1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,673
We will never see England again. We
are exiles now, like the Bad Queen.

2
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:07,311
Warwick has stumbled straight into
the arms of Margaret of Anjou.

3
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:09,126
There's nothing in it for her!

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,417
Her husband, Henry,
back on the throne of England.

5
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,137
Her son and my daughter, Anne,
to follow him when he dies.

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,377
Anne Neville is to marry
Edward of Lancaster.

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,497
When you have secured London,
I will follow to secure

8
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:20,857
the rest of the country.

9
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,577
Warwick has sailed? You're sure?

10
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,577
It may only be a matter of days.

11
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,297
I've had word from George.

12
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:28,137
He will land with
Warwick's invading army.

13
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:31,897
But as soon as we face each other
in battle, he will abandon Warwick
and fight by my side.

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,977
The King escaped with his brother,
Richard, and Uncle Anthony.

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,617
Is Edward still king?

16
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,577
I'm no longer queen?

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,897
We are in great danger.
Where is she?

18
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,617
They've gone to seek sanctuary.

19
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,217
God save the King!

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,857
God save King Henry!

21
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,777
Would you like to meet the King?

22
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:52,537
Edward is still out there.
Does that not trouble you, Warwick?

23
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,219
It's a boy!

24
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:26,737

26
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:41,097
Edward is dead?

27
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,619
His brother Richard, too.

28
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,657
It's the talk of court.

29
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,457
Their boat sank in a storm at sea,
they both drowned.

30
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,019
There are no bodies to prove this,
it could just be a rumour?

31
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,636
Margaret, look at the weather,

32
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:54,318
it would take a miracle
to survive this.

33
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,050
Besides, we know God is on our side.

34
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:02,283
Yet he gives Elizabeth a son,
her dead husband an heir!

35
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:04,363
Really, if it's God's
will for Henry to be king,

36
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:07,925
why does he put another
obstacle in the way?

37
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:15,245
Where is he? Isabel, where's George?

38
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:17,725
Where is he?

39
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:24,965
He had a visitor.

40
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:28,285
One of his mother's ladies.

41
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:31,403
She offered George
a way back to York.

42
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:33,763
Full pardon, titles returned.

43
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:37,163
If he fought for them.

44
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:40,523
I brought you here
to keep him close!

45
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:43,445
And now he's joined forces
with Edward?!

46
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:48,845
I am not your spy!

47
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:52,485
Nor his keeper.

48
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,005
Your Grace.

49
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,243
We'll take you somewhere quiet,

50
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:10,085
where you may pray for
a happy ending to our worries.

51
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:17,325
I must...

52
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:19,643
I shall...

53
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:23,243
I'm taking the King to
the Tower for his protection.

54
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,523
The sons of York have united
and mean to take back the throne.

55
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,883
My Lords,
we heard Edward perished at sea.

56
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,163
You heard wrong.

57
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:33,123
My spies in the North claim he's
landed and is about to attack.

58
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,723
Go home, raise men
and wait my call to arms.

59
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:39,205
I will await Margaret of Anjou's
call to arms!

60
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:48,123
And a true Lancastrian
will protect OUR King.

61
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,325
My Lord, the Duke of Somerset.

62
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:56,683
God save the King!

63
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:58,805
God save the King!

64
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:10,163
Margaret, you should go back
to Stafford Manor...

65
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:13,285
No, I should stay... for my son.

66
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:17,883
No, London will rise up for Edward.
He is much admired here.

67
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,725
I must go back to Wales
and raise men to fight.

68
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:24,203
I need to take Henry with me.

69
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,483
No... Margaret, you know
what's about to happen.

70
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:29,523
He's second to the throne.
He's too vulnerable in London.

71
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:33,245
We will go to Wales,
await Margaret's army...

72
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:36,725
and prepare for war.

73
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,963
We'll never reach England!

74
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,763
It's madness,
sailing into this wind!

75
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:04,125
The captain claims it is safe.
With a blade held to his neck!

76
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,163
Please, don't leave me!

77
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:28,363
You know I can't come.

78
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:30,643
You're a princess,
you must sail with the Queen.

79
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:33,803
I shall be just behind you
with the fleet.

80
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:37,043
What if Isabel was right
and this whole campaign is cursed?

81
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,003
Father failed to make
her husband king.

82
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,725
What if he can't put mine
on the throne?

83
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:45,925
Your father rests his hopes on you.
Think of him.

84
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:50,725
How proud he'll be, calling
his favourite "Princess Anne".

85
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:55,125
I do want him to know I'm trying
to play my part.

86
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,085
Then be brave.

87
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:04,565
Do as they say.

88
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:18,565
And do not, whatever you do,
cross that woman.

89
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:35,163
Cousin?

90
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:36,963
Edmund?

91
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:38,883
Margaret, I'm rather engaged.

92
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:41,045
This is in all of our interests.

93
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:44,323
You know my husband.

94
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,403
Henry Stafford. Course. Good man.

95
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,523
Mm, he's respected.

96
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:51,443
And he could, if he wished, raise
an army of tenants for our cause.

97
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,283
He is not loyal to our King?

98
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:56,803
Sir Henry's a "man of peace".

99
00:06:56,805 --> 00:07:00,363
We all want peace.
Sometimes a man must defend his own.

100
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:02,683
Precisely what I've been
telling him,

101
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:04,883
only he somehow won't
hear it from me.

102
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:08,003
But if a man, close to the King,
were to raise this with him...

103
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:11,323
I'm sure I can help him
see the light - some good ale,

104
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:13,443
a bit of persuasion...

105
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:16,883
Henry Stafford is not some young
maiden disposed to sweet-talk.

106
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:18,603
He's refused us before.

107
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,683
You must remind him of that,

108
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:24,963
of our King's debt to those who
honour him and what may happen

109
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:27,403
if he were to make another
pitiful judgment.

110
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,723
Rest assured, cousin.

111
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:31,205
Inform Sir Henry I shall be
joining him for supper later.

112
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,725
Stay back! Do not come any closer!

113
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:50,725
Who are you?!

114
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:58,003
Edward!

115
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,523
Thank God. You came back to me.

116
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,565
Of course I did. I always do.

117
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:06,123
How did you get past the guards?

118
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,563
Warwick has no men here,
they're gathering for the battle.

119
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:14,683
Elizabeth, George has been
good to his word.

120
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,565
The sons of York are... Listen!

121
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,205
The sons of York are reunited.

122
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:24,763
But we must face the Lancastrian
Army in the coming days.

123
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,883
I can't stay.

124
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:29,363
I had to see you...

125
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,365
see my son.

126
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:37,083
He's a fine weight.

127
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:39,083
Look, he has your chin.

128
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:41,725
He has your wide feet.

129
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:47,083
I've been gone too, too long.

130
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:50,165
I pray this is not
the only time we meet.

131
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:54,283
I'll come home,

132
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,245
keep you safe...

133
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:59,525
make this land better for you.

134
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:04,645
I love you, little prince.

135
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:20,845
Damn Warwick.

136
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:24,723
Making me run like a coward...

137
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,283
driving me here
to have my son in a dungeon!

138
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:29,365
We are fine.

139
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,643
Be angry, be vengeful,

140
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:36,043
but never shamed.

141
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:38,365
You ran for your life.
Nobody blames you.

142
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:46,403
I've been ambushed, captured,

143
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,523
but I was never afraid.

144
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:53,365
I was... I was young,
fearless, a king.

145
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:57,765
Knowing that Warwick
wants me dead...

146
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:00,843
Now I have a son

147
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:04,605
and I know there will be life
beyond me... Shhh.

148
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:10,163
If we win, I will make sure

149
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:12,603
this never happens again. When.

150
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,885
WHEN you win.

151
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,605
You know Warwick.

152
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:23,685
You know him.
You know his ways.

153
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,685
He taught me everything I know.

154
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:30,925
He made me king.

155
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:34,005
I loved him.

156
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:38,805
Now, I must kill him.

157
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:58,405
You're going now,
to fight the York Army?

158
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:01,205
What about me?

159
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:05,925
Where do I stand?

160
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:10,403
You are Lancaster,
George is York, Anne is my enemy,

161
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:11,725
and Mother is with her.

162
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,083
But I am all on my own!

163
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:18,523
You will be fine, whatever happens.

164
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:21,923
If I win, you've nothing to fear.

165
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,083
If I lose,
you're still married to George,

166
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:26,405
you're still Duchess of Clarence.

167
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:32,803
Just be wary.

168
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:35,403
Commit to nobody until you know
there is a clear winner,

169
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:38,325
and then remind them
of your undying loyalty...

170
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:44,085
until it serves you no more.

171
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:02,163
John, why are there tenants
in the house?

172
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:06,723
Getting their commissions, My Lady.
Sir Henry's taking them into battle.

173
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:11,523
Oh, God! Oh, God!

174
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,325
Oh, God!

175
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:16,565
Good day, My Lord.

176
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,485
Good man. Make your mark here.
My Lord.

177
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:24,285
Make ready.

178
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:27,563
Lady Margaret. Sir Reginald.

179
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:31,803
God bless you.
Oh, bless you, Henry, truly!

180
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:34,523
Margaret, Margaret, please, just...
I'm, I'm afraid...

181
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:35,883
Oh, no, don't be, don't be.

182
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:39,963
You are doing God's work,
for the king he appointed.

183
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:42,523
I'm afraid I'm fighting for York.

184
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:44,883
I'm leading the men
to serve King Edward,

185
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:47,525
because I think he'll win,
put an end to war.

186
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:50,483
I know this disappoints you.

187
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:54,243
But my, my cousin, Edmund...
you spoke at length...

188
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:55,963
He spoke, I humoured him.

189
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:58,163
Don't get others to beg
on your behalf, Margaret,

190
00:13:58,165 --> 00:14:00,523
it demeans you
and you are far more compelling.

191
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:04,483
What reason could you possibly have?

192
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:07,323
The only time we've known peace
was during King Edward's reign.

193
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:09,003
Now he has a son, it's my duty

194
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:11,203
to ensure that his succession
is peaceful.

195
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:13,763
His success? His, HIS son?

196
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,603
Look, your house does not
deserve to rule -

197
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,523
the King's half-mad,
his wife's a tyrant.

198
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,203
She hates this country
and their son is vile!

199
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:24,963
You would defy a king
appointed by God himself?

200
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:28,083
Oh, I don't see God in these people.
Look, what I'm doing is right,

201
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:32,403
I believe it's right
and it's for the good of all...
Not for me, not for my son!

202
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:36,483
You, you would have me torn -
husband one side, family the other?

203
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:40,803
Margaret, this is not about you,
your ambition -

204
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:45,205
this is for the safety,
the future of this land.

205
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,883
You do this
and I will not forgive you.

206
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:56,043
I will not pray for your return.

207
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,563
You will be dead to me.

208
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:00,163
Do you hear me, Henry Stafford?

209
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,405
You will be dead to me!

210
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:28,685
God bless you, Margaret.

211
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:32,445
Even though you will not
say it to me.

212
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,325
Go up on deck and take some air.

213
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:11,245
It stinks of bile and fear in here.

214
00:16:12,925 --> 00:16:14,205
I'm fine, really.

215
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:19,885
Really? I've seen heads on spikes
looking healthier than you.

216
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:23,403
Just not sure I'd make it.

217
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:25,805
Oh, don't be pathetic,
of course you will.

218
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:31,645
You want something enough,
you can get it, always.

219
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:35,565
Yes, Your Grace.

220
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:39,925
You're weaker than I thought.

221
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:45,883
I see something of Isabel,

222
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:49,123
but sadly, little of Lord Warwick.

223
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:53,403
I am not weak, nor like my sister.

224
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:57,605
Who are you, then?
I have no sense of Anne.

225
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,765
And I'm interested to know
what kind of queen you will be.

226
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,443
Haven't thought about it.

227
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:10,203
You're the Kingmaker's daughter.

228
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:12,405
You think about it.

229
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:29,963
Your husband will face our enemy
at Barnet, north of London.

230
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,883
There is talk that Warwick
has three times the troops

231
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,683
and still awaits reinforcements.

232
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:36,763
So, Margaret of Anjou has landed?

233
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,043
Nobody knows where she is.

234
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:42,603
But she will have set sail, soon as
there was a break in the weather.

235
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:44,883
She could even be marching
to join forces.

236
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:48,683
Surely Edward would fall back,
take the Tower, set a siege?

237
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:50,963
The King prepares to fight.

238
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:54,243
Edward must defeat Warwick
to keep the crown.

239
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:58,763
But if the Thames mist
were to rise as high as Barnet,

240
00:17:58,765 --> 00:18:00,765
who'd even know the army was there?

241
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:15,283
Other commanders will ask you to
stay and fight till the death.

242
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:18,365
Whilst readying their horses
to flee.

243
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:22,283
But let this be my pledge to you.

244
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:24,365
I will not ride off and leave you.

245
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:31,005
I will stay and fight by your side!

246
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:44,963
How many of my ships have landed?

247
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,605
All but one, although they are
scattered along the south coast.

248
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:01,605
Forget Warwick,
we must rethink our plans.

249
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:10,883
Your Graces, I come
direct... directly from London.

250
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:13,123
Your husband... the King...

251
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,403
Imprisoned, imprisoned in the Tower,
I know.

252
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:17,685
And how heavy were our losses
at Barnet?

253
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:21,803
Very. Course they were.

254
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:26,963
Let's assume Edward knows we've
landed, that he'll come for us.

255
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,165
Is my father coming here too?

256
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:34,243
My father! What of Lord Warwick?

257
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:35,445
Dead...

258
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:39,925
obviously, or he would be here.

259
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:49,563
On the battlefield, Your Grace,
the most noble death.

260
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:51,443
No. No, no, no.

261
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:55,243
No, he can't be, he's the Kingmaker.

262
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,363
He lives to see my son
on the throne... he lives...

263
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:01,883
He was a great man. Honourable.

264
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:04,563
He killed his own horse to prove
that he would not ride-off,

265
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:07,203
leave his men to die. What?

266
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,325
He fought and fell beside them.

267
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:17,763
His forces must be depleted too?

268
00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:21,083
They have the taste of victory
in their mouths, dear.

269
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:22,643
Be ready to move out.

270
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:23,685
No.

271
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:27,085
I do not run from fights.

272
00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:32,685
You would face Edward of York here,
with our numbers?

273
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:37,445
What would you do?

274
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:43,085
Head west.

275
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:46,843
My father always said,

276
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,203
"The south favours York,

277
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:54,083
"but west countrymen
have no such affinity."

278
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,083
Beg them for support.

279
00:25:56,085 --> 00:26:01,685
We are Lancastrians, we beg
for nothing. Do not speak again.

280
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:06,043
It's good, it's good.

281
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:07,645
You're thinking like me.

282
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:32,285
Does Sir Henry really think
he might die?

283
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:36,325
He's badly injured.

284
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:41,083
I will go to him.
Reginald, prepare a cart.

285
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:45,723
You... you can't ride to a
battlefield, it's not safe.

286
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:47,963
Sir Henry would not want it
or allow it.

287
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:50,323
Yes, well, I am your mistress
when he's not here.

288
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:52,885
You will do as I say. Ready my
horse. No.

289
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,403
It is hell on Earth.

290
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:00,483
It is no place for a woman.

291
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:03,365
Take me, Sir Reginald,
or I will go myself.

292
00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:10,803
Where's my liegeman Jasper Tudor?
Where is he now?

293
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,443
Pembroke Castle, Your Grace.

294
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:15,043
Send a messenger, we head to Wales.

295
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:16,763
We'll cross through Gloucester.

296
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,403
They've a bridge over the Severn.

297
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:21,403
No. Gloucester's is in York hands.
They would fire on us.

298
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:24,363
All right. Tewkesbury, then.

299
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:25,805
They've a ford.

300
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:30,043
Could you spare a guard
to take me to my mother?

301
00:27:30,045 --> 00:27:33,605
You do not want to come with us,
see if your suggestion pays off?

302
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,243
I must tell her about my father.

303
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:38,683
Oh, but she knows.

304
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:41,485
She was told first,
by the boy who delivered this.

305
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:47,965
She refused protection and took
sanctuary, in Beaulieu Abbey.

306
00:27:50,645 --> 00:27:52,483
I wish to see my mother.

307
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:55,283
She has abandoned you
and lives in disgrace.

308
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:57,563
Go to her and you will suffer
the same fate.

309
00:27:57,565 --> 00:28:00,163
No! We are Nevilles.

310
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:02,043
One of the greatest families
in the land.

311
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:05,443
Your name means nothing now.

312
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:09,243
You will be arrested and York courts
show no mercy to traitors.

313
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:12,683
But go, if that's what you want,

314
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:14,645
we don't need you any more.

315
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,725
Yes, you do.

316
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:26,963
Your son needs an heir
or your line dies out.

317
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:30,205
I could be carrying a future
King of England right now.

318
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:36,083
I'll ride with you,
because there's a hope of victory,

319
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:38,165
fulfilling my father's wish.

320
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,325
We need each other.

321
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,005
Help me.

322
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:02,645
Margaret!

323
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,643
What are you doing here?
It's... it's much too dangerous...

324
00:30:06,645 --> 00:30:09,843
I'm quite safe. Sir Reginald
and Young John brought me here.

325
00:30:09,845 --> 00:30:12,445
We have your physician
and a priest.

326
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,683
It looks worse than it is.

327
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:18,845
Please, don't worry.

328
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,005
I brought a wagon to take you back.

329
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:25,685
Oh, you needn't have...

330
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:29,445
but I shall be glad
to see my home.

331
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,725
So, York won.

332
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:40,843
It is all over?

333
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:41,965
So I thought.

334
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:49,363
But the lad who dressed my wounds
tells me that Margaret of Anjou
has landed and is marching to Wales.

335
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:50,885
To Jasper?

336
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:54,523
If Edward can catch Margaret
and put her in the Tower too,

337
00:30:54,525 --> 00:30:56,205
then it may finally be over.

338
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:04,323
If she reaches Wales,
allies with Jasper,

339
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:06,565
they'll go after Edward, finish him.

340
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:09,485
Margaret...

341
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:14,925
don't do anything to undermine
my efforts or those of my tenants.

342
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:19,923
Accept the loss, accept King Edward

343
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:21,363
and he'll look favourably on us.

344
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:24,083
I'll ask your physician
to bring you fresh bandages.

345
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:26,963
If Jasper goes against Edward
and loses,

346
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:30,005
he will have to go into exile
once more, with your son.

347
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,685
Is that what you want?

348
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:38,803
Give up, Margaret.

349
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:42,085
For once, for once,
please do as I ask.

350
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:44,645
Promise me?

351
00:31:46,645 --> 00:31:47,965
Say it.

352
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:50,765
I promise.

353
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:05,323
'Dearest Jasper, terrible news -

354
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:07,603
'my husband has turned against me

355
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:10,763
'and fought for York at Barnet.

356
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:14,683
'Warwick is dead and they have
our King, but there is hope.

357
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:17,843
'Queen Margaret has landed
and rides to Wales

358
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:20,243
'to join forces with you.

359
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:25,603
'Invade. Seize this moment and
I will do all I can to support you.

360
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:28,243
'For I will never give up.
That I promise.

361
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:32,603
'God bless you and keep you safe
from harm. And keep my Henry safe.

362
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:34,205
'Guard him with your life.'

363
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:47,323
His head should be torn off

364
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:50,123
and skewered on the Tower Gates
for all to see.

365
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,363
That's the only way
to punish traitors.

366
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:55,643
Bit rich, George, even for you.

367
00:32:55,645 --> 00:32:57,123
What was that, little brother?

368
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,843
You went against us,
down on your knees for Warwick

369
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:04,085
when you thought that he would
make you king. Richard.

370
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:08,283
You would rather your dear wife
saw her father carved up,

371
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:11,163
sent on a tour of England? No.

372
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:12,325
Obviously.

373
00:33:13,485 --> 00:33:16,043
We are here to honour one
of the finest warriors

374
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:17,803
this country has ever known.

375
00:33:17,805 --> 00:33:21,285
He fought with our father
and we would be nothing without him.

376
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:24,883
He may have only been
an in-law to you,

377
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:26,683
but he was like a brother to us.

378
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:30,723
We must remember him
for the hero he was

379
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,763
and not the traitor he became.

380
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:34,363
And we are not savages.

381
00:33:34,365 --> 00:33:37,323
We were just the ones who put him to
the sword - a touch excessively, no?

382
00:33:37,325 --> 00:33:38,563
Remember where you are.

383
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:41,603
We have won this battle,
but we have yet to win the war.

384
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:43,285
And I cannot have this!

385
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:51,365
George is loyal to your husband,
it seems.

386
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:54,565
Today.

387
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,885
We may have to forgive him...

388
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,605
leave our vengeance to God.

389
00:34:05,365 --> 00:34:06,445
Never.

390
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:42,723
Leave us.

391
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:44,405
I have to go again, tonight.

392
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:48,565
You hope to capture
Margaret of Anjou?

393
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:53,405
She is riding west to join forces
with Jasper Tudor.

394
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:58,885
Just do whatever it takes
to end this.

395
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:03,003
If one battle can bring peace
to England, peace of mind,

396
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:04,525
it's one worth fighting.

397
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:08,805
And you will be back in no time.

398
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:14,245
You have more faith in me
than I ever had in myself.

399
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:20,005
I remember meeting a fairly
confident boy under an oak tree,
some years ago.

400
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:26,803
Anthony will guard you in the Tower.

401
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:28,165
Keep you out of danger.

402
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:33,565
And who will keep YOU out of danger?

403
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:37,403
Elizabeth, if something
were to happen... Don't.

404
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:39,883
There's a man in Flanders
who will take you in,

405
00:35:39,885 --> 00:35:41,963
your mother knows where to meet him.

406
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:45,525
You must hide for a while till
the little one is older...

407
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,045
and he will take the throne.

408
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:55,365
You've said all of this before
and you came back to me then.

409
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:03,925
You will die in my bed.

410
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,603
This is what it is to be
Queen militant -

411
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:38,803
you have to fight for what you own.

412
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:41,283
Remember these odds, this pain,

413
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:46,283
for if we win, you will never
have to march again.

414
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:49,723
Don't you ever tire
of living like this?

415
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:53,763
Never. This is what I live for.

416
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:55,403
Even if it means you're hated?

417
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:57,323
I've never been liked.

418
00:36:57,325 --> 00:37:00,043
I'm damned twice
in most men's eyes -

419
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:04,043
I'm the woman who dared to rule
when her husband could not

420
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:07,123
and who fought to ensure
her only son's position.

421
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:10,483
Now, how could I do such a thing?

422
00:37:10,485 --> 00:37:11,845
Men!

423
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:15,803
Why "damned twice"?

424
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:18,285
Because I'm French, of course!

425
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:27,165
Tewkesbury!

426
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:31,683
Once we cross the river,

427
00:37:31,685 --> 00:37:36,163
we are midway to victory.

428
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:39,643
We will join Jasper Tudor's forces,

429
00:37:39,645 --> 00:37:44,283
return to England
and hunt Edward down!

430
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:47,885
May God grant us victory!

431
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:53,923
Your Grace. Yes. The river...

432
00:37:53,925 --> 00:37:55,723
it's too high from this rain...

433
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:59,963
And we will all die in the morning
if we are caught this side
of the border.

434
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:02,363
Edward is closing fast.

435
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,005
This was your idea.

436
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:11,323
We have no option other than
to camp and cross at first light.

437
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:15,523
You cannot stay here.
You must take refuge in the abbey.

438
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:18,843
Camp here,
then take up the best positions

439
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:22,283
and get your men into battle lines.

440
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:24,163
Now?

441
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:27,203
Edward of York has
the speed of the devil,

442
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:30,043
he prepares in darkness,
and conquers in mist.

443
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:34,083
You must use every advantage
and be ready,

444
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:37,045
be ready to fight for your lives!

445
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:43,965
Keep him safe.

446
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:47,365
We will go to the abbey.

447
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:56,003
Lady Mother!

448
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:57,523
All be very brave.

449
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,043
Are we being attacked?!

450
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,445
They've come out the River Thames
for now.

451
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:04,483
Who are?

452
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:06,203
Lancastrian soldiers.

453
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:08,683
Trying to rescue old King Henry.
How many?

454
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:10,563
They have warships. So keep back.

455
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:12,205
Shh!

456
00:39:26,525 --> 00:39:28,445
Sister, which way is your chapel?

457
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:33,643
Light a candle for the living too.

458
00:39:33,645 --> 00:39:39,123
Your fate lies with your husband,
not your dead father.

459
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,085
I will pray for both.

460
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:44,763
And for me.

461
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:46,603
Edward is my only son.

462
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:50,085
Pray God spares him,
for all our sakes.

463
00:39:58,245 --> 00:40:00,523
How are you? The baby is well?

464
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:02,803
Now that has stopped. And you?

465
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:07,043
Tired, my ears are ringing,
but we've withstood all they have.

466
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:08,643
For now?

467
00:40:08,645 --> 00:40:12,403
They've moored their boats,
set up camp not far from here.

468
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:14,083
We'll come under siege at dawn.

469
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:16,123
Do we have enough men
to resist them?

470
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:19,763
The apprentice boys
have been flocking in all night.
They'll help to contain them.

471
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,403
So we just wait for our enemies
to recover, and then storm us?!

472
00:40:22,405 --> 00:40:25,043
What do you suggest, sister?
Strike back!

473
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:28,443
Stopping them from coming
any closer to my family.

474
00:40:28,445 --> 00:40:31,005
Let's attack them
when they least expect it.

475
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:35,683
Most men would prefer to die
in their sleep, would they not?

476
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:39,645
Spoken like a true Yorkist.
We attack before dawn.

477
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:27,685
Here. Drink this.

478
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:35,883
Your Grace, The Duke... Duke
of Somerset,

479
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:38,923
he said to tell you
if I thought the battle lost...

480
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:41,885
He fled to a church,
but Edward dragged him out.

481
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:49,883
And my son? The Prince of Wales?

482
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,805
I must fetch Your Graces' horses.

483
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:03,363
Get a cape, a blanket and bread.

484
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:07,283
I'll meet you by the stables.
Shouldn't we wait for Prince Edward?

485
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:09,643
Just be ready to leave, will you?

486
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:12,003
This is not the first time
I've fled a battlefield

487
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:13,963
and it may not be the last.

488
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,923
No!

489
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:20,323
I'm tired, running and doing
what you say, I'm so tired.

490
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:23,083
Look at me. Look at me, Anne!

491
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:25,083
They will be here any moment

492
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:29,765
and men with blood on their hands
are no respecters of title or age.

493
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:34,805
We must go. And we must go now.

494
00:42:38,925 --> 00:42:40,843
When I open the gate, ride hard.

495
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:44,005
Don't look to the battle, don't look
back, just get away from here.

496
00:42:57,245 --> 00:42:58,405
No!

497
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:01,243
Don't touch me!

498
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,563
No, no, no!

499
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:05,803
Get off! Don't touch me!

500
00:43:05,805 --> 00:43:08,365
No! No! No!

501
00:43:14,645 --> 00:43:18,245
I am Anne Neville!
I am the Kingmaker's daughter!

502
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:22,325
No!

503
00:43:30,165 --> 00:43:31,205
Lady Anne?

504
00:43:35,925 --> 00:43:36,965
Princess.

505
00:43:38,645 --> 00:43:40,165
I am Princess Anne.

506
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:46,845
Dowager Princess.

507
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:52,165
My husband is dead?

508
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,165
Are you hurt?

509
00:43:57,165 --> 00:43:58,765
It's over. You are safe now.

510
00:44:02,045 --> 00:44:04,163
His mother...

511
00:44:04,165 --> 00:44:05,605
I must tell her.

512
00:44:06,885 --> 00:44:09,965
I've been charged by the King
to take you into his care.

513
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:15,445
His Grace, the Prince of Wales?

514
00:44:17,685 --> 00:44:18,725
Died...

515
00:44:20,565 --> 00:44:22,083
in battle.

516
00:44:22,085 --> 00:44:24,883
Your commanders have been captured.

517
00:44:24,885 --> 00:44:26,685
I am to take you to London.

518
00:44:30,845 --> 00:44:32,963
I refuse.

519
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:35,403
I don't have to go anywhere.

520
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:37,283
I am Queen.

521
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:39,563
Now, leave us to grieve.

522
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:41,165
I said leave us!

523
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:46,243
Get on your horse or I'll have you
bound and gagged

524
00:44:46,245 --> 00:44:48,203
and thrown into a litter.

525
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:51,685
Be grateful the King wants to show
you as a part of his triumph.

526
00:44:53,685 --> 00:44:55,205
You are bold...

527
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:58,205
you're a fine soldier...

528
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:02,925
but you're nothing
while your brother lives.

529
00:45:04,365 --> 00:45:06,803
Come to me, get me out of here

530
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:08,605
and I will name you as my heir.

531
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:12,965
I will make you King of England.

532
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:16,925
You can even have her.

533
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:27,605
No.

534
00:45:29,085 --> 00:45:31,165
I am not yours to give now.

535
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:12,925
My boy.

536
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,045
My boy.

537
00:46:53,885 --> 00:46:59,883
Jasper plans to take Henry into
exile again, as you predicted.

538
00:46:59,885 --> 00:47:01,325
Oh...

539
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:05,045
I hoped, for you,
it wouldn't come to that.

540
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:11,243
What of Jasper?

541
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:16,003
He's safe, he didn't reach the
Queen.

542
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:17,845
He worries for my son.

543
00:47:19,205 --> 00:47:20,723
Now Edward has seized power,

544
00:47:20,725 --> 00:47:23,605
what's to stop him
killing all his enemies at once?

545
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,845
I would see him and his witch burn
for what they have done to my
family.

546
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,605
Let me to go to Tenby to see them.

547
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:42,683
No. No, I can't.

548
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:44,405
I have to say goodbye to my boy.

549
00:47:48,525 --> 00:47:49,885
I know the risks...

550
00:47:52,325 --> 00:47:54,725
but I don't know
when I'll see Henry again.

551
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:00,885
Thank you.

552
00:48:06,765 --> 00:48:08,405
Thank you.

553
00:48:09,925 --> 00:48:11,723
Thank you.

554
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:12,925
You're a good man.

555
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:37,005
My son is the most precious thing
in my life.

556
00:48:38,005 --> 00:48:40,565
You are the only man
I trust to look after him.

557
00:48:43,765 --> 00:48:46,683
We fought hard to try
and get to Margaret's army.

558
00:48:46,685 --> 00:48:53,603
I lost men, good men,
trying to cross,

559
00:48:53,605 --> 00:48:57,165
and then watched a massacre,
unable to...

560
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:01,043
I failed my Queen.

561
00:49:01,045 --> 00:49:02,723
No, No. You tried.

562
00:49:02,725 --> 00:49:04,163
God knows you tried.

563
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:07,605
Don't talk to me of God, for He was
not at Tewkesbury that day.

564
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:11,965
Forgive me...

565
00:49:14,805 --> 00:49:17,243
And now, here we are again,

566
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:20,485
running for our lives,
not knowing when we might return.

567
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:25,843
You are safe. My son is safe

568
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:29,323
and we are closer to God's will.

569
00:49:29,325 --> 00:49:32,963
Prince Edward's death puts us
nearer the throne.

570
00:49:32,965 --> 00:49:34,205
Yes.

571
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:37,925
Please God you're right.

572
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,723
Look after your uncle.

573
00:49:45,725 --> 00:49:48,445
You have him, he has nobody.

574
00:49:51,605 --> 00:49:53,083
I will.

575
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:55,485
God bless you and keep you.

576
00:49:57,445 --> 00:50:00,845
We may be beaten,
but that is now. Things change.

577
00:50:02,725 --> 00:50:04,205
Never give up.

578
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:08,045
I won't.

579
00:50:13,365 --> 00:50:17,763
Forget the Bad Queen,
she does not deserve your sympathy.

580
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,645
You remember what we called her?

581
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:22,963
What will happen?

582
00:50:22,965 --> 00:50:26,483
Spend the rest of her days in the
Tower, I imagine, like her husband.

583
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:27,805
Is that my fate too?

584
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:34,245
I hope not.

585
00:50:36,285 --> 00:50:38,043
Am I not a traitor?

586
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:39,683
I married your enemy.

587
00:50:39,685 --> 00:50:42,125
I'm sure you only did
what you were told.

588
00:50:46,285 --> 00:50:47,485
Anne?

589
00:50:49,245 --> 00:50:53,923
When we landed here,
I had a choice.

590
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,123
I could've gone to my mother,
but I didn't.

591
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,045
I chose to stay with the Bad Queen.

592
00:50:59,965 --> 00:51:01,645
You chose to fight on.

593
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:05,165
You are your father's daughter.

594
00:51:10,045 --> 00:51:11,445
Do you love me, Anne?

595
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:14,405
What?

596
00:51:16,405 --> 00:51:19,045
Do you love me... and the King?

597
00:51:22,765 --> 00:51:24,885
Let's hope that's enough for Edward.

598
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:29,603
I'll take you to your sister
when the court returns to London.

599
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:30,805
Really?

600
00:51:33,085 --> 00:51:36,125
I would like to see Isabel,
very, very much.

601
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:45,525
Daddy!

602
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:43,925
I've sent a messenger
for the priest.

603
00:53:08,245 --> 00:53:10,083
Henry?

604
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:11,485
Glad you're home.

605
00:53:13,645 --> 00:53:14,685
Here.

606
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:28,245
No.

607
00:53:36,605 --> 00:53:38,725
Your boy, Henry, safely away?

608
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,245
You must apply for his return later.

609
00:53:46,205 --> 00:53:48,765
They will not refuse
when they hear about me.

610
00:53:52,285 --> 00:53:54,365
I know you never wanted to marry.

611
00:53:56,485 --> 00:53:58,205
And I've disappointed you...

612
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,325
not suited to the times,
I suppose.

613
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:12,445
Stop fighting to be Margaret Regina.

614
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,723
Just be Margaret

615
00:54:17,725 --> 00:54:19,445
or Sister Margaret.

616
00:54:23,485 --> 00:54:25,165
Do whatever makes you happy.

617
00:54:30,205 --> 00:54:31,645
Perhaps you will pick up?

618
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:38,165
Bless you. And your son.

619
00:54:40,325 --> 00:54:44,123
I wish we could have had our own,

620
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:45,885
but I am no less fond of him.

621
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:49,325
A fine young man.

622
00:55:00,285 --> 00:55:03,443
Make peace with the Yorks.

623
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:05,245
And bring him home safe.

624
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:10,885
For peace, Margaret...

625
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,805
Girls, girls.
