1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,080
'I here present unto you, Queen
Elizabeth, your undoubted queen.'

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,320
We'll have no truck with a queen
who thought to rule her husband

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,640
and rule England through him.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,600
My Lords! Our one-time king, Henry,
and now, our prisoner.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,640
Your father is asking
King Edward for the royal dukes,

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,040
his brothers, to be given
in marriage to the two of you.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,200
Give him something. But not this.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,160
Warwick has betrayed me!
And so has George!

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,640
For now I hear he has married
Isabel against my clear command!

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,200
My wedding was never for me at all.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,000
It was a sign from Father that men
should rise against the King.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,280
You will be
King Henry Tudor of England.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Ignore what your mother just
said, Henry, for it is treason

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
and she would surely lose
her head for it.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,640
Our father...and John...
they're dead.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,400
There was no charge,
only the word of Warwick.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,120
He's done it. Father has the King!

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick.
I curse you.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,000
By my will, you shall die.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,120
There is no word?

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,360
Anthony and Richard have ridden
north to test support for Warwick.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,760
They may just be captured and meet
the same fate as John and Father.

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,640
Please, Elizabeth, don't even
say that! How can I help it?

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,760
Mad King Henry
is safe and in comfort

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,240
but what are they doing to Edward?

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,920
What are they doing to him,
right now, Mother, as I stand here?

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,600
I need him back with me.

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,240
(Sssh...sssh... I know.)

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,560
"Advise me", Warwick?!

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,720
Not lock me up or take away
my throne,

32
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,800
but, no, you would "advise me"?!
Edward, the council feels...

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,760
No, it doesn't!

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,720
The council feels nothing
but what you tell it,

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,760
and you will turn them against me!

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,360
Edward, all we ask is that you
take back your old advisors

37
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,040
and dismiss the Rivers family.
Which you know I will never do!

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,960
So, the game is that you make
demands on me

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,960
you know I cannot agree to, and use
that as your excuse to keep me here

40
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,080
while George rules in my place!

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,080
But really, you rule through him.

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
Edward! The loyalty
that we had to...

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,240
No! I am "Your Grace" to you,
cousin!

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,400
The Lord's anointed king
and ruler of this kingdom!

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,600
And Your Grace needs to understand
that this is a betrayal

46
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,680
and that the Queen's family...
Are loyal to me!

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,360
Which is more than can
be said for you and George.

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,120
Now, where is the Queen

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,160
because if you have harmed
a single hair upon her head...

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,600
She would have likely sent
the Devil down upon me!

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,080
But she is barricaded in the Tower.

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,160
Now that, dear cousin,

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,840
is treason!

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
As is this.

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,560
But, if I must hold court
at Warwick Castle,

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,800
then you may bring me some venison
and some small ale

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,680
so I may eat at your expense
as I run my kingdom!

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
Is that clear to you?

59
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,040
Ssh...

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,160
Yes, and bring me brother George
as I have words to say to him.

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,120
Ah! Brother George's
new wife, Isabel,

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,120
married without my consent.
(Would you get them in there?)

63
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,280
I do hope you're not expecting
loyalty from him!

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,400
Will you get them in there! Go, go!

65
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,920
She's not bled yet?

66
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,640
She's with child.

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,880
A wedding night child
shows we have God's blessing.

68
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,560
Is it a boy?
I... How would I know, Father?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,320
I have called a Parliament at York

70
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,640
where we will proclaim George
the king and Isabel his queen.

71
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,640
But, Father! I cannot! Be quiet,
Isabel! It may as well be over with.

72
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,440
He knows full well what we're doing.
You cannot turn back now.

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,400
You must stay your course
come hell or glory.

74
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,840
But Parliament will never agree!
They must!

75
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,200
The Rivers woman is so hated.

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
She has pushed aside your father

77
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,480
and every other noble advisor
England ever had.

78
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,360
And in their place, put scum. You
will not question me. Now get out!

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,440
(You may question him when you
are queen... You may do then!)

80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,160
Husband?

81
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,440
I have word from Jasper Tudor!

82
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,880
Jasper says that Parliament
is sitting at York

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,200
and they will decide what
to do with Edward!

84
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,640
They should just cut his head off.

85
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,200
Is that what you'd do, Margaret?
Take a man's life so readily? Hmm?

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,560
He has gone against his rightful
king and God. My Lord. Thank you.

87
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,360
I would do it myself
if I were a man.

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,320
I would do it myself anyway,
as Joan of Arc would have done.

89
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Perhaps we should be grateful that
it's not your choice to make.

90
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,040
It is not I who choose it,
but the Lord.

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,240
He tells me of his will
and I carry out his work.

92
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,520
He has ruled Edward
should lose the throne,

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240
and soon, he will reveal
the way my son shall come upon it.

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,640
Or rather, you will decree

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,160
whatever action that you take
to be God's will!

96
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,440
Jasper understands all of this.
I did not imagine that you would!

97
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,160
Ah, yes, Jasper Tudor.

98
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Does he share your blood-lust too,
Margaret?

99
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,240
Would he lop off the head of
a king ordained by God?

100
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,120
Jasper and I are one in all things.

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,360
No, not all, Margaret.
You're not married to Jasper Tudor.

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,600
You are married to me.

103
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
George!

104
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,640
You coward! Come and face
me like a man!

105
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,960
Don't hide behind our cousin,
George!

106
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,640
Does our mother know about this?!
Damn you, Edward!

107
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,920
I'll not allow that witch
upon the throne,

108
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,360
and you've been no king since you
first dipped your wick in her!

109
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,080
George?
Off to Parliament, Warwick,

110
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,640
to try and force the crown
on George's head?!

111
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,680
Issy!
Look what they have sent for you!

112
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
It is her coronation furs.
Elizabeth's!

113
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,760
They have taken them
from the Palace of Westminster!

114
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,920
They still smell of her perfume.

115
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,720
Only kings and queens
may wear this fur!

116
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,440
You shall be queen, Issy.

117
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,400
Aren't you happy?!

118
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,040
Father has done this for you,
Isabel.

119
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,800
If he had done it for me,
I'd be the happiest girl in England.

120
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,320
There are two queens already, Annie.

121
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,000
One is in exile the other
is cowering in the Tower

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,600
with a price upon her head.
I would be the third queen.

123
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,640
So, what if Father turns against us
as he's done both the others?!

124
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,560
He will not turn against you.

125
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,640
You are carrying the prince,
his grandson.

126
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,200
There is no-one else for Father now.

127
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,640
We all said that Edward
was the rightful king.

128
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,240
We said that he
was the Flower of York

129
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,680
and we would walk in the sweet
garden of England with him.

130
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,600
We danced at her coronation.
We said that we loved her.

131
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,720
You and I never said that, Issy,

132
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,320
we did not like her.

133
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,160
Not ever.

134
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,320
Father says we must think of her
as our enemy and so we must.

135
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,160
Look how beautiful this is.

136
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,840
Remember when we used
to play at being queen?

137
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,800
Well, you can be queen in real life.
I don't want to be queen, Annie.

138
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,880
I thought that this marriage
was for me. But it's not.

139
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
It's all for them.

140
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,040
We are their pieces
on a board, Annie.

141
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,880
And marriage is a wretched thing.

142
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
It's not like it is for her.

143
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,280
We'll never be who she is.

144
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,040
We'll never have what she has.

145
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,080
My Lords!
Parliament is called to order.

146
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,600
..I shall be a strong leader.
The whole country behind me...

147
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,280
..To turn against your own brother.
The throne has the rightful king.

148
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,320
No crown, George?

149
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
You clearly couldn't
command Parliament.

150
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,040
So, you must let me go,
or you must kill me.

151
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,800
Because there is no other
end to this.

152
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
George... George!

153
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,480
Take it off!

154
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,200
I SAID, "TAKE IT OFF"!

155
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,280
George will not be king.
Parliament would not agree.

156
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,080
Your father has risked everything,
and he has lost.

157
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,360
He has lost.

158
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,640
(Elizabeth!)

159
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,720
Welcome home. King Edward!
King Edward!

160
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,880
They lost their nerve.

161
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,080
George said he would behead me,
but of course, he would not dare.

162
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,240
Not even Warwick has
the stomach for that!

163
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
He thought I was still that boy
that he could control.

164
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,960
He tried to make me give you up
but I told him

165
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,680
that I would happily stay
in his house for ever,

166
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,040
but never would
I give up my wife nor who I am.

167
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,200
They are fools to think it.
So, he just released you?

168
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,960
Parliament wouldn't declare
for George and make him king,

169
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,760
so if Edward wouldn't abdicate
and they wouldn't kill him...

170
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,200
Warwick let me out for exercise,
so he could save his pride.

171
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
But really, he just let him go.

172
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,960
And now he will be sorry.

173
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,800
You know about my brother John,
and Father?

174
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,880
So, they will pay for it.

175
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,640
You won't like it, but they won't.

176
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,800
We must have peace, Elizabeth.

177
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,920
And I was a fool not to see
that I had shut Lord Warwick out.

178
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,720
But he knows that he has lost

179
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,960
and he will beg for my forgiveness
as will George.

180
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,120
You must not give it! I will.

181
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,920
They are my brother and my cousin.

182
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,040
And this country cannot
stand another war,

183
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
especially one within this family.

184
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,920
And I will make Warwick's nephew
Duke of Bedford.

185
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,280
My first husband's title?

186
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,280
He's Warwick's heir and I must give
him some stake in staying loyal.

187
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,200
He is a traitor.

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,640
I don't care what his nephew gets,
as long as you execute Warwick!

189
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,560
I can't, my love. And I won't.

190
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,480
And what is more, I will
give our daughter, Elizabeth,

191
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,280
to young Bedford in marriage
to make that alliance firm.

192
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,880
Over my dead body!

193
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,600
We must. For then even Warwick
will have a chance of his blood

194
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,520
being on the throne one day and
he will not come against me again.

195
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,880
I swear to you that she will never
marry Warwick's nephew.

196
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Then forgive me for being worried
out of my wits about you

197
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,400
and trying to keep you safe!

198
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,920
But they would have murdered YOU.

199
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,960
So while I am King of England,
I shall give my daughter in marriage

200
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,200
to anybody I please, and no-one,
including you, shall stop me!

201
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,200
(Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

202
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,960
(Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven...)

203
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,480
I am no longer the King's Sheriff.

204
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,120
And I've been passed over
for my family title by him.

205
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,560
Yes, that's right, the King is free.

206
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,200
And he regrets to inform me

207
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,560
that you and Jasper Tudor wrote
to his brother George

208
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,400
and offered your support.

209
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,920
So my younger brother John
becomes the Earl of Wiltshire

210
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,760
which should have come to me.

211
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,880
For all your hopes of greatness,
you have hurt only yourself

212
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,280
and you will only ever be
Lady Stafford.

213
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,600
I hope that you're happy.

214
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,960
You will write no more letters.

215
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,880
You will write to no-one at all.
Especially Jasper Tudor.

216
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,880
And if I find that you have
I shall take away your books,

217
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,920
your freedoms and your visits to
your son. Is that clear, Margaret?

218
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,160
IS IT CLEAR?!

219
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,360
They're coming here for Christmas?

220
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,400
We're not even out of mourning!

221
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,600
I do not want to be here.

222
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,960
She will know
that I have worn her furs

223
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,120
and she will put her Evil Eye
upon us.

224
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,840
She'll not care about us
any more, Issy.

225
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,960
She will still hate us.
Because of Father.

226
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,600
Maybe with them close to us

227
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,920
our curse can do its work.

228
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll make them my ladies-in-waiting.

229
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,080
Welcome to court.

230
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,120
Warwick.

231
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,720
George.

232
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,760
The prodigals return.

233
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,120
Your Grace...

234
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,240
Lady Rivers.

235
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,400
I am sorry for your loss.

236
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,120
By which you mean
the brutal slaying of my father

237
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,800
and my brother who were innocent
of any crime in all their lives

238
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,360
and merely obedient to their Lord
and king?

239
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,160
In the fortunes of war...

240
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,280
It was NOT war.

241
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,800
This was no honourable death
on a battlefield.

242
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,920
It was murder.

243
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,160
And it was treason
in the eyes of God and man.

244
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,840
Your Grace.... Be quiet.

245
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,320
Your Grace, I must return
to my Lord and husband...

246
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,080
You will go whenever I command it,
Countess Warwick.

247
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,120
And all of you will dance
to whatever tune I sing.

248
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Would you like to dance, dear
sister? No, thank you, Anthony.

249
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,880
Anthony's been talking
about his trip to Italy...

250
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,200
I can't...

251
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,680
Your Grace.

252
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,480
You shouldn't even be here!

253
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,920
Thomas!

254
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Ah, such passion(!)

255
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,960
I am only glad that he and his
brother were not with my father

256
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,400
to be butchered by your axe.

257
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,680
So am I! That would have
been too awful for you.

258
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,480
I know that you do not like me
and that you plot against the king.

259
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,320
And while he may forgive you,
I promise I NEVER will.

260
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,000
Never.

261
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,240
Lord Warwick.

262
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,360
My aunt, Duchess Cecily.
Season's greetings.

263
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,880
Another one of us returned to court!

264
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,800
My dear son, George, invited me,

265
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,400
to share his joy
that he is soon to have an heir.

266
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,520
Seems the force that had me
exiled from the court

267
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,480
has lost its power
and Edward is a man again.

268
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,800
He has always been a man.

269
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,360
But it seems that that is not enough

270
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
to win the loyalty of those
who are supposed to love him.

271
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,200
Sister.

272
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,080
More land for the traitors?

273
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,160
I wonder that it does not
make you sick.

274
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,160
For the nobles, my love,
and this is what it is to be king.

275
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,040
I give out wealth and favours

276
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,800
or else they may wish that good
old Henry was back on the throne,

277
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,880
or his son, Edward,

278
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,680
or my brother, George.

279
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,160
Or, God forbid, Margaret
Beaufort's son, Henry Tudor,

280
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,320
"Let's have Lancaster back!"
She surely cannot hope for him?

281
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,680
There are too many others
in line before him!

282
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,600
Ah, Warwick! There you are!
I have something for you.

283
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,720
So, how are our newlyweds, hmm?

284
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,040
Is your daughter mad with love
for my troublesome brother George?

285
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,000
They give thanks that God has
blessed them with a child so soon.

286
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
They have hopes it may be a boy.

287
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,080
We all pray for sons.

288
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,400
I have to have a son.

289
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,040
Choose.

290
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,120
Choose which one you will draw in.

291
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,960
This one.

292
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Are you sure?

293
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,600
Yes.

294
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,240
Very well then...

295
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,440
Draw it in.

296
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,120
See what you have chosen.

297
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,400
It's a baby's spoon!

298
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,080
Turn it over.

299
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,280
"Edward"!

300
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,480
Oh, Mother! I'm going
to have a boy named Edward!

301
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,160
Come to bed, my love.

302
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,000
Mmm, something's made you
very hungry!

303
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,840
You will wait.

304
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,440
Unlace my dress.

305
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,520
Hurry up.

306
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,800
Ah...

307
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,080
You see how Edward forgives
me anything?

308
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,760
I cannot bear it, Father.
She is too awful to me!

309
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,160
Do not fret, my little moth.

310
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,480
You shall have your moment
in the light.

311
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
We are close to the throne...

312
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,440
(But soon, we shall
be closer still.)

313
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
A marriage for me?

314
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,160
Richard? No. Not Richard.

315
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,240
He is heart and soul for the King.

316
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,720
Do your duty.

317
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,800
Never forget who you are,

318
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,480
and the great name that you bear.

319
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,400
For a while, we must all
suffer hardship

320
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,800
but it will all be worth it,

321
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,720
for we will have
what we are owed and Edward...

322
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,000
..will never betray me again.

323
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,880
My Lady?

324
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,080
What do you mean,
"another uprising"?

325
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,320
In favour of witless old Henry.

326
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,520
With a leader
who will not announce his name.

327
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,880
A leader with no name? I do not see.

328
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,840
He may be a herald
to Margaret of Anjou,

329
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,280
testing how much support she can
raise before she lands her troops

330
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,640
to free her husband,
so I will make quick work of him.

331
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,160
Can someone else not lead the army?

332
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,440
No, it is my crown.
I must defend it.

333
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,640
I must put my neck on the line
with the men who love me.

334
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,160
Edward, please, don't go.

335
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm with child again.

336
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,000
And this time I'm SURE it's a boy.

337
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,360
Oh, I knew it! That's the best news
you could give me!

338
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,960
How are you so sure it's a boy?

339
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,280
Would you pry into
a woman's mysteries?

340
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,280
No, I would not.

341
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,240
Then, please, stay.
This time, to protect us both?

342
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,040
It is all the more reason
I must defend my crown

343
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,600
for my son to inherit.

344
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,240
My prince...

345
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,120
we will call Edward.

346
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,640
Edward.

347
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,240
What about your faithful cousin
Warwick and loyal George?

348
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,720
Will they ride with you?

349
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,560
Hah! My little queen of mistrust,

350
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,200
Warwick is in the north
raising men for me as we speak.

351
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,440
And George will be by my side.
In body perhaps, but not in spirit.

352
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,760
They have promised me their loyalty,
Elizabeth. Truly you must trust me.

353
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,120
I will be home with you by
May Day morning

354
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,880
with peaches and salt cod,
for you and my prince, Edward.

355
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,200
Annie, feel! He's excited.

356
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,640
He is strong! Or she is.

357
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,520
Father, what is it?
A rebellion. Against the King.

358
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,840
Jasper! Jasper!

359
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,680
My Lady Margaret.

360
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,000
You haven't written.

361
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,400
My husband has forbidden me.
What is it?

362
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,520
There is an uprising.
Our time has come at last!

363
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,400
Queen Margaret is sailing?

364
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,480
She is in Calais and will sail once
Edward is engaged in battle.

365
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,560
Oxford brings 10,000 men from
the south, and I have half of Wales.

366
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,280
So, you must arm your tenants
and go. The tide is turning.

367
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,080
It is our moment.

368
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,280
I won't ride out.

369
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,040
And I shall send no-one. What?

370
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,600
These wars have taken too
many men already.

371
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,880
I've lost a brother
and a father to this cause,

372
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,520
and still, it is not won.
I, too, have lost my kinsmen...

373
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,440
and that is exactly
why we must fight on,

374
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,400
so that their sacrifice
is not for nothing.

375
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,640
If we rise up now as one,
we can unseat this York usurper

376
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,760
and return the throne to Lancaster!

377
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,240
Until the next time.
And the next time.

378
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,000
Does King Henry even know that
this war is being fought?!

379
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,080
He barely even knows his name.

380
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,040
And Edward is the better king.

381
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,760
The roads are safe, the nobles'
private armies are disbanded

382
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,120
and brigands have been brought
to justice.
Perhaps that is what matters.

383
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,480
What matters is God's rightful
king upon the throne!

384
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,240
Or do you abandon the Lord
as well as your House?

385
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,880
Oh, no!
Edward is also anointed by God.

386
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,320
So, how should we know which one
to pick?!

387
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,560
Perhaps God is confused
and doesn't know himself?

388
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,080
And now you blaspheme and blame
almighty God for your own shame!?

389
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,320
You are a coward and you fear
for your own neck like a child!

390
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,440
And I ask God, every day, why
I must be married to such a man!

391
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,400
Enough, Margaret! Enough!
No. No, it is not enough!

392
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,360
It is not!

393
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,880
How can I live
with such bitter shame?

394
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,400
I am sorry for you.

395
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,720
He has no backbone and no loyalty.

396
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,120
We will defeat them without him.

397
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,440
I only wish I could ride
with you and fight myself.

398
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,840
You have the courage of any man.

399
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,080
You're a soldier.

400
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,720
Margaret.

401
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,680
The uprising is not called
by Margaret of Anjou.

402
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,600
It is stirred by Warwick
and George, Duke of Clarence.

403
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
What do you mean?

404
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,720
George has written that he will
return your son his title,

405
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,640
if we bring men to the field
to fight Edward.

406
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,440
It's a trick to lure Edward
into battle. Once he is engaged,

407
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,000
Warwick and George will turn
their armies on him and kill him.

408
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
They need us there
to work the deception.

409
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,280
That's why I need Stafford's men.
They'll put George on the throne?!

410
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,840
Yes, but George is weak and greedy

411
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,920
and men will quickly tire of him.

412
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,640
When they do, they will turn
to Lancaster.

413
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,440
Then we'll make
a chance for your boy.

414
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,480
I will go to my brother, Welles, and
ask him to raise an army for you.

415
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,920
He will do it
if he thinks it is for Lancaster.

416
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,680
Jasper, take this...

417
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,760
..and know that...I'm with you.

418
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,160
Oh, no, Mother, no!

419
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,200
I don't want to be the queen!

420
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,360
I only want my baby!

421
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,160
Why must Father do it?

422
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,080
I do not know why he must.
He is possessed with it.

423
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,240
He risks his life and fortune
and the safety of all four of us.

424
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,480
He says that Edward is not
a king for England.

425
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,040
He's only for the Rivers family.
Oh, Mother! No!

426
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,160
He says that he did not fight
this long

427
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,920
to put Edward's cat's-paw
of a wife upon the throne.

428
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,320
Stop bleating, Isabel! Be quiet.

429
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,560
We must support him.

430
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,880
We must, all of us, stand with him

431
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,360
and just pray to God
he is successful in this venture.

432
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
God help us all if he is not.

433
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,600
My Lord.

434
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,960
I owe you an apology.

435
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,920
I spoke to you very wrongly today.
I beg your forgiveness.

436
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,320
What did you give Jasper Tudor?

437
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,200
A necklace.

438
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,680
He gave it to me when
I left Pembroke.

439
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,040
I should not have kept
a trinket from another man.

440
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,200
God has given me a sign that I must
be a good and loyal wife to you.

441
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,400
I wish to make amends.

442
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
And to my mother, also.

443
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,600
Will you take me to see my mother?

444
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,840
So I may show contrition?

445
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,600
Very well.

446
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,760
To what do I owe SUCH an honour?

447
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,120
Mwah.

448
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,280
Welles!

449
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,920
Margaret. Lord Stafford.

450
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,680
Richard, will you pray with me?

451
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,680
Richard, I have something
to tell you.

452
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,240
Something wonderful.

453
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,760
God has commanded the nobles
of England to fight his holy war,

454
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,240
to strike down this pretender,
Edward,

455
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,120
who took the throne from his
own righteous king, Henry.

456
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,240
Richard, God has spoken to me...

457
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,680
..of you!

458
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,480
Yes, Richard, you are special,
and you are to do God's work.

459
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,280
What would he have me do?
You are to lead his blessed crusade.

460
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,880
You are to summon the army

461
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,200
that will cast this wicked Edward
from God's throne.

462
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,200
But I have...not ever...
fought in battle!

463
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,840
I do not even know...

464
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,520
Sssh...sssh...sssh...sssh...

465
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,120
All you must do is bring the army.
God will do the rest.

466
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,600
When he does, he will place a new
Lancastrian king upon the throne,

467
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,200
and where do you think
he will look for that king,

468
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,160
if you have led his House
of Lancaster to victory?

469
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,480
Dear God,

470
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,360
please, watch over Edward
in this battle that is coming.

471
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,960
Strike down Edward's enemies

472
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,560
and keep him safe in your love.

473
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,880
Lord, we pray for our father,
for success in his endeavours.

474
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,400
And that he knows what he is doing
and it is your will.

475
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,760
I pray for my husband.

476
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,240
That he comes home safe to me

477
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,800
and for the safety of my baby.

478
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,840
Bring my Lord Warwick
success against his enemies.

479
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,080
Almighty God, strike down Edward
of York in this battle.

480
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,600
Strike down this wicked usurper who
has taken the rightful king's crown.

481
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,880
Bring victory to my brother
and to Jasper Tudor,

482
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,960
who fight for you on the side
of Lancaster.

483
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,200
Please, God, let Edward win.

484
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,720
Let him live.

485
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,480
Please, God, let Edward lose.

486
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,240
Let him die.

487
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,120
Let us hope it is as easy
as they promise.

488
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,600
"Easy"?

489
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,480
Warwick and the Duke of Clarence
will turn on Edward

490
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,040
and kill him in the battle.

491
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,400
We are just here to lure him
to the field.

492
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,720
But... My sister said...

493
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,720
But why would Warwick and the Duke
of Clarence be on our side?

494
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,000
Oh, believe me, they're not!

495
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,640
They will make George the king
if all this goes well.

496
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,240
But... And if it does not...

497
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,240
..then we will all die
a traitor's death

498
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,520
and have our guts spread
outside Westminster.

499
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,200
But... I thought this was God's holy
war to return Lancaster to victory?

500
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,520
Get some sleep.

501
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,960
Your part's nearly over.

502
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,160
God is not to save me?

503
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,320
'God is not to save me?
Is not to save me...'

504
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,600
In the King's name, stop! Guards!

505
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,880
I need to see the King!

506
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,040
Please!

507
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,520
Edward! There is a plot to kill you.

508
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,840
It is Warwick
and the Duke of Clarence!

509
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,760
They mean to turn on you
in the battle.

510
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,720
Please, Edward...

511
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,040
Traitor...

512
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,680
No! No!

513
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,360
No! No, not my boy!

514
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,600
My boy is dead! Lady Beauchamp?
My boy is dead!

515
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Lady Beauchamp, I'm so sorry...
Why did he go?! Why did he go?!

516
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,000
Why did he do it? My boy is dead...

517
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,840
They failed, then?
Edward is not dead?

518
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,800
Go inside.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

519
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,120
How could God allow this?

520
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,760
Why...why...why did he...

521
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,040
Edward is safe, but it was
all a trap as I feared!

522
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,000
Warwick and George have fled and
Edward is in pursuit.

523
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,520
He knows they would
have murdered him in cold blood!

524
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,440
He murdered Welles who'd only come
to tell him of a plot against him.

525
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,040
He is no longer the Golden Boy of
York. No-one will trust him again.

526
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,600
What should he care? He should care,

527
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,040
because now the Beaufort family
is in mourning

528
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,760
for their kinsman, Welles. Edward
has given his enemies a new cause.

529
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,280
Oh, Richard! My darling boy...

530
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,520
He was a traitor. He betrayed his
House of Lancaster to Edward.

531
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,320
For goodness' sake, Margaret,
the boy is dead.

532
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,040
She does not care, she has no heart!
And she is cursed!

533
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,560
It seems to me it is YOU
who is cursed, Mother,

534
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,200
for you gave birth to a traitor.
Enough, Margaret! That is enough.

535
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,080
Jasper! Jasper's fled!

536
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,560
The King will hunt him down and kill
him, so he's fled to France.

537
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,840
We have to fetch Henry!

538
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,120
As soon as it is safe to do so.

539
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,560
No, no...
Jasper bids me fetch him now.

540
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,000
Jasper's judgment is not the best,

541
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,960
as perhaps you can now see,
since his cause is lost.

542
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,680
He's running for his life to France,
leaving little Henry
with no guardian.

543
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,480
He has no choice! He chose to fight
the King. This is the outcome.

544
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,000
I will fetch the boy.

545
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,600
I will come too.
He is my son. I am not afraid.

546
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,400
I will do as you say
if there are soldiers on the road.

547
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,000
I beg you. I beg you. Please.

548
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,600
Very well, Margaret.

549
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Perhaps now you'll understand
your mother's grief.

550
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,600
I have a pain.

551
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,560
Every time he moves or turns.

552
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,440
I cannot breathe.

553
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,960
Issy!

554
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,080
Father?!

555
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,040
We failed!

556
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,360
We did not "fail", we retreated!

557
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,760
Our error was to trust in Lancaster,
the Beaufort boy betrayed us.

558
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,240
The rightful king is George of York!

559
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,840
And we shall see him anointed
on the throne! God save King George!

560
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,000
King George!

561
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,360
Now, we'll sail to Calais
and raise an army.

562
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,320
We are at war with so-called
"King Edward".

563
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,560
Father, I cannot sail!

564
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,000
I am in my confinement...

565
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,360
Father?!

566
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,600
Warwick and George
are sailing for Calais

567
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,160
and they will bring
the English Garrison against us!

568
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,800
Anthony has ridden to try and stop
them but he may not be in time.

569
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,080
We must act, Mother. Elizabeth.

570
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,280
They killed your husband and your
son. And they have gone unpunished!

571
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,960
We were discovered!

572
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,200
Anthony Rivers rode like a madman

573
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,120
and captured
our fleet at Southampton.

574
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,760
I'll have his head for that!
We sail for Calais! Now!

575
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,880
Midnight knows
there's something wrong.

576
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,400
Don't be silly, Issy.
He's just being naughty.

577
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,120
He doesn't want to go.

578
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,680
Edward is after us! Get on board!
Issy is afraid, Father.

579
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,200
Come on!

580
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,520
See... He's on board now.

581
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,680
You can sleep and we'll be there
in no time, you'll see.

582
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,520
There's a storm brewing.

583
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,080
And if it gets any worse,
we'll have to stop.

584
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,600
Look how we have the best cabin!
We were never allowed it before.

585
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,000
The wind's picking up.

586
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,520
It's just a few big waves, Issy.

587
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,600
WAVE CRASHES, WIND HOWLS,

588
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,560
Annie, it's a storm!
We're going to die!

589
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,280
Take down the sail! Reef in!
Aye, Captain!

590
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,600
Annie! Annie!

591
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,000
Annie! The baby's coming!

592
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,240
Annie!

593
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,400
Margaret?! Margaret.

594
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,880
We must take shelter!

595
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,560
We must take shelter!

596
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,920
Mother! The baby's coming!

597
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,200
We must return to port!

598
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,760
Father says we will run
for the French shore

599
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,680
and take the shelter of the coast.

600
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,440
Get linen for her! Quickly!

601
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,280
You have to light the fire!
My sister is in labour!

602
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,960
It's a witch's wind!
We're cursed with women on board!

603
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,360
I command you to light the fire!

604
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,320
I, Anne Neville,
the Kingmaker's daughter.

605
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,160
What are you doing down here?
Has my son been born?

606
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,640
We need linen, rags! Anything!

607
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,520
And a spoon for Issy to bite on.
In the galley.

608
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,160
And give her this.
God knows she'll need it.

609
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,480
Why have we stopped?

610
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,000
We must make sure the castle
isn't taken. Wait here.

611
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,880
Hup! Hup!

612
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,320
This is too much, Elizabeth.

613
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,720
Once the magic is out,
you cannot call it back,

614
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,040
and it may turn round
and drown us too.

615
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,800
It's just the servants and the boy!

616
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,600
Welcome to Pembroke Castle, my Lady.

617
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,840
Sir.

618
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,160
Where is my Uncle Jasper?
He is with you?

619
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,680
He is safe, but he's not with us,
I'm afraid, Henry.

620
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,680
Will he be back?
I am sure of it.

621
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,160
Henry? I'm...I'm your mother,
I'm Lady Margaret.

622
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,200
I've come to take you home.
I'm safe, thank you, my Lady.

623
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,120
I'm waiting for my Uncle Jasper,
so I cannot leave.

624
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,120
I shall tell the groom
to tend to your horses.

625
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,280
He's seeing to it, so you,
you may stay inside. You...you...

626
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,640
He does not want to come.

627
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,280
He does not know me.

628
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,480
He is Jasper's boy
through and through.

629
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,640
And now, you'll make him yours.

630
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,360
Lady Mother, what is happening?
Why doesn't the baby come?

631
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,320
It's stuck inside her.
She needs a midwife to turn it.

632
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,800
Go ask your father how long
before we reach Calais!

633
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,560
Father? Isabel needs a midwife.

634
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,320
Mother asks how soon we shall be in
Calais? We're sailing into her now.

635
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,680
Isabel shall see the best
physician in France.

636
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,960
What's that noise?

637
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,160
They've raised the harbour chain!
They've stayed loyal to Edward!

638
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,960
Turn the wheel!

639
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,000
Raise the sail! Now! Do it!

640
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,960
Lady Mother, they are firing at us!

641
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,000
You will have to turn it. Annie!
You have the smallest hands. No...

642
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,160
You have to put them inside her
and try and turn the baby.

643
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,840
No, Mother, please! I cannot!

644
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,080
The child is stuck. If you love
your sister, you will do it!

645
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,960
Annie... Please, Lady Mother!
I don't want to die!

646
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,600
Annie! Ann...

647
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,760
(Jasper!)

648
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,440
Jasper!

649
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,680
I'm sorry!

650
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,280
No! No, no... It's me.

651
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm so sorry.
My brother betrayed you.

652
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,120
Margaret,

653
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,800
I have to go.

654
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,120
There is a price upon my head
and they're searching for me.

655
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,080
I will go to France,

656
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,560
but I will be back and with an army.

657
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,520
I couldn't tell our boy that
I was here in case he spoke of it,

658
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,720
but I was hiding there
in the hills, waiting for you.

659
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,920
You wanted to be sure my boy
was safe before you sailed.

660
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,280
How will I live without you?

661
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,720
May we come and watch you go?

662
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,520
It will be good for the boy
to see you safely off.

663
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,280
He is close to you.

664
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,800
It was a boy.

665
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,160
A baby boy.

666
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,400
I have to go away. You must live
with your mother now, boy.

667
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,280
You must keep her safe for me.
All right?

668
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,960
Like a Tudor, eh, Henry?

669
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,840
Like a Tudor, sir!

670
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,240
Come here, boy.

671
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,200
Henry, would you like to
pray with me?

672
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,280
We could pray for your Uncle Jasper
together? No, thank you, my Lady.

673
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,120
It's "Mother", Henry.
I'm your La...Lady Mother...

674
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,080
Edward!

675
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,560
Come.

676
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,760
You remembered!

677
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,200
Peaches and salt cod.
Back for May Day as promised.

678
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,480
And now we have our York prince,
Edward, we shall be safe.

679
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,440
I'm sorry for your loss.

680
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,480
OUR loss.

681
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,280
There will be others.

682
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,400
If we had stayed at Warwick Castle,
my baby would have lived.

683
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,760
It is your fault.
Queen Elizabeth is with child again.

684
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,320
We must have a son before she does.

685
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,160
This is NOT the end, Isabel.

686
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,480
But it is the end of my baby...

687
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,520
It is the end of him.

688
00:58:20,305 --> 00:59:20,584
