1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,050
I here present unto you, Queen
Elizabeth, your undoubted queen.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,990
I know that you do not like me
and that you plot against the king.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,760
You shall have your moment in
the light. We are close to the throne.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,560
The Bad Queen called herself
Margaret of Anjou,

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,210
and she tried to spear Father
with a roasting spit!

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,890
And her son? The prince of ice?

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,540
He cut off two men's heads
when he was only seven years old!

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,500
Jasper and I are one in all things.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,920
Not all, Margaret.
You're not married to Jasper Tudor.
You are married to me.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,560
I have to go. You must live
with your mother now, boy.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,840
You must keep her safe for me.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,880
I'm with child again
and this time, I'm SURE it's a boy.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,120
Now, we'll sail to Calais
and raise an army.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
We are at war with so-called
King Edward.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
But Father, I cannot sail!

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,560
Issy is afraid, Father.
Come on!

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,360
Warwick and George are sailing
for Calais. We must act, Mother.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,760
Annie!

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,200
It was a boy.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm sorry for your loss.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,880
It is your fault.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,440
Queen Elizabeth is with child again.

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,480
We must have a son before she does.

24
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:38,250

26
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,240
Elizabeth? What happened?

27
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,360
It is nothing...
No, leave me. Leave me, please.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,680
I said, leave me!

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,320
I'm sorry, Mother.

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
Her child.

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,400
Her poor child!

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,440
These things happen. Terrible
and tragic though it may be.

33
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,560
The baby came too soon.

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,640
And the storm could not have helped
what little chance he had.

35
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,880
Yes, but you weren't to know that
Isabel was on board that ship.

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,920
Or that Warwick would
force her to set sail.

37
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,880
He is the one who gambled
with his own grandchild's life.

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
And he lost.

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,880
Now, he has nothing.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,200
He is desperate and destitute.

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
Indeed he is.

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,680
He has never been more dangerous.

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,200
We would be fools to think
the worst is over.

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,880
Issy?

45
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,400
Ruined.

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,440
Everything's ruined!

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,160
No, it looks worse than it is.

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,400
We can manage until we return home.

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,080
Home? You think we're going back
to England? Of course.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,000
Anne, don't be such an idiot.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,480
We will never see England again.

52
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,480
We are exiles now,
like the Bad Queen.

53
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,880
We are not like her.
We are NOTHING like her.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,720
Father promised he would put
George on the throne, and he will.

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,160
And then you shall be
Queen of England.

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,000
If it weren't for
Father's plotting,

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,800
I'd be cradling my son
in my arms now.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,960
But I am all alone.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
You are not alone.

60
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,960
You have me.

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,120
And I will never leave you,
I promise.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,040
We'll always have each other.

63
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,120
Jasper was right.
You are an expert soldier.

64
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,120
He taught me well.

65
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,400
Ready, my Lord?

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,880
Yes.

67
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,680
Argh! You fool! What have you done?
I'm... I'm fine, Mother.

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,800
You're hurt! It's just a scratch,
that's all. Ready?

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,400
No-no! No more of this today.
It's bleeding. It may scar.

70
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,840
Uncle Jasper says soldiers should
wear their scars with pride.

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,760
Come, sit by me. I will tend to it.
Mother... What?

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,040
If you think me so fragile,

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,920
then perhaps it is a blessing
that I will never become king.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,240
What do you mean, you will never
become king?

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,600
You doubt your destiny?

76
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,360
What's this about, Warwick?
Where have you been?

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,240
Making arrangements.

78
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,600
What arrangements?
Are we going home, Father?

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,160
Yes. But not just yet. You are
to be married first, Anne.

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Married?

81
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,120
I was not consulted...
There wasn't enough time. To whom?

82
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
Richard?

83
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,000
My brother?

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,720
No, of course not.
Who, then?

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,320
Prince Edward of Lancaster.

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,080
The Bad Queen's son?
You mustn't say that any more.

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,560
Margaret of Anjou is our enemy.
Our greatest enemy. She hates us.

88
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,000
If this goes according to plan,
she will be your mother-in-law.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,120
I don't understand what
you're trying to do.

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
How can this possibly help us?

91
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
George, I know that
this is hard for you,

92
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,920
but we have to do
what we set out to do.

93
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,160
We came here to raise an army.

94
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,800
No, we came here to make me king!

95
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,480
I have tried it! Twice!

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,040
But now that you have lost your son,

97
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,160
you have no heir
and men will not fight for you.

98
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
They think that God
has ruled against you.

99
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,800
I lost my son because of you!

100
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,760
And if I could still make
you king, I would!

101
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,040
But it cannot be done.

102
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,160
The only way that we can raise
an army big enough

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,920
to defeat your brother Edward now
is if we join with Lancaster.

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,400
Now, I have spoken with King Louis
and he has agreed

105
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,640
he will support us if we make terms
with Margaret of Anjou.

106
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,480
Have you completely lost your mind?
Why would she make terms with us?

107
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,720
There's nothing in it for her!

108
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,840
There is. Her husband, Henry,
back on the throne of England.

109
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,000
Her son and my daughter, Anne,
to follow him when he dies.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,960
You're telling me
that everything I've done -

111
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,440
I turned against my brother,
my own House -

112
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,160
everything I've suffered has been
to restore

113
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,920
the very lunatic we started
all this to topple?!

114
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,400
It is the only way, George.
The only way to what?

115
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,320
That evil bitch
hacked my father's head off!

116
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
No, there's another way.

117
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,080
Do it if you want to, George.
But think before you do.

118
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,160
You cannot go back to England,
you have betrayed your king.

119
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,400
Kill me and you have no-one.

120
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,880
We could not make you king.
Join with me and France and Anjou

121
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,280
and I'll see to it you have
every title you can wish for.

122
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,800
And riches beyond your dreams.

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,760
It is the best that
anyone can offer you now.

124
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,960
No, it's the best
that YOU can offer me.

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,160
And Anne will be queen.

126
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,360
She'll need a new gown.

127
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,000
Margaret of Anjou has requested
I bring Anne with me to meet her.

128
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,640
Mother, you must speak to him!

129
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,120
What does this mean, Mother?
How could he do this?

130
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,600
Edward of Lancaster is a monster!
I will not marry him!

131
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,440
Anne, what we want, what we need,
is of no importance.

132
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,120
The sooner you understand that
and realise that your fate

133
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,480
will always be in the hands of
others, the better.

134
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,200
You are just one tiny piece
in a much, much bigger picture.

135
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,800
So, monster or not, you must
marry him. You heard your father.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,440
It is our only hope.

137
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,320
My Lord. Allow me.

138
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,920
Sir Henry!

139
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,960
What is it? Come in, Sir Reginald.

140
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,800
Men are inside the walls.

141
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,330
Get inside, Margaret, at once!
It's not safe here.

142
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,410
Sir William Herbert.

143
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,010
Sir Henry.

144
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,930
I demand you hand over the traitor,
Jasper Tudor, immediately.

145
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,330
He has fled, sir.
You have my word of honour.

146
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,970
Jasper Tudor is not in the castle,
nor nearby.

147
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,090
So, I'm afraid you've had a wasted
journey. No. I have not.

148
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,050
I'm sorry, Sir Henry.

149
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,410
I have been granted Pembroke
and the command of Wales. No!

150
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,450
Do not involve yourself in this,
Margaret.

151
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,130
Do not involve myself?
Pembroke Castle belongs to my son!

152
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,890
I'm afraid that is no longer
true, Lady Margaret.

153
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,690
What does it say?

154
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,090
Bray will show you to the stables.

155
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,810
Men!

156
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,610
Why are you like this?
Quiet, Margaret.

157
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,650
Do something.
For once, do something!

158
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,090
Jasper would.

159
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,530
It's not only your son
who pines for that man, I think.

160
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,850
Have the guests' rooms prepared.

161
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,530
Though I suppose WE are
the guests now.

162
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,090
My God, Anne, she's here!

163
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,010
I have always known I would see you
on your knees again, Lord Warwick.

164
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,690
Your Grace, ever since I was a boy,
I have felt

165
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,170
driven by a need to do
what is right by England...

166
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,770
Seizing my husband's throne.

167
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,650
Capturing and imprisoning him,
as though he were a criminal.

168
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,490
Driving me and my son, the future
King of England, into hiding?

169
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,570
All these things you judged to be
right for our country?

170
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,170
I have been so blind to the true
motives of those around me.

171
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,290
You're too trusting, Warwick.
I've long thought it.

172
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,450
Your Grace, I now know
what I always should have.

173
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,930
That God put Henry on the throne
and put you beside him.

174
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,330
This epiphany is certainly
conveniently timed.

175
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,530
I swear fealty...
You may remain where you are.

176
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,530
This is a fragment of
the true cross.

177
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,610
It is stained with the blood
and tears of our Lord Jesus Christ.

178
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,850
Lay your hand on it
and let me hear you swear again.

179
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,970
I, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick,

180
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,410
swear to be your loyal
and faithful servant,

181
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,330
from this day,
until the day I die.

182
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,930
I accept your service.

183
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,650
Now, let me see the girl.

184
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,010
So, you are to marry my son?

185
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,690
Come here.

186
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,890
You don't give us much to work with.
Does she, Edward?

187
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,450
She'll have to do, I suppose.

188
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,970
Turn... A plain little thing indeed.

189
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,970
She is obedient, Your Grace. Mmm.

190
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,210
Oh, well, at least
she will be easily managed.

191
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,610
Unlike the impostor queen,
Elizabeth.

192
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,250
Another troublesome woman, Warwick.
She is not a woman, she is a witch.

193
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,970
Then why is she sitting on
my throne? Not for much longer.

194
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,850
But you must send your armies
now to England.

195
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,650
Edward will soon hear of our
alliance, if he hasn't already.

196
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,730
We mustn't give him time
to prepare for attack.

197
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,490
Allow me
to make certain things clear.

198
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,410
Until this marriage takes place,
I must and will do nothing.

199
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,130
And since they are cousins, I intend
to wait for the papal dispensation.

200
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,810
That could take months.
I must sail immediately.

201
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,890
But of course you must. You must
restore my husband to the throne.

202
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,770
Alone?

203
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,050
You have just sworn allegiance to me

204
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,610
and this is your chance to prove it.

205
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,130
Go to England. Raise your army.

206
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,850
Put my husband on his throne again.

207
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,530
Be the Kingmaker once more.
And when you have done that,

208
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,450
when you have secured London,

209
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,090
I will follow to secure
the rest of the country.

210
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,730
And between us,

211
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,050
we will crush Edward for good.

212
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,970
You do believe I will keep my word,
don't you, Lord Warwick?

213
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,370
Of course.

214
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,530
Oh. Can I offer you
a word of advice?

215
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,250
To fight an infestation,
you must scorch the nest.

216
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,050
When you reach England, deal with
that impostor queen, Elizabeth.

217
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,810
If she has a son, she will
be more damaging to my cause

218
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,730
than all of Edward's armies.

219
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,370
Your Grace.

220
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,650
Edward? I'm sorry, it must wait.

221
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,850
It seems Warwick has
stumbled from his shipwreck

222
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,090
straight into the arms
of Margaret of Anjou.

223
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,890
They're planning to form
an alliance.

224
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,690
You must read this.

225
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,130
It's from my cousin in Burgundy.

226
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,330
Anne Neville is to marry
Edward of Lancaster.

227
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,250
It's true.

228
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,850
How could he think to give his own
daughter over to that monster?

229
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,810
After all that we have
endured at this woman's hand...

230
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,970
George can have nothing
to gain from this.

231
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,330
He hates me so much,
Richard, is that it?

232
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,010
That he is driven by
his hatred of me?

233
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,410
George is driven
by his own ambition and greed...

234
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,930
He would fight against me
with the very woman

235
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,530
who tore our father apart?

236
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,490
Warwick will use Anne
to bind them together.

237
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,850
Then restore Henry to the throne.

238
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,290
It was Warwick who lit a fire in me,
taught me to fight, to win,

239
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,570
to drag her down
and punish her for what she did,

240
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,930
for what she did to all of us.

241
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,210
And now he stands with her!

242
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,210
Did none of it matter?!

243
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,410
Warwick does not know loyalty
and George will soon see this.

244
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,410
George can't be pleased with
his new set of circumstances.

245
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,090
I'll wager he didn't even
see them coming... Elizabeth.

246
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,290
Margaret of Anjou and Warwick?

247
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,090
Holding one of them off is
difficult. But both, together?

248
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,850
My God...
It is a deadly alliance.

249
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,170
Then we must weaken it.

250
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,410
Your Grace.

251
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,610
I believe the Queen wishes
to speak to you alone, Duchess.

252
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,690
Then the Queen
will have a long wait.

253
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,450
It's about your son
George's betrayal.

254
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,930
You are aware that he's joined
forces with Margaret of Anjou?

255
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,090
My Lady. My Lady.

256
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,650
You may speak freely
in the presence of Lady Sutcliffe.

257
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,810
We have no secrets.

258
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,930
So, let's dispense
with the pleasantries

259
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,970
and get straight to
the purpose of your visit.

260
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,690
And this disgusting rumour that
you are spreading about my son.
It is not a rumour.

261
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,770
You've always been determined
to paint him as a villain.

262
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,850
He managed that well enough himself.

263
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,090
I know this is difficult for you to
hear, but you should understand...

264
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,530
No, YOU should understand.

265
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,250
He was barely 11 years old
when his father died

266
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,130
at the she-devil's hand.

267
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,690
Have you any idea...
Indeed we do.

268
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,490
I lost my own husband and my son

269
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,810
in a similarly brutal
and senseless manner.

270
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,690
Are we to measure our pain
against each other?

271
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,690
Are we to compete over
who suffered more?

272
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,290
We seek only to prevent further
suffering taking place.

273
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,810
We're not lying. Speak to the King,
he'll tell you himself.

274
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,930
Warwick and George plan to restore
Henry to the throne.

275
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,810
And when they are defeated,

276
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,970
Edward will be forced
to execute his own brother.

277
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,410
And George will die with
a red rose at his collar.

278
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,970
Even if Warwick were to win, George
would still gain nothing by it.

279
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,130
Warwick is to marry
his daughter, Anne,

280
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,050
to Margaret of Anjou's
son, Edward of Lancaster.

281
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,890
He will naturally inherit the crown.
George will never be king.

282
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,170
Duchess, it's all been for nothing.

283
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,650
He must feel quite lost.

284
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:56,090
And with everything that has passed,
he must feel he has no other choice.

285
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,610
But you...

286
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,690
you think he does?

287
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,850
Edward would welcome him back,
and that's the real tragedy.

288
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,450
If only George knew.

289
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,500
George!

290
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,820
The Kingmaker!

291
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,180
This is beneath you.
Get up. Get dressed.

292
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,700
You have a use for me?

293
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,540
C'est tout?

294
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,820
Laissez-nous.

295
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,020
I have only ever wanted a York king,

296
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,100
but we are out of options.

297
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,500
I need Louis to believe
that we can hold the throne.

298
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,660
Would you be disloyal to me,
as your brother has been?

299
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,020
Aren't you a better man than Edward?

300
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,260
IF you are to restore Lancaster
to the throne,

301
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,940
you will need York support to keep
it. And I am still a Son of York.

302
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,220
That is why we have to be united.

303
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,780
And keeping your wife's bed warm
would fit you better.

304
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,980
I still have need of a grandson,

305
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,300
and you, an heir.

306
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,500
We will leave in the morning.
There's no hurry - really.

307
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,780
I understand how difficult
all this must be.

308
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,380
You'll be sorry to
lose Pembroke, I'm sure.

309
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,540
It must happen. It was not my
husband's home, it was mine.

310
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,180
But the loss won't be for long.

311
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,260
The House of York are destroying
themselves

312
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,220
and they will continue to do so.
It's God's will.

313
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,980
Margaret, really.

314
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,140
I have stepped over the bodies
of dying men, as they cry out

315
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,620
for their mother, some of them not
much older than young Henry there.

316
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,780
How can that possibly be
the will of God?

317
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,620
He has set you against each other,
because you stole the throne.

318
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,420
But soon you will lose.
King Henry will be restored,

319
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,660
my son will return here,
to his castle, to his home.

320
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,100
Lady Margaret,
he will have no need to return.

321
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,220
I'm sorry?

322
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,500
Henry won't be leaving with you.

323
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,420
What did you say?

324
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,300
He has been placed
under my guardianship.

325
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,580
On whose orders?

326
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,700
I am instructed
by the House of York.

327
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
SHE ordered this?
Do you speak of the Queen?

328
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,900
I speak of that witch!

329
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,820
That is treason! I suggest you
silence your wife, Sir Henry.

330
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,260
Please, stay calm, Margaret.

331
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,060
It will be no hardship, Mother.

332
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,500
You are my son.
He will stay with me.

333
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,020
He will not. And you may blame
only yourself for that.

334
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,780
The incitement of your kinsman,
Richard Welles, in the uprising
was a grave mistake...

335
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,060
This is how I am to be punished?
..a GRAVE mistake on your part...

336
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,740
This is how I am to be
taught my lesson?

337
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,020
He is to be taken from me
as though he were a doll

338
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,540
and I were a little girl?

339
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,220
He is my son.

340
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,380
HE IS MY SON!

341
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,620
No, Mother! Mother, that's enough!

342
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,820
Surely, sir,
this is a little extreme.

343
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,860
I am under orders.
It has been decided.

344
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,780
Your wife has been deemed
a traitor to the King of England.

345
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,340
Of course she cannot raise
her son in her own belief.

346
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,820
There will be no change of heart
on the matter. I assure you.

347
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,780
Lady Isabel, Lady Anne.

348
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,340
You have a visitor.

349
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,780
Lady Sutcliffe!

350
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,500
Please, do not call out.
I only wish to speak with you.

351
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,860
Why? What do you want?

352
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,340
I have a message for your husband,
Lady Isabel.

353
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,180
I cannot go to him,
it is too dangerous.

354
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,020
Please, I can't stay long.
Permit me to speak with you.

355
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,980
You may speak with us both.

356
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,300
I have come at the request of your
mother-in-law, the Duchess Cecily.

357
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,380
You have nothing to fear.

358
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,100
The Duchess simply
would like George to know

359
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,540
that should he wish to return
to England, he can.

360
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,780
His brother, King Edward,
will gladly receive him

361
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,220
and will restore him to favour.

362
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,140
Come home?

363
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,020
Yes. It is good news, is it not?

364
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,420
The Duchess also asked me
to tell you

365
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,140
that she grieved the loss
of her poor grandson.

366
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,420
She was appalled
to hear of your ordeal.

367
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,260
You should be at home now,
surrounded by your friends

368
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,420
and those who love you.

369
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,540
I would like to go home.

370
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,820
You can't, Issy. You know you can't.

371
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,860
I must leave. You will pass
this message to your husband?

372
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,420
Do you think George will accept?
He wouldn't.

373
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,540
But if he does and your marriage
to Edward of Lancaster goes ahead,

374
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,180
then we will be
on opposing sides, Anne.

375
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,860
I cannot bear to leave you.

376
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,620
And I shall be sorry
to see you go, Mother.

377
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,780
I will look after him,
Lady Margaret.

378
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,780
My own boy, Thomas,
is just two years younger.

379
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,620
I'm sure they'll be great friends.

380
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,700
I promise I will treat your son
as though he were my own.

381
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,820
You are nobody's son but mine.

382
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,700
Remember who you are.
You are with the enemy now.

383
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,220
Bend the knee,
but think always of the sword.

384
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,580
God will protect you,
because you are Henry Tudor

385
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,220
and one day,
you will be King of England.

386
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,900
Thomas is your age...

387
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,140
I'll send for you
as soon as it's safe.

388
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,220
My Lord. Let us pray Anjou
does not play you false.

389
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,860
Do you doubt me, George?

390
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,780
We are sailing and she is not.
The risk seems all ours.

391
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,500
Reaching England before Edward
turns the whole country against us

392
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,260
is in everyone's interest. This
is your cause now. Perhaps.

393
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,340
But as you are so fond of reminding
me, I have no choice, Warwick.

394
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,700
Goodbye, Husband.

395
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,900
We must pray that your wedding
takes place quickly.

396
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,460
Play your part, Anne. Please
your husband and your new queen.

397
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,020
Yes, Father.

398
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,420
And Warwick has sailed?
You're sure?

399
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,740
We believe he will
land in the North soon.

400
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,580
It may only be a matter of days.

401
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,980
I have ordered Richard's army to
meet me outside London immediately.

402
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,020
I am told Margaret of Anjou
plans to follow Warwick

403
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,100
and land in the South. If that is
the case, I must act quickly.

404
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,460
I must crush Warwick in the North,
then turn back to defend London.

405
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,060
Told by whom?

406
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,860
I have had word from George.

407
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,180
He says that he will land
with Warwick's invading army.

408
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,540
But as soon as we face
each other in battle,

409
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,180
he will abandon Warwick, and fight
by my side. Do you believe him?

410
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,740
I don't know.

411
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,660
But God, I want to -
he's still my brother, Elizabeth.

412
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,900
Take the girls to
the royal rooms in the Tower.

413
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,220
Prepare for the baby there.

414
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,580
Go to the Tower, Elizabeth.

415
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,460
I will come to you as soon I can.

416
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,860
When?

417
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,420
When I have won.

418
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,780
Your Grace.

419
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,860
Nothing from Henry, Margaret.

420
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,900
He's been experiencing
a lot lately. He'll be...

421
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,180
busy with more important matters.

422
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,260
Adjusting.

423
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,260
I now spend my days waiting
for a letter from my own son.

424
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,420
When I was a girl, I thought
I was destined for greatness...

425
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,460
What type of greatness?

426
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,700
Sainthood.

427
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,980
I wanted to join a convent,
and then become a saint.

428
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,940
You know it was
the other way round for me.

429
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,420
My father wanted me to
join the church.

430
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,900
I wasn't very keen. So, er...
I told him I was possessed.

431
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,220
You wanted to be a saint,
I wanted to be a sinner.

432
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,660
What is it?

433
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,140
Do you think...

434
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,060
even if we avoid sin ourselves,

435
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,380
that we are punished
for the sins of others?

436
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,540
For the sins of our parents?

437
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,620
Well, if we are, Henry is safe.

438
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,980
You are the most pious woman
I have ever known.

439
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,260
I am not speaking of Henry.

440
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,060
Then who?

441
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,460
My father committed a great sin.

442
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,820
He thought he could play God.

443
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,980
He hanged himself.

444
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,820
And you think you'll be
punished for that?

445
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,180
I already have been.

446
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,500
I've had my son taken away from me.

447
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,820
God is not punishing you
for his sins.

448
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,300
I wish I could believe that.

449
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,620
Oh, Margaret!

450
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,020
We don't need to
wait for a letter from Henry.

451
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,540
I will take you to him.

452
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,420
What are you doing?

453
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,860
She has been sent for.

454
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,380
You are leaving for England?

455
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,620
Tonight.

456
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,060
But my wedding.

457
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,620
I need Issy with me.

458
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,820
Your father wants Isabel
close to George.

459
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,500
He doesn't trust him.

460
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,740
I am to be his spy.

461
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,340
No! You cannot take Issy away.
We can't be parted.

462
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,500
I can't do this without her!

463
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,220
Please, Mother!
We need to make this work, Anne.

464
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,540
We must do as your father says.
Mother, I beg you...

465
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,220
Do you think I married for love?

466
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,180
No, it was an agreement,
a contract... just like this.

467
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,020
And I was very scared too, Anne.

468
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,660
I was terrified.

469
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,620
But I knew it was my duty.

470
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,620
And I knew it would make my family,
the people I loved, happy.

471
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,900
It was my purpose.

472
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,300
And now, it is your purpose.

473
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,660
You will grow to like him.

474
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,540
And one day he'll be the king.
Remember that, it will help.

475
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,500
Halt!

476
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:27,700
Henry. Henry! Mother?
Lord Stafford, Lady Margaret.

477
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,580
Where are you taking him?
Warwick has sailed for England.

478
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,700
I have been ordered to join
King Edward's army,

479
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,900
and march north, where
we will fend off the attack.

480
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,180
Henry cannot fight for York.

481
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,020
I have been instructed to take
him with me. You cannot do this.

482
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,180
Sir William is his guardian now.
He must be obeyed.

483
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,420
I'm sorry, Lady Margaret.

484
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,060
No, please. Please,
Sir William, you don't understand.

485
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,740
He is Henry Tudor.
He cannot fight for York.

486
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,740
It is against God's will,
it will make him angry!

487
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,340
You will make God angry!
We must go. We must go.

488
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,660
For your own sake, don't do this!
Goodbye, Mother.

489
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,860
I am being punished!

490
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,660
I am.

491
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,620
Who's there? It's us, Mother.
It's Thomas and Richard.

492
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,500
My boys! Oh!

493
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,260
Where's my husband?

494
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,660
He's safe, Mother.

495
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,700
Something's wrong.

496
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,260
Warwick did not land in the north
as the King had thought.

497
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,100
We were barely outside London
when he took us by surprise.

498
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,540
The King escaped to Flanders
with his brother Richard
and Uncle Anthony.

499
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,940
My God. What of George?
Did he rejoin Edward?

500
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,540
We weren't ready to fight.

501
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,020
We had to flee so quickly
that there was no battle.

502
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,540
We still don't know where
George's loyalties lie.

503
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,660
Is Edward still king?

504
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,580
And I'm no longer... queen?

505
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,820
We will not be protected.

506
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,100
We are in great danger.

507
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,500
I must send to Grafton
for my mother at once.

508
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,620
What is it? What have you heard?

509
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,900
Warwick has already ordered
our lady grandmother's arrest.

510
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,740
His men came to Grafton,
and took her away.

511
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,260
Arrested?

512
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,940
On what charge?

513
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,020
Witchcraft.

514
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,980
No.

515
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,940
No...

516
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,980
Yes?

517
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,660
You sent for me, Your Grace?

518
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,260
Your father has landed in England...

519
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,740
and Edward has fled.

520
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,500
My Henry will be king again.

521
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,260
Good news at last. Yes.

522
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,940
And the dispensation has come.

523
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,420
You are to be married immediately.

524
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,100
Now, it all begins.

525
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,780
Anne Neville.

526
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,140
Isn't it extraordinary?

527
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,300
Once you were
my greatest enemy's daughter...

528
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,900
and now you are to marry my son.

529
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,780
Jacquetta was right,

530
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,260
fortune's wheel
will never stop turning.

531
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,780
Quickly, boys. Mother! Mother!
He will come for me now.

532
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,980
What's happening, Mother?
I am certain of it.
We don't have much time.

533
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,580
Richard. Mother!

534
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,900
The imposter, Edward, has fled.

535
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,940
Open your gates,
in the name of King Henry.

536
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,740
Mother, he is already here.

537
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,420
Sh-sh-sh!

538
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,500
Come on.

539
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,100
This way, quickly.

540
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,260
Come on. Sssh.

541
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,660
This way, Your Grace. I'll have
the gate opened. Thank you.

542
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,540
I will not forget this.
My God, hurry.

543
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,860
Hurry, please.

544
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,740
Come.

545
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,900
Where is she?

546
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,460
They've gone to seek sanctuary.

547
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,180
Westminster Abbey's her only hope.

548
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,700
She has no friends.
No-one to protect her.

549
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,300
Then she's safe, is she not?

550
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,660
Or would you break sanctuary
as easily as you break
your word, Warwick?

551
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,860
She's safe.

552
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,860
As long as she stays there.

553
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,980
And none of this has been easy.

554
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,660
My Lords, welcome.

555
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,380
I've called this court

556
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,500
because I seek to prove

557
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,860
that the marriage of King Edward
of York to Queen Elizabeth

558
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,940
was an unlawful one.

559
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,540
I seek to prove it was not, in fact,
a marriage, but an enchantment...

560
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,740
brought about by sorcery
and witchcraft,

561
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,100
practised by this woman.

562
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,580
The Queen's own mother.

563
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,180
This man, my Lords,
is Mr James Friars.

564
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,980
Mr Friars, how do you know
the woman on trial today?

565
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,020
I was good friends with her son,
Anthony Rivers.

566
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,300
I've never seen this man
before in my life.

567
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,820
And you've been to
her house at Grafton? Many times.

568
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,180
And were you there the week after

569
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,980
her secret wedding,
to Edward of York.

570
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,340
I was.

571
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,540
Can you tell us what you found on
the grounds at Grafton that day?

572
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,420
When I was leaving,
when I was mounting my horse,

573
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,420
I noticed that he, the horse, was
kicking at something in the dirt.

574
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,260
So I had a look and found there was
something buried there. What?

575
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,180
Two dolls. They were very small.

576
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,620
Made of lead.

577
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,900
One was a woman, the other a man.

578
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,180
And they were bound up with wire.
This is what you found.

579
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,780
That's right.

580
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,500
Two figures, made of lead,

581
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,380
bound, in devilish union, with wire.

582
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,660
Do you deny it?

583
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,620
Of course I do.

584
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,180
Thank you, sir.

585
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,940
If a witch is capable of
the darkest and most evil deeds.

586
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,340
If a witch will do anything
to see their own needs met,

587
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,180
regardless of the pain and suffering
that they cause others.

588
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,820
Then, indeed, there is a witch
in this room, Lord Warwick.

589
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,700
But it is not me.

590
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,780
This is your only defence?

591
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,260
I would also like to call a witness
to attest to my character.

592
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,780
Their name?

593
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,460
Margaret of Anjou.

594
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,980
Your anointed queen.

595
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,420
What did you say?

596
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,820
I think you heard me.

597
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,100
I escorted Margaret to England for
her wedding when she was just 15.

598
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,900
I carried her train
at her coronation.

599
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,380
I was by her side
when she gave birth to her son.

600
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,940
I was her dearest friend.

601
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,620
If any harm comes to me,

602
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,260
it will be your head
she spikes on the city walls.

603
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,300
I can promise you that.

604
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,980
In nomine Patri, et Filio
et Spiritui Sancto.

605
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,180
Sicut erat in principio,

606
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,540
et nunc et semper
et in saecula saeculorum.

607
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,300
Husband! Quickly!
Come and see who is here!

608
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,540
Henry?

609
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,580
What happened?

610
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,620
I've been travelling for days.

611
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,900
Tell him.

612
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,980
When Sir William and I met
the York army outside London,

613
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,340
Warwick had already ambushed them.

614
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,380
Edward was forced to flee.
Where is Sir William now?

615
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:23,620
Warwick's men they...
they dragged him from his horse,

616
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,620
and then he,
Warwick himself appeared...

617
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,980
as if from nowhere.

618
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,100
They held Sir William down, one of
them was gripping his head tightly.

619
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,980
He begged and he pleaded,

620
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,020
but they did not listen

621
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,980
and then Warwick raised his sword.

622
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,660
Oh, my God. They took hold of me.
I was certain I would be next.

623
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,620
As they dragged me towards Warwick,

624
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:01,140
his bloody sword,
I found myself crying out...

625
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,340
"I am Henry Tudor!

626
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,020
"I am Henry Tudor!"

627
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,780
Warwick immediately
lowered his weapon,

628
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,660
and told them to release me.

629
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,100
Your name saved you.

630
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,580
Your name.

631
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,180
Yes.

632
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,300
Yes, you were right.

633
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,820
I am Henry Tudor,

634
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,580
heir to the Lancastrian throne.

635
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,380
And one day
I WILL be King of England.

636
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,820
I'm so sorry I ever doubted you,
Mother.

637
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,380
I promise you I never will again.

638
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,740
And from this day...

639
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,140
I will obey you always.

640
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,180
I wouldn't worry -

641
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,620
There isn't much to hide.

642
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,140
You must lie on this.

643
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,180
Up.

644
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,260
Up, up, up.

645
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,580
I must know that
it has been consummated.

646
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,580
You will bleed.

647
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,220
Goodnight, my son.

648
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,780
Goodnight, Lady Mother.

649
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,380
I don't know what to do.

650
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,580
Nobody told me.

651
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,240
You don't do anything.

652
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,760
You just lie there.

653
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:46,030
In fact, I think it's best you don't say anything that will remind me...

654
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,380
of who... you... are.

655
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,190
I can't stand the thought of it.

656
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,440
Pedes eorum lavisti...

657
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,280
ac dulciter eos consolando,

658
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,560
Imminentem Passionem praedixisti.

659
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,640
You have nothing to fear.

660
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,400
We've come to restore you
to your rightful place.

661
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,840
God save you, King Henry.

662
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,560
Come here, you. Let me look at you.

663
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,480
What have you done, eh?

664
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,470
God save the King.

665
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:33,110
God save King Henry.

666
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:37,230
Oh! Oooh!

667
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,430
Mother?

668
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,310
Oh, God, no. Not yet.

669
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,830
Thomas, you must go and find
someone to fetch a midwife.

670
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,470
Bring her immediately.

671
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,950
You must be pleased, Warwick.

672
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:00,670
I am. Everything's gone according
to plan, as I said it would.

673
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,190
Apart from the fact that
Margaret hasn't sailed

674
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,230
and that Edward is still out there.

675
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:10,750
Does that not trouble you, Warwick?

676
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,390
What should I do, Mother?
Tell me what to do.

677
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,670
Don't cry... Grab her.

678
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,350
Lady Margaret.

679
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,150
Would you like to meet the King?

680
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,070
Who is that?

681
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,870
Richard, careful.

682
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,510
Grandmother.
Where is she?

683
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:29,310
Mother... I'm here, I'm here.
Don't worry, I'm here.

684
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,110
It's all right.

685
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:33,990
God save the King!

686
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,150
Why did he let you go?

687
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:45,950
Fear that Margaret of Anjou
would take his life if he took mine.

688
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:48,830
Ahhhh. It's coming,
but it's too soon.

689
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,590
Oh, shhh, shhh. Oh shhh.

690
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,190
Your Grace.

691
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,150
It's too soon, Mother!

692
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,590
No, it isn't.

693
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,710
Allow me to introduce my son,
Henry Tudor.

694
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:22,870
You are ready. It's the right time,
you are ready, so is the child.

695
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,410
It's a boy!

696
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,740
It's a boy.

697
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,160
You have a son. A York prince.

698
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,220
There. Come on. Come on.

699
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,500
There we are.

699
00:57:24,305 --> 00:58:24,356
