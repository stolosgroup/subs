00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,566
how are you gonna do it?

485
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,221
Guy like Harrington,

486
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,963
you follow the money.

487
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,576
So it really makes
perfect sense.

488
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,448
As we revamp
the existing structure,

489
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:18,233
it'll attract more businesses
like Starbucks and Jamba Juice,

490
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,756
while beautifying
the neighborhood.

491
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,106
WOMAN:
You mean change
the neighborhood

492
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,891
so that other
people can move in.

493
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,719
You want to turn
Crown Heights into SoHo.

494
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,764
[crowd murmurs agreement]
CRYSTAL:
We won't be able

495
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,810
to afford the higher rents.

496
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:32,813
We want to make Crown Heights
better for us,

497
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,510
not move us out.

498
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,120
WOMAN: Tell them, Crystal.

499
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,663
Well, that's-that's why we're
here... to get this feedback.

500
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:40,124
We can figure out a plan
that works for everybody.

501
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,343
You care so much

502
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,127
that you have us come down here

503
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:44,694
instead of coming
to the neighborhood?

504
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:46,237
Oh, no, no, that-that
wasn't our intention.

505
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:47,828
Are you intentionally
sabotaging us,

506
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:50,352
or are you just stupid?

507
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,615
[people murmuring]

508
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,791
Don't you want to get rid
of the gangs?

509
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,316
The drugs? The violence?

510
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,796
We make this a more
beautiful place,

511
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,798
we can do just that.

512
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,800
Malcolm King, one of your own,

513
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:06,629
was struck down in his prime

514
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:09,719
by the very gang that's plaguing
your neighborhood.

515
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:12,331
Malcolm cared about
this neighborhood, and so do I,

516
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,334
which is why my vision
will help everyone.

517
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:17,161
If you supported Malcolm King,

518
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,163
you should be supporting
Robert Harrington.

519
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:24,255
The audacity. To murder
Malcolm and come up in here

520
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,083
and throw it up in
these people's faces.

521
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,477
You were right.

522
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,131
I checked out King
and his family.

523
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:33,003
New car in the driveway,
flat-screens being delivered.

524
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:34,831
Money's flowing.

525
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,399
But without a warrant, I can't
prove where it's coming from.

526
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,358
Yeah, let me take care of that.

527
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,272
Why should we trust you?

528
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,753
My power went out
for the third time in two weeks

529
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,320
during my son's
asthma treatment.

530
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,758
Ma'am, I feel your pain,

531
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:53,328
I do, but I don't control
the utility companies.

532
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,243
I mean, maybe I should.

533
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,637
Or maybe he does.

534
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:05,514
Aunt Vi, I took your advice,
sort of.

535
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:08,256
I tweeted about my accident
and got over 2,000 retweets.

536
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,389
-In one day?
-Yup. I mean,
before I could respond,

537
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,434
I got a DM from the city manager

538
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,957
for a meeting tomorrow
to discuss it.

539
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,437
A DM is a direct message.

540
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:18,048
Girl, I know what a DM is.
Congratulations.

541
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,442
I wish we had Twitter
back in the day.

542
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,922
I can't wait to tell Mom.

543
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:23,967
I'm gonna go pick out
something to wear.

544
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,447
Mmm. [laughs]

545
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:32,889
Hey. You know how, uh, octopuses
have a bunch of tentacles?

546
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:35,414
Well, uh, Harrington's
the kraken of octopuses.

547
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:38,242
Wait a minute.
Is it octopuses or octopi?

548
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,549
- Did you connect him or not?
- I think it's octopi.

549
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,571
Anyway, Harrington's got
his tentacles in everything.

550
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:43,726
Arms, Harry.

551
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,293
Octopuses have arms.

552
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:47,948
Really? Oh, great.
Way to wreck my flow.

553
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,950
- My bad. Please continue.
- Ah, it's fine.

554
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,734
Moment's gone.
Anyway, you were right.

555
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,083
The, uh, power outages

556
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:55,434
traced back
to a Gas and Electric supervisor

557
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,913
who was paid from a shell corp,

558
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:58,935
the same shell corp that
Kenya's family was paid from.

559
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,918
Well, can you connect it
to Harrington?

560
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:03,485
No, but I can connect it to a...

561
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:05,400
a Bahrain-Hawala
money transfer system

562
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,117
that's located where
Harrington just happens

563
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:08,751
to be developing property.

564
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:11,885
Why would Harrington be
funneling money to a Hawala?

565
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:13,471
You might want to ask
your old employers,

566
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,366
because this one
just happens to be

567
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,846
on a CIA watchlist
for funding...

568
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,152
Terrorism.

569
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,849
Well, that's not a good look.

570
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:23,070
Remind me, Harry, people tend
to frown on that, don't they?

571
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,332
Only the good ones.

572
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,942
So, if an upstanding citizen

573
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,857
like Robert Harrington
was exposed

574
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,686
for sponsoring terrorists,

575
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,167
ooh, think what
the press would say.

576
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,666
That could take down
his entire empire.

577
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,431
Yeah, right, except

578
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,651
I can't find any incriminating
files in his system.

579
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:41,523
Every dictator we took down
with the CIA kept

580
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,482
some record
of their dirty deals.

581
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,048
Harrington is no different.

582
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:46,972
He's just going
through extra effort to hide it.

583
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:50,706
We find those files,
we got the proof.

584
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,188
Doesn't matter. Even if
it did connect to Harrington,

585
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,451
I couldn't take it to the D.A.
if I wanted to

586
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,671
because you obtained it
illegally.

587
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,237
ROBYN: Well, forget the D.A.

588
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,543
We're gonna do this my way.

589
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:03,502
If we can't get him
on Malcolm's murder,

590
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:04,981
maybe we can get him on this.

591
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:07,201
[phone beeping]

592
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,162
Oh.

593
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,340
Bishop takes queen.

594
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:17,777
- Checkmate.
- Yeah, I know.

595
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,518
Thanks. I was only waiting
the whole game

596
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,823
to make that move myself.

597
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,216
Sorry.

598
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,653
[scoffs]
Hey, forget these board games.

599
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,699
How would you like
to take out a real king?

600
00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:37,492
I get it. Guy tries to make a
difference, some jerk kills him.

601
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,582
Now you want revenge.

602
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,453
But it's a dangerous game.

603
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:45,108
Harrington is in business
with some bad people.

604
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:46,632
He's in bed with terrorists.

605
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:48,938
Prophets of Honor, to be exact.

606
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,550
Responsible for the Paris bombing

607
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:52,855
last year.

608
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,465
He's funding them?

609
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,511
Well, he doesn't
support their cause,

610
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,470
but he pays them a premium
for building permits in Bahrain.

611
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:02,299
The P.O.H. turns around,
takes that money

612
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:03,866
and buys weapons.

613
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,435
So he's building his empire
on blood money.

614
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,219
And let me guess.

615
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:11,134
His dealings help The Company,

616
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:13,180
so they just turn a blind eye.

617
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:16,575
Why is this so important to you?

618
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,969
You don't even know
this Malcolm guy.

619
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:21,536
You remember Zurich?

620
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,451
Well, how could I forget?

621
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,061
We barely made
the extraction point.

622
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:28,499
Somebody I know wanted to go
back for the ambassador's son.

623
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,197
Well, he would've got killed
if we didn't.

624
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,286
I didn't know him, either,

625
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,636
but it was the right thing
to do.

626
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,726
I used to think you were
a sucker for doing that.

627
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,468
Well, who was the bigger
sucker for going with me?

628
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,993
All right, listen.

629
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:46,735
If we're gonna do this,
we got to do it quietly.

630
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,346
You still own a tux?

631
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,697
Yeah. Oh, yes, I own a tux.

632
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,394
You got an inside man?

633
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:55,526
I have someone in mind.

634
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,704
BISHOP: <i>
Harrington's son. Ambitious.</i>

635
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:01,010
ROBYN: <i>I've seen their dynamic.</i>

636
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:04,187
He's looking for a door. He
just doesn't know there is one.

637
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,885
First, I'll earn his trust.

638
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:07,234
Edwin, right?

639
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:11,151
I thought I recognized
you from the plaza.

640
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:12,587
Tracy Carter.

641
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,545

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,942
Come on.

966
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,465
Now, you have to admit,

967
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,989
it was kind of fun
playing outside the lines.

968
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:32,299
Playing outside the lines
or crossing the line?

969
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:35,389
Whatever gets the job done.

970
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,485
[exhales]

971
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,794
Oh, come on.

972
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:51,492
You're not still upset, are you?

973
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:54,626
Hey, if we're not failing,
we're not trying, right?

974
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:56,323
[chuckles softly]
Yeah, I'm gonna need you

975
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:57,716
to upgrade your pep talk game.

976
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:59,195
[chuckles]

977
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,980
How 'bout this?

978
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:03,417
Every now and then in life,

979
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,159
you're gonna hit a brick wall.

980
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:08,727
It's how you respond
that matters.

981
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:12,295
So what they won't fix it.

982
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:15,821
Don't let that
take your power away.

983
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:18,040
You know, sometimes,
if you want things done,

984
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:19,433
you got to do it yourself.

985
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,871
VI:
Are y'all coming,
or am I gonna have to

986
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:25,700
fill this pothole by myself?

987
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:31,271
You knew city hall wasn't gonna
fix this, didn't you?

988
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:33,491
I was just prepared
in case they didn't.

989
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:36,972
Thanks.

990
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:38,713
I'll go get my coat.

991
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:40,715
You do that. Let's go.

992
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:44,545
Thanks, Aunt Vi.

993
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:47,026
[chuckles]

994
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:49,507
Oh, and, uh,

995
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,987
my father had a whelk shell
from Jamaica, not a conch.

996
00:41:52,031 --> 00:41:53,249
Come on, babe!

997
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,642
I knew you remembered.

998
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,557
- All right.
- You're shoveling.

999
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,752
- I'm shoveling? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1000
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:59,125
You wanted a job, right?

1001
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:01,519
I'll take the pictures.

1002
