1
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,464
Previously on The Equalizer

2
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:15,034
I mean, who do you go to
if you can't go to the cops?

3
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,342
We've gotten dozens of hits
off that message you sent out.

4
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:21,040
What are you doing? I'm
using my powers for good.

5
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,389
He's gonna be heavily guarded.

6
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,608
Well, then, I'm
gonna need backup.

7
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:24,783
Trouble's my specialty.

8
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:26,113
Yes, it is.

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,788
Looks like you made some improvements
with the place. What do you need?

10
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,008
I need those freaky-ass
superpowers of yours.

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,879
Detective Marcus Dante.
Have you guys ever

12
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:36,447
come across this woman as
a part of your investigation?

13
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:38,275
The facial rec
turned up negative.

14
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,841
They said it's like
she doesn't exist.

15
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:41,476
Except she does.

17
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:32,570
Tommy, open up.
It's Dale. I made it.

18
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:38,576
Tommy?

19
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,934
Tommy? Tommy!

20
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:57,029
No.

21
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,368
Stop. I can walk from here.

22
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:14,501
What, you don't want me to
pump up my old-school joints?

23
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,068
Hey!

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,557
Hey, Jazzy. Mom.

25
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,343
I haven't seen
Jasmine in some time.

26
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:31,910
Any reason for that?

27
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,936
No. Just been busy. See you.

28
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:42,181
Yeah?

29
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,443
Morning, sunshine. Bad time?

30
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:44,575
No, I'm good. What's up?

31
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,011
There's some lawyer

32
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,796
putting the word out to
the "got a problem" person.

33
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,276
He sounds pretty desperate.

34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,452
We got to find something
better to call me than that.

35
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,174
Go ahead and set up the meet.

36
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,536
So the rumors are
true... you really do exist.

37
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:10,905
I've heard rumors, too.

38
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:13,125
Nic Palermo. Public defender.

39
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:15,606
Used to be a pretty good
lawyer until you hit the bottle.

40
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,043
Yeah, well, I'm
not here about me.

41
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,827
It's about an old client.

42
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,394
Dale Aldridge.

43
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:24,378
The murderer that just escaped
Danford a few days back?

44
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,660
I don't help criminals.

45
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:27,685
Please.

46
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,341
He's innocent.

47
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:37,105
His case nearly broke me.

48
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,717
I spent ten years
trying to show folks

49
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:43,329
that what happened to Dale
was a gross miscarriage of justice.

50
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:46,071
But everywhere I turned,
there were brick walls.

51
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,247
It wears on a man.

52
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,162
He's out of appeals now,

53
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:52,077
but he's still trying to
prove that he didn't do it.

54
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:54,732
And if the cops find him,
they'll probably kill him.

55
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:58,344
He deserves better,
better than I could do.

56
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:01,565
Look, if you don't believe
me, just take a look at the case.

57
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:04,026
There's something off about it.

58
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,441
Okay, I'll look at the case,

59
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,704
but I need to meet
him face-to-face.

60
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:13,229
He called me from a burner.
I don't know where he is.

61
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,535
Let me handle that.

62
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,233
Tommy Venti. Parolee.

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,322
Released from prison
four months ago.

64
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,324
U.S. Marshals found the body

65
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,326
when they were tracking
down that escapee,

66
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,718
Dale Aldridge.

67
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:26,154
Smart money's on a prison beef.

68
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:27,852
He and Aldridge were cellies.

69
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:30,071
This is Deputy U.S.
Marshal Mike Monroe.

70
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:32,422
He's leading the
fugitive task force.

71
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:34,491
Detective Marcus Dante.

72
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,078
Not much for you, Detective.

73
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,906
Neighbor saw Aldridge
fleeing the scene.

74
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,257
Pretty cut-and-dry. Except
this was more than a prison beef.

75
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,694
These marks... this
was an interrogation.

76
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,696
Someone wanted information.

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,524
Or just wanted to make it last.

78
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:50,178
If Dale Aldridge is settling
scores, this won't be

79
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:52,640
the only homicide
you're following down.

80
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:04,671
Easy, Dale. Easy,
Dale. I'm not a cop.

81
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,394
Your lawyer Nic, he
sent me to help you.

82
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,764
How'd you find me?

83
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,766
Tracked your burner phone.

84
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,987
What are you,
some kind of a P.I.?

85
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,753
No. I'm more of a specialist.

86
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,862
Your lawyer says you're
trying to clear your name.

87
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,148
How you planning on doing that?

88
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,217
There's this guy named Preacher,

89
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:31,263
and my last cellmate,
Tommy, did time with him

90
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,265
a couple of years back upstate.

91
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,180
Overheard him confess

92
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,399
to the murder I'm in for.

93
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,183
When Tommy got out,
he tracked him down.

94
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,880
We were gonna
confront him, but...

95
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:41,926
Preacher, he got to Tommy first.

96
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,647
Beat him to death.

97
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,017
So that was your plan,

98
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,019
force a confession
out of a killer?

99
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:50,238
Even if you did,
you're out of appeals.

100
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,328
You wouldn't even
get a new trial.

101
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,677
I don't care about a trial.

102
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,616
The only thing I
care about is him.

103
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,336
That's my son, Blake.

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,163
He thinks he's the
son of a murderer.

105
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,035
His mother says
he's self-destructing,

106
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,341
going down the wrong path.

107
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,431
If I can just show him
I'm not who they say I am,

108
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,805
maybe he won't think
that's who he is, either.

109
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:13,982
I just want him
to have a chance.

110
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:19,529
Okay, so, where
is this Preacher?

111
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:21,226
That's just it.
Tommy wouldn't say,

112
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,489
'cause everything's
recorded on prison phones.

113
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,491
Preacher, that's
just a nickname.

114
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:27,275
I don't even know his real name.

115
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:28,799
Well, let me worry about that.

116
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,540
But it might take a minute.

117
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,783
I can put you up in a
safe house for a few days.

118
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:36,197
I can keep myself
safe. Cops consider you

119
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:37,242
armed and dangerous.

120
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,461
They will shoot to kill.

121
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,027
I appreciate the help.

122
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,184
Would you trust
anyone if you were me?

123
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,468
Well, okay.

124
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,774
But use this phone.

125
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,297
No one can track it but me.

126
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,299
Keep it on. Lose the other.

127
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:53,301
And don't even think about
trying to contact your family.

128
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,477
Cops will be on 'em.

129
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,043
In the meantime,

130
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,243
I'll try to locate Preacher.

131
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,224
I remember this case.

132
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,139
They called it "Terror
in Great Neck."

133
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:08,012
The guy would cut alarms and
break in when no one was home.

134
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:11,145
Except for the last
time someone was.

135
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,712
Carol Walton,

136
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,975
an ER nurse... she was
found stabbed to death.

137
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,063
A neighbor said they saw Dale

138
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,630
hanging around
her house that night.

139
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:18,892
Sounds suspicious.

140
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,503
Well, until you find
out that he was working

141
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:21,939
as a handyman at
the house next door.

142
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:24,724
So based on the
testimony of one person,

143
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,073
Dale got sentenced to life.

144
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:27,248
There had to be other evidence.

145
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,555
I mean, DNA or a murder weapon.

146
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,601
Not according to
his lawyer's files.

147
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,906
And he had no record.

148
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,604
Prosecution used
the fact that he was

149
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,475
working-class and
struggling, trying to provide

150
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,521
for his family as motive.
It's hard to imagine

151
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,305
being locked up for
something that you didn't do,

152
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,089
and then watching, helpless,

153
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,135
as your kid goes
down the wrong road.

154
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,353
Got him.

155
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,921
No thanks to the
Department of Corrections.

156
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,575
Their I.T. system's
a pit of idiocy.

157
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,795
Reginald Floyd, aka Preacher.

158
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,145
Did a nickel at
Fishkill for B and E.

159
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,755
Shared a block with
Tommy for two of them.

160
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,235
Look at this.

161
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,977
What? Apparently,
he got a traffic ticket.

162
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,588
Rolling through a
stop sign in Great Neck.

163
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,460
Date on the ticket?

164
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,896
June 11.

165
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,855
Same night as one
of the first burglaries.

166
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,272
That's our guy.
How do I find him?

167
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:13,773
- It looks like he's in Queens.
- Apparently found God

168
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:15,253
on the inside...
he's got some kind

169
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:16,733
of inner-city, ministry now.

170
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:19,910
Then he should know all
about the power of confession.

171
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:22,782
Yo. Rob, hey.

172
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,305
Just watch your back out there.

173
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,655
That, that cop

174
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,526
that's been looking for
you, Marcus Dante, he's on

175
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,110
the task force that's
hunting Aldridge.

176
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,773
Then I'll keep my eyes open.

177
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,023
If you have to carry the sheep,

178
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:49,766
that means not only was it
far away, it was wounded.

179
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,159
The enemy kidnapped your dreams,

180
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:55,467
kidnapped your hopes,

181
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:58,339
kidnapped your future,
and tried to kill you

182
00:08:58,363 --> 00:08:59,602
in the process.

183
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,647
You were down, and
you were bleeding.

184
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,107
But you survived.

185
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,261
Is there... Are there any
survivors in the church today?

186
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,611
Are there any survivors online?

187
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:11,507
Make a sound if
you're a survivor.

188
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,326
Ooh, you got a pretty good swing

189
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,980
for a man of God.

190
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,243
What?

191
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,593
What do you want from me?

192
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:35,812
The truth.

193
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:38,273
'Cause, Preacher,
today is judgment day.

194
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,214
I know what you're thinking...
I'm a killer... but you're wrong.

195
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,565
Says the man who tried
to grand-slam my head.

196
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,044
You broke into my house.

197
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,611
I heard someone
from my prison days

198
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,570
was looking to get even,
then you showed up.

199
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,701
Looking for answers,

200
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:58,486
about Great Neck, the
Carol Walton murder.

201
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,966
Tommy Venti heard you confess.

202
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,340
Then he starts asking
questions and ends up dead.

203
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,473
Tommy's dead?

204
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,541
I did confess

205
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,325
to the burglaries.

206
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:12,892
But I ain't never killed nobody.

207
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,981
You expect me to believe that?

208
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,940
When Carol Walton was murdered

209
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,812
by someone using the exact
same M.O. as those robberies?

210
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,161
I'm a man of God now.

211
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:23,686
I confessed my sins,
and I'm telling you,

212
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,426
murder wasn't one of them.

213
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,559
So, what?

214
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,169
This just a coincidence?

215
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,694
No. It's the same M.O.,

216
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,521
'cause whoever killed that woman

217
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:36,287
used my crime to get
away with their own.

218
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,527
When the cops picked
me up on another charge,

219
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:42,052
I was terrified they were
gonna pin that murder on me,

220
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,097
until they arrested
that other guy, Dale.

221
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:45,446
After that, I thanked God

222
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,926
every day.

223
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,233
I changed my life.

224
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:51,322
I promised I'd do his work.

225
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:55,239
By letting an innocent
man take the fall?

226
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,545
You could've come
forward. And said what?

227
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,852
"I did the robberies
but not the murder"?

228
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,506
Black man, white woman?

229
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,769
It don't matter if I
had a rock-solid alibi.

230
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,815
I'd never see daylight again.

231
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,688
Okay, so you had
an alibi for then.

232
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,125
What about last night
when Tommy was killed?

233
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,214
I was ministering
in a soup kitchen.

234
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,869
I ain't never kill nobody.

235
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,785
Not then, not now.

236
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:22,658
Somebody used my crimes
to get away with murder,

237
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,050
and now they're
trying to make sure

238
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:25,314
that their secret stays buried.

239
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,754
And we've got officers
posted there as well.

240
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:33,649
Well, that's good to know.

241
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,803
Well, if it isn't
Detective Dante.

242
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,327
District Attorney Grafton.
Didn't want to interrupt.

243
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,765
I was hoping for a
moment with Judge Cooley

244
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,245
about Dale Aldridge's case.
You were the prosecutor?

245
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,421
We were just discussing
security measures.

246
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,075
And since he's
all out of appeals,

247
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,598
he's got nothing to lose.

248
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,818
I, on the other
hand, have a family.

249
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,646
I've reviewed his
phone calls from prison.

250
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,170
So far, he hasn't made any
direct threats against you

251
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:58,781
or anyone else
involved in the case.

252
00:11:58,805 --> 00:11:59,999
Hardly a comfort,

253
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,435
given he murdered a woman

254
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,916
in cold blood and just
killed his old cellmate.

255
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,789
I understand. It's just...

256
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,442
What?

257
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:11,794
Also in those calls, Dale
and Tommy spoke about

258
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,621
finding the real killer.

259
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,493
Sounded like Dale was
looking to clear his name.

260
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,321
I hate to ask, but...

261
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,105
Detective... No.

262
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,411
It's fine.

263
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:22,152
It was a big case, Detective.

264
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,285
Lots of media attention.
So yes, we looked.

265
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:27,766
I can assure you,
there was no evidence

266
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,638
it was anyone other
than Dale Aldridge.

267
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:31,857
Your Honor, we're ready.

268
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,772
I'm due back in court.

269
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:36,930
You have any other
questions, please call.

270
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,039
Did you really just
accuse the judge

271
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,779
of putting away the wrong guy?

272
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,563
I'm a cop, not a lawyer.

273
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:45,175
Meaning? Not every
question is an accusation.

274
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,829
My job is to make sure
the story fits the facts.

275
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:49,657
By all accounts, Dale
and Tommy were friends.

276
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,703
Doesn't make
sense he'd kill him.

277
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,661
And when I pulled surveillance,

278
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:56,099
I saw a stolen car
leaving Tommy's place.

279
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:58,188
The man in it wasn't Aldridge.

280
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:01,017
Detective, we have an escaped
killer running around my city.

281
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,194
If you want to chase ghosts,
how about you do it after he's back

282
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,829
behind bars and before
another body drops?

283
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,986
- But it has to be him.
- He confessed.

284
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,728
To the break-ins,
not the murders.

285
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,209
I checked Preacher's
alibi from ten years ago

286
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,688
and the night Tommy was killed.

287
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,889
It's not him.

288
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:27,521
So, what? This
was all pointless?

289
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:30,611
No. It means the real
killer is still out there.

290
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,222
We just need to find 'em.

291
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,877
How? Th-There's
no place to start.

292
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,052
We start with the victim.

293
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:39,098
Carol Walton. Someone
wanted her dead.

294
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,013
We just need to find out who.

295
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,885
After a decade?

296
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,625
You really think
that's possible?

297
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,845
Well, the killer
seemed to think so.

298
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,891
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have moved on Tommy.

299
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:51,067
Which also means
you're not safe.

300
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:52,764
Not here or back there.

301
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,834
You need to let me protect you.

302
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,377
No.

303
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,597
I'm tired of putting my
life in other people's hands.

304
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,781
I'll figure it out on my own.

305
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:04,321
Dale.

306
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,432
You know that
phone you gave him?

307
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,260
It's in a Jersey landfill.

308
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:12,479
He's clearly not that into you.

309
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:15,439
Well, can you blame him?

310
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:16,875
Ten years of fighting,

311
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,835
and his one shot ends
with his friend being dead.

312
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,532
I think he's losing hope.

313
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,229
So, what are we supposed to do?

314
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:26,082
If someone doesn't want
our help, do we just stop?

315
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,234
We help him anyway.

316
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,714
I mean,

317
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,716
we're not getting paid
to do any of this, right?

318
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,849
We're making a choice
to help people who need it.

319
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,415
I mean, clearly,
this dude needs it.

320
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,069
He's out there, he's alone.

321
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,704
So we help him before
he gets himself killed.

322
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,885
Hey.

323
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,428
What's that for?

324
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,474
It's for you being you.

325
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:52,345
Thanks.

326
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,241
You're welcome.

327
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:56,872
So what's our next move?

328
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,310
Well, Carol's body was found
by her friend Elaine Gibson,

329
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,964
so maybe she can shed some light

330
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:04,270
on what was going
on in her life back then.

331
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:06,359
In the meantime, we
got to find Dale again.

332
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:09,145
And see if you can
get eyes on his family.

333
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:11,998
I got a feeling he's gonna
do something stupid.

334
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,024
You're still duct-taping
the door handle.

335
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:40,524
You shouldn't be here.

336
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:42,178
How's Blake?

337
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:44,615
Tell me.

338
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,443
I've tried, Dale. I have.

339
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:48,793
He's just so angry
about everything.

340
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,316
He hasn't been home for weeks.

341
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,386
Your last letter, you
said he was in trouble.

342
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,104
You remember Bobby Crenshaw?

343
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,932
Yeah.

344
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,175
Blake is jacking
cars for him now.

345
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,327
I have to see him.

346
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,633
Promise you won't. The cops...

347
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:03,895
You should get going
before the Marshals

348
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,331
waiting outside get suspicious.

349
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:06,550
Promise me.

350
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:08,030
I can't lose you both.

351
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:11,927
Hey, promise me you'll
get the handle fixed, okay?

352
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,930
I love you.

353
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:28,224
Excuse me. I need
to see Elaine Gibson.

354
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,015
Totally! That call cost
them the touchdown.

355
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,278
I know! Pass interference, bro.

356
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:41,802
Hey. You mind using
your inside voice?

357
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,066
You see that family?
They're grieving.

358
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,198
I'm the head of
emergency surgery.

359
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:50,009
Then it would be a real shame
if you couldn't use your hands.

360
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,496
Hi. I'm Elaine.
You looking for me?

361
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,127
Carol was more than a friend.

362
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:05,024
She was like a sister. We
even got matching tattoos.

363
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,133
It never sat right,

364
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:10,788
what they said happened.

365
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:13,399
I know it's been a minute,
but can you think of anyone

366
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:14,879
that would want
to come after her?

367
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,098
Bad relationship?

368
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,013
Money problems? Anything?

369
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,537
No, nothing like that. I mean

370
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:22,998
she was a crusader. How so?

371
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,979
Back then, the opioid
wave was just hitting.

372
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,068
In the ER, we saw
the damage firsthand.

373
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,158
Someone was flooding the
streets with prescriptions.

374
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,160
Carol wanted to find out who.

375
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:38,772
The night she died, she
said she'd gotten a name.

376
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,383
Some guy running a pill mill.

377
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,211
She just needed verification.

378
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,735
The next morning, she was dead.

379
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,303
Did you tell this to the police?

380
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,174
Yeah, I did. They
said they'd look into it,

381
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:50,349
but then they caught that guy.

382
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:52,699
Said the evidence
was overwhelming.

383
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,725
You know, what else
was I supposed to do?

384
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:00,707
Dale's lawyer never saw.

385
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,058
Elaine's statement
about another suspect.

386
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,364
Someone buried it? Yeah.

387
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:06,670
And they were
willing to drop bodies

388
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:08,150
to keep the truth
from coming out.

389
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,021
Well, I think I might know who.

390
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,197
You know your buddy at
the NYPD, Detective Dante?

391
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:13,633
While everyone's been,

392
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:14,939
running around
searching for Dale,

393
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,419
this dude's been quietly
swimming upstream.

394
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:17,550
Check this out.

395
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,335
He pulled these off the cameras

396
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,076
in front of Tommy's
apartment the night that Dale

397
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,251
supposedly killed him.

398
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,861
It's a guy in a car.

399
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,036
It's not just any car.

400
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,472
That's a stolen car
right there, man.

401
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:29,388
That was, that was reported
stolen earlier that day.

402
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,086
You know, and what a
coincidence, some guy's

403
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,304
roaming around in
a stolen car in front

404
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:33,392
of Tommy's apartment
the night he's murdered.

405
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,394
Yeah, that's
definitely not Dale.

406
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,918
Well, the bad news is, is
that photo is way too grainy

407
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,529
for the NYPD to run facial rec,

408
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,357
so your boy Dante's
gonna be at a dead end.

409
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:43,620
So what's the good news?
Well, the good news is

410
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:45,361
I may be able to, run it through

411
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:47,189
a little NSA software
to clean it up.

412
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,712
But it's gonna take me a minute.

413
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,583
Well, I got to pick up
Delilah from school,

414
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,194
so just let me
know what you find.

415
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,761
Yep. You want to watch, honey?

416
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,787
You're adorable.

417
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,597
Hey, Robyn.

418
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,904
How you been? Hey, Angela.

419
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:09,515
I saw your Jazzy yesterday.

420
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,604
Heard she saw you, too.Yeah.

421
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,171
I don't like to ask,
but did you notice

422
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,825
some weirdness
between our girls?

423
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:18,437
Yeah, I noticed they
completely ignored each other.

424
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,047
Any idea what that's about?

425
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,224
Jasmine hardly tells
me anything anymore.

426
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,356
Right now, I'm just
her Uber and her ATM.

427
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,229
You and me both.

428
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,232
Hey, why don't we just do
one of our old movie nights?

429
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,755
All four of us. Saturday.

430
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,757
Maybe we can mend
whatever the hell this is.

431
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:35,019
I'll bring the popcorn.

432
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,543
I will bring the M&M's,
"Me and Merlot."

433
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,723
Hey. What were you and
Jazzy's mom talking about?

434
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:46,204
We were just thinking
how fun it would be

435
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,815
if the four of us hung
out again, you know?

436
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,122
Watched a movie, snuggled
up under the blankets.

437
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,515
Like we used to.

438
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,170
Tell me you did not just
create a play date for me.

439
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,520
What is wrong
with a little hang?

440
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:59,478
Hang? I mean, what's
wrong is you didn't ask me.

441
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:00,653
This is Jazzy
we're talking about.

442
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:01,828
Okay, tell you what, you want to

443
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,003
hang out with Jasmine so bad,

444
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,049
you can go without me.

445
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,093
Delilah, where are you going?

446
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:08,183
To find another ride home.

447
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,991
Delilah, come back here.

448
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,678
Delilah, I understand
you are upset,

449
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:27,941
but I will not tolerate you
slamming a door on me.

450
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:29,334
Do you understand?

451
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:31,293
Fine, but you shouldn't have
done what you did, either.

452
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:35,103
Maybe I would understand
better if you tell me what's up.

453
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,824
Do you promise not to
judge me or try to fix it?

454
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,956
You might as well ask
your mama for a pony.

455
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,699
Okay, we just aren't interested
in the same things anymore.

456
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,135
Like what things?

457
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,050
I don't know, she thinks
she's all crazy woke.

458
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,618
I mean, all Jazz and her
new friends do is go to rallies

459
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,054
and make protest posters.

460
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,318
And what is wrong with that?

461
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:59,321
Life is about more than
just parties and clothes, Dee.

462
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,497
And there it is. Thank you
for the life lesson, Mom.

463
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:03,760
Hey, those things are important.

464
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:05,283
Yes, that's the problem.

465
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,676
They don't care
about the causes.

466
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,851
It's all about their Instas.

467
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,722
I mean, she's just
in it for the likes.

468
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,246
If you're gonna do
something, believe in it.

469
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,770
Isn't that what you
taught me, Mom?

470
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,554
Well, have you
tried to talk to her?

471
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:17,730
Tell her how you
feel? Okay, what?

472
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:20,385
So she can act mad
salty with her new friends?

473
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:21,908
But y'all been friends
since you were little.

474
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,519
It's not like we
fought or anything.

475
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,303
Okay? She changed. I changed.

476
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,547
It's not a thing.
There's nothing to fix.

477
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,273
Maybe I should just call Angela.

478
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,579
Tell her what? Her
daughter's fake woke?

479
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,278
Come on, Aunt Vi.

480
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,322
They've been like sisters.

481
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,671
You don't just toss that away.

482
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:47,194
I mean, even during the divorce,

483
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:50,787
it was Jazzy and Dee, Angela
and me doing everything.

484
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:56,053
So, who are you really
trying to fix this for?

485
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,082
Hey, so, we I.D.'d the guy

486
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:06,953
in the stolen car
outside Tommy's.

487
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:09,216
His name is Trent Sawyer.

488
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,307
Grand theft, assault,
some drug convictions.

489
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,960
Reminds me of my prom date.

490
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,335
Would make sense he's involved.

491
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,488
Except Trent is 23.

492
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,141
Which means when
Carol was murdered,

493
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,969
he was 13 and
living in another state.

494
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,971
So, how's he
connected to all of this?

495
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,625
That's exactly the
question we were asking.

496
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,347
Then we saw this.

497
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,419
So, what are you thinking?

498
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,899
I'm thinking we make a trade.

499
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:40,987
With who?

500
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:43,100
That cop. Detective Dante.

501
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:46,732
Our info for their
info on Dale's case.

502
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,081
You're gonna set a trade

503
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,431
with the guy who's hunting you?

504
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:50,823
Why don't you just,
like, throw rocks

505
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:52,347
at a wasps' nest
while you're at it?

506
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,696
He will make the trade.

507
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,914
How do you know?

508
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,002
Because I know him.

509
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:58,353
Career law enforcement.

510
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,267
His father was a cop, too.

511
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,270
A legend who got
busted for being dirty,

512
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:05,838
which means he has
to do things cleaner

513
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:07,840
and better than anyone else.

514
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:10,103
Wow, stalker much?

515
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:11,409
Know thy enemy.

516
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,758
Okay, so he's a Boy Scout.

517
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:14,891
Who's atoning for
sins that aren't even his.

518
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:17,067
Yet he almost tanked
his career going after

519
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:19,548
an ADA who put
politics before justice.

520
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,332
The man cares.

521
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,334
I can work with that.

522
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:26,685
Okay, who's to say, though,
he doesn't draw you in,

523
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,537
and then arrest you
when your guard is down?

524
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,603
My guard is never down.

525
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,172
Detective Dante.

526
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:36,806
Do you know who this is?

527
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:39,481
Why don't you tell me?

528
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,898
I'm that photograph
you have in front of you.

529
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:47,097
You know who I
am, so who are you?

530
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:50,230
Let's just say, when the
scales of justice are rigged,

531
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:52,189
I serve as an equalizer.

532
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,191
You mean "lawless vigilante."

533
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,714
Then I guess
you're not interested

534
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,827
in this information I
have on the Aldridge case.

535
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,415
What information is that?

536
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,633
The guy you're looking for.

537
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:02,982
The guy in the stolen car

538
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:04,462
in front of Tommy Venti's house.

539
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,116
How do you know?

540
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,117
Tell you what.

541
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:09,685
I'll give you his name

542
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:12,407
for some information from
Carol Walton's case file.

543
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:15,430
Why would I agree to that?

544
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,760
Because we both
know Dale's innocent.

545
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,435
All right, I'll play.

546
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,958
You first.

547
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:23,786
Your man's name is Trent Sawyer.

548
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,441
And up until a few days ago,

549
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,573
he was awaiting
trial on a murder two.

550
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:30,270
Says it was dismissed.

551
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:31,620
Technicality.

552
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:32,949
Look who dismissed it.

553
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,582
Judge Felicia Cooley.

554
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:39,628
Who just happened to
be the original prosecutor

555
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:41,368
on Dale's case.

556
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:43,632
So, Cooley
dismisses the charges,

557
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:47,287
Sawyer goes to
Tommy's house, and...

558
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,333
And Tommy ends up dead.

559
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:53,772
Now, that's either the world's
biggest coincidence, or...

560
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,687
Or Cooley's involved.

561
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:57,602
You mentioned Carol
Walton's case file.

562
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,343
What information do you want?

563
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,736
Walton's friend, Elaine Gibson.

564
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,868
She gave a
statement to detectives

565
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:05,001
about a possible
motive for murder,

566
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,568
unrelated to Dale.

567
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,483
Dale's public
defender never saw it.

568
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,919
You want to know who buried it.

569
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,467
Well, you can pull
the physical file.

570
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,055
If I do find something, how
do I get in touch with you?

571
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,188
Don't worry.

572
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:19,909
I'll find you.

573
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,525
You like that he's
looking for you.

574
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:31,767
Any luck finding Dale?

575
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,662
No. Nothing.

576
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,690
Blake.

577
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:43,716
You don't have to do this.

578
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:46,172
Yeah, says the convict

579
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,000
with every cop in the
city looking for him.

580
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:51,506
Says your father, who loves you.

581
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,180
Yeah, well

582
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,858
that's your problem.

583
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,663
You know there's
a reward for you?

584
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:00,665
All right, one call and
you're back in prison.

585
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:02,537
Okay, 15 minutes.

586
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,060
That's... that's all I ask.

587
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,955
Just give me 15 minutes.

588
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,963
Fine.

589
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:17,943
Detective Dante.

590
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:19,142
You got something for me?

591
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,295
You were right.

592
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,733
Elaine's statement was
definitely suppressed.

593
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:26,604
I spoke to one of
the cops on the case

594
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,040
who remembers
taking her statement

595
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:31,043
and turning it over to the
D.A. at the time... Cooley.

596
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,436
And she buried it?

597
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,090
That wasn't the only thing.

598
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,135
There's a key witness
statement that's referenced

599
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,397
in one of the files.

600
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,485
And it's missing, too.

601
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:39,661
Any idea what was in it?

602
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,097
No.

603
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,012
And the detective who
filed it retired years ago.

604
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,666
I've e-mailed Pension
for a forwarding address,

605
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,170
but that'll take few days.

606
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,578
Give me the
name. I'll find them.

607
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:53,457
Why should I trust you?

608
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,241
Because we're
running out of time.

609
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:56,765
We got him. Let's go!

610
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,984
Name's Gail Montgomery.

611
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,706
But it may be too late.

612
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:03,336
What's happening, Harry?

613
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,145
It's Dale. They found him.

614
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,954
The day you were born...
The moment I laid eyes you

615
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,695
I wanted to give you the world.

616
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:17,220
Then after the arrest,
all those appeals,

617
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:20,049
I did everything I
could to get back to you.

618
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:22,704
But you didn't.And it killed me.

619
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:25,576
Y-Y-Your visits
were what I lived for.

620
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,211
Then your mother said
you refused to come.

621
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:33,062
Do you have any
idea what it's like

622
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:34,541
when your father's a murderer?

623
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:35,934
How other kids look at you?

624
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,936
I mean, half of
them scared of me,

625
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,721
the other half showing
how tough they are

626
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,200
by wailing on me.

627
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,593
That's what you gave me.

628
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:44,073
Blake

629
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:46,423
I swear to you I didn't
do those robberies,

630
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,033
and I did not kill that woman.

631
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:49,861
That's not who I am.

632
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,298
And this... this stealing,
that's not who you are.

633
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:53,865
How would you know who I am?

634
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,301
Look, I'm gonna figure this out.

635
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:56,651
Okay? I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

636
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,131
All right, nobody
believes you, Dad.

637
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,046
Why should I?

638
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:09,707
Don't move!

639
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,864
What did you do, Blake?

640
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:15,060
What did you do?

641
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:17,323
Show me your hands!

642
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:18,847
Like you wanted. Do it now!

643
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:21,177
Get your hands up! Put
'em up where I can see 'em!

644
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,291
Hey, if you don't
believe anything,

645
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,727
you believe this

646
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,318
I love you.

647
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,374
What is it?

648
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:48,920
Nothing.

649
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,641
Just thought I saw something.

650
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,892
They're gonna
arraign Dale tomorrow.

651
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,589
For the prison break
and Tommy's murder.

652
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:07,591
He wants to plead guilty.

653
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:09,854
But he risked everything.
We can't let him.

654
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:11,377
I mean, we're not done.

655
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,944
He's done.

656
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,033
His own kid turned him in.

657
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:17,209
He's got nothing
left to fight for.

658
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,409
You tried.

659
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,021
We all did.

660
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:31,006
What was that about?

661
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,747
Dale's throwing in the towel.

662
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,226
And you?

663
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,575
Well, the clock's ticking,

664
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,055
but the buzzer
hasn't sounded yet.

665
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,362
Good, 'cause I tracked
down the detective

666
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:41,190
who took the missing
witness statement.

667
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:42,887
The night of the
murder, a neighbor saw

668
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:44,584
a man leaving Carol
Walton's house.

669
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,238
Cops matched the
neighbor's description

670
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:47,718
to a colleague of Walton's.

671
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:49,024
Someone from the hospital?

672
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:50,590
Yeah, someone from the ER,

673
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,549
but the prosecutor
deemed it irrelevant

674
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:54,203
'cause they already
had Dale in custody.

675
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,422
Deemed it irrelevant,

676
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:58,468
and then made the
statement disappear.

677
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:00,426
Did the detective happen
to remember who it was?

678
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,168
No, just that he
was an ER surgeon...

679
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:05,562
Young, brash and
a piece of work.

680
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:08,217
So, I looked up
the hospital records,

681
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:09,522
and there were
only three surgeons

682
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:10,785
working the ER back then.

683
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,743
Two were in their 50s.

684
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,397
And one

685
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:17,095
was this guy... Conner Geraghty.

686
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,818
We've already met.

687
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,972
I told you, it's a
waste of my time.

688
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:25,649
Give it to the new guy.

689
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,595
Yeah, Harry, what'd you find?

690
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:40,075
Dr. Conner Geraghty.

691
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,946
Guy's squeaky clean
until you dig deep enough.

692
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,948
Or you meet the guy.

693
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,471
Yeah, at the time
of Carol's murder,

694
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:47,952
he was the registered
owner of three LLCs...

695
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:50,302
Companies describing
themselves as community clinics.

696
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,130
Well, somehow I don't see him

697
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,480
as the "caring about
the community" kind.

698
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:55,960
Yeah, but what if
there was money in it?

699
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:57,832
Carol was looking into
opioids flooding the streets.

700
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,268
So those clinics were

701
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,791
pill mills.

702
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,706
Charging addicts for scripts.

703
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,925
Using multiple shell companies

704
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,143
so none of the
pharmacies would trip to it.

705
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,276
Nothing but a drug
dealer in a lab coat.

706
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,147
Yeah, and then after the murder,

707
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:10,888
suddenly he shuts 'em all
down, still has enough dough

708
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,281
to pay off a quarter
of a million dollars

709
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,413
in student loans, all
on a resident's salary?

710
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:16,502
Carol was gonna expose him.

711
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,722
He would lose his
license, face some jail time.

712
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:19,766
It all fits.

713
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,767
Except for Cooley.

714
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,204
I mean, I don't get it.

715
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:24,317
Why would she go out
of her way to protect him?

716
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,645
I think I just found out why.

717
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,632
Hey! What are you
doing in my office?

718
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,680
Hey!

719
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,882
So, Geraghty and
Cooley knew each other.

720
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,796
He's friends with her son.

721
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,450
It looks like they graduated

722
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,191
to murder.

723
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:54,671
Yeah.

724
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:57,979
So, an ambitious prosecutor
suppresses evidence

725
00:31:58,003 --> 00:31:59,763
in a high-profile case

726
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:01,939
to help her best friend's son

727
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,810
slip a murder rap,

728
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,030
all the while making
her own career.

729
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:08,990
Now, if that ain't the American
dream, I don't know what is.

730
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:11,340
So she spun Dale
into the better story.

731
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:13,995
A working stiff terrorizing
a wealthy neighborhood.

732
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,214
Now they need to make
sure the story sticks.

733
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,347
Well, fantastic theory.

734
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,262
High fives all around.

735
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:21,698
But we can't prove any of it.

736
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:23,395
Which means we can't save Dale.

737
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,484
Well, I think we can.

738
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:27,206
With a little inside help.

739
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:30,054
You can't be serious.

740
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:31,795
Are you serious?

741
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,057
Do you know what
you're asking here?

742
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:35,364
I'd have to bring in the D.A.

743
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,582
So bring in the D.A.

744
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:37,801
Tell her what?

745
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:39,150
To trust the word
of a vigilante?

746
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:40,717
She'd sooner have you arrested.

747
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:42,762
You seem like a man
who wants justice,

748
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:44,373
real justice.

749
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:46,201
It's why you didn't
go after me today.

750
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:48,943
Because you know
Dale is innocent.

751
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:53,058
So what are you willing
to risk to make this right?

752
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,259
Tell me, Detective, in
your wildest dreams,

753
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,044
how did you expect
that this would go?

754
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,045
I know how it sounds.

755
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,220
Do you?

756
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:07,004
Because it sounds like

757
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,180
you want me to take down
a state judge on your say-so.

758
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,182
It could blow up in my face.

759
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,184
And even if it
didn't, it would look

760
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,100
like I was big-game hunting
to help my electoral chances.

761
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:17,972
I wasn't really thinking
about the election.

762
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,061
I was thinking about
an innocent man

763
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,453
that deserves to be free.

764
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:23,194
I was thinking I
want to sleep tonight.

765
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,805
And I won't be able to, knowing
I didn't do everything I could.

766
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:27,111
Will you?

767
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:28,460
You have no proof.

768
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,288
Which is why I need you.

769
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:31,637
You couldn't have known,

770
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:32,987
but you do now.

771
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,467
And it's our duty to
do something about it.

772
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,643
So what are you willing to risk,

773
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,669
Madam D.A., for
what you believe in?

774
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,435
If I do this, I'm going
to need to know

775
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:48,069
where you're getting
your information.

776
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:03,258
I don't think I can do this.

777
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:05,584
Yes, you can.

778
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:08,326
Holding Dale's life
in my hands again,

779
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,936
after all these years?

780
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,373
Look.

781
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:13,679
I know the system let you down.

782
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,618
But this is your
chance to make it right.

783
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,946
Haven't worn this
suit in about five years.

784
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,122
How do I look?

785
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,974
Like one hell of a lawyer.

786
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:46,147
Dante.

787
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:48,062
We good? Not sure.

788
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,280
Grafton said she was in.

789
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:50,281
But I've been
calling all morning,

790
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:51,456
and I haven't heard back.

791
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,979
This doesn't work without her.

792
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:54,024
I did what I could,

793
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:55,634
but we may be on our own.

794
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:57,158
Well, if that's true,

795
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:59,682
I just sent Dale's
lawyer into a slaughter.

796
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:00,900
People v. Dale Aldridge.

797
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:02,598
I see counsel are here

798
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:04,121
and have entered
it into the record.

799
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:06,906
Dale Aldridge faces one count

800
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,213
of escape in the first
degree, one count of murder...

801
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:11,128
Your Honor?

802
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,043
I have a motion.

803
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,045
Mr. Palermo, this
is an arraignment.

804
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,916
I'll set a motions date.

805
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,964
I'm moving for your
immediate recusal, Your Honor.

806
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:22,879
On what grounds?

807
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,185
Bias.

808
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:25,577
You were the prosecutor

809
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:28,232
when my, um, client
was initially convicted.

810
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:30,234
Motion denied.

811
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:31,912
I also have.

812
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,111
I have information

813
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,590
that suggests

814
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:40,288
you failed to disclose

815
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:41,898
exculpatory evidence

816
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,639
to the defense

817
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:45,075
during the murder
trial of my client.

818
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,163
Is this true? Denied.

819
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,122
Sit down, Mr. Palermo.

820
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,253
Which is a Brady violation.

821
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:51,647
Prima facie evidence

822
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:52,778
of prosecutorial misconduct.

823
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:53,953
I also have evidence that

824
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:55,955
I'm not going to tell you again.

825
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:57,851
Well, then I'll tell you.

826
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,222
You must recuse yourself
because you are involved

827
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,789
in an ongoing
criminal conspiracy.

828
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:07,184
You actively engaged in a
cover-up for the real killer

829
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,490
in the case against my client.

830
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:10,013
Bailiff!

831
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:12,407
Clear the courtroom, now.

832
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,650
Approach the bench, Mr. Palermo.

833
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:20,241
How dare you come
into my courtroom

834
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:23,157
and level such
outrageous accusations?

835
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,549
I'm citing you for contempt

836
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,247
and moving for your disbarment.

837
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:28,838
I think that would be unwise.

838
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:33,582
Detective Dante,
you should stay.

839
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,735
D.A. Grafton?

840
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:39,173
What are you... Thanks
to Mr. Palermo's efforts,

841
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,739
new facts have come to light.

842
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:43,786
Like a witness statement
that you failed to disclose,

843
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,570
placing an
acquaintance of yours,

844
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:47,224
Dr. Conner Geraghty,

845
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,357
at the victim's house
just prior to her murder.

846
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:50,967
There is no such statement.

847
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,838
That's because you destroyed it.

848
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,492
Along with a statement
from the victim's friend

849
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,451
that went to motive

850
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,366
and would've helped the defense.

851
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,759
You're citing documents
that don't exist.

852
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,588
The documents may no longer
exist, but the witnesses do.

853
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:06,548
Which is why, when you
learned that Aldridge had escaped

854
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:09,246
and was working with Tommy
Venti to find the real killer,

855
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,900
you dismissed charges

856
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:12,336
against a street thug
named Trent Sawyer

857
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,295
and sent him to kill
Tommy and the defendant.

858
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:16,775
No. No, I...

859
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,429
We just took
Sawyer into custody.

860
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:19,802
It's why I was running late.

861
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:24,348
So what story

862
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:26,069
do you think he's gonna tell?

863
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:29,527
Now, the way I see it,
you have two options.

864
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,269
Face the media
circus of a trial,

865
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,924
or flip on Geraghty

866
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,882
in exchange for a
reduced sentence

867
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:38,319
and we do this quietly.

868
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,321
After all,

869
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,651
you have a family to protect.

870
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:51,506
I... I didn't know
Geraghty was involved.

871
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,073
Not at first.

872
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:56,554
When I put it together,
he threatened me.

873
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:58,252
Threatened you how?

874
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,732
One night at dinner with my son,

875
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,734
Geraghty heard me talking
about the string of burglaries.

876
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:04,649
How we couldn't find the guy.

877
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,825
He was fascinated.

878
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,392
Kept asking questions.

879
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,264
And you divulged
privileged facts

880
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,787
only the real
burglar would know.

881
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,441
Facts he used to
stage the crime scene.

882
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,791
He threatened to implicate me.

883
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,271
And when Aldridge escaped,

884
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,861
Geraghty called me again.

885
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,492
Sawyer was just supposed to

886
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:23,407
talk to Venti.

887
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:26,018
I never imagined
he would kill him.

888
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,238
I never wanted
that. How could you?

889
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:29,848
This is my life.

890
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,372
No, you wanted

891
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:35,114
a prestigious career, and
you knowingly sacrificed

892
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,377
an innocent man for it.

893
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:37,378
Bailiff,

894
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:39,534
take the judge into custody.

895
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:52,088
My handwriting is fine.
Get some freaking glasses.

896
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:54,090
Dr. Geraghty?

897
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:55,526
You're under arrest
for the murders

898
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,528
of Carol Walton
and Thomas Venti.

899
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:59,400
You have the right
to remain silent.

900
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:01,532
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

901
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,534
in a court of law.

902
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:05,057
Justice may be
delayed or deferred,

903
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,537
but we must never give up hope.

904
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,191
My client didn't.

905
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:10,541
And today, he walks free,

906
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,588
an innocent man, having
been given a full pardon.

907
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:17,374
All right, thank you, everybody.

908
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:18,506
Thank you very much.

909
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,551
Congratulations, Detective.

910
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:22,205
Had my doubts about you.

911
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:25,904
If I start pulling punches
because the target's too big,

912
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,428
I'm in the wrong line of work.

913
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:28,864
I still wonder, though,

914
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:30,953
how you managed to unravel

915
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:33,651
a decade-old conspiracy
single-handedly.

916
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,610
Like I said,

917
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,679
good old-fashioned police work.

918
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:40,987
And a good lawyer.

919
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,772
That must be it.

920
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:09,494
Blake?

921
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:12,429
I...

922
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:18,435
Why would he want to
see me, after what I did?

923
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,350
He broke out of prison for you.

924
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:22,245
He'll never stop
believing in you.

925
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,946
Maybe it's time
you believe in him.

926
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:12,731
I called Angela. I told
her movie night is off.

927
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:19,061
I overstepped.

928
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:20,715
And I'm sorry.

929
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,195
You know, I just... I
miss us hanging out.

930
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:26,372
You know, you and Jazzy,
and all your crazy dance moves.

931
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,723
Hey, I miss her, too.

932
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:30,681
Not her now, but us then.

933
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,553
I think we just held
onto our friendship

934
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,555
longer than we should have.

935
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,537
Well, you never know.

936
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:39,647
Hey, why don't we
do movie night tonight?

937
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:40,735
Yeah?

938
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:41,823
Just us.

939
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:43,520
Popcorn and M&M's?

940
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:44,695
Girl, you already know.

941
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,131
I'm in.

942
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:48,046
But I have an essay to
finish, so give me an hour?

943
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,265
Perfect.

944
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:51,030
'Cause I got one
more errand to run.

945
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:54,424
I love you, baby. I love you.

946
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:58,056
Give me an A!

947
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,580
Trust me, I got it.

948
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:10,615
You're a good man,
Detective Dante.

949
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:16,621
Opinions vary.

950
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,556
Tell me, what's more fun?

951
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,167
Working with me
or chasing after me?

952
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:23,734
We're working together now?

953
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:25,997
Well, we did just set
an innocent man free.

954
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:28,304
Doesn't mean I
approve of your methods.

955
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:29,610
How many laws did you break

956
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:30,959
to get the information
you needed?

957
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:33,289
About as many as y'all
did putting him away.

958
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,921
This equalizing you're doing

959
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:38,575
if you don't stop,

960
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,862
I have to come after you.

961
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,301
I'd be disappointed
if you didn't.

962
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,132
Night, Detective.

963
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,591
Catch you later.
