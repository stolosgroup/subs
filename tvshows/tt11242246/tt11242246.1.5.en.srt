needs a consult

after 9:00 at night?

7

Why do I have a feeling
this is not a social call?

But I can.

26
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,625
One shot. If I make it,

27
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,601
you make the girl a
regular in your games.

And if you miss?

Well, then I guess I'm
buying the girl a new ball.

Yes!

Hey.

00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:17,936
You want to play with us?

33
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:19,113
No.

00:01:19,198 --> 00:01:20,484
But she does.

35
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:25,748
You do bar mitzvahs, too?

36
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:30,855
Why'd you want to meet me?

37
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,291
Company needs a favor.

38
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,373
A British doctoral
candidate on a federal grant

39
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:37,818
overstayed his visa;
He's in the wind.

40
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:39,907
Call ICE. Dorian Endicott.

41
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:41,263
College mathematician.

42
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:43,108
Loudmouth. Drinks too much.

43
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:44,521
Could be on a bender.

44
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:46,219
Call his sponsor.

45
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:47,506
His family's connected.

46
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:49,678
They don't want him
to embarrass them,

47
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:52,746
so they reached out to MI6
who reached out to the CIA

48
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,574
who then reached out to me.

49
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:56,577
Look, I'm sorry, Bish.

50
00:01:56,662 --> 00:01:58,857
I got a spa weekend
with my aunt planned.

51
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:00,338
So, wait, whoa,
whoa. So grab him.

52
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,863
Drop him off at the
British, Consulate,

53
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:04,756
and then go get your
broccoli emulsion.

54
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:07,325
- You know that's not a thing.
- Look, hey.

55
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,241
Company asked for
you, Robyn, by name.

56
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:12,113
Do this, they'll give
you some rhythm,

57
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:13,506
at least for a while.

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,769
Don't you think I'm
a little overqualified

59
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:18,468
for a lost-and-found detail?

60
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:20,600
Well, maybe our friends
are just trying to remind you

61
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:23,193
that they're still
pulling your strings.

62
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:24,802
It's a milk run.

63
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:27,237
Not worth kicking up dust over.

64
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:33,091
It's the end of
the fiscal quarter,

65
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:36,616
and one of the charities
I'm consulting for is slammed.

66
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,226
They sent up a flare.

67
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,793
I understand. I'll be
there by, like, 5:00.

68
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:40,881
6:00, latest.

69
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:41,974
Robyn.

70
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,655
I would feel better if
you made me feel worse.

71
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,974
I mean, I-I had a month to plan.

72
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:48,498
And you're presenting later.

73
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:50,978
It's a creative
visualization seminar,

74
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,980
not a gender reveal,
and you're my guest,

75
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:54,373
so the room's comped anyway.

76
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,027
Just get there
when you get there.

77
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:58,417
Tonight. I promise.

78
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:02,120
Is that all you're packing?

79
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:04,078
What? I just need my homework.

80
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,819
I've got enough
clothes at Dad's.

81
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:07,255
Well, don't forget about

82
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:09,040
your community service
hours this weekend.

83
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:11,129
Okay. I only skipped
once, all right?

84
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:12,522
Yeah, and lied about it.

85
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,785
Yes, but I was still
planning on doing it

86
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:16,047
when I told you I did it.

87
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:17,513
But if you want
to be technical...

88
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,161
No, I want to be honest.

89
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:21,182
And every time you lie to me

90
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:23,139
makes me wonder what
else you're lying to me about.

91
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:24,315
So.

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,923
Don't.

93
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:28,781
'Cause I'll find out.

94
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,840
Get a massage, Mom. Please.

95
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:32,396
I swear I am.

96
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:35,136
Bye.Bye.

97
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:39,200
So that doctoral candidate
you're looking for

98
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,811
I don't think he's
just on a bender.

99
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:43,584
He, deleted all his
social media recently.

100
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:45,373
He hasn't been on his
cell phone in three days.

101
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,557
And he hasn't
accessed his email.

102
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,210
So he just ghosted?

103
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:51,256
Yeah, full-on Casper.

104
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,075
It's like the guy
suddenly dropped off

105
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,643
the face of the earth.

106
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:56,162
And then he

107
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:57,904
started erasing himself.

108
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:00,610
Well, I think I know where
his grant money went.

109
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:03,466
Expensive Scotch.

110
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,963
Fine cigars.

111
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,775
What did you say
he was studying?

112
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:12,059
Heuristic algorithms

113
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:14,061
as applied to
stochastic systems.

114
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:15,585
English, Harry.

115
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:17,225
It's a way to account
for uncertainty.

116
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,806
It's used for
financial modeling,

117
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,199
insurance risk assessments.

118
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:22,896
Random systems.

119
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,539
Sexy.

120
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,545
Yeah, if your idea
of sex is Java script.

121
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,075
I happen to be more
of a Python man,

122
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:29,250
but you know that.

123
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,296
Keep your Python to yourself.

124
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,615
Got a letter here from the
NSF about his research grant.

125
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,911
I wouldn't be too impressed.

126
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:38,089
They tend to toss those
things around like confetti.

127
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:40,871
Well, it looks like the party
was over for Mr. Endicott,

128
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:44,306
'cause it's a notice of
the grant's expiration.

129
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,337
Excuse me.

130
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:47,966
Who are you?

131
00:04:50,294 --> 00:04:52,099
Sue Wachtell.

132
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:53,623
NSF grants committee.

133
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:56,277
I'm here to get an update
on Mr. Endicott's research.

134
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:59,280
Phillip Moss.
Chair of the Math Department.

135
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:00,849
I'll save you some time.

136
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,724
The climate change
algorithm you've been funding,

137
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,678
I doubt he got off square one.

138
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:07,114
Why do you say that?

139
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:09,552
He's a unique personality.

140
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:10,988
Half the time he didn't show.

141
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:12,818
The other half he...

142
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:14,342
Well, here.

143
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,820
His students compiled these

144
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:18,125
for HR.

145
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,562
Anyone?

146
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,607
This is completely pointless.

147
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:25,132
None of you will ever get
jobs that don't involve a spatula.

148
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:27,657
Let me put this in terms
you can understand.

149
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,615
You're an imbecile.

150
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:30,747
My.

151
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,662
Is he drunk?

152
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:34,045
I'm tasked

153
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,054
with notifying him
of his suspension.

154
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,179
If I can find him.

155
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:40,669
Well, he must have friends.

156
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,976
Someone who would
send him an orchid?

157
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,747
Orchid, no.

158
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,326
Arsenic, yes.

159
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:49,684
If you find him,
send him my way?

160
00:05:57,206 --> 00:06:00,208
Who would send
flowers to a guy like that?

161
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,372
Violina's.

162
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:10,593
Hi, my name is Shirley Kane,

163
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:13,702
and my boss got these
orchids, but I lost the card.

164
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:15,356
And so he can't
send a thank you note.

165
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,068
And if I don't tell
him who sent it,

166
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:18,882
I'm out of a job. I'm
already late on my rent.

167
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,177
I just, I... Calm down, ma'am.

168
00:06:20,262 --> 00:06:21,303
What's the name of your boss?

169
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:22,739
Endicott.

170
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:24,351
Dorian Endicott.

171
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,668
The sender was anonymous.

172
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,716
And all that was on the
card were these numbers.

173
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:30,888
Who sends an orchid
with a bunch of numbers?

174
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:33,285
Maybe it's a nerd's
idea of foreplay.

175
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,998
Or a code. I'm
running the three series

176
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,437
through a program that
matches up the numbers

177
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:39,561
with known cryptographs.

178
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,078
It could be a
decimal-based cipher.

179
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:42,685
A multiple encryption
numeric system.

180
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,921
Try dropping a period
after the initial two numbers

181
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,529
in the first two groupings.

182
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,068
- Whoa.
- What?

183
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:55,225
Longitude and latitude.

184
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:56,697
Here in New York.

185
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,835
Mel, the third grouping.

186
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,750
Military time.

187
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,055
18:30 is 6:30.

188
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,231
Yeah, 03 is March, and 26 is

189
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:05,904
the day... that's today.

190
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:07,067
That's now.

191
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,630
Secret meet. Already began.

192
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,890
This is about more than
just some missing lecturer.

193
00:07:10,974 --> 00:07:12,694
Run those coordinates
and get me an address.

194
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:14,040
All right.

195
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,255
Orchid.

196
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:52,617
Welcome to Chef Django's
Pop-up Dining Club.

197
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:53,793
Can I help you?

198
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:55,586
Do you have your
orchid invitation?

199
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,068
I believe my party is
popped up right there.

200
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:02,681
Finally.

201
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,545
What do I have to
do to get service?

202
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,536
Disembowel myself?

203
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:07,404
- I'm sorry?
- You should be.

204
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,448
What's this in my consommé?

205
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:12,794
Chervil, meaning
it's not consommé.

206
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,451
Take this swill back.

207
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,389
See if there's a dog
you want to poison.

208
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:19,305
Then try decanting something
that doesn't come in a box.

209
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,872
That's not chervil.

210
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:22,439
It's Queen Ann's lace.

211
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:23,974
Perfect for consommé.

212
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,573
As for the wine,
I'm sure you can arrange

213
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:29,447
for a sommelier on your flight
back to bonnie old England.

214
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:32,276
The Consulate sent you.

215
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,714
Who are you? Some
low-rent diplomatic aide?

216
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,147
I'm the person who gets
you where you belong.

217
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:40,501
You're an errand girl
dispatched by dilettantes

218
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:42,326
to pester a connoisseur.

219
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,748
I paid a ransom for this
seat at Chef Django's pop-up.

220
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,855
And I'm not moving

221
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:49,075
until I have tasted
the last petit four.

222
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,860
Understand?

223
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:52,388
Perfectly.

224
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:56,039
Assault.
False imprisonment.

225
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,476
I just ripped your shirt, so
add destruction of property.

226
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,780
Get down, get down!

227
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:05,030
Who are they?

228
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:07,161
- How should I know?
- You're lying.

229
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:22,671
Dorian?

230
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,310
Dorian?!

231
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,374
Damn.

232
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,324
You snake.

233
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:31,993
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE EQUALIZER (2021)*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01  Episode 05</font>

235
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,314
Madam Director.

236
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,755
I see you're still
going for the heart.

237
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,376
I'm a romantic. Yeah.

238
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:54,361
So, how's the gig?

239
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,202
You'd have loved it.

240
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,648
Too bad you called the
Director of National Intelligence

241
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:01,592
a rock-licking moron.

242
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,129
I like to tell it like it is.

243
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,009
Which makes one of us.

244
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:07,243
So, that milk run that

245
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,681
you sent McCall on
turned into a firefight.

246
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:12,454
As far as we knew, it
was a standard retrieval.

247
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:15,236
And now Endicott's in the wind.

248
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:16,454
Thanks to McCall.

249
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,674
Is that really how you want

250
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,416
to play this, Suri?

251
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:21,220
Who is this guy, anyway?

252
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,751
What's going on?

253
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:26,531
You don't know, do you?

254
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,407
Look, tell McCall we're
sorry how this went down.

255
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:30,532
Okay?

256
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:32,709
And given the
evolving situation,

257
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:35,065
it would be best if she
brought Endicott directly to us

258
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,453
instead of the Brits.

259
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:37,672
Yeah. Okay.

260
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,065
So, Nash says

261
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:40,849
sorry you almost got
your ticket punched,

262
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:41,884
but

263
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,634
do us another solid.

264
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:44,940
I think that'll play well.

265
00:10:45,414 --> 00:10:47,222
We'll make it worth her while.

266
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,145
Wait.

267
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,626
So, I bring in Endicott,

268
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,618
and my account is
squared permanently

269
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,099
with the CIA?

270
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:57,884
No more looking
over my shoulder?

271
00:10:57,969 --> 00:10:59,347
Straight from the
director's mouth.

272
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:01,916
Director Nash is not the
type to sweeten the pot.

273
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,702
I think the stakes have changed,

274
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,371
and I think something
big's going down,

275
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,480
but they're not sharing.

276
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,830
I'm in.

277
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:09,528
Be worth it to have
them out of my life.

278
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:11,839
But I've been burned
by Nash before so

279
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:14,713
I'll deliver Endicott after I
know I'm not being played.

280
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:17,222
I still have contacts
in British intelligence,

281
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,128
so I'm gonna ask
some questions, okay?

282
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,627
Thanks, Bishop.

283
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:23,414
Is that the shoot-out?

284
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,738
Yeah, from a security
cam next door.

285
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,391
Hang on, zoom in on that guy.

286
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:31,987
That tat.

287
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,638
Sharpen the res?

288
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:37,783
He's Triad.

289
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,222
What are Chinese gangsters doing

290
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:40,551
trying to kill a
British math whiz?

291
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:41,682
They're not.

292
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,925
Harry, trace the trajectory

293
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,707
of the shots fired Dorian's way.

294
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,480
They weren't
shooting at Endicott.

295
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,886
No, they were shooting at
me. They wanted him alive.

296
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,226
Harry, you got to track
where Endicott went.

297
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:55,387
What do you think
I'm doing here?

298
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:56,736
It's like Where's Waldo?

299
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:58,336
With smoke, gunfire
and low-res video.

300
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,292
Well, that's why
you're the best.

301
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:03,136
Where you going?

302
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,496
Chinatown, to see an old friend.

303
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:21,276
Geez, I didn't know people
still read newspapers.

304
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:23,543
What's the latest?

305
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:27,839
"Man's Serenity Shattered
by Uninvited Intruder."

306
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:31,812
Well, relax, I won't
overstay my welcome.

307
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,356
What do you know about
a British mathematician

308
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:35,816
who might've overstayed his?

309
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:37,575
I'm a retired antiques dealer.

310
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,819
Why should I know anything?

311
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:40,386
Because you like to
stay out of the headlines,

312
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,994
and I know a thing or
two about killing a story.

313
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,116
Word is that said mathematician

314
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:49,308
might have discovered
something that's a matter

315
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,183
of urgent British
national security.

316
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:54,922
How urgent?

317
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,355
Such that if someone were
to find said mathematician,

318
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:02,153
they would be wise
to bring him directly

319
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:03,496
to the British Consulate

320
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,192
and leave him in
their rear view mirror

321
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:07,261
if they want to see old age.

322
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:09,284
Now

323
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,460
if you'll excuse me,

324
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,159
this is my hour of Zen.

325
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:15,290
You know

326
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,028
those things'll
kill you someday.

327
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:20,426
So will associating with you.

328
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,426
It's always a pleasure, Glenn.

329
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,791
Meaning this is not
entirely a social call.

330
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:48,367
What do you need?

331
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:50,717
Intel... on the Triads.

332
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:54,025
Specifically what they want
with a British grad student.

333
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:58,551
Yeah, news of your little
escapade is making the rounds.

334
00:13:58,635 --> 00:13:59,595
The Triads don't want him.

335
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,206
The Chinese government does.

336
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,338
Endicott has something
they want to buy.

337
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:06,559
A source tells me the item has
national security implications.

338
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:09,040
Which explains why
Beijing farmed it out.

339
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:12,043
They don't want their
fingerprints anywhere near this.

340
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:13,653
Be careful, Robyn.

341
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:15,742
Word is, whatever
that guy's selling,

342
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:18,049
there are a lot of
interested parties.

343
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,746
What kind of parties?

344
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,615
The kind that shoot first
and ask questions later.

345
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,927
Hey, so I was able to
track Endicott from the alley,

346
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,712
stitching together ATM,
traffic cam and satellite footage.

347
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:31,845
He ducked into this computer
store on 54th and Broadway

348
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,716
before I lost him. You lost him?

349
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,283
He went into the subway.
That's why I'm down here.

350
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,589
It's hard to find me.

351
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:38,478
You know, you lost
him too, by the way.

352
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:39,871
Well, people were
shooting at me.

353
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:41,508
Yeah. What's he typing?

354
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:43,248
I hacked the
computer he was using.

355
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:44,945
But he erased everything...
Hard drive, meta data.

356
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,726
There's no protocol...
Run back the video.

357
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:47,946
Why?

358
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:49,928
There's more than
one way to hack that data.

359
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,515
Zoom in on his fingers?

360
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:57,531
One of my first
assignments was surveilling

361
00:14:57,616 --> 00:15:00,649
a Serbian diplomat
through his hotel window.

362
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,388
Now, we couldn't
get into his laptop,

363
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,063
so I had to go old-school.

364
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:06,156
I learned to copy
his keystrokes.

365
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,140
So play that again, and put

366
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:10,358
what I'm typing
up on the screen.

367
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:24,508
So whatever this threat
to national security is,

368
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:26,071
he was gonna sell
it to the Chinese.

369
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,336
You got in the way and
now he's found another buyer.

370
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:31,122
Yeah, and I got 19
minutes to stop him.

371
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:34,210
Watching fingers typing?

372
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:36,671
That's analog...
I don't do analog.

373
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:39,254
You'll get 'em next time, babe.

374
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,222
This is it.

375
00:15:43,554 --> 00:15:45,568
As promised.

376
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:49,742
Right, yes.

377
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:52,187
Check it.

378
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,406
It's good, yes?

379
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,984
Da, very good.

380
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,689
The money then?

381
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,609
And the other payment?

382
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:26,281
Nice doing business with you.

383
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:38,848
Who are you meeting
with and what did you sell?

384
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,835
I don't know what you're...

385
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:48,946
That's Gregor Shostakovich.
Russian intelligence.

386
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:51,551
You think you can do business
with them and they won't bury you?

387
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:53,680
They're coming back for me.

388
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,361
- We have to get...
- Tell me what you sold if you want my help.

389
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:57,879
I promise whoever you're
working for won't want me dead.

390
00:16:57,964 --> 00:16:59,289
Please, they're coming!

391
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:01,741
Come on!

392
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,297
You broke my clavicle.
I'll break more than that

393
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:10,263
if you don't tell me what
you sold the Russians.

394
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,349
You really don't know
anything, do you?

395
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:13,834
- I know you're a traitor.
- Hardly.

396
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:15,802
That piece of software
they just bought,

397
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:18,618
after I demoed it, I activated
a self-delete feature.

398
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:19,906
So it's software.

399
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:21,082
Yes, fine.

400
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,421
It's software.

401
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:24,617
Only what I just sold
them no longer works,

402
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:27,360
meaning I just defrauded
an enemy of this country.

403
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:29,821
Which makes me
a hero, not a traitor.

404
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:30,726
You're welcome.

405
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:32,424
You just ripped off
Russian intelligence.

406
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,232
That just makes you stupid.

407
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:35,676
At least I didn't
kill one of them.

408
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:37,235
I have rights.

409
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:41,117
I demand to know who you
are and where you're taking me.

410
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,282
Like I said,

411
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,383
I'm the person who gets
you to where you belong.

412
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,499
And right now that
destination is a toss-up.

413
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:50,054
'Cause we are equidistant
between three places.

414
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:51,771
A CIA black site,

415
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:53,766
a Triad dog fighting kennel,

416
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,470
and a Russian bathhouse.

417
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:56,602
Take your pick.

418
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:58,320
Okay.

419
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,468
What I have has to be destroyed.

420
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,651
That's why I swindled
those Neanderthals.

421
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:05,088
So I could get enough
money to disappear

422
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:06,915
and protect the world
from my discovery.

423
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,135
That's all you need to know.

424
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:10,671
- Okay, I'm taking you to the CIA.
- No, wait!

425
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:13,352
I can't tell you,
but I can show you.

426
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,968
I have a place in
Brighton Beach,

427
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,274
where I stashed
a copy of the file.

428
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:17,840
Take me there, I'll
show you everything.

429
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,799
And then you can decide
whether to turn me in.

430
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:22,141
If I'm lying, it's two
hours of your life.

431
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,844
If I'm not, you might
just save the world.

432
00:18:29,156 --> 00:18:32,820
I'm supposed to be having a
hot stone massage right now.

433
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,414
Figured you'd take the
deal... you want to know why?

434
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:47,242
<i>♪ Hit 'em with a 20 piece...</i>

435
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,007
Because your skill set suggests

436
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,990
you once were
part of the system.

437
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,054
One you're not rushing
to return to.

438
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:55,907
Your culinary sophistication

439
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:57,257
suggests a degree
of worldliness.

440
00:18:57,341 --> 00:19:00,640
And you recognized
a Russian operative on sight.

441
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:04,134
I thus conclude you're
a former international operative

442
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:06,312
now plying your trade
as some sort of...

You're a stone-cold narcissist.

00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:15,928
So whatever
you discovered

448
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:17,875
is not for the benefit

449
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,149
unless by accident.

450
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:22,064
You're well into your 30s
and still chasing a doctorate.

451
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:24,289
Which means you're

455
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:33,743
A breakthrough even a troglodyte

456
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:35,382
could deploy
for world domination.

457
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,734
A weapon any government
would kill for.

458
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:40,257
The product of a lazy
and undisciplined mind?

459
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:41,606
I beg to differ.

460
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,782
So it's an easy-to-use

you plan on ministering

00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:57,883
Even a condemned man
gets a last meal.

466
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,885
Or didn't they teach you that
at kidnapper

467
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:01,365
finishing school? Fine.

468
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,542
There's a place nearby that
has pretty good cuisine.

469
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,656
We'll make a stop.

470

A mini-mart? You're joking.

471

The chili dog is

Oh, pairs nicely

Fine.

475
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:25,765
I'll take pistachios,
unsalted

476
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,247
and in their natural state,
not dyed that ungodly red.

477
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:29,684
And a Flake Bar.

478
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,751
And if they don't have Flake,
a Curly Wurly will do.

479
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:34,468

- What, you never had...
- Mom?

485
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:52,459
Delilah?

486
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,635
And Kelly, wow.

487
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,333
Hey, Robyn, uh...

488
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,117
what a coincidence.

489
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,018
Yeah, Mom,
what are you doing here?

490
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,488
Just...

491
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:03,122
stopped for some gas.

492
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:04,776
Well, I-I don't...
I just, I thought you...

493
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,463
Uh, Dee told us that you were
going on a retreat with Vi,

494
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:10,511
but got slammed on a project?

495
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,174
Yes.

496
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:15,222
Um, something popped up
with one of my charities.

497
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,050
Gonna introduce us, Robyn?

498
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:20,705
This is my colleague,

499
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,863
Frank Brady
from accounting.

500
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,797
Frank, this is my
daughter Delilah.

501
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,366
And this is my ex's
new wife Kelly.

502
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,205
Nice to meet you, Frank.

503
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:33,370
Oh, the pleasure's
all mine.

504
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:36,924
So, we were just, um...

505
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,722
- Working late.
- Yeah.

506
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,246
Reconciling the books.

507
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,334
A nightmare,

508
00:21:41,418 --> 00:21:43,354
but we hacked our way
through it.

509
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:45,512
But wouldn't you know it,
my car broke down.

510
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,733
Thankfully, Robyn offered
to drive me home.

511
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:51,532
And she's so kind,
so thoughtful.

512
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:52,911
What brings
you to this

513
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,180
delightful emporium?

514
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:56,503
Headed to the Knicks game.
Bringing our stash,

515
00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:58,680
the good stuff.

516
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:00,745
Ah, red pistachios, delightful.

517
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:02,407
Yeah, Kelly,
we should go.

518
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:04,096
You know,
we'll miss tip-off.

519
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,576
Yeah, you guys go.

520
00:22:05,844 --> 00:22:07,317
I'll take care of it.

521
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:08,727
Yeah, I got you.

522
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:11,274
Yeah, well, um,
I'll tell Miles you say hi.

523
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,142
Thank you.

524
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:15,542
Yeah, nice meeting you,
Mr. Brady.

525
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,846
See ya.
Bye.

526
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,180
Thank you.

527
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:28,101
I believe in being courteous
even to my captor.

528
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:30,687
Speaking of courtesy,
Robyn,

529
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:33,065
may I use the bathroom?

530
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:35,431
Go ahead.

531
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:36,824
So you'll uncuff me?

532
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:38,736
Not a chance.

533
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:54,243
What you got for me?

534
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:56,227
Well, I'm glad
you're still alive, McCall.

535
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:57,367
I wish I weren't.

536
00:22:57,451 --> 00:23:00,368
I just ran into my daughter
and almost blew my cover.

537
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:02,539
That's the dangers
of working close to home.

538
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:04,626
But that's not the only danger.

539
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:08,984
Your boy was telling the truth.

540
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:10,554
He ripped the Russians off,

541
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:13,034
big-time. $50 million.

542
00:23:13,118 --> 00:23:15,078
Wired to his account.

543
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:17,415
Doesn't make sense.
A guy as smart as Endicott,

544
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,214
why didn't he try
to hide the proceeds?

545
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,086
Greed makes people careless.

546
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:23,305
And now everybody's
hunting for him.

547
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,133
Which means
they're hunting me, too.

548
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:28,136
You know what my advice is?

549
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,790
Throw him in the trunk,

550
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:31,368
put a brick on the accelerator,

551
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,086
and let him drive
into the East River.

552
00:23:33,404 --> 00:23:36,059
Can't. I owe too much
on my car lease.

553
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:46,101
Bad news.

554
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:48,093
They didn't have
anything you'd want.

555
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:58,011
These are
absolutely vile.

556
00:23:58,096 --> 00:23:59,619
Enjoy.

557
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,018
You're a good mum.

558
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:03,890
Buttering me up
won't work.

559
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,102
I don't butter.

560
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:06,829
Your daughter said
it was nice to meet me

561
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,525
when it clearly was not.

562
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:09,796
That's good breeding.

563
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:11,250
You raised her well.

564
00:24:13,004 --> 00:24:14,547
Kelly's lovely, by the way.

565
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:17,070
Must be tough being replaced
by the newer model.

566
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:18,828
I can see why
your marriage soured,

567
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:20,820
given how controlling
and unreasonable you are.

568
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,538
You know, I don't see
a ring on your finger.

569
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:25,274
Which is surprising, considering
how much of a people person

570
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,945
- you are.
- I don't have time to cater

571
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,948
to the sensibilities
of my inferiors.

572
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:31,691
Some of us are too busy
trying to change the world.

573
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:39,938
Aunt Vi, hey.

574
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:42,210
I'm just checking on you, baby.

575
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:45,500
I feel really bad
that you couldn't slip away.

576
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,955
Oh. Me, too.
How'd the seminar go?

577
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,360
Packed to the gills.

578
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,969
But now that I'm done,

579
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,477
I should come back.
Keep my girl company.

580
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:55,963
No. No way.

581
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:58,493
No need to ruin both
of our weekends.

582
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,426
Call if you change your mind.

583
00:25:00,523 --> 00:25:01,969
Don't work too hard.

584
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:03,667
All right.

585
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:05,582
Lying constantly

586
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:06,758
to everyone
you care about...

587
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:08,717
must be tiring.

588
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:11,382
Oh...

589
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:13,757
We're here.

590
00:25:16,436 --> 00:25:17,835
What are you doing?

591
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:20,567
- You don't need that.
- Like you never lied to me before. Open it.

592
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:23,904
It's okay.

593
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:25,645
I'm sorry. It's okay.

594
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:26,733
I'm sorry.

595
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,343
She's a friend.

596
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:31,824
This is Anya.
My son, Titus.

597
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,914
You have a son?

598
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:37,357
How did we miss that?

599
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:39,006
I've gone to
great lengths

600
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,122
to keep this part
of my life a secret.

601
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,002
How's my
favorite boy?

602
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,663
Nice to meet you both.

603
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:52,977
All right, look.

604
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:54,706
I got you here,

605
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,339
so I kept my end
of the bargain.

606
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:58,269
Time for you to keep yours.

607
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:03,526
The flash drive with
the software on it...

608
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:04,960
is here.

609
00:26:07,118 --> 00:26:08,819
The only thing
in this apartment

610
00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:10,864
is my girlfriend
and my son.

611
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:14,558
And I am keeping you
until they get away.

612
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:19,487
Because you think
she has these?

613
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:30,404
I took the diamonds off you
at the gas station, genius.

614
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,400
That pouch you
slipped her...

615
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:36,411
Gummy bears?

616
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:37,753
How did you...

617
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:40,453
The 50 million
the Russians paid you...

618
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:42,594
it was too easy to find.

619
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:45,347
You wanted people chasing
it while you slipped away.

620
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:48,058
Because the real payment would
be something untraceable.

621
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:51,723
Something that could be sold
anywhere, any time.

622
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:54,734
Perfect for someone
planning to disappear.

623
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:58,390
Which is why you're going
to give them to me.

624
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:01,567
Not until you tell me
what's going on.

625
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,645
You're in no position...

626
00:27:06,177 --> 00:27:08,095
This is your last chance,

627
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:09,990
and then
I am taking you in.

628
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:12,363
Please, I beg you.

629
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:13,999
Just let us go.

630
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,847
You know I can't do that.

631
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:19,035
Then let them go.
You're a parent, too.

632
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,379
All I want is a future
for my child,

633
00:27:21,464 --> 00:27:23,458
even if I don't have one.

634
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:25,683
Lock me up
and throw away the key.

635
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:27,113
Only, please, just

636
00:27:27,198 --> 00:27:29,548
leave them
out of this.

637
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,518
Whatever it is you're hiding,

638
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:43,331
these people will not stop
hunting you for it.

639
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:45,180
And your family.

640
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:47,964
You want to save them?

641
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:51,181
Then you need
to trust me,

642
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,863
because right now,

643
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:55,105
I'm the only one
who can help you.

644
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,880
Mummy's the boss,
little man.

645
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:05,662
I love you.

646
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,293
Promise they'll be safe?

647
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:15,150
You have my word.

648
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:17,757
Now let's talk.

649
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:21,730
I need a drink.

650
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:27,073
You really shouldn't be
out in the open.

651
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:30,019
You wouldn't begrudge me
one last pleasure as a free man.

652
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,706
Start talking. Now.

653
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:36,575
I met Anya at an A.I. conference
a few years ago.

654
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,970
But her father was
a prominent Soviet physicist.

655
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:42,465
I didn't think the U.S. would
appreciate the relationship,

656
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,104
so I kept it secret.

657
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:45,323
Well, what does the relationship
with your family

658
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:46,803
have to do
with people chasing you?

659
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:48,282
Nothing.

660
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:50,197
But it has everything to do
with my discovery.

661
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:51,721
The grant didn't
pay enough,

662
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:54,542
so I started a new
side project.

663
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:56,551
And I discovered
something big.

664
00:28:56,636 --> 00:28:58,684
Unfathomably big.

665
00:28:58,768 --> 00:28:59,809
Two vodkas.

666
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:01,707
Mm. Vodka?
Please.

667
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:02,906
I loathe vodka.
It's tasteless.

668
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,646
It's not for you. I figured

669
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,388
a sophisticate like you would
have a more discerning palate.

670
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,477
There you go.

671
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:10,870
They're not for me, either.

672
00:29:10,954 --> 00:29:13,873
<i>♪ High off love
when you lookin' at me ♪</i>

673
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:15,745
<i>♪ I'm the type of chick
you put on repeat ♪</i>

674
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:18,051
<i>♪ I'm a bad girl,
I go hard like a freak ♪</i>

675
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:19,879
<i>♪ Trust me, baby, you don't want
a problem with me ♪</i>

676
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:22,055
<i>♪ Red octagon
when you try to stop me. ♪</i>

677
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,934
- Who are they?
- Russians.

678
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:29,680
The word is out.

679
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:31,247
They're coming for you.

680
00:29:31,332 --> 00:29:32,677
I really am gonna die.

681
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:34,067
Nowhere's safe.

682
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:35,690
There's one place.

683
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,317
Come on.

684
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,267
A secret lair.

685
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:50,524
How original.
Who's this?

686
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:51,831
Your Alfred?

687
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:53,832
You're right.
He is an ass.

688
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,028
Yeah, he is.
Sit down.

689
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:58,756
This is my associate.

690
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,106
And you're going to tell
both of us what you discovered.

691
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:02,977
I'll need a Scotch first.

692
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:04,277
Now.

693
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:06,412
Philistine.

694
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:10,356
Like I told you,

695
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,793
living grant to grant
wasn't cutting it.

696
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,119
As you now know,
I have expensive tastes

697
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:18,076
and costly responsibilities.
Occam's razor.

698
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:19,516
The most
efficient way

699
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,779
to make money is
to create it.

700
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:23,685
A cryptocurrency.

701
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,786
Well, he's not as dim
as he looks.

702
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,146
So this whole thing is about

703
00:30:27,231 --> 00:30:28,285
cryptocurrency?

704
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,469
No. See, the trick to crypto

705
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:32,994
is making sure the encryption
can never be broken.

706
00:30:33,178 --> 00:30:35,482
My day job is basically
machine learning

707
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,918
applied to random systems,
like climate.

708
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:40,840
So you modified the software
to test the encryption.

709
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:43,427
Yes. And it decoded it
instantly.

710
00:30:43,512 --> 00:30:44,919
I assumed the currency
was a flop

711
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:48,176
until I ran the software test
against Bitcoin.

712
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:49,849
It decrypted it instantly, too.

713
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:51,504
No. That's impossible.

714
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:53,506
No, it's reality.

715
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:55,987
I wanted to create
a new currency.

716
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:58,163
Instead, I made

717
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:01,318
the most powerful
decryption tool known to man.

718
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:03,536
A master key that can access
any information

719
00:31:03,621 --> 00:31:06,171
on any network
anywhere in the world.

720
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:08,653
I call it the God Algorithm.

721
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,942
Because...
what, you're God?

722
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:14,434
Well, it is my creation.

723
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:17,530
So you're saying
you can hack into any network,

724
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:19,129
anywhere?

725
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:21,332
Nuclear codes,
world banking systems?

726
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,884
I'm not "just saying."
It's a fact.

727
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,843
Well, if that's the truth,

728
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,013
then anyone who owns that key
owns the world.

729
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:30,333
Which is why I erased it,
and why people

730
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:31,762
- are trying to kill me.
- Oh.

731
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:34,286
Yeah, I-I'm not buying it.

732
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:37,379
Uh, you destroyed
your masterpiece?

733
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:40,687
I mean, DaVinci would never
destroy the Mona Lisa.

734
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,298
He would if he kept a copy.

735
00:31:42,455 --> 00:31:45,989
And the most important copy
is right here.

736
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,215
Okay, so,

737
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:52,934
you made it,
you're gonna recreate it.

738
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,215
Want me to risk my life
to save yours?

739
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,582
I want to know who
and what I'm protecting.

740
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:17,254
Done.

741
00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:20,840
What do you want me
to hack into?

742
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:23,074
Try the Fed.

743
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,795
Okay, the Fed.

744
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:26,991
Don't worry,
it's the most secure

745
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:28,383
financial system
in the world.

746
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:30,332
There's no possible
way he could...

747
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:33,708
No.

748
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:35,130
No, that's just...

749
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:37,090
that's just not possible.
Shall we see

750
00:32:37,175 --> 00:32:39,223
how America's strategic reserves
are doing?

751
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,567
Get off that site, now.

752
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:42,136
Like I told you,
we're untraceable.

753
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,364
Hey.

754
00:32:46,153 --> 00:32:47,943
How about a real challenge?

755
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:49,753
Assuming you have
the imagination.

756
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,681
Yeah, maybe.

757
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:54,813
Uh... NORAD.

758
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:58,629
Hack NORAD.
It's the most

759
00:32:58,714 --> 00:33:00,756
firewalled security network
on the face of the earth.

760
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,850
Not even
a coordinated cyber...

761
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:10,295
Shall we play a game?

762
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,124
Oh, my God.

763
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,473
Now you're getting it.

764
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:16,475
The God Algorithm
can decrypt anything.

765
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,695
And anyone who has it
can play God.

766
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,869
Yeah, making it
the ultimate weapon.

767
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:27,486
Which is why I tried
to keep it a secret.

768
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:30,271
But given
my obvious bona fides,

769
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:32,362
I was probably being monitored.

770
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:34,928
And once word of
my pièce de résistance got out,

771
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,190
my fate was sealed.

772
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,988
So I drank some great wine,

773
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:40,690
ate some great meals,

774
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:42,256
and prepared for the end.

775
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:47,870
No one can have the algorithm.
Ever.

776
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,856
Which means
no one can have me,

777
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,034
because, like it or not, I'm the
most dangerous man in the world.

778
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:59,763
Guess we better get you
that Scotch now.

779
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:08,230
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

780
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:10,223
I mean, do you have any idea

781
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:11,573
of the ramifications
of this?

782
00:34:11,657 --> 00:34:13,662
This is
Oppenheimer territory.

783
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:17,492
"I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

784
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:20,365
I mean, he's right.

785
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:23,281
We can't let anybody
have this. Or him.

786
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:27,851
I mean, there is only one
logical conclusion.

787
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,409
Which is?

788
00:34:30,597 --> 00:34:32,504
He has to die.

789
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:35,995
No one's dying,
not on my watch.

790
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:40,776
You back?

791
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:42,866
Yeah, and the CIA knows
you have Dorian.

792
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:45,418
She's got a red letter out
on you. So do the British.

793
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:48,629
So do the Chinese. Not to
mention that Russian kill team.

794
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,473
<i>Especially after that
little tea party</i>

795
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,182
<i>you had with
Gregor Shostakovich.</i>

796
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:53,403
Don't worry about it, though.

797
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:54,878
I cleaned it up
like I always do.

798
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:57,184
But now everyone knows
what he has.

799
00:34:57,268 --> 00:34:59,074
I can manage the situation.

800
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,058
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

801
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,407
What are you suggesting?

802
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:04,550
That I turn him over to Nash?

803
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,761
We both know what
she'll do to him.

804
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,544
Well, it's better than leaving
Endicott with that algorithm.

805
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:11,816
- He won't use it.
- Well, not today.

806
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,721
What about tomorrow?
You know what they say

807
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:14,966
about absolute power, don't you?

808
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,824
No. He has a son he loves.

809
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,425
He'll do anything to
make the world safer for him.

810
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,818
And you're basing this
on what?

811
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,690
- His say-so?
- On 20 years

812
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:27,464
of betting my life
on my ability to read people.

813
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:29,259
I'm not feeding him
to the machine.

814
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,741
Listen, you play ball,

815
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,196
and you can put the Company
behind you forever.

816
00:35:34,321 --> 00:35:35,533
But then what does that make me?

817
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:38,626
The whole world is looking for
this guy, Robyn.

818
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:40,746
How're you gonna hide him?

819
00:35:42,748 --> 00:35:44,626
Same as the Clockmaker.

820
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:47,134
We get him
across the border.

821
00:35:47,498 --> 00:35:49,932
Set up his family.
Keep him off-line.

822
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,103
Weekly touch-ins.

823
00:35:52,188 --> 00:35:54,111
And if he even tries
to pull anything,

824
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,591
I will find him
and press the button myself,

825
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:59,029
but I need your help,
Bish.

826
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,673
I need your resources.

827
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:03,290
So are you in
or are you out?

828
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:07,472
You know, this humanistic
streak of yours

829
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:09,391
is gonna get me killed
someday.

830
00:36:10,946 --> 00:36:13,779
I'm in, damn it.
Goodbye.

831
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:23,662
You sure about this?

832
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,628
I trust him with my life.

833
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,837
Bish?

834
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,297
I'm sorry, Robyn.

835
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:37,807
Too much at stake.

836
00:36:37,892 --> 00:36:39,418
It's got to be
this way.

837
00:36:39,503 --> 00:36:41,331
Thank you, William.

838
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:50,558
Let's go.

839
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:03,706
So, where you
taking him now?

840
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,534
Not your concern.

841
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,400
To a black site?

842
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:09,930
To all those dirty tricks
I walked away from?

843
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:12,540
Just like Ed and Michelle
in Venezuela.

844
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,485
Ends justify the means.

845
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,937
Everyone's expendable.

846
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:18,455
Including you.

847
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,505
Hold it.
We had a deal.

848
00:37:20,735 --> 00:37:22,725
She walks away from this.

849
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:27,869
Russians.

850
00:37:33,428 --> 00:37:35,865
Will! No!

851
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:42,742
No!

852
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:02,274
Get these cuffs off me!

853
00:38:06,026 --> 00:38:08,328
You just executed
an innocent man.

854
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,892
You knew what he had.

855
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:11,588
We couldn't afford
to let anyone else have it,

856
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:13,368
especially the Russians.

857
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:14,864
There was another way.

858
00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:16,605
You think that,
you've gone soft.

859
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:18,696
I'm off your call list.

860
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:20,043
I'm done.

861
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:21,871
Finished.
The hell you are.

862
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:24,656
This whole thing imploded
because you went rogue.

863
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:26,301
Meaning you
still owe us,

864
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:28,344
and we intend
to collect our debt.

865
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:33,864
Clean up this mess.

866
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:45,791
Nice, fellas.

867
00:38:46,806 --> 00:38:49,159
Oh, that was awesome.

868
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:51,553
I have to admit,
that was kind of fun.

869
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:52,815
Fun?

870
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:54,469
A dislocated rib cage
is fun?

871
00:38:54,553 --> 00:38:56,471
Not to mention
the fact I could've been...

872
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:58,125
what's the term
of art? Killed.

873
00:38:58,209 --> 00:38:59,256
Nope.

874
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,480
Double-tap to the chest,
her signature,

875
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:03,056
just like I told you.

876
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,219
My field involves
the study of randomness.

877
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:06,307
Variables you can't control.

878
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,048
I could've been shot
in the head.

879
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,814
Hey, take it easy.

880
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:11,703
Everybody thinks you're dead.Ow.

881
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:13,662
No one's gonna be
hunting you anymore.

882
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:15,229
Operational incompetence.

883
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:16,752
How you lot ever won
the Cold War...

884
00:39:16,836 --> 00:39:18,145
So, anyway,
how long do I have

885
00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:20,891
to stay mad at you for,
uh, "betraying me"?

886
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:25,017
Give it a couple months.

887
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,735
This is my friend Lou.

888
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:34,944
He'll take you across
the Saint Lawrence into Canada.

889
00:39:35,235 --> 00:39:37,338
Friend of mine will
meet you there, set you up.

890
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,340
Take you to the Yukon.

891
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:43,125
And you and your family
can disappear.

892
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,133
Oh.

893
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:47,055
You're gonna need these.

894
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:49,791
Ease up on the cognac.

895
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:52,003
It should last the three of you.

896
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:55,206
Who are you, Robyn?

897
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:57,097
Like I said...

898
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,708
I'm the one who gets you
where you belong.

899
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:01,871
I could always
look you up.

900
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:03,810
- I have a pretty good program.
- If you reconstitute

901
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:06,062
that algorithm, I'll find you.

902
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,851
And I'll kill you.

903
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:10,199
I believe you.

904
00:40:11,302 --> 00:40:13,786
Take care of your family, okay?

905
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:16,200
Nothing is more important.

906
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,512
God, I hate this country.

907
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:23,645
Good luck, Dorian.

908
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:30,562
Good luck, Canada.

909
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:55,151
So, I hear you had
quite a weekend.

910
00:40:57,562 --> 00:40:59,043
Delilah?

911
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:01,543
Got an earful when I
picked her up from her dad's.

912
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:05,034
How she busted you
on a date.

913
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:06,348
Robyn.

914
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:08,543
Now, look, if you'd rather hang

915
00:41:08,628 --> 00:41:10,021
- with some guy, you know, just...
- Hang?

916
00:41:10,105 --> 00:41:13,074
- Hang? I wasn't hanging.
- Just tell me next time.

917
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,496
I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.

918
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,317
It's nothing to handle.

919
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:19,331
Okay?
He was just a colleague.

920
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:20,995
An annoying one.

921
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,418
We spent the whole weekend
crunching numbers.

922
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:25,684
Is that what the kids
are calling it now?

923
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:29,108
Listen, I'm just glad
you had some fun.

924
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:30,478
I did not have any fun.

925
00:41:30,563 --> 00:41:31,912
I had no fun.

926
00:41:32,246 --> 00:41:33,794
Mmm.

927
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:37,685
But you may want to connect
with Delilah.

928
00:41:38,505 --> 00:41:40,897
After all those lectures
on lying you gave her,

929
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:43,156
she is not as understanding
as I am.

930
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,255
Well, that was awkward.

931
00:41:57,694 --> 00:41:59,133
You want to talk about it?

932
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:00,828
Nope.

933
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:05,575
Just makes
me wonder, Mom.

934
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:08,646
You were lying
about that...

935
00:42:09,637 --> 00:42:11,769
...what else
are you lying about?

936
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:20,672
