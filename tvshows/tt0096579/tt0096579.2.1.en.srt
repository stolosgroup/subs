I can't wait to get down with my bad self.

315
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,957
Now, before we all throw down...

316
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,658
I wanna take the time
to thank a young man...

317
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,358
who will always hold a
special place in my heart.

318
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:20,768
We wouldn't be here today if he hadn't
had the foresight to burn this place down.

319
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,305
- To Steve Urkel.
CARL: Hear, hear.

320
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,536
- All right, Steve.
- Oh, thanks, everybody.

321
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,479
And we'll all have burgers
just as soon as I fire up the grill.

322
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,177
RACHEL: Is it cute...? Fire up the
grill? CARL: What? Quick! Stop him!
