2
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:49,733
: I see you.

3
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:55,297
When
I was a little girl,

4
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,871
I imagined there was
nothing you were afraid of.

5
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,929
You were indestructible.

6
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:19,546
There was no one and nothing
that could ever hurt you.

7
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:28,296
There was no one and nothing
that you would ever let hurt me.

8
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:57,556
When I was a little
girl, you were a king.

9
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:00,494
And everything I knew
was your kingdom.

10
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:22,404
I guess what I'm asking is...

11
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:24,275
where did that guy go?

12
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:27,782
Well,

13
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:30,454
I hate to break
this to you, but...

14
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,592
you weren't very
bright as a kid, Emily.

15
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:35,532
I could've told you anything
and you would've bought it.

16
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:37,936
Oh, I think we both
know that isn't true.

17
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,340
Uh, and what makes you think

18
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:42,946
that I wasn't afraid of anything
when you were a little girl?

19
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,384
I was afraid of everything
that wasn't nailed down

20
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,121
when you were a little girl.

21
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,492
I just got good at
lying to you about it.

22
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:50,595
Yes, you did.

23
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:53,868
- Until recently.

24
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:55,772
I've noticed.

25
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:58,443
You don't sound like yourself.

26
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:01,482
You're preoccupied
when we're talking.

27
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:03,119
You're not sleeping.

28
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:05,725
I'm just asking you
what's the difference now.

29
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:09,465
I don't know. Something,
you know, just off.

30
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:14,508
-  - Listen, if this is
about what I think it's about,

31
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:17,381
then I understand
why it frightens you.

32
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:20,120
But I think you're fine.

33
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:25,497
Unless there's something
you're not telling me.

34
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,545
- Is there something you're not telling me?
- Oh, sorry.

35
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,806
No. No, of course not. Uh...

36
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,413
I got to run, sweetie.
I'll call you when I can.

37
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,517
- Okay.
- Okay.

38
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,223
- Bye-bye, love you.
- Bye. I love you.

39
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:43,601
Uh, she's pretty sure
everything's fine.

40
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:46,707
Huh.

41
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:58,396
Well...

42
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,467
let's go.

43
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:24,015
Mr. Chase?

44
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:27,689
-  - Yes.
- How you feeling this afternoon?

45
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,893
Dave and Carol.

46
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:32,197
Who are... Okay.
Okay, I got it.

47
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:34,870
Dave and Carol are your dogs.

48
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:36,716
I got a little confused for
a second there.

49
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,611
Why? Because they have names?

50
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:41,550
Well, 'cause they
have people's names.

51
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,486
You know, those are-those
are people's names.

52
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:46,894
Oh, not in this case.

53
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:49,533
Right. Um, you know what?

54
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:50,911
Why don't we just
start over, then?

55
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,739
Uh, good afternoon, Mr. Chase.

56
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:55,611
- I see you've brought your dogs into the...
- Uh, Dr. Howard...

57
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,216
never minded, you know.
I bring 'em everywhere.

58
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,020
Yeah, I'm Dr. Howard.

59
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,659
Oh. See,
I don't think so.

60
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,161
- Okay.
- Uh...

61
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:05,932
I'm guessing you were
expecting my mother.

62
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:08,069
I was expecting the
Dr. Howard I've been seeing

63
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,606
going on 17 years now.

64
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,942
Where might she be?

65
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,547
Well, she only sees
patients on Thursdays now.

66
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:14,950
- Thursdays?
- Yeah.

67
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:16,754
Uh, at her age,

68
00:07:16,787 --> 00:07:19,025
she, um, found it hard
to keep up the grind,

69
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:21,864
but I'm sure you know
all about that, right?

70
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:23,968
Okay. Uh...

71
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,510
We brought you in today to
talk about some results.

72
00:07:28,544 --> 00:07:30,915
- Oh.
- Looks like you recently underwent

73
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:33,721
a full preventative
screening here.

74
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:37,762
Yeah, we got physical,
cognitive and full labs.

75
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:40,267
Don't usually do the
cognitive without a request.

76
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,672
- Yeah, I requested it.
- Oh, okay.

77
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:44,508
- Um...

78
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:46,980
Are you experiencing
any symptoms?

79
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:49,786
Mm. Isn't that the nature
of cognitive impairments...

80
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,291
That you aren't
cognizant of them?

81
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,228
Not always.

82
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:56,700
Well...

83
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:58,604
not never, either.

84
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,748
No, I've not been
experiencing any symptoms.

85
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:07,555
- I've been feeling more anxious.
- Hmm.

86
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,862
Agitated. Um...

87
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:13,099
Maybe missing a few things.

88
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,270
My wife...

89
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:17,542
She went through this, so,

90
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,913
if I hadn't spotted it, I
don't think she would have,

91
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:23,821
so, I just want-wanted...
wanted to make sure.

92
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:25,625
I see.

93
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:33,607
So, are we sure?

94
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,310
I beg your pardon?

95
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:37,314
The cognitive test.

96
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,586
Oh, yes. Yeah, these look fine.

97
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,326
Nothing out of the ordinary?

98
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:45,030
Nope.

99
00:08:45,063 --> 00:08:46,633
Why, would you want there to be?

100
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,217
Remind me, we
got to go to the doctor

101
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,087
on Thursdays from now on.

102
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:21,603
Tell me I
shouldn't be worried right now.

103
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:24,609
Because the last time,

104
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:26,847
the answer to every
question I asked was,

105
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,351
"I'm fine, Emily, really,"

106
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,590
was when things
got bad with Mom.

107
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:40,775
I understand why you felt

108
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:42,979
like you needed to
protect me from it,

109
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:45,952
but I'm not a child.

110
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,256
And our situation is hard enough

111
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:50,928
without feeling like
you're trying to keep me

112
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:54,001
out of things that I
should be in with you.

113
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:57,040
Tell me I shouldn't be worried,

114
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,145
because I am.

115
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:03,419
Okay.

116
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:05,190
Please call me.

117
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:25,698
Oh, Abbey.

118
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,177
Sweetie.

119
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,081
- Oh.

120
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,755
: I'm sorry.

121
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,093
I-I don't know how I got here.

122
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:45,771
And then, I was afraid
if I came back to bed,

123
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:48,176
- you would see.
- Oh, come on, come on.

124
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,213
Come on to bed, now.

125
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,821
Let me get
you out of this.

126
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:07,381
Come on.

127
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:09,886
Love...

128
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,790
you should put me somewhere.

129
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:13,426
Yeah, I'm gonna put you to bed.

130
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:15,798
-  Come on.
- No. No.

131
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:18,236
Y-You should put
me away somewhere.

132
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:21,442
This isn't fair on you. No.

133
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,083
I am not what you married.

134
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:28,089
Oh, please don't say that.

135
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:30,962
- Come to bed.

136
00:11:30,995 --> 00:11:33,767
- I could be dangerous for you.

137
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:35,303
Makes things interesting.

138
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:40,848
Who am I?

139
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:47,227
You're the woman who
promised to take care of me.

140
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:51,837
You're the woman who I
promised to take care of.

141
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,341
Now, come on. Come on.

142
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,825
Who am I?

143
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,236
I know who you are.

144
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:12,177
I know what you are.

145
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,553
I see you.

146
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:26,345
Hals.

147
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:42,712
Aus.

148
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:55,036
You want to tell me your name?

149
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,093
Good dogs. Thank you.

150
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:36,372
911. What's your emergency?
- Yeah...

151
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,644
my name is-is Dan Chase.

152
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:42,183
I'm at 92 Neville
Street in Norwich.

153
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:46,058
A man just broke into
my house with a gun.

154
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:48,664
He fired at me, I fired back.

155
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:51,335
I...  I-I shot him.

156
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:54,474
I... I-I think he's dead.

157
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:57,414
Sir, please stay on the line.

158
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:58,684
Repeat your name again.

159
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,386
My name is Dan Chase.

160
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:17,287
So, you heard
the dogs barking downstairs.

161
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,124
You retrieved your weapon.

162
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:20,360
You descended the stairs,

163
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:22,665
at which point, the
intruder fired a shot.

164
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:24,334
You fire back, hitting
him in the chest.

165
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:25,838
That's correct. Yeah.

166
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,476
Dogs usually
downstairs at night?

167
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,814
No, they usually
sleep in my room.

168
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:33,185
Uh, they must have heard
something downstairs.

169
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,624
The barking is-is
what woke me up.

170
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:40,333
Wh-What was this?
Was it a robbery, or...

171
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:42,137
It's hard
to say for sure.

172
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,107
He seems well-dressed
for a vagrant,

173
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:46,121
- so that'd be my guess.
You don't have

174
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:49,117
any security issues
you're aware of, do you?

175
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,255
- Security?
Yeah.

176
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,794
- Business rivals, personal issues.
-  Oh, no, no.

177
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:56,265
You received any kind of
threats or anything lately?

178
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:58,436
No, no, I'm retired, so...

179
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,173
What'd you do
before you retired,

180
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:02,377
- if you don't mind me asking?
- Oh, real estate,

181
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,514
mostly, uh, down in Manhattan.

182
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,222
I kept the family
up here, though.

183
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,859
I never had any kind of problem.

184
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:11,863
Figured we were far
enough away from the city

185
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:14,501
to be free from all that.

186
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:17,340
Yeah, well, you'd be surprised.

187
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:19,746
Happens everywhere these days.

188
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:24,856
The silencer...
That's weird, though.

189
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:27,862
- That you don't usually see.
- Oh?

190
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,406
But then again, you
had that guy last week

191
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:36,613
- that held up a mini-mart in Lyndon with an AK-47.
- AK-47.

192
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:40,219
- Ah.
- So I shouldn't be surprised by much of anything anymore.

193
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,402
- Yeah.
We'll send the guys through in the morning

194
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:45,731
to do a more detailed
sweep-up, if that's all right.

195
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:47,300
I'm sure you had
a very long night.

196
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,204
You know, actually, uh...

197
00:18:49,237 --> 00:18:51,475
I have family in Milton.

198
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:53,312
If I give you the key,

199
00:18:53,346 --> 00:18:55,416
would it be all right
if I stayed with them?

200
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,287
We'll leave
it under the mat.

201
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,946
Hello?

202
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:12,217
Hey, kid, it's me.

203
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,722
Sorry to be calling
you at this hour.

204
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:19,431
Uh, they found me.

205
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,205
What?

206
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:25,209
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

207
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:27,982
Yeah, I'm fine.
The dogs are fine.

208
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:31,288
But if they found me at
the house, I can't go back.

209
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:33,660
Are you sure it was...

210
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:36,966
- it was them?
-  Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

211
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,772
Just because... after
all this time, you know,

212
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:42,711
- it seems pretty unlikely.
- Emily. Emily, I'm sure.

213
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:46,318
I've been feeling it
for a few weeks now.

214
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,289
I thought maybe it
was my imagination.

215
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:51,629
My head making up ghosts to
remind me I'm getting lazy.

216
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:55,269
I still have things
to worry about, but...

217
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:57,273
No, this is not a drill.

218
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,746
This is happening.

219
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,283
I got to go get ahead of it now.

220
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,989
Okay.

221
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:07,327
What can I do?

222
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,270
I'm, uh...

223
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:15,544
I'm thinking that, uh...

224
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:18,482
we're gonna have to
stay off the phones.

225
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,520
You know, I'm gonna
lay low for a bit,

226
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,290
just to be on the safe side.

227
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:26,398
Okay.

228
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,970
- How long?
- I don't know.

229
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:32,010
A week, maybe.

230
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:34,347
Couple of weeks.

231
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:39,357
A month, maybe.

232
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,637
I'm sorry.

233
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:48,008
No, don't say that.

234
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:52,350
- You've... You have nothing to apologize for.
- All right.

235
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,325
I'll call you as soon as I can.

236
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:58,964
Yeah. Right.

237
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:00,868
Okay. I love you, Dad.

238
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:03,807
I love you, too. Bye, kiddo.

239
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,388
What?

240
00:21:13,092 --> 00:21:14,962
I didn't lie to her.

241
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:18,369
There's no reason to
worry her right now

242
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,972
about things we don't know.

243
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:32,898
Space is the
breath of art.

244
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:38,409
You know who said that?

245
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:41,415
No.

246
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:48,730
Any idea what it means?

247
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:51,401
No. Do you?

248
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,913
Well, I... I think it means,
when you're building a house,

249
00:21:56,946 --> 00:22:00,486
you got to have a
place for everyone

250
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,825
and everything important.

251
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:07,868
But it's good to have
some space that's just...

252
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:10,373
you know, space.

253
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:13,479
Do you think this is too big?

254
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:18,422
Oh, no. I love what
we're building here.

255
00:22:18,455 --> 00:22:20,393
And I love building it with you.

256
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:24,869
I do think that we're
gonna be able to

257
00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:27,908
host a small army
in here, though,

258
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:30,046
by the time we're done.

259
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,751
It's just for our family.

260
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,521
Yeah?

261
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:38,897
A room for you and Grandma,

262
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,905
a room for me, and a
room for Mom and Dad.

263
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,978
For Mom and Dad?

264
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,052
In case somebody figures out

265
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:52,523
how to bring them back someday.

266
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,463
Harold?

267
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah?

268
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:20,446
There's a... there's
a call for you.

269
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,016
Oh.

270
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:26,659
Hello?

271
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:28,495
Uh, Assistant
Director Harper?

272
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,499
- This is Harper.
- Please hold.

273
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:35,544
Have you ever
thought it might help

274
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:38,182
- if he saw you cry?

275
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:41,956
Everyone cries around a kid
that's lost his parents.

276
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,628
I think just for variety's sake,

277
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:45,964
I'll be the one that doesn't.

278
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:49,839
The assistant
director is on the line.

279
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,178
Sir, this
is Raymond Waters.

280
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:55,116
Bob Blasky over at
DCS put me on to you.

281
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:56,494
I'm working a case
he thought you might

282
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,055
be able to be helpful with.

283
00:23:58,088 --> 00:23:59,625
What kind of case?

284
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:00,837
Now, I have been
granted SCI access

285
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:02,531
for the sake of
this interaction,

286
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:03,576
- just so you're aware.
- I understand.

287
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,902
What kind of case?

288
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:06,773
In July 1987,

289
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:09,110
a man under you went
MIA near Torkham.

290
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:12,116
- You know the man I'm referring to?
- Yes.

291
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,687
Well, my assignment
was to ascertain

292
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,590
whether the subject
was still in the wild,

293
00:24:15,624 --> 00:24:17,594
and if so, to locate
and retrieve him.

294
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:19,140
- Now, about two weeks ago...
- Retrieve?

295
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:21,602
- Yes, sir. Now, two weeks ago...
- What for?

296
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:23,606
-  Sorry. Excuse me?
- What for?

297
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:28,182
That file
has been resolved.

298
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:30,086
It's been sealed
for three decades.

299
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,523
Why is it coming up again now?

300
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,638
Sir, that's outside the
scope of my responsibilities.

301
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:36,107
I've got an operation
gone sideways here

302
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:38,102
and time is of the
essence. May I continue?

303
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:41,308
Yes.

304
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:43,613
Now, an operator was sent
to engage the subject.

305
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:47,654
That operator was dumped,
the subject is at large.

306
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:48,933
We do have redundancies
in place but,

307
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:50,627
given your history
with the subject,

308
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,664
DCS felt your insight
might prove valuable.

309
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:56,773
Sir, I'm instructed
to relay to you

310
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:58,686
your help was personally
requested by the secretary...

311
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,288
Yeah, I get it. I'll be
in the air in an hour,

312
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,883
on my way to you.

313
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:04,789
- Thank you, sir. I'll...

314
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,598
Is everything all right?

315
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:13,272
No.

316
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:18,282
(music playing
quietly on jukebox

317
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:33,580
Service
animals only.

318
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:37,286
Sorry?

319
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,290
They're not allowed
to be in here.

320
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:41,161
Only service animals.

321
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,641
Heh. Wa-Warming my
feet's not a service?

322
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,824
Coffee, black, and
some rye toast.

323
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:57,661
White or wheat?

324
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,005
Wheat, please.

325
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:12,366
Mr. Dixon, how are you?

326
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,962
Oh, great,
thanks, Stuart.

327
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:17,009
Listen, there's something
I'd like you to do for me.

328
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,337
Uh, I'm gonna be coming
out in a few days,

329
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,406
and I was wondering

330
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,845
if you can make sure
the house is ready.

331
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:26,953
Um, new sheets, uh, groceries.

332
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,357
No dairy, almond milk,
coffee, you know.

333
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,094
There ought to be a
list there somewhere.

334
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:33,967
Wonderful. And will Mrs.
Dixon be coming with you?

335
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:36,806
No.

336
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,910
No, no, she won't.

337
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:43,953
Uh, email me if you
have any questions.

338
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:46,024
Understood.

339
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:48,037
Looking forward to finally
putting a face to the name.

340
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,132
Uh, me, too.

341
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,669
So long.

342
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:17,286
- Waitress come yet?
- Yes, I sent her away.

343
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,725
There are too many options.

344
00:27:19,758 --> 00:27:21,696
Uh...

345
00:27:23,198 --> 00:27:25,871
Listen, there's something I
need to talk to you about.

346
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:27,440
I'll never get used to this.

347
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:29,210
You people and your menus.

348
00:27:29,244 --> 00:27:31,782
There are three pages
of just pancakes.

349
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:36,759
What?

350
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,328
What is it?

351
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:42,704
Uh...

352
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,877
Ordinarily,

353
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:49,417
when I get the feeling
I've been having all day...

354
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,288
Like...

355
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:54,093
trouble is starting
to get close...

356
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:56,031
I'd tell you it's time
for us to move again.

357
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:58,468
Get ahead of things before
things catch up to us.

358
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:01,474
But, um...

359
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:05,516
Um...

360
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,163
What if we don't keep running?

361
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:16,037
What if we find a
place to stand still

362
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,208
and we build something there?

363
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:23,886
- Build what kind of something?
- Uh...

364
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:27,894
A home.

365
00:28:29,163 --> 00:28:32,470
Life. A reality.

366
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,507
A place where good
things happen.

367
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,511
Those things are for
sale in this country.

368
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:37,824
They can be
manufactured, if you know

369
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:38,716
how to work the machinery.

370
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,488
- I can do that.
- We can't stop moving.

371
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:43,358
We can't stop moving,
they will find us.

372
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,931
If the people we were stop
moving, they'd be found.

373
00:28:45,964 --> 00:28:48,168
But the people we're
about to become...

374
00:28:49,838 --> 00:28:51,976
No one's looking
for those people

375
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:54,815
because those people
haven't done anything wrong.

376
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:58,488
They are honest Americans

377
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:00,560
looking to work hard.

378
00:29:00,593 --> 00:29:02,898
Be happy.

379
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:04,500
Be a...

380
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,377
Be a family.

381
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,796
It's a comforting story.

382
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:22,136
This place is filled
with comforting stories.

383
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:24,507
It makes it so hard
to see the truth.

384
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:28,883
The moment we left
the mountains,

385
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,285
I think we both knew

386
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,824
there was only one way
this could all end.

387
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,997
I do not like the idea that

388
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:38,201
we're lying to
ourselves about it,

389
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,406
or to each other.

390
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:43,278
I have drawn some
comfort in knowing that

391
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:44,551
at least, when the end comes...

392
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,888
we will know we did
the right thing.

393
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:50,292
And we will be together,
and maybe that's okay,

394
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:51,996
maybe that's enough.

395
00:30:07,193 --> 00:30:08,563
Fuck that.

396
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,571
I did what I did.

397
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:16,044
And I'd do it again,
because it led to us.

398
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:19,985
I don't care what
your name is, or mine.

399
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,591
All I care about is
growing old with you.

400
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:31,374
Come be someone new with me,

401
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:33,613
and...

402
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,082
and I swear to God,
I will make sure

403
00:30:35,115 --> 00:30:38,221
that no one or nothing
will ever harm you

404
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:40,059
as long as I live.

405
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,335
Yes.

406
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:33,231
Hmm.

407
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:35,002
Wh-What, uh, what
are we gonna call

408
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:37,072
these new people
we're about to be?

409
00:31:57,213 --> 00:32:00,018
Hello,
this Harold Harper.

410
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,020
Listen, there are
a couple of things

411
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:02,691
that we need to get clear.

412
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:05,429
First, I am not running this op.

413
00:32:05,462 --> 00:32:08,201
I was asked in
strictly to consult.

414
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:11,274
No one here knows that I'm
speaking with you right now.

415
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:13,145
There's a good
chance I am violating

416
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:15,048
several laws by doing so,

417
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:17,988
which should earn me a
little latitude. Does it?

418
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:21,394
No.

419
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:24,500
All right.

420
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:26,304
The second thing, then,

421
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:28,341
is that I need you
to go to your car.

422
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,711
Right now.

423
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:32,349
I need to explain to you
how I just called you

424
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:36,090
on a phone that you believed
was clean and untraceable.

425
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:39,473
- You haven't paid yet.
- When you get to the car, take a look underneath.

426
00:32:39,497 --> 00:32:42,136
Passenger side, rear wheel well.

427
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:49,450
Apparently, we can match
the transponder's location

428
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:52,122
to the location of the
phone moving with it,

429
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:54,227
and then reverse
engineer the number.

430
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,466
That one surprised me.

431
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:59,571
I didn't know that was
a thing we could do.

432
00:33:03,846 --> 00:33:05,817
I tell you this
partly to remind you

433
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,090
that you have no idea
how different the game is

434
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:11,527
than the last time
you played it.

435
00:33:11,562 --> 00:33:13,374
And partly because you've
got about three minutes

436
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:15,435
before they're on top of you.

437
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:19,210
I'm not looking at
the transponder feed,

438
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:21,214
so let me know when
you're driving.

439
00:33:21,247 --> 00:33:22,784
We can talk further.

440
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:30,733
I'm moving.

441
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:33,769
I
understand you lost your wife.

442
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:36,511
Yeah.

443
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:38,749
Few years back.

444
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,421
- Cancer?
- Huntington's Disease.

445
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:45,162
Oh, that's... that's
awful. I'm sorry.

446
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:47,233
I appreciate that.

447
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:51,507
It's been a very long time
since I've heard your voice.

448
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:53,278
- Ah.
- Strange experience.

449
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,482
Frankly, I'd imagined
you were dead.

450
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:57,654
No.

451
00:33:57,687 --> 00:33:59,490
I just retired.

452
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:02,797
I, uh... I read about

453
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:05,703
your son and daughter-in-law
in the paper.

454
00:34:05,737 --> 00:34:07,115
-I thought about
reaching out, -Yeah.

455
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:09,110
But, uh, you know...

456
00:34:09,143 --> 00:34:11,815
I assume that you can see
the tail by now, right?

457
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,821
As far as I can tell,
these are specialists.

458
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:16,133
They're supposed
to be very good,

459
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:17,827
so I'd keep my distance.

460
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:23,839
Now, let me tell you where
I am. I'm watching about

461
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:26,578
a half a dozen high-end
contract operators

462
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:29,718
fail at blending into
Caledonia County Airfield,

463
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:32,590
loitering around
their chartered jet.

464
00:34:32,624 --> 00:34:36,130
Their op is not to kill you.

465
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:37,567
It's to retrieve you

466
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,405
and put you on that plane.

467
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:43,311
No one will tell me
where's it's headed or why,

468
00:34:43,345 --> 00:34:48,154
but as I sit here imagining
nightmare scenarios,

469
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:49,891
I'm aware that, with
a full tank of gas,

470
00:34:49,925 --> 00:34:52,697
that plane can be in
Kabul tomorrow afternoon

471
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:55,603
without touching the ground.

472
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:58,441
The nightmare scenario
is that Faraz Hamzad

473
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:02,149
wants to see you
again, and he convinced

474
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:05,122
someone in the U. S.
government to make that happen.

475
00:35:06,491 --> 00:35:09,831
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you warning me?

476
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:12,570
Because the scenario
is a nightmare for you,

477
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:14,608
but it's pretty
shitty for me, too.

478
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:17,246
This story comes back to life,
and I'm gonna have to answer

479
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,916
for some things that
were dead and buried

480
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:20,887
in the ground yesterday.

481
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,893
Right now, I'm willing to
aid and abet your escape

482
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:25,797
to prevent that.

483
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,466
Now, I know you
well enough to know

484
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:30,172
you're building a
list of options.

485
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,777
Pretty soon you're gonna
realize there are only two.

486
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,848
Number one, you engage.

487
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:37,721
Go to ground, figure
out how to fight back.

488
00:35:37,754 --> 00:35:39,758
You go through that door,
and I'm here to tell you

489
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,361
it's gonna end badly,

490
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:43,231
because the first thing
that's gonna happen is

491
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:45,235
this will become my operation,

492
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,406
and I'm gonna have
to put you down.

493
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:49,410
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

494
00:35:49,443 --> 00:35:50,747
Don't.

495
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,218
Just don't.

496
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,257
The transponder under the car.

497
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,261
You left a silencer on a guy

498
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:00,365
you tried to pass
off as a burglar.

499
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:03,405
You aren't the guy you remember.

500
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:07,346
I doubt I'd even recognize
you if I saw you right now.

501
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:09,785
Some days, I don't
recognize myself,

502
00:36:09,818 --> 00:36:13,291
but I've got 10,000 agents and
a ten billion-dollar budget

503
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:14,795
to make up for
whatever I've lost.

504
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:16,297
What have you got?

505
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,303
Mm. Maybe I have a
story worth telling.

506
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:21,407
Different time now
than it was then.

507
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:23,244
Maybe now I'm not the one

508
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:24,948
who comes off looking
like the bad guy,

509
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:27,352
and your life gets complicated.

510
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:30,425
You're not gonna do that.

511
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:32,797
Oh, really? Why?

512
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:35,837
Because she's in this now.

513
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,676
Whatever name you gave her...

514
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:42,249
wherever you put her because
you thought she'd be safe...

515
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:46,257
Your daughter is about
to be a part of this.

516
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:51,568
And I'm telling you, if you
go through door number one,

517
00:36:51,602 --> 00:36:53,706
I'm gonna use her to get to you.

518
00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:01,487
You're about to drive this to
a place you're not gonna like

519
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:03,993
- when we get there.
- You think

520
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:05,830
I like any of this?

521
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:07,801
And I'm not driving
it from the beginning.

522
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,907
It's been your choices
that have brought us here.

523
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:15,817
That brings us to
door number two.

524
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:19,323
Door number two is...

525
00:37:19,356 --> 00:37:21,327
you disappear.

526
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,331
Mm. Yeah, I did
that last time.

527
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:27,005
No. Not like last time.

528
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,642
This time, you
walk out that door

529
00:37:28,676 --> 00:37:31,380
the same way you walked
in the first one.

530
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:32,584
Alone.

531
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,057
What's gonna happen is

532
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,461
I'm gonna find your daughter

533
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:40,332
and I'm gonna tell my people,

534
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:42,904
"This is the only thread that
connects him to the world,

535
00:37:42,937 --> 00:37:45,342
the only piece of him
that we have a hold on."

536
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:49,450
"So let's just sit," I'll
say, "and watch her and wait,

537
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:52,022
and eventually he'll call."

538
00:37:52,055 --> 00:37:53,959
And you never will.

539
00:37:55,395 --> 00:37:58,034
No. No, no.

540
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,372
Harold...

541
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:02,476
-If you do call, -Harold.

542
00:38:02,509 --> 00:38:04,915
If you reach out
to her in any way,

543
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:07,754
there will be agents
at her door in minutes.

544
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,089
They'll question her.

545
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:10,769
I-If she knows about
crimes you've committed,

546
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:12,362
she's going to jail.

547
00:38:12,396 --> 00:38:14,300
It could get worse from there.

548
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,408
You disappear.

549
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:20,378
She lives her life.

550
00:38:20,412 --> 00:38:23,051
And this story goes back into
the ground where I left it.

551
00:38:27,092 --> 00:38:28,394
Fuck you.

552
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,906
You got 30 good years with her.

553
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:35,943
That's 30 more than
it could've been,

554
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:38,682
and you get to say
goodbye to her.

555
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,586
That's not something
that's guaranteed.

556
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,922
Trust me.

557
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:45,128
As long as you stay away,

558
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,932
she'll never even
know I'm there.

559
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:48,401
From where I sit,
that sounds like

560
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:50,505
a pretty good outcome
for all of us.

561
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:54,380
I gave you a head
start. Take it.

562
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:56,985
Lose the tail. Disappear.

563
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:59,456
You and I both get to spend
whatever years we have left

564
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:03,031
on this earth pretending
we never knew each other.

565
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,437
And that none of
this ever happened.

566
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:29,684
He's on the move.

567
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:33,124
Yeah, I can see that.

568
00:39:33,157 --> 00:39:36,130
Just minutes before we
arrived on target, too.

569
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:38,802
That's unfortunate.

570
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,478
You were just on the
phone out there, yeah?

571
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:45,583
Yes, I was.

572
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,121
May I ask who it was
you were talking to?

573
00:39:48,154 --> 00:39:49,724
No, you may not.

574
00:39:53,064 --> 00:39:56,437
Son, do you know what my
position is at the FBI?

575
00:39:57,573 --> 00:39:59,143
Yes, sir.

576
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:00,822
Do you think I was
appointed to that position

577
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:03,585
because I'm someone
it's safe to fuck with?

578
00:40:04,788 --> 00:40:07,492
- No, sir.
- Then quit staring at me,

579
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:09,998
before I start getting the
idea I'm being fucked with.

580
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:12,971
Deal?

581
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:17,545
Yeah.

582
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,744
Hello?

583
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:35,916
- Hey, it's me.
- Hey. Are you okay?

584
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,922
- I thought we were offline for a while.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

585
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:41,260
Listen, uh...

586
00:40:41,293 --> 00:40:44,534
We never talked about this...

587
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,504
before, this, uh,

588
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:50,211
this eventuality,
because, well...

589
00:40:50,245 --> 00:40:54,219
I never honestly thought
we'd ever have to,

590
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:56,892
but, uh...

591
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:00,933
Shit.

592
00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:03,639
Dad, wh... wh-what
are you talking about?

593
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,849
I've got to go away, sweetheart.

594
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:11,955
- Yeah. No.
- Well, y-you said that before.

595
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:13,692
- Yeah.
- I don't understand.

596
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,763
- Away. Away, away.
- What's changed?

597
00:41:15,796 --> 00:41:17,567
For good.

598
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,539
You and I, we're not gonna
be able to talk again.

599
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,844
Not for a long time.

600
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:25,816
Well, maybe not at all.

601
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:30,091
Why?

602
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:33,932
Oh, I thought I'd
covered the tracks.

603
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:36,103
You know, I thought
that you were insulated,

604
00:41:36,137 --> 00:41:37,707
no matter what happened to me.

605
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,113
Even if I had to move again,
at least you'd be safe.

606
00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:43,952
But I don't think I
can be in your life,

607
00:41:43,986 --> 00:41:46,925
not even as a voice on a
phone, and keep you safe now.

608
00:41:53,137 --> 00:41:55,576
But may... well, maybe this is

609
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:57,121
where this was always
headed, you know?

610
00:41:57,145 --> 00:41:58,314
Maybe this was...

611
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:03,759
this was it. This...

612
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:07,600
being able to say
goodbye on our own terms.

613
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:10,305
Yeah, maybe that's what
this was always about.

614
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:16,350
I'm sorry.

615
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:19,256
Remember that I love you.

616
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:24,901
That I'll always love you,
but I think I got to go now.

617
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:26,270
Em?

618
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:31,013
Emily?

619
00:42:35,155 --> 00:42:37,827
It'd help if I could
hear you say goodbye.

620
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:43,237
Em?

621
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:49,316
Fuck that.

622
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:50,418
Excuse me?

623
00:42:52,022 --> 00:42:55,395
I believe that things
have taken a turn.

624
00:42:55,428 --> 00:42:58,067
I believe that the way
forward is more dangerous

625
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,140
than it was yesterday,
but I do not believe

626
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:03,788
- that there is nothing else you can do about it but run.
- I... I-I don't...

627
00:43:03,812 --> 00:43:05,816
I don't have time to
argue this, Emily.

628
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,361
You're gonna have to
take my word for it.

629
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,657
- What are you afraid of?
- What am I afraid of?

630
00:43:09,691 --> 00:43:10,960
You heard me.

631
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:13,364
I'm afraid someone's
gonna find you,

632
00:43:13,397 --> 00:43:15,803
torture you and kill
you to get to me.

633
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:17,807
- They frightened you with that?
- I don't know,

634
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,211
that sounds pretty goddamn
frightening to me, Emily.

635
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:21,948
Well, then frighten them back.

636
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:24,353
You've told me what
you used to do.

637
00:43:24,386 --> 00:43:26,801
- I mean, you've told me what you're capable of.
- I... I told you

638
00:43:26,825 --> 00:43:28,427
some of what I used to do.

639
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:30,966
I wanted you to come home from
school at the end of the day.

640
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,770
If I'd told you
everything I used to do,

641
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:35,375
I'm not sure you
would've wanted to.

642
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:37,680
You don't know how ugly
these things can get

643
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:39,651
when they get ugly, Em.

644
00:43:40,753 --> 00:43:44,727
You have no idea what
I did, who I was,

645
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:47,098
and at this point in my life,
I want to keep it that way.

646
00:43:47,132 --> 00:43:48,769
Who do you think I am?

647
00:43:48,802 --> 00:43:50,706
- Who do you think raised me?
- And you...

648
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:53,244
- Why would you think I can't handle ugly things?
- Emily.

649
00:43:53,277 --> 00:43:56,818
You have no idea what it's
like to watch somebody you love

650
00:43:56,852 --> 00:43:58,354
become somebody you can't.

651
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:00,793
There are things that
you can't unknow, Em.

652
00:44:00,826 --> 00:44:01,862
You can't unsee.

653
00:44:01,895 --> 00:44:03,331
And I will not have that be

654
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:05,335
the way you remember
me when I'm gone.

655
00:44:05,368 --> 00:44:07,038
I just won't.

656
00:44:10,044 --> 00:44:12,015
- I'm out of time, sweetheart.
- N-No.

657
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:13,752
Don't-don't make this about me,

658
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:15,756
'cause I'm-I'm not
afraid to know you.

659
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,425
I'm s... I'm sorry,
but I got to go.

660
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:19,096
I don't have time to argue this.

661
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:21,267
No. Don't-don't you
hang up this phone.

662
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,004
Don't you give up on me.

663
00:44:23,037 --> 00:44:25,341
- I love you, Emily.
- No, Daddy, don't... -

664
00:44:42,944 --> 00:44:45,248
Do you
still have contact?

665
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:46,985
Standby, please.

666
00:44:51,828 --> 00:44:53,331
He's headed
off the main road,

667
00:44:53,364 --> 00:44:54,834
an access road, maybe.

668
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:57,339
About 80 yards.

669
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:14,907
He's stopped.

670
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:17,012
200 yards ahead.

671
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,522
Do you have a visual?

672
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:25,061
Negative. I don't see...

673
00:45:25,094 --> 00:45:26,330
Wait.

674
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,236
Shit.

675
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,441
Have them sweep the area.

676
00:45:48,474 --> 00:45:50,478
- He can't have gotten far.
Copy.

677
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:56,490
You have an opinion, sir?

678
00:45:57,893 --> 00:46:00,198
My opinion is that
you missed him twice.

679
00:46:01,935 --> 00:46:04,206
You're never gonna
see that man again.

680
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:14,192
Sweep
the area, scan for tracks.

681
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:16,564
- Anything we can find.
- Yep.

682
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:23,144
What?

683
00:46:23,177 --> 00:46:25,148
We just got shook
by a senior citizen.

684
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:26,581
I got to imagine
we're gonna hear...

685
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,027
Come here.

686
00:48:45,061 --> 00:48:46,296
- Come here.

687
00:49:35,094 --> 00:49:36,698
Oh! Oh!

688
00:49:55,101 --> 00:49:56,538
Aah!

689
00:50:12,502 --> 00:50:15,776
Oh! Oh...

690
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:16,531
Man, who the hell are you?

691
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,802
Yeah.

692
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:10,939
I have him. En route.

693
00:52:10,972 --> 00:52:14,212
Copy that. ETA?

694
00:52:14,245 --> 00:52:16,416
0100, give or take.

695
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:18,755
Reynolds is dead.

696
00:52:18,788 --> 00:52:20,625
I couldn't retrieve
the body at the scene.

697
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:22,228
Yeah.

698
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:24,199
- But the target is in hand.

699
00:52:24,232 --> 00:52:25,936
The situation is under control.

700
00:52:30,545 --> 00:52:32,916
I'm sending you exact GPS
for the target's vehicle

701
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,987
and Reynolds' body.

702
00:52:51,554 --> 00:52:54,560
Check in every 15. Out.

703
00:53:12,462 --> 00:53:13,865
- Fuck you looking at?

704
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:41,072
Aah! Fuck.

705
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:17,445
Oh! Oh, fuck.

706
00:55:19,515 --> 00:55:21,988
Ow.

707
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:23,558
Oh...

708
00:55:29,102 --> 00:55:31,841
Fuck you, old man.

709
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:33,678
Try that shit again.

710
00:55:42,495 --> 00:55:43,865
Fass.

711
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:55,622
Huh? No.

712
00:55:55,655 --> 00:55:57,759
- No. No!

713
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,174
Is he there?

714
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,212
Harper.

715
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,061
It's for you.

716
00:57:29,643 --> 00:57:31,647
Yeah?

717
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,185
That's three.

718
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:35,789
Any more you send at me,

719
00:57:35,822 --> 00:57:37,859
I'm sending back in bags.

720
00:57:38,895 --> 00:57:41,600
Anyone you send at my kid,

721
00:57:41,634 --> 00:57:44,072
I'm sending back in pieces.

722
00:57:48,113 --> 00:57:50,785
Do you recognize me now?

723
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:21,881
Who the hell is this guy?

724
00:58:24,052 --> 00:58:26,557
Sir, what am I
dealing with here?

725
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,306
Hey.

726
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:53,544
It's your dad.
