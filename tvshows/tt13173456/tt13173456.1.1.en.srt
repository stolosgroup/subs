<i>Command, this is Coyote Six.</i>

00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:22,166
<i>We're 70 miles northwest of the base.

You're cleared to land on Runway Three.</i>

<i>maximum two-niner-seven-four inches,

00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,666
<i>Mayday! We're hit!</i>

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,958
<i>- Losing altitude.</i>
- Shit.

10
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,625
Command, this is Mad Dogs.
We have visual on Alpha Two,

11
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,875
<i>and it's going down.</i>

12
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,708
<i>Coordinates 4-2 Sierra Whiskey

13
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,833
Tell the other units to stand by.

14
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,791
Team Three, Team Six,
this is Command. Stand by.

15
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:55,875
Wait, what?

16
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,083
<i>I repeat,
Team Three and Team Six,</i>

17
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:01,046
<i>- stand by and wait for orders.</i>
- Take us down! We're gonna check it out.

18
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,291
Sir, the militia's
converging on the crash site.

19
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,041
Alpha Two's under attack.
They're totally surrounded.

20
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,291
<i>Command, got eyes on Alpha Two.
Preparing to engage.</i>

21
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,166
Negative.
You are to stand by. Do not engage.

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,083
- They're firing on the enemy.
- What unit is that?

23
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,333
Mad Dogs, sir.

24
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,875
Goddammit. Tell them to stand down
and get back in formation!

25
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,958
Command to Mad Dogs. Stand down,

26
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,767
<i>- return to formation!</i>
- When we hit the deck,

27
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,958
we light 'em up with the SAWs,
then we go for survivors. Got it?

28
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,125
<i>Command to Mad Dogs,
stand down and return to formation!</i>

29
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,713
- Clear!
- Bastards took our guys!

30
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,666
- Fuck.
- One here.

31
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,625
US Army Mad Dogs, can you move?

32
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,666
Oh, shit.

33
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,208
Okay. He's still alive.

34
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,750
Hey.

35
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,791
I'm Claire.

36
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,750
Claire Redfield.

37
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,750
What's your name?

38
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,416
Remotsu…

39
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,333
Ganape?

40
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,625
Okay. Guess I'm gonna have
to learn the language a little better.

41
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,916
No, Ms. Claire.
This child is mute.

42
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,958
He cannot speak.

43
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,083
What?

44
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,791
He was in the civil war.

45
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,541
He cannot speak.

46
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,125
Oh, man.

47
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,208
The things you've probably seen.

48
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,250
Well…

49
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,416
if you're here…

50
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,333
then you're safe.

51
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,166
I'll make sure of it.

52
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,083
Do you like to draw?

53
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,458
Can I see?

54
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,583
Oh, my God.

55
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,416
Did you see this?

56
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:18,041
<i>Delta, Charlie, 2-0-2-1-7,
this is the Ace of Spades.</i>

57
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,375
<i>You're cleared to land on Runway 0-1.</i>

58
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,500
<i>Wind, 30 at five knots.</i>

59
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,958
Thirty minutes should do.
The President's scheduled…

60
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,041
…an emergency call from a congressman.

61
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,416
I'm sure that can wait till later.

62
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,833
You're the third agent?

63
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,583
Where's the fourth?
There's supposed to be four of us.

64
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,000
Leon should be on his way.

65
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,250
Leon?

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,041
Leon, as in the guy who saved
the President's daughter?

67
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,125
Yep.

68
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,041
That Leon. He's more than qualified.

69
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,000
Qualified?

70
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,958
More like lucky.
The only reason he's the golden boy now

71
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,750
is because he was
in the wrong place at the right time.

72
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,958
He successfully handled
dozens of critical missions.

73
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,875
In fact, he's on his way here
from that terror attack in Pittsburgh.

74
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,875
- Like I said...
- In this line of work,

75
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,875
luck doesn't solve problems.

76
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,250
Skills do.

77
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,458
The President's ready. Come on.

78
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,166
It's an honor to be working
with the hero of Penamstan.

79
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,958
Hero?

80
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,875
Yeah.

81
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:41,833
<i>Copy. Runway 01.
Wind, 30 at five knots.</i>

82
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,166
Never gotten clearance
to land that fast before.

83
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,416
You must be special.

84
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,583
Unauthorized access?

85
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,333
Right. Someone was trying
to get confidential files

86
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,041
pertaining to the President.

87
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,631
Presidential Aide Ryan
and three agents

88
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,416
have just entered the Oval Office.

89
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,791
Roger that. How's the West Wing look?

90
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:15,875
All's well, sir.

91
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,528
Thank you for waiting, gentlemen.

92
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,642
One agent is still en route, but these
three are probably the most qualified...

93
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,906
Please. Let's get this started.

94
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,375
Defense Secretary Wilson?

95
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:28,666
Yesterday, we received an alert
that one of our servers was compromised.

96
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,291
It contains
the Pentagon's military secrets

97
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,958
and other files that are
highly sensitive in nature.

98
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:38,291
Normally, an authorization code
from the President is required to log on.

99
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,291
But, somehow, they bypassed that step.

100
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,083
Why is top-secret data
on a server with outside access?

101
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,958
It can't be accessed externally.

102
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,875
The server's on
a 100 percent local network.

103
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,208
Then it was an inside job.

104
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,041
We've looked through all
the surveillance footage from every angle.

105
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,833
We haven't locked down any suspects yet.

106
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,250
So until we do, everyone who entered
or left the White House in the 24 hours

107
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,375
before or after the hack is a suspect.

108
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,666
Guess that rules us three out.

109
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,375
We'd like you to find and apprehend
the person who broke into the server.

110
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,666
I suppose we should start by having
a look at the surveillance footage.

111
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,708
That'll take days.
We should get someone else to do that.

112
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,625
Actually, I have my suspicions.

113
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,833
Oh, god, not this again.

114
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,500
China has been waging a cyberwar
against this country for years now.

115
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:33,250
Putting our government, our military,
and our citizens all at risk.

116
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,541
- The internet is only the first stage.
- Secretary.

117
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,666
Making blind assumptions
will only make things worse.

118
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,625
We don't know it was them.
We don't know anything yet.

119
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,750
Hundreds of people
come and go here every day.

120
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,666
You and your family, Mr. President.

121
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,875
The staff, dignitaries, tours.

122
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,518
Even the gardeners. It could be anybody...

123
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,625
What's going on?

124
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,750
- Quiet!
- Everyone down!

125
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,166
Longhorn's secure.
Bring the Beast around.

126
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,625
What the hell?

127
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,958
Why isn't the backup power coming on?

128
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,625
Even if we go manual,
we can only get the emergency lights.

129
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,226
- Check it now.
- Must've been a surge.

130
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,791
- This is the chief. What's going on?
- East Wing's gone dark!

131
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,166
Does anyone copy?

132
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,791
Does anyone know
what's happening here?

133
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,458
This is no accident.

134
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,333
I'm going to take a look outside.

135
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,500
- Patrick, with me.
- Roger that.

136
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,583
Everybody, stay calm!

137
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,833
Get back to your offices,
lock the doors, and stand by.

138
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,875
Press Secretary Spacer!
What happened?

139
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't know.

140
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,041
It got dark and I…

141
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,833
I got hit from behind.

142
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,583
Did you see who it was?
Did they take anything?

143
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,083
No.

144
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,375
I've got Press Secretary Spacer with me.

145
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,333
He's injured.

146
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,500
He's got a head wound, but he's conscious.
He says he was attacked.

147
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,726
- What's going on?
- Somebody hit him.

148
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,500
I've got to take care of that wound.

149
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,328
- Get to it. I'm checking upstairs.
- Right.

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,250
Mr. Spacer. Mr. Spacer, sir!

151
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,333
What's wrong?

152
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,041
Secretary Spacer's
going into cardiac arrest.

153
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,625
I'm getting the AED.

154
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,541
Mr. Spacer?

155
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,333
Stand down, or I'll shoot!

156
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,291
Leon?

157
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,166
Shoot them in the head. That stops them.

158
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,166
Come on.

159
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,458
SWAT's en route.

160
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,541
They can deal with the zombies up here
and getting the power back up.

161
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,916
We'll head to the bunker.

162
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,166
- Are they really zombies?
- Yes, sir.

163
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,875
Sorry, I didn't get here sooner.

164
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,750
Not at all. I'm indebted to you
for getting my daughter, Ashley, back.

165
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,833
Besides, with you here,
we just might survive this.

166
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,541
I never thought what happened
at Raccoon City could happen here.

167
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,625
We all ready?

168
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,041
Let's get the President
to the bunker. Stay sharp out there.

169
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,885
Come on, sir.

170
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,708
Why are they here?

171
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:34,833
Patrick, stay with the President.
Leon, Shen May, with me.

172
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,675
I'm counting
on those skills of yours.

173
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,333
Hey.

174
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,208
You good?

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,708
Ye... Yeah.

176
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,208
I'm just a little freaked out.
I've never seen…

177
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,875
zombies before.

178
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,166
Thanks for back there.

179
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,083
Okay.

180
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,125
Anything even
remotely hostile gets a headshot.

181
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,083
Whatever you do,
don't let them reach the bunker.

182
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,541
Understood?

183
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,708
Right.

184
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,416
Rest in peace, assholes.

185
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,833
Think it's the T-Virus?

186
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,625
We won't know till the lab checks it out.

187
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,875
More important question is,

188
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,541
how the hell did zombies
get in the White House?

189
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,333
Hmm.

190
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,083
And who's behind it?

191
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:55,416
Uh, Mr. Ryan, I work with TerraSave,
the NGO assisting the Penamstanis.

192
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,625
Do you have a moment?

193
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,708
What is it?

194
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,500
I can't find Press Secretary Spacer.
Do you know where he might be?

195
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,083
- Eh, he's on leave right now.
- "On leave"?

196
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,375
But I have an appointment with him.

197
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,666
I don't know what to tell you.
Perhaps you mixed up your dates.

198
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,666
He's not here.
I'm sorry, I… I have another appointment.

199
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,875
Uh, Leon?

200
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,291
Claire?

201
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,333
What're you doing here?

202
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,458
I'm here with reps
from Penamstan's provisional government.

203
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,750
Just trying to get some schools
and hospitals built.

204
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,166
Penamstan?

205
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,291
Yeah.
The US wants a military presence there,

206
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,250
so there's supposed to be some sort
of signing ceremony next week.

207
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,666
Um, hey, actually,
could you take a look at something?

208
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,166
Yeah, sure. What's this?

209
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,916
A little boy drew them.

210
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,208
They're what the civil war
looked like six years ago.

211
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,000
Doesn't that look
a lot like Raccoon City?

212
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,833
I can't get anyone to go on record
about what happened there.

213
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,166
But after seeing those, I mean,
it's gotta be another outbreak.

214
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:13,083
- Hmm.
- Leon. Clock's ticking. Let's move.

215
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:15,875
Wait.

216
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:20,000
Isn't that the guy everyone calls
"the hero of Penamstan"?

217
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,250
In the flesh.

218
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,500
Look, I gotta go.

219
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't do anything stupid.

220
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,291
Excuse me.

221
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,125
Hey, Leon.

222
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,541
That outfit doesn't suit you.

223
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,926
It's the only way
to deal with this.

224
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,666
Mr. President, the DIA
finished their analysis of the hacking.

225
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,875
The files accessed
were classified documents regarding China.

226
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,583
- China.
- Yes.

227
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,708
They contained intel
on a bio-research facility in Shanghai

228
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,541
we had flagged for surveillance.

229
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,041
Bio-research facility?

230
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,625
I suggest we send Jason
and his team to investigate.

231
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,750
With your approval, of course.

232
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,708
Now, wait just a minute.

233
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,125
We don't want to provoke the Chinese.

234
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,375
Besides, we can't send anyone in,
without talking to DHS, the CIA, and...

235
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,458
Mr. President!

236
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,541
First, there was the hacking,
then this outbreak in the White House!

237
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,291
The White House, for God's sake!

238
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,916
We are under attack!

239
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,666
Fine.

240
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Set it up.

241
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,208
<i>She's a modified Virginia-class,
with an upgraded ASDS onboard.</i>

242
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,875
We're going to sneak right in
under the East Sea Fleet's nose,

243
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,041
load your team onto the DS, and launch it.

244
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,791
You'll make your rendezvous
without them even knowing it.

245
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:07,875
Yes, sir, this little lady's outfitted
with stealth tech that's best-in-class.

246
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,541
I've been itching for an op
like this to try it out.

247
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,250
Remember, when we're running silent,
shut your holes.

248
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,125
I don't want this turning
into some global…

249
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,375
Take us out.

250
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,458
Make your depth one-five feet,
five-degree down bubble.

251
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,291
One-five feet,
five-degree down bubble. Aye, sir.

252
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,958
Okay, where we at?

253
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,375
All right.

254
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,250
Our mission is to infiltrate
the bio-research facility

255
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,213
and seize any evidence
pertaining to the hacking

256
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,291
and the viral terrorist attack
at the White House.

257
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,095
I'll brief you further
when we get to shore.

258
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,750
We could just hack them.
What's the point of even going?

259
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,458
Sorry, champ. That's classified for now.

260
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,666
Details on the facility?

261
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,875
For now, classified.

262
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,541
Time limit?

263
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,541
- Classified.
- "Classified." Right.

264
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,375
Well, I'm going
to go check the gear.

265
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,083
Get some shut-eye.

266
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,416
Fantastic.

267
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,250
You wanna get dinner
when this is all over?

268
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,208
Sure, but full disclosure,
I have a young man waiting for me.

269
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,333
So…

270
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,458
So, it's classified.

271
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,166
For now.

271
00:21:36,305 --> 00:22:36,760
