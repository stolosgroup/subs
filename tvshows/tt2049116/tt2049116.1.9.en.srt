00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:55,717
--Hello.
--When you come only now?

3
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:58,757
--It looks like this.
--Kl. 12 Danie.

4
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:13,517
What should I do?
--Enduring Calm be tested.

5
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:16,917
--It should be clear tonight.
--Okay.

6
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:21,237
We will make an arts center
which improves the range ...

7
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:27,557
Michele, you're bored.
Relax. You're the mayor now.

8
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:30,877
We know it's important. Especially for us.

9
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:37,197
--How do we organize ourselves?
--Your company, our work.

10
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:41,597
I promised a lot
For an idiot.

11
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:45,477
--We keep bio and bowling.
--I hear Conte.

12
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:48,997
--But it's probably not a problem.
--Good.

13
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:53,277
We have a problem.
The brothers Romano.

14
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:55,837
Car dealers?

15
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:59,877
Their store is located in the area.

16
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:04,477
Where is he? You should fix it.

17
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:11,277
I've been there. Do not touch
the. It belonged to their late father.

18
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:19,037
Can you handle it, Ciro?

19
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:23,757
--I got it.
--Then it's settled.

20
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:59,797
--He hits his head one day.
--He's too obtuse.

21
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:03,517
--Who is it?
--A fool in love.

22
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:06,077
--Is not he cute?
--Jo.

23
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:16,317
And?

24
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:19,317
Gennaro Savastano thinks he's God.

25
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:23,917
--He thinks he is like his father.
--Genny is close to Conte ...

26
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,677
... and the other families.
When he stops?

27
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:30,757
Tonino! Toni ...

28
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:36,597
How did Don Salvatore that?

29
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:40,637
I know where he is.
He prays and works.

30
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:43,317
Is he happy?

31
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:47,237
Who's not happy?
--I am happy.

32
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:50,557
We should all be happy.

33
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:53,837
Greet him.

34
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,677
Now we, Rosario.

35
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:24,357
--Ciro looking for you.
--Now?

36
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:30,917
--Want me to walk again?
--No, it's something else.

37
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,797
I'm coming.

38
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:39,157
--What do you mean?
--Get off me.

39
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:44,837
--I pay you to work.
--My uncle says that Mommy is sick.

40
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:49,837
Relax.
The scooter is ready in the morning.

41
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:23,997
--Should I shoot?
--One thing at a time.

42
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:27,957
Go out and have fun. Here you go.

43
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:31,197
Shall we go out tonight?

44
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:34,837
Are you gay or what?
I have a family.

45
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:39,877
--Do not have a girlfriend?
--Of course. Watch.

46
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:43,317
--Can I see.
--Her name is Manu.

47
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:51,197
--Is not she beautiful?
Yes, she is.

48
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:56,517
Sex Manu.
You should do something important tomorrow.

49
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:59,877
--Anything for you, Ciro.
--Go now.

50
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:07,997
--Yes.
--Come on down.

51
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,637
Why?
--We go for a walk.

52
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:15,317
--I must not be the father.
--It will not be late.

53
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:20,037
--I have school tomorrow.
--Come, I give the pizza.

54
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:23,877
--I'll talk to your father.
--Clear.

55
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:26,717
Okay. See you tomorrow?

56
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:47,717
--You have not been home for two weeks.
--I have to work, Mom.

57
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:50,357
--Stay.
--It does not.

58
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:54,637
I'm going to Marbella.
Otherwise, the boss mad.

59
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:56,797
Conte. A hell of a laborer.

60
00:09:56,877 --> 00:10:01,037
--Come on. You do not know him.
--I know what you're doing.

61
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:04,357
Stop that. See you never know.

62
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,757
And when I see you, you cry.
Come on, Mom.

63
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:15,477
I'll be back soon.
I promise.

64
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:20,877
Goodbye, Mom.

65
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:43,317
Brother.

66
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:47,637
--How are you?
--Good. And the job?

67
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:51,237
Fine. The boss likes me.

68
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,037
--He says I will get very far.
--Maybe you courier.

69
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:58,037
--Are you kidding?
--I? No, never.

70
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:02,637
You want a battle?
What are you doing, man?

71
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:13,917
I have to go. Take care of mom.
She seems exhausted.

72
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:18,877
--Do not do anything stupid.
--Calm down.

73
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:21,477
Hello, Danie.

74
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:51,397
There he is. Now we do it.

75
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,837
BR×´DRENE ROMANOS Car Dealers

76
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:42,677
Go.

77
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,477
Ciro.

78
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:12,517
--Hello.
And?

79
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:18,237
I've been taking care of the brothers Romano.

80
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:22,557
You know what Dad said Toni?
I have war in his head.

81
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:26,197
But he has a head for war.

82
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:28,957
And what does it mean Gennaro?

83
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:32,997
That you are a skilled soldier.

84
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:39,277
Thank you, Ciro.

85
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:46,357
Tell Salvatore
that we do what it takes.

86
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:02,997
I dedicate birthday
next song. Congratulations.

87
00:14:08,477 --> 00:14:12,077
Have you heard
Capaebomba has been Piscinola?

88
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:14,157
Really?

89
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:17,557
He's 19 years.
What will you do about it?

90
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:23,077
Nothing. We have always fought
Don Pietro and we are still here.

91
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:28,357
Fortunately. we were able to
have ended up as Attilio and the others.

92
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:46,837
The idiot.
He says that I am a soldier.

93
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:54,117
--Soldiers only go to war.
--Do you go alone in the war?

94
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:59,637
Alone? Are not you with me?

95
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:05,517
Of course I am.

96
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:11,517
At the orphanage
the nuns used to say:

97
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:16,197
"Earthquakes are good for the earth."

98
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:20,837
"They're like one
who are unhappy. "

99
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:26,317
It gets worse
and worse until it erupts ...

100
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:29,957
... or die.

101
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:33,877
Therefore, the excellent earthquake.

102
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:42,877
Call Danielino,
he must be something important.

103
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:39,997
Danie!

104
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:43,557
What do you think about the trip
to the concessionaire?

105
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:46,877
Nothing. It's not my business.

106
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:50,997
Were not you scared?

107
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:56,237
You'd probably be scared
if you were to shoot.

108
00:16:56,317 --> 00:17:00,237
--Are you asking me to shoot?
--Can you do it?

109
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:04,277
--I do not know.
Can you? Can I see?

110
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,397
Here. Show me what you can.

111
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:14,437
Look at that.

112
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:19,477
Are you in a movie or what?
Hold it right. Also the head.

113
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:24,317
Are you ready?

114
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:26,877
Shoot.

115
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:34,317
The arm should be straight.
That's it. Absolutely quiet.

116
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:38,357
Hold your breath.

117
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:43,477
Now.

118
00:17:50,197 --> 00:17:54,397
--I hit.
--One out of two. It's good.

119
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:57,757
--Can I try again.
--Do you like it?

120
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:02,517
It is enough.

121
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:07,277
Do you only shoot bottles?

122
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:11,437
Or would you shoot right?

123
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:15,637
It's something else to shoot
a human. You must close.

124
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,917
You may be afraid, Danie.

125
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:23,717
Do you get scared?

126
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,837
Good.

127
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,517
It is he.

128
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:57,277
Can you see him?

129
00:18:57,357 --> 00:19:00,837
Who is it? What has he done?

130
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:05,717
It is not.
One who does not pay the debt.

131
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:07,917
His name Tonino Russo.

132
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:11,117
We have spoken to him,
but he sums up nothing.

133
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:17,077
Now Gennaro furious.
He says that it is enough.

134
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:26,317
--It will happen tomorrow night.
--Tomorrow night?

135
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:32,557
When there is no,
you come and do it.

136
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:35,437
And going straight home. Are you in?

137
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:41,317
Direct home. So you call me,
and then we take the city.

138
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:50,397
--Are you about to shit your pants?
--I? Never.

139
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:56,797
I believe in you.
I know you'll make it.

140
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:01,557
But no one knows it. No one.

141
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,837
Here is an advance.

142
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,077
Take them.

143
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:13,997
You get the rest later.

144
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:24,397
It is only the beginning.

145
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:28,357
Come, we go.

146
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,557
--Trak, look who's here.
Give me another one.

147
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:12,277
--Look how tall he is.
What?

148
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:15,837
You're quite high.
Give me another one.

149
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,957
--Do.
--Shut up. Gab up.

150
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:21,757
He loves it.

151
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:31,477
--Daniele. How are you?
--Great.

152
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:34,717
--Who are you here with?
--Some friends.

153
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:37,837
--Okay.
--With Genny Savastano?

154
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:40,877
--I work for him now.
--Do you?

155
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,477
I present to you.

156
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:51,397
Genny. I would
introduce you to a friend.

157
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,117
--Nice.
--Nice. Bruno.

158
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:58,237
What are you doing to him?

159
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,677
What do you think?

160
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:14,157
Come here, you fool.

161
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:35,837
--You have dirty hands.
--I wash them all the time.

162
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:42,277
--But they smell good.
--Your are really dirty.

163
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:06,397
Now you're fine.
What would you do without me?

164
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:14,557
What are you doing?
--Do you want to be together tonight?

165
00:23:14,637 --> 00:23:18,397
--How?
--Come on. I want you.

166
00:23:20,117 --> 00:23:24,357
Not tonight.
But dad is not home in the morning.

167
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:32,117
--What is it? Are not you glad?
--Jo.

168
00:24:02,437 --> 00:24:07,277
Good. A ring of red gold
with genuine diamonds.

169
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:10,757
--Okay. It's really nice.
--Perfect.

170
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,037
--I pay cash.
--Fine.

171
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:40,397
Come in.

172
00:24:43,197 --> 00:24:46,397
--Are you ready?
--Yes.

173
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:56,637
Once you have killed him
you should throw it away.

174
00:24:56,717 --> 00:25:00,357
Drive slowly,
if you have it on the motorcycle.

175
00:25:00,437 --> 00:25:05,797
If you are stopped
all hell breaks loose, you know?

176
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:10,317
Speaking of motorcycles,
so I had promised you one.

177
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:20,197
Are you happy?

178
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:25,437
Hurry. Off you go.

179
00:27:47,637 --> 00:27:50,397
Toni!

180
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:39,717
Danie, what is it?

181
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:43,397
Nothing. It's cold.

182
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:46,437
Do not like it?

183
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:49,277
I really like it.

184
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:06,157
Look what I found.

185
00:30:17,837 --> 00:30:22,317
--This is for you.
--Is it true?

186
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:24,997
--Would you marry me?
You're mad.

187
00:30:25,077 --> 00:30:27,997
Reply. Will you marry me?

188
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,717
Yes.

189
00:30:38,117 --> 00:30:42,517
<i> Overfaldsm×ndene

197
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:12,117
Wait a minute.

198
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:19,157
You could have said,
who it was.

199
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:24,357
For that you should not
feel the pressure.

200
00:31:24,437 --> 00:31:26,317
Where are you?

201
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:30,037
On Domiziana
by Castelvolturno with Manu.

202
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:33,397
Why?
Why did not you go home?

203
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:37,117
--I could not be at home.
--Okay.

204
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:42,757
Listen. Go home immediately.

205
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:46,917
So you get 500 euros.

206
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:51,757
It is better that. I'm waiting for you.

207
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:09,957
I have to go. I'll call you later.

208
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:13,037
Would you just leave me here?

209
00:32:13,117 --> 00:32:15,877
I'll get you later.

210
00:33:02,957 --> 00:33:05,797
Shall we wait all night?
--Are you busy?

211
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:09,117
--I'm just asking.
--We expect little.

212
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:13,077
And when we find him?
--We take it easy.

213
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:20,437
--We should not scare him.
--We get him to laugh.

214
00:33:43,677 --> 00:33:46,837
--What's up?
Can you pick up my girlfriend?

215
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,637
--Your girlfriend?
--Her name is Manu.

216
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:52,797
She is in front of Bar Italia on Domiziana.

217
00:33:55,037 --> 00:33:58,757
Manu. Do not worry.
Everything is as it should be.

218
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:02,557
My friend Bruno
coming to get you.

219
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:07,357
I can not say more now.
You get his number.

220
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:11,197
Now I turn off the phone. Hey.

221
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:17,477
I'm fucked.
They will kill me.

222
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:20,357
What the hell have you done?

223
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:25,157
Ciro Di Marzio told me
kill one. An important person.

224
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:28,117
I would not know.

225
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:34,277
Help me, Bruno.
Do you have a place I can sleep?

226
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:37,677
I would not be involved.

227
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:44,997
Do you remember my grandmother's place?
There is an abrasive tool.

228
00:34:45,077 --> 00:34:49,597
The key of the door frame.
But only one night, okay?

229
00:34:49,677 --> 00:34:52,437
Thank you, Bruno.

230
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:57,197
You have not talked to me.
Not a word.

231
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:09,997
<i> There are currently
no contact to the subscriber. </ i>

232

233
00:36:11,877 --> 00:36:14,837
Bruno, it is Manu, Daniele's boyfriend.

234
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:18,037
I wait in front of Bar Italia.

235
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:43,677
Bruno, where are you?
I'm still waiting.

236
00:37:48,837 --> 00:37:53,317
--Are you Manu, Daniele's boyfriend?
--Are you Bruno?

237
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:56,517
Yes, I am. Jump into.

238
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:36,077
Where is Daniele?

239
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,317
Maybe you
not understood the question.

240
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:50,917
Where's Daniele?
--I do not know.

241
00:38:50,997 --> 00:38:54,477
So I ask again.

242
00:38:54,557 --> 00:38:57,637
Where is Daniele?

243
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:01,997
--I do not know.
You know it.

244
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:08,437
Of course you know.

245
00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:11,837
You know it. You know it.

246
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:20,237
Where the hell is he?

247
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:27,997
Are you home?
Yes or no? Where the hell is he?

248
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,437
<i> Where is he? </ i>

249
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:10,877
Where is Manu? Did not she?

250
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:15,397
My phone ran out.
And she was not where you said.

251
00:40:17,317 --> 00:40:21,237
You have to go now. I'm scared shitless.

252
00:40:26,117 --> 00:40:29,117
No one knows who it was?

253
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:33,997
You're all idiots.

254
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:38,317
Find him and bring him to me.

255
00:40:41,557 --> 00:40:44,597
What do they say?
--Not a damn thing.

256
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:52,757
It may only have been
Gennaro Savastano.

257
00:40:55,677 --> 00:41:01,037
<i> send a wreath to the family

--Massimo.

259
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:06,157
Yes, find him.

260
00:41:06,237 --> 00:41:09,237
We must go back to Naples.

261
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:07,797
<i> is Manu.
I can not answer now. Call later. </ I>

262
00:42:25,357 --> 00:42:30,757
It looked like a revenge murder
by Tonino Russo was murdered.

263
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:36,117
<i> But police have found
a charred corpse in the car </ i>

The victim's identity is not yet known.
and can only be identified--

266
00:42:46,037 --> 00:42:51,797
--because it was considered
a diamond ring inside the car.

strength to protect my family.

Hear my prayer, O Lord. Amen.
