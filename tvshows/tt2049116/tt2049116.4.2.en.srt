2
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:25,004
Put your cigarettes out.

3
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:32,802
Who's here, Pietro?

4
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:34,762
Open it.

5
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:38,081
ONE YEAR LATER

6
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,841
Hello, little Pietro.

7
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:43,961
- Azzurra, nice to meet you.
- Valeria. Please, come in.

8
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:46,281
Sweetheart, let's show them the pool.

9
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:48,163
- This way.
- Thank you.

10
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:50,803
Look, there's Daddy!

11
00:00:51,963 --> 00:00:54,241
Gennaro, this is the party planner.

12
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:57,881
- Gennaro Savastano.
- Valeria, "Dream Birthday".

13
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,841
What attractions do you offer?

14
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:04,680
There are inflatables, cotton candy,
mimes, clowns... Whatever you want.

15
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:08,280
We'll take it all.
It has to be an amazing party.

16
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:10,640
- How many kids are there in his class?
- Twenty-five.

17
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:13,002
We have the invitations ready.

18
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:19,080
- We'll need a hundred, though.
- Why do we need 100 invitations?

19
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:22,920
We have to tell the whole school,
the neighborhood.

20
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:25,399
- It has to be huge.
- Right.

21
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,879
Sweetie, do you like these invitations?

22
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:31,639
Just one favor...
Don't dress the girls like that.

23
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:34,999
- They'll scare the kids.
- Don't worry.

24
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:39,239
Maybe something more colorful,
if you don't mind.

25
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:41,319
- I'll see them out.
- Yes.

26
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:43,721
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

27
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:48,120
- We'll dress them as clowns.
- Good call.

28
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:20,117
Gennaro, I'd like you to meet
Alberto Resta.

29
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,717
His grandfather built half Naples.

30
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,517
- And he and his father the rest.
- Michele likes to exaggerate.

31
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,559
I know your résumé.

32
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,077
But you don't get to know people
through their track records, do you?

33
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:39,996
You're right.
My family taught me to speak in facts.

34
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:43,276
Michele told me you have set up
a consortium to transform

35
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:47,156
this abandoned place
into the largest airport in Campania.

36
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:49,278
A huge undertaking.

37
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:55,076
Yes, and the only thing I'm missing
is someone like you.

38
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:57,156
A leading businessman

39
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,955
who rescued the family business
and lot of workers.

40
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:03,197
This does you credit.

41
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:08,677
But now you're deep in debt
and the banks are after you.

42
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:15,357
If you decide to head the consortium,
I'll give you 15%.

43
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:21,075
Thank you, it's a fine offer,
but I can't accept.

44
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:23,874
The banks are after me.

45
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:27,154
At the moment
I don't have funds to buy shares.

46
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,634
I'll give them to you anyway.

47
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:33,034
You can give me the money
when our planes are in the air.

48
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,194
On one condition, though:

49
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:40,474
hiring, acquisitions and contracts
must all be according to law.

50
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:44,274
Above reproach.

51
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:48,233
That's not a problem,
I'm used to playing clean.

52
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:50,673
Good man.

53
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:53,755
So, Alberto, I guess
I can call you by name now.

54
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,910
You fucking scum, get outta here!

55
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:11,190
You fucking assholes,
go back where you came from!

56
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:14,270
Go away, you bastards!

57
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,990
Piece of shit!

58
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:18,030
Go back to the sewers!

59
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:19,392
Get outta here!

60
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:31,071
- Sweetheart...
- Daddy, the smell's come back.

61
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:35,591
Know what we'll do?

62
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:38,671
We'll shut it out.

63
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,149
Maria.

64
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,427
Why aren't you in bed?

65
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:39,146
I'm fine, Giovanni,
why would I be in bed?

66
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,706
Hello, my darling.

67
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,626
They're so pretty, did you pick them?

68
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:46,828
What's in your backpack?

69
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:51,628
Are there any toys?

70
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,468
Let me see.

71
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:06,107
When do you get the results?

72
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:21,345
- Have they told you anything?
- I already got them.

73
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:22,907
And?

74
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:26,546
I got them today.

75
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:31,584
- I'm coming home.
- How's that possible?

76
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,544
Are you really coming home?

77
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:36,146
I really am! Are you happy, my love?

78
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:01,385
- Alberto.
- Hi, Gennaro.

79
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:06,265
- Well?
- It makes a good impression.

80
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:10,625
I'll show you the rest, come.

81
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:19,782
Here, it's all still work in progress.

82
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:21,902
But...

83
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:24,422
This is your office.

84
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:28,022
It's wonderful! I can't wait to start.

85
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,984
I'll show you the rest.

86
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:34,862
- Did you see the list of those guys?
- They all have an excellent CV.

87
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:37,863
It's the only way to win,
with top people.

88
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:42,143
This is the project.

89
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:50,101
We have to buy the land
before we apply to manage the airport.

90
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:53,301
How long have we got
to present the investment plans?

91
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:55,581
- Until the end of the month.
- We better hurry.

92
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,861
- I wanted to ask you something.
- What is it?

93
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:02,260
There's someone
who has always been by my side,

94
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:05,300
a very accomplished
and honest young woman.

95
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:08,540
I'd like to have her by my side
on this project, too.

96
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:11,422
Not a problem. Introduce her to me.

97
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:19,340
Hi, Tiziana.
Tiziana Palumbo, Gennaro Savastano.

98
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:22,260
- Pleased to meet you.
- My pleasure.

99
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,661
Please.

100
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:30,259
Well...

101
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:33,499
Tiziana graduated in London,
at the top of her class

102
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:36,981
and straight after that
she began working with me.

103
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:39,899
You know, Alberto,

104
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:44,699
lots of our youth, the brightest,
go to study abroad.

105
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:48,298
Because in this shit country
they have no opportunities.

106
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,100
Whereas you came back to fight,
that takes courage.

107
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,898
You're giving us a huge opportunity.

108
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,060
If I can be at your side,
then that courage has been rewarded.

109
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,299
Good boy, sweetheart. Your hand...

110
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,779
The other hand.

111
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:22,139
Good.

112
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:26,339
What is it, Gennaro?
Are you dreaming?

113
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,577
I was thinking about
what's gonna happen when he's older.

114
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,499
After he's studied in London,
or in America.

115
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:40,016
What people will think
when they hear his last name.

116
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:43,016
And what will they say?

117
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,736
That's Pietro Savastano,
the great musician!

118
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:49,896
Or engineer, architect...

119
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:52,416
Or astronaut? Eh, Pietro?

120
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,738
Do you want to be an astronaut, darling?

121
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:00,857
That's what they'll say.

122
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:05,457
Are you ready? Shall we go to school?

123
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,576
Is this the song you like?

124
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,096
This is it, right?

125
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,056
How does it go?

126
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,933
See you later?

127
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:01,535
- You're not coming in today either?
- Next time.

128
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,973
- Say goodbye to Daddy.
- Be good.

129
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:10,133
- We'll see you later.
- Bye.

130
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:12,694
Let's go, give me your hand.

131
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:37,051
Hi, Annachiara.

132
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,733
- Good morning.
- How are you?

133
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:45,053
- If you need anything, we're here.
- Thank you, Maria will be happy.

134
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:49,653
Well, Clara... Annachiara, all good?

135
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:54,053
You did your homework? Let's go.

136
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:03,570
- Gennaro.
- Well?

137
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:07,652
We got half the land
in just a few days, look.

138
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:12,650
- And the rest?
- Negotiations are underway.

139
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:16,490
To speed things up, if you agree,

140
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:19,090
I'd raise our bid by 20%.

141
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:20,770
Perfect.

142
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:23,811
- Will you take care of it?
- Of course, right away.

143
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:28,051
Come, I've had all the plans printed.

144
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,369
Multi-storey carparks, shopping mall.

145
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:37,649
- We got the green light.
- This is the hotel.

146
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,091
We'll raise our bid by 20%.

147
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:45,329
And this is the highway turn-off.

148
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:47,051
It goes to the airport?

149
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,088
Good job, Alberto.
Do we have anyone in City Hall?

150
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,368
Yes, the council wants
to build a new stadium.

151
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,688
Good, let's give them
200,000 euros right away.

152
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,208
Right, so people will know
we're with them straight off.

153
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,128
Good. And we'll let them know
we'll forego the triplication

154
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,728
of the value of the land
that the law guarantees us.

155
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,609
So with that money
the City can fix up schools and housing.

156
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:19,609
In all my career I've never heard
anyone talk like that.

157
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:25,209
Because we are the change.

158
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:17,487
Hello?

159
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,687
Hi, Alberto.

160
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,246
I'll be there soon.

161
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:47,725
- Hi, Alberto.
- Hi, Gennaro. Come.

162
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:53,123
See that land?

163
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,803
The hay bales, that fucking white house?

164
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:59,323
The owner doesn't want to sell.

165
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,403
- How much did we offer?
- 300,000.

166
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:05,043
It's six times its value.
The asshole said no.

167
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:08,245
He's not selling on principle,
it's not a matter of money.

168
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,362
It's always a matter of money.

169
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:15,762
Or else there's something going on.
And you gotta find out what it is.

170
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:19,082
You don't get it,
it's not something I can solve.

171
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,682
You need to frighten him,
use strong-arm tactics.

172
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:25,724
He needs to realize if he doesn't sell,
it's the worst deal of his life.

173
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:42,521
I don't think I heard correctly.

174
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:45,043
By any chance
did you give me an order?

175
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:48,843
No, Gennaro...

176
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,363
But we need this land.

177
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:50,396
You need a hand? Are you lost?

178
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:54,198
I was looking for you.
Gennaro Savastano.

179
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,638
I have an offer for you.

180
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:05,675
If you're one of the people who wants
to buy my land, I'm not selling.

181
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,917
I've already told your friends.

182
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:27,436
I have a wife and kid too.

183
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:43,036
In a clinic in Brazil they can cure
the cancer your wife has.

184
00:19:45,596 --> 00:19:49,873
For less than 300,000 euros they can do
a liver transplant and it's all fixed.

185
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,553
If you sign the papers,
it's all ready to go.

186
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:55,435
I can have you on a flight
tomorrow morning.

187
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,673
There's no hope for my wife.

188
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:02,553
The doctor was clear about that.

189
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:04,913
And what else could they say?

190
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:08,953
Do you know how much a liver transplant
costs in a public hospital?

191
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:12,834
They don't operate on people
who don't have many chances.

192
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:18,192
Is it better to have fewer chances
or none at all?

193
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:20,074
Think about it.

194
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,434
You'll find me here.

195
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,194
But not forever.

196
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,673
Goodbye.

197
00:21:05,912 --> 00:21:09,832
Mom. Thank you, Mom.

198
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:16,310
- Hello, my darling.
- Hi.

199
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:18,990
- Say hello to Mommy nicely.
- Come here.

200
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:23,349
Maria, take it easy.
Maria, what are you doing?

201
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:26,391
As long as I'm here
I'll hold my daughter in my arms.

202
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,230
Yeah, let's go to a pizzeria.

203
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:29,749
- Here are your scuffs.
- Thanks.

204
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:47,146
You have to find
another wife, Giovanni.

205
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:50,826
A good woman,
the girl needs a mother.

206
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,708
What are you talking about?

207
00:22:54,388 --> 00:22:56,428
I don't care about dying.

208
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:01,267
I want to rest, I can't fight anymore.

209
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:08,867
But I can't imagine
not seeing her anymore.

210
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:17,787
Someone came and told me something.

211
00:23:19,027 --> 00:23:20,747
What?

212
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:27,146
They want the land.

213
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:37,144
But in exchange, this person said

214
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:40,464
he can get you
into a hospital in Brazil.

215
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:42,106
That's what he said.

216
00:23:45,186 --> 00:23:47,025
- In Brazil?
- Yes.

217
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:53,225
He said they can give you a transplant.

218
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:57,503
He'll get you on the list.

219
00:23:57,505 --> 00:24:01,665
He said there are livers available,
that's what he said.

220
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:06,545
And who is this person?

221
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:11,024
He's not a nice person.

222
00:24:13,544 --> 00:24:16,344
We even have
somewhere to stay in Brazil.

223
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:21,980
- Hello?
- Gennaro, any news?

224
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:23,539
Not yet.

225
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:27,659
- Time's running out.
- <i>I'm taking care of it.</i>

226
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,741
He won't sell.
Our planes will never fly.

227
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:37,541
- Here's Dad.
- Daddy's boy!

228
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,738
- Giovanni.
- What is it, honey?

229
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,540
I want to go.
I don't give a shit who this person is.

230
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,498
To smell the scent of my daughter's hair
for even one day more

231
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,098
I'll walk to Brazil.

232
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,220
I promise, I can make it.

233
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:29,136
What do you want?

234
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:34,136
What do you want?

235
00:28:21,694 --> 00:28:23,854
I'm still waiting for the call.

236
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:31,414
Why didn't you call me?

237
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:57,653
Because you disgust me.
Now get off my land.

238
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:40,251
Gennaro.

239
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:46,290
Everything okay?

240
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,370
What the fuck did you do, Alberto?

241
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,568
Try to understand,
time was running out.

242
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:04,048
Something had to be done,
we couldn't just stand around waiting.

243
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,490
Being enterprising means
making moves.

244
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,649
But you made a bad move.

245
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:55,726
- Hi, Uncle.
- Gennaro, well? How are things?

246
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,328
All good.

247
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:02,605
- You look well.
- So do you.

248
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,005
So, tell me, why did you call me?

249
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:07,167
I want to show you something.

250
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,607
You know this area is full of poison.

251
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:18,125
I need to know which land is clean
and which is contaminated

252
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,127
and who made money off it.

253
00:31:23,086 --> 00:31:25,284
Around here, people are strange.

254
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:27,084
Now everyone's protesting,

255
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,964
but in the past many of them
didn't think it was a problem

256
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:34,084
if you couldn't drink tap water anymore.

257
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:36,726
As long as you had money
to buy mineral water.

258
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:42,324
Give me a little time
and I'll let you know as soon as I can.

259
00:31:42,326 --> 00:31:43,846
Thank you.

260
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:00,885
Hi, baby.

261
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,405
Gennaro, everything okay?

262
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:07,165
So-so.

263
00:32:19,364 --> 00:32:22,642
Why are these invitations still here
if the party is the day after tomorrow?

264
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:24,882
Daddy doesn't know yet.

265
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:28,002
We decided that on Saturday
it will just be the three of us.

266
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:29,682
Right, darling?

267
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:35,801
We'll go out to lunch,
then we'll go to the amusement park...

268
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:38,003
Then we'll go to the movies.

269
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:46,721
What happened?

270
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:49,883
I gave out the invitations last week.

271
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:56,321
I put them on the coat racks.

272
00:32:56,323 --> 00:32:57,883
Nobody took them.

273
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:03,040
They stayed there for two days.

274
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:07,922
In the end I took them away,
so at least Pietro wouldn't notice.

275
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,962
Listen to me, Gennaro...

276
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:19,720
Pietro is happier this way.

277
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:24,839
We'll go to the movies,
we'll get ice cream.

278
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:27,441
It will just be the three of us.

279
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:31,641
Don't worry.

280
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,920
Let's go see, Cheetah.

281
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,600
- Is this the guy?
- Now we'll see.

282
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,358
You didn't understand?

283
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,118
You're not welcome here.

284
00:34:49,718 --> 00:34:52,876
You know, Giovanni,
I couldn't understand.

285
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:54,358
I swear to you.

286
00:34:56,158 --> 00:35:00,517
I have a wife and a child, I wouldn't
have thought twice about it.

287
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:05,357
"So, what the fuck
has he got to think about?"

288
00:35:09,837 --> 00:35:13,795
I was curious
so I asked a few questions.

289
00:35:13,797 --> 00:35:15,797
And you know what I found out?

290
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:20,915
The most dangerous shit
isn't what you can see,

291
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:23,396
it's what you can't see.

292
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:32,036
Where did you bury the poison?
There? Behind there?

293
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:38,316
I did what everybody else did.

294
00:35:40,396 --> 00:35:45,116
I needed money.
It was just a few drums.

295
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:51,075
I know.

296
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:54,995
That's why you didn't want to sell.

297
00:35:56,435 --> 00:35:59,035
You didn't want anyone
to find out the truth.

298
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:05,435
Does your wife know
she's dying because of you?

299
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:13,674
Does your daughter know
what a shitty father you are?

300
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,914
You know what we'll do now?

301
00:36:20,794 --> 00:36:24,234
You'll take this money. Take it.

302
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:29,152
You go somewhere nice,
far from here.

303
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:31,714
Far from all this shit.

304
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:46,633
- But wasn't it 300,000 euros?
- Before.

305
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:51,993
The time for good deeds is over,
now you do what I say.

306
00:36:56,073 --> 00:37:00,112
With the rest of the money I have
to remove the shit you put under here.

307
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:04,952
I'll see you at the notary's office.

308
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,348
Sorry, can I help you?

309
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,948
School's not over yet.

310
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,550
Did you hear me?

311
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:30,909
Mr Savastano, good morning.

312
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:35,146
- No, you can't stay here.
- Today is Pietro's birthday.

313
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:39,308
I know. You can't come into my classroom
like this, there are rules.

314
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,706
My son has to celebrate
like all the other kids.

315
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,308
The other kids don't celebrate in class.

316
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,828
Look how many presents!
Shall we unwrap them?

317
00:39:33,306 --> 00:39:35,786
They'll give you all the information.

318
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:39,186
I'll see you, have a good day.

00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:53,263
There are problems
in Simone's class.

320
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,463
Can you check it out?

00:39:55,465 --> 00:39:56,865
Two minutes.

322
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:40,223
Mr Resta, there's a package for you.

00:40:41,503 --> 00:40:43,381
At this hour?

324
00:40:43,383 --> 00:40:47,183
- Did they say who they were?
- No, I found it outside the door.

325
00:40:48,503 --> 00:40:50,223
Give it here.

326
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:54,343
- Where are you going, Dad?
- I'll be right back.

327
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:28,819
Dad, we're done, can we go?

328
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:31,899
No! Simona, keep them in there!

329
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,099
Keep them in there!

330
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:37,581

- Stay there!
