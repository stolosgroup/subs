<i>Severe until you reach the sky
mix incense and candles</i>

3
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,871
<i>honest, lighter</i>

00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,511
<i>Hug my necklace and showed me
But you can not delete anything</i>

5
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,631
Please speak it to him, Brother

00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:03,791
<i>Worshipped if the police kill me
I love to be hated...</i>

7
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:08,191
What is it?

8
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:14,271
Did not you hear the text? Do you think
I need to hear it?

9
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:17,831
Are you worried about it with Conte?

10
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,511
Do you think that Salvatore Conte
looking forward to meeting me?

11
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:26,071
He was waiting for me with open arms.

12
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:32,911
He probably forgot that I
set fire to his mother's apartment.

13
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:35,871
Yes, I'm concerned.

14
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,951
Also, because I leave you alone here.

15
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:45,271
Do not worry about it.
Get an agreement with Conte.

16
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:50,631
When you return,
it will be us who is in charge here.

17
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:57,191
- Can I turn on the music again?
- Hurry, otherwise the plane.

18
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:50,111
Here you go. This way.

19
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:57,511
Wait.

20
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:00,551
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

21
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:37,431
- Can I meet Don Salvatore now?
- I drive you to the hotel.

22
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:41,391
- To the hotel?
- Those are my orders.

23
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:56,111
<i>On Sunday are elections in Catalonia.</i>

24
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,791
<i>The favorite, Javier Lozano Iglesias,
supports the independence project.</i>

25
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:04,271
<i>Eulalia Cases y Santos is a sure winner.</i>

26
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:08,231
<i>5.4 million Catalans
must choose 135 MPs.</i>

27
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:11,711
<i>Selection premises are open
CET. 8:00 to 20:00.</i>

28
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:35,151
Here is nice.
- It is at your disposal.

29
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:41,391
- What do we do now?
- You rest. I'll call you later.

30
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:15,751
<i>Hola. My room is not good.</i>

31
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:19,671
No, it's not good. Switch.

32
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:23,031
Another room, yes.

33
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:26,871
<i>Gracias.</i>

34
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,471
Fuck you.

35
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:53,151
Has he arrived? Yes.

36
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:57,551
I give Don Salvatore message.

37
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,111
Fine. Give him another room.

38
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:46,991
<i>- Who is it?
- It's me.</i>

39
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:52,791
We put it away.

40
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,711
Yes!

41
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:03,711
Your mobile phone is switched off.
I need to talk to you.

42
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:10,151
Hurry, time is pressing. Hurry!

43
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:12,591
Wait a second.

44
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:16,191
Our contact has sent a message.

45
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:21,991
The money has arrived, and I
has determined that you have to do it.

46
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:26,991
If Ciro solve it with Conte,
everything falls into place.

47
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:31,391
- But where is Honduras?
- Close to Mexico and Guatemala.

48
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:34,071
- Why me?
- It's the start.

49
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:37,591
We must turn our name stuck.

50
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:41,511
This is bigger than all the rest.

51
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:47,591
If it works out, all come
to us, and no one could touch us.

52
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:53,511
It is also for you. Everyone will
understand who called the shots.

53
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:58,671
Everyone will finally understand
you're the boss.

54
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:03,311
Well, mom. I'll do it.

55
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,591
I is a Savastano. I'll do it.

56
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:11,831
Then we will be the biggest.

57
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:15,151
Where are you going? Come here.

58
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:18,191
No one knows anything about it.

59
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,911
What about Noemi?
- Say you'll be traveling.

60
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:24,831
But do not know where you're going.

61
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:30,311
It only works if no
know nothing about it. Got it?

62
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:33,791
- Fine.
- Not even Ciro.

63
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:40,471
Not even Ciro.

64
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:34,071
- Hello?
- We do not do anything today.

65
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:38,831
What the hell do you mean?
What the hell am I supposed to do?

66
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,911
What do I know?
Do as you will. See you tomorrow.

67
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:02,551
Wait. Come here. Wait, honey!

68
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,871
What am I waiting for?

69
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:09,511
That I'll be back.
So it will be us who decide.

70
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:12,991
You promise a lot,
but you never keep your promises.

71
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:17,751
I was supposed to be a queen.
Looks like it might castle?

72
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:21,391
And now I also
waiting for you. Why?

73
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,631
- Because when I come back...
- "When I come back ..."

74
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:39,151
Are you coming back? Is it safe?

75
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,751
Yes.

76
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:46,271
Give me proof.
- Proof?

77
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:49,631
A proof of your love.

78
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:10,871
It does not matter.
I was still tired of it.

79
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:14,711
You're a loser, Genna!
You let others control over you.

80
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,551
You're a loser.
You're just a poor fool!

81
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:34,631
Shit! The son of a bitch.

82
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:42,751
The son of a bitch.

83
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:45,311
Fucking pigs...

84
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,831
<i>- Who is it?
- Breakfast, sir.</i>

85
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:44,551
Good day.
The phone is broken. Kaput.

86
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:48,471
- Someone is waiting for you.
What do you say?

87
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:52,751
Someone is waiting for you in the lobby.

88
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:55,231
Yes, sir.

89
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:01,711
Good morning. The car stops outside.

90
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,351
I want to thank him for last night.

91
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:12,831
Can you see that?

92
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,831
Part of it is his.

93
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,631
He is also behind this. 25 floors.

94
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:39,951
This is the most important thing: a casino.

95
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:44,911
- Pull over.
Why?

96
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:47,671
- I have to pee.
Here?

97
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:51,391
If you do not stop, I pee in the car.

98
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:03,591
Sightseeing tour is over now.
Take me to Conte!

99
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:08,831
- I have orders to...
- I will not give a shit. Call him.

100
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:12,671
Pick up the phone,
otherwise I'll kill you. Hurry!

101
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:15,351
Call him! Call him!

102
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:20,471
That's me.
We have a problem with the guest.

103
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:25,271
We are on the way.

104
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,311
It was good.

105
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:06,271
Are you faithful?

106
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:13,471
It's important.
A believer is never alone.

107
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,871
One is not afraid of anything.

108
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:33,031
Without my faith
I would never have achieved anything.

109
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:46,831
And I have only
one person to thank for that.

110
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:51,591
The person taught me
what it means to be a believer.

111
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:56,311
The person is my mother.

112
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:14,591
Have you met my mother?

113
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:20,911
It you are.
You even know where she lives.

114
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:33,111
Like it?

115
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:40,791
I really like it.
You either hear or see anything.

116
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:48,031
Excuse me, Don Salvatore,
but when can we talk?

117
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:50,831
What is it? Is it urgent?

118
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,991
I would have taken care of everything,
so I can go home.

119
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:06,351
You little shit!
You even came armed.

120
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:11,271
You came armed.
I know it was you.

121
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:15,871
I know it was you.
Who set fire to the mother's apartment?

122
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:20,311
- That's an order!
- An order from another asshole!

123
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:24,191
And now you must die.

124
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:31,151
Where the hell are you going?
Fucking bastard!

125
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:06,711
We buy it all, Genna.
100, 200, 300 kilos.

126
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,111
We take everything they have.

127
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:12,311
But you have to put the price.
You must be crafty.

128
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:16,191
Start with 1.20
and not more than 1.40.

129
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:21,071
- I get it. A maximum of 1.40.
- Good.

130
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:26,871
We sell it to the dealers for 30
and they sell it on for 50

131
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:31,591
Then we have control over.
There will be no one else left.

132
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:37,471
Do not do more. Let me know
When you're done, so I'm taking over.

133
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:41,511
What happens then?
- Nothing. You need to be there.

134
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:45,591
For when the load is sent away,
money is sent from here-

135
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:50,151
And when they arrive,
you can travel back to Naples.

136
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:55,631
Why should I wait?
- You are a guarantee. You are Savastano.

137
00:21:55,711 --> 00:22:02,311
If you are there when the money forward.
When they do, you can go home.

138
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:06,231
- Fine.
- This is the contact.

139
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:12,351
But learn the number by heart.
Leaflet must be destroyed.

140
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,191
Good travel.
May Our Lady be with you.

141
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:19,951
- Goodbye, Baroncino.
- Goodbye, Gennaro.

142
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:24,871
- Donna Imma...
- Goodbye, Baroncino.

143
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,191
What is it?

144
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,911
You look like your father.

145
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:48,231
- I need to learn the number by heart.
- Good.

146
00:23:55,871 --> 00:24:02,031
<i>Call can not be answered right now.
Please call back later.</i>

147
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:13,271
Come here. Up you go.

148
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:23,471
That's it.

149
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:30,791
There is someone who will talk to you.

150
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:38,631
<i>- Hello?
We can talk tonight.</i>

151
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:43,311
<i>They pick you up at. 22.00.
Are you in? Hello?</i>

152
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:46,351
Roger that.

153
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:24,551
- Now we are almost even.
- Almost?

154
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:30,511
Yes. In order to get rid
I ought to get your mother to cry.

155
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:33,431
I do not have a mother.

156
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:41,831
Sit down.

157
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:53,231
I prefer
my own home in the evening-

158
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:59,511
- But I have invested in this
and wanted to see the place. Like it?

159
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,471
Yes. Even though this is pretty empty.

160
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:09,431
It is early. We are in Spain.
People still have not eaten dinner.

161
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:15,551
Don Salvatore, we'll have it all sorted.

162
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:17,751
Of course.

163
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:23,191
Now that marokkaneren is mine,
will fix it all.

164
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:33,791
Pietro Savastano has treated me
as a loser, but I buy them all.

165
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,991
There are changes coming.
New winds are blowing.

166
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:42,111
Maybe you're new to win?

167
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:47,311
Yes, but above all, son.

168
00:26:47,391 --> 00:26:50,471
The fat one? Nonsense!

169
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:53,631
He only has a head
to keep the ears separated.

170
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:59,031
But he's a good boy,
and he listens to advice.

171
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,591
Mother?

172
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:15,311
I've tried to call Ciro
all day, but he does not answer.

173
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:19,071
- The mobile phone is switched off.
What do you want Ciro?

174
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:26,871
I just wanted to say hi.

175
00:27:31,991 --> 00:27:35,551
- Are you scared?
- No.

176
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:39,911
Not for my own sake.

177
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,551
For you.

178
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:48,511
I leave here.
We do not know where Ciro's.

179
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:53,111
If only Ciro?
There are a lot of others here.

180
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:56,471
So, Gennaro.
Go to bed. It's late.

181
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,471
You're leaving in four hours.

182
00:28:01,551 --> 00:28:04,431
- Mother?
- Yes.

183
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:10,071
The girl, Noemi...

184
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:13,591
I broke up with her.

185
00:28:13,671 --> 00:28:16,471
You were right.
She was not for me.

186
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:19,871
Good. You did right in.

187
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:25,031
- Mother?
- Yes? What is it?

188
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:34,471
- Are you going to miss me a little?
- Oh, Gennaro...

189
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:37,831
Of course I'll do it.

190
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:45,871
- You give me a kiss?
You're getting too big for that.

191
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:57,751
I miss you already.
Do you understand that?

192
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:05,391
If something happens to you,
I will come right away. Got it?

193
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:13,911
Some petrol stations, and others oil.

194
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:17,991
I have the oil, but we have gasoline tanks.

195
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:22,831
We must be a little better friends.

196
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:26,751
Do I look to suffer Without your fuel tanks?

197
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:31,471
- I Missing something?
- They do not lack anything.

198
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:38,551
But at our house
we are the best. You know this.

199
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,391
They just consider it.

200
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:50,111
Would you consider it?

201
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:55,071
Yes, I will. I assume
and urinating and considering it.

202
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:40,991
Jeremenko is very angry with you.
You play for high stakes.

203
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:44,911
Hey... Hey!

204
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:47,631
Can not you see I'm busy?

205
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:52,711
There is a piece of shit that followed
Don Salvatore into the toilet.

206
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:58,791
- Do not come here again.
- Don Salvatore! Is there something wrong?

207
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:03,911
The ride is threatening me on my area.
Where the hell have you been?

208
00:31:13,111 --> 00:31:18,791
Watch. There are also here rats. Russians.

209
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:22,351
Tell me who it was,
we should be careful with?

210
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:28,711
Jeremenko.
He is very big and you...

211
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:32,471
Is small.

212
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:39,071
Do you know what the difference between us?
You can tell your boss that.

213
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,791
Do not move!

214
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,871
Go away.

215
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,711
Go and tell your boss.

216
00:32:18,951 --> 00:32:23,791
The fucking Russians
is extremely rich and vicious.

217
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:32,151
If they think
that is enough to become leaders...

218
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:37,591
Then they are mistaken.
You need it here.

219
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:40,631
They still have a lot to learn.

220
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:52,871
Excuse me, Don Salvatore.
What about my suggestion?

221
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:56,951
They still have not said
what you think of it.

222
00:32:57,031 --> 00:33:00,391
I still have not understood
who your boss is.

223
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:03,991
I can say, I have some influence.

224
00:33:05,431 --> 00:33:10,431
And if we make a deal
you will have only one problem.

225
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:14,871
To count our money.

226
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:33,151
Don Salvatore! Don Salvatore.

227
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,351
- We must get away from here.
- It hurts!

228
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:36,751
Behave nicely.

229
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:49,191
Yes, Rome is perfect.

230
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:53,791
<i>However, it must be
with the first flight. Gracias.</i>

231
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:57,791
You can kiss my ass, everybody.

232
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,911
<i>Hola</i>

233
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:04,431
We take such good care of you,
and then you will already home.

234
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:12,671
Wait a minute.
It is never wise to be impulsive.

235
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:17,391
Come down here.

236
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:29,871
There is a stretch of coastline north.

237
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:35,671
They would buy it and make money
on it with their own private harbor.

238
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:38,271
But why leave it to them?

239
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:41,871
I bought it, Then the Russians fuck.

240
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:46,191
It was a mistake.
Now we are enemies-

241
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:51,711
And I have a pinched vertebra
and a dog collar around his neck.

242
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:59,031
We can not kill them.
We have to negotiate with them.

243
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:08,391
I've thought about it.
Do you want to make peace with me?

244
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:12,871
Do you want my Moroccan?

245
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:19,151
Then you need to negotiate with the Russians.

246
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:25,031
And when it's all right,
I can do business with you.

247
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:30,351
It's your case.
Let's not waste time, Ciro.

248
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:34,031
You can not say no.

249
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,871
If you want to return home,
you must seek Jeremenko-

250
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:43,271
And say that we can share it.
60% to me and 40% of them.

251
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,551
As for me?

252
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:50,031
It's the pity.
Russians are really angry now

253
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:54,671
And I can not risk
to lose one of my men. Are you in?

254
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:10,031
Yes, I am with.

255
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,631
- 60% To you and 40% to the Russians.
- Good.

256
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:21,311
I would have had greater chances out to sea.

257
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:27,431
Now you underestimate yourself.

258
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:33,551
Relax. He comes
and pick you up later.

259
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,711
Take care, Ciro.

260
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,791
REGIONAL ELECTIONS

261
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,471
- Do you have paper and pen?
- Yes.

262
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,911
Give it to me. Hurry.

263
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:37,751
Hurry! Give it to me.

264
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:56,151
Good evening.

265
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:01,351
This way.

266
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:14,271
<i>S'il vous plait.</i>

267
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:29,911
Vitalij Jeremenko.

268
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:40,391
Speak up.

269
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:52,711
Signor Conte
would like to solve the problem.

270
00:41:56,871 --> 00:42:00,191
Leaving he tell us?

271
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:05,151
No.

272
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,831
So he will not solve the problem.

273
00:42:12,911 --> 00:42:16,231
He wants to do business with you.

274
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:28,311
Jeremenko never share his stuff with anyone.

275
00:42:28,391 --> 00:42:31,991
What will he do with his stuff?

276
00:42:32,071 --> 00:42:36,591
The system has a major impact here.
It is easier to work with us.

277
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:43,951
There is enough for everyone. Is better
to be friends than to be enemies.

278
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:01,431
- What is it?
- The winners of the next municipal elections.

279
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:05,351
They determine
what needs to be built and by whom.

280
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:13,871
And the technicians from the housing
commission and those who make concessions.

281
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:17,031
We know them. We pay them.

282
00:43:24,751 --> 00:43:29,391
With them are all projects approved.

283
00:43:29,471 --> 00:43:33,911
Without them you can buy
all the reasons you want.

284
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:37,231
It will not take
a building permit after 10 years.

285
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:46,631
Fifty fifty.

286
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:50,751
Our friendships here will also be yours.

287
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:04,271
Do you like to play games with people?

288
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:11,631
They are only candidates.

289
00:44:11,711 --> 00:44:14,711
No one knows who wins.

290
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:24,511
But it is true that I have
more friends here than we have.

291
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:26,711
It is important to have friends.

292
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:30,151
- Friends.
- Friends.

293
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:41,111
We share it.
Fifty fifty.

294
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:01,871
Jeremenko also likes to play tricks.

295
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:10,111
Russian roulette.
Do you know what it is?

296
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:15,431
But this is Jeremenkos variant of it.

297
00:45:25,871 --> 00:45:28,071
I is part of the system.

298
00:45:28,151 --> 00:45:33,311
If I disappear,
it means that we were not in agreement.

299
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:57,071
Those who sent you, know
that you may not return.

300
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:01,351
You are not
particularly important for those Ciro.

301
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:08,871
Half the chances are better than no chance.

302
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:11,831
Fifty-fifty.
- Do it.

303
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:34,151
Look into the light.
When it is turned on, you shoot.

304
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:06,831
Friends.

305
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:02,871
- I said 60% to me, 40% of them.
- Salvatore.

306
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:11,231
However, 50 and 50 is better than nothing.

307
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:16,551
Now you must keep your word.

308
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:22,591
We forget about the past,
and marokkaneren is ours.

309
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:27,031
I have a better suggestion.

310
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:33,191
If you go over to me, your life will change.

311
00:48:33,271 --> 00:48:36,991
I'm honored.

312
00:48:37,071 --> 00:48:41,791
But I already have my own.
And I decide.

313
00:48:41,871 --> 00:48:44,071
Do you really?

314
00:48:45,151 --> 00:48:50,311
Why did they send you saw it,
where you risked to die?

315
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,831
It is, as it is.

316
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:57,791
I'm fine where I am.

317
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:06,071
I hope that it will always be that way.

318
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:32,271
- Hello, lawyer.
- Hello, donna Imma.

319
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:35,591
Why the urgency?
Has there been Pietro something?

320
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:39,431
Your husband is furious.

321
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:44,351
Ciro in Spain and Gennaro
South America was not his orders.

322
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:47,471
Wait a minute.

323
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:51,271
- I forgot something.
- I'll wait here.

324
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:01,831
What do you mean? Is Gennaro here?

325
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:05,431
- He's gone.
- Where is he?

326
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:09,711
I do not know. Only donna Imma
and Baroncino know where he is.

327
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:14,071
- Hurry.
What are we?

328
00:50:14,151 --> 00:50:17,351
We're going home to Savastano.

329
00:51:09,991 --> 00:51:14,431
- Are you okay?
- Cut the crap, Imma.

330
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:19,951
You must explain to me
what the hell is going on.

331
00:52:18,671 --> 00:52:21,391
What is it you want to say?

332
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:26,991
I have always stood by your side.

333
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:30,511
Now you're not here.

334
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,031
But I'm still here.

335
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,831
