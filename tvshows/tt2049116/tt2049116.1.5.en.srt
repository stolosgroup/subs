00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:27,363
<i>Milan station.</i>

3
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:33,323
<i>Intercity 4374 from Naples</i>

4
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:39,723
<i>arrive at 8:45 to track four
instead of eight tracks.</i>

5
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,683
Pasquale?

6
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:57,563
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

7
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:36,243
It is to the company.

8
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:40,763
- What is it?
- Just type in. Relax.

9
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:47,043
Write your initials on each page
and a signature at the end.

10
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:58,283
Smile. I just transferred
EUR 20 million for you.

11
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:03,283
- I'm taking Salba and save you.
- Salba is worth 200 according to the contract.

12
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:09,163
I get 10% and you go home by 90% to pennies.

13
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:15,083
Without the pennies,
we would end up in court.

14
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:20,843
But the main thing is profit.

15
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:27,883
You also determines by 10%.
Do we agree?

16
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:23,923
You look great. You are tanned.

17
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:30,643
I feel better.
Here there is no arguing with.

18
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:35,283
I have time to think.
How are you?

19
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:40,283
Fine. Have you heard
Gennaro's got a girlfriend?

20
00:04:45,123 --> 00:04:47,483
Is she pretty?

21
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:50,043
That's a good girl.

22
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:54,843
Gennaro...

23
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:59,283
The motorcycle that I gave you,
did you do it?

24
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:03,483
Does it run?

25
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:09,443
It works, but after the accident
it is not as before.

26
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:13,403
Change filter.

27
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:16,123
So does it again.

28
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:40,083
Hey.
Hey.

29
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:42,923
- Were you sleeping?
- No.

30
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:50,043
I am glad that you are awake
I have nothing good to say.

31
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:53,123
It is very good.

32
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:59,483
- I bought a company.
- Have you?

33
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:05,283
It is a large company that has just
won a big debate.

34
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:09,123
It's called Salba, and I bought it for us.

35
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:15,443
I was tired of making others rich,
and I would do anything for us.

36
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:21,043
I did it also for the child's sake.

37
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:23,963
It was so unexpected.

38
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:18,363
Genny! Genny! Genny!

39
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:22,683
Come on!

40
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:28,123
It was the third.
Here, the fourth.

41
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:33,843
Genny! Genny!

42
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:37,683
It is enough.
I have things to do. See you.

43
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:43,283
Can you not?
Shut up and suck my dick.

44
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:52,603
Father has brilliant.

45
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:57,803
He may be in solitary and still be on top.

46
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:01,803
Father is his punishment of the toilet.

47
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:04,883
But there are some things that are not major.

48
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:09,763
The sale goes bad. Do you know why?

49
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:14,203
We do not Contes dope anymore
and it is better.

50
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:18,723
After the police took the cargo,
we sell this crap.

51
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:22,763
The junkies will their dope elsewhere.

52
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:28,523
The money comes,
and we can get good dope again.

53
00:08:30,883 --> 00:08:33,443
Do you want to know the truth?

54
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:46,643
There is no finger pointing.

55
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:52,003
When the cat is away,
mice play on the table.

56
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:56,523
Your father must let someone else decide.

57
00:08:57,683 --> 00:09:02,123
You can not lead from solitary confinement.

58
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:07,843
You are about time you take over.

59
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,963
And if you decide...

60
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:14,523
There are new rules of engagement.

61
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:18,043
It's crazy to see it without people.

62
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:21,203
Make moment Perla.

63
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:30,123
There are also smaller rooms,
but I'd rather have it all.

64
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:34,523
We can hire the DJ from Ibiza, as you like.

65
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:38,523
Sven V×”th-?
- Eighteenth birthday is great.

66
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:43,803
"Can I get some rest
to a point in the program?"

67
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:49,483
"Perla must waltz with her father."

68
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:54,483
I can not dance.
- I will take you.

69
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:04,283
Excuse me.

70
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:06,923
Donna Imma.

71
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:10,243
Yes.

72
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:13,243
Of course, when you want.

73
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,083
Fine. It's good.

74
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:24,843
All due respect.

75
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:45,963
- What's up?
- We need cash.

76
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:49,243
This is easily corrected. How much?

77
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:54,763
Everything I Ciro joined,
which turned into bonds somewhere.

78
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:58,043
In Finland. Do you believe them?

79
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:01,243
I said we would need them.

80
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:05,443
Is that a problem?
No, not at all.

81
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:11,523
But the Finnish bonds offer
good return, it would be a shame.

82
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:14,763
I can take them in Panama

83
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:18,963
- Administered Pasquale De Vivo.

84
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:23,043
I do not think it is a good investment.

85
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:29,843
Trust me. It may take some time
but it's probably for the best.

86
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:35,083
You said they were cash.
They were AAA and had to Finland.

87
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:42,843
Wait Gennaro. I think
there has been a misunderstanding.

88
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:46,083
My husband says we need money.

89
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:52,563
I do not think Don Pietro
to keep abreast of market developments.

90
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:55,363
My husband decides.

91
00:11:55,443 --> 00:12:00,243
If my husband gets it, as he wants it.

92
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:08,723
I do not trust him.

93
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:14,803
He thinks he can do as he pleases,
while your father is in prison.

94
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:21,723
You can not manage from isolation.
Father may assign the site.

95
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:25,483
Says who?
- It says Ciro.

96
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:32,883
Ciro should mind their own business.
He's not family.

97
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:36,883
I can not release the bonds.
These are new times.

98
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:39,283
You may be able to do anything.

99
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:42,803
Credit Authorization can mess things up.

100
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:45,283
There are strict rules for all.

101
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:48,883
After all that I have earned on interest.

102
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:53,723
Musi, you are an important customer for us.

103
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:57,683
You must ask new security
if you sell the bonds.

104
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:01,643
I bought Salba, who won a debate.

105
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:06,483
Take it as collateral.
- It does not go with Salba.

106
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,963
Assets are most intangible.

107
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:14,163
Should I transfer
negotiation, if you do not pay?

108
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:28,083
How nice. Is it a conch?

109
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:31,483
- Open the.
- Help me.

110
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:39,763
It is not zirconia. It's diamonds.

111
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:44,603
Really? As yours?
Do we have the same now?

112
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:47,243
Thank you.

113
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:51,203
- Do you like them?
- Of course I can.

114
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:54,123
You are so sweet.

115
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:04,683
Mother.

116
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:10,763
- Mother.
- The money is to come.

117
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:13,643
- What do we do?
- We're leaving.

118
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:16,603
Are we going to Milan?

119
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:21,683
- When?
- Tomorrow.

120
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:28,563
We can call.

121
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:31,483
You know you can not call.

122
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:34,523
Okay, so off we go.

123
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:39,363
Are you with her, then?

124
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:42,723
Her name is Noemi.

125
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:09,083
What is it?

126
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:12,163
A love nest. Like it?

127
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:16,443
- Come on.
- Let me go, Gennaro.

128
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:27,643
When I come back, you should be here.

129
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,243
When are you coming back?

130
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:38,243
- When are you coming back?
- Soon.

131
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:44,403
Soon when?

132
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:48,483
What?
- Very soon.

133
00:15:55,643 --> 00:15:58,843
I does not matter very soon.

134
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:02,163
What do you say?

135
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:06,923
I want a man.
Not one who obeys the mother.

136
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:14,643
A man?

137
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:19,923
As disobey any?

138
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,003
Yes?

139
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:51,603
You are mine now.

140
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:33,083
- Donna Imma.
- Hello.

141
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:37,283
We called the office,
and they said you were sick.

142
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:40,803
Yes, I have it pretty bad.

143
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,323
Go ahead, sit down.

144
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:51,443
- Franco.
- Genny.

145
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:55,043
- How are you?
- Sort of.

146
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:58,203
Shall we go into the living room?

147
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:04,363
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

148
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:09,883
It is normal that it takes a little time.

149
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,963
The large amount.

150
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:17,003
Clear.
But we would understand the situation.

151
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,363
Yes, of course.

152
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:23,443
Hello, Franco. Good day.

153
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:29,803
I go into the next room.

154
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:37,523
It's my daughter.
- Do you have a daughter?

155
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:41,963
She's my wife's daughter
but she is like my own.

156
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:45,843
Where is she beautiful, very beautiful.

157
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:52,963
What were we talking about?
- We come into the office tomorrow.

158
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:57,043
We will familiarize ourselves with it all.

159
00:18:57,123 --> 00:19:00,723
Yes, that's fine. Perfect.

160
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:25,243
Here you go. Here is the office.

161
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:29,843
Good day. Welcome.

162
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:33,923
Here's investment list first real estate.

163
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:37,963
- If it were in also in the paper?
- Yes.

164
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:42,083
- So give me the paper.
Yes, you will.

165
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:46,283
Here, then, a list of the property.

166
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:50,683
I can compare it
with the company's purchase contract.

167
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:52,483
Good.

168
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:58,643
On the basis of supply and market
estimated appreciation to...

169
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:01,963
Can I see?

170
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:07,283
I mean, I can assess
the estimated appreciation.

171
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:12,323
- What does it mean?
It's the return on investment.

172
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:16,843
Fuck.
- I am in the next room.

173
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,443
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you.

174
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,163
No.

175
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:29,603
I'll see you later.

176
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:32,283
Happy reading.

177
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:53,323
Federico? Hey, it's Franco.

178
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:58,963
Good. You?
I have a suggestion. Can we meet?

179
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:05,163
Fine. Then I come over. Hey.

180
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:08,403
Tell me something.

181
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:11,963
You just got to and says it is twice worth.

182
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:16,563
And you sell it for the price
you gave. Do I look like an idiot?

183
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:19,283
You are right.

184
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:24,043
I need cash.
I want to buy something else.

185
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:27,403
- Did you say 20?
Yes, 20

186
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:30,483
- Quick.
- I have to think about it.

187
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:35,723
There's no time. It is, therefore,
I give up profits.

188
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:41,043
You take it now, otherwise I ask Marchisio.

189
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:50,803
I need to check the numbers.
If they vote, we can act.

190
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:18,083
What are we doing here, mom?

191
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:21,243
Can you see the red buildings?

192
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:24,643
They are ours.

193
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:28,123
- Both of them?
- Yes.

194
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:41,443
Gennaro. Look over there.

195
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:46,523
It's ours.
- What?

196
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:51,843
Yes, and you know who, who made it?

197
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:55,283
Your father. He has done it all.

198
00:22:55,363 --> 00:22:59,523
That is why we must take care of it.
Do you understand?

199
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:03,923
- I need to buy a gift.
- Do you understand nothing?

200
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:09,003
I need to buy a gift for Noemi.
The houses go nowhere.

201
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,723
See you later.

202
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:26,163
The capital structure should have
better financial instruments.

203
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:33,363
Real estate generates no income,
but money begets money.

204
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:39,163
I can beget money without spending a cent

205
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:42,363
- Taking and giving loans.
Currency trading.

206
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:49,003
And above all I can do it without risk.

207
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:53,323
Why?
- If a lawyer gets a tip...

208
00:23:53,403 --> 00:23:58,563
He can track real estate but not money.

209
00:23:58,643 --> 00:24:05,283
I can move money
around the earth in one hour.

210
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:11,243
How long do you think it can take
for a lawyer to track them?

211
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:14,283
With the law we have today, ten years.

212
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,003
Excuse me.

213
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:27,563
I can get money to show up
or disappear as I want.

214
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:35,203
But that is exactly what I do not like.

215
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:39,763
The real estate and the houses are standing.

216
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:45,683
But the money we conjure up or conjure away.

217
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:48,683
Be honest.

218
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:54,683
What happened to the Finnish
bonds? We need them.

219
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:58,803
It takes a few days to release them.

220
00:24:58,883 --> 00:25:03,803
We can look at it together.
Yes, we do.

221
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:07,403
Because I do not like magician.

222
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:13,163
- Reply now. It may be important.
- No, you is important.

223
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:21,403
What's going on?
- An irregularity.

224
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:25,443
A detail in the sustainability index.

225
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:31,163
- A detail? How could this happen?
- It was a slip.

226
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:36,723
- Salba is worthless without debate,
- We ask the auditor.

227
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:42,043
- What's his name?
- Sivieri. Luigi Sivieri.

228
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,243
Idiot!

229
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:58,283
- Master.
- Fuck you.

230
00:25:58,363 --> 00:26:03,003
- Do you have spoiled the debate?
- I'll fix it.

231
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,003
Now it's your problem.

232
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:26,003
You're late.
- I got no notice.

233
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,723
I have created a miracle.

234
00:26:42,843 --> 00:26:45,283
Accountant Sivieri?

235
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:48,083
- Have we met?
- No.

236
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:51,843
But we are both interested in Salba.

237
00:26:51,923 --> 00:26:56,963
- Who are you?
- Someone who will open the debate.

238
00:26:57,043 --> 00:27:00,763
Excuse me.

239
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:05,483
If you adjust the audit
you will be well rewarded.

240
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:10,843
- You got the wrong guy.
- You will get 100,000 euros.

241
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:23,763
- Listen.
- Get off me.

242
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:28,683
You get more when it's done.

243
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:32,923
Think about it.
I'll call this afternoon.

244
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:57,043
Mom, I could not stay in Milan.

245
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:03,923
- So you gift?
- Yes.

246
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:09,323
- Do you like it?
- It's fine.

247
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:12,363
Do not worry, Mom.

248
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:26,883
You, Ciro.

249
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:33,643
It's done.

250
00:28:33,723 --> 00:28:37,083
The money is coming.

251
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:43,723
Genna, I've thought about it.

252
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:49,883
We should administer the money.
I do not trust Baroncino.

253
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:55,043
He says he buys dope
for 20 euros, but it's not true.

254
00:28:55,123 --> 00:29:01,283
He pays half, and we get
garbage. Therefore, we sell poorly.

255
00:29:01,363 --> 00:29:05,523
But he has always stood for it.

256
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:11,003
Who do you trust? Who?

257
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,923
- Him or me?
- You.

258
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:20,803
Let me handle money matters.
Relax.

259
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:25,403
Genna. This is our moment.
Do you understand?

260
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:30,923
We need to change everything, you and me.
We turn up and down on it all.

261
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,083
Up and down.

262
00:29:36,723 --> 00:29:40,083
Do you want a cigarette?

263
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:47,763
Give me a kiss.

264
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:06,363
Accountant Sivieri, it's me.
What do you think?

265
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:11,323
Hello? Hello?

266
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:33,963
- I was getting Noemis gift.
- Do you go back?

267
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:37,283
Genna...

268
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:41,883
Do you understand that father is inside?
The two of us tonight now.

269
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:48,163
- Do not worry, I've mastered it.
- How?

270
00:30:48,243 --> 00:30:53,203
When the money comes,
We must rid ourselves of Baroncino.

271
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:59,443
What do you mean?
- His shit products sell poorly.

272
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:04,323
Is this something you've figured out
or is it Ciro again?

273
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:07,203
- No.
- No?

274
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,643
It figured myself out.

275
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:37,283
You do not know who you are dealing with.
You can not say no.

276
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:42,883
- For your own, your family's
and your three children's sake.

277
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:49,163
Take this money and do it,
you must. And do it quickly.

278
00:32:12,803 --> 00:32:15,843
- Hello.
- Signora.

279
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:19,203
Good day. We're looking for Franco Musi.

280
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:24,403
- Who is it?
- Musi? We have a warrant.

281
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:44,043
See what the idiot has done!

282
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:49,603
First he stole our money.

283
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:53,043
So it was a hell to get them back.

284
00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:57,043
And now he's been notified.

285
00:32:57,123 --> 00:33:01,603
- The giant idiot.
What happens now?

286
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:06,603
Yes, what do you think?
What do you think happens?

287
00:33:06,683 --> 00:33:11,083
I want him out of jail.
The lawyer already.

288
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:16,163
I want him out,
before he sticks us all together.

289
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:22,163
So finally succeeded
for him to destroy it all.

290
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:32,043
Tell them I'll take care of it.
Can not happen.

291
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:38,163
Take it easy, Musi.
It will be all right all along.

292
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:43,963
I have applied for release.
It will probably be granted.

293
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:48,803
Thank you. When?
- On some days.

294
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:53,723
You just take it easy.

295
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:18,803
He will not say anything, and when he
at home, he can not be broken.

296
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:25,443
The problem is the 100,000. It caused
suspicion of money laundering.

297
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:30,723
The prosecutor sent a letter of request
to Switzerland, but it takes time.

298
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:36,163
- But the Swiss have found something.
What?

299
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:44,283
- Public Trustee's accounts.
- Idiot. It is our money.

300
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:47,483
- If you have confiscated them?
- Not yet.

301
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:51,563
But when the Close scrutiny
the letter of request-

302
00:34:51,643 --> 00:34:55,883
-Confiscate all accounts.

303
00:34:56,923 --> 00:35:03,723
Donna Imma, I do not know how much
they feel that if they start looking.

304
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,923
What should we do?

305
00:35:08,003 --> 00:35:14,403
Everything that they have found so far,
do we have to disappear.

306
00:35:20,563 --> 00:35:25,083
- How?
- Frankly speaking...

307
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:32,443
I'm technician. I come
Technical and theoretical solutions.

308
00:35:32,523 --> 00:35:38,803
- I am not a counselor. Do you understand?
- Yes.

309
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:55,803
Why, donna Imma?

310
00:35:56,483 --> 00:36:00,323
Why do you say that?

311
00:36:00,403 --> 00:36:03,803
- I can promise you that...
- Mr.

312
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:09,603
You can not promise me anything.
And we can not take the risk.

313
00:36:11,563 --> 00:36:17,323
I know I fucked up.
But I can make amends.

314
00:36:17,403 --> 00:36:21,563
All accounts transferred to your wife,
and you open them.

315
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:27,563
Then we can get our money,
before the state confiscates them.

316
00:36:28,763 --> 00:36:32,283
Do not cry.

317
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:35,963
Think of the child who is coming.

318
00:36:37,203 --> 00:36:41,563
And your daughter. I've seen her.

319
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:45,443
You're happy for her.
- Yes.

320
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:48,403
You can see that.

321
00:36:48,763 --> 00:36:53,403
You have to to do it for their sake.

322
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:57,283
Then they can be comfortable.

323
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:03,163
Trust me.
It is the only solution.

324
00:37:03,683 --> 00:37:08,883
I give you my word.
They'll never be short of something.

325
00:37:09,403 --> 00:37:12,323
Never.

326
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:15,923
Never.

327
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:11,043
- Perla.
Hey, Franco.

328
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,443
- Congratulations.
Thank you.

329
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:17,163
Can I talk to you? Sorry.

330
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:23,003
- Has something happened?
- No.

331
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:26,403
No, it is out of order.
- Sure?

332
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:29,763
Yes, excuse me.
Can we get pie?

333
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:35,003
Yeah, I get it.
- I turn off the light.

334
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:57,803
Mother.

335
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:04,683
- You look tired.
Yes, a little.

336
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:08,723
- Now you can rest.
- No.

337
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:12,043
I have to visit your father.

338
00:41:13,043 --> 00:41:16,483
Are you coming with me?

339
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:21,283
- Can I talk to him?
- No.

340
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:24,643
It was the first time-

341
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:27,963
-But now there is only move a person into.

342
00:41:28,043 --> 00:41:34,363
Okay, take off.
He would probably rather see you. See you.

343
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:37,763
See you...

344
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:42,003
Why can not you see him?

345
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:47,363
It is you who must see him.
Do not let mom take over.

346
00:41:47,443 --> 00:41:53,923
You should talk to your father, not her.
It's you who decides.

347
00:41:55,203 --> 00:41:59,843
- Is it me who decides?
- Yes.

348
00:41:59,923 --> 00:42:03,403
Yes, it is me who decides.

349
00:42:03,483 --> 00:42:08,363
Why dictates all so, what to do?

350
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,843
Genny, do your. Genny, do that.

351
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:16,443
I'm damn tired of it.
Can you believe it?

352
00:42:16,523 --> 00:42:19,123
I decide.

353
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:24,043
And I decide
that you must follow mother to prison.

354
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:27,283
Go.

355
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:33,883
Genny can turn it on.

356
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:37,843
- Do not you swim?
- Now we light it.

357
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:40,883
You can even swim.

358
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:11,043
Gennaro is a good man.

359
00:43:11,123 --> 00:43:14,883
It is clear.
But he grows with you.

360
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:20,443
He is a great boss.

361
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:23,403
As his father.

362
00:43:28,243 --> 00:43:32,843
I have mastered it.
Do not worry.

363
00:43:33,483 --> 00:43:38,443
I talked to the lawyer,
so I know everything.

364
00:43:43,803 --> 00:43:48,083
Imma, I'm tired.

365
00:43:48,923 --> 00:43:52,403
Perhaps it is time to retreat.

366
00:43:54,403 --> 00:43:58,203
Is Genny still with the girl?

367
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:07,803
He's good.
Has been a real man, my son.

368
00:44:07,883 --> 00:44:13,923
Your son still can not find a good woman.

369
00:44:14,003 --> 00:44:20,083
She is not right for him.
A mother knows something.

370
00:44:20,163 --> 00:44:24,563
- I know.
- Imma... He decides.

371
00:44:28,483 --> 00:44:35,043
And he can always ask Ciro.
Ciro expert on women.

372
00:44:35,123 --> 00:44:38,203
Do you understand?

373
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:46,083
Do you understand?

374
00:44:49,163 --> 00:44:51,563
Good.

375
00:44:51,643 --> 00:44:55,283
Then I can retire.

376
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:52,723
He seemed to have a good time,
and he knows what he wants.

377
00:45:55,563 --> 00:45:59,563
He also said you have to do.

378
00:45:59,643 --> 00:46:04,683
- You're going to Spain.
- For Spain?

379
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:08,483
Yes. You need to make peace with Conte.

380
00:46:08,563 --> 00:46:13,243
We must sell his goods again.

381
00:46:22,923 --> 00:46:26,083
Then it's done.

382
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:47,883
