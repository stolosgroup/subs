2
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:55,898
They should be dusted thoroughly.

3
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:59,538
-Hello.
-Hey, Giacobone.

4
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,738
Franco, give me a month.

5
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:06,138
They want to move.

6
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:11,058
Giacobone, why have you
need a month?

7
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:14,738
Come on ...

8
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:32,458
I go to bed. Good night, Dad.

9
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:10,378
<i> -Mom, it's Genny. </ i>
-How are you?

10
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,058
<i> -"Celebration" went well. </ i>
-When are you coming?

11
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:19,258
<i> I'm in the jungle among the animals. </ i>
They are worse than gypsies.

12
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:22,698
Yes? They liked "gift"?

13
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:27,778
<i> -They did not get it. </ i>
-It's from the "Thousand and One Nights".

14
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:31,698
<i> -"Thousand and One Nights" </ i>
-Yes.

15
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:36,338
<i> -Non thousand and three hundred </ i>
-They have never had one before.

16
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:40,338
<i> -They let me go. </ i>
-A thousand, not more.

17
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:45,698
<i> What do you say? </ i>
Can you believe they let me go?

18
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:01,058
Wait. Maria, can you stop?

19
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:29,738
Are you with me?

20
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:33,618
Do you want it? Come on.

21
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:38,498
Come with me.
Do not be afraid of me.

22
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:47,578
Do you have a name?
Or should we baptize you?

23
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:55,498
Or should we baptize you?

24
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:03,098
I have something
important to say to all of you.

25
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:08,778
-The first shipment is on the way.
-Should not we wait for Ciro?

26
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:13,378
Ciro is not invited.

27
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:19,018
If the price is in euros per gram.
The quality and the journey goes well--

28
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:23,978
-We can lower the price by 20%.

29
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:29,058
20%? Are you sure?
So we all get to us.

30
00:05:30,018 --> 00:05:37,018
The risk we must run. We need
new places, the police do not know.

31
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:41,258
We must be
dedicated and kind to people--

32
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:45,738
-So the street again
is filled with junkies and police.

33
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:52,458
Then open the door for the ladies police.

34
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:57,178
Quiet, donna Imma.
We can always find new places.

35
00:05:57,258 --> 00:06:01,498
-I sent one of the boys.
-We go together.

36
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:16,858
-Can we talk?
-Not now, Ciro.

37
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:22,418
-Should I not at the meeting?
-Wait.

38
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:26,618
Relax.

39
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:33,258
-I have a suggestion.
-I'd like to hear.

40
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:38,858
Good. You will hear from me.
Come beautiful.

41
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:47,138
That's it.

42
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:52,618
-Here it is.
-It's fine.

43
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:55,178
Like it?

44
00:06:55,258 --> 00:07:01,098
We are guaranteed this place.
I know people here.

45
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:06,738
Do all the cellars?
They are empty and will not be used.

46
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:10,618
We take them and put guards there.

47
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:15,898
Some of the balconies and the roof.
Police get us never.

48
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,098
It is a fortress, donna Imma.

49
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:22,538
-Sorry. Imma Savastano?
-Yes.

50
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:28,138
A pleasure, I'm Luca Giacobone.
Can we talk?

51
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:37,978
What a beautiful view.
It has an interesting views.

52
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:44,138
What would you talk to me about?

53
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:47,578
Go ahead and sit down.

54
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:53,698
Do you know Franco Martucci?
He called Leccalecca.

55
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:59,018
-Loan Shark? I know him.
-My father had wedding dress shop.

56
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:01,898
It went badly.

57
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,898
Leccalecca lent him 20,000 euros.
Now he will have interest.

58
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:11,258
After three months,
it was 70,000 euros.

59
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:15,178
Two weeks ago
he shot himself in the head.

60
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:19,258
Everyone knows who you are.

61
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:23,098
Therefore, I ask for help.

62
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:31,418
-What do you think I can do?
-Tell him that we do not have the money.

63
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:48,218
-Signora Imma.
-Franco.

64
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:52,658
Has something happened?
What do I owe the honor?

65
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:57,738
-Nothing in particular. Can I sit?
-Here you go.

66
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:03,058
I come on behalf of a girl.
She lost her father recently.

67
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:07,578
-His name was Giacobone.
-I know who it is.

68
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:12,618
She is a disgusting and filthy dyke.

69
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:18,058
The father was a desperate dog
who had no control over the money.

70
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:21,418
He owed me 70,000 euros.

71
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:27,338
And he thought
that death is canceled debt.

72
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:31,098
But no.

73
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:37,178
How much interest run on?

74
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:40,378
First it was 50%.

75
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,218
Then it was 70%.

76
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:48,098
70%?

77
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:52,738
Is that how you work?

78
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:58,458
We are risking jail
and you earn money from it.

79
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:08,058
Listen carefully, Leccalecca.
I say this only once.

80
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:11,818
Now there are new rules.

81
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,458
Do you understand?

82
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:38,458
-Hello.
-Hey, Ciro. I have good news.

83
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:43,338
-Finally.
-You will be responsible for the new trading post.

84
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:47,698
-Is it a place?
-This is your big moment.

85
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:52,938
-It's something for the boys.
-So help of the boys.

86
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:57,258
I think I deserve better.

87
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:01,938
It is the best I have now.

88
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:06,138
You have two days to open the site.

89
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:13,538
-Do you think about it?
-See you.

90
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,578
-What did she say?
-Gennaro is coming soon.

91
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:33,778
The bitch ruin everything.

92
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:55,378
-What happened?
-I'm dead if I do not pay.

93
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:08,458
Is not some nice glasses?
American from the NATO base.

94
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:12,698
-Do you like them?
-There he is.

95
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:30,218
Signora Imma,
you can not do this to me.

96
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:33,898
I'm not one of your boys.

97
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:39,218
Want to see what they can do to you,
Franco Leccalecca?

98
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:44,218
Come on.

99
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:47,458
Got a light, Zecchinetta?

100
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,018
-Hello.
-Hello.

101
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:57,498
-Mother. He borrows our window a bit.
-Why?

102
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:02,498
-Immacolata Savastano sent me.
-What are you?

103
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:07,858
Sorry, I take a chair
and put me here.

104
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:10,618
-The delicious.
-Yes.

105
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:15,058
-One of the boys can do it.
-Thank you, maybe.

106
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:22,178
What a view. It is as Posillipo.
You can clearly see if the police come.

107
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:27,258
There is change in six hours.
May I have a cup of coffee, please?

108
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:33,138
Can you hear me?

109
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:35,538
All clear.

110
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:44,378
Marta, they are beautiful.

111
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,458
Dad had good taste.

112
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:53,418
-Why do you want of them?
-Mom does not call his foot here.

113
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:57,818
-Why do not you work here?
-I? Never.

114
00:16:57,898 --> 00:17:02,658
It was the dream,
that killed the father.

115
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:05,938
Okay, so.

116
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:10,858
So mom will find a buyer.

117
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:14,978
-We find the one that will buy.
-Thank you.

118
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:23,378
You can not get past.

119
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:27,018
Get off, you have to go.

120
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:37,658
Okay.

121
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:50,058
-Wait here. Go out.

122
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,338
Break out the hand.

123
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,738
Faster.

124
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:10,658
So wait, however. Shut up.

125
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:18,258
Come here. Shut. Give me the money.

126
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:24,098
-Be careful. The police come after you.
-I'll show him ...

127
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:27,738
In driving me crazy.

128
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:32,258
You keep your mouth shut. People sleep.

129
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:37,498
-Faster.
-Easy, Ciro.

130
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:49,058
-Open.
-Come on.

131
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:53,778
Be careful with money. Close.

132
00:18:58,098 --> 00:18:59,858
So.

133
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:04,818
Wait.

134
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:12,578
They need to shut up.
They need to shut up.

135
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:22,738
Who is it? Stop that.
Away with your hands.

136
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:26,898
I'll kick your ass. Shut up.

137
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:32,618
Open the door. Fast

138
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:51,658
Ciro. Do not worry.

139
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:10,858
-You know what happened last night?
-No.

140
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:15,178
Some smashed Madonna statue.

141
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:18,218
Take it easy. I'll take care of it.

142
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:24,818
No. This time
it is best that I intervene.

143
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:29,018
I have something important to say.

144
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:34,258
-Have you heard from Genny?
-It's too dangerous to talk to him.

145
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:39,458
But we have found
body of a man down there.

146
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:47,458
-Do you know who this is?
-Only that there was a white man.

147
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:51,218
And the body had been dismembered.

148
00:20:54,498 --> 00:21:00,898
I think they're bluffing. They do not get
something out of breaking the agreement.

149
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:08,298
What do you think?
Should we change the offer?

150
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:16,058
No. Bid remains the same.

151
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:24,938
All clear.

152
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:54,018
Come on.

153
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:10,458
Hello, donna Imma.
Come and see what has happened.

154
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:15,178
-Hello.
-Hello.

155
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:21,578
We have no idea what to do.
Look what they did to Madonna.

156
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:26,978
-Help us donna Imma.
-Tomorrow, In a new statue.

157
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:30,058
Okay? See you.

158
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:36,458
I want you to meet
my daughter. Do you follow?

159
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:41,138
Yeah, let's go. Come on, baby.

160
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:48,698
-We need to talk.
-About what?

161
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:52,378
I have receipts with.

162
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:58,898
<i> -Do you have them with me </ i>
-If you want them, they are there.

163
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:06,498
-This is my daughter.
-Hello.

164
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:09,778
Wait here.

165
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:12,898
She made it here.

166
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:19,498
We need to find a job for her.
She would really like to work.

167
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:24,138
-You can probably find something.
-I will.

168
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:31,858
-Move you a little bit.
-Now comes the dessert.

169
00:23:31,938 --> 00:23:38,818
-Tell Imma that we share the money.
-She says it does not have to be crazy.

170
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:43,418
There will be two thousand people.
We are fifteen.

171
00:23:43,498 --> 00:23:49,658
-I'm just saying what she said.
-Say we want a bonus.

172
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:52,778
-Not now.
-What's your name?

173
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:57,378
-Luca.
-Are you a girl or a boy?

174
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:01,778
-Do you have a knob?
-Yours is probably small.

175
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:06,618
-Do you feel it?
-Spare me the bullshit and remember ...

176
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:10,378
... That manliness
sitting here and not there.

177
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:17,058
-Can not you shut up?
-Hurry up, I do not want more.

178
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:24,858
-We need to do it properly.
-Get my car. I'm coming soon.

179
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:29,338
No need to say, we are problems.
Do you understand, Toni?

180
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:34,018
Above all, we must not
have a commotion that night.

181
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:38,658
Do not have a helmet on the scooter--

182
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:44,298
-And the car you have your hands on the wheel
and the lights on. Always.

183
00:24:44,378 --> 00:24:47,418
Have you understood Trak?

184
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:48,138
They would kill me.

185
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:52,858
-Ciro, we are with you.
-They do not like competition.

186
00:25:52,938 --> 00:25:56,058
Relax.

187
00:25:56,138 --> 00:26:02,178
-I can go alone in the war.
-It is not intended for you.

188
00:26:02,258 --> 00:26:08,538
-You do not worry, I see.
-What do you see? What do you mean?

189
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:12,578
Do you really think
that it was about you?

190
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:17,658
Ciro di Marzio, they do not care
you. Do you understand that?

191
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:23,458
They do not care about us.
With the whole family Savastano.

192
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:30,218
Yes, but we can not be complacent.
We must turn back hard.

193
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,658
-It was Martoni, these assholes.
-I know them.

194
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:38,418
-I and Rosario takes them.
-Malamore do it.

195
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:43,778
-I'd be.
-You do as I say.

196
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:49,458
Go and watch the business.
The meeting is over.

197
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:52,938
Come on, Mary.

198
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:41,778
See, Mary loves you.

199
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:46,658
See her light on earth

200
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:51,498
open your heart to love

201
00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:56,498
and carry it on your way

202
00:27:56,578 --> 00:28:00,978
sing with us Maria

203
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:05,738
queen and mother are you

204
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:10,578
hear my prayers

205
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:14,498
the dangers I do not love anymore

206
00:28:29,698 --> 00:28:34,018
and carry it on your way

207
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:39,298
sing with us Maria

208
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:44,098
queen and mother are you

209
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:48,738
now hear my prayers

210
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:54,018
the dangers I do not love anymore

211
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:58,778
greetings Maria hear me

212
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:03,378
let it reach down to us

213
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:07,498
all your great love

214
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:13,858
-This team is ready now.
-We are late.

215
00:29:13,938 --> 00:29:18,618
-They are ready. Business is bad.
-What a fucking chaos.

216
00:29:18,698 --> 00:29:22,218
-Go now.
-Goodbye.

217
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:29,378
No noise during the procession.
But we must work carefully.

218
00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:11,418
-Can not sleep?
-Oh yes, I can.

219
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:15,578
I'm just a little tired.

220
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:20,378
-You look worn out.
-Oh no ...

221
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:26,938
I'm just worried about Genny.
You know your son.

222
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:33,218
I do not know what he
has been up to lately.

223
00:30:35,578 --> 00:30:41,858
Say, if I make it right with Genny.
Commits I error to our son?

224
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:46,498
Imma I've had a dream.

225
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:51,978
-A dream?
-I dreamed that I could fly.

226
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:59,738
You were also,
and below us there were lots of animals.

227
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:05,458
There were lions ...
And Genny was there too!

228
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:09,778
He had his bicycle.

229
00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:15,378
-Genny is a good boy.
-Yes, he is.

230
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:27,498
Imma.

231
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:36,818
Do not be afraid.

232
00:31:37,658 --> 00:31:41,698
No, do not worry.

233
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:44,658
I'm not afraid.

234
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:48,458
I'm not afraid.

235
00:32:01,698 --> 00:32:05,138
Let me out of here!

236
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:27,138
Help! Please help me!

237
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:29,978
Help!

238
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,738
Help!

239
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:21,378
-Here.
-Count thoroughly.

240
00:34:25,618 --> 00:34:29,298
Maria! Maria!

241
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:33,378
-Maria!
-Maria!

242
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:38,938
Maria!

243
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:26,258
Run, run!

244
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:41,938
-Run!
-Come on!

245
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:46,178
-Move it!
-Save that one!

246
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:51,298
-Put it on top!
-Come on!

247
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:17,298
Close, Rosario!

248
00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:40,978
<i> authorities tighten grip </ i>
On Naples, especially with regard to drugs.

249
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:46,258
<i> There are probably related </ i>
for the murder of Marta Giacobone--

250
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:50,898
<i> -who was gunned down </ i>
middle of the day in a butcher shop.

251
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:54,738
<i> girl may be a victim </ i>
an act of revenge ...

252
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:58,978
We'll fix a meeting first. No war.

253
00:36:59,058 --> 00:37:05,018
If they want to kill us all,
be the first to hear my proposal.

254
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:10,938
-Safe? It is a sign of weakness.
-I said:

255
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:17,178
A meeting when they can and where they want.
It may well be with them.

256
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:24,218
Don Pietro Savastano would not
have accepted such a thing.

257
00:37:26,498 --> 00:37:31,778
And where is Gennaro?
Is he alive? Where the hell is he?

258
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:38,978
Why do you care about that?
What's with him?

259
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:44,858
Do you think it will go better,
when Gennaro come back?

260
00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:50,218
You need to be where I am saying.
And you must tie styles.

261
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:58,258
Go on.

262
00:37:58,338 --> 00:38:01,418
Get out!

263
00:38:01,498 --> 00:38:03,938
Goodbye.

264
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:38,738
I do not want war.
No blood, no police after me.

265
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:44,258
But everyone should appreciate
on Gennys work in Honduras.

266
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:48,698
We can offer
excellent quality at spot prices

267
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:53,258
-And consignments
come regularly and safely.

268
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:57,098
All this
thanks to my son, Genny.

269
00:38:57,178 --> 00:39:03,738
If you want, we can sell to you
at an attractive price.

270
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:08,538
But we've done the rough work.

271
00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:14,138
And therefore we are the ones
I make the rules. Period.

272
00:39:15,658 --> 00:39:21,618
If you want, you can declare war on us.

273
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:35,858
I know what you're thinking.

274
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:43,658
I divide people into those who do not
kill and those who kill.

275
00:39:43,738 --> 00:39:49,778
And because I'm a woman, do you think
I belong to the first group.

276
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:54,578
But that was in error.

277
00:41:35,698 --> 00:41:40,058
I ought to kill you too.

278
00:42:04,498 --> 00:42:08,498
