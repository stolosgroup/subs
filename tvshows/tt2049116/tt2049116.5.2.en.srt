2
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,200
Here's the check.

3
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,240
I'll pay.

4
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,280
Why didn't you come back?

5
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,680
The person who sent me here said
it was the only way to save you,

6
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,280
so you and your family
could live in peace.

7
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,000
You saw what happened to the person
who sent you here.

8
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,960
Let's go back to Naples now, Ciro.

9
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Me and you.

10
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,560
We'll settle everything together.

11
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,240
I'm not going back, Genna'.

12
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,520
There's no going back.

13
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,280
The world I knew doesn't exist anymore.

14
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,040
Everything I loved is destroyed,

15
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,720
what was worth living for is dead.

16
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, I still believe in it.

17
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,880
I thought it was the same for you
but I was wrong.

18
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,360
What happens now
that Don Aniello's dead?

19
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,920
Tonight I'm meeting
the new Russian contact,

20
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,520
I gotta explain to him
why the drugs aren't coming.

21
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,440
- It's a problem for me.
- I'll come with you tonight.

22
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,600
We'll introduce him to his new supplier.

23
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,600
If you could do it all over,
what would you do?

24
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,200
Everything I did,
even giving my life for you.

25
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,880
But then you left me on my own.

26
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,160
I did it to protect you.

27
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,200
You don't know what it feels like
to think you killed a brother.

28
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,120
- Dimitri!
- Ciro!

29
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
This is Gennaro Savastano.

30
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,680
I bet 5,000 euros on him.

31
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,120
Really!

32
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,680
Ilya Kurianov.
Ciro Di Marzio.

33
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,240
I've heard great things
about you, Ciro Di Marzio.

34
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,960
We were in the secret service together.

35
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,000
The market's expanding.

36
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,680
Word of your quality and prices

37
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,760
has spread as far as St Petersburg.

38
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,920
How much do you need?

39
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,680
100.

40
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,080
Is 100kg too much to start with?

41
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,880
Not a problem.

42
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
He's your broker from today.

43
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,240
He's the best in the world.

44
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,200
Ilya, it's a stroke of luck
to have you with us.

45
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,760
Two strokes of luck.

46
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,600
The pleasure of seeing a friend again

47
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,120
and that of meeting
new business partners.

48
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,440
Let's make a toast
with our best champagne.

49
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,560
What did you say to him?

50
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,080
That my friend is the best
in the world in his field.

51
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,200
Friendship is the best thing that exists,

52
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,400
having a friend is better
than having a woman.

53
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,000
Love for a friend is absolute.

54
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,080
But a friend's always
gotta be sincere, loyal.

55
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,760
If a friend betrays you,
is he still a friend?

56
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,080
I've never betrayed you.

57
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,240
What a great night!

58
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,280
We've made an excellent deal,

59
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
with good friends.

60
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,840
Move it.

61
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,640
Faster!

62
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,600
Gimme your belt.

63
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
C'mon.

64
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,680
Ring and necklace.

65
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
The necklace.

66
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
You know what this place is?

67
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,120
They call it a gulag.

68
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,840
It's like a prison, but not only.

69
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,640
It's a place of atonement,

70
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,880
of suffering.

71
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,960
You only get out of here
after paying for all your sins.

72
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,920
And that often happens after you die.

73
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,040
Why are you doing this to me?

74
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,920
Why?

75
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,040
Are you serious?

76
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,720
Because when I needed you,
you didn't give a shit.

77
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,640
You abandoned me
and didn't give a fuck.

78
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,320
You said it yourself, no?
Our world is dead.

79
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,480
I'm dead.

80
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,440
You wanted to go on by yourself
as always, ditching everyone.

81
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,640
But this time I'm stopping you.

82
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,360
You're making
the biggest mistake of your life.

83
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,200
I contacted the Russian before I came.

84
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,040
I reimbursed him for the shipment
you and your friend stole,

85
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,080
that's how we became partners.

86
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,560
But before getting to all this,
I had to look you in the eye,

87
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,520
I had to understand.

88
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,240
From now on they'll take care of you.

89
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,880
You'll spend every day
of your life in here,

90
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,920
without knowing if it's morning
or night, rainy or sunny.

91
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,880
They'll give you food, water,

92
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,000
if you're sick they'll look after you.

93
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,400
You'll grow old thinking of the people

94
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,800
who loved you but you killed them.

95
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,840
Like Deborah.

96
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,000
Like Maria Rita.

97
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,360
And like me.

98
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,600
I would have shared the world with you.

99
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,120
You've never been able
to keep up with me.

100
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,720
You're still that kid
that wakes up scared,

101
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,720
that can't sleep at night

102
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,320
and wakes up crying for help.

103
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
You're still the wrong son
of that father.

104
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,480
Don Pietro had more respect for me

105
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,760
when I killed him
than he ever did for you.

106
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,880
That's why you're locking me in here,
you know, right?

107
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,320
As long as I'm around,
you'll always come second.

108
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,760
Pray that I never get out of here.

109
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,240
Not eating, you son of a bitch?

110
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Get up!

111
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Not even my dog would eat this shit.

112
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,400
Igor, get in here!

113
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,000
Untie him!

114
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,160
Hurry up.

115
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,720
If he dies we're fucked.

116
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,640
- We gotta let Kurianov know.
- Go, I'll stay here with him.

117
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,640
Viktor!

118
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,760
- He escaped, we gotta find him!
- Hurry, fuck!

119
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,000
Careful, he's armed.

120
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,240
Quick!

121
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,280
He went that way!

122
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,160
He ran into the woods!

123
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,760
<i>He's heading for the river.</i>

124
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,440
Who are you? What do you want?

125
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,640
Here.

126
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,280
You like it?

127
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,600
I made it.

128
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,080
Thank you.

129
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,920
It's very good.

130
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,120
Have some bread too.

131
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,640
You can rest before you leave.

132
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,520
They're still looking for me,

133
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,120
it's not safe.

134
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,000
The woods aren't safe at night,
it's better if you stay.

135
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,160
Good evening.

136
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,920
We're looking for a man,

137
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,240
an Italian.

138
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,400
We haven't seen anyone.

139
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,640
Look inside!

140
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,960
One in there and the other over there.

141
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,480
- I didn't say you could go in.
- I don't trust you.

142
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,360
Latvian shitbag!

143
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,560
Goodbye.

144
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,840
Take care.

145
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,760
Where will you go?

146
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,600
To visit a friend.

147
00:44:14,305 --> 00:45:14,696
