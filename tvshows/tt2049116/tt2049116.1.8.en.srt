2
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:21,544
Genny, all right?

3
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:28,024
--I have not slept in two days.
--Do you still have jet lag?

4
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:33,904
It is nerves.

5
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:58,504
--All right?
He's in top form.

6
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:02,144
My darling ...

7
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:08,904
You're thin as a model.

8
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:13,704
Getting down to work.
Come on, boys.

9
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:19,744
--So we eat something together one evening.
--We all go away.

10
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:24,664
I'm glad to see you.

11
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:29,104
What?
--You came here three days ago.

12
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:33,824
And showing you now?
--I would relax a little.

13
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,904
Shall we go for a ride?

14
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:41,544
I must get hold of a pair of
guys. I must do something.

15
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:44,704
Is there something wrong?
--No.

16
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:49,104
--Good. See you, Ciro.
--Genna ...

17
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:56,384
I have been placed
among these fucking junkies.

18
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:59,984
It is not for me.

19
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:07,384
--We need to talk. Do you hear?
--See you, Ciro.

20
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:44,504
Hi, Genna. Where have you been?

21
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:49,784
--We need to talk.
--We take a stroke. Long time no see.

22
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:53,784
Throw that shit away.
I want to talk, I said.

23
00:03:53,864 --> 00:04:00,704
--What do you say?
--Can all of you not to go outside? Thank you.

24
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:07,224
It may be important.

25
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:12,464
You must make up
as mayoral candidate in Giugliano.

26
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,624
No problem.
I can also be president.

27
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:21,184
What the hell are you laughing at? What?

28
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:26,464
--You mean it.
--Fabbretti is an old asshole.

29
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:29,904
We need young people like you.

30
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:35,344
But Fabbretti all behind him.
We have always supported him.

31
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:41,024
What kind of man are you?
Have you no dignity?

32
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:47,384
I got 900 votes to
municipal elections. Fabbretti was 30,000.

33
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:53,824
It'll be embarrassing.
--Not with me. Do you understand?

34
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:56,664
Look at me.

35
00:04:57,824 --> 00:05:03,104
You are good enough.
Everybody likes you in Giugliano.

36
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:10,184
Tomorrow we're printing your posters.
We make a list of all the young people.

37
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:17,864
Then we find those who can provide
votes. You have to reach in.

38
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:24,064
--Do I have a choice, Genna?
What do you think?

39
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:28,904
--We are making an effort.
It's not an experiment.

40
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:34,304
I will make you mayor,
but you have to believe it.

41
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:39,784
I believe that tomorrow.
Now I'll take a line.

42
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:45,144
Hey, Miche.
Hey, Genny.

43
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:48,544
Come on, let's go.

44
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:32,544
Quietly, I do not wanna hear it.

45
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:37,144
If we're talking, it ends up wrong.

46
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:40,584
No, now we're talking.

47
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:44,424
What's wrong?

48
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:51,064
--Do you think that I have taken your place?
--Shut up.

49
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:13,944
Shall we order deep for everyone?
We'll have to wait for donna Imma.

50
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:18,664
We are not waiting for anyone.
You can talk to me.

51
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:22,184
Hurry,
I have other things to do.

52
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:29,544
Then we started. With goods from
Honduras, we control the market now.

53
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:32,864
We thank you for your work.

54
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:37,184
Genna, is that you?
It is ten years ago.

55
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:42,024
--How are you, Mino?
--I came out two weeks ago.

56
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:46,664
I work as a dishwasher.
You may be able to help me?

57
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:52,384
--I am busy. We take it later.
--We went to the same school.

58
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:58,664
You were called "pepper"
for you were thick and blushed.

59
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,864
--Do you remember that?
--Yes, I can.

60
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:07,944
But I have to do something.
I'll call you later.

61
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:10,344
Okay.

62
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:16,304
--Where did we come from?
--You have invited Ciro.

63
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:20,624
He has not been
so much with the large trades.

64
00:08:20,704 --> 00:08:26,984
But he is one of your best friends.
He should be more of.

65
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:37,344
Have you asked
one of your friends plead your case?

66
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:44,104
Genna. We have much experience.
It has been on the street.

67
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:49,384
--We grew up with your father.
--We should focus on what's important.

68
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:58,464
There are choices in Giugliano.
While building a transport center.

69
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:01,704
We're covered. Fabbretti's.

70
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:07,544
500 cold stores, movie theater, bowling.
In addition, a police station.

71
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:12,344
A train station. 6,000 jobs to us.

72
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:16,584
We get a share.
Fabbretti have always supported us.

73
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:21,624
I will not share more, Zecchinetta.
I want it all.

74
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:27,144
Do you think that it's just us?
Everyone should have food on the table.

75
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:33,864
I have paid.

76
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:41,424
--Come, Mino.
--This is going to hell ...

77
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:55,504
What the hell are you doing?
--What do we do with him?

78
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:58,784
Take this.

79
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:09,184
Are you all right, Ciro?
Do it properly.

80
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:16,944
He's not crazy.

81
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:20,904
Come on, let s go.

82
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:27,344
--Genna! Genna!
--Wait.

83
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:35,744
This is our moment
but you treat me like shit.

84
00:10:35,824 --> 00:10:42,064
Have you forgotten what I've done
for you? We are brothers.

85
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:46,784
I have not forgotten it.
But we're not brothers.

86
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:50,184
I am Pietro's son, I take over.

87
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:54,384
It is clear.
But I will work with you.

88
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:59,424
No, Ciro.
So it will be business as usual.

89
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:04,544
I have to prove to the others,
I can handle it myself.

90
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:09,664
Beware.
If you go solo, it will be your death.

91
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:15,664
Maybe. Do not be angry, Cir×©.
It's my turn now.

92
00:11:32,744 --> 00:11:36,984
We have 3,000 flyers and 500 posters.

93
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:42,384
Tonight, put
posters throughout Giugliano.

94
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:48,424
Share you up. I do not see
Fabbrettis face longer.

95
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:53,504
Give me two boxes.

96
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:59,664
--Where do we start?
--This is my neighborhood.

97
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:05,344
--Empire, communists, students.
--What are our options?

98
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:11,144
--Rings.
--Then we have something to do.

99
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:14,504
Get started.

100
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:30,624
Hey, Daniele.
Hey.

101
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,664
Hey, Ciro.
--Head?

102
00:12:54,744 --> 00:13:00,544
--He's not here yet.
--Can I park it with you?

103
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:06,984
--I do best Triumph.
--It does not run.

104
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:14,824
--It must be the spark.
--Check it carefully.

105
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:19,304
--I hope it is in good hands.
--That's it.

106
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:23,544
Hey, Daniele.
--See you.

107
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:50,864
--Who is he?
--Gaetano Salemi, builder.

108
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:54,024
He has not worked in two years.

109
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:58,224
If they are angry, it is good for us.

110
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:04,504
Fabbretti gave me a promise.
I'll get 3,000 votes.

111
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:08,984
And we all share contracts.

112
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:13,184
Equally? The devil either.

113
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:18,224
--Why are we here.
--Do you endorse my candidacy?

114
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:24,584
Back up? I support no. I'm
been taken in the ass too many times.

115
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:29,864
--We give you our word of honor.
--Parole? What do you mean? Honor?

116
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:33,944
I have not earned a damn thing for two years.

117
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:39,224
--Do you understand the transport center ...
--It will not happen.

118
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:44,904
Yes, it does.
When we win, it's ours and yours.

119
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,824
--I do everything for you.
And going against Fabbretti?

120
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:55,384
We are all against. If we win,
we will have it all to ourselves.

121
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:04,864
No, you will not be enough.

122
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:10,744
<i> Hug him! Hug the idiot. To here </ i>

123
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:34,264
I was bitten by a dog. Watch.

124
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,904
I have disinfected it.

125
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:43,384
Put a little iodine.
It does not look infected out.

126
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:46,944
Yes?

127
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:53,224
--You also set up to the election.
--Yes.

128
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:56,424
I support Michele Casillo.

129
00:15:56,504 --> 00:16:01,464
Last you got 7,000 preference votes
Those I could use.

130
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:06,664
I have served the municipality for ten years,
but not on your side.

131
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:10,544
the lists are
not published yet.

132
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:16,984
--There is always a place for you.
--You are wasting your time.

133
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:24,104
You're a good person.
I am not here to make friends.

134
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:29,984
We must stand together against all those
which is destroying our city.

135
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:35,504
We can not make alliances.
--What alliances?

136
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:45,144
Is there still
alliances today?

137
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:54,024
I must be honest. I know
who you are and where you belong.

138
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:12,744
If the wound was deeper, would
have reached the ulna and radius.

139
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:21,784
I am not a trained doctor.

140
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:28,344
But I know a few things.

141
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:33,264
There is room for you
bottom of my list. Do you understand?

142
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,664
Good job.

143
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:53,184
They all do it ...

144
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:58,224
Hey.
Hey.

145
00:17:58,304 --> 00:18:01,704
--Is your name Gessica.
--How do you know?

146
00:18:01,784 --> 00:18:05,464
A mutual acquaintance. I am Genny.

147
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,944
--Are you from Giugliano?
--No.

148
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:12,144
--What do you want?
--Say that you are beautiful.

149
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,664
--Get out.
--Wait.

150
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:17,864
--Are you here tomorrow?
Why?

151
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:22,184
I'm coming,
maybe we can go for a ride.

152
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:26,744
--We shall see. Hey.
Hey.

153
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:32,104
Trak, you will have smoke or pot?

154
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:35,904
--Can I see?
Pot is best.

155
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:42,384
What are you smoking?
Is that marijuana?

156
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:45,624
You can not believe a damn thing.

157
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:49,664
--Have you made ??money?
Can you reach the ground?

158
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:52,944
Beautiful motorcycle.

159
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:56,264
Who belongs to it?
--Ciro.

160
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:00,144
By Ciro, you run around
on his motorcycle?

161
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:05,304
I made the spark.
Now try I run it.

162
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:10,064
--Get off.
No, stop now.

163
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:13,024
Shut up.

164
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:16,784
You stay here. Now it is our.

165
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,664
You stay here.

166
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:34,904
Be a good boy.

167
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:39,224
Stay there and shut up.

168
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:49,984
It ends wrong.

169
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:14,384
--Hello.
--Hello.

170
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:18,744
I have signatures with.

171
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:23,304
--500 Signatures?
--850 As a precaution.

172
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:26,464
Let me go.

173
00:20:26,544 --> 00:20:31,224
What are you doing you idiot?
--Stay away.

174
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:35,664
--Do you have your own list?
--Stay away from me.

175
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:39,264
I'll get at you.

176
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:56,224
Genna,
Fabbretti took the signatures.

177
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:13,224
Must I do everything myself?

178
00:21:49,344 --> 00:21:54,384
What's going on?
You must make an appointment.

179
00:21:54,464 --> 00:22:00,344
--Gennaro Savastano. Give me the list.
Yes, I support Casillo.

180
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:04,544
--Can I talk to Mom?
--You talking to me.

181
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:11,664
It's a miracle that your friend
sitting in council.

182
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:15,064
Get out now.

183
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:22,144
Give me the signatures.
--What are you doing?

184
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:25,344
What's it gonna be?

185
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:49,944
The crashed.

186
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:53,104
Drove wrong?

187
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,584
How did it happen?

188
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:04,184
That's my fault. I was out yesterday.
I'm doing it. Give me two days.

189
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:12,744
You're funny. Capaebomba
told what happened.

190
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,904
"It crashed."

191
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:32,024
I am looking for someone I can trust.

192
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:35,344
One who is skilled.

193
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:39,624
I need a courier.

194
00:23:40,664 --> 00:23:45,584
You can drive around town
in goods.

195
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:52,144
If you do it well ...
Like the motorcycle?

196
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:54,864
Then you get it.

197
00:23:57,024 --> 00:24:00,304
What do you say?

198
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:03,584
--Do you want it?
--Yes.

199
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:11,104
--Can I trust you?
--Yes, you can.

200
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:19,384
--I have to go now. Hey.
--See you.

201
00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:33,864
--I have to go.
--Wait ...

202
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:45,664
--Gessica.
--I have to go now.

203
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:54,424
Good night.

204
00:24:56,984 --> 00:25:00,904
--Kl. is 1
--I know, Dad ...

205
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:05,784
Do not be hard on her, doctor.
It's our first date.

206
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:09,944
It was my fault. Good night.

207
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:08,824
Hey, Gennaro.
--Good evening.

208
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:15,784
Why do you mess with that?
Is not it better to Fabbretti?

209
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:22,904
--Has the mayor done something wrong?
--Michele Casillo is younger, more.

210
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:27,624
I am secretary
Ministry of Transport.

211
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:32,024
We will transport center
because of me.

212
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:36,264
If you need anything,
then come to me.

213
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:41,504
You do not need Mayor Square
to get what you want.

214
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:47,784
Are you saying you do me a favor?

215
00:26:48,264 --> 00:26:51,904
You have Dad to thank for your job.

216
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:55,344
Does your father know what you're doing?

217
00:26:55,424 --> 00:27:01,384
Father sitting in isolation.
Now it's me who decides.

218
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:06,944
Listen. I do not care
with Giuglianos Mayor space.

219
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:11,024
People have asked me,
to get you to reconsider.

220
00:27:11,104 --> 00:27:16,104
You get people against you, which has
worked side by side with your father.

221
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:19,584
Reliable people who like you.

222
00:27:19,664 --> 00:27:23,864
I understand that.
You are young and want to change things.

223
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:26,624
You ...

224
00:27:26,704 --> 00:27:32,344
I should shoot you in the mouth,
because you're wasting my time.

225
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:35,344
Do you understand that?

226
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:19,184
What is it?

227
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:24,704
--Nothing.
--Sure?

228
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:48,104
--I'll call you later.
--Do you?

229
00:29:57,824 --> 00:30:01,104
I have to go. Hey.

230
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:08,184
Hello, doctor.

231
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:14,784
What are you doing? What do you want me?

232
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:21,544
I do not know what people are saying about
my family, but they are envious.

233
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:28,304
I actually like Gessica.
All I can say.

234
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:31,184
Have a nice day.

235
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:57,904
If a customer will patronize me
he must walk 500 meters.

236
00:30:57,984 --> 00:31:04,464
--So he is acting in the supermarket.
--I know you have lost many customers.

237
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:08,624
Excuse me.

238
00:31:17,264 --> 00:31:21,024
Shop--owners are with us.
It's not enough.

239
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:25,664
What do you mean?
We have assembled with us.

240
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:30,424
St. Stephen's association is with us.
Tomorrow I'm talking to the sports hall.

241
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:36,384
Fabbretti got 64% of votes. We must
have them. Even those on the left.

242
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:42,984
--Left? That's 24 votes?
--It's not funny.

243
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:46,504
If we lose, it's all over.

244
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:49,984
--I do my best.
It's not enough.

245
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:55,624
--You go from door to door, you hear?
--Yes.

246
00:31:55,944 --> 00:32:00,984
--Come on.
-- "Come on."

247
00:32:38,704 --> 00:32:43,064
I hold an election dinner
with important people.

248
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:47,224
--Do you see instead?
--I do not want anything from you.

249
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:52,624
--You have done enough damage.
What do you mean?

250
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:56,104
What the hell have I done to you?

251
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:59,704
You do not know?
Then I will tell it.

252
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:06,304
In Honduras, I sat in a cabin with
an American who chattered away.

253
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:11,024
Your money did not come.
One evening I got a machete.

254
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:14,464
They shouted, "Kill him."

255
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:20,744
I prayed that you would rescue
me. But no one came.

256
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:26,464
They screamed:
"Kill him, otherwise we will kill you."

257
00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:30,344
So I did it.
I chopped off his head.

258
00:33:30,424 --> 00:33:34,224
Then his arm, then his hand.

259
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:39,304
I chopped him to pieces.
Do you understand now?

260
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:47,304
Otherwise, you just continue
together with Ciro.

261
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:52,264
I sent you there
for you to learn something.

262
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:58,824
It seems that it worked.
Am I right?

263
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:32,104
2,000. Maybe.
That's what I can do.

264
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:36,984
I do not understand. Explain.

265
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:41,984
I do not do. I try
to give you my vote--

266
00:34:42,064 --> 00:34:47,944
--if possible. But promise me
to stop seeing my daughter.

267
00:34:48,024 --> 00:34:53,384
--You really do not like me, huh?
--I have no opinion about you.

268
00:34:53,464 --> 00:34:58,144
It's my offer.
Do you accept it or not?

269
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:07,904
And then they call us bad people.
--Tomorrow I'll call the patients.

270
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:11,864
Remove your hand from the throat.

271
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:19,144
Talk to you,
when the polling stations closed.

272
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:21,824
Smut.

273
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:59,664
There he is. Hurry.

274
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:08,104
Are you choice the President?

275
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:10,944
--Hello.
--Listen.

276
00:36:11,024 --> 00:36:16,824
First election night Leaning out of
toilet window and receive a blank tag.

277
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:19,104
Hallo.

278
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:23,304
Turn him.

279
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:27,984
Did you understand what my friend said?
Did you know?

280
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:34,664
--Let's move out, Capaebomba.
--Did he get it?

281
00:36:35,064 --> 00:36:38,144
Go, go.

282
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:48,624
--Champagne?
--Yes.

283
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:53,144
Sorry, I'll talk
with the other guests.

284
00:36:55,224 --> 00:36:58,184
Gennaro.

285
00:36:58,264 --> 00:37:03,224
The brothers Maturano.
They know all.

286
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:07,624
If you want, I can go there.

287
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:12,824
No, why? Come on.

288
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:34,184
Good. Back to work.

289
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:53,624
I lead in the polls.

290
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:56,984
Thanks, I disappoint them. Hey.

291
00:38:57,064 --> 00:39:00,864
Candidates must not be
polling station.

292
00:39:00,944 --> 00:39:04,624
--We must suppose though.
--Go now.

293
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,384
--Why are you doing such a fuss?
--You should not be here.

294
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:13,704
Go now.

295
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:21,744
I understand your plan now.
You were right.

296
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:27,864
You show that you can handle it yourself.
They will respect you.

297
00:39:27,944 --> 00:39:32,304
But remember that I am your best friend.

298
00:39:32,384 --> 00:39:37,624
I'm always on your side
also if you lose.

299
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:46,664
I do not lose. Do you understand that?

300
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:20,584
Hurry.

301
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:37,384
Good day.

302
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,784
--Number two.
Thank you.

303
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:20,144
Now.

304
00:41:25,104 --> 00:41:27,424
Go now.

305
00:41:30,144 --> 00:41:35,704
<i> These are the first measurements
from the municipality Giugliano. </ i>

306
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:40,064
<i> It is a constituency
with a clear result. </ i>

307
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:43,904
<i> It is
a surprising victory Casillo </ i>

<i> We proceed to
the other municipalities ... </ i>

310

<i> Hey, Mayor.
