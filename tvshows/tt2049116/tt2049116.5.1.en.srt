2
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,800
Don't move!

3
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,360
They're looking for you all over,

4
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
but your hideout's safe.

5
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,520
It's not a hideout,

6
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,920
it's a prison.

7
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,160
And I locked myself in here
all on my own.

8
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,640
If they haven't found me yet
it's only thanks to you, Mistral.

9
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,760
I had a bad dream:

10
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,200
hands, arms were reaching
outta the ground,

11
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,520
they were grabbing at me
and I couldn't get free.

12
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,760
The dead were returning.

13
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,440
They were dragging me
underground with them.

14
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,720
The dead don't return even in dreams.

15
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
It's the living we gotta be scared of.

16
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,720
Mrs Levante...

17
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
Please, follow me.

18
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,840
You confirm that you have no idea
who it could have been?

19
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,280
Think carefully.

20
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,320
Any news about
my brother Michelangelo?

21
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,760
The police haven't found
any trace of him.

22
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,920
We fear he and his wife
have ended up like your parents.

23
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,480
Have faith in the justice system.

24
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,840
My brother doesn't even have
a grave to put a flower on.

25
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,040
You can't deny us the comfort
of a grave for Mamma and Papa.

26
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,000
You've kept them locked
in there for ten days.

27
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,360
When can we give them a decent burial?

28
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,680
It's not possible in Naples,
you know that.

29
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,360
We just want to bury them in peace.

30
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,600
Put an end to it.

31
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,080
The only vengeance is justice.

32
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,720
Justice is in the hands of God
and we've always trusted him.

33
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,840
Did you behave?

34
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,000
I did what the women in our family
know how to do best,

35
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,840
mouth shut, eyes down.

36
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,320
Good, it won't be the cops
that make Gennaro pay.

37
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,360
We gotta get vengeance for our own blood.

38
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,720
The magistrate's authorized
the funeral.

39
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,400
It's not gonna be in Naples, but in Rome.

40
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,960
And we know where.

41
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,360
Good, so we can bury them
with their mother and father.

42
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,720
Don Gennaro, leave it to us.

43
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,040
If they find you it's over
and we can't afford that.

44
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,640
But we gotta move fast.

45
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,240
We got people in Rome who can help us.

46
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,880
When the time comes, we'll be ready.

47
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,480
There's something else.

48
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,080
Our guy in the DA's office said

49
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,400
they don't know anything
about Patrizia's accusations.

50
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,680
Good evening, counselor.

51
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,840
It's been a while, Don Gennaro.

52
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,080
What's with the formality?
We used to be close.

53
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,920
Things change,
you're not a kid anymore.

54
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,160
You were at my father's side
for 30 years, with loyalty and respect.

55
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,080
You're part of the family.

56
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,680
When Don Pietro died
I thought it was all over,

57
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,200
instead it's like he's standing
in front of me again.

58
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I need to know what I'm accused of.

59
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,520
The magistrate's a hardass,

60
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,880
he's sealed the files,
but I'm working on it.

61
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,320
We gotta move fast.

62
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,520
Trust me, Gennaro.

63
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,760
She's beautiful.

64
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,000
You can tell she's got our blood.

65
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,440
If Mamma was still here
she'd be proud of you.

66
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,440
May she live to a hundred!

67
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
A hundred years, kiddo!

68
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,480
Come here.

69
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,120
Come to Uncle.

70
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,320
Lavinia, every kid you have comes out
better than the one before.

71
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,760
- You better hold her.
- Come to Papa.

72
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,560
You're right, Don Angelo,
but don't say that to Serena.

73
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,840
She's very jealous.

74
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,000
And whaddaya got
to be jealous of, Serena?

75
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
Don Angelo sure loves kids.

76
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,480
C'mon! Don't you want
to give him a baby?

77
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,560
Still on about that, Lavinia?
It's not for us.

78
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
You don't listen,

79
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,480
but if you give him a son
you'll make him the happiest man alive.

80
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,160
He's the happiest man alive
because he knows I love him,

81
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,800
so much so that I don't want
to share him with anyone.

82
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,560
You open your legs and babies come out.

83
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,120
I keep my husband's face in there.

84
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,200
If that's what you like...

85
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,080
- You spoken to the guys in Rome?
- It seems it's all under control.

86
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,080
There won't be any problems.

87
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,160
There'll only be a police escort
for the hearse, people at the cemetery...

88
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,600
It's not that simple, Luciana.

89
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,560
You gotta do what you gotta do.

90
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,800
What's wrong?

91
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,480
He's the boss and he knows we're nobody.

92
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,000
That's why you gotta go by yourself.

93
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,160
He'll know he can trust you
and that he needs us.

94
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,480
Let's go.

95
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,720
Fernando's taking you.

96
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,160
Is it your will that Lucrezia Maria
Immacolata be baptized

97
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,880
in the faith of the Church
we all profess?

98
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
Yes, it is.

99
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,520
Lucrezia Maria Immacolata, I baptize you

100
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,840
in the name of the Father, of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

101
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,280
Parents and godparents,
this light is entrusted to you

102
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,000
to be kept burning brightly.

103
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,440
May your child, enlightened by Christ,

104
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,880
walk always as a child of the light,

105
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,560
and keeping the flame of faith alive

106
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,320
may she go to meet the Lord
with all the saints,

107
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,400
in the heavenly kingdom.

108
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,400
Come on, sweetie.

109
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,400
Sweetie, what ride do you want to go on?

110
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,080
What's wrong, Pietro?

111
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
When's Papa coming back?

112
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,920
Sweetheart, Papa's not coming back.

113
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,760
He's never coming back.

114
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,480
Let's go.

115
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,800
- All good, bro?
- Yeah.

116
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,760
Trust me.

117
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,560
VERANO CEMETERY

118
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,120
The cops are locking you in!

119
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,080
They fucked us!
The cops are here, run!

120
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,480
Close it!

121
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,760
The exit's that way.

122
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,960
We're close.

123
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,200
The Levante family tomb is here, lot 329.

124
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,040
I checked carefully, the ceremony
in church was booked for them,

125
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,000
Gerlando and Benedetta Levante.

126
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,600
Maybe it's like you say
but you shoulda checked better.

127
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,920
When it's so important,

128
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,520
an innocent mistake
becomes an unforgivable betrayal.

129
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,560
Please...

130
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,520
PRIMA PORTA CEMETERY

131
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,840
Keep your eyes peeled.

132
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,760
There was piranhas waiting at Verano.

133
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,080
There was cops too.

134
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,880
That's why the magistrate
had them buried here.

135
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,920
Because of him they've been laid
to rest in no-man's land.

136
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,640
And Gennaro's still free.

137
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,320
We gotta take care
of Gennaro Savastano.

138
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
We gotta bury him
under shit tons of dirt.

139
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,400
I got a message for Mistral.

140
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,000
Please, have a seat.

141
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,320
Sorry to disturb you at this hour.

142
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,480
If you're here in the middle
of the night, it's urgent.

143
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,320
I know you want to talk to my husband,

144
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,840
but he was godfather
at my niece's baptism today.

145
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,800
He drank too much at the reception,
excuse him, he's not well.

146
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,840
- He's resting.
- Sorry to hear it.

147
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,600
You can tell me
whatever you have to say to him.

148
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm speaking on behalf of Don Aniello.

149
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,160
I'm happy to listen.

150
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,040
They say whatever is said to you
goes straight to Gennaro Savastano.

151
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,840
They have an overactive imagination.

152
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,800
But if they were right,
what would they want to say to him?

153
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,880
My uncle sees what the Levantes
are doing in Secondigliano

154
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,960
and he heard what happened
at the cemetery in Rome.

155
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,760
Know what he thinks?

156
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,080
Whoever's left of the Levantes

157
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,960
should go join their family.

158
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,680
Good evening.

159
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,200
It was a trap, that shithead magistrate
was waiting for us.

160
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,040
- The Levantes weren't there.
- The fuck you saying, Mistral?

161
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,280
They made us look like idiots?
Are you an idiot?

162
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,080
You an idiot?

163
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,440
If you are, you better tell me now.

164
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,080
My father said only fools
give second chances.

165
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,080
Lucky for you I'm not my father,
but I'm not a fool either.

166
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,600
Ambition's important, you need me
to get outta this shithole.

167
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,400
I understand you.

168
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,640
But you gotta do things right.

169
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,880
Or I won't let you out of here.

170
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,800
Don't worry, Donna Luciana,
your husband's as fit as a fiddle.

171
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,280
But the heads of the Levantes
he promised me...

172
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,840
I got a message for you.

173
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,520
What's wrong, you don't like me?

174
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,400
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks, Don Aniello.

175
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,440
Don Gennaro's happy to meet you.

176
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,480
But given the situation
he needs a safe place.

177
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,880
Of course, this isn't
a great time for our Gennaro.

178
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,680
He needs to be real careful.

179
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Does he know how
lucky he is to have you?

180
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,520
Can I ask you something?

181
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,560
Why are you with him?

182
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,720
Obviously Gennaro
promised him something.

183
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,400
What can he promise?
He's got nothing left.

184
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,400
But whoever wins the war takes all.

185
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,760
Picking an ally is fundamental.

186
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,520
And that's why
we're here with Don Angelo.

187
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,320
Isn't it?

188
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,640
Every alliance has a price.

189
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,560
Tell me what to say to Gennaro.

190
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,200
That we have the perfect place
for the occasion.

191
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,800
It's on for tonight.

192
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,160
Good evening, Don Angelo,
the car's ready.

193
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,560
It's all good.

194
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,480
Good job.

195
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,360
Good night.

196
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,080
You know what you gotta do.

197
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,960
This is the car I prepared for you.

198
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,760
- We can't afford any mistakes.
- Trust me.

199
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,720
We got Gennaro Savastano off our ass!

200
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,240
Run!

201
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,760
Go!

202
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,360
Your uncle was right, Graduate.

203
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,680
The most important thing
is to choose your allies well.

204
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,400
You disgust me.

205
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,760
Fair enough.

206
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,520
Don Elia, everything okay?

207
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,640
Here, Don Aniello, I got a gift for you.

208
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,280
I wanted you
to say goodbye to your nephew.

209
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,960
You're not worth shit.

210
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,920
Your father knew it and you know it too.

211
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,520
If that was true,
you'd be holding this

212
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,120
and your nephew would still be alive.

213
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,240
You can't kill me

214
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,520
because I know something that's worth
more than your pent-up anger.

215
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,440
Chitchat won't get rid of my anger.

216
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,080
Ciro Di Marzio is alive.

217
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,640
You're making things worse.

218
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,920
I saved him.

219
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,440
I helped him that night.

220
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
He's left Naples.

221
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,240
That so?

222
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Only I know where he is.

223
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,600
if you want me to tell you,

224
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,840
you gotta man up.

225
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
Lower the gun

226
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,880
and give me your word
that between you and me it ends here.

227
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,880
Where is he?

228
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,040
Far away.

229
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,240
He's in Riga.

230
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,600
He left you alone
with the remorse you killed him.

231
00:43:39,305 --> 00:44:39,403
