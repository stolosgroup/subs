1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:27,090
She has added a photo me and mom on "book".

3
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:31,051
- Facebook, a social network.
- I am worried.

4
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:34,180
It should not be.
All young people have it.

5
00:00:34,263 --> 00:00:38,770
It is a waste of time.
What in the world she writes?

6
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:43,441
- She writes what suits her.
- Can anyone see it?

7
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:46,735
All her friends.

8
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:52,157
So I throw the computer out, so she'll stop.

9
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:29,403
This is good.

10
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:52,009
- It's too modern.
- You're so old-fashioned, Attilio.

11
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:55,929
What did I say?
It's too modern for me.

12
00:01:58,348 --> 00:02:00,976
I think it's gonna end badly.

13
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:04,353
Don Pietro could talk to Conte.

14
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:15,199
Do not like it?

15
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:16,094
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- It's me, Mom.

16
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,871
Go.

17
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:51,295
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, he's headed there.

18
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:39,050
Salvato, do not smoke at the table.

19
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:44,015
It is a false cigarette.
Can not you see the light?

20
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:46,393
I try to keep up.

21
00:04:46,476 --> 00:04:50,479
It makes no difference that it is false.

22
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:53,858
I do not want you smoke at the table.

23
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:05,827
Lord, bless us and the daily
bread, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

24
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,037
Amen.

25
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:44,659
Mom, you should be with a cooking program.

26
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,292
Turn on.

27
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:08,556
What is it?

28
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:16,400
- What happened?
- Nothing. Relax. Wait.

29
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:19,319
The pigs have set fire to the place.
Come here.

30
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:23,739
- Salvatore...
- Calm down.

31
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:28,160
Do not worry.

32
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:32,790
- Do not worry.
- Where are we going?

33
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,376
You mild.

34
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:43,343
- We are dying now, Salvatore.
- Sit here.

35
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:51,017
Full of grace, the Lord is with you.

36
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,437
Blessed are you
among women and the fruit of your womb.

37
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,190
Hello? I want to report a fire.

38
00:06:58,274 --> 00:07:01,777
It burns in with Stornaiolo 71

39
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:05,780
No, I do not know.
You can see the fire from the street.

40
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:11,244
No, I'm not.
I am a citizen. Anyone.

41
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:23,341
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

42
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:27,261
- Now and in our hour of death.

43
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:34,936
It stinks of gasoline.
What's the deal?

44
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,646
- The leaking well.
- Idiot.

45
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,690
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

46
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:47,282
You bet 1,000 on pupetta?
So we win 5,000.

47
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:53,204
- Go to hell, Alfre.
- We can win 6,000, Atti.

48
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:57,959
- 6,000.
- Shut up.

49
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:03,714
Use them wisely.
I can not play my money up.

50
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:08,593
- Then you need to keep them.
- Go to hell.

51
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:12,764
My clothes stink. I'm going home
and change. Do you want to?

52
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:14,852
Let's go.

53
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:18,522
- See you.
- Hello.

54
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:32,530
- Hello. Go ahead, come in..
- Thank you, Donna Imma.

55
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:37,410
- Coffee?
- We will not interfere.

56
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:40,412
- I do not interfere.
- Thank you.

57
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:44,083
<i>- Carmela. Brew coffee.</i>
- Okay.

58
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:52,134
What are you doing?

59
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,181
Looking at her ass?

60
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:01,059
- Not at all.
- Shame on you.

61
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:07,774
Curcio writes 1.78
and De Rosa writes 1.2490.

62
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:12,319
Don Pietro, is it safe?

63
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:17,243
I do, but if Contes company is, we're done.

64
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:22,331
I was out twice
and will not shafted by Conte again.

65
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,873
I understand that.

66
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:28,169
Firstly:
Speak well, there are ladies present.

67
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:29,754
Sorry, Donna Imma.

68
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:34,217
Second: Conte has grasped
he will not blunder.

69
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:37,053
Can we be sure of that?

70
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:44,518
Do as surveyor says then the contract home.

71
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:46,689
Gennaro.

72
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:53,821
Appendix 2 Russo, coefficient 14

73
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:59,492
I would like to have been there
and see the bastard fucking pants.

74
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:03,997
- He must remain in the skin.
- And fit Hהschen.

75
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,292
And if he does not get it?

76
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:20,348
So we explain to him again that it is
Salvatore Conte's rules, not mine.

77
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:35,362
- Donna Imma, excuse me.
- Ciro.

78
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:39,199
I would hear Don Pietro if I can go.

79
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:42,535
- It's all right. I say it.
- Good evening.

80
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:46,831
Listen, Ciro.
Like this couch?

81
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,546
Jeez. It is very nice.

82
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:55,424
Then you get it off me.

83
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:59,970
- Do you think about it?
- I can not accept it.

84
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:05,016
You do me a favor.
I get a new bed in the morning.

85
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,478
I ask Genny help you. Genny.

86
00:13:08,562 --> 00:13:11,647
<i>- What is it, Mom?</i>
- Come and Ciro.

87
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:16,694
Here.

88
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:21,117
- Thank you, Gennaro.
- You, Ciro?

89
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:27,998
Call me next time grilling with Conte.

90
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:33,003
Do not worry, you'll get the opportunity.
It's not over.

91
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:37,257
Call me. Do you understand?

92
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:40,635
Hey.

93
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:43,304
- Thank you.
- Hello.

94
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:06,954
Is it safe? I understand. Thank you.

95
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:09,998
- Have Ciro taken couch?
- Yes, why?

96
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,960
The new one is not good.

97
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:18,005
It is not good. Not good.

98
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:21,511
The family Capano has been
Sharm el-Sheikh.

99
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,723
- Who wants to hear about Capano?
- Where are you grumpy.

100
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:29,643
- I've been eating too many meatballs.
- He has only eaten fifteen.

101
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:32,020
He probably tapeworms.

102
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:37,359
- The kids would love Sharm el-Sheikh.
- They have fun anywhere.

103
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:41,571
- But there's more fun there.
- You're so beautiful.

104
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:49,998
It is late. Attilio!

105
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:57,254
- Atti, we need to go.
- I can not take.

106
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:00,883
I'll even go so.

107
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,218
I'll call you.

108
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,221
- Hey, Antonietta.
- Hello.

109
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,531
- Hey, toupee.
- Ciro.

110
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:25,742
Ciruzzo. A coffee?

111
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:29,536
Ciro? Do I have with you?

112
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,250
- Why do you think I'm here?
- Everything is planned in advance.

113
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:41,382
- Can I ask you a favor?
- What is it toupee?

114
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:45,593
My wife has a nephew He's good, but...

115
00:17:56,685 --> 00:18:02,023
Three dead. At least three dead.
And who are injured on the floor.

116
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:05,151
The bastards also threw two bombs.

117
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:10,865
- How are you?
- Never mind. You should have been dead.

118
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:16,036
We fucked up, Atti. I knew
Conte would avenge the fire.

119
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,582
Do not tell Pietro.
Do you understand that?

120
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:30,384
It could have been any of us,
other than the immortal-

121
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:33,804
- Him that no one can kill.

122
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:39,769
Anyone of the Center. So would
we have arranged over one of ours.

123
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:46,858
They shot at our house on a Sunday.
There could have been children.

124
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:51,446
It is not something To remedy.

125
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:54,326
We have to find him.

126
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:59,122
And pulling his snake tongue.

127
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:03,292
They say he's hiding in hats factory.

128
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,796
No matter where he is, we'll find him.

129
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,050
Yes, Don Piט, but we must start somewhere.

130
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:14,303
We need to get him out.
It is not a place...

131
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,306
- Not this place?
- We can not just walk into.

132
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,143
- It's dangerous.
- I need to be more clear.

133
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,775
We must think.
He guards everywhere.

134
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:29,778
What are we thinking?

135
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:34,699
If it was your son at the bar,
You should also think about first?

136
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:37,785
And you should also think?

137
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,913
- And you?
- Yes, but what do we do?

138
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:43,624
Shut up.

139
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:51,757
Conte should have thought of it before.
Now it's too late.

140
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,262
How do we get in?
There are guards everywhere.

141
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:43,267
It is his territory. What do you say?

142
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:47,396
I do not know if we find Conte,
or if he finds us.

143
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,942
- We have found him.
- I'm serious.

144
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,911
Salvatore Conte does what he wants,
and Don Pietro obey him.

145
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:06,583
He is not Pietro Savastano
for its blue eyes sake.

146
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,342
You know what I think?

147
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:22,055
Pietro Savastano has grown old,
and by Salvatore Conte.

148
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,233
<i>Police technicians</i>
examine the blasting sites.

149
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:36,529
Should we not buy that new couch
outside Naples? In Salerno.

150
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:39,407
- What do you say?
- No.

151
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,578
Should we buy the same
when we know that it is full of...

152
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:46,748
We should not do anything.

153
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,253
Should we hang warning signs up?

154
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:59,303
I should have given them
an upside down and smashed shop.

155
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:02,055
I think they knew something.

156
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:05,350
- Speak well.
- Am I speaking Chinese?

157
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:10,021
- We should not do anything.
- Shall we sit on the floor?

158
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:39,217
Go ahead. Go to your father.

159
00:22:56,402 --> 00:23:00,239
- Clear path.
- Clear path.

160
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:04,242
There are clear.

161
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:59,048
- Hello.
- Hello.

162
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:18,275
Hurry up.

163
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:21,443
- Do you remember it?
- Yes.

164
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:28,202
They have started a new organization.
Do you know?

165
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:33,374
There are guards and journalists.
They have sold 300 fewer doses.

166
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,960
- Did you talk to Pietro?
- They are waiting for us.

167
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:57,231
There's nothing to do.

168
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:04,488
I've tried, but he does not listen.
It must be done now.

169
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:07,908
We are making his life a living hell.
As he did with us.

170
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:12,913
Good. So we get the police
and the press after us again.

171
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:15,040
Where is he hiding?

172
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:18,752
He is there, where Hהschen saved tomorrow.

173
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:22,963
- Says who?
- I do not know. He just know.

174
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,132
He's crazy.

175
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:29,347
He says Conte spreading rumors
that Savastano is at risk.

176
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,266
- That's what I said.
- Stop.

177
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:37,104
We must do what is necessary.
Man for himself.

178
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:39,898
Now we go.

179
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:55,371
When you stop to slander Pietro?

180
00:25:55,454 --> 00:26:01,921
If they gossip,
you get a bullet in your head.

181
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:07,009
Imagine if it was me, that would shoot you?

182
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:21,439
Pino, I have no money.
Can I borrow some of yours?

183
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:26,485
- Forget it.
- Come on. You get them during the week.

184
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:30,658
What is it?
Are your feet are made of confections?

185
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:37,581
Can I ask you something?
Is that marzipan confections?

186
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:45,756
Because I have weird shoes on?
Idiots.

187
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,176
I ask Genny about money.

188
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:53,387
- What are you? He's on another line now.
- What is he doing?

189
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,603
Please come here, confections.
Give a hand to the confection.

190
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:03,358
Did you know that the
have lowered prices in Sanitא?

191
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:06,693
Now it costs heroin Eleven.

192
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:11,949
They say this is due to a new organization.

193
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:17,371
But I do not think.

194
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:21,916
- Why so?
- The disposes of it.

195
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:25,628
They know that soon hernia.
So there will be guards-

196
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:30,301
- And with guards nearby,
you can not sell anything.

197
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:37,474
Is it tomorrow?

198
00:27:41,478 --> 00:27:44,565
- I will.
- It does not, Gennaro.

199
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:48,360
- Determines you over me?
- No.

200
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:51,529
It is your father who decide.

201
00:27:55,742 --> 00:28:00,790
I want to show Dad, I can handle it.

202
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:05,712
- If you are with, I can do it.
- I know you can.

203
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:09,173
But it's still dangerous.

204
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,262
Want to make your father happy?

205
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:18,682
So stay home.

206
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:30,111
Are you scared?

207
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:35,784
Do you think it's strange?

208
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:43,666
If Dad lets me take, so I protect you.

209
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:49,797
That's right.

210
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:04,581
Make a to receipt to Attilio Diotallevi.

211
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,878
- Is that a problem?
- No.

212
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:14,799
- Should he also have three stores?
- Yes.

213
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:21,973
A receipt for Attilio
and two to Centocapelli and A 'Lisca.

214
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:33,694
- Hit it.
- Here.

215
00:31:04,683 --> 00:31:07,311
- Hello.
- Hello.

216
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:16,277
- When will you?
- Soon.

217
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:27,537
Close the door slightly.

218
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:03,992
- Where's the coffee?
- On the other hand.

219
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:19,841
Where are you stupid.

220
00:32:28,557 --> 00:32:32,394
Father?
Can I take with Ciro tonight?

221
00:32:35,774 --> 00:32:39,528
- Dad?
- I heard you. The answer is no.

222
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:43,740
- I'll stick with him.
- There is no reason for it.

223
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:47,952
Go out and have fun.
Your time will come.

224
00:32:49,871 --> 00:32:52,832
You make me never have a chance.

225
00:32:52,915 --> 00:32:57,961
Gennaro, you are my son.
You need no chances.

226
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,753
- Look straight ahead.
- I will die with combed hair.

227
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:42,048
We buy his jacket
in children's clothing store next time.

228
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:45,301
- Did you hear?
- Go to hell.

229
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,228
- You all right, Michele?
- Fine, and you?

230
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:39,065
It's going well. Hey.

231
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,693
Lucia. She is an expert in billiards.

232
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:49,032
- I do not shake your hand.
- She does not vibrate. Get it?

233
00:34:49,115 --> 00:34:53,244
Do you ever laugh a little?
You are always so angry.

234
00:34:53,328 --> 00:34:57,247
You are right. I'm mad.

235
00:35:10,096 --> 00:35:13,056
- What are you doing?
- Would you like something to drink?

236
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:16,101
- She's with me.
- Your name would Noemi?

237
00:35:16,184 --> 00:35:19,312
Fatter not you? Are you stupid or what?

238
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:23,775
- What did you say?
- Gennaro, stop.

239
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:28,445
- I'll kill you.
- We are in their territory.

240
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,157
Hello, Noemi.

241
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:09,030
Put it on, immortal,
then you can be more calm.

242
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,006
It's going to go to hell.

243
00:37:47,753 --> 00:37:49,421
Pis.

244
00:41:13,293 --> 00:41:15,629
Attilio!

245
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:21,634
Attilio. Attilio.

246
00:41:36,272 --> 00:41:39,653
- It hurts.
- It'll be fine.

247
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:44,783
- It'll be fine.
- It hurts.

248
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:51,455
Atti.

249
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:58,587
Atti.

250
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:16,940
We must get away. The police come.
We go. He's dead.

251
00:42:17,024 --> 00:42:21,569
We can not do anything.
Would you be caught? Come on.

252
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:29,405
What happens to you?
Why are you acting like this?

253
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:34,451
I thought that it was better
to tell everything at once.

254
00:44:36,745 --> 00:44:39,331
Tell.

255
00:44:41,877 --> 00:44:46,757
Attilio's death. Centocapelli with.
And A 'and Lisca Africano.

256
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,301
And skimmings?

257
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:52,220
He fled when he was there.

258
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:55,264
He was there. He was there.

259
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:59,435
But all your men are dead.
There's no one left.

260
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,278
It was probably for the best.

261
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,616
It comes Conte to remember.

262
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,537
Now he thinks about, before he slips up.

263
00:45:28,548 --> 00:45:31,718
I'm sorry, happened to Attilio.

264
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:36,221
I know that he was like a father to you.

265
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:39,808
You know also, That we may do it?

266
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:42,855
And it must be like this?

267
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:51,196
I make a funeral wreath for all.

268
00:45:51,279 --> 00:45:54,782
I'll take care of women and wives.

269
00:45:54,866 --> 00:46:01,498
I'll fix it. They get money every
month also their girlfriends.

270
00:46:03,124 --> 00:46:06,460
Bravo, immortal.

271
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:09,505
You also get some money.

272
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:48,796
Antonio!
Hurry up, I should be in school.

273
00:46:48,879 --> 00:46:51,214
Your plate.

274
00:46:51,297 --> 00:46:56,136
Antonio! Come on.
Get the cookies in the kitchen.

275
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:17,450
- Luana! Take that.
- In a little while, Mom.

276
00:47:17,533 --> 00:47:20,911
One day it goes to pieces.

277
00:47:20,995 --> 00:47:24,164
Hurry up now.

278
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:36,842
Hello?

279
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,888
<i>Was</i> bloody bodies at the scene.

280
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:45,436
- What do you think?
- Good choice.

281
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,814
It was not very expensive.

282
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:54,861
Is it fine that way?

283
00:47:56,905 --> 00:48:00,825
- Thank you. Goodbye. See you, signora.
- See you.

284
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:15,842
Should we try the wonder?

285
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:21,347
Yes, let's try it.

286
00:48:32,566 --> 00:48:37,195
- Is not that a little harsh?
- It's a little stiff, yes.

287
00:48:41,157 --> 00:48:46,456
Also backrest.
Is it so, or is it faulty?

288
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:49,375
It must be so.

289
00:48:50,585 --> 00:48:55,672
I do not like it.
We need to exchange it.

290
00:48:57,424 --> 00:49:00,844
I should sit comfortably.

291
00:49:03,263 --> 00:49:06,600
We need to exchange it.

292
00:49:25,494 --> 00:49:31,375
Mרgbetjente. You can stop
their microphones diagonally.

293
00:50:13,082 --> 00:50:15,751
Hello, Atti.

294
00:50:56,043 --> 00:50:58,212
- Come on.
- It's too late.

295
00:50:58,295 --> 00:51:01,548
- It is not.

296
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:04,802
Now I watch.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
