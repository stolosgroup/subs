1
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,430
-- the enemy has been defeated

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,724
All around the world

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,476
the enemy falls, crashing to the earth!

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,561
And the greatest miracle of all,

5
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:23,273
is that it was Japan!

6
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,318
Who led the effort to destroy the enemy.

7
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:38,372
We gave her a compass.

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,959
For her birthday…

9
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,420
I think she was…

10
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,880
…she was four.

11
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,091
She loved that compass.

12
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,553
She didn't play with the other toys
for months.

13
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,225
We would take her to the park

14
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,435
and she would take her compass

15
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,400
and line up the little red arrow…

16
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,110
north.

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,905
She would walk that way,
holding the little compass.

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,703
She wanted to know where that…

19
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,206
pull on the needle came from.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,965
It pulled her too.

21
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,684
Breathe. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. Caspar!

22
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,478
It's okay, buddy.

23
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,277
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!

24
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,988
Doctor, check him. Just check him.

25
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,615
-Do your shit.
-What happened?

26
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,200
Keep his heart rate going.

27
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,284
He's breathing.

28
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,244
Careful. Get him in there.

29
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,668
It's gonna be okay.

31
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,266
What's it mean?

32
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,853
What does it mean?

33
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,730
-There's nothing.
-Fuck "nothing." Try it again.

34
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,940
-This is not a test you--
-I said try it again.

35
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,283
-No reactivity.
-Fuck!

36
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,619
He's breathing.

37
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,913
Okay.

38
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,831
-He's breathing. Again.
-Okay.

39
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,459
Come on.

40
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,886
His EEG is flat.

41
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,055
He's not breathing anymore,
the machine is.

42
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,352
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,066
He suffered broad cerebral trauma
from cortex to stem.

44
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,110
His heart stopped,
deoxygenating the brain,

45
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,404
resulting in mass cellular death.

46
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,199
Brain cells are like us.

47
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,078
They die, and they don't ever come back.

48
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,205
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,290
He's lost all of them.

50
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,169
-So…
-He's dead.

51
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,388
Run, Aneesha!

52
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,684
Run, Aneesha! Run!

53
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,369
Did you see where Daddy went?

54
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,084
Your daddy…

55
00:06:58,502 --> 00:06:59,670
They shot him.

56
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,757
He's dead.

57
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,556
Then say it.

58
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,768
No.

59
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,396
He's hiding.

60
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,898
If we wait…

61
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,358
No, sweetheart.

62
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,777
Your daddy…

63
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,947
a bad man took him.

64
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,700
Mom…

65
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,703
tell her.

66
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,413
Tell me what?

67
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,792
Your daddy…

68
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,796
We left him…

69
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,883
and they killed him.

70
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,433
But Mom's here.

71
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,227
I'm here.

72
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,607
Daddy's dead?

73
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,894
-- the enemy has been defeated

74
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,230
All around the world

75
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,773
the enemy falls, crashing to the earth!

76
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,109
They can fight no more,

77
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,735
they die in the street

78
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,863
And the greatest miracle of all,

79
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:35,075
is that it was Japan!

80
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,159
LONG LIVE JAPAN. CELEBRATION.
NEVER GIVE UP!

81
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,328
Our great nation, our great people!

82
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,999
Who led the effort to destroy the enemy.

83
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,208
HOPE, DREAMS, GRATITUDE.

84
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:47,963
Our heroes can hold their heads high

85
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,680
Where you going? Are you running?

86
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,433
Don't you got, like,
family or something, kid?

87
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,144
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Do they know where you are?

88
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,858
You saw what he did.

89
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,694
-No, that wasn't him.
-You saw.

90
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,863
He stopped them.

91
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,157
Nuclear bombs stopped them.
None of this Jedi shit.

92
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,910
-What happened to him? What was it?
-It was a seizure!

93
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:47,995
You saw!

94
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,831
Listen, I saw in there
that he's dead. Okay?

95
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,294
He's still alive. And you're--

96
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,545
I'm not watching.

97
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,338
I've done that.

98
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:01,884
I'm not watching.

99
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:05,888
I held…

100
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,350
I held his hand when they unplugged him.

101
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:14,855
When they did that…

102
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,608
I couldn't save him.

103
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,486
Can't save him.

104
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,156
Okay?

105
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,330
You tried.

106
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,133
You got family here?

107
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,887
My mum works here.

108
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,722
Maybe you should go find her.

109
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,806
I'm fine.

110
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,144
Go on.

111
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,992
Wait.

112
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:21,463
This one's mine.

113
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,926
That's yours.

114
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,763
If you really don't believe that was him…

115
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,432
have a look.

116
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,272
Take it!

117
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,998
Yes!

118
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,673
Hey, soldier! Hey, hey, hey! Fuckin' hero!

119
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,884
Hey, snap a pic with us, would you?

120
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,219
I ain't got a phone.
Will you take a picture?

121
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,305
Got a fucking hero here, innit?

122
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,724
Yeah!

123
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,893
Hey! Let me see. Let me see that.

124
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,061
Okay. Let me see. Let me see.

125
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,230
Yes!

126
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,003
Move away!

127
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,631
Get out of the way!

128
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,160
Oh, yes.

129
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,765
SOC Trevante Cole, Task Force Saxo.

130
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,229
I just wanna get on a plane
back to the US.

131
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,111
Yes, sir.

132
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,576
Okay. Yeah, okay.

133
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,331
Fuck.

134
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,046
We shouldn't have left the road.

135
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,756
I know what we should do.

136
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,886
There's food and soldiers and--

137
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:56,970
People.

138
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,848
People can help us.

139
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,898
Where are we even going?

140
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,526
Mom.

141
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,612
I'm hungry.

142
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:15,781
I'm hungry too, sweetie.

143
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:07,958
There's no one here.

144
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,428
It's too big.

145
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,888
It's warm.

146
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,306
You'll grow.

147
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,900
Scenes are pouring in now
from all around the world.

148
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:36,111
A lot of this we have coming in
over the wire.

149
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,989
A time of celebration and reunion,

150
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,575
people leaving shelter into the open

151
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:45,412
as this alien enemy
has been defeated almost overnight,

152
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:48,081
almost as quickly as they arrived.

153
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:51,543
People now look up at the sky
and they see victory.

154
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,212
That is the word for today.

155
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,172
-And there are celebrations…
-What are we doing?

156
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,174
What are we doing?

157
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,760
-We can go home.
-No, we can't go home.

158
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,304
Yes, we can. Look at everyone.

159
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:04,973
Why are we even here?

160
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:06,266
What are we doing?

161
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:10,437
We're surviving.

162
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,522
Why?

163
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,067
Mommy?

164
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,571
-What's that?
-It's a TV.

165
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,532
What's on it?

166
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:22,616
Nothing.

167
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,453
Are you talking about Daddy?

168
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:30,332
-No, no. We were talking about…
-Surviving.

169
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,877
Mom is telling me
why we're hiding from people.

170
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,505
Why are we hiding?

171
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:42,469
Because sometimes, when everything
seems quiet and nice and safe,

172
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,429
and you feel like you can trust that,

173
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,223
that's when…

174
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,894
You have a voice inside you.

175
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,063
It's always there.

176
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,150
Sometimes it's very, very quiet,
but you have to listen to it.

177
00:21:57,234 --> 00:22:00,237
'Cause that voice in you
is all you can trust.

178
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,407
And my voice is telling me,

179
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,785
"Not yet. Not yet."

180
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:07,995
You understand?

181
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:09,788
Do we live here now?

182
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,499
No, we don't live here.

183
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,710
We can sleep here tonight.

184
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,087
Then where?

185
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:19,423
Nowhere.

186
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,675
Because it isn't safe.

187
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,595
Because Mom's voice says.

188
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,724
You want to be somewhere else without me?

189
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,320
I'm not leaving you. Ever.

190
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,197
And you aren't leaving me.

191
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:46,992
You will never leave my side.
I won't let that happen.

192
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,789
Wherever we're together is home.

193
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:55,375
Tonight, this is home. Okay?

194
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,838
Here.

195
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,048
Go make a bed.

196
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,761
You didn't look for him.

197
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,305
I didn't see him.

198
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,683
I did. I did.

199
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:13,936
Why'd you leave him?

200
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:15,771
He told us to.

201
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,731
You just do whatever he says?

202
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,275
No. I don't do what anyone says.

203
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,152
Then why should I do what you say?

204
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,613
Because I'm keeping you alive.

205
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,202
You were right.
Those people wanted to kill us.

206
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,037
They will, if we aren't smart.

207
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,831
We are being tested.

208
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,294
The world wants to test us
to see if it can break us.

209
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,129
But it can't.

210
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:42,881
Yeah, well…

211
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,301
it did.

212
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,233
That is the word for today.

213
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:05,320
And there are celebrations like this
taking place all over the world.

214
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,823
It really is something special,

215
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,492
a moment of shared worldwide victory

216
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:14,079
unlike any the world has ever known
in its history.

217
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,636
You're walking alone.

218
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,350
Yes.

219
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,897
They say it's safe now..

220
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,651
It looks that way.

221
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,904
Where are you trying to walk?

222
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,162
The train isn't running.

223
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:39,289
The station. It's very damaged.

224
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,041
It will take time
for the trains to run again.

225
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,585
You'll need a car.

226
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,504
I don't need a car.

227
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,673
There's nowhere to stay tonight either.

228
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,594
A lot of bloodshed up there.

229
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,429
Police now. Cleaning up.

230
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,022
You're welcome to stay in the temple.

231
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:06,900
If you observe the rules.

232
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,613
I have beer.

233
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,324
And internet.

234
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:21,665
Funny. First thing they do isn't clean up

235
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,751
the blood or the bodies.

236
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,422
You should've seen them all,

237
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:33,218
two hundred people working together,
fixing cables…

238
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,387
to get their internet back.

239
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,560
You're alone too.

240
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:42,936
Mm.

241
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,233
Our Osho believed all this was a sign.

242
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,819
This "fall of the physical world"

243
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:54,615
was the Buddha's greatest test
of the mental and spiritual world.

244
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,534
A test of mastery over reality.

245
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:01,622
He meditated without food. Without water.

246
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:05,083
As the world fell, he committed fully
to the teaching of the Buddha.

247
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,211
He withdrew into the world of the mind.

248
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:13,091
And? Did he find nirvana?

249
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,012
In a way.

250
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:21,141
He starved to death.

251
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:22,726
In that room over there.

252
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,610
And the other monks?

253
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,530
They ran.

254
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:41,662
Aliens invading really has a way
of testing your beliefs.

255
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:50,128
And now, you believe in beer.

256
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:55,551
I believe this was a test.

257
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:59,805
Maybe they came here
to take everything we have,

258
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,098
to take our world…

259
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:07,604
because we've taken it for granted.

260
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:11,483
We worry about the past. The future.

261
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:14,278
We don't enjoy what we have
while we have it.

262
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,030
Monks are worst of all.

263
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:18,866
We live only in the mind.

264
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,201
We deny ourselves physical pleasures.

265
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:22,703
It's a waste.

266
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,581
A waste of this world....

267
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:27,499
of beer…

268
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:28,917
these chips…

269
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:34,631
Now I enjoy everything in this world.

270
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:40,220
Especially weed.

271
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,307
And you?

272
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,351
What do you believe?

273
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:50,564
Me.

274
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,413
I believe…

275
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,999
in memory.

276
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,003
Not memory of the past,

277
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:15,589
but memory of possibility.

278
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,133
Beer is fine.

279
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,429
But nothing is better than a dream.

280
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,435
So you live in your head too.

281
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,938
Maybe you should be the monk.

282
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:38,529
To be a monk,
you have to let go of the past. Right?

283
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:44,159
"Nekkahamma." To be free of desire.

284
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:49,706
That's true freedom. They say.

285
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:03,697
And you got from Afghanistan to here

286
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,365
after the flights were stopped?

287
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:19,505
There's blood on your vest there. Yours?

288
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:21,340
Some.

289
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:27,596
Your squad was lost in an encounter.

290
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,056
One of the first.

291
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,225
Was that your only encounter?

292
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:32,309
No.

293
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,021
You fought one?

294
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,231
A few of 'em.

295
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:41,568
And you survived,
when your whole squad was lost?

296
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,112
My squad wasn't there when we fought.

297
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,241
How did the aliens move? Together?

298
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,576
What do you mean?

299
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,661
Describe it.

300
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:00,337
All alien life and craft went dead
at nuclear detonation.

301
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,714
The tests they've done on these
show that they're identical,

302
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,842
each one of them, coded.

303
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:06,510
Yeah.

304
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:10,222
"Yeah." Describe it.
How did you stop them?

305
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,224
I didn't.

306
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,601
So then what happened?

307
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,770
They stopped pursuit? Chose a new target?

308
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,402
They were after one thing.

309
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,153
What?

310
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:29,533
Terraforming.

311
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,035
Excuse me?

312
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,079
That's what we think they were doing.

313
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:39,668
Did you see 'em spread this substance?

314
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:42,629
It metabolizes,

315
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:46,466
releases gas into the atmosphere,
changes the air.

316
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:49,887
Is that what it did?

317
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,903
Looks like you got
all your answers in here.

318
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:10,908
Aren't I supposed to fill out some form,
so I can get on a transport and go home?

319
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,871
All right.

320
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,166
Let's get you transport, Chief Cole.

321
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:22,628
Thank you.

322
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:36,934
Do you want to say goodbye?

323
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,812
You have a few moments.

324
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:08,817
Jamila!

325
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:10,986
Mum?

326
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,487
-Mum!
-My baby girl!

327
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:44,770
Can you believe it's over?

328
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:47,272
I'm going home.

329
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:52,486
Was only supposed to be here two days.

330
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:54,404
Then this.

331
00:35:57,491 --> 00:36:00,577
Only been a week since I saw my family,
but feels like forever.

332
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:03,205
You?

333
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,337
Yeah.

334
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,549
How long's it been?

335
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,055
Two years.

336
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,277
Daddy.

337
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:35,696
I love you, Daddy.

338
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:38,866
You taught me how to ride a bike.

339
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:44,663
And you got me ice cream
even when Mommy said no.

340
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,165
And…

341
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,002
you were the bad breath monster.

342
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:52,880
It was funny.

343
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,591
And…

344
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:58,177
I love you.

345
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,973
That was great, sweetheart.

346
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:09,938
Dad…

347
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,027
It's okay.

348
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,530
I'm sorry.

349
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,118
You have nothing to be sorry about.

350
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:28,832
Bye.

351
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,534
You get my message?

352
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,702
-What?
-My messages.

353
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:17,996
What?

354
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,460
I love you.

355
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,381
You.

356
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:29,716
You're all I love.

357
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:38,308
Look.

358
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:43,188
I got your letters.

359
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:45,607
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

360
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:52,781
I just got home.

361
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:57,119
I see a strange man broke into my house.

362
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:00,205
I might call 911.

363
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,876
But 911 isn't working, so…

364
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,671
maybe I'll just let him go.

365
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:11,967
But I--

366
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:15,637
What if he…

367
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:19,725
What if he doesn't wanna go?

368
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,477
Well, then I'll kick his ass
and throw him out.

369
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:25,189
'Cause he broke some things around here.

370
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:30,485
And what if he's willing to fix 'em?

371
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:33,071
He can't just put it all back together.

372
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:37,659
A new job.

373
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:42,915
Yeah?

374
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:46,835
A new job?

375
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:50,923
Yeah.

376
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:55,052
-You mean it?
-I'm here.

377
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:58,847
All right.

378
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:34,294
This yours?

379
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:36,213
Nah.

380
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:39,758
-I'ma run quick, babe.
-Yeah.

381
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:06,154
"Star."

382
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:07,739
Hey.

383
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:09,825
Baby. Baby, look.

384
00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:53,720
I wish you would just
calm down and listen.

385
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:56,932
All I do is listen.
You never shut the fuck up.

386
00:50:57,015 --> 00:51:01,979
I don't wanna fight anymore.
I think we just need some time apart.

387
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,272
Some time apart?

388
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:06,483
Yeah, you try it. You try and walk out
that door. You see what happens.

389
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:08,402
John, he can hear us.

390
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:10,445
You think I fucking care
what he hears?

391
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,621
Mum?

392
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:23,584
Dad?

393
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:35,304
There you are.

394
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,641
I was looking for you…

395
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:46,106
Looking at the stars?

396
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:56,575
You didn't open your gift.

397
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,793
Open it.

398
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:09,796
Go on.

399
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,466
It's for you.

400
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:23,936
You can see…

401
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:26,605
where you are.

402
00:52:27,773 --> 00:52:29,107
And where you're going.

403
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:32,319
You can see…

404
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:34,196
how the world pulls.

404
00:52:35,305 --> 00:53:35,529
