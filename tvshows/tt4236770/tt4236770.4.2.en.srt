3
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:40,568
Whoa.

4
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:47,327
Come on, boy.

5
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,362
Ah.

6
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:56,844
Oh.

7
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:00,086
Just making sure
I didn't spring a leak.

8
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,051
You know, there's a decent
chance I'm gonna

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,189
come unstitched
and fall in a dozen pieces

10
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:17,706
on the ground right
in front of you.

11
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:23,775
Just letting you know in advance
it ain't your fault.

12
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,362
Lord.

13
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,051
Here we go.

14
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:04,396
What in the...

15
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:13,362
Oh, goddam, it.
Are you trying to die?

16
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,948
What in the hell are you doing?

17
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:39,362
Well, the doctor said soak
in a warm bath twice a day.

18
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:42,017
I think he meant in a tub,
not on the top of a mountain.

19
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:44,775
And you're not supposed
to be riding, either.

20
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,327
He said "no driving."

21
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:48,844
Never mentioned nothing
about horses.

22
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:50,258
Well, I promise you
horses are on the list of

23
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,534
things that
you shouldn't drive.

24
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,706
You got shot.
You're on a horse.

25
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,189
I only got shot twice --

26
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,465
Well, then you win the
getting-shot-least award, Kayce.

27
00:02:58,534 --> 00:02:59,844
I don't know what to tell you.

28
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,706
No one ever got well
sitting in a fucking bed.

29
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:05,741
One thing I know about life:
when you stop moving, it's over.

30
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,017
So if riding back from
here kills me, so be it.

31
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:12,465
So, you can go on home, sonny.

32
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:14,396
I'll come back when I'm
goddam good and ready,

33
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:17,948
and if I don't you just
bury me where you find me.

34
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:19,155
I ain't going nowhere.

35
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:20,948
And if you die on the ride home,

36
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:24,362
I'll bury you next to Lee
and then I'll sit on your grave

37
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:26,189
and I'll tell you
'I told you so.'

38
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:27,948
All right, that's a deal.

39
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:37,948
Oh.

40
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:40,258
Ahh.

41
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,086
Damn, that feels good.

42
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:52,293
People been coming to heal
here for 15,000 years.

43
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:54,879
Damn right, it feels good.

44
00:03:58,327 --> 00:03:59,844
You know what I think?

45
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:03,362
I think...

46
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:06,568
God or nature or whatever
you want to call it,

47
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:11,844
gave us all these places,
these herbs, these minerals,

48
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:16,741
this... this mud,

49
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,810
all these things to fix
what happens to us

50
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,741
because God knew what a fucking
wreck we'd make of ourself.

51
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,396
Beth thinks it was Jamie.

52
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:34,120
Yeah, I know she does.

53
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:35,775
What do you think?

54
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:40,879
I think if even Jamie wanted
to hire the militia

55
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,396
they'd never do it for him.

56
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:45,051
They did it for themselves.
It's what we did to them.

57
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:49,706
You know, he didn't sell
that land for the airport,

58
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:52,017
he leased it to 'em.

59
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:54,362
He did that to keep
the ranch together.

60
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,431
And he did that for you.

61
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:59,465
Killers don't seek
their victims' approval.

62
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,982
So you think they
did it on their own.

63
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:08,465
I do.

64
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,362
How many are in that militia?

65
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:20,155
About half as many
as there used to be.

66
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:25,293
That's a half too many,
if you know what I mean.

67
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,224
Yeah.
I agree.

68
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:33,500
Use Jamie for the warrants.

69
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:35,879
We'll learn real quick
where he stands.

70
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:41,775
You're a good man, Kayce.

71
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:46,051
But sometimes good men
have to do real bad things.

72
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:51,017
Doesn't change who you are.

73
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:56,948
I just want to be really
clear about what you're asking.

74
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,327
I ain't asking anything.

75
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:03,672
I'm telling ya
we're gonna kill 'em.

76
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,258
We're gonna kill every
Goddamn one of 'em.

77
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:21,551
How many acres?

78
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,241
A thousand under this fence.

79
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,551
Another section
across the highway.

80
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,655
Warm Creek runs through
the back of this parcel,

81
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:31,551
and you got river
on the other side,

82
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,034
so there's water for
your stock year-round.

83
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:36,241
Doesn't freeze in the winter?

84
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,482
They call it Warm Creek
for a reason.

85
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:43,103
The fences look good.

86
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,793
Got a brand new set of
Priefert pens down there.

87
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,517
The Cattle are fat as ticks.

88
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,103
And it all goes with the sale:

89
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:51,551
the pens, the cattle,
the tractor, the furniture,

90
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,758
the plates in the cupboards,
all of it.

91
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,034
Why are they selling?

92
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:56,896
Owner died.
Left it to his kids.

93
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:59,482
One kid wants to keep it,
one doesn't.

94
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:02,137
One can't afford to buy the
other out, you know the deal.

95
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:05,344
Horses and cattle may
be how the West was won,

96
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:07,344
but death and taxes
is how we're gonna lose it.

97
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:08,517
No doubt about that.

98
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:23,206
What do you think?

99
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:25,586
Run pairs across the road,
hay this side.

100
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:27,172
You'll make money every year.

101
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,655
Gonna have to buy some horses.

102
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,758
Don't waste your time
with horses, son.

103
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:37,275
A Kawasaki Mule and a few good
border collies is all you need.

104
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,068
A ranch without horses is...

105
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:44,896
All them Kawasakis
eat is a little gas.

106
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:48,758
They don't get sick
and they don't buck you off.

107
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,000
Everything conveys?

108
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,965
If you pay asking price
it all conveys.

109
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,758
It's time you grew
your own shadow, son,

110
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:05,724
and you stop living
in someone else's.

111
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:11,827
Write up the offer.

112
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:15,758
I heard
Yellowstone was breaking up,

113
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:18,379
but here you are buying more.

114
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:21,000
That's what I get for listening
to the buzzards at the diner.

115
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,793
I'm not buying this
for the Yellowstone.

116
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:28,103
I'm buying this for me.

117
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:47,896
Hank!

118
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:54,000
What is that?

119
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:56,034
Don't know.
Watch out.

120
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:03,034
Buffalo?

121
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,068
Yeah.

122
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,344
It's got painting on it.

123
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:10,413
Huh?

124
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:13,862
Ho-ho, hey, ha!
Look at this!

125
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:15,379
Damn.

126
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,931
Oh, shit.
Hold up.

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,137
Hold up. Get up on out of there.
We need to call this in.

128
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,239
She's in the FBO.

129
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:55,446
You're late.

130
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,756
Your flight was early.

131
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,343
I am never early.
And I am never late.

132
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,618
I am the constant
your time adjusts to.

133
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:08,653
Apologies.

134
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,722
What a fucking mess, Ellis.

135
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,343
Agreed.
It's gotten complicated.

136
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:19,618
It's going to get
real simple real fast.

137
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:20,825
Get my bag.

138
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:27,584
Talk to me about relics.

139
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,446
The procedure is to notify
the county coroner

140
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:31,377
as well as
an archeological team,

141
00:11:31,446 --> 00:11:33,274
and the Native American
Heritage Commission...

142
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:35,687
And this will
halt our construction.

143
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:37,446
Yes.
Until?

144
00:11:37,515 --> 00:11:39,756
Until the coroner establishes
a date of the remains

145
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,618
and the archeologist removes
all artifacts from the area.

146
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:44,377
How long will that take?

147
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:46,653
Depends on whether a
university will provide funding

148
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:50,860
or the state must ask
the assembly for funds.

149
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:55,343
Explosions and ambushes
in broad daylight.

150
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:59,136
Educate me on exactly on what
the fuck I'm stepping into.

151
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,860
The violence against
the Duttons

152
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,377
is unrelated to
our conflict with them.

153
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:05,894
You really believe that?

154
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:07,929
Willa's mistake,
and your mistake

155
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:11,032
was trying to intimidate
people who'd blow up

156
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:13,343
a building at 3 o'clock
on a Friday.

157
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:16,239
This land is all they have.

158
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:20,515
Living in Montana
is just poverty with a view,

159
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:22,343
You threatened
to take that view.

160
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:25,446
From now on,
we stop stoking their fears

161
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:27,343
and feed their greed.

162
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:28,929
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,412
How long before Mr. Rainwater

164
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:34,067
files a lawsuit
to stop our build?

165
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:36,687
I expect a subpoena
by the end of the week.

166
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,550
We'll start with him, then.

167
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:41,894
Uh, Mr. Rainwater has been
unwilling to negotiate.

168
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:44,550
Unwilling to
negotiate with you.

169
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,274
Who the hell's this?

170
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:09,791
Let's find out.

171
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:17,653
Really puts on a show,
doesn't he?

172
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,860
Chairman Rainwater,
I'm Caroline Warner,

173
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,998
I chair Market Equity's
Board of Directors.

174
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:32,481
One leader falls
and another rises.

175
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:35,894
I'd hardly call this news.

176
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:38,067
They seem to think it's news.

177
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:41,825
Just because someone died here
doesn't make the land sacred.

178
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:44,791
Argue it just like that before
a circuit court, would you?

179
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,446
I don't want to
argue anything.

180
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,136
Would you walk with me?

181
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:55,412
I have a proposal.

182
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:56,722
I'm all ears.

183
00:13:57,998 --> 00:14:01,308
We rescind the cease
and desist order.

184
00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:04,584
You're free to resume building.

185
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:06,308
We can't secure our loan

186
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:09,274
without a guarantee
that you won't file another.

187
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:15,446
We'll fund the build for you.

188
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,481
Why would you do that?

189
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,860
So we have influence over what
you build, and who it caters to.

190
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,205
A casino at the center
of this development

191
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:28,481
brings an element to this
community people don't want.

192
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,963
Are you suggesting
that we don't build a casino?

193
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:34,584
I'm suggesting you build
a casino that caters

194
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:36,791
to the people
who can afford to live here.

195
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,550
Five star accommodations,

196
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:42,308
Michelin-rated restaurants,
world class entertainment.

197
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:46,170
Build a casino that is
a destination unto itself.

198
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:49,584
I'm talking about people
from across the world.

199
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,894
flying in here to ski here
at the finest resort

200
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:53,756
in the world.

201
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:56,481
Spending a thousand dollars
a night at your hotel,

202
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,791
another thousand for dinner,

203
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,825
another thousand for
tickets to see Elton John,

204
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:03,170
before they drop
twenty-five thousand

205
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,929
at your blackjack table.

206
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:06,412
Build that casino,

207
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:09,860
and we will fund your project,

208
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:13,274
and make your reservation
the richest in the nation.

209
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:15,343
In exchange for what?

210
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,343
Stop holding up the thing

211
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:22,136
that will deliver
your customers.

212
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:26,515
I'll have a contract drawn up
by the end of the week.

213
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,101
I look forward to seeing it.

214
00:15:33,963 --> 00:15:35,239
Watch out for the elk scat.

215
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:39,584
I cannot wait to pave
this place over.

216
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:43,550
So what did she say?

217
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:46,860
She offered me something
that's too good to be true.

218
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,894
Then it isn't.

219
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,825
Goddamn, I love when
Travis comes to the ranch.

220
00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:14,205
We work both those reds,
mine and the baldy.

221
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,584
You're from where? Texarkana?

222
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:18,032
Yeah, Texarkana.
Which side of the river?

223
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:19,446
North.

224
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:21,032
That is not Texas,
that is fucking Arkansas.

225
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:22,481
Don't tell people
you're from Texas.

226
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,205
Whatever you say, sir.
Don't you fucking do it.

227
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,170
Hey, brother, congratulations
on that derby win.

228
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,101
Thank you, brother.
That's a hell of a horse.

229
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,894
When you gonna
show him next?

230
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:31,343
I sold his ass
at the back gate.

231
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:32,584
You sold that horse?

232
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,170
You out of your
fucking mind, Travis?

233
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,860
Brother, my goal
is to leave every horse show

234
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,032
with an empty trailer.

235
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:42,343
Had Andy Masci
make you something.

236
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:44,618
Oh, yeah?
What's that for?

237
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,136
Little wedding present.

238
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,446
How'd you figure that
out, motherfucker?

239
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:49,894
I'm a horse trainer, brother.

240
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:51,998
When a woman goes off the market
I get a fucking email.

241
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,205
Tammy Joe!
Bring him.

242
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,963
What's this horse?

243
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:01,550
Oh, shit this is that Dual Rey
Geoffrey Sheehan was showing.

244
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:04,446
Hey, Arkansas, you study
real hard in school,

245
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:05,825
and save your allowance,

246
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:09,343
one day you might
get a horse like this.

247
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:10,515
But I doubt it.

248
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:12,929
Teeter, come grab
these horses.

249
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,481
Did Doc say it's okay
for you to be riding?

250
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,274
Yeah, well, I didn't ask.
Whoa.

251
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,136
Goddam, he gets the livestock,
doesn't he?

252
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,205
Yeah.

253
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:30,446
What are you all shopping for?

254
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:33,343
Legacy.

255
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:36,791
Look at the
King Ranch down in Texas.

256
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,481
825,000 acres.

257
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,929
The land around there
is so thick

258
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:42,170
with oil you
stab the damn ground

259
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,825
with a shovel and you find it.

260
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:47,170
How is that ranch still there,
that's the...

261
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,481
that's the question.

262
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,929
Yeah, you'd think some
big oil company

263
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:51,825
would have bought it up by now.

264
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:53,653
Well, that's cause they
got ahead of it, you know?

265
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:55,860
Started their own oil company
before one could get to 'em.

266
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,377
Their own breed of cattle, hell,
their own breed of horses,

267
00:17:58,446 --> 00:17:59,481
not a damn horse in that arena

268
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,101
you can't trace
back to the King.

269
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,308
They made such a name
for themselves you can buy

270
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,584
a damn truck with their
brand on the seat.

271
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:13,067
That's what we're going to do.

272
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:17,963
Outside this valley,
who knows we're even here?

273
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:19,756
I'm gonna let the world
know we're here.

274
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,756
Thinking of putting
Travis on the road.

275
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,584
You know him best,
what do you think?

276
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:31,101
I mean, that fucker doesn't
do anything but win, sir.

277
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,274
Can we trust him?

278
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:35,653
I mean... He puts the "whore"
in horse trainer, Kayce.

279
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:39,860
But if he's riding for the Y,
he'll be true to it.

280
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:43,205
But mind you, he will fuck
everyone else, sir.

281
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:44,446
I mean everybody.

282
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,825
Hey, John.

283
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,274
How's he priced?

284
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:55,446
Through the roof.

285
00:18:55,515 --> 00:18:58,860
Well, what if, uh...

286
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:02,894
What if I was to put him
on the road with you,

287
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:04,756
then what does he cost?

288
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:08,791
Well, the cost is the same but
he'll pay you back in a year.

289
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,274
I'll take him.
Now show me more.

290
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:15,446
How many more?
How big you want in?

291
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:16,756
When people think of horses

292
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:19,377
I want them to think
of the Yellowstone.

293
00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:22,067
John, look, you know
this deal, all right?

294
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,274
There's no money in the oak.

295
00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:25,170
All the money's in the acorn.

296
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:27,170
So, let me go find you
a stud. give me three years--

297
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:31,239
Don't have three years.
Just get me in now.

298
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:33,756
Find me acorns on the way
to that winner's circle.

299
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:35,550
All right.
You want cutters?

300
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,481
I want all three.
John...

301
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,377
That's going to
cost a lot of money.

302
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:45,412
All right? It's gonna take
a few million to do that right.

303
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:48,343
Well...
Can you win it back?

304
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:50,446
You know what we should do?

305
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:52,791
If we're gonna do this right,
then let me do it right.

306
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,825
Let me build you a team.
All right?

307
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,308
I'll get you the best
of the best in all three,

308
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:59,377
and I will stack checks
on your desk

309
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:00,515
thick as a fucking phone book.

310
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:08,722
Do it.

311
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,101
All right.
I'll start making calls.

312
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:15,481
We can't afford to do this.

313
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,205
Yeah, well, we can't
afford not to, son.

314
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,515
Not anymore.

315
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:50,377
Oh, now you show me respect?

316
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:51,998
Don't bother.

317
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,791
Let's keep this civil,
shall we, Beth?

318
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,205
Civil, you fucking coward?

319
00:20:57,274 --> 00:20:59,205
I burned for you, Bob.

320
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:03,067
And when I say "burned"...
I mean it.

321
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:10,825
Care for a drink?

322
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,894
Uh, double Tito's,
three olives.

323
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:13,481
You mean a martini?

324
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,170
No, martinis have vermouth
and are enjoyed with friends.

325
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:20,963
I don't like vermouth
and these aren't my friends.

326
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,136
So...

327
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,791
What are we talking about?

328
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,860
Your severance package.

329
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:33,274
You fucking vultures.

330
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:36,653
Here's an idea:
don't honor the contract,

331
00:21:36,722 --> 00:21:37,929
and see what I do next.

332
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,791
We aren't concerned
with the pay out.

333
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,550
We are concerned
with the parameters.

334
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:44,687
In particular,
the non-compete clause

335
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:46,205
and the non-disclosure
agreement.

336
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:48,308
Yeah, that should concern you.

337
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:51,170
You have a history
of malicious intent--

338
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,791
Oh, you have no idea, buddy.

339
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:02,963
I doubt they can shrivel any
more, but it was worth a shot.

340
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:06,515
I made you a fortune.

341
00:22:08,998 --> 00:22:10,170
A fortune.

342
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,550
And when my family was in the
fight of its life, you quit me.

343
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:21,377
Here's what I recommend,
Bob: retire.

344
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:24,791
Retire before I take
everything you fucking have.

345
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:30,756
Schwartz and Meyer owns
half the land

346
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:35,032
on the north side
of the Yellowstone:

347
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:37,239
you shouldn't pick a fight
with the bigger bear, Beth.

348
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:41,860
You co-own the land, Bob.

349
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,343
You gotta read
the fine print, Bob.

350
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:56,825
I'm the bigger bear.

351
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,829
Great.
Let's try the right hand, now.

352
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:17,381
Better today.

353
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,553
That's really good, Jimmy.

354
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:21,932
All right.
Now for the tough stuff.

355
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:33,174
Great.

356
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:35,518
Back down.

357
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:39,863
Up.

358
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:40,932
How many are we doing?

359
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:42,450
-Ten.

360
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:48,415
Can't we just fucking walk?

361
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:52,105
Walking doesn't work the
muscles we need worked, Jimmy.

362
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:54,001
You're getting
so much better, baby.

363
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,932
All right.

364
00:23:57,863 --> 00:24:00,518
I'm really encouraged
by the scans.

365
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:03,105
You're making good
progress in PT.

366
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:05,691
I think we've reached
that point, Jimmy.

367
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,105
What point?

368
00:24:07,174 --> 00:24:09,932
Your movement must be
restricted to physical therapy.

369
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:12,001
You can go to the bathroom,
you can walk from

370
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,381
one room to the next,

371
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,829
but any physical exertion
must be supervised.

372
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:18,415
And the thoracic brace stays
on 24 hours a day.

373
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:21,829
Two most dangerous places for
you: stairs and the bathroom.

374
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:23,070
A slip in the shower,

375
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:24,312
we're right back
to square one or worse.

376
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,725
Got it?
We got it.

377
00:24:25,794 --> 00:24:27,932
Discharge will take
a couple of hours.

378
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:30,346
Oh, I let the ranch know in the
hopes they could arrange a ramp,

379
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,725
and what-do-you-know,
the bunkhouse already has one.

380
00:24:32,794 --> 00:24:34,208
That's how dangerous
your job is.

381
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:35,691
You need to think about that.

382
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,070
You called the ranch?

383
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:38,898
Who did you talk to?
What did they say?

384
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:40,070
Said they were sending a car.

385
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:47,656
What's the matter, baby?
Why aren't you happy?

386
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,829
Need to show you something.

387
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:07,277
Me?
Yep.

388
00:25:08,484 --> 00:25:10,277
This boy any relation to you?

389
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:16,967
What did he do?

390
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:18,829
Tried to rob a convenience
store with a screwdriver.

391
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:20,553
You can see how that
worked out for him.

392
00:25:21,863 --> 00:25:23,794
What are you going
to do with him?

393
00:25:23,863 --> 00:25:25,932
Well, I was going to put
him in foster care

394
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:29,036
but he, uh... he claims
that you're his guardian.

395
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:31,553
I'm his what?

396
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:33,036
That's what he says.

397
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:54,139
No bullshit,
what are his odds?

398
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,863
Odds on what?

399
00:25:55,932 --> 00:25:57,794
A future.

400
00:25:57,863 --> 00:25:59,622
That's his future.

401
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,346
The world's lucky if it's drugs
that send him to prison

402
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:04,622
and not murder
or something worse.

403
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:05,760
Look, it's a horrible
thing to say,

404
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:09,036
but the best thing
for this world

405
00:26:09,105 --> 00:26:10,381
is if he goes to sleep tonight

406
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,587
and doesn't wake up
tomorrow morning.

407
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:53,656
Hello, dear.
Hello, darling.

408
00:26:54,622 --> 00:26:56,277
I made dinner.

409
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:57,967
Dinner, huh?

410
00:26:58,036 --> 00:26:59,829
Dinner.

411
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:02,036
Thank you.
What did you make?

412
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:06,381
Hamburger Helper.

413
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,450
You didn't have any hamburger
so I used tuna.

414
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:12,967
So Tuna Helper.

415
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:15,553
You put tuna
in the Hamburger Helper...

416
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:18,105
Why not just use
the Tuna Helper, darling?

417
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:23,932
They make tuna helper?

418
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:25,932
You know what, let's just go
into town, get a bite.

419
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:27,243
What do you say?

420
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,967
You should try it.
Might surprise you.

421
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:33,243
The kid sure likes it.

422
00:27:35,346 --> 00:27:37,001
The kid?
Mm-hmm.

423
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:40,484
What kid, Beth?

424
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:45,139
I think he might be
our kid, baby.

425
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,898
Who the fuck are you?

426
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,208
My name's--

427
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:02,139
You know what?
Shut up. Just shut up.

428
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,656
Who is that?

429
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,277
You, twenty years ago.

430
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:09,553
With the same options
that you had.

431
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:11,346
Look, he doesn't
have to be here.

432
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:13,760
It's your decision, but...

433
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:15,415
you're the one that's
got to tell him.

434
00:28:15,484 --> 00:28:16,587
I gotta tell him?
All right.

435
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:21,208
Boy. Get your shit
and get out of my house.

436
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:24,381
Let's go.

437
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:32,070
Sorry, kid.
We gave it our best shot.

438
00:28:35,312 --> 00:28:37,001
I don't know where to go.

439
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,277
-You got four choices.
Pick a direction.

440
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:12,450
Fucking son of a bitch.

441
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:22,794
You went to plan B
pretty quick.

442
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:24,139
What's plan B?

443
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,484
Wait until everybody
goes to sleep,

444
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:28,070
rob every car and truck
on the ranch,

445
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:29,243
like a little raccoon.

446
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:30,725
Don't you have
it all figured out.

447
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:32,174
Come here, you little shit.

448
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:33,518
Damn it.

449
00:29:34,932 --> 00:29:36,001
Go on.

450
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:40,725
Go lay on that couch
and you don't fucking move.

451
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:45,243
I'll just rob you
when you're sleeping.

452
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:46,622
I ain't sleeping.

453
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:48,277
I'm gonna sit in that
chair until the morning

454
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,070
and then I'm going to run
your ass into town.

455
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:52,863
Can he at least finish
whatever we're calling this?

456
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:59,070
Sure, why not.
Here. Here you go.

457
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:00,174
Eat up.

458
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,277
Oof.
What an appetite, huh?

459
00:30:14,174 --> 00:30:17,898
Well, I'm pooped.
Gonna head up.

460
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:23,691
Goodnight, kid.

461
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:31,243
Boy, you sure out-kicked
your coverage with that one.

462
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,139
All right, you little shit.

463
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,312
Come on, I got
a place for you.

464
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:41,656
Come on, get up.

465
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:51,484
Hey. Easy, or you're
going to get hurt.

466
00:31:00,932 --> 00:31:03,622
Bed, water.

467
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:05,105
Good night.

468
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:06,277
What about a bathroom?

469
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:10,898
Here you go.

470
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:28,070
Get up. Let's go.

471
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,346
That'll be the last
fucking thing you do.

472
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:54,415
You can drop me off anywhere.

473
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:55,760
You don't have to
take me into town.

474
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:57,656
What, so you can rob
somebody else's ranch?

475
00:31:57,725 --> 00:31:59,656
No, your ass is going to town.

476
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:01,105
All I asked for was a chance.

477
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:02,656
No, you didn't ask for shit.

478
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:04,346
You puppy dogged my lady
and she asked me.

479
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:07,415
And the answer's no.
You don't get a chance.

480
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:09,381
Ain't that the fucking truth.

481
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,415
Fuck you.

482
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:18,829
Get out of my truck.
Get the fuck out.

483
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:23,518
Get out of here.

484
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:24,794
Fuckin' smell it.

485
00:32:24,863 --> 00:32:27,070
Word of advice?
Rob a second home, not a ranch.

486
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:28,346
Maybe you won't get
fucking shot.

487
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:47,518
Fuck you, asshole.

488
00:32:58,587 --> 00:32:59,898
Shit.

489
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:16,863
Come on!

490
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,450
Come on, motherfucker!

491
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:23,656
Life doesn't give people
like you chances, kid,

492
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:25,450
if you haven't noticed

493
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:29,312
and asking for one
is a waste of Goddamn time.

494
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:31,312
So I'm supposed to just
take what I get in life?

495
00:33:31,381 --> 00:33:33,277
Get raped
in a foster home?

496
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:36,070
I've been down that road.

497
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,553
I ain't never going back.

498
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:40,312
Ask me for something else.

499
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:45,312
Like what?

500
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,381
Like a job.

501
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:50,622
Can I have a job?

502
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,001
Can you ride?

503
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,105
No.

504
00:33:56,174 --> 00:33:58,518
Can you rope?

505
00:33:58,587 --> 00:33:59,691
No.

506
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:07,415
You see that bag in the field?

507
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:08,794
Go ahead and take
your backpack off.

508
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:13,794
I want you to run out there and
I want you to grab it for me.

509
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:15,656
And just bring it back.
Go ahead.

510
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,243
There'll be no stealing,
you understand me?

511
00:34:47,312 --> 00:34:49,725
If I catch you stealing
you are fucking gone.

512
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,381
You hear me?

513
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,691
Yeah.

514
00:34:55,725 --> 00:34:57,070
All right, come on.

515
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,346
Come on.

516
00:35:40,415 --> 00:35:41,553
Fuck, get it behind you.
There we go.

517
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:45,277
There we go.
There we go.

518
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:47,518
There we go.
There it is.

519
00:35:48,587 --> 00:35:49,794
You.

520
00:35:57,415 --> 00:35:58,691
That a girl.

521
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:12,760
There we go.

522
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:15,139
Phew. Phew!

523
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:19,518
It's fuckin' nuts.

524
00:36:24,622 --> 00:36:25,656
Get that cow.

525
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:38,760
Look!

526
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:03,863
So, I got Jake on this
Metallic Cat colt.

527
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,070
I want you to buy
and put down the road.

528
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:08,587
Hey, I tell you what, I don't
know how big a name

529
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:10,587
you're trying to make, but

530
00:37:10,656 --> 00:37:11,967
you oughta let me call
Bobby Patton

531
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:14,450
and see if he'll sell you
a share of Metallic.

532
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:16,070
Cause that would make a splash.

533
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:19,622
When you jump in the
pool for me, Travis,

534
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:21,415
you do a cannonball.

535
00:37:21,484 --> 00:37:22,794
I'll do it.
Cannonball it is.

536
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,691
Hey, that, uh, bald-faced cow?

537
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,587
The one with the white belly's
good, Corey?

538
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,553
Who's this?

539
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:42,932
That there is
the new stall cleaner.

540
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,450
Looks a little young
to be going on the payroll.

541
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:49,070
No, he don't go on
the payroll. He's like me, sir.

542
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:52,174
What's your name?

543
00:37:52,243 --> 00:37:54,794
Carter, but everyone
calls me Chubby.

544
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:56,518
Don't look chubby to me.

545
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:57,967
Was when I was a baby,
I guess.

546
00:37:58,036 --> 00:38:00,553
It's what my dad called me.
Sorta just stuck.

547
00:38:00,622 --> 00:38:02,932
Where's your dad now?

548
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:04,863
Polluting the dirt
they buried him in.

549
00:38:07,312 --> 00:38:09,346
Shit.

550
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:11,450
Just like you, huh?
Yessir.

551
00:38:14,622 --> 00:38:16,622
Go stand over there
a minute, would you?

552
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,174
What in the world...
this your idea?

553
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:26,656
No, sir, it's your daughter's.

554
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:27,725
You okay with this?

555
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:29,725
Maybe.

556
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:34,691
I said maybe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no,
I got it.

557
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,794
Come on.

558
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:37,932
What did he say?
Maybe.

559
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:40,105
What does that mean?
Mean's fucking maybe.

560
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:47,587
Wet shavings and manure
goes in this wheelbarrow.

561
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:50,553
I want you to dump it out there,
big old pile, you can't miss.

562
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:53,691
Wait, what about the horses?

563
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,105
What about them?

564
00:38:56,174 --> 00:38:57,829
I gotta walk in there
with them?

565
00:38:57,898 --> 00:38:59,622
No, I want you to rappel
from the fucking ceiling.

566
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:03,794
Come here.

567
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:08,036
You walk in there
with the horse.

568
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:09,484
You clean up the shit,

569
00:39:09,553 --> 00:39:10,898
and then you close the door.

570
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:19,381
It ain't fucking
rocket science.

571
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,760
Now, let's get to it.

572
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,829
Boss is going to want
to talk to you.

573
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:31,243
Hang out here somewhere.

574
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,691
Got it?
Thanks.

575
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,174
Yeah, be careful.

576
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,518
You get the door?
Mm-hmm.

577
00:39:46,312 --> 00:39:47,829
Hey hey hey hey hey!

578
00:39:51,243 --> 00:39:53,794
Jimmy's back, sir.
Hmm?

579
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:55,381
Jimmy's back.

580
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,622
Is that the word?
Mm-hmm.

581
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:00,208
We'll be back.

582
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:06,760
Okay, all right.
Good job.

583
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,553
Boy, he sure got lucky
when he found you.

584
00:40:19,622 --> 00:40:21,070
No, I'm the lucky one.

585
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:23,829
No, honey.
You aren't.

586
00:40:24,863 --> 00:40:26,243
Can you give us a minute?

587
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,174
How do you feel?

588
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:39,243
It's weird.

589
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,277
I don't have any feeling
in the tips of my fingers,

590
00:40:41,346 --> 00:40:42,967
but they still hurt.

591
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:45,829
I don't know how
I can't feel them

592
00:40:45,898 --> 00:40:47,898
and they hurt at the same time,
you know?

593
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,277
My grandfather lost his leg.

594
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:52,415
Said the worst pain
he ever felt was in his toes

595
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,829
after his leg was gone.

596
00:40:54,898 --> 00:40:56,105
Phantom pain, they call it.

597
00:40:58,243 --> 00:40:59,794
Yeah. I guess that's
what I got.

598
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:05,794
You broke your word
to me, Jimmy.

599
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:10,829
I'm sorry.

600
00:41:10,898 --> 00:41:12,415
You broke your word.

601
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:15,622
I'm sorry, sir.

602
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,346
Tell you what, you know
I'm so...

603
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:22,932
I'm so Goddamn tired
of being right.

604
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:24,243
I told you this would happen.

605
00:41:24,312 --> 00:41:25,587
And what did I say next--

606
00:41:25,656 --> 00:41:27,105
Please don't fire me, sir.

607
00:41:27,174 --> 00:41:29,174
All right, I can still be
useful. There's all sorts--

608
00:41:29,243 --> 00:41:31,932
How?
How can you be useful?

609
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,518
You can't ride.
You can't lift anything.

610
00:41:33,587 --> 00:41:35,070
But in a few months you will

611
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:36,691
and you'll think you have
cheating fate all figured out

612
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,829
and you'll do it again
and I won't watch it happen.

613
00:41:38,898 --> 00:41:41,622
Please.
Mr. Dutton, please.

614
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:42,967
Please what? What do you
think I'm going to do?

615
00:41:43,036 --> 00:41:44,208
Kick you off the ranch?

616
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,415
I made a promise
to your grandfather,

617
00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:48,829
and unlike you, I keep my word.

618
00:41:48,898 --> 00:41:51,312
But I'm done trying to make
a man out of you, Jimmy.

619
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:53,346
I'm leaving that
to someone else.

620
00:41:58,656 --> 00:41:59,863
Who?

621
00:41:59,932 --> 00:42:01,553
It's the last favor
I call in for you.

622
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:03,139
You screw this up,
and you're on your own.

623
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:07,036
Get you packed up, Jimmy.

624
00:42:07,105 --> 00:42:08,967
Where am I going?

625
00:42:09,036 --> 00:42:11,450
Travis is pulling out of here
tomorrow, you're going with him.

626
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,105
Where?

627
00:42:15,174 --> 00:42:17,691
Where cowboying was invented.

628
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,691
And if those boys can't
make one out of you,

629
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,587
you weren't meant to be one.

630
00:42:22,656 --> 00:42:24,070
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

631
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:25,208
It wasn't my decision.

632
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:50,163
Nah, nah, nah.
Close the stall.

633
00:43:00,025 --> 00:43:02,094
I'm going to teach
you a trick

634
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,198
so that you don't blow
this opportunity.

635
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:08,543
Don't think that you deserve it.

636
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:11,922
You don't deserve it.

637
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,439
And you never will.

638
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,370
You don't deserve it?

639
00:43:20,439 --> 00:43:21,612
No one deserves it.

640
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,060
All right.
Come on.

He shouldn't drink.

I was pretty certain
that you'd dropped him off

on the highway somewhere.

This looks good, sweetie.

677
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,612
Yeah, I think I got this whole
cooking thing figured out.

678
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:41,784
Oh, yeah?
Let me see.

679
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,094
Mmm.

680
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:47,474

00:46:01,543 --> 00:46:03,163
What?

682
00:46:03,232 --> 00:46:04,750
Nothing.

683
00:46:14,922 --> 00:46:16,336
This, uh...

684
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:17,887
This makes you happy,
don't it?

685
00:46:17,956 --> 00:46:19,991
It does.

686
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,232
Want to know why?

687
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:24,818
Cause you got a mean streak
like a fucking badger.

688
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:31,405
Here, have some more.

689
00:46:58,301 --> 00:46:59,301
Oh, shit.

690
00:47:01,336 --> 00:47:02,646
I'm in trouble.

691
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:05,750
Already?
What did you do?

692
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:10,232
Rip told me to be
the first to the barn.

693
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:11,336
And I'm not.

694
00:47:11,405 --> 00:47:12,612
Well, I don't count.

695
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:14,198
Not working. This is, uh...

696
00:47:16,474 --> 00:47:17,853
Physical therapy.

697
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:20,025
That's right, you got shot.

698
00:47:20,094 --> 00:47:21,336
Yep.

699
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,508
Bet that smarts.

700
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:24,163
Don't recommend it.

701
00:47:24,232 --> 00:47:26,301
Why don't you get up here
and open this door for me?

702
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,336
Where you going?

703
00:47:48,405 --> 00:47:51,336
Don't know.
Just going.

704
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:55,474
You were the first one here.

705
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:57,370
No, not really.

706
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,646
No, sir, you were the first.

707
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:03,336
That's a good sign.
You keep it up.

708
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:04,956
Rip told me the trick.

709
00:48:05,025 --> 00:48:06,577
Yeah?

710
00:48:06,646 --> 00:48:08,439
Never think I deserve it.

711
00:48:11,508 --> 00:48:14,474
Yeah, well...
No one deserves it.

712
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:16,405
But you try to anyway.

713
00:48:17,405 --> 00:48:18,405
That's what he said.

714
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:23,681
Well, if I don't come back
you send out the search party.

715
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,646
Where do I send 'em?

716
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:28,577
Don't know where you're going.

717
00:48:28,646 --> 00:48:30,267
Guess they'll have to
earn the title, then, huh?

717
00:48:31,305 --> 00:49:31,779
