You know, if being here
is so terrible for you, Beth,

164
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,355
- you can go back to Salt Lake.
- You asked for advice.

165
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
I gave it.

166
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,714
Well, you know, I'm not gay. I'm celibate.

167
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,071
Because I am terrified
to get somebody pregnant,

168
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,640
pass on the gene that made you.

169
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,315
Good one.

174

You don't have a solution?

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,919
It requires a few.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,798
And you're not gonna like any of them.

177

Not yet.

Who are the agents we're talking about?

180
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,433
It's, uh, Tom Reynolds and Aaron McReary.

181
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,796
Reynolds I can deal with.

182

I don't know this McReary.

183
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,751
Yeah, he lives in

Yeah, that would be my guess.

- It means they're doctors.

let them dig up my son?

- No, don't say it.

It's not uncommon

491

to doubt one's faith

FATHER BOB: False witness.

507
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,758
It seems odd that God
would find it necessary

508
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,198
to make two Commandments
that instruct us not to lie.

509
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,594
But the Ninth Commandment
has nothing to do with lying.

510
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,354
It is about your neighbor,

511
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,311
the men and women
sitting here with you today.

512
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,920
It's about your flock.

513
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,433
It is about your shepherds.

514
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,709
And one of our shepherds is suffering.

515
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,275
The pain of his loss
reverberates throughout this congregation.

516
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,918
And his suffering is not over.

517
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,433
Because Satan has found an open window

518
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,637
and he is climbing through.

519
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,672
The Ninth Commandment forbids

520
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,275
speaking against your neighbor
in any manner.

521
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,718
It forbids you
from destroying his reputation

522
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,197
or threatening his position
or the sanctity of his family.

523
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,000
Because his family is your family.

524
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,720
His flock is your flock.

525
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,992
But Satan does not attack the flock.

526
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,990
He attacks the shepherd.

527
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,360
He attacks him by tricking your mind.

528
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,595
By making you see
what he wants you to see.

529
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,359
And when he has destroyed the shepherd,

530
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,119
we are a flock no more.
