1
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:11,227
Man, do they realize how many times
 they could have gotten off this island
 if it weren't for Gilligan?

2
00:00:11,227 --> 00:00:14,114
Why don't they just kill him?

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,093
Just because a person is a useless pest
 doesn't mean they deserve to die.

4
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:23,645
Hello, hello. / Of course
 that's not written in stone.

5
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:25,160
Brighten, are you still sitting here?

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,468
Doesn't Miss Fine have anything to say
 about you wasting all day watching television?

7
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:31,897
Did Lovey redecorate the hut yet?

8
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,880
Miss Fine, why has Brighten been watching 
this "Gilligan" show all morning?

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,143
Well, it's a marathon.

10
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:46,032
Plus, we want to see when they change
 the theme song from  "All the Rest"
 to "The Professor and Marianne ..."

11
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:49,110
Brighten, don't you have
 any interest in a team sport?

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,739
Only as an owner.

13
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:54,624
Oh, I don't know.  I just don't
 understand it, Miss Fine.

14
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:57,782
When I was his age, I was already
 captain of the water polo team.

15
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:02,692
Water polo?  What do 
you swim with horses?

16
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:07,385
What happens when they raise 
their tails?  Look out.

17
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:12,703
Aspirin, Ibuporfen, 
or shall I just surprise you?

18
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:14,992
You know what?  I gotta go 
into Queens anyway.

19
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,611
Why don't I just take Brighten 
with me to the batting cages.

20
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,802
A lot of guys always hang out that. 
 I know I always had fun.

21
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:25,353
You played baseball?
 / Yeah.

22
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:28,904
I just wish Brighten was interested in 
some of the sports I played.

23
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:31,213
Look, you can't make your kid
 like what you like.

24
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:34,323
My mother always made me go
 with her to her ballet classes.

25
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:36,957
Your mother took ballet?  
What must that have been like?

26
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:40,824
Picture the hipopotamuses 
in "Fantasia."

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

28
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,580
Hi, Ma.  Well, 
so much for sports.

29
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,722
Brighten got hit with a ball.

30
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:41,276
Oh, those batting cages
 are so dangerous.

31
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:43,734
You could put an eye out.

32
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:46,996
He wishes. 
/ Ohhhhhhh ...

33
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,685
You want grandma 
to kiss the boo-boo?

34
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,698
Isn't it enough I got 
one kid in therapy?

35
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:09,646
Honey, go in and watch the "Gilligan"
 marathon with my father.

36
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:14,148
If it looks like he's wearing lipstick,
 it's just the pistachio nuts.

37
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:18,920
Morty, the boy's coming in. 
 Do up your pants.

38
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:25,164
Sweetheart, we gotta talk to you
 about the canasta tournament.

39
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:28,413
Oh, I'm so excited about 
going to Atlantic City.

40
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:31,843
But I'm not rooming with Gert. 
 It's one thing to think you're Madonna.

41
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:35,920
It's a whole another thing to wear
 your Depends on the outside.

42
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:38,476
Don't worry.  
We're out of the tournament.

43
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:43,034
Gert moved.  Her youngest bought
 a mother-daughter condo in Florida.

44
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:46,154
Why?  I mean, how nice.

45
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:49,138
Now we don't have a fourth.

46
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:53,546
I'll look in my phone book.  
Maybe I can find someone else.

47
00:03:53,546 --> 00:03:57,709
Tessie Fink, she's good.
 / Ma, she's dead.

48
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,361
She is?  I just saw her in temple.

49
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,785
Didn't you think it was odd that
 you were sitting in a chair

50
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,602
and she was lying in a box?

51
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:12,110
Oh, I thought they got 
that for her back.

52
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:20,391
Morty's nauseous.  He says he wants 
the leftover Chinese food to settle his stomach.

53
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:26,169
Morty, it's been in there a week. 
 Do you want to end up in intensive care?

54
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:29,176
You ate it for breakfast, Ma? 
/ Yeah.

55
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,329
She doesn't even bother
 to warm it up.

56
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,906
She sticks her fork in,
 pulls the carton off,

57
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:42,435
and eats it like a giant Chinese
 Dove bar.  Ahhhhh ...

58
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:45,038
So tell me, what episode 
are they up to?

59
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:47,387
Ah, Marianne thinks she's Ginger.

60
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:51,647
Oh, and she cut down all Ginger's gowns. 
Oh, that gave me nightmares.

61
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:53,946
It scared her more than "Psycho."

62
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:59,634
Yes, butchering Janet Leigh was
 nothing compared to butchering
 that strapless Oleg Cassini.  Hu-huh.

63
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:03,680
There is no excuse for violence 
like that on television.

64
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,681
This is a lot like rummy, right? 
/ It's much more complicated.

65
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:10,703
You melt? / Yeah.

66
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:13,246
Two decks?
 / Uh-huh.

67
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:18,148
See if you can keep up with me because
 I have a tendency to play too fast.

68
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:22,887
I'm out. 
/ Wow, B, that's amazing.

69
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:25,223
I've never seen anything like that.

70
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:28,588
He must be one of those special 
people that has a knack.

71
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:32,585
What are they called?
 / Idiots.

72
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:37,317
Savants, Yetta. 
 Cousin Marty was an idiot.

73
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,588
Although, he could 
look up in the sky

74
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:43,757
and tell you which pigeon was
 going to poop on him.

75
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:46,857
Yeah, but did he move?  No.

76
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,144
This is cool.  All right, ladies. 
 Cut the chitchat.  Deal.

77
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:54,520
Are you thinking 
what I'm thinking?

78
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,991
Yeah.  That we should
 replace Gert with Brighten

79
00:05:56,991 --> 00:06:00,475
and make him our fourth
 in Atlantic City. / Nah.

80
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:06,867
I shouldn't eat stuffed cabbage 
this close to a pilot light.

81
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:16,453
You know, dad was right.

82
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,509
It feels really good to be 
a member of a team.

83
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,840
Now, next week do I bring knishes
 or low-sodium bunt cake?

84
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:28,645
You know, honey, why don't you let me
 tell your father the good news 
about being on the team

85
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:35,346
cause you know he's just going to die,
 and I may not be far behind.

86
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:38,970
Ah, Niles, let me ask you a question. 
/ Uh-huh.

87
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,822
If you only had one son

88
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:48,155
and he decided that he wanted to play
 on my grandmother's canasta team,

89
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:51,039
how would you react?

90
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,589
Oh, I've got to be in there for this.

91
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,184
I want to see, too. 
/ Oh, what's your cover?

92
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,205
I can pretend I'm dusting.

93
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:01,559
Well, I'll tell him
 I need a book.

94
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:05,234
Amateur.  You're not 
ready for that room.

95
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:08,507
Oh, sweetheart, the office
 is for heavy hitters.

96
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:13,984
Next time in the kitchen giving your father 
a coronary, you'll be the first I call.

97
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:17,981
Maxwell, perhaps 
I'm being overly sensitive,

98
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:22,102
but I think Niles has it in for me.

99
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,487
Cee Cee, it's just his way. 
He doesn't mean you any harm.

100
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,141
I'm sure it's all in your head ...

101
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:42,866
So, Miss Fine, back from the batting 
cages?  How did my boy do?

102
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:48,031
Well, he made contact with the ball.

103
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,323
And he'll have a great career 
if the Bee Gee's ever get back together.

104
00:07:54,776 --> 00:08:00,058
Would you look at her in the middle of the day.
  Boy, I wish I could sleep like that.

105
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,884
Maxwell, Niles hit me in the head.

106
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,741
Cee Cee, he's standing way over here.

107
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:09,806
Stop picking on the man.

108
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:13,384
She never let's up, sir.

109
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:16,495
Did you want something, Niles?

110
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,963
Can't the butler just 
come in and say hi?

111
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:22,797
All right.  What are you two up to?

112
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:24,494
Nothing, nothing.

113
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:27,490
Well, baseball didn't exactly
 work out for Brighten,

114
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,654
but he did find a game, and
 he's very excited about it.

115
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:35,791
Well, there you are, you see, I told you there'd
 be an alternative to television. / Yep.

116
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,604
So, come on, what's the game? 
 Soccer?  Hockey?

117
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:41,617
Well, you need to fill me in. 
 I need to know what equipment to buy.

118
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:47,387
Well, maybe a nice teflon bunt
 pan might come in handy.

119
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,627
Okay.  I'm just going to spill it.

120
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:55,317
Because it's best to tell people stuff instead of 
letting it fester inside and then you babble on and on --

121
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,020
Miss Fine. 
/ Canasta.

122
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,214
Canasta?  Doesn't your mother 
and grandmother play --

123
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:06,400
Miss Fine, you're not telling me my son is
 joining your mother's canasta team?

124
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,811
No.  It's Yetta's team.

125
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:14,516
Look, maybe you misunderstood me. 
I wanted him to play a manly sport,

126
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:21,214
you know, toughen him up a little.
 / Well, some of the teams have men, I think.

127
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:27,638
At a certain age the hormones go.  
So that's anybody's guess really.

128
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,317
Oh, God, this is sounding 
worse by the minute.

129
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:34,133
Next you're going to tell me
 they have a uniform.

130
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:39,893
Oh, well, now, they're very tough, masculine, 
pink bowling uniforms with a name on it.

131
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:45,228
Oh, no.  It's going to be something 
awful like "Flushing Queens."

132
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:49,097
Oh, my God, you mean that's it?

133
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,723
What?  My only son is going
 to be wearing a jacket

134
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:56,326
that says "Brighten" on the front 
and "Flushing Queen" on the back?

135
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,836
No.  His will say "Gert."

136
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:03,466
Oh, I, I better take care of that. 
 I better take care of that before

137
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:07,075
the contest in Atlantic City. 
/ Are you insane?

138
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:10,006
You, you don't actually think 
I'm going to let him go.

139
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:15,002
And if you're going to pretend you're dusting there,
 at least put a bloody cloth in your hands.

140
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:21,003
Maxwell, if the child has a knack. 
 I was good at hunting.

141
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:23,677
But mommy said I excelled at trapping.

142
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:29,430
Oh, take good care of your teeth, sir.
  You may need to gnaw off a leg some day

143
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:38,025
Mr. Sheffield, you're
 worrying for nothing.

144
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:41,806
I had a friend, Pauly Russo.
  He was raised by two grandmothers.

145
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:45,176
He turned out to be the most masculine of men.

146
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:52,159
You should see him today -- 
big black mustache, leather cap, chaps.  Humm ...

147
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:55,612
Miss Fine!

148
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:03,449
Ma, all these cards are
 sticking together.

149
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:09,826
Ah, it's a little crystal light.

150
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:15,643
Now I'm in the mood for something sweet.

151
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:21,729
Well, here.  Try this queen of hearts. 
I think it's got some Smucker's on the back.

152
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:26,133
You know, if I didn't know any better,
 I'd think someone was marking these cards.

153
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,053
What?

154
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:38,425
Ma, you've been cheating all these years,
 and we still lose?

155
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:41,114
No hitting during the game.

156
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:45,632
I could fight my own battles. 
/ Can we play?  Hey!

157
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:49,198
Now you're part of the family.

158
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:52,536
I can't wait to hit the buffet 
tables in Atlantic City.

159
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:55,789
He's got a safari jacket
 with 14 pockets in it.

160
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:59,718
We'll never have to order room service.

161
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,356
Didn't you tell her?

162
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:05,103
What's the matter, Ma?

163
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:10,135
You got that look on your face like right
 before you weigh in at Jenny Craig.

164
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:13,942
Brighten, take this into Morty.

165
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:20,761
If it looks like he's wearing rouge it's
 just some residue from the barbecue potato chips.

166
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,022
So what's going on?

167
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:27,502
Gert's back from Florida.

168
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:30,889
She found an alligator in the pool.

169
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:34,641
She thought it was an inflatable one.

170
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:38,097
PS -- 80 stitches.

171
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:43,612
Wow.  What does she think?  She's going to
 waltz herself back in on the team?  Tough.

172
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,313
Not after what I went through
 with Mr. Sheffield.

173
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:50,521
I'm not breaking that little boy's heart. 
 I'm not telling him he's out.

174
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,336
Good.  Cause he's not.

175
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:56,821
Well, who then?

176
00:12:57,518 --> 00:13:00,989
Franny, you're such a pretty girl.

177
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:10,398
Oh, Mommy, fire that maid.
  She's too old.

178
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:17,312
Oh, she fished me out of that lake years ago. 
 How long is she going to milk that?

179
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:18,376
Uh-huh.

180
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:25,665
No, no, I'm having lunch 
with Betsy.  Ha, ha, ha.

181
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:29,756
Uh-huh. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

182
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:34,950
No, wait till she sees me. 
 I look like a million bucks.

183
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:39,182
Oh, all right.

184
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:43,006
Niles ...  Yetta just called,

185
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:46,246
apparently Brighten showed up for
 practice without all his equipment.

186
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:48,378
Excuse me, sir, but I packed
 his gear myself.

187
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:54,797
Well, you forgot the Lipton onion soup mix
 and the non-fat sour cream.

188
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:57,986
Well, don't look at me like that, Niles.

189
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:01,476
I just wanted Brighten to be involved 
in something a little more virile.

190
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:07,873
Like musical theater?  Well, at least 
your father was supportive of that.

191
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:12,735
Niles, don't you remember?  He refused to come 
to my first production, "Sound of Music."

192
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,827
I staged that when I was just 17

193
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:18,241
and all because I wouldn't
 do what he wanted me to --

194
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:23,924
shut up, Niles.  Book me 
a suite in Atlantic City.

195
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:29,525
Done, sir.  Trump Castle, ocean views 
for the entire family, 
and I can't wait to hit the slots.

196
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:32,495
Well, mind you, with Miss Fine in the tournament,
 you'll have to take care of the children.

197
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:35,389
Oh, that sounds like fun.

198
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,392
Oh, dear. I think
 I'm coming down with something.

199
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,527
It's getting worse.

200
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:48,198
Can't go.  Damn.

201
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:54,573
Ah, Niles, you got any seltzer?

202
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:58,009
Oy, I had too much pickled herring. 
 It's all right here.

203
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:03,619
Oh, my God.
 / Edelweiss, edelweiss.

204
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:05,714
All right, all right. 
 You win, Miss Fine.

205
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:11,013
If Brighten really wants to play canasta,
 then I suppose I should let him to follow his dream.

206
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:14,090
Oh, what dream?  Playing cards
 with a bunch of old ladies.

207
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,948
I think it's sick.
 / What?  What about the tournament?

208
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,270
I thought you were thrilled to be
 going to Atlantic City.

209
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:25,457
That pit? / Oh, God, I can feel those 
capillaries tightening at the base of my skull.

210
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:29,496
Miss Fine, weren't you the one that
 was so high on canasta?  What happened?

211
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,468
They threw me off the team.

212
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:35,234
They don't want to play
 with you anymore?

213
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:39,789
No. And it's not fair. 
 They were my friends first.

214
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:43,124
You, you mean my son is 
on the team and you're not?

215
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:45,369
Yes.

216
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:48,322
Miss Fine, it's all right.

217
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:53,331
No.  It's not.  And I'm not going
 to Atlantic City either.

218
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:55,510
There, there, come on now.

219
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,425
We've already made reservations for
 the whole family.  Isn't that right, Niles?

220
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,801
Oh, ah-choo.

221
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:05,075
No. / Saltwater taffy ...

222
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:06,492
No.

223
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:10,415
Your own suite, lots of
 little shampoos? / No.

224
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:16,352
Ringside seats to Steve and Edie.
 / Cocktail or dinner show?

225
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:26,837
Come on, baby, go, baby ... Go, Mama needs a
 -- mama needs a papa.  That's what Mama needs.

226
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:31,392
Oh ... Ahhhhh!

227
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,801
You see, I told you, you have to 
stick with the same machine.

228
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:41,907
It's a whole system.  God, 
there must be twenty bucks here.

229
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:44,339
Oh, Fran, you put in seventy five.

230
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:49,092
Yeah, but that was from the winnings of 
the hundred that I put into that machine.

231
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:53,155
Oh, you know, I better go pick up
 Gracie at casino camp.

232
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:57,253
It's about time.  She must be 
finished playing kiddie craps.

233
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:59,929
Oh, I'll go pick her up.  
I have a tennis lesson anyway.

234
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:05,499
Tennis?  Oh, all that running back
 and forth, back and forth.

235
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:10,746
Now that's a sport I never got. 
/ Fran, there's the instructor.

236
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:19,598
Now I get it.

237
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:25,211
Fran, I hope you're not mad at me because
 I took your place on the team.

238
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:29,237
Oh, no, sweetie, I love you.

239
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:35,090
But she could look like Z.Z. Tutt before
 I ever pluck a chin hair of hers again.

240
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,140
Sweetheart, don't be angry at me.

241
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,278
I had to think of the team's survival.

242
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:46,010
Remind me never to crash
 in the Andies with you.

243
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,232
Sweetheart, you know I'd eat you last.

244
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:56,874
Not if I was the only kosher corpse.

245
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:05,376
Oh, boy, I hope you guys have tickets 
because, you know, they're sold out

246
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:08,153
We know.

247
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:13,382
Oh, my God,

248
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:18,216
didn't you teach at PS 165?

249
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:23,755
No. / Oh, gee, 
you look so familiar.  What do you do?

250
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:28,396
We sing. 
/ Oh, I get it.

251
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:33,620
You do them in that impersonation show. 
/ Yes.

252
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,134
Oh, ya, you could pass.  You know,
 the right lights, makeup, costume.

253
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:40,810
You, I don't know.
 / Oh, really?

254
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,511
Well, listen to this you're 
walking along the street ...

255
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:48,113
or you're at a party, or else you're
 alone and then you suddenly dig.

256
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:50,763
No, no, no, no, no.  First of all,

257
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:56,880
you've got to put a lot more
 shoulder into it.

258
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,234
And you, you gotta look at him 
more adoringly.  You love him, baby.

259
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:06,121
You looking in someone's eyes, 
you suddenly realize

260
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:09,533
that this could be the start 
of something big ...Hey, hey.

261
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,126
Not bad.

262
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:16,461
You just gotta work on that chemistry
 a little bit cause, you know,

263
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:21,642
that is the magic between
 Steve and Edie, see.

264
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:24,534
Thank you. 
/ Good luck.

265
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:27,543
I told you, you have to look at me adoringly. 
/ I always look at you adoringly.

266
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,209
People are starting to notice that.

267
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:35,666
Oh, it's so sad.  Some people 
are living in such a dream world.

268
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,433
Wow, I can't believe 
all this food's for free.

269
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:49,247
Yeah.  And if you count your losses,
 it only comes out to $49 a shrimp.

270
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:53,837
Right.  Eat up. 
 I lost my shirt in kiddie craps.

271
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:58,514
What are I doing?
 / What?  I love three-bean salad.

272
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:00,846
What is this?  Your first buffet?

273
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:06,160
Salads are for suckers. 
 Go directly to the shell fish.

274
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:13,444
Oh, would you just look at
 this beautiful gulf prawn,

275
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:17,479
gorgeous color, great markings.

276
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:20,528
This will be delicious later.

277
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:22,298
Come on, everyone.

278
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:24,625
Hurry up.  The tournament's
 going to start soon.

279
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,428
Miss Fine, where's your mother?
  Too nervous to eat?

280
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:32,351
Please, she had a snack
 during her hysterectomy.

281
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:35,919
Oh, is it warm in here 
or I'm svitzing?

282
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,197
Oh, honey, are you okay?

283
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:42,095
No.  I don't think I can play.  
You better make up with your mother.

284
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:45,178
Well, what hurts? 
/ Oy, I think I'm going through the change.

285
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:48,720
It's going around.  
The whole room's got it.

286
00:20:49,523 --> 00:20:55,894
Well, don't worry, B. I'm sure that
 Flintstones make a chewable estrogen.

287
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,838
Honey, I know what you're doing,
 and it's so sweet of you.

288
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:04,803
Oh, come on, Fran, playing means
 more to you than it does to me.

289
00:21:04,803 --> 00:21:07,479
Besides, I already
 told them I quit.

290
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:10,783
Oh, is he a doll or what?

291
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,809
Brighten, that's a very nice gesture.
  I'm, I'm proud of you.

292
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,193
I learned from the best.
 / Oh, well.

293
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,310
Not you, Dad, Gilligan.

294
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:26,944
Oh, yeah, that was the episode where
 the Howells adopt Gilligan,

295
00:21:26,944 --> 00:21:32,416
only he pretends to sleepwalk
 because the skipper is lonely.

296
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:36,843
Oh ...  Well, Miss Fine, come on,
 if the team needs you, I suppose you better get in there.

297
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:40,645
Are you kidding? 
 The way my mother treated me,

298
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:44,184
she can come in here
 on her hands and knees begging,

299
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:45,930
I wouldn't go.

300
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,096
Franny, you're in.
 / All right.

301
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:55,287
What?  Was that any mother?

302
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:01,152
Poor sick Niles, 
home alone like a dog.

303
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:56,630
You realize, of course, 
now I'm going to have to kill you.

304
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,066
Yetta, if you're going to mark 
your cards, at least do it smaller.

305
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,939
I can't believe Gertie defected
 to another team.

306
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:18,453
Ah, she's missing a chunk from 
that alligator bite. It's a big turnoff.

307
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:22,936
Well, at least we got ourselves 
a fourth. / Aha!

308
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:26,674
That's the card you're playing?

309
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
