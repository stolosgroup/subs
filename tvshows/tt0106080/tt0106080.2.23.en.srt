1
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:06,745
Hey, Fran, did you see?  
Billy Ray Cyrus is having a kissing contest

2
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:09,572
at Tower Records to find a girl
 for the cover of his new album.

3
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:11,587
Oh, I love Billy Ray Cyrus.

4
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:14,335
Remember that cowboy bar 
we used to go to in Flushing?

5
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:17,434
Of course.  
I'm not just rock 'n roll,

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,744
I'm a little bit country, too.

7
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:23,614
Oh, they used to have 
a mechanical bull.

8
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:27,337
I used to ride that
 thing like crazy.

9
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:32,670
Oh, I'll tell you, if he was Jewish
 I would have married him.

10
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:36,990
So, are you gonna enter?
 / Oh, are you kidding?  I'd never win.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,026
Pamela Chapman is entering.

12
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:41,943
Oh, she's so gorgeous,
 even her mother hates her.

13
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:46,434
Oh, sweetie, you've got to have
 more self-confidence.

14
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:49,667
All of those overdeveloped girls 
just peak in high school.

15
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,887
Yeah.  Remember that girl from our school
 who was so beautiful and so popular

16
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,521
that everyone thought she would own 
the world?  Then her fiance dumped her,

17
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:02,457
she got fired from her job,
 and she wound up working as a nan --

18
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:08,724
Fran, were you ever in
 a kissing contest?

19
00:01:08,724 --> 00:01:13,071
Well, I wouldn't exactly 
call it a contest.

20
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:18,902
I mean, how many contestants 
can you fit in a '77 Comet?

21
00:01:19,089 --> 00:01:27,774
But I must say, Jerry Swartz and I spent 
the better part of the "Blue Lagoon" tongue wrestling.

22
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:33,091
You mean thumb wrestling? 
/ Oh, yes, of course, honey. 
That's exactly what I meant.

23
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:36,092
Thanks for correcting me.

25
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:29,030
Fran, why am I doing this? I don't 
have a chance of winning a kissing contest.

26
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,269
Sweetie, you could do it 
with your eyes closed.

27
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,224
Well, actually, you do it
 with your eyes open.

28
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:37,232
Fran, you spy on me and Shawn
 when we're making out?

29
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:43,038
Honey, spying and living vicariously
 are two completely different things.

30
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:45,976
Shawn? What happened to Peter?

31
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:50,862
Oh, he's got a bad hair cut.
 He'll be back in a couple of weeks.

32
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:57,194
Oh, that's Shawn. Oh, how am I going to tell
 him that I'm entering a kissing contest?

33
00:02:57,194 --> 00:03:01,641
Sweetie, just slip it into 
the conversation.  Be subtle.

34
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:04,319
Hi, Shawn.
 / Hi, Maggie.

35
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,923
Hi, Fran.
 / Hi, sweetie.

36
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:12,161
Oh, look at this, a kissing contest. 
/ Oh, let's enter.

37
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:21,288
Meanwhile, she's fighting 'em off with a stick,
 and I'm having impure thoughts about Judge Ito ...

38
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:31,361
Honey, you might as well tell Shawn. 
Now is as good a time as any.

39
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,784
Wrong!  Red alert!  
Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!

40
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,265
Mating season in Queens, Miss Fine? 
/ Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!

41
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:42,391
Hello, darling, how's my little girl?

42
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:48,612
Margaret ...

43
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,927
Margaret?  Oh, my God.

44
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,294
Dad! / Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.

45
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:58,084
Um, it's a -- a Peter, right?

46
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:01,460
Shawn, daddy. 
/ Oh, yes, right.  Ah, Shawn.

47
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,683
Well, of course, in England Peter
 is short for Shawn,

48
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:08,737
which is one of 
the many reasons why I left.

49
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:11,121
Let me show you how to be subtle.

50
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:17,586
Speaking of England, does everybody know 
that Billy Ray Cyrus is holding a kissing contest

51
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:21,369
to see what girl is going to be
 on the cover of his latest CD?

52
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:23,141
Kissing contest, huh? 
/ Uh-huh.

53
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:27,858
Yeah.  Not a bad ruse to get thousands
 of girls to corrupt. / I'll tell you ...

54
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:30,772
Tough job, hey, lad?

55
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:35,017
Man, think about it.  Girls lining up
 all dying to kiss you ...

56
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:36,985
Nah.  When I'm in that situation,

57
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,552
I pick out the prettiest girl; 
I take her home;

58
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:44,821
she puts on something sexy, 
and then I ...

59
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:49,870
wake up, and Niles makes me
 a really big bowl of Captain Crunch.

60
00:04:54,588 --> 00:05:00,147
Speaking of Captain Crunch, I guess it's
 no problem that Maggie enters the contest.

61
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:01,202
What? / What?

62
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:03,485
Maggie, I'm not letting you do this.

63
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,747
Shawn, you can't tell me what to do. 
 You don't own me.

64
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:09,508
Absolutely right.  I do.
  Margaret, no contest.

65
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,941
Oh, come on, daddy,
 all my friends are doing it.

66
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:15,657
Ah, Maggie, Maggie, Oz has spoken.

67
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:17,671
Good-bye.  Go.

68
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:20,494
Take the Dutch boy.

69
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:25,206
Ohhh ...  You're going to work on him.

70
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:29,484
Ohhh, so you're going to work on me, hey?

71
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:32,717
No, Mr. Sheffield, I am not 
going to work on you.

72
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:35,999
In fact, I happen to agree with you.
 / I beg your pardon?

73
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:41,038
Well, you saw how upset Shawn got.  I mean,
 he can't stand the thought of her kissing anyone else.

74
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,603
If she enters the contest,
 it could bust those two kids up.

75
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:49,071
We'd never see Shawn again.

76
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,557
Ah, Miss Fine ... / Yes?

77
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:55,743
Perhaps you're being a little too harsh 
on Margaret. / Oh, am I?

78
00:05:55,743 --> 00:06:01,399
Well, yeah.  I mean, after all, all of 
her friends are going to be doing it. / Oh, okay.

79
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,692
Standing in line for hours 
reminds me of home.

80
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,705
You know, we only had one bathroom.

81
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:24,075
My father would go in with the Sunday morning paper 
and not come out until "Murder She Wrote."

82
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:27,462
Fran, I don't stand a chance. 
 All these girls are so sexy.

83
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:31,011
Oh, sweetie, they've got nothing on you.

84
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:35,636
In fact, you've got something that
 they lost a long time ago.

85
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:38,125
You still got it, don't you?

86
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,295
Oh, no.  There's Pamela Chapman.

87
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:45,067
That gorgeous, stuck-up snob. Hi.

88
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:48,132
Oh, sweetie, she's no threat to --

89
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:53,271
wow! I didn't know Brad Pitt
 and Claudia Schiffer had a kid.

90
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:59,311
All right, well, honey, you just go 
in there and get it over with ...

91
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:05,501
Ah, you, honey, come here.

92
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,842
I'm from Homina, Homina Records,

93
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:12,711
and you don't need to wait in line.
 You made the cut. / Really?

94
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:17,042
Ssshhh!  Ssshhh!  You know what would
 happen if anyone found out that I was here?

95
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,223
Now write this down.

96
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:26,062
Now, go to, ah, 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

97
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,733
Ask for Lilly or Herman.
 / Thank you.

98
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:37,443
Oh, I feel terrible.  So awful.

99
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:41,419
You, honey, come here. 
 I'm from Homina Homina --

100
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,387
Fran, Fran ... Oh, my gosh,
 that was so cool.

101
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:52,821
He is so cool.  This is so cool. 
You've gotta do it.

102
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:56,577
Oh, what?  Are you kidding? 
/ Oh, why not?  For a goof.  Come on.

103
00:07:56,577 --> 00:08:01,940
Oh, sweetie, I came here for you.  
I'm not gonna waltz myself up to Billy Ray Cyrus,

104
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,980
throw my arms around his neck, 
and suck those farm boy lips off.

105
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,681
I wouldn't know where to begin.

106
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:14,748
Oh, come on.  Go for it. 
 It's really fun, Fran.

107
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:18,964
Well, it's fun for you to kiss 
a celebrity, but I get kissed --

108
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:20,894
out of my way.

109
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,935
Do it, Fran!

110
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:29,298
How could you do it, Fran? 
/ Well, you told me to go for it.

111
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:32,888
Well, I didn't tell you to win.

112
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:39,225
I'm sorry.  My mouth has a mind of
 its own.  There's no stopping it.

113
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:43,742
Never a truer word spoken. All right.
  So what's going on here?

114
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:49,644
I can't believe it.  By tomorrow, everybody
 at school's gonna know that my nanny
 beat me out of the kissing contest.

115
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:56,854
What?  You won the contest? 
/ Well, if you want to call it a contest.

116
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,464
Well, as far as your winning
 this contest is concerned,

117
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:04,545
we'll sort this nonsense out in
 no time. / Nonsense?

118
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,351
Well, Miss Fine, you don't seriously
 think you actually won, do you?

119
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,780
I mean, they were looking for
 a beautiful teenager.

120
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,934
And lovely as you are, you're not
 exactly a teenager, hey?

121
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:22,217
Well, I remember my graduation a lot better
 than some people that I won't spell it out for Y-O-U.

122
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:24,734
Oh, please, Miss Fine, you don't
 seriously expect me to believe

123
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:28,153
you beat out hundreds of young girls
 just because of your kissing prowess?

124
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:32,481
No.  I beat them because
 I happen to be a fabulous kisser.

125
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:36,325
Don't you think you you've gone just 
a little overboard on the hyperbole?

126
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:39,617
I'm wearing "Obsession."

127
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:46,025
Miss Fine, this is insanity.  There's absolutely
 no way you could have won that contest legitimately.

128
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:47,273
Oh, no? / No.

129
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:48,892
Oh, yeah? / Yeah.

130
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,537
Well, you asked for it, buster.

131
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:18,403
I'm sorry I had to get tough
 with you, but you had to learn.

132
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,146
Ah ...

133
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,207
Yes ...

134
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:27,782
Well, um ... right.  Of course.

135
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:30,064
Ah, you know, Miss Fine, I ...

136
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:34,201
I thought I considered every
 possible scenario.

137
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,310
Maggie wins, and I'm miserable. 
 Maggie loses; she's miserable.

138
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,429
But, ah-ha, here's a wild card.  
You win, and we're all miserable.

139
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:50,924
Meanwhile, if you're so miserable, how come 
I know you had clams casino and a side salad for lunch?

140
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:57,386
Decaf cappuccino and 
a bite of cream broulett ...

141
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,700
I thought you were off the sweets.

142
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,819
Miss Fine ...

143
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:07,506
Miss Fine, you have to consider
 my position in this.

144
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:10,321
I -- I have a certain stature 
in the community.

145
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,546
I can't have you kissing someone 
on an album cover.

146
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:16,596
You're my nanny for heaven sakes.
 / Your nanny?

147
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:22,226
Is that what I am to you?
  Your nanny? / Well, yes.

148
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:25,713
All right.  You caught me 
on a technicality.

149
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:29,204
I cannot have the person that's raising 
my children doing something like this.

150
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:33,033
Well, who said I was gonna do it?
 / Well, I thought you just won the contest?

151
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:38,027
Well, what does that have to do with anything?  
Oh, you're such a man sometimes.

152
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:41,880
Don't you realize that your daughter
 has a very low self-esteem.

153
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,415
Something like this could crush her.
 Is that what you want?

154
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:53,195
No.  No.  What I want right now is to be in
 a pub with my hands wrapped around a tall Lager.

155
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:56,594
A logger?

156
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:08,671
Do the kids know that you're
 considering an alternate life-style?

157
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:13,698
It's a beer, Miss Fine. 
/ Oh.  Well, speak English.

158
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:18,453
If you had absolutely no intention of
 going through with this album cover 
in the first place, what are we arguing about?

159
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:23,117
Well, I have no idea. I can't shake
 the image of you picking up Paul Bunyan in a bar.

160
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,616
God ...

161
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,018
it would be easier to have
 them raised by wolves.

162
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,836
Do you think I went overboard 
with this ensemble?

163
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:46,746
No.  You look just like when my Hebrew school
 did "The Best Little Whore House in Texas."

164
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:51,197
This is so exciting.  
I'm gonna meet Billy Ray Cyrus.

165
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:55,303
I wonder if he's related 
to Sugar Ray Leonard?

166
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,798
Oh, he is so gorgeous.
  Take a picture of us.

167
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:02,318
Try and look lifelike.

168
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:10,240
There he is.  There he is.

169
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,591
Oh, he's so hot. 
Look at that body, those eyes.

170
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,806
Hi, Fran. / Hi ...

171
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:18,935
She's perfect, Billy Ray. 
/ Isn't she?

172
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:24,856
Oh, thank you, Mr. Cyrus. 
 Oh, Mr. Cyrus, that sounds funny.

173
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:30,815
Gee, you know, if Emily Bronti married
 you, her name would be Bronti-Cyrus.

174
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:41,921
Anyway, Mr. Cyrus, as flattered as
 I am that you picked me to be your kiss girl,

175
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,715
I can't be on your album cover.

176
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:48,109
You're turning us down? 
/ I'm afraid I have to.

177
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:51,303
You don't want to be in my new video?
 / No.

178
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:56,099
You don't want to be the kiss girl
 on my European tour? / No.

179
00:13:56,099 --> 00:14:00,877
How about a couple tickets to the Grammys.
 There's a party at Streisand's after.

180
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:03,584
What are we really talking about here?

181
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:07,421
The kid is an heiress.  She's got
 tooth picks for thighs. She'll bounce back.

182
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:10,238
Go.  Go.  Go. 
/  No!  No!  No!

183
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:14,418
I'm sorry.  But I can't. 
/ Honey, you gotta do it.

184
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,464
You look great with Billy Ray.

185
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:20,415
Those teenagers made him look 
a little long in the tooth. / What?

186
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,678
Fran, what my ex-manager
 is trying to say is

187
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:27,950
kissing you will appeal
 to a much broader audience.

188
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,784
Yeah.  Older broads.

189
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:34,883
Was I drunk when I hired you?

190
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:38,674
I am not an older broad.  Tell him, Val.

191
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:42,432
Well, you're older than me.
 / Shut up, Val!

192
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:45,191
I'm sorry, but my mind is made up.

193
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:48,129
Darling, this is a great opportunity
for a woman like you.

194
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,609
You just gonna walk on out of
 here with nothing?

195
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:55,039
No.  I am gonna walk out knowing that
 I did not destroy the self-esteem

196
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:02,292
of a very insecure young heiress.
 And that's all I need.

197
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:06,264
Come on, Val. Help me carry
 this on the bus.

198
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:14,605
Oh, how many times have I asked you
 children to close the refrigerator?

199
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,503
What?

200
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:21,759
Miss Fine, I've told you there's 
nothing to be depressed about.

201
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,138
You are a beautiful young woman.  
What are you?  Thirty-two?  Thirty-four?

202
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:28,429
You better be talking about my bra size,

203
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:34,336
or you're gonna become awfully
 chummy with a turkey leg.

204
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:39,829
Fran, I'm sorry I made such a big deal 
about the contest.  Hey, the best woman won.

205
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:46,150
Oh, honey, stop knocking yourself.  
Being the best had nothing to do with it.

206
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:54,000
Being the one most likely to pass a liver spot
 off as a coffee stain is what put me over the top.

207
00:15:54,249 --> 00:16:00,294
Bottom line, you made him look old,
 and I made him look young.

208
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,718
Really?

209
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:05,798
Sweetie, you're too beautiful.
 That's your only curse.

210
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,579
Fran, I love you. / I love you more.

211
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:11,539
Hey, at least Pamela didn't win.

212
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:16,404
I heard some lady at the contest sent
 her on some wild-goose chase.

213
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:20,195
Oh, that's terrible.

214
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:22,912
Gee, did they say if they saw who it was?

215
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:26,842
Oh, no.  The girls just said 
it was some older lady.

216
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:29,526
Fabulous ...

217
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:38,670
Oh, Niles, know what the worst 
part of it all is --

218
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,384
not that in five years my touche is 
going to need training wheels --

219
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:46,271
but that Mr. Sheffield was right.

220
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:50,085
I mean, where do I come off thinking 
I can compete with young girls?

221
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:53,632
Well, it was a little far-fetched.

222
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:56,811
Niles, don't help me.
  I don't need your two cents.

223
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:59,885
Oh, but I will need a twenty.
 That's my pizza.

224
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,832
Miss Fine, we're having dinner in an hour.

225
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:05,737
I know.  Why do you think
 I ordered thin crust?

226
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:08,034
Thank you.  Keep the change.

227
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:11,781
Oh, hi, Miss Babcock.

228
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,991
So, Niles, what's wrong with Nanny Fine?

229
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,610
Oh, come on, Niles, tell me
 or I'll just die.

230
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,690
You say it, but you don't mean it.

231
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,172
Miss Fine won the contest because they 
were looking for an older woman.

232
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:34,940
There. Now, I suppose you'll run and tell
 Mr. Sheffield because somehow in your sick,

233
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,765
twisted mind this will make you
 appear more appealing.

234
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:43,668
Niles, please, that is beneath me.

235
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,620
May I help you?

236
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,946
Nanny Fine's old. / What?

237
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,385
She didn't win the contest cause
 she's a good kisser.

238
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:07,824
She won it because they wanted
 someone really old like her.

239
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:12,516
Old?  Oh, that's preposterous. 
 I mean, what is she?  Twenty-nine?  Thirty?

240
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:17,394
Oh, please, to what power?

241
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,556
I mean, do we really know how old she
 is under all that makeup?  She could be --

242
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:27,169
Your age.

243
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:32,725
That's right.  She could be close to -- 
forget it, Niles.

244
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:35,039
Oh, it is so pathetic.

245
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,324
Nanny Fine thinking she could win a kissing 
contest.  I mean, kissing is an art.

246
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:43,849
It has to be sensuous, deeply felt,

247
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,073
and most of all, it has 
to be spontaneous.

248
00:18:57,317 --> 00:19:01,027
Was it as bad for you as it was for me?

249
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:08,951
Oh, poor Miss Fine. 
 And I was so insensitive to her.

250
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:11,618
Maybe I should go see if she's all right.

251
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,017
No.  No, wait.  Come back.

252
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:28,889
Didn't work out quite as
 you planned, did it?

253
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:32,216
You set me up.  You --

254
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:36,469
the run, the chase, getting 
stuck in the door, everything.

255
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:41,130
My mental health is just 
a sick game to you, isn't it?

256
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,008
Rack 'em up.  Let's play again.

257
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:55,824
Miss Fine? / Oh, um, don't come in. 
 I'm not dressed ...

258
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,377
Come in ...

259
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:07,266
Miss Fine, I do hope you'll 
be coming down to dinner.

260
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:10,366
I can't have my favorite
 nanny wasting away.

261
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:13,782
I don't think I could eat.

262
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:17,703
Do I -- do I smell pizza?

263
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:22,870
No.  No.  That's just Glade's 
new Italian fresh scent.

264
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:26,315
Miss Fine, I -- 
I heard about the contest,

265
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:30,370
and I just can't bear the thought of you 
feeling badly about yourself.

266
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,590
Oh, thank you, Mr. Sheffield. 
 That's awfully sweet of you,

267
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,098
but really, there's nothing you can say or
 do that's gonna make me feel any better.

268
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:40,547
Well, then I suppose 
I'd be wasting my breath

269
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:46,727
if I told you that I think no girl could 
possibly be a match for a woman like you.

270
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:49,572
I'd give it a shot.

271
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:53,235
Why are you Americans so 
obsessed with youth?

272
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:57,030
You know, I prefer the more civilized
 European sensibility that --

273
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,879
that people improve with age, like -- 
like fine wine ...

274
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:05,423
especially a beautiful wine
 that's robust and earthly,

275
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:08,867
yet sweet and strangely compelling.

276
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,595
Oh, you're good.

277
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:16,983
One more thing before 
I stop wasting my breath.

278
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:20,476
I think you are 
one heck of a kisser.

279
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:25,662
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, stop.  Go on.

280
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:28,449
Well, I can't remember 
being kissed like that.

281
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:31,838
As a matter of fact, I don't think
 I've ever been kissed quite like that before.

282
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:36,473
No more.  I'm blushing.  Like what?

283
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:40,638
Well, with such passion.  
Such abandon.  Such ...

284
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:44,702
Such ...
 / Suction.

285
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:52,261
Yeah, well, Danny used to always
 call me his little Dirt Devil.

286
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:55,448
Really?  Isn't that charming.

287
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:58,824
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you are so wonderful.

288
00:21:58,824 --> 00:22:02,791
Here I was eating my heart out,

289
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,881
and then you come up and make me feel
 so much better.  You're such a doll.

290
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:10,646
I could just ...
