1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,642
Maxwell, I cannot tell you how excited I am

2
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,714
about our little weekend getaway to Boston.

3
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:20,251
It's a business trip, C.C.

4
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:22,353
Of course I know that.

5
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:24,789
Work, work, work. In fact,
right now I'm off to get a wax.

6
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:25,890
I mean,

7
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,393
fax.

8
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:33,231
Don't worry, sir. You'll
be right near Salem.

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,867
They know how to take
care of her kind there.

10
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:43,308
Niles, you don't think C.C.
wants to go to Boston to,

11
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,442
you know...

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,477
Shout, "The British are coming?"

13
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:50,916
Oh, no, sir.

14
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:54,352
No. As a matter of fact,
just before you came in,

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,687
she was saying what a shame it is

16
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,656
the children can't go with you.

17
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,490
- Oh, really?
- Hmm.

18
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,260
Well, I suppose it would
be educational for them.

19
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:05,529
Oh, but the hotel only has two rooms.

20
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:07,966
Do you think she would
mind sharing with the girls?

21
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,267
Mind?

22
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:10,869
How many times have we heard her say,

23
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:13,305
"I don't care who I sleep with"?

24
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:18,876
I'm never gonna meet anybody.

25
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:22,847
I'm never gonna fulfill my dream
of buying double burial plots.

26
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:29,553
- That's your dream, Val?
- Mmm-hmm.

27
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:30,989
That's my dream, too.

28
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:35,860
No wonder we're best friends.

29
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,930
Fran? Yeah?

30
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:42,199
You think we're being too particular?

31
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,934
I mean, maybe...

32
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:46,337
maybe we should lower our standards.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,873
Lower our standards?

34
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,442
Val, we're already down to mammal.

35
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,382
All I want is a nice, cute
guy with a couple of bucks.

36
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:04,522
What?

37
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:08,460
Have you ever seen Harold and Maude?

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,067
Oh, forget it.

39
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,269
Once you've seen a guy
in his Batman pajamas,

40
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:20,604
there's just no mystery left.

43
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,927
Oh, Fran, what are we gonna do?

44
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,163
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

45
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:22,300
We're gonna have our own singles party.

46
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,634
We'll charge 20 bucks a head.

47
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:27,105
With all the losers we
know, we'll make a fortune.

48
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,140
You know, I've got just
the perfect place to do it,

49
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,109
the back room of Benny's Clam Bar.

50
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,911
It's so dark and depressing there.

51
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:38,015
Val, how old do I look?

52
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:42,287
I don't know. I can't really tell.

53
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:43,488
Book it, Val.

54
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,191
Daddy, forget it.

55
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,793
Do you know how hard those
concert tickets were to get?

56
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:52,363
There's no way I'm missing Nine Inch Nails.

57
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:55,100
Nine-inch nails? Barbra's on tour again?

58
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:58,503
No, Miss Fine.

59
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,438
Margaret would prefer to go
to a concert with her friends

60
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,374
than spend the weekend in
Boston with her own family.

61
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,343
Oh, well, who wouldn't...

62
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,412
want to go to Boston?

63
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,582
Dad, I'm 16 years old.

64
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,218
I can stay home and take care of myself.

65
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:16,754
Niles will be here to make me stuff, right?

66
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,723
Sweetie, the reason why your father

67
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,224
doesn't want you to stay home alone

68
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,293
is because it makes him feel old.

69
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,295
What?

70
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:27,531
I mean, you know, you're turning
into a responsible young woman,

71
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,867
and that makes him feel
unneeded and useless.

72
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,836
That, the gray patch in his hair,

73
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,671
waking up stiff in the morning...

74
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:36,107
Don't ask. I've never felt better,

75
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,010
and I'm certainly not
afraid of growing old.

76
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:41,312
Margaret, the house is
yours for the weekend.

77
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,249
Oh, thank you, Dad. Fran, you're a goddess.

78
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:48,686
For your information, Miss Fine,

79
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:51,555
when I awaken in the
mornings, nothing is stiff.

80
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:00,331
I rest my case.

81
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:09,040
Oh, wow! Look how many
guys RSVP'd for your party.

82
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,909
- Oh, this one sounds perfect for you.
- Oh?

83
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:14,946
Oh, no, wait. He says he's
looking for a Catholic girl.

84
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,614
Great. He's Jewish.

85
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,959
Niles, would you keep an eye on my bags?

86
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,627
All right.

87
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,936
Just tell me when to stop.

88
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:43,974
Now.

89
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:46,578
Sorry.

90
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:47,845
So am I.

91
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:54,085
Can this day get any better?

92
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:57,388
Oh, I guess it can.

93
00:05:57,455 --> 00:06:01,058
I'll be spending the entire weekend
alone with Maxwell in Boston.

94
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:03,193
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:07,731
But we have some lovely
consolation prizes for you.

96
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:13,804
I am not sitting next
to Gracie on the plane.

97
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,072
She always vomits.

98
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,675
All right. She can sit
next to Miss Babcock.

99
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:24,281
Maxwell, you're bringing
the children on the trip?

100
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,818
Yes, C.C. It was very sweet
of you to think of them.

101
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,053
Niles told me it was all your idea.

102
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,662
Don't thank me.

103
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:44,002
Don't worry. I won't throw up
as long as I don't eat anything.

104
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,371
Well, in case you get peckish,
I packed you a sandwich.

105
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,209
Egg salad.

106
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,946
It'll go lovely with your blazer.

107
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,854
Now remember, I'm trusting
you to behave yourself.

108
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:04,956
No wild parties.

109
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:07,024
- All right, Dad. Goodbye.
- Bye.

110
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:08,325
I'll miss you. I love you.

111
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,327
I love you too.

112
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,129
You know, this is the first...

113
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:17,234
Oh, this is so cool.

114
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,436
I get the whole house to myself.

115
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:22,840
Do whatever I want, whenever I want.

116
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:26,310
Oh, Fran, now I know why you stay single.

117
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:31,782
Yeah, that's it.

118
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,487
Okay. All right.

119
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,856
Oh, Fran, I got horrible news.

120
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:41,559
Oh, my hair guy couldn't
take you this morning?

121
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:42,893
Yes, he did.

122
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:46,597
Isn't he fabulous?

123
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:48,732
Fran, you are not gonna believe this.

124
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,402
Benny's Clam Bar burnt down.

125
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,571
How?

126
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:55,205
A fire!

127
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:03,181
Oh, my God. Oh, now wait a
minute. Don't panic. Don't panic.

128
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:04,582
All we have to do is find a place

129
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,450
that's really classy and free tonight

130
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:09,253
that'll hold 100 guys and seven women.

131
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:12,790
Oh, oh, oh. No, no, no, no.

132
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:16,060
Mr. Sheffield said that we
cannot have parties here.

133
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,330
We're never gonna meet anybody.

134
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:24,768
We're just gonna die alone.

135
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:31,776
Fran, actually Dad said that I
couldn't have any parties tonight.

136
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,520
Well, in my spare time

137
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:45,055
I like to do a little hunting.

138
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:47,091
Oh, well, maybe next time you go

139
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,127
you could bag me a chocolate mousse.

140
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,665
Mooses aren't chocolate.

141
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:55,866
Oh, I know.

142
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,669
I was saying, you know, chocolate "mousse".

143
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:02,006
It's a... have you met my friend Val?

144
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:10,114
Oh, I love the way you move.

145
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,882
And I love the way you look.

146
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,952
Those heels are so sexy.

147
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,753
Oh, thank you.

148
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,689
Mind if I try them on?

149
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:29,333
Have you met my friend Val?

150
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,306
You know, you might not believe this,

151
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:38,876
but this hair, it's all from a can.

152
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:53,523
Really?

153
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,162
Gee, it looks so natural.

154
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:20,484
Have you met my friend Val?

155
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:22,519
Val.

156
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,725
I love your hair.

157
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:34,598
And you hate to hunt.

158
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,067
What do you think of my shoes?

159
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,635
Well, they look great on you.

160
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:38,902
Dip me.

161
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,406
Don't wait up.

162
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,144
You know, Fran, you're pretty
sharp to throw a party like this.

163
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:50,314
Meet great people, you make a few bucks.

164
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:53,384
Hey, a few bucks, please.

165
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,088
I may quit my career as a super model.

166
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:03,494
Well, I think it's amazing
that you show a profit,

167
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:06,897
especially after all those
business licenses you have to buy.

168
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:10,567
What business? It's a party.

169
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,205
Fran...

170
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:16,474
Oh, Jeff.

171
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,944
I don't know how to tell you
this, but I'm a police officer.

172
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,046
And you're under arrest.

173
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,283
That was a pistol?

174
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:42,966
Somebody's gonna have a
hell of a mess to clean up.

175
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,603
Damn, it's me.

176
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,841
Well, thanks for taking me home

177
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:55,079
and for letting me play with your siren.

178
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:58,816
My pleasure. Oh, can I have my handcuffs?

179
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:03,654
Thank you.

180
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,625
Handcuffs, Miss Fine?

181
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:11,662
He was a cop. I got arrested last night.

182
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:13,230
Really?

183
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:14,698
I was a pirate.

184
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,470
I had to walk the plank.

185
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,439
I'm serious. It was horrible.

186
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:25,209
I spent the night in jail.

187
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:28,245
Of course, I did meet a lovely
girl named Sparkle Plenty.

188
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:31,115
She charges 20 bucks to
come to her party, too.

189
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,250
Well, why didn't you call?

190
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:34,418
Well, I did.

191
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:37,688
I guess somebody was too
busy shivering his timber.

192
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,858
Oh, my God.

193
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:43,960
I spend the night over at Whitney's house,

194
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:46,163
and you guys completely trash the place?

195
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:47,998
I miss everything.

196
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,901
Oh, help me to clean up
before my father gets home.

197
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,803
I mean, your father.

198
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:55,506
Oh, thank God he's not
coming back until tomorrow.

199
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:58,275
Could you imagine the look on his
face if he got a load of this...

200
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:01,045
Oh, oh, oh. We've been robbed.

201
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,513
Can you imagine what kind of an animal

202
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,847
would do something like this...

203
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,749
Save it, Miss Fine.

204
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:08,485
Grace got sick, so we
took an earlier flight.

205
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:11,822
Niles, could you do something
with Miss Babcock's blazer?

206
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,424
Certainly, sir.

207
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,465
I specifically said no parties.

208
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:22,766
Mr. Sheffield, let me explain.

209
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,302
I am very disappointed in you, Margaret.

210
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,004
- Margaret?
- Margaret?

211
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,906
Oh, no, Mr. Sheffield. This was my party.

212
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:32,176
Oh, nice try, Miss Fine.

213
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,778
But even the woman who put a bumper sticker

214
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:36,279
on my limo reading "Honk if you're a hunk"

215
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:37,547
wouldn't be stupid enough

216
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,249
to throw a party in my absence.

217
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,919
Hey, hey, don't make a
rush to judgment here.

218
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,388
You're dealing with one dumb gal.

219
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:48,392
Your devotion to the children
is touching, Miss Fine,

220
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,227
but don't be ridiculous.

221
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:52,362
If I thought for one moment you
were responsible for all this,

222
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,030
I'd have to fire you.

223
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:56,400
Fire me?

224
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,937
Fran, stop trying to cover for me.

225
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:02,873
Dad, I had the party when
Fran went out last night.

226
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:04,407
She had nothing to do with this.

227
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,343
- Maggie.
- Fran.

228
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,511
I did it.

229
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:09,179
No, I did this.

230
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:10,914
Oh, and I suppose you're the one

231
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,316
that spilled the bottle of cream rinse

232
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,017
on the Persian rug?

233
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,386
No.

234
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,222
Oh, it must have been Niles.

235
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:20,724
Well, I certainly hope it
was worth it, young lady.

236
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,193
You're grounded indefinitely.

237
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,496
Dad, the Nine Inch
Nails concert is tonight.

238
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,264
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, wait.

239
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,200
End of discussion, Miss Fine.

240
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,570
Maggie, are you out of your mind?

241
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:36,006
Fran, I didn't want you to get fired.

242
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,442
I care more about you
than I do any concert.

243
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:41,245
Oh, I love you.

244
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,747
And I kind of forgot it was tonight.

245
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,718
Oh, Niles, can you believe what a mensch

246
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:50,921
that kid turned out to be?

247
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:53,957
Hmm?

248
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,559
Oh, I'm not gonna let her

249
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,894
miss that concert to save my butt.

250
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:59,496
I don't care if he does fire me.

251
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:02,232
Oh, meanwhile, that bumper sticker

252
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,534
wasn't the stupidest thing I ever did.

253
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:12,476
Miss Fine, what on earth possessed you?

254
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:15,679
I specifically said no parties.

255
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:19,183
Well, technically, you
told Maggie no parties.

256
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,552
Don't you start with the semantics.

257
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:25,322
Oh, so now you're gonna fire
me because you're anti-semantic?

258
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,591
- Miss Fine.
- Oh, all right.

259
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,226
But before you do anything rash,

260
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:31,262
just remember I'm a fabulous nanny

261
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,364
and a wonderful influence on the children.

262
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,798
Oh, I gotta go.

263
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,334
If a hooker named Sparkles
calls, tell her that I'm in court.

264
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:40,471
Do you think this is cute
enough for an arraignment? No?

265
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,576
Niles, I'm beginning to think that hiring

266
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:47,978
a door-to-door cosmetics salesgirl

267
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:50,914
as a nanny was not my finest hour.

268
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,884
Although your skin has
never looked more supple.

269
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,256
Niles, this is the woman
who's raising my children.

270
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:01,025
Yes, and look what she's done to them.

271
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,359
Miss Grace's therapist

272
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,828
is no longer on the speed dial.

273
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,465
Master Brighton has given up
those insipid little blazers

274
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:10,134
with the nautical emblems and the gold...

275
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:17,674
which look so good on you, sir.

276
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:21,344
Niles, Margaret is at a very
impressionable age right now,

277
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:23,914
and Miss Fine's behavior is
hardly character-building.

278
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,582
That was certainly proven today.

279
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,384
What 16-year-old
in her right mind

280
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:30,988
would give up the concert
of her life to save a friend?

281
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:35,859
Niles, if I show Miss Fine leniency now,

282
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:37,460
I'll have someone working for me

283
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,930
who has absolutely no
respect for my authority

284
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,199
and never listens to a word I say.

285
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,074
Right?

286
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:54,278
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I checked
out after I made my point.

287
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:03,320
The State v. Fran Fine.

288
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:04,988
Yes?

289
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,590
Miss Fine?

290
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:07,691
Yes?

291
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,093
Do you have your attorney present?

292
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:13,196
Oh, my attorney present.

293
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:15,832
Oh, oh, you know what?

294
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,001
I'm not gonna get him anything.

295
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,739
Let's see how he does first.

296
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:31,014
Is this a competency hearing?

297
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:35,985
Meanwhile, what's the
use in having a lawyer

298
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,254
for an uncle if he's a no-show?

299
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,690
Well, is he any good?

300
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,792
Well, he worked for some
pretty good law firms.

301
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:45,529
I mean, Freeburg, Freeman,
and free for the family.

302
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,731
- He's strictly pro bono.
- Really?

303
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,633
Well, I'm glad he's not representing me

304
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,234
because I'm pro-Cher.

305
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:56,607
Hold it. Hold it.

306
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,876
Will you hold it?

307
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:04,315
I... I object. I object.

308
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:06,150
You object to what?

309
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:08,685
To those electric doors in the men's room.

310
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,222
That's the elevator.

311
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:18,661
Use the stairs.

312
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,667
Can we get on with this, please?

313
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:27,371
Yes, Your Honor. My client
has been unjustly accused,

314
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,206
and I say that...

315
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:31,508
Which one is my client?

316
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:33,377
Oh, it's me. It's me, Uncle Manny.

317
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,312
Fran, Yetta's granddaughter.

318
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,515
Oh, Yetta's granddaughter.

319
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,552
Who's Yetta?

320
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,421
I'm your great-niece. I
spoke to you last night.

321
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:46,890
I'm Sylvia Fine's daughter.

322
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:48,592
Oh, yeah.

323
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,894
The one that's not married.

324
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:52,663
That you remember?

325
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,500
So, Your Honor, what...
what are the charges?

326
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,202
Conducting business in a
residential neighborhood

327
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,939
without a franchise tax license,

328
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:04,107
a city business license

329
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:05,975
or a liquor license.

330
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:08,245
Wow.

331
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,882
You're gonna need a lawyer.

332
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,051
You're a lawyer.

333
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,521
Then you're in luck.

334
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,592
Sweetheart, isn't that skirt a little snug?

335
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,727
Well, maybe just a little.

336
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:26,229
You hear that, Your Honor?

337
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,365
The skirt is snug.

338
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,002
So if it doesn't fit, you must acquit.

339
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:48,218
That's my defense? Oh, I'm going to jail.

340
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:51,287
Do I get conjugal visits?

341
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,856
Sure.

342
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:55,091
All right, put me down for six years.

343
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:59,062
What... what am I saying?

344
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,164
Uncle Manny, do something.

345
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:09,272
I'm sorry, Your Honor, I
think the defense is resting.

346
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:14,912
Miss Fine, would you just like to plead?

347
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,679
Yes, I would.

348
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:20,250
Oh, please, please, don't send me to jail.

349
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:23,920
Your... Your Honor, permission
to approach the bench?

350
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:26,023
Come on down.

351
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,625
Mr. Sheffield, what are you doing here?

352
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,827
Your Honor, this... this woman works for me.

353
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:33,297
The... the party was held in my home.

354
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:37,668
And, well, I have never known
her to knowingly break the law,

355
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,937
well, except for
free pay-per-view,

356
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:42,873
but then everyone schmears the cable man.

357
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:46,510
Right?

358
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:49,979
Why don't you just go sit down
with the rest of the dream team?

359
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,717
Mr. Sheffield,

360
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,721
the party was in your house?

361
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,293
Then you are responsible for the party.

362
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:06,763
I am fining you $500.

363
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,301
And you are free to go.

364
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:14,004
And thank God, so am I.

365
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,839
Thank you, thank you.

366
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:18,208
I can tell you one thing,
I'm not paying that fine.

367
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:21,478
Oh, you're gonna fight
the system. What a turn-on.

368
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:22,980
Nope. You're paying it.

369
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:24,881
What a turnoff.

370
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:26,850
It's coming out of your salary.

371
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,418
Oh, my salary.

372
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:31,187
So does that mean you're not gonna fire me?

373
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:35,125
No. But since you acted like a
bloody teenager, you're grounded.

374
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:36,760
Grounded?

375
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,895
You know, I'm a grown woman.

376
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,164
Why don't you just put me
over your knee and spank me?

377
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:44,367
Oh, what do you know, we
made it back to turn-on.

378
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:51,408
Don't move, I'm coming
back with a surprise.

379
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,582
Sweetheart, you look
fabulous in that dress.

380
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,883
Oh, thank you.

381
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:04,621
Can I try it on?

382
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:24,508
