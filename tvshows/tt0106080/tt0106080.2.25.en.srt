1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,760
Ma, how could you be going
 through a midlife crisis?

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,372
What are you going to do? 
 Live to a hundred and thirty?

3
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:13,427
Enough already with getting a job.

4
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:16,356
Ma, the bakery didn't fire
 you because you were a woman,

5
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:19,784
they fired you because
 you ate like a pig.

6
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:25,785
Now she's insulted.

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,791
Maggie, don't forget, you have an appointment
 with Mr. Anthony at the Chatterbox

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,827
to get your hair done this afternoon. 
/ Oh, is he really good?

9
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:37,607
All the girls at Haley's sweet sixteen
 are just gonna hate your guts.

10
00:00:37,607 --> 00:00:39,678
I love you, Fran.

11
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:44,813
Oh, really, Miss Fine, is a sweet sixteen party
 just about making your friends hate your guts?

12
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:46,605
Yes!

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,786
Hello, hello.

14
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:53,332
Cee Cee, tell me, did you have
 one of these sweet sixteens?

15
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:57,881
Oh, please, all those little snot 
noses trying to outdo each other.

16
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,993
I didn't want one.

17
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,655
No friends?
 / None.

18
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:12,278
Niles, my eggs are all dried up.
 / The gene pool is saved.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,972
Oh, well, fasten your seat belts, kids. 
 We're about to enter the silicone valley.

21
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:19,735
What are all these women doing here?
 / Your father's holding auditions.

22
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:23,031
I told him not to cast
 this role until after school.

23
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:27,400
Oh, if they've danced already,
 there's going to be hell to pay.

24
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:31,451
Come on, Maggie, we gotta go to
 the Chatterbox to get your hair done.

25
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,697
Oh, um, let me just go change out of 
my uniform. / Oh, all right, but hurry up

26
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:37,704
because nobody has ever kept
 Mr. Anthony waiting,

27
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:41,414
except Susan Powter. 
Need I say more?

28
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:45,872
Excuse me?  Can you break a twenty?  
The cab driver's holding on to it until I can get --

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,265
change.

30
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:52,891
Well, it doesn't matter. 
 This part is mine. / Oh ...

31
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:57,482
Blue is my lucky color.  Look, 
the entire house is done in blue.

32
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:00,315
Honey, honey ...

33
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,866
Bummer.

34
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:09,319
Well, it still doesn't matter.  
What do they have that I don't have?

35
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,961
These are prescription, right?

36
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:16,691
Are you here for the tall,
 voluptuous show girl, 18 to 25?

37
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,243
Oh, your eyes are fine.

38
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:23,480
No, I'm not auditioning. 
/ So you must be one of the producers.

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,891
Better.  The nanny.

40
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:28,959
Let me look at your resume. 
Maybe I can give you a few pointers.

41
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,282
Um, Mary Ruth, well, that's gotta go.

42
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:35,778
You need more experience. 
/ I don't have any.

43
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:41,285
Well, I'll take care of that cause, you know, 
Mr. Sheffield only hires the most accomplished actresss.

44
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:44,693
Now, is "Baywatch" one word or two?

45
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:49,241
Hau -- oh, my stomach
 is in knots -- hau.

46
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,890
My acting teacher always says 
when you get really nervous -- hau --

47
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,815
just imagine all the people you're
 auditioning for naked.

48
00:03:56,074 --> 00:04:01,428
Well, picture her because I've seen him. 
 And trust me, that's not gonna calm you down.

49
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:05,144
Thank you, babe.

50
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:09,570
Shall a leave a picture? 
/ Ha, ha, ha.

51
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:15,619
Wow!  That went so much better 
than my last audition.

52
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,408
Honey, how much are you paying this acting teacher?

53
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:24,580
Nothing.  We were living together until 
he threw me out for an actress with more talent.

54
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:28,096
So now I have no place to live, no job,

55
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:31,811
nowhere to go, and no means of support. 
But I can't complain.

56
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:35,179
You're not Jewish, are you?

57
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:42,579
Listen, I'm on my way to the Chatterbox salon,
 and someone told me that they need a new shampoo girl.

58
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,323
Well, that sounds perfect.

59
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:45,607
Let me see your resume

60
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:50,269
cause, you know, Mr. Anthony only 
hires people from the most exclusive salons.

61
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,651
Now is Super Cuts one word or two?

62
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:06,688
Chatterbox, Claude speaking.

63
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:12,056
What do you mean she's canceling 
her four o'clock with Mr. Anthony?

64
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:16,375
You can't cancel with Mr. Anthony 
without a 48-hour notice.

65
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,411
Well, when did she die?

66
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,069
Hello?

67
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:29,253
What's new, pussycat? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Rauuu!

68
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:35,196
What's new, pussycat? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

69
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:39,868
Come over here.

70
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:47,046
I'm very satisfied.

71
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:52,469
Ma, what do you think you're doing?

72
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,582
It's my turn to tip.

73
00:05:56,415 --> 00:06:01,576
Don't worry, Sylvia. 
 I still got plenty of room on this side.

74
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,209
Oh, Mr. Anthony, I'm a married woman.

75
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,463
Come here.

76
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:15,268
Like a ripe cantelope.

77
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:20,757
You bruise it, you bought it.

78
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:29,390
Now, remember what I told you.  
When I introduce you to
 Mr. Anthony, picture him naked.

79
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,693
But I'm not nervous. / So what?

80
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:39,304
Mr. Anthony, your 3:30 is here. 
/ Hey, Franny, ohhh,

81
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:43,801
look at that body, look at that shape.
 / Oh, Mr. Anthony ...

82
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:47,171
No one conditions like you.

83
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:50,629
Thanks.  This is Maggie.
 / Hi.

84
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:53,009
She's invited to her first 
sweet sixteen party.

85
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:56,666
Oh, you're sixteen; you're beautiful,

86
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,030
and you're mine.

87
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:03,515
I made that up.

88
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:09,076
So would you like to slip into 
something a little more comfortable?

89
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:11,214
Okay.

90
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:14,757
Claude will get you a smock.

91
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:18,468
You know, Claude has styled 
a lot of celebrities.

92
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,179
He's the one that told
 Jerry Lewis more oil.

93
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:26,569
Oh, a natural blond. 
 Well, now there's two of us.

94
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:29,323
Honey, honey, come here, come here.

95
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,699
Oh, Mr. Anthony, this is Mary Ruth,
 your new shampoo girl.

96
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:37,439
Oh, not so fast.  I just don't 
hire anyone off the street.

97
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,547
Let me see your resume.

98
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,462
Oh, Super Cuts.

99
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,416
What -- what are you staring at?

100
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,487
Nothing.  I was just picture you nake --

101
00:07:54,985 --> 00:08:01,540
before we start, I think it's only fair
 to warn you that I am first 
and foremost an actress.

102
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,002
And at any moment, I may get
 a lead on Broadway,

103
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:09,077
or Merv Griffin could call and want
 a game show hostess, and it could
 all happen so quickly.

104
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:10,826
In show business, 
they needed you yesterday.

105
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:15,884
Do you sweep? / Yes.
 /You're hired./ Bless you, Mr. Anthony.

106
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:23,876
You know, Yetta, Maggie is going to 
a sweet sixteen at the Statue of Liberty.

107
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:28,666
Big deal, I had mine on Ellis Island.

108
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:33,028
So many people came.

109
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,607
Yetta, you were in quarantine.

110
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,316
I thought it went on a little long.

111
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:44,171
Okay, Sylvia.  You're all done.

112
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:46,158
Thank you, Kim.

113
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:50,061
Ah, how long should
 I wait before I eat?

114
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:53,056
Oh, about four years.

115
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:01,584
I tell you, I'm going to
 love working here.

116
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:05,870
What do you mean? / I took a really 
good interview with Mr. Anthony.

117
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,738
Oh, you're the one that told me 
Mr. Anthony was looking for a new shampoo girl.

118
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:14,988
Yeah.  Why? 
/ Nothing.

119
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:21,412
I am practically a shoe in.  The only
 other person who applied is Estelle ...

120
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:32,104
But he wants somebody young.

121
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,801
You know, Ma, I don't think 
it's such a good idea

122
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:39,746
you working here and handling
 all those permanent wave fumes.

123
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:45,862
Oh, I love them fumes.  
Gives me a nice buzz.

124
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,626
Besides, Ma, daddy doesn't want you 
to work.  Who's going to feed him lunch?

125
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:56,868
What?  He can't add water to
 the Top Ramen himself?

126
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,563
Yeah.  But if you're not there to stop
 him, he's just gonna keep eating.

127
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:06,084
Remember Uncle Aaron --may he rest
 in peace -- he exploded that Chanukah.

128
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:08,518
The doctor said it was a freak occurrence. 
/ Yeah.

129
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:14,564
You can't eat 32 latkas and sit 
that close to a menorah.

130
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:23,812
Meanwhile, where was Aunt Polly?

131
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:26,305
At work. 
/ Ohhhh ...

132
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:29,514
Oh, you're right.  
I'm being selfish.

133
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:33,227
I have to sacrifice
 my career for my man.

134
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:37,360
Oh, Ma, you're doing the right thing.

135
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,041
Thank you, Fran.
  I got the job with Mr. Anthony.

136
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,887
Ow!  Ma, stop pinching me.

137
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,759
This is my best nail I ever paint.

138
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,117
This is my country.

139
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,355
That's my sister.

140
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:04,134
That's her husband.

141
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:08,312
And that's the cat.

142
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:13,528
It's amazing you can paint with so much detail. 
/ Meanwhile, I'm going blind.

143
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:15,905
Ahhhhhh!
 / What was that?

144
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:19,155
Calm down.  Just bikini wax.

145
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,521
Might as well face it,
 you're addicted to love.

146
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:34,555
Your heart sweats, oh, your body shakes.

147
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:36,071
Yeah. You're mine.

148
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:39,566
Meanwhile, what you staring at? 
 Like I don't know.

149
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:44,269
Please, he's not my type.  I don't go
 for that dark wavy hair, blue eyes --

150
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:49,365
what is that -- a 30-inch waist? 
/ 29, long.

151
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:57,454
So, how was your first day?
 / Long -- hard -- good.  Bye.

152
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:03,911
Did you sweep?
 / Yes.

153
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:07,513
Good.  Then, you can go home. 
/ Great.

154
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,889
Do you know a nice hotel around
 here or maybe a shelter?

155
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:17,700
I don't really know Queens. 
/ Well, now you know one.  Charmed.

156
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,496
Well, ah, I'll tell you what.  
Until you get back on your feet, 
you can stay in the back room.

157
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:30,295
It's not really fit for a human being. 
 Oh, and when my mother comes, you've gotta get out.

158
00:12:30,295 --> 00:12:35,996
Thank you, Mr. Anthony.  Kim, he's so sweet.  
He's letting me stay in the back room.

159
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:42,190
Oh, good.  It was going to be employee lounge,
 but this much better, you deserve it.

160
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:49,819
Oh, yeah?  Well, come over
 here and say that.

161
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:53,988
Geez, it was just an expression.

162
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,588
Come meet new shampoo girl, Mary Ruth.

163
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:59,621
Mary Ruth, this is
 Mr. Anthony's son Mimo.

164
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,470
I didn't know Mr. Anthony had a son.

165
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,017
Sure.  This is Mimo's class picture.

166
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:09,469
Only one without a tie.

167
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:14,179
Ah, excuse me. 
 I couldn't help but notice,

168
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:17,275
you have a little blood gushing 
out of the side of your head.

169
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:21,984
Look, lady, I'm 13, I live in New York, 
and my father owns a beauty parlor.

170
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:25,690
This is not an uncommon thing.

171
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,866
You poor kid.
 / Lady, I'm all right, really.

172
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:30,837
Well, let me take care of
 that for you. / Okay.

173
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:35,439
You know, the head bleeds the most. 
 It's something about the capillaries 
being close to the --

174
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:39,153
oh, I'm getting a little queasy. 
 I'm not that good with blood.

175
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,014
Mimo -- / Huh?

176
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:44,035
Swear you won't let my dress
 fall over my head.

177
00:13:45,286 --> 00:13:50,592
Well, she fits in perfectly.
  Another fruit loop for the bowl.

178
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:55,822
Mimo, who were you fighting with? 
 Was it that Glen Chamoff bully again?

179
00:13:55,822 --> 00:14:00,526
I have a good mind to teach that boy
 a lesson if he wasn't so big for his age.

180
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:05,299
Hey, you be nice.  His mother
 good customer, nice lady. I see her tomorrow.

181
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:08,971
I'll give her fungus.

182
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,953
There's gotta be a Band-Aid
 around here somewhere.

183
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:14,750
Oh, no, no, no, just stay out of there. 
 It's private.  Okay?  Just stay out of there.

184
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,448
I'm not interested in anything in
 this drawer except for a Band-Aid.

185
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:21,485
Oh, what's this?
 / Give me that.

186
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,918
Okay.  I'm sorry. 
 I'll mind my own business.

187
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:27,649
That's Mimo's mother.
 / Really?

188
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:33,289
She's very pretty.  Someone should
 --should fix the glass and put her out.

189
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:39,165
Oh, please, that will happen the day 
the NFL asks me to play tight end.

190
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:43,671
She break Mr. Anthony's heart. And when
 she left him, he punched out the glass.

191
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:47,414
Oh, not to mention the mailbox, the dumpster.
 / Sister Mary Margaret.

192
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:52,093
Well, that was an accident. 
/ Oh, boy, she went down like
 a ton of bricks.

193
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:57,196
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone ...
 / Bah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

194
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:01,841
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone ...
 / Bah, bah, bah, bah.

195
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:05,725
When I see you, I could do -- wait --

196
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:11,006
where'd you get that?
 / Out of the drawer.

197
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:15,367
Mimo? / Hey, it's a junk drawer. 
 I don't know how it got in there.

198
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:16,953
Mimo?

199
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:22,765
Hey, this isn't "Les Miserables." 
Get back to work.

200
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:27,638
You know, it's so obvious what's going on here. 
/ Yeah.  You're about to get fired.

201
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:32,742
No, no, no, no, no.  All these years that 
you have been hating her, he has been missing her.

202
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:36,877
I'm guessing you're one of those girls that's
 got a real urge to reach out to people?

203
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:43,129
Yep. / Fight that. Now, let's put
 this back where it belongs.

204
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:54,650
I should have hired Sylvia. I would have
 gotten a little peace and quiet around here.

205
00:15:54,861 --> 00:16:01,190
My own daughter betrayed me.  
Now I know how Nancy Reagan felt.

206
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:07,276
Ma, I'm sorry.  What can 
I do to make it up to you?

207
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:10,139
Marry Mr. Sheffield.

208
00:16:10,688 --> 00:16:15,932
Ma, you're insane.  It's a good thing 
I take after grandma Yetta. Oy!

209
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:22,514
I have no career.  All my life I've been 
somebody's daughter, somebody's wife, somebody's mother.

210
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,721
Who the hell am I?

211
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:29,632
Miss Fine! 
/ Next.

212
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:32,282
I was strolling along Lexington 
Avenue with my lawyer

213
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:36,204
when he nudges me to check out the -- 
and I quote -- "hot brunette."

214
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,950
Oh, that's impossible. 
 I was on Fifth.

215
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:45,724
Not you, Miss Fine.  My 15-year-old daughter's
 wearing a wig that makes her look 25.

216
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:48,709
25?  Cool.

217
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,845
Hey, do I look old enough
 to get into a club?

218
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:53,847
Sure.  And we haven't even
 put the lashes on yet.

219
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,672
Which we are not going to do because 
you're just a little girl.

220
00:16:56,672 --> 00:17:01,421
Now, get upstairs and make your daddy 
a cupcake in your Easy Bake oven.

221
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:04,763
Miss Fine, whatever possessed you?

222
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:07,601
Well, every girl should experiment
 with her look.

223
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:12,009
When I was her age, I dyed my hair
 red just like Ruda Lenska.

224
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:17,813
Oh, within two days I was -- oh, 
that wig is definitely going back.

225
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:21,656
Don't you worry. They'll give us
 a full refund at the Chatterbox.

226
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:24,106
I'm like family there.

227
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,948
Fran who?

228
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:30,303
Nope.  No returns.  No refunds.

229
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:33,950
Sorry, dear, tears don't work on me.

230
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,644
Neither does that.

231
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:40,797
Well, that might work 
if I close my eyes.

232
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:44,041
Hey, watch it, you're drowning me.

233
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,535
You never washed someone else's hair before? 
/ Actually, this was my first time.

234
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:50,186
Oh, then you're pretty good.

235
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:56,129
Hey, Claude, give me some big hair.
 I got my nephew's bar mitzvah tomorrow.

236
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:58,717
I really want to pop.

237
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:01,416
You're Jewish? 
/ Nope.  I married one.

238
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:05,760
They make good husband.  No cheat,
 no drink, and every Sunday night,

239
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,755
he in the mood for Chinese.

240
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:13,500
Look what I did for Mimo.

241
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,058
Oh, you take picture of mother 
out of garbage and fix it.

242
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:20,119
Very good.

243
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,296
We got employee lounge back.

244
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:27,231
Poor, Mr. Anthony, all that anger
 is just because he's lonely.

245
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:32,468
Sure he tries to hide it. 
/ Oh, yes.  Tonight he's hiding it with Bernice.

246
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:36,331
He's seeing someone?  
Well, you know what they say.

247
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:41,184
All the good ones are either 
married or seeing someone or ...

248
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:46,554
I think it's just those 
two things they say.

249
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,850
So what's she like?
 / Who?  Bernice?

250
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,141
Oh, she very smart girl, two brains.

251
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,841
See, now that is classic.

252
00:18:56,841 --> 00:19:00,697
He's avoiding a serious relationship 
because he doesn't want to get hurt again.

253
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:03,893
I wonder how much a pair of brains
 like that cost?

254
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,727
My darling, if you want to work here,
 let me give you a little advice.

255
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:09,106
Stay out of Mr. Anthony's private life.

256
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:14,358
Look, I am not afraid of Mr. Anthony. 
 He has got to start putting 
his son's needs ahead of his own.

257
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:18,972
And I will tell him that right to
 his face. / What's that?

258
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:24,362
Pier One is having a two for one frame sale. 
 And I thought Mimo would like 
the frame of equal or lesser value.

259
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:29,796
You know, when you alphabetized
 my styling mousses, I said,

260
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:32,635
all right; she's eager.

261
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:38,833
When you convinced Mrs. Wilk to cut her hair
 short so she wouldn't have to come back for six months,

262
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:42,009
I said, all right, she's stupid.

263
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:46,538
But when you interfere in my personal
 life against direct orders,

264
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:49,719
I say, all right, she's fired!

265
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:56,056
You know, when a guy punches out
 a picture of his wife,
 I say all right, he's in pain.

266
00:19:56,056 --> 00:20:00,478
When he throws that picture into the trash,
 I say, all right, he's in denial.

267
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:05,118
But when he fires the one person who is just
 trying to bring him and his son closer together,

268
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:11,167
I say, please don't fire me, Mr. Anthony.

269
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:15,214
How many times do I have to tell you? 
 Nobody wants this picture.

270
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,969
I do.

271
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:19,551
See.  I told you.

272
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:23,878
And close.
  This is none of your business.

273
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:29,104
And if you're gonna pretend to cut her hair
 over there would you at least 
put some scissors in your hand.

274
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,339
Mimo, what do you need this picture for?

275
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:38,285
I don't know.  I -- well, just 
in case she ever came back,

276
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:40,899
I guess I'd know what she looked like.

277
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:43,253
Well, then you should keep 
it because she's your mother.

278
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:46,518
Do you mind?  I know how to talk to my kid.

279
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:51,499
Then you should keep it because
 she was your mother.

280
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:59,650
And just for the record, ah,
 she walked out on me, not you.

281
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:02,733
Ohhh!

282
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,170
Oh, this is a real Kodak moment.

283
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,252
Okay, smile.

284
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:23,974
There, now you look like
 my little girl again.

285
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:28,604
I'm not going.  No guys will be
 the least bit interested in me.

286
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:31,900
Good.  Then you'll have
 no problem being home by 10:00.

287
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:38,987
Come on, Margaret, no boy in his right mind would
 be the least bit attracted to that ridiculous wig ...

288
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:45,193
Oh, Miss Fine, look at you.

289
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:48,387
Well, they wouldn't take it back, 
and I didn't want it to go to waste.

290
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:50,629
Are you sure you don't want
 to go out for ice cream?

291
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:53,900
Huh?  Who said that?  Oh, Niles, 
we're going out for ice cream.

292
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,457
Oh, I thought you were exhausted, sir.

293
00:21:55,457 --> 00:22:00,078
I drew you a bath in the Jacuzzi with 
eucalyptus oil and a snifter of brandy.

294
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:04,397
Well, I've got a second wind. 
 I'll go hail a cab.

295
00:22:04,843 --> 00:22:08,749
Well, wouldn't want it to go to waste.

296
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:14,656
Well, can you believe that he's going. 
 Two minutes ago, he was dead to the world.

297
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:17,728
One look at this wig and
 he's ready for a double dip.

298
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:21,629
I tell you, I don't know 
whether to be flattered or insulted.

299
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:25,134
Look, what do you say 
we take in a movie as well?

300
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,846
Flattered it is.
