- Put me down.
- Why?

Because I don't like

It should be menostopped,
not menopaused.

calling it an affair?

00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,141
I don't have a plan here. This
is an impossible situation.

157
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,560
You should just call her.

158
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,689
You're right.

159
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,442
[Sam Sighs Heavily]

160
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,961
- Oh, my God!
- Froshy, look at you!

161
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,798
You're shrinking! You're like the
incredible shrinking Froshy!

162
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,676
You look so glamorous for
a Tuesday afternoon.

163
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,386
Oh, I love you! Come on.

164
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,931
You know who I'm gonna
go see tomorrow? Felix.

165
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,143
As in Max's boyfriend, Felix?

166
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,228
Professionally, like fertility wise?

167
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,438
Yeah.

168
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,065
You guys are trying to have a kid?

169
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,943
Well, we're trying. It's not
getting us anywhere, so...

170
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,361
it's time for science.

171
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,445
Yay!

172
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,456
Whoa.

173
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:54,492
Ethan with a kid, it's...
hard to imagine.

174
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,953
I know, I think it's hard
for him to imagine, too.

175
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,791
Gosh, this bed is so comfortable, I
could just fall asleep right here.

176
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,501
I am...

177
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,671
I am so optimistic for you guys

178
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,924
and just feeling so
positive about this.

179
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,803
I know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to buy you this bed.

180
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,805
What? Weird.

181
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,058
- Yeah. Happy housewarming.
- Wait.

182
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,518
No, Sam, that is insane.

183
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,188
- We don't have an apartment yet.
- Too late, bed bought.

184
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,981
Congratulations on your new bed.

185
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,026
Also, let me and Jon take you
guys out for dinner tonight.

186
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,029
This is so fun! It's awesome
to have you guys here!

187
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,572
Raoul!

188
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,493
[Max] So, first of all,
I just have to tell you

189
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,204
that I absolutely loved

190
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,122
the first 60 pages of Before the Storm.

191
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,583
- Max, thank you so much.
- Loved it.

192
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,919
It's my first stab at a
more mainstream thing.

193
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,214
I know I'm very fortunate and
blessed, the critics love my books.

194
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,424
I just want someone to read them.

195
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,134
Because we need the money.

196
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,970
Well, anyway... I hope
it wasn't too corny.

197
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,765
- No! It was the opposite of corny.
- Great, okay.

198
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,268
The idea of exploring race and class
through a biracial 18-year-old

199
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:06,189
just months before Hurricane Katrina,
but without the drama of the hurricane.

200
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,067
- Right!
- It was so you, man, it was so...

201
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,069
It was... so you.

202
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,488
Thank you so much, Max.
So what happens next?

203
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,615
I think we're at the end of the road.

204
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,408
What?

205
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,245
I think this book is no more.
You should stop writing it.

206
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,958
I'm sorry, what kind of sales strategy
is that? Storm is my best seller!

207
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,794
That is not the opinion
of the rest of the team.

208
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,631
Well, why don't you share with me
what the rest of the team has to say?

209
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,551
I'm more than open to a little
constructive criticism.

210
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,386
Sometimes you get a little...

211
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,388
[In Goofy Voice] Would
you share your thoughts?

212
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,807
I love to hear the thoughts.

213
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,268
You do the voices when
you're uncomfortable.

214
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,812
Let me explain, sometimes
workshopping books,

215
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,690
everybody gets on top of each
other, it's not a problem.

216
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,694
- I'm getting the opposite feeling.
- Not a problem.

217
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,156
- That it's a huge problem.
- I love to hear the thoughts, though.

218
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,242
- Well... I've got them here.
- [In Normal Voice] Yeah.

219
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,482
Okay, Donna, who was
in a terrible mood,

220
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,663
by the way, she's going
through a divorce.

221
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,540
- Please.
- She said really boring.

222
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,334
- She said really boring?
- She underlined "really."

223
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,920
- Makes sense she's getting divorced.
- True.

224
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,481
[Goofy Voice] Keep thoughts a-coming!

225
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,050
Alright. Patel is next up.
He thought it was...

226
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,637
not entertaining... at all.

227
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,140
"I hate this book so much."

228
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:27,395
And he put, like, four "O"s. "Soooo
much." "I hate this book," he said.

229
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:31,774
But don't worry about any of this shit.
I have the answer to all your problems.

230
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:32,984
I got it.

231
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,569
I'm ready.

232
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,028
Two letters.

233
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,197
Y...

234
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,532
A.

235
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,243
Young Adult.

236
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,495
- I don't think that's for me.
- I don't know.

237
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,206
I do know because I write
literary fiction for adults.

238
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,495
Yes, I know, and you've
won awards for it.

239
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,178
The Pen/Hemingway and
the Pushcart Prize.

240
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,604
Yes, I did.

241
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,007
You won a ton of shit
no one's ever heard of.

242
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:57,451
- Not no one.
- Look, I know this is hard to hear.

243
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,219
But, Ethan, the great American novel

244
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,306
is now the massive international
young adult series

245
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,183
with film rights and merchandising.

246
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,266
That's the future.

247
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,311
Why are you being so agenty right now?

248
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,939
Your novels all have teenage
protagonists anyway.

249
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:16,986
So you just have to choose a slightly
more exciting genre-y way in. Okay?

250
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,531
Okay, here's one. Vampires
with cancer. Right?

251
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,076
They live forever, they
die forever, right?

252
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,087
Or work backwards.
Start with a title and

253
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:27,038
then come up with the book. Here's one.

254
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,124
Deathball. What's Deathball?

255
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,628
I don't know, but it sounds awesome,
right? No one survives Deathball.

256
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,090
You and I will crack this. Like the
stuff we wrote together in college.

257
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,302
And it just might become the next
massive international success.

258
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,304
[Mimics Explosion]

259
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,727
[High-Pitched Voice] Oh, my God!
It's amazing!

260
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,896
Max, YA is destructive,
do you understand?

261
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,817
It's about adults who refuse to grow up
and instead they read books for kids!

262
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,403
It prevents you moving
forward and living your life

263
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,488
and it is destroying our culture!

264
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,909
- So that's a yes?
- Yes, fuck you, it's a yes.

265
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,662
Thank you so much for
organizing this so last minute.

266
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,402
This is why we moved
to New York, right?

267
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,082
Yep, friend group.

268
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,489
I found at my last
reunion, I didn't have

269
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,837
much in common with my Hofstra friends.

270
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,967
Well, we got lucky, because we consider
our college friends to be our family.

271
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,678
My family is my family.

272
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,761
[Jon Laughs]

273
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,848
[Jon] So, what's your deal?

274
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,560
Lisa's an attorney. You've
known her for ten years.

275
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,354
That's okay. I used to work
for the ACLU in Michigan.

276
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,398
What? So you're a bleeding heart?

277
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,737
Well, no, not any more. Now I work as
a general counsel for a hedge fund.

278
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,031
- Which one?
- Blackstool Group.

279
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,492
- Is that Degrasso's shop?
- Yeah, it is.

280
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,327
I like this one.

281
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,829
[Sam] Her name is Lisa.

282
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,541
Lisa, Pisa. Pisa, pizza.
Lisa, Lisa... Got it.

283
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,753
We are just so happy you guys are here.

284
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,214
If there's anything we can do to
ease the transition, let us know.

285
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,800
- Like maybe buying us a bed?
- Oh, my gosh.

286
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:03,978
I'm sorry, what?

287
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,729
[Lisa] Sam and Jon
bought us a bed today.

288
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:07,346
We did?

289
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,766
Wow. Thank you. That was
totally unnecessary.

290
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,226
- I agree.
- It's just a little housewarming gift.

291
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,479
- A four poster from Holly Hunt.
- Still weird.

292
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,314
[Sam] Anyway, enough about beds.

293
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,941
Yeah, I want to hear what
Max said about Storm.

294
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,027
Storm? What is Storm?

295
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,184
Storm is this amazing
novel that Ethan's

296
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,281
been working on for the past two years.

297
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,372
Yeah.

298
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:29,202
- I don't like fiction. No offense.
- None taken.

299
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,580
My three favorite books, Liar's
Poker, Moneyball and The Big Short.

300
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,166
- So you're a Michael Lewis fan.
- Who's that?

301
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,586
- He's the...
- It's not bestseller stuff, you know.

302
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,714
It's like literary fiction.
There's not a lot of money.

303
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,258
Well, actually...

304
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,429
Max thinks it's going
to be a huge sale.

305
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,348
- Flagship property.
- Really?

306
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,102
- Really?
- Oh, my God! Honey, that is so amazing!

307
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,939
- Thank you, yes.
- I am so proud of you!

308
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,817
- It's big money.
- Do you know what? Let's celebrate!

309
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,486
You haven't seen our country house.
You should come.

310
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,425
I'll invite everybody to Connecticut.

311
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,556
And I'm not taking no
for an answer, Froshy.

312
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,866
This is so great.

313
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,457
Could you believe how hard Ethan
was trying to downplay his book?

314
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,335
He was clearly so excited about it.

315
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,796
Why can't he just admit it?
It's kind of pathetic.

316
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,756
You bought them a bed?

317
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,093
Yes. What is the big deal? I
buy beds for people every day.

318
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,928
Yeah, with their money, not ours.

319
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,001
I know you love your
college friends, but

320
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,015
when you see them, you
all become bitches,

321
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,101
all the sniping and showing off.

322
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,062
You don't have to show off.
We don't have to compete.

323
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,690
What's the girl's name? Pizza.

324
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,776
- Her name is not Pizza, it's Lisa.
- Right, yeah.

325
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,530
And I'm not competing with them, I'm
talking about them, I'm processing.

326
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,323
I'm trying to download with you.

327
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,909
Why won't you do that with me?
You make me feel crazy.

328
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,662
They live their lives, we live ours.
It's irrelevant.

329
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,707
I don't spend my time thinking
about people other than us.

330
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,542
I think about whether you're happy.

331
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,044
I think about whether
our children are happy.

332
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,754
That's what matters to me.

333
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,590
[Whistles]

334
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,011
[Giggling]

335
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,604
Yeah, so, we've been trying,
really, for about a year now.

336
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,439
- Yeah.
- A year? That's it?

337
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,399
That's not very long. Why are you here?

338
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,487
Well, we haven't used protection
in, like, eight years.

339
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,989
- I'd say eight years, yeah.
- Alright.

340
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,409
But that's pretty average,
right, for somebody...

341
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,621
- That's normal, right?
- Well, it's good that you're here.

342
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,707
Yeah, right, okay.

343
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,044
And I see you had one pregnancy that
was terminated after six weeks.

344
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,755
- Yeah, that was in college.
- It's before my time.

345
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,137
None of your labs look out of the
ordinary and your ultrasound looks good.

346
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,181
So we're gonna get to
the bottom of this.

347
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,099
- Good, fantastic.
- Amazing.

348
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,603
And in the meantime, maybe stop
grabbing each other's balls.

349
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,647
Oh, okay, yes, I'll
make a note of that.

350
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,315
No, I was joking.

351
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,514
When we met, you guys
had your handshake

352
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,653
and you were grabbing
each other's balls.

353
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,405
- When you... with Max.
- When we met you at Marianne's.

354
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,698
And don't wear a Speedo.

355
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,285
- Right.
- Correct dress. We will not...

356
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,204
No, I'm serious, don't wear a Speedo.

357
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:20,372
Oh, you're saying... Okay, that's real.

358
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:22,138
- Correct.
- We understand now, I think.

359
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:24,185
Press to change and
don't wear a Speedo.

360
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,252
Alright.

361
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:26,848
[Jokingly] And don't get in a hot tub!

362
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,343
Oh, and before you go...

363
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,640
I just want to write down the
cost of this, after insurance,

364
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,642
so we're all on the same page.

365
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,438
If you have any questions, please
feel free to let us know, alright?

366
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,024
- Mm-hmm.
- [Very High-Pitched] Yeah.

367
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,736
- [Even Higher] Yeah.
- Okay? Alright?

368
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,783
Does this include the friends
and family discount?

369
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,494
- Sure.
- Yeah.

370
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,664
- Thank you.
- Good luck. We will talk soon.

371
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,417
- Let me know if you have any questions.
- Thank you.

372
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,127
- Bye-bye. You got it.
- Talk soon.

373
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,545
Oh, and don't get a massage.

374
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,755
- Sorry, who?
- What? Don't get a massage?

375
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,840
- Right.
- Okay.

376
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,594
That's a joke. Someone said I was
too rigid on a comment card.

377
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,137
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

378
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,139
[Felix] Okay, this is over. Goodbye.

379
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,351
No, you didn't, Edward.

380
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,937
I don't know which guy I would choose.

381
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:31,277
[Sam] Why didn't you tell me you and
Lisa were trying to have a kid?

382
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,365
[Ethan] Why did you buy us a bed?

383
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,075
Yours, Ethan.

384
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,455
[Sam] Why are you sending me texts?

385
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,706
Delete immediately.

386
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,751
[Ethan] Don't worry, this
is Marianne's computer.

387
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,377
Yours, Ethan.

388
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,590
Oh, no! This is Marianne's computer.

389
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,716
Yours, Ethan.

390
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,551
[Metal Rattling]

391
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,059
Just the rabbit.

392
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,061
This is so typical of Sam.

393
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,396
We're all here, living
in the same city,

394
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,982
and yet we have to schlep out
to Connecticut to see her.

395
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,110
Yeah. You'll really love her
house, though, it's beautiful.

396
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,447
Of course it's beautiful. Everything
Sam touches is beautiful.

397
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,450
She makes me feel so inferior,
like I suck or something.

398
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,578
It's like she's always a senior
and I'm a permanent freshman.

399
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,332
- She literally still calls me Froshy.
- I know, honey, it's horrible.

400
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,418
- I just had to get that off my chest.
- Yeah, I know.

401
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,879
And I think Froshy is
a term of endearment.

402
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,714
- I don't think it is.
- I think it is.

403
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,049
[Marianne] It's really cute.

404
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,944
- [Ethan] Hey, can we put the top down?
- [Lisa] That sounds fun!

405
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,889
[Marianne] It's a funny story.
No, I cannot.

406
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,851
- [Ethan] Okay. I'll give it a crack.
- [Marianne] Oh, please don't.

407
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,147
- [Ethan] There we go.
- [Lisa] That's nice.

408
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,816
There we go.

409
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,234
There we go.

410
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,031
- It's just stuck there, isn't it?
- Yeah. Do you want to drive?

411
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,409
Yeah, no, I'll drive.

412
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,703
It's like a car sail.

413
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,496
Hey, can you see out the back?

414
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,747
No.

415
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,499
This seems dangerous.

416

[Engine Revs]

417
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,713
What are you doing?

418
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,341
[Tires Screech]

419
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,887
- Problem solved.
- We'll pay for that.

420
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,850
[Ethan] Look at this thing. It's like
we're in a Black Mirror episode.

421
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,730
- Stupid looking truck.
- At least it has a roof.

422
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:32,815
[Ethan Giggles]

423
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,151
Look at how she's dressed,
it's Black Mirror.

424
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,264
Hi! It's so good to see you guys!

425
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,567
- [Sam] Thank you for coming.
- [Lisa] Hey, how are you?

426
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:42,742
Good! Come on in. Hi!

427
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,618
- Hey, good to see you.
- Hi, yeah.

428
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,702
- Okay.
- You, too.

429
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,663
[Lisa] Whose car is that out front?

430
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,791
It's mine. I got it as my early
40th birthday present to myself.

431
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,752
And I don't care if you don't like it.

432
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,962
- Did you guys see that car out front?
- Yeah.

433
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,964
Do you think it transforms
into a giant asshole?

434
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,092
You guys, no, listen.

435
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,971
There are plenty of YA novels that are
every bit as good as adult books.

436
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,072
What?

437
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,850
To Kill a Mockingbird gave
birth to the entire genre.

438
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,613
- Harper Lee is a national treasure.
- [Marianne] I love Judy Blume.

439
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,355
Harry Potter. I'd read one
of those books every year.

440
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,274
I mean, it's all I have time for.

441
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,693
You don't work. You
have nothing but time.

442
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,697
Whatever. Why don't you go get in
your truck and go find Jason Bourne?

443
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,162
JK Rowling's a modern-day Dickens,
except better and more successful.

444
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,831
- That's true.
- You guys, you cannot be serious.

445
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:35,795
YA is not great literature. I mean,
it's literally for undeveloped minds.

446
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,589
I could not disagree with
you more emphatically.

447
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,883
Honey, Catcher in the
Rye is essentially YA.

448
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,761
That is a novel about a young person,

449
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:48,390
not trash about teens in the
future with bows and arrows.

450
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:52,895
Why do you need bows and arrows in the
future? Like, I don't understand it.

451
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:57,858
No, I like those Hunger Game
movies starring that girl.

452
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,946
They're exciting but you always
know they're gonna turn out okay.

453
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,282
Oh, my God. Nobody listen to him.

454
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,411
Well, you know, I just think that YA

455
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,998
is the most interesting thing
happening in fiction today.

456
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,542
- What?
- Hear, hear.

457
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,043
- I do.
- You don't think that.

458
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:20,673
And for good reason. Your last book
was a New York Times notable book.

459
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,633
I mean, you're a great writer.

460
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,094
There's no way you can like this stuff.

461
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,514
Ethan and I also talked about the
commercial side of publishing.

462
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,099
Yes, like Storm.

463
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,935
I mean, that is a novel for adults.

464
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,522
And like, Max, you said,
this is a flagship property.

465
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,149
And you did that without vampires

466
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,528
and kids running around mazes
or whatever they're doing now.

467
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,030
Storm's dead. We're not
going to sell Storm.

468
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,698
What?

469
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,494
What?

470
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,954
I thought...

471
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,083
I thought that's why we
were talking about... YA.

472
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,710
I'm sorry, I didn't...

473
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,130
Never mind. I didn't... I didn't
realize that you hadn't...

474
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,591
I shouldn't have.

475
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,304
I'm sorry, I'm confused. Why did you
say that you were going to sell it?

476
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,764
I mean, we were out...

477
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:15,394
We were at dinner and you announced it.
We celebrated with champagne.

478
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,397
Well, we were almost at
a sale of it, right?

479
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,524
We... talked about selling it.

480
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,693
And then everyone read it

481
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,071
and decided to not... to not sell it.

482
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,867
So why would you tell
me that you sold it?

483
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,745
Because I knew you'd overreact.

484
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,289
Because all you guys have
had this expectation,

485
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,583
that was born in college when I was 18,

486
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:42,004
that I was going to be some kind of
famous Nobel-Prize-winning author.

487
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,381
[Nick] I don't.

488
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,925
I think you're pretty good, but...

489
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,761
- But, like, a Nobel Prize?
- Yeah.

490
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,264
I'm sorry to disappoint the rest of
you, but it's not going to happen.

491
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:56,101
I'm not going to leap into the literary
pantheon, which no longer exists.

492
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,946
Can you back me up on this, Max?

493
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,730
I don't know what is
safe to talk about.

494
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,814
Just back me up on it.

495
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,858
It's fading.

496
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,486
So I'm doing a YA now,
that's what I'm going to do.

497
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,281
If you want something
funny to write about,

498
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:14,328
a few months ago, Dashiell called one
of his classmates at school the C word.

499
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,415
- Cunt.
- Yeah.

500
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,751
- Oh, my God.
- Well, I...

501
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,419
Excuse me.

502
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,391
I'm sorry, Ethan, I thought
you told her about Storm.

503
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,725
It's okay.

504
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,187
It's something you would tell your
wife, something you talk about.

505
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,785
[Goofy Voice] I already said it's okay.

506
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,061
Alright.

507
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,569
Well.

508
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,908
Yeah.

509
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,452
What is so bad about "cunt"?

510
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,872
Well, it's extremely
offensive to women.

511
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,749
- Is it?
- Yeah.

512
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,210
- Really?
- Yeah, I would say so.

513
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,630
But it's like, what
can you say any more?

514
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,841
I feel like they've
taken everything away.

515
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,720
When they came for "retarded,"
I said nothing, you know?

516
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,889
When they came for "that's
so gay," I said nothing.

517
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,892
But it's like, you got to draw
the line somewhere, you know?

518
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,978
It's like you can't take away "cunt".

519
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,271
You can't...

520
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,523
take away "cunt"!

521
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,652
- It's such a great fucking word.
- Give me this.

522
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,074
Oh, my God, that's so good.

523
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,581
Why would you bring Dashiell up? That
is not a funny dinner party story.

524
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,875
It's not funny!

525
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,002
I can't tell a story about my own son?

526
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,755
- I don't understand the code here.
- There's no code.

527
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,757
I'm ashamed of Dashiell's behavior

528
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,302
and I don't want you dining out on
it, especially around my friends.

529
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,928
See, that's what this is about.

530
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,972
Sorry I didn't go to Harvard with you.

531
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,726
You get off on acting like you're too
good for me around them. It's bullshit.

532
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,854
Telling me to be quiet
at my own dinner table?

533
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,690
You're all living in the past.
You should let the past go.

534
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,859
The present's a pretty
cool place to be.

535
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,058
You know what I don't understand?
I don't

536
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,197
understand how he even knows that word.

537
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,865
Do you use that word?

538
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,283
Do you?

539
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,493
Do you?

540
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,496
"Judgmental Cunt" is a Kid Cudi song.

541
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,372
He heard it in my car.

542
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,291
A four-year-old?

543
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,044
- He's four years old!
- It's a catchy song.

544
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,713
- He should be listening to Raffi!
- He prefers Kid Cudi!

545
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,466
You and I both know Raffi sucks!

Yes.
