1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:02,210
Previously on Billions.

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,170
You're still interested in a
bank charter, right?

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,255
You know I am.

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,589
He has a new toy, a bank.

5
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,509
And nothing to stop him
from making mistakes.

6
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,802
I'm the bait.

7
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,513
And the bank is the trap.

8
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,765
How are we taking
down Bobby Axelrod?

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,601
Axe used his black magic to
get my commission squashed.

10
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,229
Why'd you do it? Why'd
you fuck him up like that?

11
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,231
I've come to believe
that you require oversight.

12
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,859
Charles Rhodes Senior
has been selected.

13
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,444
You're the donor?

14
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,195
My father is owned by him now.

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,281
We need
some fucking deposits.

16
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,490
There is cannabis money.

17
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,075
Send me everything
you have on it.

18
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,869
Do you want to be
done? Then let's be done.

19
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,370
Pay me off in the next 48 hours.

20
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,873
I need you to buy out my
shares of Mase Carbon today.

21
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,584
Welcome to my home.
A Jeffersonian dinner.

22
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,378
-We did it.
-That argument was a nice touch.

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,838
My two enemies have linked up.

24
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,673
Find out which
cannabis companies

25
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,008
Mike Prince is pursuing.

26
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,676
Whatever he's going after,
I wanna take it.

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,387
I was trying to ruin
Tanner in your eyes.

28
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,016
Because I couldn't stand
you being with him or anyone.

29
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,727
I feel the same things
when I look at you.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

31
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:44,395
Childhood living...

32
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,276
Go fuck yourself!

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,486
Huh?

34
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,779
That's what he said.

35
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,739
-Who?
-Rhodes Senior,

36
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,032
the leathery old bastard.

37
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,951
Is Axe about or is he
still down with the 'Vid?

38
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,244
He's not here.

39
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,829
Raise him.

40
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,506
There's an issue.

41
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,050
You're aware the
bank's registered

42
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,927
as a Delaware corp,

43
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,720
so the state AG has say,

44
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,557
and they've still got us in
a probationary headlock.

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,018
Prevents us from
taking on a large

46
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,020
concentrated
depositor such as...

47
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,814
-The cannabis business.
-Right.

48
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,359
Well, we need that fucking
money. Bank's dead without it.

49
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,902
A thought occurs.

50
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,779
Isn't this what
bankruptcy is for?

51
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,283
Stick the bad shit on the bank's
balance sheet and declare.

52
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,119
Go back to Axe Cap,
free and easy, the way it was.

53
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,620
Nah, we burned the boats.

54
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,080
New structure is
asset management

55
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,290
runs through the bank.

56
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,958
It fails,
we got a failed investment arm.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,334
Investors gone. Fuck!

58
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,837
Which is why we so deliberately
chose our special trustee

59
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,881
for just such a moment as this,

60
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,883
to recommend us in his report,

61
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,009
only to be told--

62
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,635
"Go fuck yourself."

63
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,554
Uh, excuse the mouth, ma'am.

64
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,847
Not at all, Hard Bob.

65
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,515
The old man figured
out he had the leverage

66
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,892
and he figured he'd use it.

67
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,435
Why don't I go and talk to him?

68
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,937
See if I can remind him
of what the right thing is

69
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,315
and to fucking do it.

70
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,408
You look good.

71
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,618
I should.

72
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,912
Got the old ashes
hauled this morning.

73
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,079
Oh, okay.

74
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,414
Got laid is what I mean.

75
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,874
Yeah, copy on that.

76
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,958
Test flight.

77
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,169
Went fine,
if not quite as vigorous

78
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,296
a session as I might like,

79
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,506
but building to it,
building to it.

80
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,133
Tonight, Roxanne is gonna--

81
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,718
That's far too much info

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,094
for a former daughter-in-law.

83
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,305
-We're also coworkers.
-Even worse.

84
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,225
And this renewed
vitality is all thanks to Axe,

85
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,061
as I imagine you are
here to remind me.

86
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,104
Who'd think you need reminding?

87
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,814
I know you're grateful.

88
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,984
I'm here to talk specifics
about your mission.

89
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,196
You guys need me to testify
to the Delaware State AG

90
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,448
on Axe's behalf
about his character

91
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,827
and the robust ethics
on display at the bank

92
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,870
and all that.

93
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,871
Correct.

94
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,581
The problem is...

95
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,625
I would be lying.

96
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,127
Lying is no more
a problem for you

97
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,047
than shooting free
throws was for Steve Nash.

98
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,423
You're excellent at it.

99
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,676
It's what sets you apart
from everyone else.

100
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,511
What if I simply
don't feel like it?

101
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,974
Just walk away from the game,
much as Mr. Nash did.

102
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,060
Your feelings have nothing
to do with repaying your debt.

103
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,522
I'm why
the damn bank exists.

104
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,150
So I'd say I've already
repaid my life debt to Axe

105
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,194
with far more than a thank-you.

106
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,613
Bullshit. We both
know you'll be carrying

107
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,200
that obligation around as
long as that kidney's filtering.

108
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,827
I got a new lease on life.

109
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,370
I don't want to
spend it in prison.

110
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,497
You also don't want to
spend it on the sidelines.

111
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,666
That's why you hightailed
it over to Chuck's

112
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,834
at Bobby's behest.

113
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,044
We both know you
have zero problem

114
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,963
being on his team.

115
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,632
You just see an angle.

116
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,427
Like the Schmatta kid himself.

117
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,971
So I have to play it.

118
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,431
What do you want?

119
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,932
I want...

120
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,143
to be 20 years younger.

121
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,812
I'll take money and power.

122
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,815
I want a nugget of his
cannabis concession.

123
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,192
He's never giving you ownership,
you know that.

124
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,777
Can we just skip
the middle stages

125
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,571
of this negotiation, please?

126
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,865
Meaningful profit share.

127
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,409
But I'll-I'll be
honest with you.

128
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,329
I feel less good
about all this now.

129
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,331
And that's not posturing.

130
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,958
It's one thing to go
against your own son.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,086
But when it's with his ex,

132
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,796
and mortal enemy--

133
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,173
Well, knowing you as I do,

134
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,884
I imagine when I get
you your profit share,

135
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,886
this goes away.

136
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,597
Yeah.

137
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,058
Knowing me as you do,

138
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,477
I'd think so too.

139
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,910
Welcome to New York.

140
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,870
Trip okay?

141
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,622
Other than having
to lie to our friends

142
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,040
about how we got here.

143
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,875
I don't anymore.

144
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,127
The thing is when we
were in high school,

145
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,837
I was embarrassed
to fly private too.

146
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,756
Instead of lying
about flying private

147
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,174
just bring your
friends with you.

148
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,425
Stop and pick
them up on the way.

149
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,010
I'd prefer to do
the other thing,

150
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,220
fly JetBlue.

151
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,346
You think you do.

152
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,931
Enough of our crap, Dad.

153
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,266
How you hanging in
after that massacre on TV?

154
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,560
Believe me,
I'm fine. Business is sharp elbows.

155
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,978
I'm used to it.

156
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,897
We're sure that's not really
the way that happened.

157
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,149
I talk about me and my issues

158
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,776
with the folks
here all day long.

159
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,361
Let's talk about the two of you.

160
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,488
Can't beat you at your game,
so, sure.

161
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,533
This summer, you guys should
do a whole thing with your people.

162
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,119
Start off at our place at
Ile de Ré for a few weeks,

163
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,453
trek through Europe.

164
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,205
Guess we'll skip Copenhagen,
huh?

165
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,749
Yeah,
yeah, cross it off.

166
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,085
We want to work. We're ready.

167
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,586
Overrated.

168
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,754
You'll get there.

169
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,298
We've been feeling like it's
time to roll up the sleeves.

170
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,508
Yeah. All my people,

171
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,093
the ones you'd have
me bring over there

172
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,428
like we're on Bling Empire

173
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,054
are gonna have sick
internships and gigs.

174
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,472
And then they'll all
have jobs locked in

175
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,099
if they aren't
doing grad school.

176
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,976
Everyone from B school
has stuff locked in too.

177
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,394
I don't regret much.

178
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,146
But I regret not
getting to just live a little

179
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,022
when I was young.

180
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,274
I couldn't afford to. I--

181
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,234
I had to start. You don't.

182
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,527
We're gonna fall behind.

183
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,612
-Who're you gonna fall behind?
-Our whole cohort,

184
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,449
like moving in step with them,
ahead of them.

185
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,075
It's not a race like that.

186
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,202
He still doesn't understand
what we've been robbed of.

187
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,454
-Robbed?

188
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,290
Yeah, of failing,
of advancing on our own

189
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,916
because we have to.

190
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,043
You got to do a
thing by yourself.

191
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,378
We'll always be...

192
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,629
Mike Prince's daughters.

193
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,882
Yes. Someone will
always say that garbage.

194
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,133
You gotta tune it out.

195
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,801
Hard to do when it's
your own voice saying it.

196
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,428
-It's not even about

197
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,096
if having money
makes things easier.

198
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,432
It's just putting something
on the line for real.

199
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,058
And you were robbed of that?

200
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,811
Yeah, we were. There's
such a safe landing for us,

201
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,396
no matter what.

202
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,981
We might as well try.

203
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,357
But also whatever jobs we get,

204
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,735
people will think it's
because of you anyway.

205
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,154
That's true. At first.

206
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,574
But hey,

207
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,368
if you want a chance to fail...

208
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,995
-We don't plan to fail.
-Fine.

209
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,789
If you want
a chance to succeed,

210
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,708
help me with Hypercube.

211
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,169
-Your digital banking startup?
-That's right.

212
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,881
We need to onboard a
major depositor client.

213
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,137
Wait. Really? Weed?

214
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,597
Lawful weed.

215
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,683
Business and financial services
for the legal cannabis industry.

216
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,020
The woman who runs this company,
getting her to jump on board

217
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,190
will take insight, enthusiasm,

218
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,068
an understanding of the space,
intelligence.

219
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,778
In a word, youth.

220
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,154
Yours.

221
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,533
You want to take a
meeting? Win her over?

222
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,993
Scooter will supervise at first,

223
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,745
but you could be
the client-facing piece

224
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,247
in this space.

225
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,210
-In.
-Oh yeah, fully.

226
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,920
And if it works out,
can we stay involved?

227
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,047
Try to close first.

228
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,299
You don't have to
worry about the rest now.

229
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,592
Study up.

230
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,470
Okay, wow,
this is very interesting.

231
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,597
Yeah, worth a shot.

232
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,391
Dad, this is legit.

233
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,320
That looks exquisite on you.

234
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,948
Looks like Zales
in a push-up bra.

235
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,700
I want the 600-karat black opal,

236
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,370
the uncut gem shit.
What do you got?

237
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,289
I may have something
in my other case.

238
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,457
Are we looking for
an engagement?

239
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,585
Does Superman take to
the air because he needs

240
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,462
to be in Chicago
for a convention?

241
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,591
He flies because he can.

242
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,759
This is that.

243
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,680
Are you sure you're ready?

244
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,473
"I'm ready for
anything" is basically

245
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,850
my first, middle and last name.

246
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,186
Even meeting my father?
Most guys don't want to.

247
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,230
Right. The dad dinner.

248
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,648
Sure.

249
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,567
I'll look him in the eye,
give him a firm handshake,

250
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,652
and assure him my
intentions are honorable.

251
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,571
He'll see right
through that act.

252
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,531
He's a lawyer,
so he's spent his life

253
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,325
slicing through
bullshit artists.

254
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,534
Hmm.

255
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,952
He can look at people and know

256
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,370
what's really inside of them.

257
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,289
He's self-made. Tough.

258
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,291
Chuck Norris tough or
Guido the killer pimp?

259
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,294
See, he'll get that reference,
probably, and know if it's good.

260
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,172
So I earn his respect
by going toe to toe.

261
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,214
Like a fighter.

262
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,257
No, kiss his ass.

263
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,550
-But do it well.
-Ah.

264
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,802
Trombone blown, Tom Byron-style.

265
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,970
You got it.

266
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,555
Another reference I don't--

267
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,390
The important thing is he will.

268
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,018
Pigeon blood ruby.

269
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,355
That's a hell of a stone.

270
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,939
Keep it on ice.

271
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,150
I'll call you back for it.

272
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,486
After I succeed with Big Daddy.

273
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,240
There's the precedent.

274
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,533
That's one way to go.

275
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,410
It's your call.

276
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,371
Yeah.

277
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,500
Wow. This is why we got into it,
no?

278
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,001
To argue before
those nine robes?

279
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,672
Even I can't be blasé about
my first Supreme Court brief.

280
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,256
-Hmm.
-Though it's tempered

281
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,008
by the fact that we're
not really trying a case

282
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,260
that might change the world
but merely baiting a hook.

283
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,680
The thing about arguments
before SCOTUS is

284
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,891
they are never about what
they're purported to be about.

285
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,101
Hmm.

286
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,644
Neither are the
opinions or dissents,

287
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,313
but everyone just
presses forward.

288
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,857
As you are doing,
Ms. Sacker, impressively.

289
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,568
Oh,
I'm gonna sell it because I believe it.

290
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,903
And it will be in the record.

291
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,280
Solicitor General DeGiulio
shall be duly impressed.

292
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,368
And soon enough it really
will be you at the lectern.

293
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,763
Are those them?

294
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,442
These.. are the Glengarry leads.

295
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,360
But do not try to steal them.

296
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,697
They will be handed out to closers,
which,

297
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,574
unlike Dave Moss
and Charlie Levine,

298
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,701
you will be because Axe is.

299
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,369
Those are the Auerbachs,
aren't they?

300
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,456
Axe used to talk about
bringing them out for a huge win.

301
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,623
They are indeed.

302
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,375
-What's a--?
-Red Auerbach, Tuk.

303
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,670
Old-time Boston Celtics
head coach and then GM and...

304
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,673
You can't work here
and not know this stuff.

305
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,133
I've told you before.

306
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,135
Ask me anything about wrestling.

307
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,096
The NWA, AWA, WWWF.

308
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,223
The Territories? I've got it.

309
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,768
Even know who the
Third Executioner was.

310
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,644
I'm just not up on
old-time basketball yet.

311
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,481
Well,
these cigars were very fucking significant.

312
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,984
They were and are. Red
Auerbach's Punch cigars.

313
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,361
After bringing nine
titles to the city of Boston,

314
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,988
he could smoke
wherever he damn pleased.

315
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,449
But his favorite place was
on the bench on the parquet

316
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,744
of the old Boston Garden
when victory was assured.

317
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,829
Give me one of those,
I'll light it up right here,

318
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,123
deal with the smoke
alarms and fines later.

319
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,792
We'll smoke them when Red did:

320
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,335
The moment victory is in hand,
when our bank is solvent,

321
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,337
not when the game
is still in doubt.

322
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,389
We really didn't
have to do it like this.

323
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,682
I would have wired it.

324
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,769
Sometimes auspicious
beginnings and auspicious

325
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,395
endings need to
be done in person.

326
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,524
You wanted me to have
to hand you 25 million.

327
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,986
Like this.

328
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,117
I guess I just wanted to
see what it would be like

329
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,370
to hold this much at once.

330
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,498
Perhaps see if anything
rushed through me.

331
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,876
But, uh...

332
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,879
No,

333
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,549
just sadness.

334
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,677
And a cold certainty that

335
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,137
none of this ever had to happen.

336
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,430
There we agree.

337
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,641
So you still get a rush
from the money alone?

338
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,977
Don't ask me those ki--

339
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,687
I'm gonna head out.

340
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,190
And like that, lines are drawn.

341
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,985
No, tattooed, permanently.

342
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,779
Some of your money to me.

343
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,072
The rest of you to him.

344
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,658
Congratulations, then,
are in order, to you.

345
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,410
For orchestrating it all.

346
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,495
Since the moment
you set your sights

347
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,830
on Axe five years ago,

348
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,040
you have orchestrated
a perfect plan

349
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,502
to impel us together,
which makes no sense.

350
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,046
Unless someone knows you,

351
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,215
which I have.

352
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,385
Goodbye.

353
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,610
I'm hearing rumblings...

354
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,320
that Solicitor General DeGiulio

355
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,322
is awaiting a brief
from the NY AG.

356
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,657
Once he has it,
he officially asks

357
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,367
the Supreme Court to grant cert

358
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,244
in a financial
services case which

359
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,373
would clear the way for
processing cannabis money.

360
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,208
I don't see SCOTUS saying no.

361
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,378
Looks like your read on
Chuck's plan was center mass.

362
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,088
Track this brief. Use Hall.

363
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,799
Make sure it says
what we need it to say.

364
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,259
I know you're anxious.

365
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,804
But if you act and bank this
money before cert is granted,

366
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,723
and we can argue
a coming change,

367
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,725
you'll be whacked
with civil charges.

368
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,143
You could get your
charter stripped.

369
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,188
Which is why we have
to act when it goes in,

370
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,856
but right at that moment.

371
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,816
Prince has made the
same determination.

372
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,319
We gotta vault over him.

373
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,030
Axe, seems we have news.

374
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,407
Tell me more about this
company Prince is targeting.

375
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,702
Called FYC, Fine Young Cannabis.

376
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,537
CEO is Dawn Winslow,

377
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,122
former music producer.

378
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,333
She got outta that to
pursue her true love.

379
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,126
Now her company
is a market leader,

380
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,837
one point six bil in
revenue last year alone.

381
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,214
Axe, I gotta say,

382
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,883
being too early is as
bad as being too late.

383
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,843
In this case worse.

384
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,054
If you onboard
this cash too quick,

385
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,014
you'll get slapped
with civil penalties.

386
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:18,227
Thanks, Hard Bob. I already
got that from my actual lawyer.

387
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,688
And what do we got to land FYC?

388
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,649
No, she's not gonna sign on
for free checking.

389
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,069
I hate to say it,
but you need to outbid him.

390
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,406
Banks are basically paying
zero interest right now.

391
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,699
We go the other way--

392
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,701
I don't like overpaying. Ever.

393
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,035
But as a new bank,

394
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,496
setting up a new
desperate precedent like this

395
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,373
is suicide.

396
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,545
I know how Prince
plans to lock up FYC:

397
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,547
-with his daughters.
-Cagey move.

398
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,049
Good for branding
and the CEO Winslow

399
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,176
gets to look like she's
mentoring the next gen.

400
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,138
-Total bullshit, but cagey.
- What's our counter?

401
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,848
What do we know
about Winslow's leaks?

402
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,975
Not fucking much.
She's refusing to speak

403
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,768
with anyone from Axe Bank.

404
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,103
-Including...?
-Including Axe.

405
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,564
Lady says she's
entering into an exclusive

406
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,483
negotiating period with Prince.

407
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,610
Lady says that means something.

408
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,030
It means you all do better.

409
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,706
We can't stop Prince from
having his meeting with her,

410
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,375
or from agreeing to a deal
in principle, even.

411
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,754
We gotta wedge in there in
the moments right before closing.

412
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,173
But Chieftain,
if she won't even meet with you...

413
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,966
She doesn't have
a deal to shop yet.

414
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,886
By the time she does,
we need to top her.

415
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,680
But believe me,
before she locks it in,

416
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,974
she's gonna have one
last look at what's out there.

417
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,476
It's human nature.

418
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,395
And I'll be what
she's starin' at.

419
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,567
You don't look like the
man I know you to be.

420
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,071
And what man do
you think that is?

421
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,031
One on the verge of
beating Bobby Axelrod

422
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,825
and thumping his
chest in triumph.

423
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,454
What, did the meeting with
Winslow fall through?

424
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,499
Meeting's lined up, but I'm not.

425
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,209
I'm not sure I
can let it happen.

426
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,628
I've been thinking
we've done enough,

427
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,839
and Axe can cruise
on in there and take it.

428
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,549
No, no, no.

429
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,885
We need the rabbit
zipping around the rail,

430
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,137
so the greyhound
chases it headlong.

431
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,806
-You're the rabbit.
-Mm-hm.

432
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,308
Without you, maybe he stops
and thinks about it

433
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,268
instead of lunging.

434
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,485
You don't know if you can walk
your daughters through the door.

435
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,155
Deploy them like
that. That's what this is.

436
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,617
Look, I get it.

437
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,077
I'm living it with my old man.

438
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,954
It's a little different.
He's hardly an innocent.

439
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,164
True. But...

440
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,874
you can't really
say you're playing

441
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,794
unless you're willing to put
your highest-value pieces

442
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,087
on the board.

443
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,131
They're not pieces.
They're my children.

444
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,715
My first charge in this world

445
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,925
is to protect them,

446
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,386
not set them off like
flashbang grenades.

447
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,054
You are protecting them.

448
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,306
Better,
you're arming them to protect themselves.

449
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,642
Yes,
a consequence of this action might be

450
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,145
that they become wary,
less open.

451
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,772
That may be of some
benefit in business.

452
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,816
But I'm not doing
this as a teaching tool.

453
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,736
I'm doing it for my own aims
and that is too bitter a lesson.

454
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,823
You can't
safeguard your kids from pain.

455
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,493
But you can protect
them from evil.

456
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,078
And we both know

457
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,413
that's what Axe is.

458
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,708
And that's what a world
is that bows before him.

459
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,794
They're how he
knows you're serious.

460
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,881
And that it hurts
you to use them...

461
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,718
that's why you're
the man you are.

462
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,519
Don't do it.

463
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,189
Godammit! Diego is fired.

464
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,357
He only tipped me
off because I told him

465
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,443
I was worried about
you taking the car out

466
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,819
while still recovering.

467
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,863
He cares about your well-being,
as do I.

468
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,575
Touching,
but I'm fit as Charles Atlas in '53.

469
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,786
Well, then do to Axe and company

470
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,873
what Mr. Atlas would
do a ThighMaster.

471
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,249
Squeeze him.

472
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,251
Atlas, good as he was, is dead,

473
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,129
and so is any chance of
me doing what you want.

474
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,965
Besides, his gag was isometrics,

475
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,426
and it was that
pretty blonde gal,

476
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,137
Suzanne Somers,
who made with the ThighMaster.

477
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,515
No matter. I'm here to warn you.

478
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,226
Don't be their rubber stamp.

479
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,895
Take your duties more
seriously than that.

480
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,230
I know my duty. Always have.

481
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,482
That's why you had
food in your belly

482
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,858
and a roof over your head

483
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,570
and monogrammed
boxer shorts in your closet.

484
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,989
I will advise with discretion

485
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,366
-and discernment.

486
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,077
Now whether it's
what you want or not

487
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,328
isn't my problem.

488
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,830
You're so desperate
to stay relevant,

489
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,499
to stay in the game.

490
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,543
You can't see that the
game has passed you by--

491
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,296
Willie Mays in center
field for the Mets,

492
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,883
misunderstanding the dewy
eyes in the crowd for love.

493
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,468
Oh, sonny boy.

494
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,806
You just never understood
me or the Say Hey Kid.

495
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,976
You play until your feet break.

496
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,313
And they carry you
off the field in a box.

497
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,650
And if that's not
convenient for you,

498
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,403
like Billy Joe Royal sang,

499
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,823
"I never promised
you a rose garden."

500
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,659
Sir.

501
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,981
Sorry, I'll be right back.

502
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,946
Next generation's bright.

503
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,364
The girls are tearin' it up.

504
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,826
They prepped their pitch
like Russian gymnasts.

505
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,077
And Winslow?

506
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,289
She's melting like a pad
of butter on a short stack.

507
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,749
I'll go get into final terms

508
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,751
for onboarding her
company's cash.

509
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,711
Good.

510
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,882
And if the account is seized,
then the bank is liable...

511
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,886
...for not knowing which
money came from where.

512
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,013
He'll do it.

513
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,097
How do you know?

514
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,891
I told him not to.

515
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,684
Then I'm sorry.

516
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,728
And... well done.

517
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,491
Okay.

518
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,285
Doing this in person,
nice and official.

519
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,122
So do you want to report
what Delaware banking laws

520
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,332
Axe Bank has violated?

521
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,626
Or should I just
read from the list

522
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,920
and you nod and sign?

523
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,387
Nothing to report.

524
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,182
So he hasn't violated any laws?

525
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,559
None that I'm aware of.

526
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:20,857
No regulations on
probationary terms?

527
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,446
Has he painted
outside the lines?

528
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,574
On the contrary,
noses are clean.

529
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,287
I gotta say I'm...

530
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,123
I'm a little confused.

531
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,083
I'm the pin boy here.

532
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,501
They're all set up for
you to knock them down,

533
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,461
at which point
your son moves in,

534
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,672
we sweep them up together
as we prosecute jointly.

535
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,341
I can't report what hasn't
happened regardless

536
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,634
of my son's plans.

537
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:52,514
I can only discharge
my duty as I see fit.

538
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,392
You understand that if
this goes to prosecution,

539
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,562
you are wrapping
yourself right up in it?

540
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,313
Gotcha.

541
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,774
And my formal recommendation is,

542
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,986
lift the probationary terms.

543
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,700
I'm not gonna pretend
that I'm not confused,

544
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,161
but I've done my part.

545
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,832
I look forward to being
clear of your fucked-up family.

546
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,876
Okay.

547
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,086
Axe Bank has
passed its probation.

548
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,477
This bottle of d'Yquem
Axe wanted you to enjoy

549
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,562
is from the year you were born.

550
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,398
These grapes have made
the same journey you have.

551
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,485
Turned out almost as rich.

552
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,069
I love that trick.

553
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,613
Lets the person
on the receiving end

554
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,449
know you put thought into it,
and work.

555
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,909
Hard to find those bottles.

556
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,285
My compliments to Axe.

557
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,496
Plus, it tastes like honey.

558
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,003
What does he need?

559
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,297
Your networks to air ads

560
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,466
by a certain legal
cannabis company.

561
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,051
Never been a tea smoker.

562
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,512
Never loved the culture
surrounding it either.

563
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,555
And I don't see
myself as being the first

564
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,140
to break this
particular barrier.

565
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,850
You know,
there are no commercials for pot.

566
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,853
I can't really picture myself
on the cover of High Times.

567
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,605
What about Fortune? Forbes?

568
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,566
You'd be on all of them,
like Springsteen in 75.

569
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,443
That was Time and Newsweek

570
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,070
and the pressure
nearly crushed him.

571
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,363
No, no. It made him.

572
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,656
Took him to the next level.

573
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,200
I'd be a pariah
amongst other networks

574
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,160
and likely the FCC.

575
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,495
For about five minutes.

576
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,705
Then they'd be
looking to catch up.

577
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,831
Pretty picture.

578
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,084
Thing is I've already got
my board seat on the bank.

579
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,503
I've already got enough
of everything I need.

580
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,755
Why should I put myself for it?

581
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,215
For your daughter.

582
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,716
We heard whispers
she's running for Congress

583
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,302
and that she's refusing
to take your money,

584
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,679
wants to look self-made.

585
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,931
I admire my daughter
and her convictions.

586
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,684
Yes. But you also
want her to win.

587
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,852
So... Axe will see to
it that enough money

588
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,480
is funneled to her campaign
looking like grassroots,

589
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,025
Internet,
small-donor Squad catnip,

590
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,278
but enough in total to bury

591
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,947
any and all of her opponents.

592
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,409
Long as she doesn't know,
she'll appreciate that.

593
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,202
And I will too.

594
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,121
Good.

595
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,335
Mrs. Winslow,
this, aside from being

596
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,379
the most expensive
album ever sold,

597
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,672
is pretty fuckin' cool.

598
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,258
A gift to you from
Bobby Axelrod.

599
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,304
Wu Tang's    Once
Upon a Time in Shaolin?

600
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,055
A single copy pressed.

601
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,391
Heard of this but
never heard it.

602
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,311
Martin Shkreli paid $2 million
for this a few years back.

603
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,438
How the hell
did    you    get it?

604
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,648
Don't ask me how he got it.

605
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,233
Ask him.

606
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,735
Don't ask me either.

607
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,945
I thought you would
appreciate it and learn from him.

608
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,447
Never get too big and too loud?

609
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,658
Maybe. But his mistake was
being in the wrong drug business.

610
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,620
One that divided people
instead of bringing them together.

611
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,705
Don't do that. And don't
gouge your customers

612
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,874
and you can do
this thing forever.

613
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,167
Never do, never would.

614
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,752
And I am in the
right drug business.

615
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,629
Brings people together
the way "Wild Cherry"

616
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,964
did folks on a dance
floor upon a time.

617
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,592
Is that insecticide keeping
the red spider mites away?

618
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,553
Febreze. So it doesn't smell
like a Wesleyan dorm room

619
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,097
when I finally get
it into the system.

620
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,307
Smart.

621
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,433
I thank you for the present.

622
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,393
It is a true fucking rarity.

623
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,728
But like I told your people,

624
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,730
I'm already committed
to another negotiation.

625
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,732
Not so committed
that you didn't want to see

626
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,692
if you were missing
out on something better.

627
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,402
And you were right,
because you are.

628
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,906
Look,
I'm sure he's offering you a square deal.

629
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,616
And he's filling a need.

630
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,576
You gotta be able
to process and store

631
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,078
your take someplace safe.

632
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,579
But I can do that and more.

633
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,456
I'm offering to
take care of a need

634
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,957
that no one else will touch.

635
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,542
I'm offering legitimacy.

636
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,753
I have a desirable product,
a legal product.

637
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,589
Some states recently marked
it as an essential product.

638
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,383
You're preaching to
a man already walked

639
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,051
the road to Damascus.

640
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,053
But I can get you on TV,

641
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,596
mainstream media buys.

642
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,056
You can get that done?

643
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,518
Networks and weblets avoid
us like we're selling strychnine.

644
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,019
Not anymore.

645
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,731
Widespread ads targeted at
your most coveted customers.

646
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,651
Make your warehouse look
way too small for your cash.

647
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,153
I hate to walk away
from my other suitor

648
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,863
-this late in the game.
-Yeah, I'm sure.

649
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,699
But you'll note I
didn't send someone

650
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,617
who needs to learn
business from you.

651
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,452
I sent my Tom Hagen
because I'm in quarantine.

652
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,705
That just shows you how
important this is to me.

653
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,665
Look,
you've built something very special here.

654
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,750
Busted your ass
to keep expanding it

655
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,585
during some very tough times.

656
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,962
Oh, that's for sure.

657
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,257
Don't you owe it to yourself
to go with the best deal?

658
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,222
I really do.

659
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,480
Ah... the Solicitor General,
as of a moment ago,

660
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,233
is in receipt of your brief.

661
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,199
Excuse me. I have to go.

662
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,243
-Ms. Sacker?
-It's nothing.

663
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,453
Is that right?

664
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:10,123
Why don't you fill me in on
the exact brand of nothing?

665
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,586
Franklin Sacker announces
he's relaxing policies

666
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,880
with regard to
advertising cannabinoids.

667
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,715
Singled out one
company in particular

668
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,967
with some sugar-sweet words.

669
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,469
Let me guess.

670
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,512
Fine Young Cannabis.

671
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,390
I guess my father
is not the only one

672
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,600
Axe has roped in.

673
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,893
Look,
I know that your instinct will be

674
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,145
to confront your dad,
to warn him--

675
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,229
I already warned him.

676
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,564
With the Opportunity Zone.

677
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,316
He ignored me. He
should know better.

678
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,609
Yes, he should.

679
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,694
But perhaps he's been
blinded by an Axelrod

680
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,154
opportunity supernova.

681
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,156
Only way to back him off is to
let him know the law is coming.

682
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,908
Uh... the thing about that is,

683
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,161
if your dad backs out
because he's rattled,

684
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,371
Axe will rattle too.

685
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,748
So...

686
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,708
you gotta let him dangle.

687
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,544
-Chuck--
-Whole operation gets blown

688
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,339
if one piece gets out of order.

689
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,469
Shit!

690
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,973
-Hm.

691
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,850
Uh,
do you really have to do it that way?

692
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,602
What if I just bite the end off?

693
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,312
It'll be wet and uneven.

694
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,189
That's just something
you saw in a movie.

695
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,149
It is something I
saw in a movie.

696
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,484
And when the Wolverine did it--

697
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,445
We've been over this.
You're not Wolverine.

698
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,655
I can be.

699
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,114
With the right diet
and workout program.

700
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,201
Yeah, and if I gargle enough,
I can be Celine Dion.

701
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,705
You going with a V-cutter?
You'll wind up too deep.

702
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,958
Something you've never heard before,
Dollar Bill.

703
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,840
I'm a punch cut man.

704
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,759
Clean draw,
prevents tar accumulation.

705
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,885
Too precious,

706
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,679
too much chance of crumbling.

707
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,305
I go guillotine all the way.

708
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,016
One perfect, decisive chop.

709
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,524
It's not fucking time!

710
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,944
That's what Wags said at first,

711
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,572
but then he passed
them out to us.

712
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,448
Because we won a round.

713
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,158
Back in your pockets.

714
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,410
You can hold on to 'em now

715
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,413
but don't smoke 'em
till Axe gives the word.

716
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,818
I... like that
you're giving them

717
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,571
something to look
forward to at the finish line.

718
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,615
The cigars.

719
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,452
Now,
what are you giving yourself?

720
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,296
You ever been to Fiji?

721
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,634
No. But I know you have.

722
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,636
Yeah. Last year,

723
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,847
with Dean and Gordy.
Came back early.

724
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,934
Well, you said it was
because the kids didn't like it.

725
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,438
I didn't totally buy that.

726
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,566
Yeah. Didn't think you did.

727
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,490
And now,
you know what I'm thinking about?

728
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:40,959
The ocean there's the exact
same temperature as the air.

729
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,253
And so when you
walk into the water,

730
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,965
you don't even feel it.

731
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,678
Fiji sounds...

732
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,305
Yeah.

733
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,646
As soon as I get
a clean bill health.

734
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,982
But first, victory smokes.

735
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,987
Yeah.

736
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,449
Thanks for making
the trek to the sticks.

737
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,243
Oh,
it's not far from where I grew up.

738
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,912
My elementary school
is right around the corner.

739
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,164
Oh,
you gonna make that stop next?

740
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,917
I'm gonna wait to go with
Leslie Stahl and the camera crew

741
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,502
before the next election.

742
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,754
Maybe I'll squirt some tears

743
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,090
when I look at the jungle
gym I broke a tooth on.

744
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,175
-Hmm. I'll be sure to watch.
-Hm.

745
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,637
Came across something
that might interest you though.

746
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,015
Criminal behavior in Manhattan.

747
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,766
Is Rhoades hiding in a closet?

748
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,268
-Are you distracting me

749
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,563
while someone plants something
in the exhaust of my car?

750
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,815
Truth?

751
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,484
Chuck has no idea
I'm even doing this.

752
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,161
Your father.

753
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,704
Jesus.

754
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,124
Why?

755
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,917
I'll answer the
"what"-- price fixing.

756
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,836
The evidence is in front of you.

757
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,047
The only why I'll answer is,

758
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,341
I don't want my
fingerprints on this.

759
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,719
As to why I need this done?

760
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,095
Family shit.

761
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,015
I thank God every day
I grew up medium-poor.

762
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,517
The ones with
the Tiffany rattles

763
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,603
could never stop
warring with their own.

764
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:27,231
Hmm. You know nothing
about how I grew up.

765
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,734
Yeah, we had some money.

766
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,779
But I had to prove that I
deserved my spot in the world

767
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,489
every single day,

768
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,117
much as you did
in a different way.

769
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,994
You don't go into
the justice business

770
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,204
because it's a fair world,

771
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,248
you do it because you
want to make it one.

772
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:49,921
Yes.

773
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,464
Are you ready to make your move?

774
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,965
I already answered
your question.

775
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,300
And your people?
I don't know them.

776
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,552
-Can we trust them?
-Can we trust anybody?

777
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,971
Very few. And only
one way to find out.

778
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:00,973
My appointment's here.

779
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,767
Say hi from me.

780
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,655
My new office is only
a few blocks away,

781
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,658
but I guess you didn't
want to be seen there.

782
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,243
Congrats on the new job.

783
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,287
The second life
after Spartan-Ives.

784
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,874
You always seem
to play it tight.

785
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,751
Like that about you.

786
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,504
I might have been better
off if I kept it locked down

787
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,506
in the first place or...

788
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,967
never came back.

789
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,635
But the thing is,

790
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,929
how many ports can
you dock your yacht in

791
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,223
before you get
a little bit bored?

792
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,391
Sixty.

793
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,226
It's pretty close.

794
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,019
Feels like you
have a pitch for me.

795
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,356
But if you want to sell me,
you gotta loose your lips a little.

796
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,025
Major player,
very liquid in the cannabis space.

797
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,318
You open to that?

798
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,820
Open?

799
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,780
I'm hippy flippin' right now.

800
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:02,660
.25 G psilocybin with
1.5 mg MDMA booster.

801
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,997
So I'm most assuredly open.

802
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,082
In fact,
if this is behind Axe's back,

803
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,627
something I'd be
taking from him...

804
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,172
wide motherfucking open.

805
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,968
I thought we had
an understanding.

806
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,761
I gave you an actual order,

807
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,181
yet your father
was just arrested.

808
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,401
Don't pretend
this is news to you.

809
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,195
I told you I wouldn't
alert him. I didn't.

810
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,738
You took him off the field.

811
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,406
A minor charge,
some embarrassment,

812
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,242
no jail time,
to protect him from getting nailed

813
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,702
as a board member in on the fix.

814
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,287
Don't think that falls
under our agreement.

815
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,164
The one founded in transparency?

816
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,583
It took a little while for
that to stick on your side,

817
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,084
so I guess I'm
still catching up,

818
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,836
but that shouldn't
affect your main concern,

819
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,004
Axlerod.

820
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,506
Think of how this looks to him,
like it was your move.

821
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,509
Like you dinged my dad so
Prince would stay in the lead.

822
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,221
If this were truly a competition
over the cannabis money

823
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,097
that's exactly the
kind of throat-cutting

824
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,058
you would engage in.

825
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,227
I helped sell it.

826
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,854
You may be right.

827
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,983
But don't act like
that's why you did it.

828
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,778
We don't all enjoy sending
our fathers to the wolves.

829
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,071
We don't.

830
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,405
But we do it,

831
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,158
because we not only accomplish
whatever we were after,

832
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,328
we get the thing they wouldn't
give us any other way...

833
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,288
respect.

834
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,709
Oh, and by the way,

835
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,337
Judge DeGiulio texted
me about your brief.

836
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:40,925
Quote, "Fucking seaworthy,"
unquote. High praise.

837
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,264
Congratulations.

838
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,483
Have you still not been able
to reach Franklin Sacker?

839
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,735
Radio silence. His
office can't even find him.

840
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,487
But you do have a
message from Bach.

841
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,156
The Solicitor General has
the brief in his filing for cert.

842
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,366
He said you--

843
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,952
Yeah,
I know exactly what it means.

844
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,331
I have another
call. Mike Prince.

845
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,710
Bobby, I feel a little like
Cathy Moriarty in Raging Bull,

846
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,169
the way you keep pursuing me

847
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,171
even though you know
it's no good for you.

848
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,423
Weird way to start a call, Mike.

849
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,300
Well,
I'm expanding my perspective.

850
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,344
I-- I've heard many times about Axe,
the thought leader,

851
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,097
the man ahead of the curve,
doing his own thing.

852
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,308
I don't know if he ever existed,
but I haven't seen him.

853
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,601
The Axe I'm acquainted
with is a pirate,

854
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:36,147
or in the lingua franca of
your beloved New York streets,

855
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,690
a goniff.

856
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,985
You tried to steal
from me again.

857
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,194
It didn't work.

858
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,904
Your media advantage is gone.

859
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,741
Winslow and I have
wrapped up our negotiations.

860
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,743
And you know what
you wound up with?

861
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,370
Nothing in your
hand but moonlight.

862
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,498
I have strings attached
to all of my fingers.

863
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,875
When I yank 'em,

864
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,878
you are gonna shake,
rattle, and shit yourself.

865
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,850
So this is what the inside of
a therapist's office looks like.

866
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,268
You've never been to therapy?

867
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,686
Just fucking with you.

868
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,022
Twice a week since I was 11.

869
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,983
I love the environment,

870
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,569
like a model room
in a department store.

871
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:27,406
A focus group-tested
simulacrum of cozy comfort,

872
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,951
tasteful and personalized,
but impersonal.

873
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,162
I think this is where I
feel most comfortable.

874
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,373
-That's the idea.
-Helpful.

875
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,125
Because I have to share
some shit that's making me feel

876
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,003
seriously awk-ward,

877
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,213
awkward.

878
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,256
Yeah,
I thought that's probably what you meant.

879
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,634
I saw something
I shouldn't have.

880
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,344
And it's fucking me up.

881
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,513
Normally,
I keep that stuff to myself.

882
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,431
Oof, what I have hidden about
my mom from my grandma,

883
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,351
and then also about my
grandma from my mom.

884
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,644
Do you wanna go there?

885
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,853
I don't know. Do you?

886
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,688
I'm a trained shrink. So,
always.

887
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,192
But... I think that's not
actually what's bothering you.

888
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,529
I can't sit on this if I
wanna keep working here.

889
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,406
And I think I want
to keep working here.

890
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,117
But if I talk about it,
maybe I can't work here anyway.

891
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,952
What type of a paradox is that?

892
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,370
One that probably
only gets better

893
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,663
if you take a deep breath...

894
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,874
...and actually tell me.

895
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,876
I was in Taylor's
office dropping stuff off

896
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,796
and on their computer screen,
ugh...

897
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,006
Taylor had a meeting
with Lawrence Boyd

898
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:29,677
about a company we told
Axe to pump the brakes on.

899
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,471
Taylor went to a rival
with the opposite advice?

900
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,640
I don't wanna work in a place
with secrets, lies,

901
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,602
backstabbing,
side-stabbing, any stabbing.

902
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,396
Understandable. So I
know how best to handle this.

903
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,106
Are you confiding
it to me in session

904
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,568
or are you reporting to me
as your boss at Mase Carbon?

905
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,610
Whoa.

906
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,530
You have made your
life very complicated.

907
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,491
I'm trying to make mine
less so by offloading this.

908
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,953
So...  good
luck with all of that.

909
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,729
I would like to
have an abstract,

910
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,272
hypothetical conversation

911
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,441
about serving multiple masters.

912
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,610
No, you don't. Not with me.

913
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,236
If this were about Axe,
you would say,

914
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,696
"Axe, this is about Taylor."

915
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,532
They did something you need
to tell me without telling me.

916
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,118
I really expected that to
take a few more rounds.

917
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,953
You're not the only person
here who can solve a puzzle

918
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,705
with just one
letter on the board.

919
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,875
I know when you want a drinking
pal and when you have an agenda.

920
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,794
Taylor went behind Axe's
back to lay off the cannabis deal

921
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,338
to a third party.

922
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,048
Whoa, fuck. Who?

923
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,216
Lawrence Boyd.

924
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,176
Doubly fucked.

925
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,512
I got it from here.

926
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,555
I gotta ask you.

927
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,390
Why aren't you on the
phone with him right now?

928
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,226
-Telling him about Taylor?
-No.

929
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,686
Trying to talk him out of
taking on the cannabis money.

930
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,396
You think he needs
to be talked out of it?

931
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,650
No. I think you think he does.

932
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,571
Something's different, shifted.

933
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,324
You're not divided
between Axe and Taylor.

934
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,284
You're divided
between Axe and Axe.

935
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,453
You don't want to be the one
shouting him down anymore.

936
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,665
Trying to tell him to ignore
his instincts. Why not?

937
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,168
Because that doesn't
work with a-- a--

938
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,670
A partner?

939
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,672
I get it.

940
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,674
If you and Axe are gonna
have another kind of thing,

941
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,551
you need to make
peace with who he is

942
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,719
and stop trying to change him.

943
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,181
Is that what's going on?

944
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,267
Have you made that peace?

945
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,063
Thank you for
taking this to him.

946
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,117
Hey, Chuck.

947
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:06,917
Uh, I know that Sacker
tipped you off about her dad.

948
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,421
Now,
you had your headline and your fun.

949
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,965
You don't need to
pick up a penalty flag

950
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,050
for the fire hydrant
celebration.

951
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,178
Franklin Sacker and Axelrod.

952
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,307
Your father and Delaware.

953
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,143
It's all connected.

954
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,939
Your Jeffersonian dinner
theater was setting up a move.

955
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,484
There was no ideological fight.

956
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,903
It was masking scent on a snare.

957
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,488
You're working with Prince

958
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,198
-to bring down Axe.

959
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,325
And now what? Hmm?

960
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,410
You take this theory to him?

961
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,412
Win his eternal gratitude?

962
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,663
It'd be a real smile.

963
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,124
Oh, fun factor's high,
I'll grant you that.

964
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,167
Sky fuckin' high.

965
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,668
And I'd have him
forever in my debt.

966
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,629
-Powerful ally.
-Hmm. For sure.

967
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,923
But then you become
Mike Prince's eternal enemy.

968
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,091
Hmm. True.

969
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,217
And mine.

970
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,845
Hmm. All that power.

971
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,347
And pettiness.

972
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,973
Trained upon me.

973
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,850
Every bit of it.

974
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,810
So shoot your shot.

975
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,148
Our turf war over
criminal cases is over.

976
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,691
I surrender.

977
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,944
Like Captain Fehler
on U-boat 234.

978
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,198
From now on,
you will clear all criminal cases with me?

979
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:24,036
Yes. Provided you grant
me one imminent arrest.

980
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,706
Dawn Winslow and
where she leads.

981
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,042
Enjoy it.

982
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,254
May be the only one

983
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,382
for quite some time.

984
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,725
Your business
makes money for Axe.

985
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,268
So you won't be
put out of business.

986
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,812
There'll just be
enough locks on it

987
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,689
that you'll suffocate
if you fight too hard.

988
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,232
And who winds
up holding the key?

989
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,692
-Take a guess.
- I have to approve

990
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,111
any investment over seven figs.

991
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,487
That's every investment.

992
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,656
So I guess much
like Andy Summers,

993
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,783
I'm on top of every
move you make.

994
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,703
And you can no longer make soft
dollar arrangements on your own.

995
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,163
Those are my
relationships with other firms.

996
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,416
They're Hard Bob's
relationships too now.

997
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,043
Because they all
clear through him.

998
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,878
And what does Victor do?

999
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,172
Whatever you do.

1000
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,758
I need to explain to Axe
how these strictures--

1001
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,178
You don't talk to him.
Or see him anymore.

1002
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,265
The only face you see is mine.

1003
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,267
Mine too.

1004
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,027
We need to clear the atmosphere.

1005
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,237
Victor, give us the room.

1006
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,115
-No can.
-Give us the fucking room.

1007
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,287
Okay.

1008
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,669
We're supposed to be partners,

1009
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,254
but you freelanced
on the Boyd play.

1010
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,339
You're tracking my
schedule now? What the fuck?

1011
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,884
No. How the fuck do I
excuse your lack of trust in me?

1012
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,636
We may be looking at a
foundational question here,

1013
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,096
because are we partners?

1014
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,931
On paper,
kinda. In person, same.

1015
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,892
Sometimes you act
like it in the same way

1016
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,060
you once acted as
my shrink or my friend.

1017
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,105
But Axe really controls it all,
just like he always did.

1018
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,900
So where does that leave me?

1019
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,488
Well,
sounds like at battle stations again.

1020
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,532
Is that really what you want?

1021
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:27,951
No.

1022
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,286
Me neither.

1023
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,829
I want to believe
the best of you

1024
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,915
because that's the kind
of world I want to live in.

1025
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,834
And like it or not,
we're lashed together.

1026
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,463
So?

1027
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,467
I guess tell Victor to
set up his fucking desk.

1028
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,812
I come bearing gifts, again.

1029
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,730
Shocked you'd want
to show your face after

1030
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,274
your boss sold me
something he couldn't deliver.

1031
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,859
We've come back
to you with an offer

1032
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,778
we don't need anyone
else for. Three percent.

1033
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,155
-Interest on my money.
-The going rate at most banks

1034
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,615
right now is close to zero.

1035
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,408
You just need to
get your cash safe

1036
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,828
and in the system,
and we're offering you icing.

1037
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,498
Nice. But not enough to
walk away from Prince.

1038
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,583
Axe thought you'd say that.

1039
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,836
So there's also this.

1040
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,841
I did let my subscription to
Architectural Digest lapse.

1041
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:28,345
The house.
My country house.

1042
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,347
It is now your house.

1043
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,557
This is my offer

1044
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,808
and there's no shopping it.

1045
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,476
I want your answer right now.

1046
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,229
I wanted to give you
something personally,

1047
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,772
something that matters to me

1048
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,440
so you know the kind
of partner that I will be

1049
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,067
-for you down the road.
-You're on the water.

1050
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,319
Why do you need an
Olympic-sized indoor pool?

1051
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,405
You'll appreciate
it come October.

1052
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,906
I think I will.

1053
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,951
But I can't go through the whole
due diligence process again.

1054
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,953
Prince spent the last
few weeks digging through

1055
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,038
my entire business
and I need to be done.

1056
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,000
Just cross out Prince's name
in the deal and put mine in.

1057
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:02,880
And I will use his due
diligence as my own and sign.

1058
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,009
We have a deal.

1059
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,136
Good.

1060
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,265
Now I can get back
to more pressing business.

1061
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,944
One last how-do-you-do before
I meet Big Daddy? For luck?

1062
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,406
Hmm.

1063
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,166
Wagner!

1064
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,669
Hey there, Dad.

1065
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,087
Is it too soon?

1066
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,715
I look forward to long talks,
throwin' the ball around.

1067
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,593
Is this the man you've
been telling me about?

1068
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,887
Wags, what is going on?

1069
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,472
You two know each other?

1070
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,057
Your old man threw
down the gauntlet,

1071
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,267
had me dress up
like Carol Channing

1072
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,895
only to spit in my eye.

1073
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:45,023
I told him what I
would do in his eye.

1074
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,608
And now I have.

1075
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,904
Wagner,
you walking Special Victims Unit.

1076
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,906
You defiled my offspring.

1077
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,702
No doubt with a criminal
combination of mendacity,

1078
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,537
manipulation, and Spanish fly.

1079
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,579
Oh no.

1080
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,832
You raised a fine
piece of daughter.

1081
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,792
She knows her own mind and body.

1082
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,503
And what a live body it is.

1083
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,798
You knew he was my
father the entire time?

1084
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,883
That's what this has
always been about?

1085
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,552
The middle was real.

1086
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,430
You motherfucker.

1087
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,932
If you think my father
knows how to get revenge,

1088
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,935
you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

1089
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,688
Wait, wait. Chelz.

1090
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:31,403
I went looking in earnest
and stopped on your profile.

1091
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,906
Then I recognized your
picture and your name.

1092
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,366
Like I said,

1093
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,617
the middle was real.

1094
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,162
-Don't bother, Wagner.
-Shut up, Mick.

1095
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,748
Let him try and talk his way out of this,
Dad.

1096
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,666
It'll make it sweeter.

1097
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,461
What I felt
for you wasn't just

1098
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,336
lust.

1099
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,131
Or amusement. Or respect.

1100
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:54,051
I had to follow through
on my revenge because,

1101
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,469
well, because it's who I am.

1102
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,220
I just fuckin' had to.

1103
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,764
But it was hard.

1104
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,016
It was fantastic,

1105
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,351
but really, really hard.

1106
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,228
Because...

1107
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,149
I don't want to lose you.

1108
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,235
And if there's any way
you could see to forgive me

1109
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,696
and give us a real shot--

1110
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,865
Wagner, you're disturbed.

1111
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:20,577
Every great love story
springs from the forbidden...

1112
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,538
comes true against all
obstacles of good family

1113
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,540
and good taste because
sometimes a heart

1114
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,627
finds another heart
it needs to be with.

1115
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,757
You had me at the middle.

1116
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,036
Peach,

1117
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,580
kill the smoke detectors.

1118
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,751
I have had-- We have had

1119
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,670
so many wins.

1120
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,464
There were so many
times that I almost pulled out

1121
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,424
the Auerbachs.

1122
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,926
Glad as hell that we waited.

1123
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:21,263
Now light 'em up like you're
that goddamn Grucci family.

1124
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,517
I'm strictly forbidden
to smoke right now,

1125
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,145
but I'm gonna do it anyway.

1126
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,148
Fuck yeah!

1127
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,281
Axe swallowed it.

1128
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,783
He actually closed
on that money.

1129
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,744
Didn't do his own due diligence,
just accepted Prince's

1130
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,330
and took it down like
sushi laced with polonium.

1131
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,124
Wouldn't have happened
without the efforts

1132
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,959
of everyone in this room.

1133
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,044
Or without great personal cost.

1134
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,714
As all great triumphs require.

1135
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,091
Liz and Gail are here.

1136
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,218
They're coming up
in the private elevator.

1137
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,429
I pray that when they
know what I've done,

1138
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,930
that they'll understand.

1139
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,473
We should go anyway.

1140
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,975
Time to arrest Winslow.

1141
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,477
A legal cannabis seller cannot
make up for seasonal shortfall

1142
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,939
by adding in a black-market
crop of Humboldt County

1143
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,232
with the legit stuff.

1144
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,151
You've combed through
all the possibilities.

1145
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,736
Looked into every
legal cannabis company

1146
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,988
until you found the one
CEO who also happened

1147
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,740
to be running a
criminal enterprise.

1148
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,700
She's no longer a
business pioneer.

1149
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,536
Just another drug dealer
moving major weight.

1150
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,789
I'm betting she won't hold
up long before flipping on Axe.

1151
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,291
I'll leave with you.

1152
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,252
In the name of decorum,
let me show you the regular elevators.

1153
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,399
So have the contracts
been signed yet?

1154
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,152
We didn't land the deal.

1155
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,906
Winslow went with
Bobby Axelrod's bank.

1156
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,116
Shit.

1157
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,202
Sorry,
Dad. I thought we did really well.

1158
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,787
Is it done-done? I mean,
can we call

1159
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,205
and ask her for another meeting?

1160
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,082
That's exactly
the right attitude.

1161
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,584
Never quit. Never
take no for an answer.

1162
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,753
Remember that.

1163
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,259
Actually, no,
I can't. I won't lie to you.

1164
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:27,305
This all worked out
exactly how I knew it would.

1165
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,849
Wait, what?

1166
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,393
You wanted to lose?

1167
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:34,020
I needed Bobby
Axelrod to win the deal.

1168
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,105
To bank the money.

1169
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,731
You used us?

1170
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,650
To what? Like, bait him in?

1171
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,026
Gail, he didn't do that.

1172
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,987
You didn't do that.

1173
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,116
Wait, one sec.

1174
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,868
Why did you want Axelrod to win?

1175
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,453
So he'd go to jail.

1176
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,956
Because that's also
where Winslow's going.

1177
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,083
Believe me when I tell you,

1178
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,418
Mike Prince and his daughters

1179
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,503
made the world a
better place today.

1180
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,713
You played us.

1181
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,298
Dangled us out
there like assholes--

1182
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,758
Hey,
you wanted to know what it felt like.

1183
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,176
And come on,
you took one meeting.

1184
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,012
We practiced
our pitch all night.

1185
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,430
Well, you got some experience.

1186
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,266
Maybe rethink Europe,
the JetBlue version, if you want.

1187
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,517
Save it, Dad.

1188
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,561
We're starting to know
what your old partner

1189
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,729
must have felt like--

1190
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,314
Hey, that crap is over the line.

1191
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,274
This is business.
This is what not having

1192
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,775
a soft landing feels like.

1193
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,360
You tear your butt
when you hit the ground.

1194
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,362
We didn't even
have a chance to win.

1195
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,657
Yeah. This time the odds
were stacked against you.

1196
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,242
Just like you said you wanted.

1197
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:32,037
Now you haven't
been robbed of it.

1198
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,872
But, uh,

1199
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,166
next time you'll do better.

1200
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,126
I don't like this.

1201
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,879
Or your face right now, Dad.

1202
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,464
Yeah. This sucks.

1203
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:46,676
Yeah, Mike Prince,
you are kind of sucking right now.

1204
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,190
You know they roll
them on their thighs,

1205
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,608
slow and steady.

1206
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,736
The sweat intermingles,
which gives it a distinct--

1207
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,279
I can't decide if that makes it

1208
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,323
more or less appealing.

1209
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,617
I think less,
but I want to think more.

1210
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,538
I'm not much for group gropes
but I'll smoke one with you.

1211
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,931
You should join the party.

1212
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,767
Heard that a lot
of times in my life.

1213
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,604
Thank you for what you did.

1214
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,689
I know you were scared
to go to Wendy like that.

1215
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,608
-But we needed it.
-Hmm.

1216
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,694
Maybe the most exhilarating
moment of my life.

1217
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:52,450
That and when I found a
Tamagotchi emulator, oof.

1218
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,833
God,
it just feels like old times.

1219
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,293
You know,
there's been so much shit,

1220
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,920
so much bad blood.

1221
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,755
-But a pure win like this,

1222
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,924
after all we've been through?

1223
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,093
Fuck, I miss these days.

1224
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,596
The estimable Zino
Davidoff once said,

1225
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,015
"A cigar ought not
to be smoked solely

1226
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:18,893
with the mouth,
but with the hand,

1227
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,271
with the eyes, with the spirit.

1228
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,814
Oh, Jesus.

1229
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:23,898
Wow.

1230
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,733
I believe a good
cigar and glass of wine

1231
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,235
and a good conversation

1232
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:30,447
is as close to euphoria
as one can get.

1233
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,323
In a legal sense.

1234
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,992
Davidoff again?

1235
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,201
Sly Stallone.

1236
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,745
Are these
going to your head?

1237
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,289
They're going to my head.

1238
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,124
You're smoking a little fast.

1239
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,709
I'm excited.

1240
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,544
Douse the fucking smokes.

1241
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,129
Now!

1242
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,048
Get Axe up on the screen, now!

1243
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,091
You got it.

1244
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,928
You know who I am

1245
00:57:56,556 --> 00:58:00,518
You know I can't let you

1246
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:07,150
Slide through my hands...

1247
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,152
Dawn Winslow
was just arrested.

1248
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,821
Criminal drug trafficking.
They're coming for you next.

1249
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,448
How me? It's gonna be legal.

1250
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,034
Uh-uh. What she
was selling wasn't.

1251
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,827
Fuck!

1252
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,246
If she goes down for that,
and you bank the resulting money,

1253
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,623
you are on the hook.

1254
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,749
Specifics?

1255
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,501
According to my guy,
sometime in the next 24 hours

1256
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,252
they believe they'll
have you in custody,

1257
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,589
and they don't believe you
have a way out this time.

1258
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,050
Just give the order and we move.

1259
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,176
On your command.

1260
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,054
Couldn't drag me away

1261
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:42,560
I watched you suffer..

1262
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,022
What do you want us to do?

1263
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,192
A dull aching pain...

1264
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,573
I have no fucking idea.

1265
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:02,080
To show me the same

1266
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:11,005
No sweeping exits

1267
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:17,554
Or offstage lines

1268
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:24,060
Could make me feel bitter

1268
00:59:25,305 --> 01:00:25,242
