1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,171
The city's down. It's a
perfect opportunity to rebuild.

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,007
All of this is some
big romantic gesture?

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,050
I think we should both
proceed with caution.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,761
I came here to hire you.

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,263
There's a war going on,

6
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,265
between the very wealth
you are trying to accrue

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,727
and the rest of us. The
stakes are absolute.

8
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,562
New Yorkers will be
riding in style in time

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,689
for the 2028 games.

10
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,025
And you'll be the hero
to take them there.

11
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,527
No. The governor
of New York will be.

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,821
Isn't this getting too
expensive to be worth it?

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,698
Not until the torch
is lit in Manhattan.

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,241
After we eat,
it's off to Palazzo

15
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,076
with our soft targets.

16
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,703
The place is loaded with talent.

17
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,455
Thank you for taking
the time to see--

18
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,708
There's no money
without the cars.

19
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,877
No but you did
promise it to the MTA.

20
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,587
We'll make an
undirected donation

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,714
of two billion dollars to
the MTA tomorrow morning.

22
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,424
Without a source
close to Prince,

23
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,385
you'll just be guessing
blind at his attacks.

24
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,095
You can get me
the names of the contenders

25
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,889
for Prince's list.

26
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,309
MPC,
meet the final piece of the Prince List.

27
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,727
Indiana A&M.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

29
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,599
Are you leaving?

30
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,727
Why?

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,606
You down for another round?

32
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,288
Oh, you so want to.

33
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,415
But you haven't allowed
yourself a free morning

34
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,043
since junior high,
and now you're stuck.

35
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,548
Stay. For breakfast.

36
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,593
Okay. It won't just
be the two of us--

37
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,805
I--I could use your help.

38
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,141
And your charm.

39
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,769
Colin Drache is coming
over for a meeting.

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,104
He's gonna get us
primed for the final vote

41
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
at the end of the week.

42
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,108
He's gonna want his palms greased,
that guy.

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,527
I have a workaround.

44
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,530
You think he keeps
himself in Brunello Cucinelli

45
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,532
taking "workarounds"
instead of fat envelopes?

46
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,159
That's why you need to be there.

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,702
I can't let him get me
like Napoleon's hat,

48
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,203
two corners.

49
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,539
With you there,
he can't ask for a payoff.

50
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,465
I love New York. Who doesn't?

51
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,217
It's a fine city.

52
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,052
It's a fine slogan.

53
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,056
But even the most fervent
amoureux de New York

54
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,602
would have to concede,
your public transportation

55
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,020
is an insult

56
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,023
to both the public
and transportation.

57
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,816
No. If you go by what exists right now,
sure.

58
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,610
But by the time the
games are here--

59
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,863
Let me guess. Your trains will
be as speedy as Monfils himself

60
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,657
and won't smell like
liquefied humanity.

61
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,326
I'm meeting with the MTA later

62
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,535
to sell them on
a brighter future.

63
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,870
I've got a lead engineer

64
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,538
and private
funding all lined up.

65
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,706
It's as good as done.

66
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,541
There's a deadline.

67
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,710
You'll get an agreement
within the next three days?

68
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,296
Yep. Just in time for
every Commission member

69
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,632
to write those
grand three letters,

70
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,217
"NYC," on their ballots.

71
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,260
I've seen the
subway plans myself.

72
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,888
Excellent. There remains
one matter to be discussed.

73
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,765
A delicate one...

74
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,225
which we could
address if we were...

75
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,394
a bit more like un
chapeau de Napoleon.

76
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,396
Perhaps I could return or...

77
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,524
Oh. Oh, no,
there's no need for a return visit.

78
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,993
This outlines an initiative
I'm funding with Indiana A&M

79
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,454
seeking a greater level
of international diversity.

80
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,665
It allows certain
members of the ICS

81
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,708
to select which kids
in their community--

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,919
deserving kids--
get the scholarships.

83
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,338
Now,
the school will have final approval,

84
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,383
but it'll make some of
your commissioners heroes.

85
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,343
And do a lot of good
around the world.

86
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,057
I've got a C.I. stuck
into the Prince List.

87
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,352
Stuart Legere,
President of Indiana A&M.

88
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,604
I got a call from
him on my way in.

89
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,898
Prince is offering scholarships

90
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,733
like a Pez dispenser.

91
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,861
Scholarships are
a bad thing now?

92
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,571
We've gotta talk scholarships.

93
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,116
- All above board.

94
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,285
- You want to think so.
- What are you worried about?

95
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,287
He's giving them to members
of the Olympic Commission

96
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,289
- to use as leverage--
- That's mom's apple pie

97
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,125
compared to what usually
happens in the grapple for the games.

98
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,252
Chuck's gonna go after them.

99
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,837
- Oh, come on--
- I'm telling you.

100
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,630
Let me coordinate
with Indiana A&M,

101
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,590
help them language their
announcement so it's clear

102
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,342
they were seeking
these students.

103
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,844
And with the recipients,
make sure they declare

104
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,345
the scholarships on their taxes.

105
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,639
There's merely
been an introduction,

106
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,391
a connection made.

107
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,351
That's a level of care
beyond legal due diligence.

108
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,853
Which is what we need,

109
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,146
because Chuck is
going to go after them.

110
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,689
My guess is,

111
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,150
somewhere inside this
is a direct bribe of sorts,

112
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,818
a quid pro quo.

113
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,820
I sometimes think I'm a good guesser,
too.

114
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,739
Like when Howard Stern
used to have the Rosie head

115
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,408
filled with jelly beans. But
no matter how sure I was,

116
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,077
- I never got it right.
- That they became friends

117
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,163
is one of the great
shocks of my lifetime.

118
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,497
It's wonderful.

119
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,665
But these scholarships are not.

120
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,584
My nose never lies.

121
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,753
It's like that toucan in
the Froot Loops ads.

122
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,588
And I smell something.

123
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,757
You hired me to
anticipate Chuck's moves.

124
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,592
If he finds out about this,

125
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,177
he's gonna try to make
it look real look bad.

126
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,970
The Olympic announcement
is in three days.

127
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,514
He will see this deadline
as putting pressure on you

128
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,433
to shore up the bid.

129
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,185
And Chuck Rhoades thinks
that any wealthy plunger

130
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,978
in a tight spot
pays his way out.

131
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,646
That guy.

132
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,315
A Cypress Hill
song comes to mind.

133
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,317
I can't picture you
listening to that.

134
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,943
Lot of years in
basketball locker rooms.

135
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,987
Raps along,
but never says the curse words.

136
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,656
So we need to only talk
about every part of that,

137
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,824
or never speak of it again.

138
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,159
I choose "B." So...

139
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,161
The harbor is mined here.

140
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,788
We do it right,
we sail through to dry land.

141
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,998
We do it wrong, bang.

142
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,834
Good. Thank you, Kate.

143
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,717
You pay her to lock it down.

144
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,636
You pay me to make it work.

145
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,722
These scholarships will be
99.4% pure when she's done.

146
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,391
But even that Ivory Snow

147
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,892
might not be enough
to bring this home.

148
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,561
Salt Lake City lost
the '98 Winter Games

149
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,563
because they were
giving out saltwater taffy

150
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,732
while Nagano was
comping resort vacations.

151
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,734
We're playing with a
boa constrictor here.

152
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,861
We don't get away
without being squeezed.

153
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,863
The games are part
of my long-term plans

154
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,323
for myself and this city.

155
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,200
But I have an angle.

156
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,827
The Olympics are under pressure

157
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,329
to move past the
sordid reputation.

158
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,374
I'm the guy offering to
usher them into a new age,

159
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,000
a fully respectable one.

160
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,920
My gut is that
they're not looking for

161
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,923
free sushi dinners and
massages this go-round.

162
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,134
Maybe they just want
to camouflage it better.

163
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,886
Nah, I saw Colin's face
when I handed him that folder.

164
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,638
It was exactly what
he was looking for.

165
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,723
No one puts on a read better than you,
Mike.

166
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,268
But do you want to
be the first person

167
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,978
who really tried to get the
games to New York City

168
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,688
with no grease?

169
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,898
Or the person who got the
games to New York City?

170
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,948
Hi.

171
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,700
That event tonight
at Kevin's school...

172
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,577
- I forgot all about it.
-  Tonight?

173
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,413
I missed it entirely.
My mistake.

174
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,957
What,
are they accepting donations of valuables

175
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,750
now that they've cleaned
out our bank account?

176
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,545
Just as painful.
Carnival fundraiser.

177
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,047
They have us down as
volunteers to work the booths.

178
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,632
That implies we were willing.

179
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,967
Neither of us has attended

180
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,302
a Parent Association
meeting this year.

181
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,636
I'm guessing they
wouldn't accept

182
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,305
a paralegal in our stead?

183
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,807
Not if we want to
remain in good standing.

184
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,018
Kevin's gonna be
applying to colleges soon.

185
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,436
And if you can't
get him into Yale,

186
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,937
we're gonna need
them to jam him into--

187
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,564
Don't say Cornell.

188
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,941
I was hoping you could
take one for the team.

189
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,568
I would. I will.

190
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,153
Next time. Work is--

191
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,697
I'm asking for a favor, Chuck.

192
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,073
Which I would
love to do for you.

193
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,366
Hell, at next year's carnival,

194
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,701
I'll do the dunk tank,

195
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,369
and I'll let you
take the first shot.

196
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,038
I just don't think I can
make it happen right now.

197
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,080
Hmm.

198
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,668
Ten
times the efficiency.

199
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,629
Zero accidents. Zero delays.

200
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,088
Easier said than built.

201
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,715
Only slightly so for Ms. Reddy.

202
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,343
She's put the full force
of her engineering genius

203
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,969
and her network
building experience

204
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,804
into complete signal overhaul.

205
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,681
I've already designed
the routing systems

206
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,391
and run simulated tests.

207
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,018
This will save lives

208
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,520
and lots of money
in the long term.

209
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,869
Mayor Johnson.

210
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,246
I didn't know you'd
be joining us today.

211
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,372
Would've waited if I had.

212
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,796
Since you couldn't
buy us a new subway,

213
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,257
I wanna hear how Mike
Prince plans to save

214
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,299
the subway we've got.

215
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,105
Two words:

216
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,856
Olympic Express.

217
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,485
An express train service to
and from Olympic venues.

218
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,697
It'll incentivize more
tourists to use mass transit,

219
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,699
and, with the higher fares,
it will be a major

220
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,534
revenue generator for the MTA.

221
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,954
I love to walk down Fifth
Avenue and window shop.

222
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,666
It's fun to imagine wearing
all those pretty things.

223
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,543
But as soon as you
step inside the store

224
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,420
and flip over that price tag,

225
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,380
the illusion is broken.

226
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,091
I'm stepping inside the
store this budget cycle,

227
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,927
coordinating closely
with all city agencies.

228
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,763
I'm sorry, Mike,
we just can't afford luxury items.

229
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,432
Well, that's the best part.

230
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,434
Won't cost the
city a thing. Nada.

231
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,936
I have commitments
from prominent financiers,

232
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,188
including Sruthi,
to provide all the funding.

233
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,733
- Every cent.
- Yeah, sure.

234
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,193
We might as well
build a private train

235
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,530
just for Mr. Michael
Prince while we're at it.

236
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,282
There's nothing but
upside for the MTA on this.

237
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,868
Nothing in this city comes free.

238
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,078
Sorry, Mike, we don't need you.

239
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,123
We don't want to be
indebted to private investors.

240
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,916
We're floating
public transpo bonds

241
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,627
to raise the funds
the MTA needs.

242
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,171
You want to see the
Olympics come to New York.

243
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,672
I know you do.

244
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,008
I can't be seen
doing your bidding.

245
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,593
Not this term.

246
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,970
Especially after all that
drama with Rhoades.

247
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,473
I was standing up there
being shouted at, too.

248
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,849
By voters.

249
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,519
Cute idea,
though. Olympic Express.

250
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
Maybe for 2036.

251
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,986
Well, that's that.

252
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,488
Not over. Stand by.

253
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,156
Your company will be
wiring signals by next week,

254
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,824
one way or another.

255
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,287
I'm just looking for a little
courtesy here, Nadine,

256
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,332
between our offices
on interstate fraud.

257
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,584
No,
New York did not "steal" anything.

258
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,461
And for the record,

259
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,421
I was trying to help.

260
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,007
I was the one behind
the Boss and Bon Jovi

261
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,759
playing that show.

262
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,595
Don't lose faith,
New Jersey's still in the hunt.

263
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,888
Stand by.

264
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,351
New Jersey AG.

265
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,560
Her governor's pissed 'cause

266
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,020
New York snaked the Olympic bid.

267
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,689
But it hasn't even
been announced.

268
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,692
I'm aware. But there
have been whispers.

269
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,195
I had the whole thing tilted
their way and not Prince's.

270
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,573
Something happened that
night that overshadowed the show

271
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,701
and put New York
back in the lead.

272
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,160
That's where we
need to be looking.

273
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,037
- Karl!
- Reporting.

274
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,081
Work with Dave to get
me the chopper manifests

275
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,709
from the night the advance
team flew to the Stone Pony.

276
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,545
I need to know everyone
on board to and fro.

277
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,422
I remember the days you
didn't have to take roll call

278
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,715
in a whirlybird.

279
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,299
Now that I think about it,

280
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,968
things have changed
for the better.

281
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,219
Haircuts haven't.

282
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,554
Beer neither.

283
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,056
But, yeah, some things.

284
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,307
I'll go get started.

285
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,770
And maybe you should get
back on those scholarships.

286
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,238
I'm here to catch
flagrant law-breakers.

287
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,198
I'm good with that.

288
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,411
But I can't go in on
hunting an upstanding guy

289
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,330
sticking the tips of his
Purple Labels over the line.

290
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,582
There is another kind,

291
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,876
besides the flagrant
and the line-toer,

292
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,545
and that is one who believes
there is no line for him.

293
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,213
Because his stature,

294
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,424
because his wealth,
gives him the divine right.

295
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,884
And you think
that's Mike Prince?

296
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,969
- It is.
- If you're going after him

297
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,721
because his ego is too big,

298
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,724
everyone who lives north
of 14th Street is guilty of that.

299
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,100
Maybe the whole damn island.

300
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,769
Look, it seems like

301
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,771
you want to prosecute the idea

302
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,731
of this kind of wealth itself.

303
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,650
But the courts don't offer
a cause of action for that.

304
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,943
They oughta.

305
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,361
You say that

306
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,781
because you are from it.

307
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,783
Only those with wealth

308
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,534
have the privilege
of resenting it.

309
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,579
But, for the rest of us,

310
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,248
it's that dream that
makes things go.

311
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,875
Innovation. Industry.

312
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,212
The life-changing fortune
that comes along with it.

313
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,297
You're telling me you
didn't raise your kids

314
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,799
to aspire to more?

315
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,635
I've certainly raised
mine that way.

316
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,304
Part of why I took the
shortest maternity leave

317
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,306
on record at the
defender's office.

318
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,891
That American myth

319
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,269
is just as sweet as
an ice-cold Coke,

320
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,897
and it's been guzzled down
by folks on the lower rungs

321
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,899
who don't want to tax the rich

322
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,401
because they think they'll be
that rich themselves someday.

323
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,362
And tell me you don't hope
your kids spend more time

324
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,947
with theirs than you did.

325
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,323
I want them to have it all.

326
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,367
Only guys
like Prince get that.

327
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,994
People like him,

328
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,664
who accumulate such
outsized power and lucre,

329
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,166
threaten the very thing that
makes America truly great,

330
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,835
democracy.

331
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,878
An equal voice for all.

332
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,798
That is a crime
in and of itself.

333
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,300
I'm aware of exactly where

334
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,511
the American Dream falls short,
believe me.

335
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,221
But we're not about to flip

336
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,431
an entire system of
wealth and privilege

337
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,183
by netting one Mike Prince.

338
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,146
Just promise me. If
we get to the end of this

339
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,523
and there's no crime,

340
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,191
we move on to
some real criminals.

341
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,484
I'll do you one better.

342
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,069
I'll let you pick
the next target.

343
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,331
I'll look for a lever to move
the Transport Workers Union

344
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,666
to get them to pressure
the MTA Board.

345
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,334
No, no more of that.

346
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,044
The Board isn't the issue,
Mayor Johnson is.

347
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,213
They were with us
till she walked in.

348
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,299
But she's all cashed up
for subway improvements

349
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,550
from a new bond issuance.

350
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,344
Then what do we offer her?

351
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,096
She couldn't handle the
political heat from Rhoades

352
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,348
and his Godzilla routine.
She said as much.

353
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,058
Then you need to
make it hotter for her

354
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,185
to stand against the
Olympics rather than for them.

355
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,186
Yep.

356
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,608
I'll take the Skyway, you know?

357
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,068
High above the little one-way,
sure.

358
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,695
Yeah. Good.

359
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,906
I'll set up a Zoom
with those fine folks.

360
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,661
I've looked at them all,
Chuck. All legit.

361
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,122
And, honestly,
some pretty deserving kids

362
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,749
are gonna get to go to college.

363
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,584
College will be better for it,
too.

364
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,419
Proud we are of all of them.

365
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,254
My old firm had a
digger on payroll.

366
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,340
I asked him to look into
Prince and the Olympics.

367
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,342
He found no evidence
of illegal activity

368
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,551
- in connection with the bid.
- Yet.

369
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,053
He hasn't found it--

370
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,095
You wanna
make a man dance?

371
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,889
Hit him with a subpoena.

372
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,433
You should've seen the
guy at Sky Star Aviation

373
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,435
scramble to get
me these manifests

374
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,187
once I showed him the stamp.

375
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,189
Michael Prince, not on board.

376
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,942
Scooter Dunbar was listed,
but also didn't fly.

377
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,902
The rest was
Commish advance team,

378
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,572
except for Wagner
and one Colin Drache.

379
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,407
Michael Wagner.

380
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,785
The Captain Trips for this
merry band of pranksters.

381
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,621
I made a great spirit
guide in my salad days.

382
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,666
Loose,
breathable clothing is key.

383
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,960
Wagner was the only
Prince employee on board.

384
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,837
Your bloodhound doesn't
know how men like Prince think.

385
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,922
I do.

386
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,840
He's insulated himself.

387
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,093
Prince only would've sent
someone like Michael Wagner

388
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,552
in his stead for one reason.

389
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,638
Wagner carries the black bag.

390
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,682
The man wears decorative rings,
for Christ sake.

391
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,059
We really can't jump
to legal conclusions

392
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,978
- based on accessories.
- Oh, yeah, we can.

393
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,230
Karl,
find out who this Colin Drache is.

394
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,273
We're off to a meeting
across the river.

395
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,448
You shouldn't have
shit-canned Lauren.

396
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,659
- Come again?
- That came out wrong.

397
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,077
That's not what I meant.

398
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,162
We need an IR person.
We need something.

399
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,164
Every time there's
a ratings change,

400
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,126
our switchboard lights up with
calls from panicky investors.

401
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,669
Not our actual switchboard,
which we don't have,

402
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,462
- but like our metaphoric one.
- I get you.

403
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,132
Using the ratings to punch
holes in our investment theories.

404
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,592
Like sick people using WebMD
to second-guess their doctor.

405
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,511
More like people using
Moody's to bust my ball--

406
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,013
Surely you can handle that.

407
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,973
I can handle drunk
Gerard Butler wannabes

408
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,224
nudging up against me at Minnows

409
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,892
with their Fiddlehead IPAs.

410
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,769
Doesn't mean I want to
waste my time on them.

411
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,813
Rankin's releasing a slew
of upgrades and downgrades

412
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,148
later this week.

413
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,191
Sure to bring a fresh onslaught.

414
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,152
Maybe there's a way to
preempt these kinds of calls.

415
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,070
Establish our own
ratings criteria.

416
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,613
Cool idea, but...

417
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,449
I don't even have nights
and weekends as it is.

418
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,909
Yeah. That would involve
hundreds of hours of analysis.

419
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,369
We could crowdsource it.

420
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,840
Hey.

421
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,925
Tight-lipped
bunch in that place.

422
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:32,968
I got the bartender talking.

423
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,720
How?

424
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,223
I recognized the tattoo artist
who did a piece on his neck.

425
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,476
Learned that trick last
time I was a prosecutor.

426
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,019
So what did we get?

427
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,395
He heard some of
the foreigners saying

428
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,855
their next stop
was "The Palazzo."

429
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,857
Palazzo.

430
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,317
High-end cathouse.

431
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,152
Or it was. They shut
down during COVID.

432
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,320
I thought they never reopened.

433
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,529
You missed the email blast?

434
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,032
Well, let's go. Where is it?

435
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,075
You're asking me?

436
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,534
Hey, I'm not judging,

437
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,453
but you're the
Overton Window guy,

438
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,704
so I figured--

439
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,539
No, no, I'm outta that game.

440
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,541
So we have to find Palazzo.

441
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,751
Yep.

442
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,002
It's our Fleur de Lis.

443
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,137
I think I know how to
solve the MTA issue.

444
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,680
A move has been made.

445
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,765
Is it going to work?

446
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,435
Let's go see Prince.

447
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,688
Maybe we wait a beat on that,

448
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,107
until after I make my play.

449
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,321
Ms. Mayor,
call for comment from the Post.

450
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,906
Seems Mike Prince
is in talks to sell

451
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,533
that new subway
tech to Minneapolis.

452
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,243
Minneapolis doesn't
even have a goddamn--

453
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,286
Headlines are gonna
murder you for passing on it.

454
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,621
"It's A Twin Pity,

455
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,790
NYC Loses Out
Thanks to Her Honor."

456
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,250
And so forth.

457
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,793
Get Mike Prince
on the phone for me.

458
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,592
No glory in helming

459
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,969
a third-generation
family business,

460
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,220
I'll tell you that. None.

461
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,721
Sure, my name's on the door,

462
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,349
but if I make money,
it's expected.

463
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,185
Everyone in the clan has their
hand out waiting to be filled,

464
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,645
so I can only fuck
it up from there,

465
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,105
which makes me ornery.

466
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,357
Someone with very little
to lose when it comes

467
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,443
to tangling with
a new competitor.

468
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,445
I like the direct threat thing.

469
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,947
You don't see it so much anymore

470
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,699
except from guys like you.

471
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,159
It's bracing. I'd love
you to go further.

472
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,495
To put it bluntly,
you'll wake me up.

473
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,581
You have.

474
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,500
You don't make enemies
of the well-entrenched.

475
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,628
Even if you win,
the cost is too great.

476
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,714
Plus, you'll embarrass yourself.

477
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,257
We're an institution.

478
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,009
We have expertise, track record,

479
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,385
client relationships.

480
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,470
You issue one inaccurate rating,

481
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,265
some errant data point,

482
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,350
and you lose all credibility.

483
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,935
As an investor, too.

484
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,813
So let me buy your crowd
sourcing algorithm from you,

485
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,274
salvage whatever I can.

486
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,027
That was a quick
zip around the corner

487
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,695
from Extortion
Ave to Payoff Lane.

488
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,990
You'll walk away with
your reputation intact,

489
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,366
a little change in your pocket.

490
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,328
You see your track
record as an advantage?

491
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,996
You haven't upgraded
your system since

492
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,706
Nelly came out with
Country Grammar in 2000.

493
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,167
Not even after you
rated subprimes triple-A

494
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,002
during the housing
bubble. None of you did.

495
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,671
The beauty of my algo is
that it's extracurricular for me

496
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,465
and very low-cost to operate.

497
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,300
Say you're right,
and there's a glitch.

498
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,885
No, several.

499
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,012
We can weather them
until we prove ourselves

500
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,430
and outperform you.

501
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,182
Besides,
I have another offer already.

502
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,892
And like you said,
it might make sense to sell,

503
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,769
given the hats I already wear.

504
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,895
"Offer"?

505
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,731
Shit.

506
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,900
- Standard & Poor's?
- I can't say.

507
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,194
Look, my main reason
for starting this is accuracy.

508
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,695
Whoever actually runs the thing.

509
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,032
I'll match, no,
better their offer.

510
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,245
Sure, I'll let you.

511
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,788
Because, much like your family,

512
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,665
I'm interested in
seeing you do better.

513
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,419
Thank you, Taylor,
this is the right--

514
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,964
But I need to make sure
that certain city issuances

515
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,341
of certain city
authorities are examined

516
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,592
and rated accurately,

517
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,052
low as that might be.

518
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,012
That's more
old school than--

519
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,681
You're old school as
a barbershop quartet.

520
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,557
Your hairstyle alone
could make this happen.

521
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,060
Otherwise,
I put you out of business,

522
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,688
and you can explain that
to folks at the next reunion.

523
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,792
What do you say, guys? Hmm?

524
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,634
You came.

525
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,971
I said I'd try. As did you.

526
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,890
Now I guess they've
assigned us to work together.

527
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,727
I guess they did.

528
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,939
Well, uh,
much as I appreciate the backup,

529
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,191
I think I've got the bobbing
for apples under control.

530
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,777
Fresh water and apples
for each contestant.

531
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,822
Sanitized bucket.
Feel free to take off.

532
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,454
And suffer the
disapproving glares

533
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,331
of the coven of PTA
moms as I leave?

534
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,749
Fat chance.

535
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,167
I'm sticking it out.

536
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,002
I think one of them
hexed me on the way in

537
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,046
when she found
out I didn't RSVP.

538
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,592
- No takers yet?
- Not a one.

539
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,677
It's a dreadful game, really.

540
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,097
Your face submerged,
inhaling water.

541
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,682
I'd never equate the two,

542
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,184
but it's not unlike
waterboarding,

543
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,518
I'll tell you that
from experience.

544
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,646
Oh,
it's a story for another time.

545
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,023
Rhoades.

546
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,067
Taking a break from
your billionaire bashing

547
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,568
to turn this place commie, too?

548
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,071
Save it for the ballot box, sir.

549
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,322
I want to get into it now.

550
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,698
No,

551
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,868
you walking inferiority complex.

552
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,411
Why don't you do us all a favor

553
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,372
and go find yourself
a therapist instead of

554
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,915
picking fights with greater men?

555
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,376
Unless you want him to
drag you for paying your nanny

556
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,502
and housekeeper off the books--

557
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,087
Shut the fuck up, Karen.

558
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,673
Ohh, pal,
that is a line you do not want to cross,

559
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,093
unless you want to end up
like Andy "The Hawk" Price,

560
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,594
knocked out standing
by Sugar Ray.

561
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,187
Thanks for getting my back.

562
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,689
- We struck a nerve.
- Yeah.

563
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,234
I think it was the
combo of a smug smile

564
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,069
and boat shoes.

565
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,654
There's a lotta those around here,
unfortunately.

566
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,073
The year Sperrys
or a Vineyard Vines

567
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,741
blazer shows up on
Kevin's Christmas list

568
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,160
is the year we transfer
him to public school.

569
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,913
Mm-hmm. Should we
have that convo again?

570
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,249
We always said we'd revisit
it if there were good reason.

571
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,459
We'll think on it...

572
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,295
but probably, yes.

573
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,020
- Mike.
- Hi.

574
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,480
Uh... come in.

575
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,277
I don't want to jinx it,
but I have reason to believe

576
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,571
things are looking good
for the games right now.

577
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,072
The mayor called me for a meet.

578
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,240
In person.

579
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,867
Only one reason for that call.

580
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,661
Kickass,
Michael Prince. Nicely done.

581
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,621
I had Skyline flown
in from Cincinnati,

582
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,707
a celebratory
four-way and five-way.

583
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,292
You're still the only
Midwesterner I know

584
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,043
- who can handle it.
- You know I can,

585
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,462
but I have dinner plans
that I can't get out of.

586
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,966
Oh,
no sweat. I-I should have checked.

587
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,802
You're still coming to the
announcement event though, yeah?

588
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,762
Of course. That's the
whole reason I'm here.

589
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,139
Good.

590
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,640
Win or lose,
I want you by my side.

591
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,478
What's up?

592
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,605
It's been nice,

593
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,190
being here and seeing
more of each other.

594
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,487
And there's a small part of me
that wanted New York to lose,

595
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,531
for the games to go to
Prague or Mexico City.

596
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,159
So you could challenge
yourself on another nation's soil,

597
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,660
no home field advantage?

598
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,454
No.

599
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,581
To see if you'd
put in the effort.

600
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,667
I need to be training at
altitude in the mountains.

601
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,962
Would you pull yourself
away from your company,

602
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,590
fly to me on a Friday night?

603
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,510
Make calls and dial into
meetings from my base camp?

604
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,806
Now that it's so convenient,
we'll never really know.

605
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,476
Well that's the point
of having your own jet, right?

606
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,895
The freedom to
commit to what you love.

607
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,355
I'd bring the hotspot,

608
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,482
the sat phone, whatever it took.

609
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,485
But we're lucky we don't have
to deal with that added strain.

610
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,363
We get the best of
both worlds this way.

611
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,740
Okay. Good.

612
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,953
I'm gonna finish getting
ready. I'll see you at the thing.

613
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,183
Fortune favored me tonight
at the silent auction table.

614
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,102
I'm surprised you
bid on something.

615
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,145
Only under great duress.

616
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,357
A dinner at home for two
by Chef Daniel Boulud.

617
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,109
Nicely done.

618
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,860
I'm sure it'll be exquisite.

619
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,447
Well, uh, actually,

620
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,325
I don't have a special
someone to share it with

621
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,661
at this juncture.

622
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,372
And I can't face asking
Ira or my dad to join me.

623
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,543
Why don't you take it?

624
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,878
Yeah, make a special night
of it for you and a friend.

625
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,426
I--I don't really have
anyone to ask either,

626
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,427
at the moment.

627
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,639
Huh.

628
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,769
Why don't we enjoy it together,

629
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,438
at the house?

630
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,233
It's a fine idea.

631
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,443
Check my calendar.

632
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,578
I am
damned if I work too closely

633
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,622
with billionaires and damned
if I don't work closely enough.

634
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,998
It's a tough spot.

635
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,125
The headlines haven't been kind.

636
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,627
And now you're also
saddled with every

637
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,170
subway delay and malfunction.

638
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,838
If I can be blamed for
the subway's failures,

639
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,257
I plan on taking credit for its success,
too.

640
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,634
Which is why you're here.

641
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,968
It is.

642
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,304
I'm here to tell you that

643
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,724
we don't need any money from
you or your "steering committee."

644
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,811
And even if you shower
Minneapolis with your gifts,

645
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,356
we have a subway upgrade
plan of our own in place.

646
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,358
That's not what you
said on the phone

647
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,776
when you begged
for this meeting.

648
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,944
Because I hadn't
explained my situation

649
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,321
to the governor yet.

650
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,281
But it seems he
recently fell into

651
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,992
two billion in unexpected cash.

652
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,078
A kind donation from a generous,

653
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,954
civic-minded individual.

654
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,832
And Sweeney's diverting
it to the MTA's budget.

655
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,335
With that and the new bond
issuance we're planning,

656
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,003
the hole's all filled in.

657
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,631
We're going to announce
our upgrade plan tomorrow.

658
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,175
I'm looking forward
to the headlines.

659
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,262
I can take plenty
more than my train tech

660
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,806
to the Twin Cities.

661
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,100
I could take my business,
my holdings,

662
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,851
my taxes.

663
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,231
Your job isn't
to fix the trains.

664
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,401
It's to keep the whales like
me swimming in your waters,

665
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,194
raising the tides for everyone.

666
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,406
Oh, I've seen Blackfish.

667
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,283
But now I know from personal experience,
too.

668
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,078
Trying to work with you
only makes you hostile.

669
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,374
You're free to swim
where you please.

670
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,719
Two billion.

671
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,055
Sweeney's using my
own money to block me.

672
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,059
The Prague and Mexico
City bids have sent contingents

673
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,561
to Athens ahead
of tomorrow's vote.

674
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,188
They've set meetings.
That means one thing:

675
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,816
They've found the vulnerable
among the advance team,

676
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,235
and they're going to be very
persuasive in person. Very.

677
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,738
The Olympics aren't
going to be my curtain call.

678
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,616
I plan on having a lifetime of
grand projects, as you know.

679
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,745
My reputation and my
career are inseparable.

680
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,705
So we're back at square one.

681
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,914
With one day left.

682
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,126
Never feels like it,

683
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,169
but that's the best place to be.

684
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,796
We're bringing the ball up,

685
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,381
they're in a full-court defense.

686
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,924
Lotta pressure.

687
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:23,219
But you keep control
and break the press.

688
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,764
Nobody's back,
and it's an easy bucket.

689
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,434
We just gotta break the press.

690
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,903
You're a man with an
eerily extensive knowledge

691
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,071
of New York's darker corners.

692
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,157
Do you know where "Palazzo" is?

693
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,284
Not sure.

694
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,244
I did go to a pretty
incredible place once

695
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,246
in Okinawa called
"Whisper Alley"

696
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,957
when I was detailed to a
Department of Defense trip

697
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,959
with some generals, though.

698
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,961
There was a hell
of a banana show,

699
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,297
and they served sake

700
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,341
with a habu viper in the bottle.

701
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,136
You know what?

702
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,305
Never mind.

703
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,401
Chef Boulud says he will
handle any dietary restrictions.

704
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,488
The only restriction will
be my belt after I eat all this.

705
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,658
Though I have heard
the bouillabaisse is--

706
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,117
Oh, yeah, no, it sure is.

707
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,327
I had it a few years back.

708
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,871
We did. Together. At, uh, Café--

709
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,665
Boulud. Right.

710
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,166
Yes. With that...

711
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,377
weird couple we
met at The Blantyre.

712
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,878
Oh, my God.

713
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,547
Yes.

714
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,341
Oh, man,
the folks you meet on vacation.

715
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,510
Should stay in your memory,

716
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,178
before they take
down five martinis,

717
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,346
and never at your table.

718
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,183
Pick whatever looks good to you,
Chuck.

719
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,518
I'm sure it'll be great.

720
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,811
Okay, good.

721
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,861
I have been looking through
all of our Olympic dealings

722
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,197
with my Chuck goggles on,
and I found something.

723
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,032
The night you two
entertained the advance team

724
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,534
for the Commission.

725
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,202
The manifests for the
helicopter company Jersey

726
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,704
used that night have
been subpoenaed.

727
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,040
Nothing can be linked to M-TAP.

728
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,542
Doesn't have to be.

729
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,878
Chuck gets one lead,
announces an investigation,

730
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,630
Commission gets rattled
and goes with another city.

731
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,048
Do you all have
everything locked down?

732
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,884
That would be a question for...

733
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,719
Moi.

734
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,637
None of the professionals
involved in that evening's

735
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,348
activities are a liability.
Discretion is their craft.

736
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,268
Good. Make sure of it.

737
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,270
Best for us all if I
don't touch that one.

738
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,571
This Palazzo business.

739
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,406
Asking around with
the criminals in custody,

740
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,199
none of them can afford it.

741
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,452
All I've got is an old address.

742
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,912
It was becoming too well known,

743
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,204
so they picked up and
moved it elsewhere.

744
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,956
Well,
these places shuffle locations

745
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,083
like handsy priests
change dioceses.

746
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,418
We could use some help on this.

747
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,213
There's someone I can ask.

748
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,256
Thanks.

749
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,350
We're sorry,

750
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,893
you have reached a number

751
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,353
that has been disconnected

752
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,940
or is no longer in service.

753
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,691
The number
you dialed has been changed,

754
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,444
disconnected,
or is no longer in service.

755
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,868
Madison, it's me.

756
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,411
I can't get through
to the Palazzo.

757
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,913
Have you heard anything?

758
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,665
Has there been any trouble?

759
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,583
Ask around, would ya?

760
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,586
Okay. Let me know.

761
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,329
I'm here on business.

762
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,507
Thank you for agreeing
to see me again.

763
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,344
I know that you had
hoped to never have to.

764
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,389
That was a long time ago.

765
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,184
And you were a
good customer before.

766
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,104
My favorite kind.

767
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,814
Not for the right reasons.

768
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,108
Oh, I needed it, yeah.

769
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,029
At the moment, though--

770
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,363
I see that.

771
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,324
You're different now, changed.

772
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,828
For the time being, at least.

773
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,166
Palazzo. I need
its current location.

774
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,792
I didn't know any
other way to find it.

775
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,504
That place doesn't
offer what you're into.

776
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,674
Unless your arousal template
has completely changed--

777
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,593
I just need the address.

778
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,235
Like I said--

779
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,655
Strictly business.

780
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,615
I see.

781
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:40,078
Oh, and one more thing
you will absolutely need.

782
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,747
The password.

783
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,252
There's panic at the MTA.

784
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,713
Rankin Ratings Agency has just
put New York's subway system

785
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,715
- on Credit Watch Negative...
- Scooter!

786
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,884
...that's a warning to
investors that their rating

787
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,803
will be dropping soon.

788
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,429
There's already been a
discussion of shutting down

789
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,556
a subway line to cut costs...

790
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,434
I'm telling you this now
before you see it yourself.

791
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,686
Mase Carb is buying MTA bonds.

792
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,522
People are spooked by
the Credit Watch Negative

793
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,190
and they're selling them
like they're Beanie Babies.

794
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,608
But that's not all.

795
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,485
You'll see,
when you look at our sheet,

796
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,195
that we went to cash for this
ahead of the announcement.

797
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,988
So you were prepared?

798
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,616
You knew this was coming,
and you said nothing to me.

799
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,077
I encouraged Rankin to
take a closer look at the MTA.

800
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,122
And when they did,
they agreed with me that AAA was too high.

801
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,623
Mase Carb will make a profit,

802
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,375
and the MTA is
now in a tight spot,

803
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,044
which I believe is exactly
where you need them to be.

804
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,796
We saw it as a win-win.

805
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,299
Your pronouns haven't changed,
have they?

806
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,592
You're using "we" to mean...

807
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,136
Yes, I knew.

808
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,804
So you both did
this behind my back?

809
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,722
- For you, you mean.
- I made the choice

810
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,642
to ignite the fuse on a move
that would solve your problem.

811
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,603
The mayor is on the phone.
She wants to meet ASAP.

812
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,063
Ask her to hold a minute.

813
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,607
The governor will be calling also,
probably.

814
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,651
This could easily be
seen as manipulation.

815
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,778
If word leaks about this,
it could tank our bid--

816
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,280
everything we've
been working for.

817
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,240
What's the rating gonna be,
triple-B?

818
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,325
- Double-B.
- Jesus.

819
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:05,204
My best move is to get ahead
of this by calling foul now.

820
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,581
You were right. I
have the governor

821
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,082
on the line now, too.

822
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,418
Leonard Supple. MTA Board,
is also on the phone.

823
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,170
They all want the same meeting.

824
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,671
If you really want,
I can unwind all of this

825
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,464
before the new
rating is announced.

826
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,050
I can change it back and take
my ratings algo off the market.

827
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,469
No. Tell them all I'm
ready to meet tonight.

828
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,119
Lady Bertilak.

829
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,121
Members only tonight.

830
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,461
- Hup!

831
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,380
Let's move, people!

832
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,715
Man up! Lets go!

833
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,217
Go, go, go.

834
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,554
Ready?

835
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,973
- Hands on the wall!
- Police!

836
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,058
Hands on the wall!

837
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,606
Warrant?

838
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,581
I've never seen a bridge club
with so many patrons under 25.

839
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,668
I'd like to see 'em
try and play a hand.

840
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,002
It's clear.

841
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,420
We got nothing.

842
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,304
It's all good.

843
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,941
They're gone.

844
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,317
They didn't find anything.

845
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,152
Damn right!

846
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,196
Next time I pay every employee

847
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,781
their full night's wages,

848
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,658
something unspeakable
is going to transpire,

849
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,119
and I will be right
in the middle of it.

850
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,837
We both should've
seen this coming.

851
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,840
We've shown the stealth
of a Santa Con bar crawl.

852
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,926
They were expecting us.

853
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,762
Now once, in college,
I participated

854
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,806
in what was called a "Hash run."

855
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,892
The idea is only the
organizer of the run

856
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,353
knows the true route.

857
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,896
He or she marks it out

858
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,065
with small piles of
flour on the ground,

859
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,276
but only intermittently.

860
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,945
You have to uncover
the route as you go,

861
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,989
wrong turns and all.

862
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,991
Sounds like an effective
model for tricking yourself

863
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,076
into running longer. But
not for an investigation.

864
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,578
I disagree.

865
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,997
There,
the reward was supposedly in the doing.

866
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,832
There was nothing
waiting at the end other than

867
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,001
a fleeting sense of
accomplishment and shin splints.

868
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:00,338
We may have gone down
an unfruitful path tonight,

869
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,048
but there is more to uncover.

870
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,924
But that's exactly it, Chuck.

871
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,426
We have no idea if that's true.

872
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,762
That presto
change-o tells us it is.

873
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,056
If Prince wants to
win the Olympics,

874
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,099
he'll have to offer plenty
more than one night

875
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,976
at a sex club.

876
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,562
The final vote is in
less than 24 hours.

877
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,689
When men like Prince
are under pressure,

878
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,940
they take shortcuts.

879
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,400
Yeah, so you've said.

880
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,652
But all we've got to
show for that theory

881
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,571
is an armed raid
on a bridge club.

882
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,448
You know that
was no bridge club.

883
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,368
Sure, but that's not how
it's gonna look on the books.

884
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,046
Double-B.

885
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,381
Tough break.

886
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,926
Fuckin' Rankin.

887
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,136
We canceled the debt offering.

888
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,889
Set off a chain reaction
across every maturity.

889
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,641
I assume you have
a cash shortfall now,

890
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,059
hence the meeting?

891
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,727
Yeah, we'll, uh,
we'll do your plan.

892
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,729
The Olympic Express,
the signal overhaul, all of it.

893
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,398
And you're okay
accepting private funds?

894
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,066
We have to. It's the
only way we can keep

895
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,901
the lines running at this point.

896
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,696
Oh, I'm a moon jelly.

897
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,198
I drift with the tides,

898
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,033
and they've turned.

899
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,910
I'm back on Team Olympics.

900
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,829
No. I'm just happy I can help.

901
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,206
Sruthi?

902
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,166
Let's get started right now.

903
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,126
Mark?

904
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,754
We don't have a second to lose.

905
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,139
Damn.

906
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,435
Colin Drache.

907
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,936
The unknown on the
chopper that night?

908
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,438
- I looked into him.
- Hmm.

909
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,564
If we're trying
to catch a fixer,

910
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,648
my money's on this bub.

911
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,941
He's not a Commission member?

912
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,651
He used to be Commish,

913
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,612
but he left under a cloud
of suspicion after Sochi.

914
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,073
Word is he ended up with a villa

915
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,075
on the Black
Sea for his efforts.

916
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,120
He's "consulted" on
all the games since.

917
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,830
Have any charges been brought?

918
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,749
- Anything been proven?
- Guy's a Vaselined watermelon.

919
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,752
Where there's smoke,
there's always burning piles of money.

920
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,463
We're taking this to Sweeney.

921
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,590
I'm going to pass on
another uninvited bust-in.

922
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,966
That hasn't worked
out for me this week.

923
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,968
Fine. Call your private eye.

924
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,470
See what he can
find on Colin Drache.

925
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,394
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drop that fork

926
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,812
before you take a
mouthful of bung!

927
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,231
What the hell, Chuck?

928
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,232
This is salad niçoise.

929
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,817
Uh-huh, so they say,

930
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,486
but you never know.

931
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,154
If prepared the right way,

932
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,531
pig rectum can
pass for calamari.

933
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,658
- Often does.
- Yep.

934
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,702
Bung on your tongue.

935
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,832
And now you've
ruined my appetite.

936
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,794
Mike Prince has prepared
a golden brown Olympic bid,

937
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,172
and he's served it
to you with a smile

938
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,174
and a little ramekin
of marinara.

939
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,635
But,
as with all things that man does,

940
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,012
it's not as genuine
as it appears.

941
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,680
This shit again?

942
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,015
Look, Chuck,
I tried playing for your side.

943
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,475
I really did.

944
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,809
The man came back
with a baseball bat

945
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,228
and took it to my budget

946
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,896
like Sonny LoSpecchio
in Bronx Tale.

947
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,690
And as with the offense
that inspired that work,

948
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,318
the truth of Prince's
misdeeds will come out.

949
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,612
He's using a fixer to
move the Commission.

950
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,489
Get ahead on this.

951
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,033
Stop backing the
Olympics and save yourself

952
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,451
from going down with him.

953
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,453
You got a case?

954
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,956
Because every bid has a consultant,
Chuck.

955
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,333
And most of these guys
aren't winning any civic awards.

956
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,668
So surely you
can prove all this.

957
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,169
Oh, I'm building one.

958
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,212
Hell of a case.

959
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,214
I want the Olympics now, Chuck.

960
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,840
In fact, I need them.

961
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,718
The games are gonna
do good things for the city,

962
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,303
like fix the subways.

963
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,514
And for me,
it's gonna launch me onto

964
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,057
the national political stage.

965
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,559
But think of the downside,

966
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,686
the adverse
consequences for the city.

967
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,063
So it'll enrich Mike Prince
and his "steering committee"

968
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,065
of other billies a bit more.

969
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,734
But none of this would've
happened without their cash.

970
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,153
So the pros outweigh the cons.

971
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,912
Colin's here.

972
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,207
This'll be a quick meeting.

973
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,750
Let's go clinch these games.

974
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,255
Well,
congratulations are in order.

975
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,257
You've put in one hell of a bid.

976
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,175
The Commission is impressed.

977
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,094
Well, we couldn't have done
it without your guidance, Colin.

978
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,931
The stadium, the venues,
the scholarships.

979
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,434
The Olympic Express
was a great idea.

980
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,935
They really like the
sound of that one.

981
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,770
As did the MTA.

982
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,023
You've now given them every
reason to choose New York...

983
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,861
except for one.

984
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,946
As I say, all are impressed,

985
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,241
but there are certain parties...

986
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,951
that, um,

987
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,203
may still need to be...

988
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,543
inspired.

989
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,843
Would you gentlemen excuse us?

990
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,563
I know what a two-person
meeting means.

991
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,648
And I know what
happens to someone

992
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,232
when they go down this road.

993
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,734
You're gonna wake up
tomorrow a different person

994
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,819
in ways you don't
see for a long time.

995
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,072
Even if it gets you the games,

996
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,740
don't do it.

997
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,159
You know why Scooter went
straight back to his office?

998
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,328
Because he knows what I know.

999
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,872
I'll be fine.

1000
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,691
Do you think Rankin will
use our ratings program

1001
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,401
to actually issue
better ratings?

1002
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,861
Or will they sit on it now
that it's no longer a threat

1003
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,530
and go back to
business as usual?

1004
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,156
Honestly, I don't know.

1005
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,159
Are you here to clear
your conscience?

1006
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,161
Tell me I did the wrong
thing by selling to them?

1007
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,372
Honestly, no.

1008
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,790
I'm sure you had a reason.

1009
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,833
I did.

1010
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,177
Thank you for this.

1011
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,054
Call me with anything
else you turn up. Yeah.

1012
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,355
We've got to scoop up
Colin Drache and sweat him.

1013
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,399
I just got the Intel
back from my guy.

1014
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,526
We may finally have something.

1015
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,487
There's a web of wire
transfers attached to Drache.

1016
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,406
Can they be traced
back to Prince?

1017
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,158
Or to any rogue ICS members?

1018
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,743
We can't tell where
the wires came from,

1019
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,411
or their final destination.

1020
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,872
But Drache recently
received five million dollars

1021
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,498
to an offshore account.

1022
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,375
If that money came
from Mike Prince...

1023
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,002
Can we be sure?

1024
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,920
It's just as likely
those wires came from

1025
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,589
the Mexico City or Prague bids.

1026
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,008
Colin's had contact with
all of them at different points.

1027
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,760
Your P.I. can't
untangle the knot?

1028
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,220
Not without the voluntary
cooperation of the banks.

1029
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,056
Well,
then there's only one way to know for sure.

1030
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,142
If the confetti falls
on New York tonight,

1031
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,311
we'll know that Prince's payment
to Colin Drache got it done.

1032
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,062
And we grab Drache right there.

1033
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,440
Snatch him up before the
announcement is made.

1034
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,157
We sure Prague isn't
gonna take this from us?

1035
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,619
The Vegas books had it at
a 20.7% implied probability.

1036
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,204
London at 20 even.

1037
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,581
So am I gonna have
a bunch of angry

1038
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,958
construction workers busting
my onions tomorrow morning?

1039
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,126
Nah.

1040
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,045
I woke up joyful today.

1041
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,297
My body tells me we'll win this.

1042
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,966
Thank you to the
candidate cities

1043
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:46,094
for your incredible
bid presentations.

1044
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,763
All were worthy.

1045
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,307
But one bid stood
above all the others.

1046
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,310
And the International
Commission of Sport

1047
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,312
has the honor of announcing

1048
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,273
that the Olympic Games in 2028

1049
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,775
are awarded to...

1050
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,405
New York City!

1051
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:08,116
- Yes!

1052
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,210
You actually did the thing.

1053
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,628
We did.

1054
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,270
Hey, everybody,
let's get out and celebrate with the city!

1055
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,604
This is exciting.

1056
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,273
I feel like I won the gold.

1057
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,483
I'm filled with
patriotic fervor.

1058
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,610
It feels heady,
just like a whip-it.

1059
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,572
Hey, good job.

1060
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,202
- Well done, Mike.
- Thanks for your help.

1061
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,956
You did a lot to make
this happen today.

1062
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,374
Thank you for the recognition.

1063
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,959
But I thought you
didn't like my move.

1064
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,712
I didn't mind what you
did. I mind how you did it.

1065
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,380
I'm not the drunk
dad in the family.

1066
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,007
You don't need to
make secret plans

1067
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,174
about how to manage
me at Christmas,

1068
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,676
where to hide the booze.

1069
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,469
I can know these things.

1070
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,693
2028!

1071
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,790
There he is.

1072
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,503
New York, we did it!

1073
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,423
2028's gonna be an
incredible time in this city!

1074
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,473
Excuse me.

1075
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,069
Drache is gone.

1076
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:14,284
Vaselined watermelon
motherfucker!

1077
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,203
Oh, of course he's gone, Dave.

1078
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,205
He never existed.

1079
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,581
But look who's still up there.

1080
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,375
Mike Prince and friends.

1081
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,211
Prince didn't pull this
off all by his lonesome.

1082
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,296
He and his cabal of rich cronies

1083
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,507
steamrolled the
city and the state

1084
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,509
and elements of the
goddamned Commission of Sport

1085
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,052
to get this done.

1086
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,054
So we separate Prince
from his power base.

1087
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,140
Mmm-hmm. Let him fall like
the smoke from the fireworks

1088
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,142
drifting down on this fine city.

1089
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,787
Well, another win for the good guys,
right?

1090
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,248
I think it's a
win for all of us.

1091
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,333
The city. The country.
The whole thing.

1092
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,296
Smile, Chuck.

1093
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,881
You're on the
winning team this time.

1094
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,552
Nah. I'm staying on my side.

1095
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,098
And losers for now
will be later to win.

1096
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,224
Right?

1097
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,352
No surprise there.

1098
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,188
Come gather 'round people

1099
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,191
Wherever you roam

1100
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,862
And admit that the waters

1101
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:35,032
Above you have grown

1102
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:38,035
And accept it that soon

1103
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,871
You'll be drenched
To the bone...

1104
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,376
We're
gonna drink this down.

1105
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,670
Oh, that sounds good,
but I can't stay.

1106
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,506
Why?

1107
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,716
You can come with,
but I have to go back

1108
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,051
to the St. Regis to pack.

1109
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,677
Pack?

1110
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,013
- We just won.
- Hell, yeah, we won!

1111
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,932
But before the games,
I need spend time in the mountains,

1112
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,559
climbing with prospective
team members.

1113
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,894
You're competing here.

1114
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,520
Don't you need to
practice on location?

1115
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,565
The best training atmosphere for me now,
is out west.

1116
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,067
You know that.

1117
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,653
Yeah, but I thought we were gonna try,
here, us?

1118
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,238
Like we talked about.

1119
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,407
Yeah,
we also talked about you being willing

1120
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,576
to fly to Prague, remember?

1121
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,411
Much shorter flights to Denver.

1122
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,457
So the work falls on me again.

1123
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,339
Is that how you feel?

1124
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,967
No. It's not.

1125
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:40,222
I just need to know that you're in it,
too.

1126
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,643
My level of commitment,

1127
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,311
to everything I do,

1128
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,605
has not been in doubt
since summer camp

1129
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,315
when I was 8.

1130
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,775
The rock wall.

1131
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,735
Yeah. Four-sided.

1132
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,655
They made us put
on lipstick to climb it.

1133
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,240
There were photos
of heartthrobs,

1134
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,866
like Johnny Depp
and Michael J. Fox.

1135
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,452
And we had to put a
big lipstick kiss on one

1136
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,412
when we made it to the top.

1137
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,414
I had a different
version of that action

1138
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,250
in the locker room
at basketball camp.

1139
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,711
The Olympics mean

1140
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,339
something very different
to me than they do to you.

1141
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,051
There's a gold
medal waiting now,

1142
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,138
not some lipstick-smeared
photo of River Phoenix.

1143
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,889
This is everything

1144
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,599
I ever worked for.

1145
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,602
And I need you
to put in the time

1146
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,146
to do the work,

1147
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,314
and climb for the kiss.

1148
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,326
Yes.

1149
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,703
Yes, you're right.

1150
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,664
And I will.

1151
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,213
Well, then,
you can open that bottle of champagne.

1152
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,548
I can pack in the morning.

1153
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,230
I reached Wendy.

1154
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,898
She sends her apologies.

1155
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,566
She doesn't think
Chuck's gonna show either.

1156
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,902
Oh, really?

1157
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,779
Well, dinner is ready.

1158
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,407
Would you, uh, get the children

1159
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,243
and maybe come and join me?

1160
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,161
- Yeah, I'll-I'll check.
- Okay, thank you.

1161
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,248
The line it is drawn

1162
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,460
The curse

1163
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,545
It is cast

1164
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,717
And the slow one now

1165
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,097
Will later be...

1166
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,515
They're not hungry.

1167
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,269
Well, take a seat.

1168
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,771
Have dinner with me.

1169
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,524
This is a Long
Island Fluke Crudo,

1170
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,694
with gooseberry and sea beans.

1171
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,241
So good. Holy sh--, Chef,

1172
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,243
that's... wow.

1173
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,371
Thank you. Bon appétit.

1174
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,249
Will later

1175
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,960
Be last

1176
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,255
For the times

1177
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,468
They are a-changin'

1178
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:11,975
A...

1179
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,144
A-changin'

1179
00:55:15,305 --> 00:56:15,421
