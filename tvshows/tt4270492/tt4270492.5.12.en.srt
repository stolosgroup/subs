1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,419
Previously
on Billions.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,546
It needs to be legalized,
and federally.

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,047
Yeah, right on, hop-head.

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,382
My two enemies have linked up.

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,843
Whatever he's goin' after,
I'm gonna take it.

6
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,554
This is about control
over me one last time.

7
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,098
D'you want to be done?
Then let's be done.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,516
I sold to Axe.

9
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,602
I have to share some shit that's
making me feel seriously awk.

10
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,105
Taylor went behind Axe's
back to lay off the cannabis deal

11
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,064
to a third party.

12
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,399
Whoa, fuck. Who?

13
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,692
Lawrence Boyd.

14
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,485
You can't really
say you're playing

15
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,529
unless you're willing
to put your highest value

16
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,905
pieces on the board.

17
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,741
My country house.
It is now your house.

18
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,118
Just cross out Prince's
name in the deal

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,411
and put mine in.

20
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,872
And I will use his due
diligence as my own.

21
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:39,873
Fuck yeah!

22
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,042
He actually closed
on that money.

23
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,334
Time to arrest Winslow.

24
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,920
You found the one CEO who
also happened to be running

25
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,464
a criminal enterprise.

26
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,591
Just another drug dealer
moving major weight.

27
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,176
Douse the fucking smokes. Now!

28
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,886
Sometime in the next 24 hours,

29
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,596
they believe they'll
have you in custody.

30
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,432
And they don't believe you
have a way out this time.

31
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,600
What do you want us to do?

32
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,186
I have no fucking idea.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,074
Support us and become VIP member 
to remove all ads from www.OpenSubtitles.org

34
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,303
He here? Up in his office?

35
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,263
Where else he gonna be?

36
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,808
It is his office, right?

37
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,103
For now.

38
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,115
So I finally got a clean test.

39
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,616
Just in time for this.

40
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,243
Worst-case it for me.

41
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,702
No point in that.

42
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,162
We need to mount a vigorous--

43
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,705
Worst-case it.

44
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,707
You want to talk
worst-case scenarios?

45
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,461
Okay. But it'll
be a mood killer.

46
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,672
It's hard to kill what's already dead,
Orrin.

47
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,090
Fair.

48
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,758
Okay. Worst case is

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,553
the NYAG has you
on a pu-pu platter

50
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,763
of violations related
to Winslow's arrest.

51
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,473
As the head of a bank,

52
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,684
it is your fiduciary
responsibility

53
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,477
to know your
customer's business--

54
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,687
the fact that she was selling

55
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,021
and processing,
through Axe Bank,

56
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,565
the proceeds of
illegal marijuana.

57
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,359
So... I'm the farmer
in the fucking dell.

58
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,819
Right in the
center of the circle.

59
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,613
Worse,
Rhoades can work with the Manhattan DA

60
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,992
and potentially his old cronies
at the US Attorney's Office

61
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,703
to use that as a gateway to local,
state, and federal

62
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,371
money-laundering violations

63
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,540
and false records
and statements.

64
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,585
They will see you are
more than negligent,

65
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:52,547
that you willfully ignored
and actually conspired

66
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,923
with the money-laundering.

67
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:58,386
This will have real
teeth criminally.

68
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,388
Fangs, because they go deep

69
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,223
and suck the life out of you.

70
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,266
Fuck!

71
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,518
How many years am I facing?

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,979
We'll pick off the shakier
aspects of the case.

73
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,608
We'll claim there were efforts
made to conceal by Winslow.

74
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,152
We'll work the jury pool
for maximum weakness

75
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,570
and/or affinity.

76
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,322
Worst. Case.

77
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,656
Don't make me say it again.

78
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,491
Now. How many years?

79
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,369
Fifteen, 20, likely,

80
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,121
for you as the chairman.

81
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,414
For the CEO...

82
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,708
But I hardly had a
chance to do anything.

83
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,710
I'm a figurehead.
You know it. I know it.

84
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,753
They definitely know it.

85
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,338
They don't give a shit, Wags.

86
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,547
No, they don't.

87
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,258
Your name's on the contract as CEO,
Wags.

88
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,843
You signed. It was notarized.

89
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,803
So you take the weight
right along with Bobby.

90
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,264
Isn't this, I don't know,
entrapment?

91
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,100
Only if Chuck induced
Winslow to grow the illicit crop.

92
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,102
He likely found out
about this after the fact

93
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,062
and used it.

94
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,482
But whatever he did wrong,
whatever was out of line,

95
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,108
-I will dig into.
-Damn right.

96
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,238
Because believe me,
you will find there's plenty out of line.

97
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,948
This way this guy rolls.

98
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,908
And we need to show the world.

99
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,160
The freezing of your assets,
along with Axe Bank's

100
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,329
and Axe Asset
Management's funds,

101
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,499
will coincide with the issuance
of an arrest warrant on you.

102
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,000
Jesus Christ.

103
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:15,171
They're gonna arrest and freeze me too,
aren't they?

104
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,506
Motherfucker.

105
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,801
This has been defined as a
worst-case scenario meeting, so,

106
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,387
yes, of course they are, Wags.

107
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,305
Fast or slow...

108
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,432
how do you want to play it?

109
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,109
Let 'em bring
it. Let's get it on.

110
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,194
I'll make it happen as quickly
as possible, then.

111
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,238
I can arrange a surrender,
but you'll have to honor it.

112
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,490
You can't do a
runaround like last time.

113
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,908
Oh, I'll honor it.

114
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,787
More than that,
I'm gonna fight it loudly and publicly.

115
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,959
And once and for all,
because he's in my way now,

116
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,296
on things that are even
more important than business.

117
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,218
So push the timeline on this,
Orrin. Fast.

118
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,179
The arrest, the battle,
the victory.

119
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,140
I will.

120
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,435
I can't handle your defense myself,
Wags.

121
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,395
But I'll put you with a killer.

122
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,023
Talk later in the ante meridiem,
Bobby.

123
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,610
Don't you have a
meeting to attend to?

124
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,989
Seems that should
now become the priority.

125
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,366
Yeah.

126
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,165
Before I go,
I need you to understand something.

127
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,334
I can't.

128
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,627
There's no scenario
where I survive a year in jail,

129
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,880
much less what
we're looking at here.

130
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,882
You're not going to jail.

131
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:47,847
Well, you might. It's probable,
actually.

132
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,433
But you are a lot stronger
than you think you are.

133
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,018
I know exactly how strong I am,

134
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,604
and it's one notch less
than strong enough for jail.

135
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,980
We'll get with consultants.

136
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,232
I'll have it all
organized for ourselves.

137
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,233
It will suck,

138
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,528
but this is something
you will live through.

139
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,781
Axe,

140
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,699
I worship at your altar, sir.

141
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,578
But I'm telling you right now,
I'm never

142
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,956
walking into a jail cell
with my name on it.

143
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:18,753
Whatever I have to do,
I'll do it.

144
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,421
I believe you.

145
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,842
Thanks for telling me.

146
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,929
But we are a long way
from walking into a cell.

147
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,713
Not really the kickoff
I envisioned for us.

148
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,093
I wanted a conscious...

149
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,096
a beginning.

150
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,767
I pictured thatched
huts over blue water.

151
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,936
Not courtrooms. Board shorts.

152
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,479
Not suits and ties.

153
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,190
Yeah, well,
that's the thing about something real.

154
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,234
It doesn't have to
look like a fantasy.

155
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,362
You're still in?

156
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,573
Where am I standing?

157
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,575
Where I always have.

158
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,118
Back-to-back with you,

159
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,662
wading into the
fight together...

160
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,459
...which means getting
back to the office before

161
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,252
all this really breaks.

162
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,463
Deal with the
troops while you...

163
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,547
Yeah.

164
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,092
Start breaking
things... as discussed.

165
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,518
Warrants are imminent.

166
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,897
And I have to say, the idea of
him being surprised like this...

167
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh,
there's something glorious in it.

168
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,109
His plane?

169
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,527
Uh, being watched.

170
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,945
Poised to seize both of them.

171
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,113
Tail numbers have no-fly orders.

172
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,949
-Smart.
-Oh, no circus this time.

173
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,993
The assets are ready to
go into the deep freeze.

174
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,495
So now it's down
to the perp walk.

175
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,829
What do you have planned?

176
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,789
The lefty guns scoop up
while he's about to do a job,

177
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,666
or the shake-and-wake
while he's in bed?

178
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,834
I considered all of it.

179
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,878
But I want it to
be at the office.

180
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,133
I walk him out rear-cuffed
in front of his loyal troops.

181
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,177
Let them see him broken.

182
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,513
Let that break them.

183
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,016
You seem tired. Late night?

184
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,186
Nah. Just couldn't sleep on
account of all the excitement.

185
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,979
What about Winslow?
What are you gonna--

186
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,439
Oh, that's wired.

187
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,775
She's in custody but has been
provided access to a cell phone

188
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,110
in case he calls,
so as not to raise suspicion.

189
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,779
Nice. Seems like
you covered all the--

190
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,240
We're aware you plan
on arresting my client

191
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,534
Robert Axelrod shortly.

192
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,579
It is the policy of this office

193
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,999
not to comment on ongoing investigations,
if there is one.

194
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,087
Mr. Attorney General,
Chuck, come on.

195
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,756
Let's spare everyone
the raree-show

196
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,883
and set a surrender date.

197
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,885
I'm thinking 24 hours from now,

198
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,721
with the place to be
mutually agreed upon.

199
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:22,311
If I agree,
if you say Axelrod will surrender,

200
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,605
it's your word,
your law license,

201
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,858
and your ass on the line,
Mr. Bach.

202
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,694
Assurances have been made,

203
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,698
so I can make
them to you. But hey,

204
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,992
see for yourself.

205
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,286
...what amounts to a
campaign against me,

206
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,873
resulting in what I understand
is to be yet another arrest.

207
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,917
So I say to the
Attorney General,

208
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,168
come on, Chuck.

209
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,129
Come on down here
and arrest me now.

210
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,171
I can prove my innocence.

211
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,466
Fuck me. He's downstairs.

212
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,594
Right across the street.

213
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,346
...and so you know, as I do,

214
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,559
that whatever kind of
supposed crime I committed

215
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,062
is really just the crime
of living and breathing

216
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,064
in Chuck Rhoades's
general vicinity.

217
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,357
This is fucked.

218
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,984
Yeah. But our man's
fucking 'em right back,

219
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,153
and in their backyard, no less.

220
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,280
This seems like going up
to a murder hornet's nest,

221
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,241
shaking it and almost
asking it to sting you.

222
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,410
If Bobby Axelrod
shook a hornet's nest,

223
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,953
the goddamn hornet ought to have

224
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,413
the goddamn
sense to stay inside.

225
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,416
I don't know, Dollar Bill.
A hornet's kind of like me.

226
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,878
Once we're in attack mode,
we don't fucking retreat.

227
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,046
You're freaking me out.

228
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,881
But look,
now is the time to stand

229
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,050
to get this thing
done once and for all.

230
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,343
So come on, Chuck.

231
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:39,972
Charge me with something
and see if you can make it stick.

232
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,182
Oh.

233
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,601
So, then,
you heard me. Where are the cuffs?

234
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,436
Oh... you don't get to
decide the when and where

235
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,146
-on my timetable.

236
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,524
It appears that your timetable
is as many years as you like.

237
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,861
But it seems like just yesterday
you were striding in my office

238
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,696
to tell me that you
had nothing to lose.

239
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,239
Or was it the day
before yesterday,

240
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,575
and yesterday was
when you were telling me

241
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,120
that it was worth it for
you to go down with me.

242
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,082
This is personal.
It's not judicial.

243
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,793
And this is when I finally
get my chance to prove it.

244
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,127
Oh, yes.

245
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,048
He will get the day in
court he so richly deserves.

246
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,593
Once I have everything in order,
and I will, quite soon,

247
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,469
it'll happen.

248
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,055
Mr. Axelrod will
surrender to me.

249
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,516
That's a legal term,
to be clear, Chuck.

250
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,770
So I will. Technically.

251
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,979
But know this...

252
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,900
I will be fighting you
to my dying breath.

253
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,193
Another
word before you go?

254
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,361
Mr. Rhodes
before you leave.

255
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,378
So then, any more questions?

256
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,631
I will answer whatever
my mouthpiece will allow.

257
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,344
Well, I want to cheer too,

258
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,221
but these circumstances
feel trepidatious.

259
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,474
Yeah, I'm feeling discomfited
about my future.

260
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,101
Oh, look,
the fucking vocab twins.

261
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,352
You guys aren't getting it.

262
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,230
You don't drag an
alley fighter into an alley.

263
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,691
'Cause that's what Axe is,
an alley fighter,

264
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,067
a real Carboni.

265
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,194
And that's where Chuck
Rhoades just dragged him.

266
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,947
While they're alley fighting,
where does that leave us?

267
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,407
It leaves you head down,
eyes forward,

268
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,826
doing good work earning
returns for the firm--

269
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,661
or the bank, as the case may be.

270
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,954
The rest will sort itself out.

271
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,290
Much like the recent
unpleasantness.

272
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,042
We need to stay
calm and unified.

273
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,461
That'll be a first
for this place.

274
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,380
Yeah. And won't the
assets be frozen and seized?

275
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,133
He'll come up with a workaround.
Like he has in the past.

276
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,593
Like he always does.

277
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,096
Yes, I'm-- I'm sure some kind
of arrangement will be struck.

278
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,223
Near-term,
the negative press will suck.

279
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,850
But in the long run,

280
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,645
we will win, as we always have.

281
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,397
So was his getting
out ahead of it

282
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,358
with a press conference
part of the plan?

283
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,402
These things are fluid.

284
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,991
I can't spare the
time or the focus

285
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,618
to take the two
of you apart today.

286
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,996
But if I did, believe me,
you'd be lying on the floor in pieces.

287
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,372
Taylor,
I can understand why you think

288
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,124
anything you do
to him is justified.

289
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,628
You've basically become him,
on his worst day.

290
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,087
But Rian,

291
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,965
you still have the spark
of a soul about you.

292
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,218
The way you used me for--

293
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,012
Not even your own ends,
but Taylor's?

294
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,182
If you don't about-face now,
this minute,

295
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,309
you won't even
recognize who you were

296
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,102
by the time you turn 26.

297
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,366
I thought you had
your arms around this.

298
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,700
I did. I do.

299
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,619
Believe me,
I'm taking fucking measures.

300
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,330
I hope so. Because a wounded
and cornered Bobby Axelrod

301
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,499
is not something many survive.

302
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,962
I'm not for firing squads.

303
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,213
-Good to know.
-Yeah.

304
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,464
I saw the Kubrick
film as a tyke,

305
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,424
turned me off
'em. But if I were,

306
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,428
it would be for those who
leak secrets to enemy forces,

307
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,222
leave us unprotected against--

308
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,390
Yes. True.

309
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,308
I could tell you stories.

310
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,726
Yeah, I'm sure you could, Karl.

311
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,229
But right now,
the story we need to tell

312
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,649
is that of the arrest and
conviction of Robert Axelrod.

313
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,528
Later,
we will find and punish the leaker.

314
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,238
Not against the wall, though.

315
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,031
We'll stop just short of that.

316
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,157
Yes.

317
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,493
For now,
I want surveillance on Axelrod

318
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,578
to prevent any bullshit.

319
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,288
I want Michael
Wagner scooped up.

320
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,332
We'll sweat him.
Work on him to flip.

321
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,419
Probably useless,
but I want my time in the ring.

322
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,670
You'll have it.

323
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,089
We need to put Axe in a
spot where he takes a plea.

324
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,299
No trial.

325
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,302
No popularity contest
or chance to manipulate.

326
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,553
Hmm. We move to
sequester the jury,

327
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,179
so that he can't
try to buy them.

328
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,265
But, Chuck,
we do have a strong enough case to--

329
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,892
As we have in the past.

330
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,934
No.

331
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,519
We make him admit his guilt.

332
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,645
Take his punishment.

333
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,189
We win with a plea
even before a trial

334
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,275
because that win, that justice,

335
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,110
is the important thing.

336
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,778
As Patrick Ewing knows well,

337
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,947
don't settle for a finger roll,

338
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,616
dunk the fucking ball.

339
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,911
I don't even understand
what Wendy was saying,

340
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,787
but it made me feel icky.

341
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,914
No, she is right.

342
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,666
You won't recognize yourself
by the end of our time together.

343
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,793
Because that person
you were lied to herself

344
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,587
about who she was
and what she wanted.

345
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,214
That was a person who
became artsy and quirky

346
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,134
and analytical when she
was picked on as a kid

347
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,012
instead of using
what she really felt,

348
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,305
which was hatred.

349
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,141
I did not. I don't hate.

350
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,519
You do. You've turned
it into something else.

351
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,355
Like I used to.

352
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,899
But it was impressed
upon me that instead,

353
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,150
and listen to me here,

354
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,154
instead,
it's best turned into fuel

355
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,657
because it's effective.

356
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,576
And nothing burns as clean.

357
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,625
This is not a
usual investment meeting.

358
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,335
For this next little stretch,

359
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,963
I'll be relaying my
instructions to you remotely.

360
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,214
As will I.

361
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,466
We won't be in the
office as much as usual.

362
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,009
So it's goodbye for now

363
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,719
while we take cover to fight.

364
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,263
But we will be back at
it again soon enough.

365
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,932
We'll hold it down for you,
boss.

366
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,350
I know you will, Bill.

367
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,560
That's why there'll always be
a place for an operator like you

368
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,645
in the money business.

369
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,563
And your place is here, Axe Cap.

370
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,441
Now, keep your eyes open for
opportunity, even now.

371
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,318
You got it.

372
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,903
It feels like we're at the end.

373
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,991
Nah, the end of the beginning
is all, Ben Kim.

374
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,202
Come on.

375
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,960
All right?

376
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,298
Sean, how much is in
the Foundation right now?

377
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,509
The princely sum of 570 million.

378
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,469
We're gonna need a
war chest for this battle.

379
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,598
I need to have it transferred to
a new entity for the time being.

380
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,100
I'll send you the information.

381
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:02,104
I have always had a plan at
the ready for this contingency.

382
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,397
Able man you are.

383
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,607
We'll be back at those
good works soon enough.

384
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,987
As always,
I serve at your pleasure.

385
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,999
Catch up with you later.

386
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,422
I didn't think I needed to
hear what the rest of them did.

387
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,882
And I didn't think you'd show.

388
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,801
-I'm not scared.
-I know what you did.

389
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,429
That Boyd move with
the cannabis company

390
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,265
wasn't self-interest
or a greed play.

391
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,600
You fucking baited me.

392
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,893
You once said to me

393
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,229
you didn't think you
learned enough from me yet.

394
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,773
Seems like now you have.

395
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,859
I thought we'd
come together here.

396
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,112
You forced me back into working
for you practically at gunpoint.

397
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,198
So along the way,
you thought you'd team up with Chuck

398
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,407
to fuck me?

399
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,785
I decided it right from the start,
as you know.

400
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,620
I just forgot
for a little while.

401
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,662
Uh-huh.

402
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,123
Even though it was
me that took you in?

403
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,626
Just another fucking math nerd?

404
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,669
One with potential to be sure,

405
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,171
but one of many.

406
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,506
If you had more than one of me,

407
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,716
you'd have gotten rid of
the actual me long ago.

408
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,095
But you didn't because I
am a special fucking case,

409
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,596
as you might put it.

410
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,890
Not so special you didn't
need me to platform you.

411
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,267
I propped you up,
brought you along,

412
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,394
gave you the keys to
a fucking space shuttle.

413
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,272
I thought you wanted
to get rich together,

414
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,941
and I let that fool me.

415
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,819
But your problem,
as an investor,

416
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,738
is that your idealism is at
war with your profit drive.

417
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,532
And one day that will ruin you.

418
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:40,119
While your problem, as a boss,
as a mentor, as a person,

419
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,579
is you see my work product,
my company, me,

420
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,706
as yours to do
with as you see fit.

421
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,709
And so now you've
killed your mentor.

422
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,086
Congratulations.

423
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,630
Must mean... what?

424
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,341
Now you're strong?

425
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,843
You can lead?

426
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,844
Maybe.

427
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,804
I did think I'd feel better about it,
though,

428
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,265
have some sense of
victory or accomplishment.

429
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,309
You never did react
well to competition.

430
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,602
No.

431
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,521
But I have come to
realize I'll do anything

432
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,856
for my own autonomy.

433
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,692
So you figured you'd
let the government freeze

434
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,901
everything that's mine,

435
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,570
and then go to your
pal Chuck Rhoades

436
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,573
and break off your piece
and go off on your own?

437
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,951
Something along those lines.

438
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,955
But now, all I really feel is...

439
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,874
sadness.

440
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,669
That I want to thank you,
as ridiculous as that is.

441
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,005
And I think I'm...

442
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,924
no, I am sorry.

443
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,385
Sorry that it came to this.

444
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,386
You're sorry?

445
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,389
Shit. You'll get over it.

446
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,016
The amount of time you spend

447
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,768
feeling bad over slitting
your enemies' throats

448
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,062
will get shorter and
shorter in the future

449
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,024
until it's barely
a fucking blip.

450
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,360
And if you don't get over it,

451
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,904
well,
you can bring me some cookies

452
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,866
to Wallkill Correctional
on visiting day.

453
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:05,037
But I don't think it's
gonna go that way.

454
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,040
And I think you know that.

455
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,139
Well, Mr. Wagner,

456
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,975
we find ourselves across
the table once again.

457
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:31,230
Only this time,
you don't have your master to hide behind.

458
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,606
I have Neal, here, though.

459
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,733
'Fraid that's not
going to be much help.

460
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,278
Oh, you're facing up to 25 years,
friend-o.

461
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,863
Two bits.   Vente-cinco.

462
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,616
That's what a bank CEO like
you who's driven clear over

463
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,118
the lane markers of
Know Your Customer,

464
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,538
smack into the guardrails of
Anti-Money Laundering laws,

465
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,831
is staring down.

466
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,084
Long time. You'll be a
senior citizen looking for

467
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,378
your Social Security check
by the time you get out.

468
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,213
If Social Security
even exists by then.

469
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,841
But there is a golden
ladder reaching down to you,

470
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,760
and I am the one extending it.

471
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:06,139
All you have to do is place
the blame where it belongs

472
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,100
and grab on.

473
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,228
You're talking about me
cooperating against Axe?

474
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,729
I am.

475
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,732
Spare us the time and
effort of feigning loyalty.

476
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,986
Just shed that dry, flaking skin

477
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,823
like the reptile you are and
slither away shiny and new.

478
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,533
Tell us
how he steered you.

479
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,784
How he forced you.

480
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,620
How he knew about the bad
ton of unregulated marijuana

481
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,082
and yet made the bank
take the cash on board.

482
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,840
Shit.

483
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,093
You know what?

484
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,637
Life's too fucking
short. Let's do this.

485
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,140
Mr. Wagner, please,
let me represent your interests here.

486
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,891
-It's my job--
-Thank you,

487
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,810
and, respectfully,
you're the best lawyer in the world,

488
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,895
but zip it,
Neal. You'll get paid either way.

489
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,398
Get the papers drawn
up while I clear my throat.

490
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,942
You should probably also
relocate me while you're at it.

491
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,570
I hear Idaho's a nice place

492
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,364
for people with certain beliefs.

493
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,824
Can you be my case officer?

494
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,035
You should put me someplace
where spaghetti marinara

495
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,495
is egg noodles with ketchup.

496
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,289
Will I get to wear a wire?

497
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,126
I hear the batteries make
your balls warm and tingly--

498
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,795
Okay, smart guy.
You can stop fuckin' around.

499
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,714
Why don't you
stop fuckin' around?

500
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,092
This is a closed meeting.
Your presence is improper.

501
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,803
No. What you're
doing here is improper.

502
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,388
You interested in
what he's selling,

503
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,598
or should I take it from here?

504
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,141
I leave it in your
capable hands.

505
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,144
Better learn to slice the
garlic nice and thin for the joint.

506
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,481
Only it's gonna be on top of
Spam for you two, not steak.

507
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,232
Okay. Come on, Neal.

508
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,402
Shut off your meter. He
doesn't need your help.

509
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,737
I don't use a meter.

510
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,073
Bach really owes
me one for this.

511
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,158
I ought to arrest
your ass right now.

512
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,702
If you could,
you would have already.

513
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,622
Besides, I didn't see any
of your cops out there.

514
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,082
You gonna chase
me down the hallway?

515
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,917
'Cause you can't catch me.

516
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,879
She could, maybe. Not you.

517
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,924
Oh,
you will be taken soon enough.

518
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,092
As stipulated by your lawyer.

519
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,843
A straight-up bad
bankin' charge.

520
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,054
The dirty money
got dangled in front of you,

521
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,307
and you hit it like a
rising fuckin' tarpon.

522
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:16,728
And now you're got dead
to rights. How's it feel?

523
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,647
It feels like maybe
I'm gonna start pulling

524
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,358
your boat backwards.
'Cause I'm no tarpon.

525
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,652
I'm a fucking Great White.

526
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,778
Don't you know that yet?

527
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,780
Well. No matter.

528
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,990
Even the biggest get landed.

529
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,785
Yeah,
they end up strung up over the dock

530
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,078
with their bellies sliced open

531
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,872
and people standing around
them smiling for pictures.

532
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,209
That's what I've
always been to you.

533
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,460
A trophy.

534
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,463
The trophy.

535
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,714
You can't make anything,

536
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,925
build anything,
earn anything on your own.

537
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,178
So you try to boost yourself
up by tearing me down.

538
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,431
No,
you said it once a while back,

539
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:57,185
about what happens to a
lawman once he puts the star on.

540
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:01,148
Well, seems you were right.
I am a lawman.

541
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,401
And that star sunk in
deep and reminded me.

542
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,404
It's more than that,
though, isn't it?

543
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,115
There are fights a man
measures himself by,

544
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,783
fights that take more out of him

545
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,202
than even winning
gives him back.

546
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,456
Fights that make
him. Ali had Frazier.

547
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,374
-I have you.
-No, no, no.

548
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,584
I have you.

549
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,085
I'm Ali in this parallel.

550
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,545
Another thing we
can disagree on.

551
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,838
Why, Chuck?

552
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,050
What is it about me that
won't let you break off?

553
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,427
Is it Wendy?

554
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,346
'Cause you know I never
tried to take her from you.

555
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,057
And if I have her now,
you lost her on your own.

556
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,643
I don't need the
fucking reminder.

557
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,103
And I don't know. Not really.

558
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,608
It's something to do with her,
but it's more.

559
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,818
Guys like you--

560
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,028
No, you.

561
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,696
You've accumulated so much

562
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,199
you think laws
don't apply to you.

563
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,034
And I'm not talking
about the laws of man,

564
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,368
the ones written down on paper.

565
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,705
I'm talking about the
immutable laws of the universe.

566
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,665
About fairness and right.

567
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,501
Who says we have
to live by those?

568
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:06,171
Maybe we can create our own,
if we have the audacity.

569
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,965
And who appointed you the
keeper of these cosmic rules

570
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,259
in the first place?
The fucking arrogance.

571
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,178
On my part? You're the
one who just said you created

572
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,014
your own system
of right and wrong,

573
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,098
like some fucking deity.

574
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,100
I didn't presume to that.

575
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,186
I arrived at it.

576
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,812
A Titan steals fire

577
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,899
and gets his liver eaten
every day for punishment.

578
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,109
Another one picks
the wrong side in a war

579
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,071
and has to hold the
world on his shoulders

580
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,989
for all time.

581
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,158
A king tells a secret

582
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,578
and has to push a rock
up a hill for his trouble.

583
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,956
Believe it if you will,
or look for the metaphor in it,

584
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,500
one thing's for sure.
We are not very good

585
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,835
at being fucking happy, are we?

586
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,797
Happy.

587
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,006
What's that?

588
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,883
Family dinners every night?

589
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,176
Playing 18 on the weekend

590
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,179
and going to Nevi's
at Christmas time?

591
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,348
Some version of it.

592
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,767
That the kind of
happy you're aiming at?

593
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,936
No, you know it ain't.

594
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,021
So you gotta aim at me.

595
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,315
Right or wrong.
And when it's wrong,

596
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,901
you gin up some
shit to make it work.

597
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:15,198
Un-fucking-believable!

598
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,202
You actually believe
you're innocent.

599
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,079
Well, I might not have
known until right now

600
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,456
just how badly you
need to go down.

601
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,500
Oh, you're gonna learn just
how innocent I am

602
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,169
when that jury foreman
reads it out in open court

603
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,505
for the whole
fucking world to hear!

604
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,883
Well, we'll see about that,
soon enough.

605
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,094
Yes.

606
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,429
We will.

607
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,186
Tell me one thing.

608
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,105
Who leaked the arrest to you?

609
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,607
Who are you?

610
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:53,528
Kojak with a riding crop up
his ass instead of a lollipop?

611
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,614
Figure it out for yourself.

612
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,842
Are you lonely tonight?

613
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:20,430
Are you out on the road?

614
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,141
I'm headed home

615
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:27,646
To go it alone again...

616
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,650
What I told you before
about using the hate...

617
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,735
it may work for you.

618
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,236
But I should never have said it.

619
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,490
-No?
-No.

620
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,575
The advice I should have
given you about working here--

621
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,078
or anywhere in
this business really,

622
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,664
if remaining resemblant
to the person you are now

623
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,082
matters to you at all--

624
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,335
is what Agatha the
precog tells Anderton.

625
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,005
Run.

626
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,465
Run.

627
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,887
If I see you here again,
it'll be to my benefit.

628
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,847
But I hope I don't.

629
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,522
I'm realizing what I've lost

630
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,941
And what I've left

631
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,110
And taking it home

632
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,029
To go it alone again

633
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,115
After 20 years in the music game

634
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,783
and another few in the pot game,

635
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,369
you'd think I'd already
been screwed more ways

636
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,662
than in the Kama Sutra.

637
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:31,126
But you guys went full
Trudy and Sting on me.

638
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,462
Okay. Here's how
I did what I did...

639
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,214
I'll do what I'm told

640
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:40,593
And buy what I'm sold again

641
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,639
She was enough...

642
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,894
Get us in front
of the grand jury.

643
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,273
The wound that won't heal

644
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:57,736
Is pain I can't feel again

645
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,456
There's no way to say this

646
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,583
without it coming
off as a bit dramatic.

647
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,460
If ever a
situation called for it.

648
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,254
It's time to surrender,
Bobby.

649
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,630
At the heliport.

650
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,718
Chuck got what he
needed to make it official.

651
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,595
I'm on my way.

652
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,790
Sir.

653
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,157
What are we fighting about
this afternoon, Sonny Boy?

654
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,200
Uh....

655
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,495
No, Dad. I just, uh....

656
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,249
Well, shit, old man.

657
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,709
I came over to make
the peace with you.

658
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:40,839
I didn't raise you to
make gestures like that.

659
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,468
I found myself, uh....

660
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,224
Well, I

661
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,060
was on my way to
arrest Bobby Axelrod,

662
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,188
and I found myself
contemplative.

663
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,984
There was one
person I wanted to see.

664
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,903
And it was you.

665
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,864
Good. Ill.

666
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,366
Motherfucker. Sweetheart.

667
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,869
In whatever role...

668
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,997
you're my father.

669
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,750
And all I do

670
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,670
is in reaction to
that in some way.

671
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,339
What about the fact
that I tried to fuck

672
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,092
your entire life's
work the other day?

673
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:30,179
You're willing to
just forget about that?

674
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,726
And the fact that you knew I would,
and used it.

675
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:38,688
You have been
through a terrible ordeal.

676
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:43,318
I watched you almost
accept your own death.

677
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,072
Anybody would come out of
that questioning everything.

678
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,616
Even their loyalties.

679
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,576
If I were you, I wouldn't go in

680
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,163
for the sentimental
reveries just yet.

681
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:59,167
You've had Axelrod in cuffs before,
Sonny.

682
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,045
Doesn't mean
you'll keep him there.

683
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,214
I guess it's possible, Pops.

684
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,841
But I like our odds.

685
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,178
That was supposed to get a
very different reaction out of you.

686
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,639
You were supposed to snap at me.

687
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,391
Call me out for
not believing in you,

688
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,976
but you didn't.

689
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,939
Oh, shit.

690
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,358
You actually have him this time.

691
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,109
That's why you're here.

692
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,822
This is beyond crowing.

693
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,660
You've actually won,
haven't you?

694
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,667
That also means that I
backed the wrong gladiator.

695
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,629
I looked at the situation
from all the angles,

696
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,424
and put my money down on Axe.

697
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,426
And you whupped him.

698
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,805
I guess it's finally happened.

699
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,184
I went and got old.

700
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,986
Bye, Dad.

701
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,663
Bring me my daughter.

702
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,837
Leave her with me.

703
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,298
I need to tell her a few things.

704
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,344
Firstly, your brother

705
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:37,015
may not always be a good man.

706
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,561
But he is indeed...

707
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,189
a very great man.

708
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,752
I wish I was a neutron bomb

709
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,756
For once I could go off

710
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,760
I wish I was a sacrifice

711
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:18,473
But somehow still lived on

712
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:22,685
I wish I was a sentimental

713
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,731
Ornament you hung on...

714
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,984
I guess we all got the call.

715
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,402
Yes, we did.

716
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,743
Even you.

717
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,621
Yes.

718
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,794
For 50 million hands upraised

719
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,130
And open toward the sky...

720
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,686
I wish I was a sailor

721
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,524
With someone
who waited for me...

722
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,651
We're finally working together,
Chuck.

723
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,528
You're a man of your word.

724
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,446
Appears that I am.

725
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,038
I wish I was a messenger

726
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,125
Well, here we are at the
appointed time and place.

727
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,543
Don't gloat, Chuck.

728
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,420
I'll do my level best not to.

729
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,256
No easy task, though.

730
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,594
-You Wagner?
-Yeah.

731
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,179
What's this?

732
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,931
Even when you know it's coming,

733
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,933
that last moment of freedom,

734
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,518
it's hard to leave it behind.

735
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,313
Pull him out of there!

736
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,292
We got nothing.

737
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,502
Where's he at?

738
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,621
I came to the meet
because you texted.

739
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,624
Because I wanted
to look into your eyes,

740
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,376
not make any kind of deal.

741
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,628
My guy wants to
talk to your guy.

742
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,588
Hasn't he done enough?

743
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,714
Why should he?

744
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,424
If you can't see it,
then you really gotta

745
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,842
make the meet happen.

746
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,511
Because Axe has laser vision,

747
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,097
and he will see
exactly what the win is.

748
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,312
Believe I know who our leak is.

749
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,492
You use your
night vision goggles

750
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,703
to help you make your
way along the water?

751
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,621
That's the way the law
really knows someone's in it

752
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,708
for the thrill, you know?
When they get the goggles going.

753
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,418
Yeah,
the law didn't see me because

754
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,877
they're watching the front door.

755
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,462
And not how I get my kicks.

756
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,131
I assure you,
I take no pleasure--

757
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,009
No, no, of course not.
That would be indecorous.

758
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,052
No, it's fine to set a guy up,
lead him to slaughter,

759
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,763
but to laugh... that's the line,
huh?

760
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,766
Yes,
that's the line. I take no joy.

761
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,686
You don't have to believe me,
but it would serve you to do so,

762
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,313
to expand your set of beliefs.

763
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,899
So what would you have me
put my faith in, Mikey boy?

764
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,568
Let's start with some facts.

765
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,737
Then we can segue into faith.

766
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,615
I find it easier to convert
the skeptical that way.

767
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,993
The moment you're
actually indicted,

768
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,871
eight billion of your
money is frozen solid.

769
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:55,541
You probably have five,
600 in your charitable foundation.

770
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,835
Another three-quarters
of a billion offshore.

771
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,588
A few hundred here or there
the government hasn't found yet,

772
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,381
but they will.

773
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,549
And you're facing 25 years

774
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,092
in state and federal
banking charges.

775
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:09,722
You'll want to go to trial,
and you probably will.

776
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,559
But billionaires aren't
that popular right now.

777
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,728
This country's
strangled with inequality,

778
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,522
and you're about to
become the new poster boy.

779
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,901
Your best bet is a plea.

780
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,321
Ten years in state custody
with the possibility of time off

781
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,530
for good behavior.

782
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,782
Lop off another year

783
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,658
for a drug-alcohol
intervention program,

784
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,328
and you're still looking at six.

785
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,038
Can you do six?

786
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,999
Could I?

787
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,460
I don't know.

788
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,545
The pandemic felt like solitary,

789
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,839
and I had cars and planes

790
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,842
and five properties
to choose from.

791
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,763
But every man has to answer
that question for himself.

792
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,807
And then there's running.

793
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:57,686
Roman soldiers on campaign
carried three days' rations

794
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,854
and foraged.

795
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,482
Going to ground with
under a billion liquid

796
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,566
is your equivalent of that.

797
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,901
Okay. So that's the windup.

798
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,444
When do you deliver
the fucking pitch?

799
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,447
The fucking pitch is coming,
and it's nasty, Axe,

800
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,118
a cutter down and breaking
inside the last second.

801
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,495
A real Louisiana
Lightning special.

802
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,830
See, you enjoyed that.

803
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,707
You bring it out of me,
what can tell you.

804
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,920
Look, I won here.

805
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,423
I cut you down. Put you away.

806
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,634
But behind bars?

807
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,344
While that may
be part of Chuck's

808
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,764
Cheryl Tiegs fishnet fantasy,
it's not part of mine.

809
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,851
I don't care. I just
want you gone.

810
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,018
And now you are.

811
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,605
But you see something more,
don't you?

812
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,357
I do.

813
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:47,027
I'll give you 2 billion walk-away
money for Axe Holding,

814
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,155
the bank,
and the asset management arm,

815
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,906
including Taylor Mason Carbon.

816
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,199
We make the deal now,

817
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,951
get it papered
before you're arrested

818
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,035
and barred from selling.

819
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,912
That's a steep
discount you want.

820
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,372
Pennies on the fuckin' dollar.

821
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,958
Guys with sucking chest
wounds should save their breath

822
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,960
and not try to negotiate.

823
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,296
Your billions, they're gone.

824
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,298
No good to you.

825
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,134
Me? I might be able
to reorganize the bank,

826
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,887
keep your investors on
board and restart that business.

827
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,680
And then one day your
buddy the Attorney General

828
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,348
unfreezes my money for you?

829
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,894
I have a white paper that
says this transaction is legal,

830
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,022
because right now
you're not indicted.

831
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,274
You've not been
told you will be.

832
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,067
Your lawyer's not been told.

833
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,652
And even if he freezes it,

834
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,781
I'll find a way to
get it unfrozen.

835
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,872
Long time since I was on
the other side of one of these.

836
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,333
In a real way.

837
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,837
It feels, um...

838
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,591
wow.

839
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,927
So this is what it is to lose.

840
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,512
Okay.

841
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,812
Fine. We do the deal.

842
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,939
With one exception--

843
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,732
Taylor Mason
Carbon. Let them go.

844
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,359
Break 'em off of Axe Cap.

845
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,111
No can do.

846
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,739
I worked with Wendy
and Taylor briefly.

847
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,783
I want them, need them.

848
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,909
That's a deal breaker.

849
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,161
So you get it all?

850
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,539
My money. My
companies. My people.

851
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,873
Win, win, win.

852
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,710
And me nowhere to be found.

853
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,379
Yes.

854
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,882
That I consider a win.

855
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,599
Goddamnit.

856
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,979
I'm sorry.

857
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,107
You know he never would
have if there was any other way.

858
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,150
Mr. Wagner,

859
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:54,780
this leaves you holding the bag,
now doesn't it?

860
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,717
As the CEO of the bank,

861
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,051
you'll be fucking prosecuted.

862
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,469
No.

863
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,180
You see,
I'm just a guy who was offered a CEO job.

864
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,807
I never did take it, though.

865
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,226
See right here? Never signed.

866
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,771
We have carte fucking
blanche on company records.

867
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,856
We'll find the real one.

868
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,983
Oh, shit. No, we won't.

869
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,319
Yeah,
Bobby Axelrod was the cosigner,

870
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,778
so you can get him to testify.

871
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,489
But I don't see that
happening. So good luck.

872
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,325
We can't
waste our time with them.

873
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,452
We need to get the FAA,
recheck the no-fly list Axe was on.

874
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,288
-Look at air traffic.
-No point.

875
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,583
Mrs. Sacker, Mrs. Gramm,

876
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,793
when someone leaves a
burning sack of excrement

877
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,462
on your doorstep and
rings your doorbell,

878
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:55,424
it's best not to stomp it out,
lest you get covered in shit.

879
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:02,431
I used to think it was
a total waste of $60 million.

880
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,849
The third plane?

881
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,476
Of course it's a waste,

882
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,770
just like everything
in the top right corner

883
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,856
of the risk and control matrix.

884
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,316
Right up until you need it.

885
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,526
So how does this work?

886
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:19,948
I'm a little too tall to
fit into a cello case.

887
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,409
Outfitted as a
private cargo jet.

888
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,953
Special container that
houses a regular seat.

889
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,622
You'll be quite comfortable,
I assure you.

890
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,375
Medical instruments on the manifest,
no passengers.

891
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:33,295
You'll board the
chopper to satisfy the tail,

892
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,964
and then pass through
out into a waiting vehicle.

893
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,634
I'll have things taken
care of on the other end

894
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,387
long before you land.

895
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,681
It's good to be the king.

896
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,975
Hall,

897
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,687
you are a true professional.

898
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,774
In other circumstances,

899
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,984
those words coming from you

900
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,363
would actually, uh,
make me smile.

901
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,075
Fuck!

902
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,410
Well...

903
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:09,665
this turned into a tough day,
Rhoades.

904
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,999
I need a drink.

905
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,968
Let's go.

906
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,386
All right.

907
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,074
Whoever was on the tail,
they got beat.

908
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:47,619
It's not their fault,
but never use them again.

909
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,413
This is....

910
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,584
It's done! Fall back!

911
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,462
But start thinking
of the next move,

912
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,715
and the move after because
done does not mean finished.

913
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,592
Not in this case.

914
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,344
Mr. Bach, you made assurances.

915
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,929
You will be hearing from us.

916
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,558
Oh,
I'll be looking forward to it.

917
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,363
Didn't figure he'd leave you behind,
huh?

918
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:26,200
After all that effort,
all that history,

919
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,577
to just ghost you like that?

920
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,079
Guess you bet on a bad pony,
Wend.

921
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,623
Chuck!

922
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,127
Sorry for your loss.

923
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,141
You knew.

924
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,353
I knew? What did I know?

925
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,646
That he wasn't gonna show.

926
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,357
You're acting busted up,
but you were in on it.

927
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,484
You fucking knew it all.

928
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,239
You got here just
in time for the sunrise.

929
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,116
Yeah. It's nice here,
like this.

930
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,452
We can base out of here
while we fight the case.

931
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,747
Do, like, four nights a week,
Thursday to Sunday?

932
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah. Different options
I'm exploring at this time

933
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,211
for defending my liberty.

934
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,546
How different?

935
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:24,007
Oh, you know,
there have been certain developments.

936
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,343
Could turn out
very nicely for us.

937
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,679
Very strong move
I'm thinking of.

938
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,141
You're talking in generalities,
like a...

939
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,394
like a politician or something.

940
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,732
Talk to me like Axe would.

941
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,527
I realized this:

942
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,156
I can't spend my life
being some caged animal.

943
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,366
Just can't.

944
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,493
-Right. We're gonna--
-No.

945
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:56,290
I stay, the truth is,
after the fight, I lose.

946
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,208
They got me. I'm going to jail.

947
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,043
I don't accept that.

948
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,128
You don't have to.

949
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:04,298
I'm not staying and fighting.

950
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,049
I'm getting outta here.

951
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:08,844
Where?

952
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,470
To a place on the Continent.

953
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,724
Where there's no extradition
for certain financial crimes.

954
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,977
Where I'll be able to
monitor the arguments

955
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,104
my lawyers are
making from there.

956
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,566
We will.

957
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,444
Together.

958
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,906
Come with me.

959
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,578
So much of me...

960
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,665
nearly all of me
wants to say yes.

961
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,084
Which part of you is saying no?

962
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:47,007
Look,
being on the run with you...

963
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,302
that part, us together,
like that...

964
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:55,015
I can't think of
anything more exciting,

965
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,392
more enticing, but...

966
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,604
I mean, come on,
Bobby. Leaving my life. My kids.

967
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,231
Think of what that
would do to me,

968
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,942
who it would turn me into.

969
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,199
It would ruin whatever was between us,
eventually.

970
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,577
Because the kind of
woman who'd do that...

971
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,997
the truth is, you wouldn't want
the version of me that would go.

972
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,291
Believe me, I'd take it.

973
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,380
If you stay, I'm in.

974
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,633
Whatever that
means. In all the ways.

975
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,970
Including jailhouse visits,
if it comes to that.

976
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,144
I'm sorry,
I can't let it come to that.

977
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,818
And I can't come with you.

978
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,154
I just can't.

979
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:08,171
If we can't finish it,
we can't start it.

980
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,344
Not now.

981
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,086
Once upon a time

982
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,379
You dressed so fine

983
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,591
Threw the bums a
dime in your prime

984
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,718
Didn't you?

985
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,556
People call say 'beware doll,
you're bound to fall'

986
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,601
You thought they were all

987
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,394
Kidding you

988
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,941
You used to

989
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,527
Laugh about

990
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,696
Everybody that was

991
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,615
Hanging out

992
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:20,410
Now you don't talk so loud

993
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,663
Now you don't

994
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,749
Seem so proud

995
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:29,711
About having to be scrounging

996
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,298
Your next meal...

997
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,057
Robert Axelrod?

998
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,938
Your new passport, sir.

999
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,444
Thank you.

1000
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:07,457
Wilkomme   to Switzerland,
Herr Axelrod.

1001
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,126
Everything is in order.

1002
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,754
How does it feel

1003
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,968
To be without a home?

1004
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,973
Like a complete unknown

1005
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:28,019
Like a rolling stone

1006
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:41,700
Ahh, you've gone to the finest school,
all right

1007
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:45,495
Miss Lonely,
but you know you only used to get

1008
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,372
Juiced in it

1009
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,790
Stark.

1010
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,085
We'll warm it up.

1011
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,713
Yes. We will.

1012
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,966
"Write it on your heart

1013
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,384
that every day

1014
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,429
is the best day of the year."

1015
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,848
Emerson said that.

1016
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,851
And if every day is such,

1017
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,811
then even this, yes,

1018
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,189
this is such a day, too.

1019
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:17,444
This company,
formerly known as Axe Holding Company,

1020
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,779
Axe Asset Management,
and Axe Bank,

1021
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,532
and before that, Axe Capital,

1022
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,367
belongs to me now.

1023
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,207
You'll find I don't much
speak about things that way,

1024
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,458
about who gets what,

1025
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,585
who shined by closing
such and such deal,

1026
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,046
but I think it is important,
crucial even,

1027
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:40,508
to begin by stating in the
most plain terms what this is.

1028
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,887
And what this is...

1029
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,890
is mine.

1030
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,686
Oh, hey, this is Scooter.

1031
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,730
You may come to think
of him as my Wags.

1032
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,441
Better dressed, better mannered.

1033
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,692
Perhaps not quite as much fun

1034
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,361
at an all-you-can-eat
Vegas buffet

1035
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,404
or a mud wrestling
establishment,

1036
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,406
which are things of the past,
anyway,

1037
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:06,534
but still pretty fun.

1038
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,495
You may know I come
from private equity

1039
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,829
and the venture capital world.

1040
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,957
That I've been a
founder and an operator.

1041
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,377
But after the roller coaster
ride the markets have been on,

1042
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,546
I suddenly see
opportunity in equities.

1043
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,507
Unparalleled fucking

1044
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,801
opportunity.

1045
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,890
Anyone who wants
to get wealthy--

1046
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,976
rich,
in your language-- can stay,

1047
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,728
and we can discuss your
place in the new organization.

1048
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:38,233
Otherwise,
now is a good time to leave.

1049
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,782
Last couple years,

1050
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,743
I think I lost my hunger.

1051
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,454
My drive, my reason to get up

1052
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:54,541
and do what the fuck I do.

1053
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:58,003
You just gave it back to me,
Prince.

1054
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:03,967
I'll see you on the
goddamn field of battle.

1055
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,280
Not so fast, you two.

1056
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:42,088
I guess we're Tessio
and Clemenza now.

1057
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,673
Well, that one I've seen.

1058
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,968
Well, only one of them turned
out to be loyal and useful.

1059
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,888
We'll see how that goes with you,
Wagner.

1060
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,682
Right.

1061
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,529
He here? Up in his office?

1062
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,531
Where else he gonna be?

1063
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,492
It is his office, right?

1064
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,661
For now.

1065
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,560
You can't do it, huh?

1066
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:40,563
I worked for a legend.

1067
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:41,439
I'm out.

1068
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,941
Yeah. This place...

1069
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,402
I'm outta here too.

1070
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,534
Team up?

1071
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,245
Done.

1072
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,131
I hope when this all calms down

1073
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,882
and you really look at it,
and me,

1074
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,426
that you won't
even want to leave.

1075
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,762
But the thing of it is,
we can't even if we want to, right?

1076
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,181
You could. You couldn't
work anywhere else,

1077
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,225
and I'd own all you left behind.

1078
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,811
Because you are
now the majority owner

1079
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,895
of Taylor Mason Carbon.

1080
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,772
When I said, "It's all mine,"

1081
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,065
that is what I meant, all.

1082
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,818
Including Axe's
piece of your shop,

1083
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,195
which is the majority piece.

1084
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,780
But this will work
out for both of you.

1085
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,532
I can feel it already.

1086
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,122
When, Mikey boy?

1087
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:44,252
Hmm. When did you decide
to break ranks and betray me?

1088
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,465
Because-- and let's make
sure to let all the Axe enthusiasts

1089
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,799
among us know, going forward,

1090
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,927
you were in lockstep
with me on nailing him.

1091
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,013
Right up until you weren't.

1092
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,308
Well, Chuck,
I was never really in your ranks.

1093
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,642
Never in lockstep.

1094
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,853
We just had a similar
problem for a while.

1095
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,688
Uh-huh.

1096
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,650
Now, you're my problem.

1097
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,612
And you know what
I do to problems.

1098
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,030
Let 'em fester?

1099
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,492
No. I do what I
did to the last guy

1100
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,826
who sat in that chair.

1101
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,203
I get rid of them.

1102
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:22,040
No. I got rid of the
guy in the chair.

1103
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,501
Know how we
know this to be true?

1104
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,472
'Cause I'm the
one sitting in it.

1105
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,557
Not for long, pal.

1106
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,644
Not for fucking long.

1107
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:47,190
You used to ride on a chrome
horse with your diplomat

1108
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:52,320
Who carried on his
shoulder a Siamese cat

1109
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:57,116
Ain't it hard when
you discovered that

1110
00:58:57,158 --> 00:59:02,205
He really wasn't where it's at

1111
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:07,085
After he took from
you everything

1112
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:11,339
He could steal

1113
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,717
How does it feel?

1114
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,222
How does it feel?

1115
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:25,853
To have on your own

1116
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:29,274
With no direction home

1117
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:34,112
Like a complete unknown

1118
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:39,284
Like a Rolling Stone

1119
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:52,005
Ahh, princess on a steeple

1120
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,756
And all the pretty people

1121
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,301
They're all drinkin',
thinkin' that they...

1121
