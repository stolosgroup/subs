1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:04,295
Previously on  Billions...

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,840
The
Olympic Games in 2028

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,717
are awarded to...

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,802
New York City.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,013
-   My guess is,

6
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,515
somewhere inside this
is a direct bribe of sorts.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,308
A quid pro quo.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,893
The Olympics.

9
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,187
You want to be on the
performance coaching team.

10
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,355
To run it.

11
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,857
Use my talents to
turn those athletes

12
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,692
into medal machines.

13
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,360
Done.

14
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,904
I can't stay. You can come with,

15
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,865
but I have to go back
to the St. Regis to pack.

16
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,366
- Pack?
- Before the Games,

17
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,201
I need to spend
time in the mountains.

18
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,204
Yeah, but I thought we
were going to try here. Us.

19
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,874
The Olympics mean
something very different to me

20
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,250
than they do to you.

21
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,211
This is everything
I ever worked for,

22
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,173
and I need you to do the work

23
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,799
and climb for the kiss.

24
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,885
Yes. You're right.

25
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,928
And I will.

26
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,556
Prince
didn't pull this off

27
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,558
all by his lonesome.

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,227
So we separate Prince
from his power base.

29
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,980
Let him fall like the
smoke from the fireworks

30
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,899
drifting down on this fine city.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,400
Prince, let's go. Wake up.

33
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,194
Get your shit on. Time to go.

34
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,155
How cold is it out there?

35
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,867
We're not doing that.
Let's go, come on.

36
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,966
I guess that's
why I hired Gabby Reece.

37
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,634
The worst
thing that can happen

38
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,302
is a person gets comfortable,

39
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,471
and then they think the
world is a comfortable place.

40
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,307
You have to be comfortable
being uncomfortable.

41
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,101
You catch my drift?
I mean, otherwise,

42
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,770
you would think, like,
this pace is running.

43
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,313
But this is a jog.

44
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,149
Well, it's more like a walk.

45
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,317
It's a long run.
It's not a sprint.

46
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,487
Life is a sprint. You
just hope it's a long one.

47
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,655
When I do this for real,

48
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,323
when I run the
original marathon route,

49
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,118
it'll remind people
of doing hard things,

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,328
and the original
meaning of the Games.

51
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,207
The original run into Athens
was to bring a message

52
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,460
about a war that
was finally won.

53
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:54,340
And the messenger, he died
because his cardio was crap.

54
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,885
And you know what? You
haven't won a damn war yet.

55
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,887
Come on! Pick it up!

56
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,032
- All right.
- Okay, thanks.

57
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,093
There he is.

58
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,012
Good to see you, Mike.
We saved a seat for you.

59
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,388
Good to see you.

60
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,390
Very impressive pace. Bravo.

61
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,851
I'm just trying to stay
loose, turn my mind off.

62
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,771
It's the closest thing
I know to meditation.

63
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,565
But this particular run has
a higher purpose, doesn't it?

64
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,902
I want to celebrate what
humans are capable of.

65
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,613
And, yes, when I do this
run in the summer months

66
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,114
before the Games begin,

67
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,283
I hope thousands join
me all around the world.

68
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,035
Millions, even, just to
help welcome the Games

69
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,578
to New York City.

70
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,205
But that is the purpose

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,915
of the traditional run, right?

72
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,416
People all around the world

73
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,335
get to carry the torch
to the destination.

74
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,255
But with you, it
seems very personal.

75
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,423
You seem, some
say, deeply invested,

76
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,259
maybe more than what
people are comfortable with.

77
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,927
So here's a question:

78
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,096
what, if anything, are you
trying to say about yourself?

79
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,389
And I ask that
because these Games

80
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,099
are for all global citizens,

81
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,310
not just for Michael
Thomas Aquinas Prince.

82
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,855
Well, Gayle, I could throw

83
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,357
the famous
Roosevelt quote at you

84
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,858
about getting in the ring.

85
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,777
But instead, I'll give
you some Dusty Rhodes.

86
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,112
Okay.

87
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,780
"Let me tell you
something, Daddy.

88
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,949
"I am the bull of the
woods, and it ain't my dream.

89
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,118
It's the American dream."

90
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,578
Now be careful you don't

91
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,580
accidentally get in the
way of a bionic elbow.

92
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,457
Duly noted. And ouch.

93
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,794
Is that the purpose
of the traditional run?

94
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,880
- That people all around...
-  Wow, look at that.

95
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,632
A couple of bona
fide heroes, huh?

96
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,801
Split times are no joke.

97
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,469
Especially into mile eight.

98
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,554
Really?

99
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,139
And for Prince
to stay with her...

100
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,807
that's no mean feat.

101
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,559
And the guy's got a day job

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,269
with pretty decent remuneration.

103
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,645
They ought to bottle his sweat

104
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,272
and sell it for a million
dollars an ounce.

105
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,149
I'm surprised--
shocked, really--

106
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,568
to see you succumb to
the testosterone-infused

107
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,777
stylings of this guy.

108
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,321
You don't buy into
him carrying the torch

109
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,822
for all of New York City, then?

110
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,490
Oh, yes, of course.

111
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,368
The great man carries
the torch for us all.

112
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,455
Be a real shame if
the bull of the woods

113
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,667
got his big run canceled and
ended up hanging on a hook.

114
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,171
The question is, how?

115
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,218
What's the only thing worse
than not getting what you want?

116
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,263
Getting what you want,

117
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,681
but having it ripped
from your hands.

118
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,352
It's like I hired my own twin.

119
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,817
Anyone know what
"sic 'em" actually means?

120
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,529
It's a command originating
from the order for attack dogs

121
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,575
to seek, to pursue
with lethal focus.

122
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,620
Now, if you own a
great dog, a loyal dog,

123
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,497
a dog that would kill for
you on that command,

124
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,582
as every person here
would for each other,

125
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,251
you're very careful not to
speak that command loosely.

126
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,253
You save those words
for when the target is clear

127
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,630
and the moment is exactly right.

128
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,340
The rest of the time,
you rein them in,

129
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,883
keep them fed but not full,

130
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,010
exercised and ready to go.

131
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,805
Now, why am I giving you
this little canine chalk-talk?

132
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,556
Because the Olympic
Games are going to present

133
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,351
an opportunity
for maximal profits,

134
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,895
and so I want everyone
here to free up some capital.

135
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,314
Sell off that which
you've been holding on

136
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,525
for the same reason
a college senior

137
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,235
holds on to her high
school yearbook,

138
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,237
for sentiment and comfort.

139
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,031
And remember what it was
like when the future was brighter

140
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,575
than a shiny red F-150.

141
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,328
When you say free
up some capital...?

142
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,747
I mean sell the house,
go west and find the gold

143
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,082
before the next guy does.

144
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,458
Games open
a window for sure,

145
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,043
but I don't want to
dump out of great shit

146
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,545
on some flyer.

147
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,839
To respectfully
echo that concern,

148
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,882
maybe some of us
could sit this one out.

149
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,551
I don't mind the bench.

150
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,054
Well, when you own
dogs, you feed them all,

151
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,641
but you save the freshest
meat for those that don't hesitate.

152
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,937
Find the best ways
into new plays,

153
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,815
and I'll back your
move with the main fund.

154
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,320
Targets will be transportation,
recommendation apps,

155
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,031
keycard entry
systems, personnel,

156
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,450
and hospitality start-ups.

157
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,202
Give Airbnb a good scare.

158
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,912
We're allocating
based on performance.

159
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,290
 - Whose book has done the best.
 - I'll be getting into--

160
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,708
Hold that thought.
Philip get first pick.

161
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,084
He's outperformed
everyone lately.

162
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,419
Thanks.

163
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,129
I'll take air travel,

164
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,631
aim to secure official airline
sponsorship for the Games.

165
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,468
I already started
working on Hypersonic,

166
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,760
a new high-tech
passenger airline

167
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,471
that travels 3X
the sound barrier.

168
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,222
I've done the research,
and I'm in the process

169
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,141
of building a
relationship with the CEO.

170
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,518
Good. You can
put Philip in touch.

171
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,022
I'm happy to let
Taylor go first if they want.

172
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,816
Take Hypersonic, I can see
you're emotionally invested.

173
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,445
I'll go with self-driving
cars instead.

174
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,071
Similar sponsorship
opportunities.

175
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,115
But next time I get
first pick, I'll be taking it.

176
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,950
No sympathy.

177
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,455
Okay.

178
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,959
Divvy up the rest.

179
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,089
Now, where my dogs at?

180
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,893
Sic 'em!

181
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,521
I don't think I've
ever actually seen

182
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,189
a rich, powerful
man enjoy it before.

183
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,275
Moments like this, if
you don't actually enjoy it,

184
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,694
what's the darn point?

185
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,032
Where do you go when
you need to breathe a little?

186
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,327
I have a wonderful library
on the first floor of my duplex.

187
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,787
Great old 78 player.

188
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,206
And a 60-year-old
Speyside single malt.

189
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,707
But your family's there.

190
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,668
That makes it all
the more pleasant.

191
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,211
Shit.

192
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,755
Hit me with the real of it.

193
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,007
I'm moving in
with Chelz, my girl,

194
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,219
and she wants me to get
rid my rooms at the Pierre.

195
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,347
I want to make her happy,
but I can't do it, not yet.

196
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,723
I'll move out and in with her,

197
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,226
but I can't actually
let the suite go.

198
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,187
So I was thinking you could let
me put them under your name.

199
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,772
I'd pay, of course,
off the books.

200
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,234
For a host of reasons,
primary among them

201
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,653
that I don't believe this
serves you or your relationship,

202
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,779
I say no.

203
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,615
I also say-- and I mean this--

204
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,326
if you ever find you need
a moment to breathe,

205
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,911
come on over to my place.

206
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,372
There's more than enough
60-year to go around.

207
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,918
I'll do it.

208
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,170
You can put the
rooms in my name.

209
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,755
Really?

210
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,591
I can tell that's what
you need, not a pep talk.

211
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,009
It's like at Brown,

212
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,844
they didn't lecture
you not to do Molly.

213
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,596
Instead, some students
gave you a testing kit

214
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,848
to make sure it's actually
Molly you're doing.

215
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,183
And they hope eventually
you'll just decide to quit.

216
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,894
God fucking bless them.

217
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,438
And you.

218
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,234
Well, I hope you're
enjoying the city, Miss Brett.

219
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,194
Or do you prefer Katerina?

220
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,614
We do not yet know each other.

221
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,449
Then Miss Brett it is.

222
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,284
Thank you very
much for seeing us.

223
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,454
I'm a big, big Olympics person.

224
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,830
- One of my first memories

225
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,999
was watching Klammer
on the downhill.

226
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,792
Couldn't believe the
way he got up in the air

227
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,960
yet stayed on the course.

228
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,087
Inspired me to
try to do the same

229
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,256
in my chosen field.

230
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,800
The Games mean
something like this to so many.

231
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,427
And I never tire of hearing it.

232
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,347
The majesty,
the patriotic pride,

233
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,973
the striving for excellence.

234
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,809
That's all why I
was so glad, at first,

235
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,479
to know that they were
coming to New York.

236
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,357
From my understanding,
you wanted to stop them.

237
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,484
Oh, once I found out who
was bringing them to New York,

238
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,362
and whom he was working
with-- a certain Colin Drache--

239
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,155
then, yes, I took action.

240
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,823
Not to stop the Games.

241
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,452
No, to protect them from
disgrace, from shame.

242
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,581
But this Drache is not the one
person involved with Prince.

243
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,125
He put together a top group.

244
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,420
Every important business
leader in New York.

245
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,173
Surely they are
not all "in on it."

246
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,468
They may not know every
move that Prince has made, but--

247
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,970
Every four years
the rumors start.

248
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,015
This is how I know the
Games are really about to begin.

249
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,142
Oh, no, no, no, no.

250
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,144
Much more than that here.

251
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,688
You have a case to present

252
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,148
against Michael
Prince and his group?

253
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,529
Let me answer
that with a question.

254
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,031
Do you believe an
animal-- a bear, say--

255
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,033
can commit crimes
against nature,

256
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,911
even though that bear is only
doing what he was made to do?

257
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,539
- I do not.
- Ah.

258
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,207
Then you've never
seen such an animal

259
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,710
engaging in an activity
called high-grading, have you?

260
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,170
- Hmm?
- This is when

261
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,214
the bears are in the last
stages of hyperphagia.

262
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,217
They're eating twenty, thirty,
forty thousand calories a day

263
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,053
to ready themselves
for winter's hibernation.

264
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,556
Now in the beginning,
they catch a salmon,

265
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,015
they eat a salmon.

266
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,393
Natural. As intended.

267
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,355
Yes. But towards the end,
the bears are mostly full.

268
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,315
The supply could be
cut off and they'd be fine.

269
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,069
They'd sail through the winter.
But they don't stop eating.

270
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,865
Instead, they become very picky.

271
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,867
The bears grab the
salmon in their mouths,

272
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,494
they turn them inside out,
devour only the brain and skin,

273
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,247
and throw the rest away.

274
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,877
Now, they are gorging on
only the most choice bits,

275
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,588
killing because they
can, because they want to,

276
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,465
not out of need...

277
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:41,761
and leaving a giant pile of
mostly whole, skinned salmon

278
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:45,264
sitting there to rot in the sun.

279
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,770
I'll admit this is a
disturbing image.

280
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,146
It should be.

281
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,648
And Mike Prince is
one of those bears.

282
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,403
Society is the river, the
citizens are the salmon.

283
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,489
And now he wants the Games, too?

284
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,784
It's high-grading.

285
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,625
I understand what you're saying.

286
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,420
I also understand that it means

287
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,049
you don't have any real
evidence of corruption

288
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,801
or anything else.

289
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,928
When you do,

290
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,138
I will act right along with you.

291
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,811
Until then, I move forward.

292
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,863
"Until then, I move
forward"? Come the fuck on.

293
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,824
We break Prince
off from his friends.

294
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,659
That's how he loses the Games.

295
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,118
With a threat to
take their money,

296
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,495
a convincing fucking threat.

297
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,163
- I can think of a few.
- Yeah.

298
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,040
There's one they're
particularly worried about.

299
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,124
Long promised.

300
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,835
Now we have to
make it come true.

301
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,419
We're going to tax their asses.

302
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,004
Yes, we are.

303
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,682
Here they are, the A-Team.

304
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,141
More like
heroes of the city.

305
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,519
They cheered for me
when I walked into Marea.

306
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,020
Some people stood.

307
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,773
That's good. I got
invited to join Augusta,

308
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,859
- which is better.
-  Me too.

309
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,528
We should play a
round. Met Gala?

310
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,196
- Yep.
- Yep.

311
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,323
Love what I'm hearing.
It's what I expected.

312
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,700
Ah.

313
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,036
Miss Brett, welcome.

314
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,163
We are partners
now. Call me Katerina.

315
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,125
Congratulations
on your winning bid

316
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,044
and to this powerhouse
organization.

317
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,714
We're going to put
on a spectacular show.

318
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,008
I particularly love this
one-man torch relay

319
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,259
you have been training for.

320
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,386
This is already
driving huge traffic

321
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,721
to the ICS website.

322
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,556
Well, that was the intention.

323
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,725
We have all the
city's key real estate.

324
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,393
A whole array of
resources, really.

325
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,061
Which is why I have
assembled this group,

326
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,856
so I can deploy each
of their special gifts.

327
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,774
We already have
the entire bid office

328
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,984
converted to headquarters.

329
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,777
We're getting right to work.

330
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,863
Just wait till you see
the extent of the plans

331
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,907
- I have in place.
- Oh, before that.

332
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,199
A word.

333
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,624
Your attorney general is
telling an ugly story of bribery.

334
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,209
Don't they always?

335
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,586
Yes, of course,

336
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,922
as I suggested when
he came to see me.

337
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,592
- He visited you in person?
- He did.

338
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,095
And he had nothing when pressed.

339
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,932
Because, as you know,
nothing untoward happened.

340
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,893
If that reveals itself
to be otherwise,

341
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,186
you and I will be having

342
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,438
a completely
different conversation.

343
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,864
Great job.

344
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,784
First gold medal
of this Olympic era.

345
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,119
- Nice work, guy.
- Use me as your Jim Kiick.

346
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,621
Follow behind
and get your yards.

347
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,289
I will.

348
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,419
- What's the thing?
- Philip nabbed 10% of AutoTelic.

349
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,296
Plus they're donating
500 self-driving cars

350
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,340
for athlete transpo
during the Games.

351
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,050
Huge win.

352
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,219
The compressed timeline
to get the cars ready

353
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,262
means AutoTelic gets the
largest urban beta phase

354
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,806
in the history of
self-driving cars.

355
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,933
Good for all of them.

356
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,938
I need a huge fucking win.

357
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,776
Megan.

358
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,153
Shit.

359
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,489
Superhero stuff right
here in front of me.

360
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,908
Ah, I just worked a little
harder than the other ones.

361
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,326
Here's what I see:

362
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,913
someone with the
rarest of abilities.

363
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,000
And you inspire people.

364
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,584
You take them out
of their day-to-day

365
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,794
and give them an
injection of hope.

366
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,005
- I try.
- But you understand it.

367
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,133
I'm head performance
coach for the Olympics, and...

368
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,093
I'm trying to build out my team.

369
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,803
And I don't want a bunch
of performance shrinks

370
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,346
who haven't been out there.

371
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,849
I mean, the thing is, you
have to really consider

372
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,059
every word when
talking to an athlete

373
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,729
who are trying to perform
at the highest level.

374
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,064
It's one thing to have
a coach yell at us,

375
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,734
but if I let you
into my psyche...

376
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,861
This is exactly
what I need to hear.

377
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,322
And why I want you
to be my partner in this.

378
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,660
I'm in.

379
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,495
Not while I'm playing.

380
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,997
Cool.

381
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,002
That's the sixth generation,

382
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,503
taken at the
beginning of the flight

383
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,797
when we found out that
9.5 Gs was a bit too much.

384
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,466
- G-LOC.
- No.

385
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,301
Too much for the plane.
The fuselage buckled.

386
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,635
Had to punch out.

387
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,304
- Maté?
- No, thanks.

388
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,974
The projections on your
company are off the charts.

389
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,185
Business is secondary.

390
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,394
I know aircraft.

391
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,854
Delta wing design,

392
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,397
new composite materials,

393
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,899
tri-spool configuration.

394
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,734
Commercial travel's at
the stagecoach phase.

395
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,153
Hypersonic will
be like locomotives.

396
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,156
Make the world crossable.
Make things possible.

397
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,908
That's how I got back
from Australia so fast.

398
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,284
And that was just
in the Mini Hype.

399
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,244
Does Mach 2.2.

400
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,623
The Symphony will do
2.8 with 75 souls aboard.

401
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,875
Which is why my firm's
ready to take a big position

402
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,460
at the opening tomorrow,

403
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,004
but I wanted to discuss
a bigger partnership.

404
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,256
Don't want partners.
Don't like them.

405
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,134
Sure, ones who don't know
that the single crystal nickel alloy

406
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,720
that allows your engines to
operate above melting point

407
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,138
is the key to your tech.

408
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,390
You know about
high-bypass turbofans.

409
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,476
My principal just brought
the Olympics to New York,

410
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,437
and we need the ability
to fly in teams, fans, fast,

411
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,730
from far and wide.

412
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,524
- From Tokyo in eight hours--
- Six--

413
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,068
Once you start flying
passengers, of course.

414
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,986
But before that, you'll
need a bigger market cap,

415
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,446
which will give you
freedom with your board.

416
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,323
- I can give all that to you.
- How?

417
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,075
By making Hypersonic
the official airline

418
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,618
of the New York Games.

419
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,620
Fuck me.

420
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,583
We've got a hell of a lot to
talk about, my new friend.

421
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,418
Sure you don't want a maté?

422
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,878
Sure, I'll take one.

423
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,464
Azucar or amargo?

424
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,101
Gotta whip it. Whip it good.

425
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,478
It's hard to get
the state legislature

426
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,689
to go against the people whose
money put them in their seats.

427
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,233
That's why they call it
whipping the vote. Never easy.

428
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,069
Plus, we only need the
threats, not the action.

429
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,863
It's got to be convincing.

430
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,781
If we can get this
cabal of Prince's

431
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,449
to believe we're
finally going to close

432
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,285
the carried interest loophole...

433
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,162
And that all their capital gains

434
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,580
will suddenly be
considered income

435
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,789
at the state level, too.

436
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,791
That's a 22% tax hit for them.

437
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,002
Cap gains is
their very lifeblood.

438
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,920
Truth is, the
people will love this.

439
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,922
We just have to remind
our state reps of it,

440
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,050
that there's some things more
important than deep pockets.

441
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,136
- How do you do that?
- Well, Dave,

442
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,596
some things haven't changed

443
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,348
since Hugh Carey put
on his first straw boater.

444
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,688
You go into their world,
you speak their language,

445
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,773
you solve their problems.

446
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,984
You offer them friendship.

447
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,320
Albany is as Albany ever was.

448
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,696
Instead of duckpin bowling,

449
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,282
you show up just when
they need the help,

450
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,492
when their constituents
are about to rebel

451
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,037
because their property
taxes have been raised.

452
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,039
And you help remind
those constituents

453
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,459
just how powerful
their representative is.

454
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,544
And, of course, you
do the bandstand circuit

455
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,381
of bar mitzvahs, confirmations,
christenings and the like.

456
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,343
Sometimes, you recreate
with these fine folks,

457
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,930
up in the deer
stand or on the lake.

458
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,974
And, most crucially...

459
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,560
you feel their pain.

460
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,287
So I know you must've
anticipated this part,

461
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,414
even as we scare
them with the state tax,

462
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,250
they don't have to pull
support of the Games.

463
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,043
They're rich enough.
They can move themselves

464
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,920
and their firms out
of state to avoid it.

465
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,173
Ah, now we're talking
about the interstate compact.

466
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,508
- Yep.
- Which is why

467
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,051
you're going to
rope the governors

468
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,928
of neighboring and
other likely states

469
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,181
into a dinner to
make that compact.

470
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,516
They're not going
to agree to something

471
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,351
as jacked up as
that over dinner,

472
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,103
no matter how good the wine is.

473
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,063
They don't have to.

474
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,357
They don't even need to know
why they're coming to dinner.

475
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,110
They just need to come,
so give them a good reason.

476
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,198
Your guy's going to want
to be there, believe me,

477
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,533
or he'll be caught out.

478
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,118
We're bringing an antitrust case

479
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,828
against medical monopolies.

480
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,456
These bloodsuckers slowed
down essential testing,

481
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,625
shunted off patient care.

482
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,503
They made money
off the pandemic.

483
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,255
Fuck Big Health!

484
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,090
Well, it's a slam dunk
with your constituents,

485
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,633
so you'd better
get your boss there.

486
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,636
And two other governors
have already committed.

487
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,805
And it's going to be
a hell of a meal too.

488
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,140
Yeah.

489
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,641
So I'll see you there.

490
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,648
Hypersonic. Big plans for them.

491
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,066
They're positioned
and ready to go.

492
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,276
The elevator pitch is:

493
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,485
faster than the Concorde,

494
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,987
more accessible than Jet Blue,

495
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,238
and safer than
your mother's Volvo.

496
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,323
Do I have your blessing?

497
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,575
- You seem convinced.
- I am.

498
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,160
Then I am.

499
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,340
You know the "four out of
five dentists surveyed" thing

500
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,633
about Trident being
better for your teeth?

501
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,344
Apparently I'm
the fifth dentist.

502
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,637
- Meaning?
- We need to hold up a sec.

503
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,181
On Hypersonic.

504
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,640
I haven't been able
to independently verify

505
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,309
the tech claims
in their literature.

506
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,352
I see.

507
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,312
Well, we can't wait.

508
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,981
I got clearance, and I want to
size up before the stock moves.

509
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,483
The sizing you're suggesting

510
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,234
goes outside usual
risk parameters.

511
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,861
Because we are-- I am--

512
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,905
taking into account guaranteed
growth from the Games.

513
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,700
Guarantees don't even work
when you buy mangoes online.

514
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,536
Look, big positions
lead to big wins.

515
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,331
Is the big win on
Hypersonic, or against Philip?

516
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,506
I'm tempted to stand here
like Siddhartha until you relent.

517
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,469
Sidd's father knew the kid
would stand there until he died.

518
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,054
You got more Govinda in you.

519
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,472
So we both know
you'll give it up

520
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,973
the second you get
lightheaded from hunger.

521
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,308
Oh, and the fifth dentist?

522
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,976
He caved and agreed
with the other ones.

523
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,395
We're completing the buy.

524
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,743
- It's me.
-   Good evening, sir.

525
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,079
Well, uh, good day
to you, I suppose.

526
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,206
You're a tough man to reach.
Where the heck have you--?

527
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,707
Sat phone's only
on an hour a day.

528
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,085
Makes the untraceable
more untraceable.

529
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,422
- Protocol, you know.
- Fine, listen...

530
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,216
if there were inquiries,
would our status be solid?

531
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,759
Quite.

532
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,470
Untraceable. Everything's
locked, my friend.

533
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,765
Mm-hmm. Most everyone
who's fallen thought that.

534
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,767
Please. Amateurs.

535
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,310
Right.

536
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,312
You know her better than I do.

537
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,731
Can I count on Katerina
Brett to stay locked

538
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,483
even if there's noise?

539
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,820
Oh, Michael, Michael...

540
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,324
Miss Brett is a mercenary type

541
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,743
who cares about a
proper Games above all.

542
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,621
She will not
countenance impropriety.

543
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,582
You understand?

544
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,794
So, in that way, yeah, you
can count on her absolutely.

545
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,222
- Boss--
- Oh, none of that. No, no.

546
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,558
You're no junior.

547
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,810
I paraphrase the modern
philosopher Steve Parish:

548
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,146
I am not the boss.
You are not the boss.

549
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,274
The situation, that's
the damn boss.

550
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,775
I didn't read
Parish at university.

551
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,111
Well, philosophy
was his sideline.

552
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,864
His main gig was lead
roadie for the Grateful Dead.

553
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,950
And his experience
on that long, strange trip

554
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,703
taught him, you
think you're the boss

555
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,205
right until the car breaks down.

556
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,915
At which point, it is revealed

557
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,708
the carburetor is the boss.

558
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,462
Well, right now, the situation
is an uncooperative boss

559
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,047
who goes by the name
of Governor Sweeney.

560
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,382
He has a conflict and
won't attend the dinner.

561
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,092
He is willing to
come a different night.

562
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,553
No, that's the complication,
not the situation.

563
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,555
The situation is,
we need him there.

564
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,849
That's the driver.
That's the boss.

565
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,935
That's why I'm
bringing it to you.

566
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,478
Yeah.

567
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,316
You know, I bet old Steve
Parish would recognize

568
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,028
that Sweeney is Buridan's ass...

569
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,030
caught between hay and water,

570
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,282
equally hungry and thirsty.

571
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,451
We have to convince
him to come our way,

572
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,537
or risk ending up dead.

573
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,458
...for that report.
Let's do more on this.

574
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,960
Our emerging action segment...

575
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,629
-  Whoa.

576
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,464
You didn't just go
big on Hypersonic,

577
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,882
you went Snake River Canyon big.

578
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,175
I'm familiar.

579
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,510
Magic Valley region
of southern Idaho.

580
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,053
It's more of an Evel
Knievel reference.

581
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,388
The daredevil.

582
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,681
I've kept myself in
the dark about him

583
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,058
because his politics were...

584
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,476
The suits, though.

585
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,186
I'll admit I like
the suits. Colorful.

586
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,564
He tried to jump it. The canyon.

587
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,774
Made him the most famous
man in America for a summer,

588
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,401
Ali excepted.

589
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,987
I assume Ali is always excepted
from statements like that.

590
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,405
The problem was,

591
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,116
Snake River Canyon
can't be jumped.

592
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,618
Not by a motorcycle.

593
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,161
So Evel built himself a
steam-powered rocket

594
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,372
called the Skycycle
X-2 and tried to fly over.

595
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,041
And instead, the most
famous man in America...

596
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,459
Ali excepted.

597
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,378
...became the biggest
joke in America.

598
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,923
Whole nation watched
that Skycycle malfunction,

599
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,426
trip the parachute, and
Evel drift to the bottom.

600
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,844
His rep never recovered.

601
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,887
And you think
Hypersonic is the Skycycle.

602
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,889
I think it's unproven and
untested in just the same way.

603
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,933
And you came in here as
a compatriot to warn me,

604
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,768
not as a competitor
trying to dislodge me

605
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,270
from a winning position, sure.

606
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,771
This doesn't have
to be a competition.

607
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,398
If that were true, you
wouldn't be standing there.

608
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,858
I may not be rooting
for you to beat me,

609
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,359
but I am not rooting
against you, either.

610
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,902
A big win for you
won't do me any harm,

611
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,696
but you will screw everyone
if you take a big loss.

612
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,198
True in theory, yet
unlikely in practical terms.

613
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,992
You and I both know
your position is way too big.

614
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,493
For you maybe.

615
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,579
That's fine. Stay
safe at street level.

616
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,539
But as Mr. Knievel
might have put it,

617
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm gonna rev my
engines and jump.

618
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,642
House rules?

619
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:28,521
Uh, this contains
certain unmentionables,

620
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,399
which will remain just that.

621
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,276
Keep my paws off
the top drawer. Got it.

622
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,986
No, no. The whole highboy.

623
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,488
And the armoire.

624
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,449
And the bottom
shelf in the bathroom.

625
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,659
And the top shelf
in the bathroom.

626
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,661
And the cabinet over the toilet.

627
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,579
I'll just steer clear of
the bathroom altogether.

628
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,956
Not that I'll ever be here
anyway, but of course.

629
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,501
I'll reimburse you on
Venmo in varying amounts,

630
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,170
balancing it out
every three months.

631
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,506
Under "what it's for,"
it'll say "sports bet."

632
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,299
Ooh, better mark those private.

633
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,010
Your gal could be stalking
your Venmo if she's suspicious.

634
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,763
- Stalking Venmo is a thing?
- It is.

635
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,682
Innovation sucks.

636
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,316
Could I maybe get
your POV on something?

637
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,568
It's slightly sketch.

638
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,780
"Slightly sketch" is
my nom de guerre.

639
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,281
You know what?

640
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,117
It was more of
an inside thought.

641
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,743
I get that.

642
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,162
I don't have as many
of those as I used to.

643
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,664
But I get it.

644
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,754
Governor, I need you
in the lineup tonight.

645
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,841
Oh, Chuck, I have to deal
with the Big Ugly tonight.

646
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,010
Everything the state legislature
hasn't voted on tonight gets--

647
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,138
Yes, reconciled,
voted on, decided.

648
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,806
- And you need to ratify.
- So you see--

649
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,809
No, I see that
you can do it all.

650
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,019
The Big Ugly doesn't wrap

651
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,522
until the wee small
hours of the morning,

652
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,691
and not even Nelson
Riddle could arrange it

653
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,901
so this excuse works on me.

654
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,155
And it is better for
you to be at this dinner.

655
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,740
If you don't go,

656
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,075
you will miss out on
this giant antitrust case,

657
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,910
which'll look bad for you.

658
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,835
I'm not as smart as you, Chuck.

659
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,420
No.

660
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,839
So I can't outthink you.

661
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,967
So I got to use
my instincts on this.

662
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,969
And they're telling me
not to go to this dinner

663
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,679
because you seem
to want me there.

664
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,722
Why?

665
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,432
Huh? Why there? Why then?

666
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,893
I just feel like you're
setting me up for something.

667
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,394
It's a trick,

668
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,396
and I'm just going to end
up looking like a schmuck.

669
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,607
- So, no, thanks.

670
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,150
Fine. Don't go.

671
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,987
In fact, yes, I'll admit
it, your gut is right.

672
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,655
It might be best for
you to leave it to me

673
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,032
and the other governors.

674
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,241
Talk soon, pally.

675
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,452
- Wait. Hold it.
- Mm-hmm.

676
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,954
That was too easy.

677
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,748
You asked me to come
so I'd feel included,

678
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,125
but you follow up here
so I couldn't say later

679
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,711
that you should have told
me it was important to be there.

680
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,130
Ah-ha, you-- you
don't want me to go.

681
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,799
And if I don't go,

682
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,634
I'm going to end up
looking like a schmuck.

683
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,762
- Ah.

684
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,223
Is that what I really want?

685
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,986
Ooh, wait--

686
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,655
- It actually works.
- Yeah!

687
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,698
- Wild!

688
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,367
The night you gave this to me...

689
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,828
It was the night before the
first company went public.

690
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,497
I found it in some
Sharper Image catalog,

691
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,332
or Hammacher Schlemmer, maybe.

692
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,668
The thought of us being like
those characters in   Wall Street

693
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,169
was too funny to me.

694
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,673
We were too nervous to eat.

695
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,758
Never opened it.
Glad I kept this thing.

696
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,969
I mean, that would be sweet,

697
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,637
but I know you had
someone buy 20 of them

698
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,180
and stash them in
every home, just in case.

699
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,849
I still love that you
brought it out now.

700
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,225
Damn.

701
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,644
Well, I haven't ever
used it, any of them.

702
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,855
I know that too.

703
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,565
You're romantic.
Always have been.

704
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,027
Let me prove it to you.

705
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,529
Move in.

706
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,991
Move your stuff in, at least.

707
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,951
Forget a hotel, or
some other apartment,

708
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,870
on your trips here
for the Games.

709
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,207
I'm here now. What
more do you need?

710
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,209
I need it all.

711
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,670
You know that's the
reason I did the thing, right?

712
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,046
Got the Games
here in the first place?

713
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,632
No, you did it to
replenish the energy

714
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,551
and relevance coffers
of New York City,

715
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,011
along with the actual ones.

716
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,721
Yeah. Both.

717
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,057
I'm not the kind of person
who would ever assume

718
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,601
that level of gesture is for me,

719
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,894
even from you.

720
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,979
Which is why you warrant it.

721
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,232
And now you don't
have to assume.

722
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,579
We're a quorum.
Good. Let's begin.

723
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,874
I only came because you said
our futures were in the balance.

724
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,169
Oh, your lives are about
to change in a brutal way.

725
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,049
The carried interest
loophole is about to be closed.

726
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,055
Okay,
Rhoades, sure it is.

727
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,557
You know, this
happens every few years,

728
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,185
but there's never the
political will to pass it.

729
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,563
Student loan forgiveness.
Free universal health care.

730
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,732
There are a lot of big
ideas in flux right now,

731
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,443
but the loophole
isn't one with teeth.

732
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,279
Ah-ha, but tonight is
a very special night.

733
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,282
Have you ever
heard of the Big Ugly?

734
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,117
No?

735
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,119
Well, it's the last night
of the legislative session,

736
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:39,457
when all outstanding business
is voted on and passed.

737
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,835
You see, the Assembly
can't call it a night until it all is.

738
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:46,089
And tonight there is an
item that I have jammed

739
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,634
into a certain bill that
will also be passing:

740
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,679
closing the carried
interest loophole.

741
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,263
You fucking kidding me?

742
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,140
- Jesus Christ.
-  Hold on, gang.

743
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,184
No need to sweat
through your Speed Stick.

744
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,980
Loophole closes, it's easy
enough to move a residence

745
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,357
or office or a server to
Jersey or Connecticut,

746
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,776
or even Pennsylvania
for tax filing purposes,

747
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,695
because as Chuck well knows,

748
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,239
without a little something
called an interstate compact,

749
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,491
meaning if those
other states don't agree

750
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,368
to closing the loophole too...

751
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,204
we're in the clear.

752
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,680
What do you think they're
agreeing to right now?

753
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,181
Those governors,

754
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,642
with my second-in-command
locking it all in.

755
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,519
Oh fuck.

756
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,647
Yeah.

757
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,066
So you fund managers can
kiss your cap gains rate goodbye

758
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,736
and suck on straight income tax.

759
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:53,906
But what's another 22% in
taxes between friends, huh?

760
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,241
Between city, state and federal,

761
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,745
this now brings
you right up to 50%.

762
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,538
Oh, and you guys
who just invest,

763
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,416
don't think they won't pass
the pain along to you in fees.

764
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,253
A few billion bucks
between you all...

765
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,838
next year alone.

766
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,716
Welcome to fucking Cuba, kids.

767
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:16,054
But you're showing
us before it closed.

768
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,057
That's no accident.

769
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,395
Lazarra, you must be one
tough out at Russian roulette.

770
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:28,066
So, what do we need to do
to get the bullet out of the gun?

771
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,162
Whoo! Yeah!

772
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,165
"I've seen better tennis
playing in a tampon commercial."

773
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,085
What the fuck?

774
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,045
Crap.

775
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,297
I needed to unplug.

776
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,092
Had to get away from
my roommate, you know?

777
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,802
Last time I had a roommate

778
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,179
was Chuck Sheen
at Promises in Malibu.

779
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,099
I don't have a roommate either.

780
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,184
I needed...

781
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,603
I needed to think.

782
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,146
Or not think.

783
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,316
What are you stressing
over? You're 12.

784
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,238
You want to talk it out?

785
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,242
Unpopular opinion:

786
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,994
Youth makes stress
worse, not better.

787
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,623
Like, I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing

788
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,208
with a certain work matter.

789
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,584
I don't know if I
should trust myself.

790
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,712
Ah, a real problem.
Thus, the Cheetos.

791
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,256
Yeah.

792
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,134
I found something on
Hypersonic, and it's bad.

793
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,136
Full on, not good, bad.

794
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,263
But Taylor doesn't
want to hear that shit.

795
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,722
That's been made
abundantly clear.

796
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,932
So I don't know what to do.

797
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,225
I've already pushed.

798
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,812
They're the genius, and I'm 12.

799
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,605
But this time they're wrong.

800
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,482
Is there a trade I can kill?

801
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,067
Too late. It's locked.

802
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,237
People who really
know about investing--

803
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,655
and I'm not talking about

804
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,657
cocktail party expert
bullshitters like me,

805
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,908
I mean real operators--

806
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,785
say, the bigger the position,

807
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,079
the more stress there
is on the research.

808
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,831
And if that research
shows a crack,

809
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,958
you better fucking
act on it ASAP.

810
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,085
If you freeze in the
moment, you're a corpse.

811
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,213
I can do it for you,
but the truth is,

812
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,299
you can't let your boss
eat a giant shitburger.

813
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,634
In the end, they will blame you.

814
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:24,015
You've got to have the
courage to tell Taylor yourself.

815
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,864
Is this like a way for you
to sort of hedge your bet?

816
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,365
This place?

817
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,493
Because I was in a
relationship a while back.

818
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,703
We moved in together,

819
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,663
but we each kept a
locked-drawer file cabinet

820
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,541
in the name of privacy
and independence.

821
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,377
Some real Edgar Allan
Poe shit started happening

822
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,838
about what was in
each other's drawer.

823
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,174
I'm not going to say that's
why it didn't work out...

824
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,009
but it didn't work out.

825
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,928
I guess I'm saying,

826
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,348
hedging's for work, not this.

827
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,809
And if I do it again, it'll
be open drawers only.

828
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,394
Not locked.

829
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,574
Yeah.

830
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,201
Where have you been?

831
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,078
The whole world just blew up.

832
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,916
I need you to look past
my glowing complexion

833
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,709
and focus on what
you need to hear.

834
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,544
You're not acting on logic.

835
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,630
What am I acting on?

836
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,173
Jealousy.

837
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,758
The Hypersonic
investment is totally fucked,

838
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,926
and so are we.

839
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,719
Fucked how?

840
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,264
A small aerospace
company of a different name--

841
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,515
a front for Hypersonic--

842
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,184
secretly tested the technology.

843
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,770
This highly pressurized
super stratosphere shit.

844
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,105
- And?
- Dalton's Law,

845
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,606
Graham's Law, Henry's Law.

846
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,732
There are major problems

847
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,484
with their tech and
aviation physiology.

848
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,112
Static pressure at
the altitude they fly,

849
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,905
resulting in pulmonary
hypertension,

850
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,324
clotting, embolisms.

851
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,243
They're trying to fix
it, but it'll take years.

852
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,161
And when people find out...

853
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,621
Here.

854
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,047
Then "bad" is the right word.

855
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,340
How deep is this link buried?

856
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,175
It took you long
enough to find it.

857
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,803
Don't even think about
pinning this "garbahge" on me.

858
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,138
I felt the spidey
senses tingling.

859
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,514
I tried to come to you.

860
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,641
You were having some
space cowboy moment.

861
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,855
You're right. Crap.

862
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,566
I got sucked in by that
Chuck Yeager-wannabe flyboy.

863
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,277
If I found it,
everyone else will.

864
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,570
Soon.

865
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,779
What do you want to do?

866
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,072
The second we make a move,

867
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,615
we'll alert the market.

868
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,409
It'll take a split second
to connect the dots

869
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,661
from us to MPC to the
Olympics back to Hypersonic.

870
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,621
This fucking stock
will go down to a price

871
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,832
that represents the company's
office furniture and phones.

872
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,417
There's no way to trade out
without taking a massive loss.

873
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,501
Yeah, no.

874
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,170
But sitting on it
could be even worse.

875
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,422
We're gutting
ourselves either way.

876
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,974
Yeah Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn

877
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,435
Now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro

878
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,355
- But I'll be 'hood forever

879
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,815
And since I made it here
I can make it anywhere

880
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,692
Yeah, they love me Everywhere

881
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,736
- Sorry to barge.
- Couldn't reach you.

882
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,489
Didn't want to be reached.
The phone was off for a reason.

883
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,784
Took it to my stashbox
560 State Street

884
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,244
Catch me in the kitchen like
A Simmons whippin' pastries

885
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,499
And so it's clear that
there was a conspiracy

886
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,542
to bring the Games to New York

887
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,838
by whatever underhanded method
was deemed most expedient.

888
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,423
Had we known,

889
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,425
and I speak for all
of us on this stage,

890
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,053
we never would have been
party to such malfeasance.

891
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,596
Yes.

892
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,391
We know Michael
Prince led the effort

893
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,143
and engaged in these
actions by himself.

894
00:39:56,185 --> 00:40:00,064
These men and women
were unknowingly brought in

895
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,567
to an attempt to commit
bribery at a very high level.

896
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,071
You got to be kidding me, Mike.

897
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,572
It's B.S., Andy.

898
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,658
Every friend
who betrayed you,

899
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,910
I'll hunt each and every one of
them down and skin them alive.

900
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,079
I'll do it because I want
to, and I'll do it for you.

901
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,416
Yeah, I appreciate it, but no.
I'm going to need them later.

902
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,252
Look, this is bad,

903
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:24,088
but it's not over till
the ICS says it is.

904
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,298
I need to talk to Katerina.

905
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,276
Thanks.

906
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,322
Not even Dollar Bill could help
me pawn it off anonymously.

907
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,283
No one wanted the
block? Spartan-Ives?

908
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,826
The Sovereign Wealth Funds?

909
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,454
- Some dumb Third World despot?
- They smelled it.

910
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,290
We're going to have to
wait until the market opens,

911
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,083
try to bleed it off
share by share.

912
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,418
No. We can't do anything.

913
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,961
Our hands are tied
as long as Hypersonic's

914
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,629
bound to the Olympics.

915
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,800
You going to tell Prince?

916
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,302
What?

917
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,262
That I fell prey to
first instinct fallacy

918
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,889
like some rube stumbled
on the monte table

919
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,348
along the midway?

920
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,731
- You outplayed me this time.

921
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,399
I pray to the Good
Lord in heaven

922
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,234
this is the last time
we have to hondle.

923
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,444
You're welcome, Todd.

924
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,821
As long as we're square.

925
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,698
That we are.

926
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,326
Thank you.

927
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,287
- Well, they did their part.

928
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,039
Yep, I guess I
have a bill to pull.

929
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,002
Or we let it go to a
vote, see if it passes.

930
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,339
The Big Ugly's on our side.

931
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,174
If it goes through,

932
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,718
it would be New York's
most aggressive wealth reform

933
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,804
since FDR was
bankrolling La Guardia.

934
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,599
Could become a test
case for the nation.

935
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,184
The world.

936
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,477
Mm-hmm.

937
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,646
Oh, that's fucking tempting.

938
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,814
So I say we clock
out for the night.

939
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,441
Leave it to fate.

940
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,362
No.

941
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,281
No, if I do that,

942
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,699
break my word to this camarilla,

943
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,952
I lose all future leverage.

944
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,038
And your future in the
public sector goes extinct.

945
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,707
Without an actual
interstate compact,

946
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,709
which was really just
a fancy-tasting dinner,

947
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,878
the whole thing's
toothless anyway, and...

948
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,757
and I have to be
honorable to my word.

949
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,803
Even in this. So we pull it.

950
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,559
And then we take the office
out for a celebratory pop.

951
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,688
Pull the damn thing.

952
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,566
Yanking like Pee
Wee Herman himself.

953
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,408
We can work through this
and still do great things together.

954
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,576
You're looking at the only man

955
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,536
who can bring the
Olympics to New York.

956
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,541
- Baseless charges.
- Utter bullshit.

957
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,169
Katerina, standing
against these tactics

958
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,298
is the only way we can protect
the Games from real corruption.

959
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,426
You should refer
to me as Miss Brett.

960
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,761
I gave this a chance to go away,

961
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,681
but I am afraid the New
York Games are tainted now.

962
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:24,727
My statement is about
to go up on the ICS site.

963
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,563
After an unfortunate
series of developments,

964
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,274
the ICS has come
to the conclusion

965
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,942
that the 2028 Games

966
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,903
can no longer be
held in New York City.

967
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,949
Fortunately, after talking to
the organizers in Los Angeles,

968
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,619
they will be ready
to host the Games,

969
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,080
with brand-new sponsors
and renovated stadiums.

970
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,833
Man, that sucks
for our Mikey Prince.

971
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,044
Yes, it does.

972
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,924
But it doesn't suck for us. Me.

973
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,135
This news is our boarding
pass out of our fucked situation.

974
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,304
We can make a statement
saying that we're exiting our position

975
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,639
because Hypersonic
will no longer be

976
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,474
the official airline of
the New York Games,

977
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,142
since L.A. will make
their own airline deal.

978
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,769
We're going to take a hit.

979
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,686
Damn right we are.

980
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,647
But 10, 15%, not 80.

981
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,523
This will be the story long
enough for us to evacuate

982
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,983
before the real news gets out.

983
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,902
That their planes will
fucking hospitalize you?

984
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,445
Exactly.

985
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,908
I figured there might
be one person at this company

986
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,160
who wasn't upset the
Games just went bye-bye.

987
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,162
I also figured

988
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,165
you'd need help unloading
the shares at the open.

989
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,293
Yes, another set of
hands would be good.

990
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,629
Good. These hands
are gonna start

991
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,422
by getting some coffee going.

992
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:54,191
It's not the particular
memories in this place.

993
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,695
It's the idea that this is
where my memories happened.

994
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,029
But now, new memories.

995
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,783
And no secret rooms.

996
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:06,412
Or secret compartments out here.

997
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,081
Or up there.

998
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,916
That's the idea.

999
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,419
Never did it before.
Never even tried.

1000
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,421
Well, we'll try together.

1001
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,506
Yeah, we will.

1002
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,883
All in. It's time.

1003
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,762
Before you got to go Go, go, go

1004
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,307
I wanted you to know
Know, know, know

1005
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,893
You're always on my mind

1006
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,062
- Hi.
- Hi.

1007
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,023
I'd ask how it went, but I
saw the announcement.

1008
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,859
Yeah.

1009
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,235
Where you going?

1010
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,821
My hotel. I need to
pack. It's an early flight.

1011
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,240
I can change that, you
know. It is my plane.

1012
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,743
I know, but I need to
get home and organized.

1013
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,244
I missed too much time already,

1014
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,997
and I need to start booting
things back up in L.A.

1015
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,083
- Ouch.
- Sorry.

1016
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,668
But...

1017
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,924
I guess we're back
where we started.

1018
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,260
In some ways.

1019
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,137
In others, not.

1020
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,557
Our thing's been dormant,
switched off for years...

1021
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,769
because of distance.

1022
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,730
Not just distance, you know?

1023
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,026
It's switched back
on now, unless...

1024
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,819
I hate to say it,

1025
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,031
but if this grand gesture of
yours was really about us--

1026
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,574
It was, as I said.

1027
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,035
I was trying to bend the world
to my specifications to do it.

1028
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,287
Well, that's the way it goes
when you try and do that.

1029
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,830
It doesn't work.

1030
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,957
You used to say that
in the beginning with us.

1031
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,542
Before.

1032
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,544
It's gone my way plenty since.

1033
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,505
Yeah, I can see that.

1034
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,301
But the world's a
beast sometimes.

1035
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,263
You said you'd
be willing to travel

1036
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,974
before you knew it was
going to be here, so...

1037
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:54,561
Of course. I'll be in Colorado,
then L.A. every weekend.

1038
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,897
Or every other.

1039
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,566
Good.

1040
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,282
I'll see you next weekend.

1041
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,992
For sure.

1042
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,078
Well, not next weekend,
'cause the fallout from this

1043
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,704
is going to be...

1044
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,000
I know.

1045
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,587
I'll see you when I see you.

1046
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,132
Call me when you get this

1047
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,391
Before you got to go Go, go, go

1048
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,769
I wanted you to know
Know, know, know

1049
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,857
Hey!

1050
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,358
I be Spike'd out

1051
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,609
I could trip a referee

1052
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,986
Tell by my attitude

1053
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,821
That I'm most Definitely from

1054
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,490
- In New York - Hey, ah-ha

1055
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:52,327
Concrete jungle Where
dreams are made of

1056
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,997
There's nothing You can't do

1057
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,833
- Yeah - Now you're in New York

1058
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,043
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha

1059
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,422
These streets will make
you Feel brand-new

1060
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,174
Big lights will inspire you

1061
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,927
- Let's hear it for New
York - You're welcome, OG

1062
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,890
- New York, New
York - I made you hot...

1063
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,559
Catch me at the X with
OG At a Yankee game

1064
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,312
Shit, I made the Yankee hat
More famous then a Yankee can

1065
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,855
You should know I bleed blue

1066
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,064
But I ain't a Crip, though

1067
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,733
But I got a gang of...

1068
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,484
Walking with my clique Though

1069
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,861
Welcome to the melting pot

1070
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,529
Corners where We selling rock

1071

Home of the hip-hop

Yellow cab, gypsy cab
Dollar cab, holla back

1073
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,368
For foreigners It ain't fair

1074
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,329
They act like they
forgot How to act

1075
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,539
Eight million stories
Out there in the naked

1076
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,417
City is a pity Half
of y'all won't make it

1077
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,711
Me, I got a plug Special
Ed, "I Got It Made"

1078
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,964
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron
I'm payin' Dwyane Wade

I'm from the
Empire State That's--

1084
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,354
- In New York - Hey
