1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,336
Mike Prince

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,255
is Axe's real enemy.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,424
I want to officially
welcome each of you to...

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,009
Taylor Mason Carbon!

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,969
-[cheering]
-Whoo! Nice. All right!

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,304
You know my new artist,
Tanner? He's not workin'.

7
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,764
You know what,
let me talk to him.

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,439
This happened to be
a Nico Tanner original?

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,401
[groans]

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,986
The doctors are
running some tests,

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,696
but they think he'll
need a kidney transplant.

12
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,823
My father wasn't
healthy enough to pass

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,742
the workup to get
on the donor list.

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,326
I have a guy.

15
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,203
They need you to rip
a letter on my behalf

16
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,913
out of the SEC
and grease the skids

17
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,540
-to a charter.
-Sure.

18
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,084
Welcome to the NYAG.

19
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,003
Today,
you're gonna go after a cabinet member.

20
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,964
Secretary of the Treasury,
Todd Krakow.

21
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,425
We have a problem
with the assignment.

22
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,220
I'm not part of a
criminal enterprise...

23
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,972
He's out. Fired by
the White House.

24
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,891
[whispering] Back
to square fuckin' one!

25
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:02,562
Is this a reward or
to teach me a lesson?

26
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,397
Both.

27
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,316
We need a rockstar in our corner,
too.

28
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,567
Mike Prince.

29
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,569
Go to him. Enlist him. Team up.

30
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,030
Get me anyone who
can help us find out

31
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,241
what is near and dear to
Michael Thomas Aquinas Prince.

32
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,744
Because when I find
out what matters to him,

33
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,455
I am going to
fuckin' destroy it.

34
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,541
And him right along with it.

35

36
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,647
[Royal music playing]

37
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,616
[sighs]

38
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,618
[speaking in Danish]

39
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,216
[sighs]

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,094
Ah.

41
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,596
You're putting on
this little show here

42
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,723
instead of at home
and instead of managing

43
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,809
our underperforming employees.

44
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,811
That means you got
somethin' to tell me.

45
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,856
You read me like the Sunday papers,
honcho.

46
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,150
I was re-toxing last
night at the Aviary

47
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,277
and learned one
Michael Prince is ready

48
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,529
to be confirmed
Ambassador Extraordinary

49
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,281
and Plenipotentiary to Denmark.

50
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,824
You don't fuckin' say.

51
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,701
I do.

52
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,495
And while I saw the upside in
him posting up in Copenhagen,

53
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,998
I also envisioned
him parachuting back

54
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,001
into our fair city,
the anointed one.

55
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:52,839
So I decided to give him
a smorgasbord of shit.

56
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,341
I spent the last 18
hours in a whirlwind

57
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,677
of Mike Prince research-wining,
dining,

58
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,429
drugging, grooming,

59
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,847
levering, horse-trading...

60
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,182
And the dividend?

61
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,600
Prince keeps himself locked down

62
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,602
Fort Knox-style. But
one Roger Dunbar,

63
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,188
known to you as Scooter,
is our way in.

64
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,814
The man likes to play
the angles at football

65
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,691
and basketball and horse racing.

66
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,359
Scooter's a sports bettor?

67
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,487
On a staggering scale
through numerous fronts.

68
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,156
He's trying to disguise it,

69
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,284
but no way he can afford
the inevitable swings.

70
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,287
He's leaking like a
raft at a kid's pool party.

71
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,956
And his leaks
are Prince's leaks.

72
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,292
The sort of vulnerability
that stops you

73
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,169
from getting government
security clearance.

74
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,713
And for good reason.

75
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,840
Nail him to the pyre,
douse him with oil,

76
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,217
and light his ass up.

77
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,553
Yes. Joan of Arc style.

78
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,055
But first, a quick nap.

79
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,516
[sighs]

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,025
Watch yourself with them
when you go in there later.

81
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,109
You make it sound
like I'm going into

82
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,653
the lion enclosure at the zoo.

83
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,946
[chuckles]

84
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,489
Axe Cap's been called worse.

85
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,199
Yeah.

86
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,700
Or are you just afraid
I'm gonna say something

87
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,160
to make you look bad?

88
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,580
-Fuck no. The opposite.
-[chuckles]

89
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,998
Just... if you're
not used to it,

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,541
the money talk
from my colleagues

91
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,753
can be relentless,
shameless, suffocating.

92
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,421
Ah. You know,

93
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,258
only rich people get
embarrassed by money talk.

94
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,260
The rest of us get embarrassed
because we don't have any money.

95
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,221
My job is to train them
to tune every fiber of

96
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,931
their being to get
as much as they can.

97
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,058
But I've seen the
negative effect it can have.

98
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,935
It can restrict
growth in other ways.

99
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,104
Well, you can say that,
'cause you're one of 'em.

100
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,939
You're rich.

101
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,192
How much you make?

102
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,613
-Really?
-Yeah.

103
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,657
It'll clarify things.

104
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,575
My bonus was $9
million last year.

105
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,162
Jesus.

106
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,123
Look,
I get that some of this is new to you.

107
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,291
And...

108
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,458
you can be who you want to be.

109
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,502
But y-you just seem...

110
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,212
[inhales]

111
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,172
I don't know,
overly interested in what those buyers

112
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,924
like Lisa had to
say the other night.

113
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,885
But when we met,
you acted like money is like chains.

114
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,848
So I guess I'm just saying,
beware.

115
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,767
Yeah, I hear you.

116
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,312
It's just that now that
I have a little bit of it,

117
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,938
that money, I...

118
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,898
it's startin' to
feel like freedom.

119
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,111
Karl!

120
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,487
You rang?

121
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,993
You look ready to toss your
cap into the air at West Point.

122
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,162
Don't make a
whole thing out of it.

123
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,497
Pull the record of every
prisoner I've put away.

124
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,000
-Here and at SDNY.
-Criminal records?

125
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,085
Uh, no, medical records.

126
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,670
I'm lookin' for a kidney.

127
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,672
Pristine quality.
[clicks tongue] Primo.

128
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,507
Ah,
Chuck. Shoppin' for the old man.

129
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,925
I get it.

130
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,427
I used to walk six
miles to the army PX

131
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,554
to get my dad a pack of Lucky's.

132
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,723
-How's he doin'?
-Hm.

133
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,850
Like Clint Eastwood.
Straight-backed but uh--

134
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,144
But sometimes,
he just gets that lost look in the eyes

135
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,812
and starts talking
to the furniture?

136
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,481
In a sense.

137
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,524
Rough for him. Rougher for you.

138
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,734
Hmm.

139
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,110
Gets the old compassion flowing.

140
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,362
I'll grab what I can.

141
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,366
Gotta tell ya,
it works. You look great.

142
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,409
-Don't make a whole--
-Copy!

143
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,792
I heard you fell back
to the country place.

144
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,002
Yeah, trying to figure
out how much to sell it for.

145
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,837
Lara always liked it. Me?

146
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,215
I can't stand the
quiet. You interested?

147
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,217
Nah, too rich for my blood.

148
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,552
But you're still interested
in a bank charter, right?

149
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,388
-You know I am.
-Well...

150
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,515
There may be a way
around our obstacle.

151
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,558
When we heard that Rhoades
was teaching up at the law school,

152
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,727
I tapped some Yale
connects I know from boating.

153
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,731
And it turns out he was using
a bunch of the law school kids

154
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,650
as a think tank to
take out Krakow.

155
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,236
Motherfucker.

156
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,446
So I ran my own think tank.

157
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,415
Feels like time for a recount.

158
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,958
Do it.

159
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,918
Find a true believer
amongst those acolytes

160
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,838
and let's get Rhoades
caught in a crossfire hurricane.

161
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,923
And find me another
charter. Get Victor on it.

162
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,935
Designing for the space?

163
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,645
Making sure it's lit properly.

164
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,440
Right. Like Von Sydow,
not Dusty.

165
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,442
[imitating] "I don't sell
my work by the yard."

166
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,777
I get it. I studied art history.

167
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,780
And yet you work here.

168
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,282
Well, in a way, so do you.

169
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,409
Who fuck are you?

170
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,411
The name's Mafee.

171
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,288
I don't think I'll
remember that.

172
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,460
Do you own any art?

173
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,128
I have a hand-painted
production cell

174
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,881
from the movie   Tron
with the young Bridges.

175
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,466
-Not--
-Obviously.

176
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,217
I meant as an investment.

177
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,760
Oh,
not yet. But I'll start acquiring

178
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,305
in the next 12 to 18 months.

179
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,141
-What do you like?
-No fuckin' idea.

180
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,602
I don't know anything about
the underlying commodity.

181
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,853
Don't need to.

182
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,646
Just that it can go up in value.

183
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,024
It's speculation,
with an option for manipulation.

184
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,449
What'll you give me for that?

185
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,923
You were worried about me,
and I beat 'em.

186
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,425
That group of
overpaid philistines

187
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,677
just gave me $3,200.
for a signed doodle.

188
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,804
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

189
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,349
Hm.

190
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,895
[indistinct chatter]

191
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,358
It's great that you
guys are doing this.

192
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,692
So many so-called
impact investors,

193
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,319
they don't really care.

194
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,987
We're money where your
mouth is type of people.

195
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,864
[presenter]   And now,
please welcome our host

196
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,866
for the evening, Mike Novogratz.

197
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,494
[audience cheering]

198
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,954
[Novogratz] I want
to thank all of you

199
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,622
for supporting us tonight.

200
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,624
The mission of the Bail Project

201
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,126
is to combat racial and
economic disparities

202
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,545
within our broken
criminal justice system...

203
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,796
-[Rian] Mock tuna wrap?
-No, thanks.

204
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:10,007
Maybe. Whoa.

205
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,225
Take the pretend
tuna. And a napkin.

206
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,894
-So you...
-Yes.

207
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,772
I... have to go
grind some daiquiris.

208
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,233
Wait, it's not daiquiri season.
And you don't grind them.

209
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,986
I don't know why I said
that. I gotta go. [chuckles]

210
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,737
[Novogratz] ...if you
want to dig deeper,

211
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,115
you can pay in
Bitcoin or dollars.

212
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,992
And I'm giving you
a good reason to.

213
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,201
It's my great pleasure
to introduce to you

214
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,328
a friend of the Bail Project,

215
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,372
an American hero...

216
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,083
my friend, Mr. Jason Isbell.

217
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,085
[audience cheering]

218
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,926
Thank you all.

219
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,430
If you ever spent
even one night in jail,

220
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:01,392
then you understand just
how precious your freedom is.

221
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,686
And if you're a human
being with your eyes open,

222
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,730
you realize that

223
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,774
freedom isn't exactly equally
available for everybody.

224
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,110
So I'm happy to be here
with you this evening.

225
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,778
[Isbell strums guitar]

226
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,169
I couldn't be happy
in the city at night

227
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,130
You can't see the
stars for the neon lights

228
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,091
The sidewalk's dirty
and the river's worse

229
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,178
The underground
trains all run in reverse

230
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,306
Nobody here can dance like me

231
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,267
Everybody's clapping
on the one and the three

232
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,645
Am I

233
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,938
The last of my kind?

234
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,484
Am I

235
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,195
The last of my kind?

236
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,574
So many people
with so much to do

237
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,161
The winter's so cold
your hands turn blue

238
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,664
Old men sleeping
on the filthy ground

239
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,667
They spend their whole
day just walking around

240
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,836
And nobody else
here seems to care

241
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,839
They walk right past them
like they ain't even there

242
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,092
Am I

243
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,678
- The last of my kind?
-[cell phone chimes]

244
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,066
Oh, shit!

245
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,442
[scoffs]

246
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,536
[scoffs]

247
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,584
This isn't great.

248
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:55,464
A picture of you burning
a bathtub full of ballots?

249
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,174
No.

250
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,051
Back in college,
junior year. [sighs]

251
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,720
You rigged the election?

252
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,388
You really wanted to
be president of the YCC.

253
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,223
More than that.

254
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,308
Look closely and you'll see
the name of my opponent,

255
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,561
Robertson Wycoff.

256
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,647
Oh my God,
this guy was straight out of the

257
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,692
Niedermeyer from   Animal House
school of student government.

258
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,068
Ah,
I'm starting to remember you telling me

259
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,570
about this in law school.

260
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,904
He was like a fascist back then,
right?

261
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,406
I remember the times,

262
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,576
we were pro-divestment,
anti-apartheid.

263
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,578
He leaned more status quo,

264
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,289
said South Africa
wasn't our problem.

265
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,291
You couldn't risk
letting him win.

266
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,585
No, indeed.

267
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,755
So some friends of mine did
the Saybrook College vote tally,

268
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:40,217
which meant we could
suppress my opponent's turnout.

269
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,094
Retroactively.

270
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,138
You stole a student election
and posed for pictures.

271
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,765
[scoffs]

272
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,767
Our own little homage
to "Landslide Lyndon."

273
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,602
People find out you
turned your dorm room

274
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,896
into Tammany Hall,
that's a potential career killer.

275
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,107
And I have been sent this memento mori,
anonymously,

276
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,734
with the gracious
opportunity to resign

277
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,652
my teaching post at Yale.

278
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,862
It's extortion. You can't.

279
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,530
I don't plan to.

280
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,199
You have any idea who sent it?

281
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,784
I do.

282
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,077
A recalcitrant former pupil.

283
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,204
[scoffs]

284
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,289
And much like a disobedient dog,

285
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,626
I will bring him to heel.

286
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,922
I forget that when
you have a boss,

287
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,715
they can summon you.

288
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,467
Or is that more of a king thing?

289
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,470
Both? Anyway,
here I am, summoned.

290
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,554
Close the door.

291
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,312
I want to talk about last
night. If you ran into me,

292
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,939
you can run into people
we do business with.

293
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,315
People who will
wonder about you,

294
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,691
about what kind of
place I'm running,

295
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,859
why I don't pay
enough for my people

296
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,945
not to work second jobs.

297
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,363
I can wear a wig.

298
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,697
I have no desire to
make you uncomfortable

299
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,533
or to job shame you.

300
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,992
What's with the gig?

301
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,661
It's a gig economy.

302
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,120
For some people.

303
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,373
Not mid-six-figure
pre-bonus analysts.

304
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,375
My roommates and I have been
doing the   Party Down   thing

305
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,877
together ever since
we got to the city.

306
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,546
So you don't want
to leave them behind.

307
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,339
There are less laborious
ways to keep in touch.

308
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,550
A WhatsApp group,
the occasional escape room.

309
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,593
Uh... hmm.

310
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,512
I get the distinction now.

311
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,597
You're my boss, but not a king.

312
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,641
You don't own my time.

313
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,685
We have a work relationship.

314
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,020
Let's keep it that way. Cool?

315
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,689
Kewl.

316
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,024
That time I said it with
the K and W spelling.

317
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,860
Could you hear it? [chuckles]

318
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,820
Thanks for your concern.

319
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,405
Now back to work we go.

320
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,493
Oh, leave it open, closed?

321
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,744
I'm feeling closed.

322
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,383
You take steps yet?

323
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,010
Uh... percolating.

324
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,386
I'll get to it.

325
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,597
What's up? You seem phlegmatic.

326
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,432
-Even for--
-No, no, I'm fine.

327
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,559
I'm just in attack mode,
and, uh--

328
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,728
Come on,
Mamoun's is the cleanest falafel

329
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,814
outside of the Holy Land. You
haven't even touched yours.

330
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,608
[muttering]

331
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,777
The thing with the
woman I was seeing--

332
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,195
[sighs]
--that's over.

333
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,573
Oh... she was a keeper,
you said.

334
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,075
Yeah, that's what most guys
would call someone that smart,

335
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,953
beautiful, kind,
and willing to throw them a threesome.

336
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,581
Wowza.

337
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,374
-You'd think.
-You didn't like it?

338
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,251
No. I liked it.

339
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,753
Of course I liked it.

340
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,087
[chuckles]

341
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,422
Give me pistachio ice cream,

342
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,757
I'll eat it and smile,

343
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,259
as Diamond David
Lee Roth would say.

344
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,054
But, yeah, it was uncomfortable.

345
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,764
It's just too many limbs.

346
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,599
-[laughs]
-Too many questions.

347
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,392
[chuckling] Oh, what to do.

348
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,852
Yeah.

349
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,729
Give me rum raisin,
on the other hand,

350
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,066
I'll inhale the whole pint
and root around the fridge

351
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,943
to find another one.

352
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,945
And that's what I was missing.

353
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,113
Well, Cat seems pretty,
you know, liberated.

354
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,157
Have you broached the
subject of what you really want?

355
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,284
A-as you said,
she's smart and sensitive.

356
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,994
And she saw-- [stammering]

357
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,496
She saw that it
would never work,

358
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,872
not all the way from me.

359
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,208
Not without,
you know... [clicks tongue]

360
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,834
And so she said
something along the lines of,

361
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,461
"We'll always have Paris."

362
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,714
Only the words she used were harsher,
you know?

363
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,132
And all about wasting her time.

364
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,759
-[sighs]
-Shit.

365
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,761
And now I got some
goddamn college kid

366
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,346
wasting my fucking time.

367
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,931
Well,
whatever you're feeling about

368
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,558
what she did to you, do to him.

369
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,143
And I'll help.

370
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,019
You want half my
turkey and chopped liver?

371
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,437
Underrated sandwich.

372
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,355
Bet I can name two better ones.

373
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,358
And I just know you want in
on the other side of that action.

374
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,153
-Why would I?
-'Cause, like Michael Cheritto,

375
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,322
for you,
the action is the juice.

376
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,615
Don't know him.

377
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,159
You should see   Heat.

378
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,036
On my list.

379
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,746
But I get that you're
saying you think

380
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,789
-I'm a gambling man.
-I don't think it.

381
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,458
I observed it.

382
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,043
Those guys are just
scattered to the wind.

383
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,210
They're your runners,
placing your bets

384
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,046
so they don't track back to you.

385
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,131
But I tracked it back.

386
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,884
Look,
those guys are a street marketing team.

387
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,677
I'm building out a brand
on a new company.

388
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,471
Bullshit.

389
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,849
This hobby of yours makes
you vulnerable to extortion.

390
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,351
And that extortion has come.

391
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,229
Prince finds out about this,
he shitcans you,

392
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,981
then you're an orphan
without a purpose.

393
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,151
I thought I was so GD careful.

394
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,070
None of that matters now.

395
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,571
Give up Prince.

396
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,199
Nothin' to give.

397
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,242
He may be the best at bleaching.

398
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,411
But no one gets
to 11 figures clean.

399
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,247
Go home.

400
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,083
Remember the thing.

401
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,126
Come tell Axe and me.

402
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,961
And your life stays the same.

403
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,256
Don't,
and you lose everything you hold sacred.

404
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,278
Glad you accepted
my offer to drop by.

405
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,614
I didn't like the
circumstances you left under.

406
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,119
Never bad to march with
your conscience intact.

407
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,746
Not sure I agree with that.

408
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,959
Conscience can be a little
bit like those old nonstick pans.

409
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,044
Flakes off under heat.

410
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,131
Produces noxious fumes
that ruin the whole enterprise.

411
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,091
Now,
what you're really looking for

412
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,301
is a cast iron soul.

413
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,637
Durable, seasoned.

414
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,765
If I wanted advice
about pots and pans,

415
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,767
I'd have signed up
to intern for Guy Fieri.

416
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,853
[chuckles]

417
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,939
Well then,
here's the advice you really came for.

418
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,732
Sign your name

419
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,776
to everything you write.

420
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,111
I don't know what
you're talking about.

421
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,739
You do. And you should own it.

422
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,366
C'mon,
do what your Chef Fieri does.

423
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,743
Use your leverage.
Don't throw it away.

424
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,954
Hell,
he started out with a '67 Camaro,

425
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,498
bleached goatee,
and a hankering for Sloppy Joe,

426
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,000
and he ended up with an empire.

427
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,710
Morality isn't leverage.

428
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,920
Democracy isn't
leverage. Decency--

429
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,464
It was a student election.

430
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,885
To decide who got to woo
Oingo Boingo to Spring Fling

431
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,095
and push them
not to play Sun City.

432
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,140
It wasn't   Il Duce   in '34.

433
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,266
There's a difference.

434
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,517
Not as much as you think.

435
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,686
One leads to the other.

436
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,105
Oh, fuck.

437
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,691
I can tell how good
that felt to you to say.

438
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,360
Problem is, it's just not true.

439
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,491
You're right about one thing.

440
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,119
Sending an anonymous
email was weak.

441
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,538
I answer for that now.

442
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,541
Just like you will have to
answer for your mistake.

443
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,542
[scoffs]

444
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,504
Huh.

445
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,007
See,
this is where old days I'd have appealed

446
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,259
to your fear and greed centers.

447
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,388
Dangled an unattainable
post-graduation job

448
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,432
in front of you,
or the specter of some

449
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,684
member of your family
getting into legal trouble.

450
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,770
Instead,

451
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,190
allow me to share with you
a lesson from my own life.

452
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,858
So it's guilt then,
I'm guessin'.

453
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,360
Listen, Merle.

454
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,903
I don't know you,

455
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,613
or what you do or
plan to do with your life.

456
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,949
But I know this.

457
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,409
If you move me out
by using blackmail,

458
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,745
you will be setting
yourself up for a life...

459
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,748
[chuckles]

460
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,583
well, a life quite like mine.

461
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,087
One open to moments of

462
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,256
deep regret and loss of face.

463
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,924
Ah, the stern warning.

464
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,676
The wisdom from down the road.

465
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,095
I'm giving you the most
valuable thing I have:

466
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,847
perspective.

467
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,558
You have the chance
to live a life of honor.

468
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,269
To sleep through the night--

469
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,354
You know what? I
already have a father

470
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,065
who sells me his bad choices,
his object lessons.

471
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,236
You have a day
to resign gracefully.

472
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,322
After that,
I'm blasting the picture out wide.

473
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,413
[door closes]

474
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,626
I may have a vote-rigging
problem on my horizon.

475
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,795
I assume you're not teeing up a big,
juicy case.

476
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,463
Oh, in this scenario,

477
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,173
I'm the golf ball.
Take a look at this.

478
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,426
Hmm...

479
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,095
Nice lighter. ST. Dupont?

480
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,597
Let's talk about those
ballots I'm taking the lighter to.

481
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,099
Hmm.

482
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,018
Does the election-tampering
bother you?

483
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,395
Nah, I'd have a bigger problem
if you weren't in it to win it.

484
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,981
I was on the right side of history,
if that matters.

485
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,483
Yeah, no, not much.

486
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,235
[inhales]

487
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,945
Look,
you were practically a kid.

488
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,488
I am guessing you
had your reasons

489
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,990
or were just
practicing your moves.

490
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,617
But now as a state
constitutional officer,

491
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,329
your voters may feel
differently about this if it gets out.

492
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,080
That's why I'm here.

493
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,999
You want me to tee up a big,
juicy case,

494
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,251
one that screams out
justice and fairness,

495
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,337
and bumps your tee time
right off the front page.

496
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,130
I do. Yes.

497
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,257
As you'd say... "Let me work."

498
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,556
I will need you to sign a
contract that states clearly

499
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,850
you're exclusively working
here and nowhere else.

500
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,018
And if I won't sign?

501
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,686
I think maybe then you're gone.

502
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,229
I can't have people here
who are less committed

503
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,731
than contestants
on   The Bachelor.

504
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,358
There is no way you've even seen

505
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,734
one episode of   The
Bachelor. How can you--

506
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,152
Sometimes it
helps me fall asleep.

507
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,362
Their insipid self-confidence

508
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,905
and beauty is a somnolent.

509
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,698
But the point is,
if you work with me,

510
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,367
I need your blood,
because that is what I give.

511
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,243
I don't know.

512
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,579
I want you here. You
think clearly. That's rare.

513
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,997
But you can also
communicate clearly.

514
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,707
The combo is more rare.

515
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,542
And then there's
the ability to charm,

516
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,544
get people on your side
without resorting to cheap tricks.

517
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,881
Plus, also,
I can see you struggling to remain

518
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,050
a good person
despite the temptations.

519
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,010
It would seem a
mistake to fire someone

520
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,304
with those characteristics, no?

521
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,680
I don't want to fire you.

522
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,224
You want to own me.

523
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,643
And that's not cool.

524
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,062
You haven't answered me.

525
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,730
Right.

526
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,907
[cell phone chimes]

00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,876
Oh...

528
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,758
Ya likes?

529
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,969
I dug like Indiana
Jones in the Ark picture.

530
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,429
I see that.

531
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,472
These are potent.

532
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,933
And could be
quite helpful to me.

533
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,601
Yeah. I and everyone now

534
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,270
not only understand
why you stole the election,

535
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,188
but we're rooting
for you in retrospect.

536
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,899
You had to take him out.
By any means necessary.

537
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,568
If Yale's student body president

538
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,278
was anti-divestment,

539
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,904
picking the speakers
for every event,

540

stacking the decks
at every meeting.

541
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,408
His own quotes and
speeches say it all.

542
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,784
How did you get these?

543
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,286
That's a question I expect

544
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,954
from my brother-in-law,
the garmento.

545
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,789
The point is, use this stuff.

546
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,416
And then even if that
picture of you is released,

547
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,792
the story will be...

548
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,627
you were fighting
institutionalized racism

549
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,379
and slaying a dragon.

550
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,964
A dragon who currently serves

551
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,049
as the beloved
university chaplain.

552
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,804
I looked him up,
too. A lifetime of service.

553
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,806
So he turned out
to be a good guy

554
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,308
because you saved him.

I did. He's expecting
you tomorrow.

for payment to be negotiated

move out of state

soon as he's released.

I know what you're doing here
and who you hoped to meet,

581

but I'm afraid Aman Dekel
isn't gonna make it today.

Well, less powerful than,

From one perspective,
but from another...

589
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,276
the residents
of this institution

590
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,361
come to me with
their afflictions.

And I give them
better treatment than

593
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,367
And that's why they were happy

00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,328
to come to me
and to lure you in.

They would've gutted her.

00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,995
She'll never let me go.

645
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,580
She will keep the
machines on for years,

646
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,707
hoping for a miracle
while I crap myself

647
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,876
and the money runs out.

648
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,502
And Chuck,
he might pull the plug when

649
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,129
I'm in the middle of a sentence.

650
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,173
He's doing everything
he can to help you.

651
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,341
Sure, he is.

652
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,720
But you, you're the one
with liquid silver in her veins,

653
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,638
the cool-headed killer.

654
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,933
You'll do the right
thing at the right time.

655
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:32,562
At the "right time,"
you'll be comatose,

656
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,314
completely incommunicative,

657
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,899
and you want me to
come in waving this around

658
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,400
in front of your
young wife and son?

659
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,902
It'll be a total shit show.

660
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,195
That's why I'm asking you.

661
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,946
No, I-- I pray,

662
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,115
to the extent that I pray,

663
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,284
that these decisions
never need be made.

664
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,995
But...

665
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,919
if the worst comes to pass,
Wendy...

666
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,463
if I hit the fucking wall

667
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,757
and become a full gomer,

668
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,137
I need you to be clear-eyed
and punch my ticket.

669
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,477
Can I count on you?

670
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,062
[sighs]

671
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,523
Sure, Dad.

672
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,610
If it comes to it,
I'll put you down.

673
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,988
[door opens, closes]

674
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,281
That's a good girl.

675
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,668
[Chuck] I see.

676
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,628
While I've been out
scouring the countryside

677
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,713
trying to save your life,

678
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:44,509
you put your trust
in someone else.

679
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,219
Oh,
I've been doing what needs to be done.

680
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,263
Or are you here to tell me

681
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,224
that you found me a
donor and it isn't necessary?

682
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,517
[exhales]

683
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,104
No.

684
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,189
Unfortunately, it is.

685
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,525
I'll leave you two to
settle your business.

686
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,547
Scooter's on his way up.

687
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,507
Heh. Longest
elevator ride of his life.

688
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,509
I knew he was gonna cave.

689
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,720
Saw it in his eyes that he'd
do anything to save himself.

690
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,179
[elevator bell rings]

691
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,775
You look surprised.
Was I not invited?

692
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,948
I felt, in a way, that I was.

693
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,867
Or at least that my
invitation was implied.

694
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,162
Love this.

695
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:58,833
Raw concrete. Very wabi-sabi.

696
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,002
You have Rande
Gerber decorate for ya?

697
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,254
[sighs]

698
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,006
Threw yourself at
the merciful hem

699
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,758
of the Shogun skirts?

700
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,093
Not exactly. He was
already well aware of the bets.

701
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,720
Because they were his.

702
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,513
Too bad. Ambassador with

703
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,057
a gambling problem's a no-go.

704
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,267
No problem here.

705
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,228
I have a better winning
percentage than the Vegas books.

706
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,606
Plus,
sports betting is now legal in this state.

707
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,733
Those runners you saw
placed the action for me

708
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,610
at the sports books
at upstate casinos.

709
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,111
Because that much money,
with my profile,

710
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,780
would have moved the lines.

711
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,782
Yes. You had your
man put 'em down

712
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,116
to get you a better price.

713
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,785
Protect and serve.

714
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,453
Don't worry, though,
my records are orderly.

715
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,455
We have it all documented
in exquisite detail.

716
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,165
Taxes paid on all the profits.

717
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,750
And the Danes are
a sporting bunch.

718
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,585
They love a good wager.

719
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,132
You made a mistake coming here,
Mike.

720
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,093
I smoked you out.

721
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,011
You could have had me
wasting my time on this

722
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,097
until your post was clinched.

723
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,474
But now I know which
direction I need to go in.

724
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:00,895
Without meaning to,
you guys have just revealed it to me.

725
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,939
You're trying to
put a read on me?

726
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,149
Steady hands,
no micro-expressions,

727
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,943
nothing there.

728
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,153
So you can look as long and
hard as you want at my life,

729
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,989
past or present.

730
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,907
There's nothing there
for you to chew on.

731
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,117
You sure?

732
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,910
When a man's bluffing,

733
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,996
he looks a guy
right in the eyes.

734
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,622
I look people in the eye because

735
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,165
I believe in myself.

736
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,251
And I like to connect with them.

737
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,628
Which is one of the things
I love about the Danes,

738
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,338
their warmth.

739
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,799
They have the most
delightful demeanor

740
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,843
and a wonderful word
to describe their state

741
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,845
of cozy well-being.

742
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,681
Hygge.

743
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,684
It's the contentment of feeling warm,
being warm.

744
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,853
Danes are   hygge-like.

745
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,730
And in the time I will be
spending in their midst,

746
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,190
I plan to embrace
their way of life.

747
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,484
While you will remain here--

748
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,236
Cold, lonely,

749
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,072
self-obsessed,

750
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,575
and most assuredly
not   hygge-like.

751
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,377
Fuck.

752
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,048
I didn't anticipate the carom.

753
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,632
But what did you pick up on him?

754
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,010
Not a goddamn thing.
I was fucking bluffing.

755
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,220
Next time you
bring me something,

756
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,056
make sure it's something.

757
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,016
You'll always be my guy, Wags.

758
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,102
But don't make me have to get
another guy that you report to.

759
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,651
Now, I said something to this kid,
Merle.

760
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,653
About the cost of these actions.

761
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,739
[clears throat]

762
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,408
And although I was merely
trying to influence him...

763
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,870
Fuck, Ira,
I was him at law school.

764
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,748
And if someone,
anyone had tried to warn me off

765
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,917
becoming who I did,
I'd have listened.

766
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,961
I was right there with you,
and I know exactly who you were,

767
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,547
the smartest and most
rigorous student in our class.

768
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,758
The only one who ever doubted you was you,
man.

769
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,927
And y-you wouldn't have listened

770
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,637
to any kind of warning

771
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,014
or bromide from anyone,
especially not some--

772
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,682
Some grizzled old pol?

773
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,559
Yeah, something like that.

774
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:08,147
You know, I always figured
I'd keep growing in a real way.

775
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,817
That the worst parts of
me would recede over time,

776
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,237
that I'd be able to will
myself forward to the better.

777
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,114
Oh, instead?

778
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,950
As 50 looms, you come to
see that those sub-optimal parts,

779
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,535
the bugs, as it were...

780
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,411
[chuckles] They aren't bugs.

781
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,372
No. Turns out, they are you.

782
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,124
Hmm. Might not be an age thing.

783
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,708
From the moment our
parents look at us a certain way,

784
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,796
it might all be set
in fucking stone.

785
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,132
You gotta deploy the
materials I gave you.

786
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,635
Nope.

787
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,097
I'm shredding these printouts.

788
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,391
And I need you to destroy
the original package

789
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,976
you put together.

790
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,769
[sighs] I won't.

791
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,354
And neither will you.

792
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,982
I'm glad to know
that you've changed.

793
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,692
In your heart.

794
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,610
But just... what if you
didn't tell your heart

795
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,155
what you were doing yet and
first you got out of this jam?

796
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,990
This kid is coming for you.

797
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:02,827
If he had a pistol,
would you let him shoot you?

798
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,620
No, you'd defend yourself

799
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,998
and then go about making amends.

800
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,208
Once you knew you
were still breathing.

801
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,836
Do the same here.

802
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,673
I know you better
than you know yourself.

803
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,593
And I know what you need.

804
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,178
So...

805
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,346
you take that and do
the thing you have to.

806
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,851
[sighs]

807
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,193
Yes?

808
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,155
What's he doing here?

809
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,365
He's part of it.

810
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,783
Part of?

811
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,743
Such a thing.

812
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,038
What is?

813
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,207
[exhales] A violation
of this scope,

814
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,167
given your history?

815
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,878
And to think I wouldn't have a
system in place to monitor you,

816
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,588
given said history.

817
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,298
[whispering] That's
downright insulting.

818
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,301
[clicks tongue] Such a thing.

819
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,011
All right. That's
quite enough of that.

820
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,971
Though, incredibly, he is right.

821
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,224
Why are you running
a search through

822
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,226
the employees' medical records?

823
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,272
Go.

824
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,316
Traditionally,
the scent hound gets

825
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,361
to tear at the
quarry at hunt's end.

826
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,696
Out.

827
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,407
It's nothing personal.
Just business.

828
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,243
I always liked you.

829
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,584
It's Chuck's father.

830
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,920
He's gonna die unless
he gets a kidney.

831
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,588
          -So I thought I--
    -You should have come to me.

832
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,090
Would you have let
me run the search?

833
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,759
No. But I'd have
saved you from that.

834
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,261
We haven't been
able to save each other

835
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,762
from much lately.

836
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,223
Since you're here,

837
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,267
let me try.

838
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,851
Mike Prince.

839
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,270
Let it go.

840
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,896
I sat with him, with Taylor.

841
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,273
He's not out to hurt you.

842
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,441
If he wasn't before, he is now.

843
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,068
Because he knows my intentions.

844
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,362
Let it go anyway. In the past,

845
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,364
when I have nudged, counseled,

846
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,574
warned you to lay off
against other opponents,

847
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,410
it's because you
were beating yourself.

848
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,161
Being rash, lacking focus,

849
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,871
becoming consumed
by your own rage.

850
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,665
But in this case,
it's something else.

851
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,458
He'll likely beat you.

852
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,751
I beat him in Yonkers.

853
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,211
Did you?

854
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,754
Or did he kinda let
you have that one?

855
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,090
This is a strange fucking pep talk,
Wend.

856
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,633
Because I'm not giving you one.

857
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,593
[scoffs]

858
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,429
Do you know how many
sports movies I've watched

859
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,222
over the last 20
years? All of them.

860
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,433
So believe me,
I know how to do 'em.

861
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:34,437
And I have the right
poll for this moment.

862
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:38,316
You think he's   Tin Cup   McAvoy,
and you're Don Johnson,

863
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,651
and you'll let the quirk in
his character defeat him,

864
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,486
but it might just be
the other way around.

865
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,405
Not gonna keep
putting balls in the drink.

866
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,574
That's what Roy thought, too.

867
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,492
But once guys like
you and him commit,

868
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,411
you'll keep hitting until
there are no more Pro V-Ones

869
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,996
-left in your golf bag.
-Right.

870
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,622
So what do you
suggest I do instead?

871
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,666
Figure out who or what

872
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,752
from your past
you're still furious at,

873
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,337
because that's where it
always really comes from,

874
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:03,007
and go hit that. Or
finally decide to let it go.

875
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,677
The past.

876
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,845
You're right.

877
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,015
It's always the fucking past.

878
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,019
Wags. In here, please.

879
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,741
Axe Capital!

880
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,534
We've been looking
to hit all of Prince's

881
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,286
current holdings and businesses,
right?

882
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,913
As was ordered. To create a dip

883
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:34,955
in the value of his portfolio

884
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:35,956
before the big feature

885
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,750
on him airs on   The Hour.

886
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,544
Axe figured out we're
aiming at the wrong target.

887
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,213
We were with Prince.
And Prince said,

888
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,131
"You can look as long and
hard as you want in my life,

889
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,883
past and present.

890
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,968
There's nothing there
for you to chew on."

891
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,845
But no one said anything

892
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,555
about his past.

893
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,140
Axe picked up on his tell.

894
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,892
He's got a secret.

895
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,145
Fucking find it.

896
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,982
Hey. You know how
we had feelers out

897
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,234
on a half-dozen of
those shady companies

898
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,027
crying out for public execution?

899
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,987
      -Yeah, Axe filled me in.
     -We're like a fishing boat

900
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,073
with a bunch of
lines over the side.

901
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,241
And we got a tug.

902
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,659
It's called Plaintif-Full.

903
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,244
Good.

904
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,287
Chum the local press.
Wait for another bite,

905
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,664
then set the fucking hook.

906
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,712
[door opens]

907
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,132
Dean Walker is here.

908
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,467
I imagine she is.

909
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,221
[exhales]

910
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,101
Hm.

911
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,311
I had a visit from a young
man named Merle Howard

912
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,772
-a few hours ago.
-I see.

913
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,441
He wanted to throw
himself on the mercy

914
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,443
of the court, so to speak.

915
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,445
He told me of his
plans to blackmail you,

916
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,281
get you ousted,
and how you talked him out of it.

917
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,159
He literally said
he'd misjudged you

918
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,994
and wanted to
report himself to me

919
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,579
for an honor code violation.

920
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,582
I forgave him, of course.

921
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,625
And he asked that I'd
drop the entire matter.

922
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,127
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

923
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,796
So I did some good. Ha!

924
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,466
Well, that is wonderful news.

925
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,968
Yet we live in an age
that doesn't give me

926
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,889
that opportunity to let it go.

927
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,765
If a student knows
something and tells me,

928
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,726
I have no choice
but to investigate it.

929
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,853
That picture of you, Chuck...

930
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,273
what it says about the whole
foundation of your career.

931
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,108
You have to know
there was context.

932
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,487
I was part of a movement

933
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,989
to push the Yale Corporation
to divest holdings--

934
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,992
You stole an election
for social justice?

935
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,828
Divestment itself
was in the balance?

936
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,163
I could make that case.

937
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,664
Against the Robertson
Wycoff I know?

938
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,166
Sounds like a reach.

939
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,959
Here's your
window. Closing fast.

940
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,012
[scoffs]

941
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,899
I guess I thought I
could make a difference

942
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,652
by winning that election.

943
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,820
So you have.

944
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,198
And I'm sure that picture
of you will never come out.

945
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,326
Merle kept it. Said
he was destroying it.

946
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,286
Well,
then is there a way we can consider

947
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,538
this a closed matter?

948
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,456
Not quite.

949
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,458
That's not the only
thing Merle told me.

950
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,419
He also mentioned a student
law clinic you put together.

951
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,547
He'd made his peace
with it. But from where I sit,

952
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,173
it sounds like a
goddamn hit squad.

953
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,716
I see.

954
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,677
Yale Law School
is the nation's finest

955
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,012
because we refuse to
compromise on our principles.

956
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,348
Even if the money came
from outside sources,

957
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,058
even if it was voluntary.

958
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,227
This is against school policy

959
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,687
and non-fucking-negotiable.

960
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,191
Then I step down.
[clicks tongue]

961
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,569
And you redirect
the money funding

962
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,736
the operation
back to my office--

963
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,697
No. We'll keep the bestowal.

964
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,407
And use it for the
good and fair purpose

965
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,908
for which it was
meant to be used.

966
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,077
But I accept your resignation

967
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,620
and I thank you for it.

968
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,083
You did do a good thing.

969
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,501
Two, really.

970
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,336
Merle Howard has
a chance to be a

971
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,213
productive member of society.

972
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,800
And Yale is now protected
from a mentor like you.

973
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:20,514
[door opens, closes]

974
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,433
[sighs]

975
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,607
Rough day?

976
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,150
Not my best.

977
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,278
But I did something.

978
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,824
I actually kept a promise to myself,
a good one.

979
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,827
So that's...

980
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,079
I guess the word is progress.

981
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,332
Hmm. So you feel great?

982
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,334
Oh, let's not get carried away.

983
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,628
Well,
maybe this will take it over the top.

984
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,631
I was researching some big,
juicy cases that would put

985
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,758
a halo over your head
and found a small article

986
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,093
in a local paper about
some neighborhood folks

987
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,471
that got fleeced
by a payday lender.

988
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,056
Company's called Plaintif-Full.

989
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,433
[scoffs] Are they as bad
as their name suggests?

990
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,894
Bad-faith operators. Predatory.

991
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,730
Well, I no longer need it.

992
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,857
But I am in the mood
to take someone down.

993
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,319
[scoffs]

994
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,113
Let's do it because
it's the right thing to do.

995
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,406
Refreshing.

996
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,783
Old school. Move fast on this.

997
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,326
You know it.

998
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,497
[door closes]

999
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,584
I got it.

1000
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,670
When you said the past,

1001
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,963
it jogged my memory of
an old   Fortune   article.

1002
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,632
I used to read
'em on the crapper.

1003
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,842
Is that the actual
one from the crapper?

1004
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,471
No,
I pulled that one out of archives.

1005
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,391
The story is about
Prince's deceased partner,

1006
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,017
David Fells.

1007
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,395
Now Prince sold off 40%
of his company years ago

1008
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,647
to Microsoft,
back when Fells was still alive.

1009
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,732
It was his first big
score. His first billion.

1010
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,194
But he's always famously
refused to sell off the rest.

1011
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,530
To give up control.

1012
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,531
And?

1013
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,032
And...

1014
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,909
this might be a way
for you to wrest control

1015
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,619
of his goddamn
company from within,

1016
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,329
like a Guinea worm.

1017
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,123
Because Fells's
founder's shares come with

1018
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,750
ten to one voting rights.

1019
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,711
You get those,

1020
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,629
you can stage a boardroom coup.

1021
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,506
I've been in touch
with Fells's next of kin,

1022
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,133
his mother.

1023
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,843
She's agreed to meet.

1024
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,805
[smacks lips] And she's
no fan of Mike Prince.

1025
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,890
-How do you know that?
-'Cause she said,

1026
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,893
"I have just what you need
to torpedo Mike Prince."

1027
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,396
She has the founder's shares
and the super voting rights.

1028
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,566
What else could that mean?

1029
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,401
Fuel up your jet?

1030
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,652
You know it.

1031
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,070
Bring her to me.

1032
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,908
[Axe] Mrs. Fells...

1033
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,410
Oh, Brenda.

1034
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,412
Brenda.

1035
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,247
I'm gonna to put this bluntly,
and I'm not

1036
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,083
gonna bother negotiating.

1037
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,253
I will back up an armored
car for your son's shares.

1038
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,714
I-- I'm sorry,
I don't have them.

1039
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,549
Uh-uh...

1040
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,844
he sold them before he died,
to Michael Prince.

1041
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,721
I shouldn't have come.

1042
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,640
Well, ma'am, that is too bad.

1043
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,392
But you knew this
before I flew you in.

1044
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,686
And you didn't say don't, so...

1045
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,856
That leads me to believe
it might be something else.

1046
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,983
Oh,
I'm sure it's something else.

1047
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,779
It's something I've known
and carried for years,

1048
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,697
since my s-all right, look.

1049
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,742
I signed an NDA.

1050
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,787
Prince came to me years ago,
right after David was buried.

1051
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:33,373
He gave me money
and he had me sign.

1052
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,459
This is just you and me talking.

1053
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,797
Whatever you tell me,
and if it's valuable,

1054
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,590
and I use it,

1055
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,927
I will cover any losses
or liabilities you face.

1056
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,970
Only an idiot would
take your word

1057
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,764
and not write this
up with lawyers.

1058
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,724
Only an idiot would
make the offer.

1059
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,852
[scoffs]

1060
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,275
My son was brilliant,

1061
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,319
but he was troubled.

1062
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,863
He had trouble finding
his way through the world.

1063
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,283
He didn't make friends easily.

1064
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,495
And then he started in with
the drinking and the drugs.

1065
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,915
Except for Michael Prince.

1066
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:19,086
Those two spent thousands
of hours in my garage working.

1067
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,630
You know,
Prince was like the forward face

1068
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,592
of all my son's genius.

1069
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,469
And then one day,
he stops by with

1070
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:32,099
what seemed like a windfall,
$200,000.

1071
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,434
He said he'd gotten
a licensing agreement

1072
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,520
and that he would buy
David's piece of the company

1073
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,856
to take the pressure off.

1074
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,691
So David could chill out,
you know,

1075
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,318
clean up, dry out.

1076
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,530
He said that while the
first one didn't work,

1077
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,365
they would start a new company

1078
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,950
when David was strong again.

1079
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,035
And-and to tip the scales,

1080
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,872
he brought along
the check and tickets

1081
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,708
to Rio for Carnival.

1082
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,335
Michael's gonna join
him on the last day.

1083
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:05,132
So David accepted, he went.

1084
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,175
And then the Microsoft
deal was announced,

1085
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,387
and the numbers were reported,
and Michael Prince had made...

1086
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,389
wh-- uh a hundred times

1087
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,266
what he'd paid David,
a thousand.

1088
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,976
He knew the offer was coming.

1089
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,895
Oh, he knew,
and he stalled it off

1090
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,980
until he could
secure David's piece.

1091
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,566
Made it look like a favor
and put him out in the cold.

1092
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,614
I mean, do you know

1093
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,617
what that does to a 25-year-old?

1094
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,577
To lose out like that?

1095
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,079
I mean,
to be stabbed in the back like that

1096
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,414
by your best friend?

1097
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,170
The drinking and using
went into overdrive.

1098
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,255
He said he was
ready to come home.

1099
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,423
But he didn't.

1100
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,050
He-- he went dark.

1101
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,052
And he wound up
dying a month later

1102
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,095
in a single-car accident.

1103
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,599
Michael Prince

1104
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,101
built his fortune
on my son's grave.

1105
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,130
[exhales]

1106
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,133
I was supposed to--

1107
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,720
by now I was supposed
to be done with my PhD

1108
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,889
in economic
philosophy at U Chicago.

1109
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,725
I'd have published
my dissertation.

1110
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,144
But then Bobby Axelrod
put a promise of mentorship,

1111
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,605
a meeting of the minds,
a kinship of ideas,

1112
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,317
and a way of seeing the
markets I'd never felt before,

1113
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,153
and so much money in
front of me that I just...

1114
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,405
I never even
called the professor

1115
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,656
I was supposed to go work with.

1116
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,158
I just withdrew
from the program.

1117
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,494
You wish you were at
the place fun goes to die

1118
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,496
instead of making jillions

1119
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,499
solving unsolvable
puzzles every day?

1120
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,834
I never thought I
was the kind of person

1121
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,502
who would be
tempted by all this.

1122
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,005
And then I told myself that anyone,
everyone,

1123
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,007
would lose a piece
of themselves for this.

1124
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,509
It made me able
to justify what I did.

1125
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,553
And then here I was.

1126
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,680
And it was the perfect chance
to conduct an experiment,

1127
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,682
a test case.

1128
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,226
Part of you wants me to
make the escape you couldn't.

1129
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,812
But the other part
wants me to stay.

1130
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,648
To prove to you that no
one can resist the clarion call.

1131
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,650
I'm on the wrong
side of our generation.

1132
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,402
Even just the four
years between when Axe

1133
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,029
put the choice to me, and now...

1134
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,364
No, yeah, you're old. I'm not.

1135
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,534
But I'm not sitting here
like I'm better than you.

1136
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,077
Fuck. [scoffs]

1137
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,246
You chose something
sturdy and real,

1138
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,999
and where, like, you could land.

1139
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,251
I'm still floating.

1140
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,879
That's what I've been thinking
about since we last talked.

1141
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,214
-How I'm caught between.
-Really?

1142
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,300
I don't want to go work in
the Ford plant for 40 years

1143
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,718
like a rivet head.

1144
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,928
But knowing I'm
really in something?

1145
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,388
[sighs]

1146
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,057
Yeah, that seems good.

1147
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,062
I'm gonna ditch the
catering company.

1148
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,564
Good. But I can't let
you just go and do it

1149
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,733
without warning you what
else you need to be ready for.

1150
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,194
What else one gives
up to go on the journey.

1151
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,237
Oh, so what else do you give up?

1152
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,073
Nights, weekends, holidays.

1153
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,657
Your world will become
a series of data sets,

1154
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,159
line items on a P and L.

1155
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,620
Everything broken
down into basis points.

1156
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,038
And your victories
will not be the money,

1157
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,706
the thing that
anybody can measure,

1158
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,708
but the stuff they can't
begin to appreciate.

1159
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,251
Looking beyond
what's quantifiable,

1160
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,796
the subtle refinements,
the elegance of success.

1161
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,593
I'll quit the catering company.

1162
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,929
Then buy it. Turn it
over to my friends.

1163
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,223
Nice gesture. They
won't appreciate it.

1164
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,391
But at least you'll know you
did a good thing for them.

1165
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,560
Your real friends,
few as they may be, will get it.

1166
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,770
And the ones that don't,

1167
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,979
don't have the capacity to be

1168
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,314
the kind of friend you need.

1169
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,692
So instead of friendship,

1170
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,486
you have to use
work to fill the void?

1171
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,987
I guess I do.

1172
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,783
[sighs]

1173
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,223
Thanks for this.

1174
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,641
[Axe] Yeah, he was in town.

1175
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,601
I figured he'd dig the work.

1176
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,645
This is really good work, man.

1177
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,772
[Tanner] Cool.

1178
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,649
I dig yours.

1179
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,818
Hey. You know,
maybe you want to commission one.

1180
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,113
I spend most of my
money on guitars

1181
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,824
-but I'm thinking about it.
-Yeah, good. Good.

1182
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,826
Hey,
you want to come by my place tonight?

1183
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,828
I'm having my team by
for a special viewing party.

1184
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,496
Oh, no, thank you.

1185
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,665
I-I don't ever really
feel comfortable around

1186
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,125
the financial set, right?

1187
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,626
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

1188
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,671
But there-- there
are some upsides.

1189
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,506
Only thing that sounds
worse is hanging out

1190
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,216
with record label executives.

1191
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,509
Especially when
I'm trying to work.

1192
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,178
I just want to do my thing.

1193
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,013
I don't want to be
somebody's trick monkey.

1194
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,601
Anyway,
thanks for showing me this stuff.

1195
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,186
Really good.
Really inspirational.

1196
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,729
Oh, thanks.

1197
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,692
-Hey see you in a bit.
-Yeah.

["It's Good To Be King"

1199
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,161
-Okay.

1200

[laughter]

1201
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,457
Does the paint
get on your stuff?

1202
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,542
Or do you like, add it?

1203
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,586
Tuk,
you shouldn't bother the man.

1204
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,754
He doesn't like small talk.

1205
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,339
What-- what, uh,

1206
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,840
what is it that
you're trying to ask?

1207
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,675
I just dropped 10K
on this Gucci jacket

1208
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,510
to wear out to clubs, but--

1209
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,554
but now I'm thinking
if I splash some paint--

1210
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,889
Oh, Tuk.

1211
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,224
Yeah,
you really shouldn't do that.

1212
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,725
You'll just ruin your jacket,
loser.

1213
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,560
Exactly.

1214
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,229
The artist thing works for
him because he's an artist.

1215

[Dollar Bill] Get your own game,

1216

like buying the girl
the $10,000 jacket.

1217
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,360
Maybe you'll get
some gratitude points.

1218
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,573
Oh, Tuk.

1219
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,035
...of your own little town

1220
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:13,750
Yeah, the world would swing

1221
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,422
Oh, if I

1222
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,840
Were king

1223
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,429
Hi. I heard we had
to watch this thing.

1224
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,265
My friends were going out

1225
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,934
and I didn't know
where else to go really.

1226
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,606
-Do you mind?
-[laptop chatter]

1227
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,776
It's good to be king

1228
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,238
And have your own way

1229
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,241
Get a feeling of peace

1230
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,410
At the end of the day

1231
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,497
Mr. Ambassador,
your   habiliments.

1232
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,420
All right, everyone.

1233
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,338
You are gonna like this.

1234
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,052
He's a self-made billionaire,

1235
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,054
an advocate for the
environment and our future,

1236
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,599
a man who asks the tough
questions about inequality.

1237
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,310
But to paraphrase Balzac,

1238
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,395
behind every great fortune,

1239
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,314
there is great cruelty.

1240
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,149
And in the case of Mr. Prince,

1241
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,109
exploitation and betrayal.

1242
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,652
Over the next part of the hour,

1243
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,821
we will explore a fortune stolen

1244
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,239
and a legacy pilfered.

1245
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,577
It's been hard.

1246
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,496
It's been brutal, really,

1247
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:36,166
to watch the world
celebrate this man

1248
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,004
and know the truth about
what he did to my son,

1249
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:44,174
which is steal from
him and destroy him.

1250
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,976
You best hope you are
not Dollar Bill's mission,

1251
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,062

you down like Tombstone.

And he got hooked.

up a marginal shitbag operation

1268
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:54,035
that after our takedown
has basically zero value?

00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:31,448
Not at all

1282
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:34,200
Then, one fine mornin' she
puts on a New York station

1283
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,077
They know, she don't believe...

1284
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,455
You disappeared. You
weren't answering your phone.

1285
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,956
Don't talk!

1286
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,126
Just saying hi.

1287
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,963
Can I watch?

1288
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,798
You can stay, you can leave,
you can do whatever.

1289
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,051
You wanted pure?

1290
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,970
This is pure as I got!

1291
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,726
Make yourself a
drink if you want.

1292
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,311
You just let me work.

1293
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,372
Jenny said,
when she was just about five years old

1294
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,833
"You know, my parents are
gonna be the death of us all"

1295
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,256
Two TV sets and
two Cadillac cars

1296
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:33,760
Well, you know,
ain't gonna help me at all

1297
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:36,179
No, just your time do

1298
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:39,349
Then, one fine morning she
turns on a New York station

1299
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,101
She doesn't believe
what she hears at all

1300
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,023
Ooh, she started dancin' to that

1301
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,150
Fine, fine music

1302
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,195
You know,
her life was saved by rock'n'roll

1302
00:58:53,305 --> 00:59:53,447
