1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:03,837
Previously
on Billions.

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:06,297
Michael Prince Capital
is not off to a banner start.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,549
I work for a legend.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,468
- I'm out.
- Team up?

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,636
Done.

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,805
We need to be clean.
Beyond reproach.

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,933
I find myself
unwilling to help you.

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,643
He seems to be after
more than profits here.

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,854
I am hereby creating
The Prince List,

10
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,523
shedding all the dirty
capital currently invested.

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,025
Bud Lazzara. He's the key.

12
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,484
We're not paying.

13
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,986
Big retailer's
been playing dirty.

14
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,487
Rask Sportswear.

15
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,197
And we're gonna
short the snot out of it.

16
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,490
There's a problem
with the short.

17
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,867
You created this problem,
fix it.

18
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,702
His wife came by yesterday.

19
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,537
It's no coincidence that you
got involved with my sponsor.

20
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,539
Are you trying to buy back
the relationship you want?

21
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,041
I haven't given up.

22
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,500
I know you bribed Mr. Santulli,

23
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,836
the head of the Door
& Custodial Union.

24
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,212
Rask is tanking.

25
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,006
Killed the buyout
and fed it to the dogs.

26
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,340
You saw the
news about the Games?

27
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,717
They're pulling them.

28
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,052
Prince isn't just
playing the markets.

29
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,219
His chessboard is much bigger,

30
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,220
and I don't think he's done

31
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,555
making his moves yet.

32
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,640
The very first New
York Olympics.

33
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,225
Every time New York has fallen--

34
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,227
It has been lifted
up and rebuilt

35
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,479
by a great man.

36
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,980
And that's you this time.

37
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,274
And he won't stop till
he gets what he wants.

38

39
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,092
Well, I've got to run

40
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,928
To keep from hidin'

41
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,598
And I'm bound...

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,267
I just achieved slow-wave sleep,

43
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,269
which you know I struggle with.

44
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,231
- Why am I--
- We've got a problem.

45
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,108
Better be a real, bigtime--

46
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,068
Trust me. It is. It's
why I called you in.

47
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,402
The issue is--

48
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,445
You didn't call me in.

49
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,780
Of course, there's no need.

50
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,573
That's why I have
an alert set up.

51
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,075
If there's
middle-of-the-night swipe-ins,

52
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,369
it's either because people
are quitting en masse

53
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,745
and stealing drives,

54
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,039
or there's a margin
call-level problem.

55
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,374
Which is it?

56
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,543
It's... more of the latter.

57
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,670
Well,
you have a captive audience.

58
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,714
I, uh...

59
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,634
met up with Mafee tonight. Drinks,
you know?

60
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,969
We stayed friends,
I hope that's not any kind--

61
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,387
- Speak.
- Right, well...

62
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,764
he kinda spilled some major tea.

63
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,266
"Tea" is gossip.

64
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,309
Yeah. About what?

65
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,020
About the Olympics.

66
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,608
We are rolling, Wyatt.

67
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,819
I'm not on Molly
right now. Or ever.

68
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,446
Tombstone?

69
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,782
Never mind. We got
something huge in the works.

70
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,784
Real estate-focused SPAC.

71
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,661
Offering's coming out this
week. You should invest.

72
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,955
- I should?
- It's our ticket, man.

73
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,332
They call these things
"blank check companies."

74
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,168
Whale-sized
investors launch them

75
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,836
to raise IPO-level money

76
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,629
they can plow into whatever
the hell they want to,

77
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,339
totally unbridled.

78
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,134
In this case,
holding company for prime city real estate.

79
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,552
I'm familiar with SPACs.

80
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,637
- They're all over the Street.
- Right.

81
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,931
Anyway,
it's a partnership with a big--

82
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:06,477
Well, a really big and
also really not-so-big guy.

83
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,646
You sound enthusiastic.

84
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,190
We blew through
our risk management,

85
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,191
doubled down on this thing.

86
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,775
You're a brand-new firm,

87
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,776
and you're risking it all
on sponsoring a SPAC?

88
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,695
No worries. It's an STD.

89
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,655
- Uh, what? Gross.
- A sure thing, dude.

90
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,449
- Oh.
- And beyond that,

91
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,035
it's a gold medal situation.

92
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,704
Buying up
land for the Olympics.

93
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,873
Another player's
making my move. Who?

94
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,626
He didn't say. Thus,
this meeting.

95
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,628
Now I get why you woke me up.

96
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,172
All right, if anyone needs to go home,
shower up,

97
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,217
put on your daytime Garanimals,
go ahead and get back here.

98
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,219
I can send one of
the drivers if anyone needs it.

99
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,346
- Do it. Also--
- I'll send the other driver

100
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,181
to Veselka, then Chinatown.

101
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,227
Anyone want anything else,
let me know, we'll deal with it.

102
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,354
Okay, folks,
Kristy's organizing the midnight snacks

103
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,897
and strong coffee.

104
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,565
- Let's get into it.

105
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,283
Sacker,
I want your best ideas--

106
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,826
press, political, financial,

107
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,703
hell, I'll even take spiritual--

108
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,622
on how we'll fell the
highest net worth individual--

109
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,998
Son.

110
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,834
I thought there'd be
some perfectly legal

111
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,170
fringe benefits to you being AG,

112
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,340
but I find myself a
squirrel who can't get a nut.

113
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,758
Dad, you can't just--

114
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,927
Oh,
I told your girl I was expected.

115
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,679
And asked could she
get me a tomato juice

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,264
from the diner
around the corner.

117
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,682
Told her I'd protect the door.

118
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,101
And I did. From the inside.

119
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,852
Anyway.

120
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,688
I was getting my
paperwork in order

121
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,357
to make an offer
to buy your land,

122
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,360
and then you let someone
skip in line ahead of me?

123
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,362
- My land?
- The NYAG's Office

124
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,865
monitors the disbursement
of certain land for proper use,

125
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,826
does it not?!

126
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,287
Ah, family.

127
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,080
Love to see it.

128
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,415
Love to leave it behind.

129
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,458
Jesus Christ, Dad.

130
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,960
We can do this at your house,
later.

131
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,170
- Or never. Never works, too.
- Not for me.

132
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,589
I was going to throw up
one of those 80/20 jobs

133
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,174
with the "poor door."

134
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,718
Luxury condo building

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,178
with the separate
entrance for the unwashed.

136
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,056
Subsidized housing units
to trigger the tax breaks.

137
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,266
A real man of the people.

138
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,268
But someone is buying it all up.

139
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,228
As is the normal course of--

140
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,024
No, this is about as normal as
a Gaylord Perry Mystery Pitch.

141
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,068
Just loaded up
with viscous slime.

142
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,236
Aha.

143
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,821
Who bought the land, Dad?

144
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,990
Looks like several
buyers. All shell corps.

145
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,908
Terms have been set. They have
30 days to close with the cash.

146
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,411
Anything unusual
with the approvals?

147
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,165
No. Except there hasn't been
much activity until recently.

148
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,335
You don't need this development,
Dad.

149
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,628
And even if you did,
I wouldn't lift a finger to help.

150
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,921
Not 'cause I don't love you.

151
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,340
Because it would be wrong.

152
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,008
In the past, you didn't really--

153
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,885
Ah. I can't change any of that.

154
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,806
Well,
I was a straight shooter about my plans.

155
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,434
Being shameless does not
change a Haman into a Mordechai.

156
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,186
Bye, Dad.

157
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,984
I can't believe that I'm raising this,
but,

158
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,820
we forget who brought us
this information and we use it.

159
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,821
Yeah.

160
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,239
If a big player or corporation

161
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,491
is going through the land bank

162
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,242
to make big purchases
on the downlow.

163
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,995
Yes. That's absolutely
against the spirit of the thing.

164
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,747
And likely means
some other high-baller

165
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,290
is looking to make the
same move as my father.

166
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,250
- You want me to--
- Yeah.

167
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,294
We need to find out who's
trying to buy up all this land,

168
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,545
and why.

169
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,285
We're gathering.

170
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,713
I know how we're going to
smoke out this mystery bidder.

171
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,175
Put a piece of land up for sale.
The piece bordering Stuy Town.

172
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,386
I thought you were
trying to buy more land--

173
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,472
He is. Whoever's backing
Mafee and Dollar Bill will bite at it.

174
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,474
Yes. It'll come anonymously,
through a shell corp.

175
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,976
Which we'll reject.

176
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,352
But we'll get enough
details to figure out

177
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,396
who's spearheading the SPAC.

178
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,356
And once it IPOs,
we can bend this thing over,

179
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,733
no lube required, and...

180
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,156
I mean, there are many things
within SEC guidelines we can do

181
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,741
to express our
negative sentiment on it,

182
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,702
and convince others
to see it the same way,

183
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,705
- once it is trading publicly.
- There ya go.

184
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,415
That's where I
thought you were going.

185
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
But this is Mafee and
Dollar Bill's big investment.

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,460
Don't we still love--

187
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,044
I mean, have fond feelings for--

188
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,797
well,
most of us-- some of us-- I do...

189
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,090
Spit it out, you stuttering--

190
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,717
Mafee! I still care about Mafee.

191
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,469
Yes, as I do, Ben.

192
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,262
But once we find out who's
really going to run the SPAC

193
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,139
for them, Prince will block it,
and, yes,

194
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,475
whatever they've invested
in it will be worthless.

195
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,478
And he feels bad about it,
that fucking baby.

196
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,062
How can you not even care?

197
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,857
You were in an intimate
relationship with Dollar--

198
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,028
I am in a relationship with dollars,
end sentence.

199
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,363
Look,
I love those guys. For real.

200
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,240
We've plundered and partied
with 'em back in the day.

201
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,160
But if they fuck with our shit,
they get fucked.

202
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,958
Great to see the
team spirit is intact.

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,793
But I'm a builder,
not a destroyer.

204
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,212
I'll always find a
positive solution

205
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,464
before considering
a destructive path.

206
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,383
I look at every competitor
as a potential new partner...

207
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,052
right up until I can't anymore.

208
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,095
I'm on board with this approach.

209
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,138
We're happy.

210
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,432
- He's on his way up.
- Good.

211
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,142
We have an important visitor,

212
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,353
someone I'm convinced will
help win over the Commission.

213
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,438
Wags,
I want you on this detail with Scooter.

214
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,273
I'll sit in with you fellas.

215
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,192
Try to have fun.

216
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,527
We're a team.

217
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,111
So it seems.

218
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,072
Fab.

219
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,034
You believe in this
potential new partner bit?

220
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,203
I want to.

221
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,915
Sure, the president of

222
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,875
the International
Commission of Sport

223
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,919
does have some sway,

224
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,421
but there are 104
voting members,

225
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,883
enough of whom must be wooed,

226
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,135
convinced,
to influence the others

227
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,931
who aren't susceptible
to extracurricular handling.

228
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,267
Mike, you want to...

229
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,852
And I speak from experience,
selecting a host city

230
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,438
is a very political process.

231
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,773
Mr. Drache, how does it work?

232
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,358
I want to make an impression.

233
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,943
But as I understand it,

234
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,611
the men and women
of the Commission,

235
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,280
even those key few I might turn,

236
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,782
don't look kindly upon
strangers bearing gifts.

237
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,828
Because those strangers might
be wearing wires, mightn't they?

238
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,955
But they will take them from me.

239
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,165
Because I was one of them,

240
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:47,211
before what I refer
to as the "ugliness"

241
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,671
forced me out.

242
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,507
But trust,
I'm still one of them.

243
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,009
Good.

244
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,719
I'm glad I can count
on your endorsement

245
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,803
of my plan to land the Olympics.

246
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,307
Possibly.

247
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,226
Possibly?

248
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,854
Your reputation
speaks. It shouts.

249
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,316
And you certainly
seem a top man. But...

250
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,110
you're a little
late to this game.

251
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,445
L.A. had things locked.

252
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,821
Until they didn't.

253
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,199
Yeah,
until they didn't. Cheers to you.

254
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,576
He had nothing to do with that.

255
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,745
No. Of course not.
I'd never suggest.

256
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,912
You kinda did,

257
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,456
but we'll let it slide.

258
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,792
Look,
you can't have a Games without a stadium.

259
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,421
And New York doesn't have a
stadium suitable for the Games--

260
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,758
modern, able to be turned over
quickly depending on the event.

261
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,761
- But we will. I will.
- Will you?

262
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,638
Well, then you may have me too.

263
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,473
If it seems the thing to do.

264
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,475
Gentlemen, I get one shot

265
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,436
every two years between the
Summer and the Winter Games,

266
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,439
so I hew to the
Aintree approach:

267
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,815
stick with the favorite.

268
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,068
No time for long shots.

269
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,612
Eh, maybe we'll speak again.

270
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,490
Cheers.

271
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,913
Do we really need
that fucking guy?

272
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,164
Sadly, we do.

273
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,832
He's the best in the space.

274
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,377
A very small, rarified space.

275
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,296
Find out who
else he's talking to.

276
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,173
- And make those talks--
- Go south?

277
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,676
So he has nowhere else to
go but crawling back to us?

278
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,928
- More or less.
- I'm on it.

279
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,013
Be on it together.

280
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,183
- Yeah, about that--
- Are you serious?

281
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,811
You want us to be your
Tenspeed and Brown Shoe?

282
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,481
I'd have gone with Murtaugh and Riggs,
but, yes.

283
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,899
I am.

284
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,197
News on the land.

285
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,033
All the entities track
back to the same address.

286
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,535
Who're we talking about?

287
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,040
Oh.

288
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,252
Our Sam LeFrak
wannabe has surfaced.

289
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,511
Welcome, welcome.

290
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,304
Todd Krakow.

291
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,348
I see life in the Beltway
was a real sacrifice for you.

292
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,308
It was
an honor to serve,

293
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,060
but, frankly,
I rather enjoy being

294
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,645
back in the private sector.

295
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,188
I missed not having
to report to anyone.

296
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,982
We're all accountable
to each other

297
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,192
and tethered to
this rock by gravity.

298
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,194
If you take the time
to be in the moment...

299
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,822
right there,
you can even feel the Earth move.

300
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,991
Mmm.

301
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,701
I feel the sky

302
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,369
Tumbling down!

303
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,664
Goddamn that felt good. Yeah.

304
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,374
Couldn't do that in
a Cabinet meeting.

305
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,209
POTUS could, but that was it.

306
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,712
So, is, uh,
that what brings you here?

307
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,047
Wouldn't be a certain
real estate SPAC

308
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,424
set to IPO soon?

309
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,926
Not that I'm involved,
officially.

310
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,762
No. I want you to think bigger.

311
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,555
"Bigger?" Really?

312
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,056
Join my bid.

313
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,268
We agree on one
thing: New York would be

314
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,437
a superb host for
the next Olympics.

315
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,105
Not only am I a believer,
I also happen to be

316
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,399
a highly capitalized
partner to buy land with,

317
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,027
to make inroads
with the city and state

318
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,528
to help win over the Commission.

319
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,822
The Commission? Hmm.

320
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,451
Only a man with Colin Drache
in his employ can achieve that.

321
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,369
- Do you have him?
- Met today.

322
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,413
Seeing him again tomorrow.
So what do you think?

323
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,207
That's a no. Too many words.

324
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,210
Why fight over
possession of the fumble

325
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,878
when we can both
be on the same team?

326
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,214
I'd love a Mike Prince-type
onboard as a partner,

327
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:22,134
but, just so you know,
I'm QB'ing this baby.

328
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,428
What are you going for, huh?

329
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,764
Rehab your public image
after that precipitous fall

330
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,224
from Treasury?

331
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,726
Reboot your
Manhattan bona fides?

332
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,894
Get on TV?

333
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,729
- Meet chicks?

334
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,232
You tell me what it is,
and I'll help build the new you.

335
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,775
No, I don't think you get it.

336
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,778
Once we IPO and close
on these properties--

337
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,446
and I can see I'm not
gonna get your piece

338
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,323
near Stuy Town,
but I don't need it--

339
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,951
I skip right through the
permits to build a new stadium.

340
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,994
Does your bid have one
of those? Didn't think so.

341
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,789
With it, I land the Games,

342
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,291
and then I can have
whatever I want in this town.

343
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,710
So if you want to
be a part of my bid,

344
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,420
then make me a real offer.

345
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,548
That starts with buying
a major block of shares

346
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,050
when they IPO
tomorrow and I announce.

347
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,470
Otherwise, you may end up
having to wait in line to get tickets

348
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,055
like the Commoners.

349
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,640
Can you imagine?

350
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,854
Usually this is the part
where the guy on the other side

351
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,355
of the desk flexes, huffs, puffs

352
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,732
and makes vague
but serious threats.

353
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,736
I don't go to war that way.

354
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,740
I just go to war.

355
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,126
You ready to get going?

356
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,378
Already going.

357
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,963
There's a guy we
used to work with

358
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,381
who can follow Colin around,

359
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,300
do a deep dive into
his data and history,

360
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,510
and find out exactly
what makes him tick.

361
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,846
Let's put a pin in black bag ops

362
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,348
that'll put us right out of
business and maybe into jail.

363
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,559
Unless and until such time as.

364
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,685
Fine.

365
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,186
Shall we?

366
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,522
- You mean...?
- He said "together."

367
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,357
I'm aware.

368
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,817
Come to where I'm working.

369
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,319
When I'm not riding
shotgun with Prince,

370
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,570
it's where I'm set up.

371
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,625
What the hell is this?

372
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,585
You've never seen a power map?

373
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,086
Naturally. Just...

374
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,255
wondering where the hell
you got this information.

375
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,882
Welcome to the 21st century,
Wags.

376
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,508
I will be your guide.

377
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,177
We have Colin Drache's
business associates,

378
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,346
romantic partners,
places he frequents,

379
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,847
cologne of choice--

380
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,599
Dior Sauvage!

381
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,018
So that was the stench
hovering around him like Pig-Pen.

382
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,187
We can't trust a man who
wears cologne before 10 a.m.

383
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,897
We have to. By using this,

384
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,732
we'll determine his
spheres of influence,

385
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,525
figure out what he wants,

386
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,402
and then we'll be able to
identify which way he's leaning.

387
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,238
I hate to give you even an
ounce of satisfaction, Scooter,

388
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,448
but this is pretty fucking cool.

389
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,367
Of course it's cool. I made it.

390
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,285
But sadly, it's just a start.

391
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,788
Not surprised to see the bulk
of Colin's network's in Europe.

392
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,540
Yeah. Lot of likely cities in Europe,
though.

393
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,168
We do have these
kids who work here.

394
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,504
Very energetic,
sometimes annoying.

395
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,923
So PC,
they make John Hodgeman look like an iMac.

396
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,092
We should use them.

397
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,516
Hey, quantlings,
special assignment. Who wants in?

398
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,226
Here's a chance to
be useful for a change.

399
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,061
Your taunts don't
hurt me anymore.

400
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,688
I'm not sure millennials are
motivated by competition.

401
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,731
How 'bout this? You
both win a trophy.

402
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,484
We need you to do an internet
scrape of one Colin Drache.

403
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,111
You want us to hack someone?

404
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,071
- Black hat?
- That's kinda weird.

405
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,572
Not a hack.

406
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,491
Definitely not asking
you to hack anyone.

407
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,576
More like a perfectly legal
ex-girlfriend stalking job.

408
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,078
Oh,
this is more your wheelhouse.

409
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,454
We need to
see who he's talking to.

410
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,248
He's our in to the Commission.

411
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,916
We need to know what other
cities he may be dancing with

412
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,334
and which way he's leaning.

413
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,627
I'll send you the details.

414
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,920
What do we get if we help?

415
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,630
My foot not up your ass?

416
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,258
Honestly, that approach
doesn't work with my generation.

417
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,010
Oh,
you're about to see how well it--

418
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,636
What do you want?

419
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,138
To borrow his
Bentley for a weekend.

420
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,389
You got it.

421
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,564
I decided to kill the
pending land bank deals.

422
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,233
Turn 'em down. Open up
a new application process.

423
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,569
I'd like us to issue
a press release,

424
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,821
then we string Krakow up
for trying to make a land grab

425
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,240
for illicit purposes
before his SPAC even--

426
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,783
You screwed me out
of my Treasury gig,

427
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,910
now you're trying
to do it again!

428
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,287
What's the name of that

429
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,747
Randy Rogers Band
song I like so much?

430
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,248
- "Speak Of The Devil"?
- That's the one.

431
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,458
I'll go get started.

432
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,917
I just don't understand

433
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,669
why you'd side with
Mike Prince on this.

434
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,171
Mike Prince?

435
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,256
Uh,
you think I sided with him to--

436
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,800
Uh,
the land bank killed my transactions.

437
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,552
We had to.

438
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,471
Because like so many
others in the billionaire class,

439
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,973
you're using loopholes
to game the system.

440
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,393
Using private shell
companies to buy public lands?

441
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,521
Veiling disclosures about land
use for community redevelopment?

442
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,399
It may not be illegal,
but it's unethical.

443
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,359
So is your office
accepting graft,

444
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,403
- but that didn't stop you.
- From whom?

445
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,406
Oh, uh,
I suppose we're back to Mike Prince.

446
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,409
You know he just wants
the land for himself.

447
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,745
- How'd he get you on his side?
- He didn't.

448
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,748
But if he tries the same tactic,
he'll face the same scrutiny.

449
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,042
Whatever gig he's offering
you with the Commish,

450
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,711
I'll up it if you restore
my transactions.

451
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,506
- Commish. Right. Sure.
- The Olympic Commission.

452
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,174
Is he gonna give you
something with teeth,

453
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,718
- or something ceremonial?
- Oh.

454
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,515
You two are trying to steer
the Olympics to the City.

455
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,851
May seem weird now,
but Mitt Romney was a fucking god

456
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,895
when he brought
them to Salt Lake.

457
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,647
I could use some
of that social capital.

458
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,149
Turn it into actual
capital. Ka-ching.

459
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,985
Don't make the
cash register sound.

460
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,862
I would never.

461
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,241
So you get this land,
you lead the effort,

462
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,369
you become the chair of the
New York City Commission.

463
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,079
You win, and Prince suffers?

464
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,664
Humiliations galore.

465
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,792
Perhaps we can work this out.

466
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,879
Resubmit you applications,
cards up.

467
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,048
Transparency will
protect us both.

468
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,217
Being open and honest
has never worked for me,

469
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,927
but... I'll try anything.

470
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,470
And, matter of fact,
I will take something.

471
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,305
I'll steer infrastructure

472
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,975
so the people of this city
benefit from all the spending,

473
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,894
and so they don't just end
up with abandoned venues

474
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,146
like Rio's Olympic Park.

475
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,689
That place is a
fucking dustbowl.

476
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,233
You're a true steward of the people,
Chuck.

477
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,277
- Mm-hm.
- I appreciate the consideration.

478
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,528
We have a deal.

479
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,696
Good.

480
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,780
Ka-ching.

481
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,918
Let's, uh,
hold a beat on the press conference.

482
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,753
What's up?

483
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,381
Our friend Krakow will get
his shot at the land after all.

484
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,550
How? And more importantly, why?

485
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,719
A different way,
with some different codicils--

486
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,096
That greed-driven
Meisterburger gets to bite off

487
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,223
a big part of the city that
we're supposed to safeguard?

488
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,434
To invite redevelopment
into those areas of the city,

489
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,810
don't we need developers?

490
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,478
Not ones who
bypass public approval

491
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,272
to do whatever
the hell they want.

492
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,316
This project doesn't advance
without my guiding hand.

493
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,775
It's for the greater good.

494
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,611
It may not feel that way now,
but it is.

495
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,654
It certainly doesn't
feel that way.

496
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,364
- It feels more like--
- Understood, Mrs. Sacker.

497
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,873
Mr. Mateo.

498
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,499
Mr. Prince.

499
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,792
It turns out my
partnership overtures

500
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,753
weren't met with open arms.

501
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,349
Was that about the Dollar
Bill and Mafee SPAC?

502
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,018
Did he assign
you to sanction it?

503
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,102
Like Nicholai Hel?

504
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,521
It's out of my hands.

505
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,398
That means you
are gonna sanction it.

506
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,692
Kill it. Them.

507
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,027
Shit.

508
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,612
Shit.

509
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,532
Are you still okay
with Prince going after

510
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,201
our former compatriots?
Because he is.

511
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,870
I'm surprised Mafee was
so forthcoming with you

512
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,872
considering he hadn't
suggested any real estate

513
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,874
- speculation with me.
- You and Mafee talk, too?

514
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,417
Of course. We're friends.

515
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,919
We have a standing
weekly dinner.

516
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,921
So then you have to
agree we should save them.

517
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,756
If they are anti-fragile,
they will survive

518
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,841
and thrive no matter
what Prince does.

519
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,843
And if not, well,
I have to take the long view.

520
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,178
So harsh.

521
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,346
That's the way of the gun.

522
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,847
And you're okay with it.

523
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,641
The gun doesn't care
what I'm okay with.

524
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,530
The ruination of the High
Plains SPAC is coming,

525
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,282
and I feel terrible.

526
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,075
I can't focus through the guilt.

527
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,618
You want to be a martyr,
be my guest,

528
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,953
but you're not gonna
find any grenades

529
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,788
to throw yourself onto in here.

530
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,290
I'm the one who put
them in the crosshairs.

531
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,125
Inadvertently.

532
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,419
You woke half the team
in the middle of the night.

533
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,962
That's advertent.

534
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,964
Because we have a lot
riding on the Olympics.

535
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,969
Beyond that, though?

536
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,013
It's... my job.

537
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,807
I could say you're
a PM in a fund

538
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,642
20 times the size of theirs.

539
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,312
Mafee sloppily showed his hand,
you went all in against it.

540
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,315
In what world does that
make you the bad guy?

541
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,942
If you did, I might feel better.

542
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,862
And if I agreed you let
down your moral code?

543
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,281
Worse.

544
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,991
And I'd probably sulk.

545
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,910
So then...

546
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,163
own the fact that Mafee
doesn't work here anymore.

547
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,664
Neither does Dollar Bill.

548
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,499
- Well, yeah, but--
- We're competitors now.

549
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,586
I know. But couldn't I at least
warn them what's coming?

550
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,087
Sure. But play that out.

551
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,964
You'd get fired,
and you'd never work again

552
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,091
because everyone would
know you fed our plays

553
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,093
to the competition
because you're you,

554
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,137
and the world's the world,
and that is what will happen.

555
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,098
Wish I hadn't said anything now.

556
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,059
Can't put that shit
back in the goose.

557
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,979
You don't want
to feel bad again,

558
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,023
act differently. Beforehand.

559
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,525
In the meantime,
you're just gonna have to feel

560
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,027
two things at once because

561
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,738
that's what life demands of us.

562
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,826
Thanks, I guess.

563
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,286
I don't feel any better.

564
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,708
Seems to be my
specialty of late.

565
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,175
Tell me, Ben Kim,

566
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,261
do you wish you'd left with
them and stayed loyal to Axe?

567
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,597
Do you?

568
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,768
No.

569
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,772
But I, too,
admire what Mafee and DB did.

570
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,149
Know that.

571
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,943
Then do something.

572
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,833
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

573
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:42,129
Tryin' to make a livin'
and doin' the best I can

574
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,924
And when it's time for leavin'

575
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,261
I hope you'll understand

576
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,889
That I was born a ramblin' man

577
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:58,478
My father was a
gambler down in Georgia

578
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,984
And he wound up on
the wrong end of a gun

579
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,653
And I was born in the back seat

580
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,990
Of a Greyhound bus

581
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:14,786
Rollin' down highway 41

582
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:19,708
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

583
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,876
That's it.

584
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,044
That's enough.

585
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,629
Come on, ladies.

586
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,256
I think destiny is calling us.

587
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,383
And when it's time for leavin'

588
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,095
I hope you'll understand
that I was born...

589
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,890
Prince says we should add
Krakow to the list of Colin's suitors.

590
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,641
- Figures.
- Prince will knock him off.

591
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,059
We just have to
focus on whoever else.

592
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,145
- What's with the stuff?
- My office.

593
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,605
It's yours now. You take it.

594
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,898
- I'm fine--
- Nope.

595
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,941
I'm not unaware of the workflow.

596
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,818
You take it. I'll decamp here.

597
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,154
You sure?

598
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,281
As it should be.

599
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,991
On your way.

600
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,343
Welcome Mayor Johnson.

601
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,231
I get it. You need the room.

602
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,529
I see I'm not the only
new blood in town.

603
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,949
I hope to do in the hedge fund
space what you undoubtedly

604
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,742
will do in City Hall, Ms. Mayor.

605
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,832
I'm coming home, boys!

606
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,844
Mayor Johnson,
I'll keep this brief.

607
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,221
When I supported your campaign,

608
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,098
I promised to come
to you with big ideas.

609
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,183
You supported my
competitors as well.

610
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,768
But go on.

611
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,812
What would you say
to one of my competitors

612
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,855
concealing his efforts
to lure the Olympics here

613
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,440
without consulting you first?

614
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,608
Oh, that?

615
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,277
No new stadium, no bid.

616
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,611
Who is it?

617
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,446
Former Treasury Sec Todd Krakow.

618
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,282
He hasn't announced yet,
but it's him.

619
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,117
Hmm.

620
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,868
Maybe he has the juice,
but I'm not convinced. For when?

621
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,371
The Games need a
new host city for 2028.

622
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,999
That is a tight turnaround.

623
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,834
And the stadium
faced a lot of opposition

624
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,419
last time this idea was floated.

625
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,546
Because it's bad for
Manhattan. For congestion,

626
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,590
for affordable housing,
for the environment.

627
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,843
Okay. So you want to bring
this to the City Council to kill?

628
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,386
You could.

629
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,179
But I believe you
stand more to gain

630
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,181
by speaking out
against it yourself.

631
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,433
How's that?

632
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,351
- You're America's mayor.

633
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,936
With your new profile,

634
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,730
you'd shine a
spotlight on my plan

635
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,440
to build a stadium
in Westchester.

636
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,234
You'd come out
looking like a hero

637
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,029
for putting community
impact ahead of a photo op

638
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,947
and the whims of a rich guy.

639
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,159
I'm not interested
in what it looks like,

640
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,828
and I'm not interested in
making the same mistakes

641
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,496
as the idiot I replaced.

642
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,373
The mistake the idiot
who came before you made

643
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,584
was not caring
what stuff looked like.

644
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,295
Which is why he left
office as a punchline.

645
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,797
Hmm.

646
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,096
- They aren't gonna budge.
- You know for sure?

647
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,190
You know
who invented steam?

648
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,900
John Fitch.

649
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,485
Steam power, anyway.

650
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,237
The state legislature gave
him a 14-year monopoly

651
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,739
to come up with a
commercial use for it.

652
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,658
But Fitch fucked it up,

653
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,243
lost the monopoly
because he couldn't do it.

654
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,080
Steam power
transformed the world,

655
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,500
but the man who
invented it died penniless.

656
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,626
Killed himself.

657
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,294
That's a sad story.

658
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,921
Should come with a trigger
warning for the ending.

659
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,839
The ending is the warning.

660
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,219
You two are all
in on a steamboat,

661
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,929
but you're gonna
end up like Fitch.

662
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,682
You want to keep
affording these offices

663
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,266
and your business,
you need to listen.

664
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,894
Prince knows all about the SPAC

665
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,437
and the Olympic play,

666
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,814
and he's lining up to
destroy whatever it is

667
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,107
- you're bringing out.
- Wait.

668
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,566
How the fuck does Prince know

669
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,609
about the Olympics piece?

670
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,653
Shit. It was Ben Kim.

671
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,279
How the fuck does Ben Kim know?

672
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,240
I didn't tell him anything.

673
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,117
You know that this is the
moment when the detective

674
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,577
realizes you killed the guy,
right?

675
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,955
No one accused you of anything yet,
Mafee,

676
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,581
but you're proclaiming
your innocence,

677
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,084
which tells me
you're guilty as fuck.

678
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,460
What did you tell him?

679
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,003
I didn't tell him
the whole play.

680
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,464
Well,
I guess I gave him enough clues.

681
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,299
Prince knows. That's
all that matters now.

682
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,802
No. What matters
to you is Prince.

683
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,847
But I give no shits about
what matters to you, or him.

684
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,058
And we are not walking away
from a Mayweather-Pacquiao payday

685
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,185
so that Michael
Prince can take it.

686
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,021
We're
already in position.

687
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,107
Our incoming partner
has the land on lock.

688
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,569
Why not bring your boss in

689
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,238
to High Plains and
ride the wave with us?

690
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,991
Boys...

691
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,659
here's how this is gonna go.

692
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,661
When the IPO happens,
you're gonna feel like winners,

693
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,079
like you've finally made it.

694
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,748
But when Prince
kills the Olympic play,

695
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,125
the SPAC is gonna liquidate,
and you're gonna drown.

696
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,545
You need to abandon your plan.

697
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,672
Pull the filing
while you still can,

698
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,383
before you wreck your
reputations and lose your money.

699
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,145
Appreciate you
coming to us with this.

700
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,147
Do you?

701
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,815
First time here,
it's like you squatted

702
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,233
in the middle of the office

703
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,693
and took a big steaming
dump on the floor,

704
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,320
but we know when we're beat.

705
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,197
Speaking of dumps,
we've got some calls to make,

706
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,532
to some investors that are
gonna be plenty disappointed

707
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,493
we cancelled the
offering. We better get to it.

708
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,079
You two are terrible liars,

709
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,332
and you're pulling
from my playbook.

710
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,711
You're not going to heed my warning,
are you?

711
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,963
You wouldn't risk
your career like this.

712
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,965
So you're here at his behest.

713
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,967
And we don't do behest anymore.

714
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:09,098
What does he think he means,
they don't "do behest?"

715
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,725
It doesn't matter.

716
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,102
Dollar Bill and Mafee
are on a blind profit run,

717
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,897
and they're not going
to protect themselves.

718
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,565
Is there anything
else we can do?

719
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,818
Prince's plan is smart,
thoughtful,

720
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,110
and benefits a lot of people.

721
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,612
Especially people
at this company,

722
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,281
especially people at this desk. So,
no.

723
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,659
If I thought we could
save Dollar Bill and Mafee

724
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,119
from themselves long-term,
I'd do it.

725
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,830
I care for them,
Mafee especially.

726
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,582
But, like I told Ben,
they are who they are.

727
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,585
And, I guess, so are we.

728
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,845
It is my pleasure
to announce that

729
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,513
I will be spearheading the
High Plains Management

730
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,350
real estate SPAC
rolling out as we speak.

731
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,562
Consider it a Krak-SPAC,
if you will.

732
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,355
Once funded,
the company will purchase properties

733
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,982
along the East
River in Manhattan

734
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,276
earmarked for redevelopment,

735
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,027
bringing new life
to the community

736
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,863
by building an
all-weather stadium,

737
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,282
seating capacity for 85,000

738
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,200
and a retractable roof.

739
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,830
Zoning laws were
created for this very reason,

740
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,456
to protect tenant rights

741
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,458
and small business owners.

742
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,460
These are the people
who put me in office.

743
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,797
And I will not let the
Todd Krakows of the world

744
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,674
bulldoze their livelihoods

745
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,051
with plans to build
a nonessential

746
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,845
new stadium in Manhattan.

747
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,222
I won't fast-track it.

748
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,849
I won't even allow zoning for it

749
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,392
without it first going
through extensive

750
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,186
community, committee

751
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,855
and environmental reviews.

752
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,732
And I mean extensive.

753
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,358
I'm talking years.

754
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,027
Boom.

755
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,029
She dropped the payload.

756
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,655
Time to raid the villages.

757
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,536
Thank you. We'll get you those
architectural plans tout suite.

758
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,413
- Ciao.
-  Great, thanks.

759
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,259
Oh fuck!

760
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,180
Fuck!

761
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,599
That Krakow SPAC IPO?

762
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,226
You should know,
it's not as rosy as you thought.

763
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,020
The rezoning's
just the beginning.

764
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,398
Krakow is getting machinegunned
like Elias in Platoon.

765
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,193
- Thing's taking a dirt nap.
- MPC has cleared a lane

766
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,903
for a stadium deal of our own.

767
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,280
We've got green lights all
the way to breaking ground.

768
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,908
But I'm your transport
out of the 'Nam.

769
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,451
I'm glad to hear that.

770
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,703
You're smart to stay
away from Krakow.

771
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,501
Dude,
you're not going through your list.

772
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,087
I will.

773
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,463
Just give me sec.

774
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,352
We found out Colin's
a rabid footballer.

775
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,437
- How rabid?
- Keeper at his club rabid.

776
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,523
Three trips across the
globe to see matches

777
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,233
during the pandemic rabid.

778
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,235
So he likes football,
as do millions.

779
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,236
We looked deeper.

780
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,654
There's an opening.

781
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,750
The IPO busted before it
even opened for trading.

782
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,293
I saw the
Exchange halt it

783
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,920
shortly after the
mayor's statement.

784
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,256
No money raised.
Krakow can't back his bids.

785
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,717
And Dollar Bill and Mafee can't
collect any sponsorship fees.

786
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,764
Look,
I didn't go into this to do damage,

787
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,641
but from my vantage,

788
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,685
we're destabilizing a bad actor,

789
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,854
saving the Games from
the corruption and exclusion

790
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:46,190
that follow men like Krakow,
who only see a payday in this.

791
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,984
But the land,

792
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,694
that's still worth
something to me.

793
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,654
I thought we were
building in Westchester.

794
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,823
Crown jewel was always
the waterfront in Manhattan.

795
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,491
We're just gonna build
there the right way.

796
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,201
Oh, this is Spanish Prisoner.

797
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,286
We're not at the blowoff yet.

798
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,412
There's another act coming.

799
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,706
You'll see soon enough.

800
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,301
I hope you've had some time
to consider my original offer,

801
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,387
though I'd say you've waived
the chance to negotiate.

802
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,139
I somehow thought
you were different.

803
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,307
But your approach
reminds me a lot

804
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,975
of the man whose
office you took.

805
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,186
It's possible you bring
out a similar reaction

806
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,854
in wildly disparate individuals.

807
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,856
I'll think it over when
I drink your blood

808
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,483
after decapitating you.

809
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,526
Accepting loss is hard
for those who lack humility.

810
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,695
But here's a reality check.

811
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,655
You have deals
with the City on land,

812
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,324
but your SPAC is liquidated

813
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,825
and you don't have
the capital to close.

814
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,912
My investors dumped
me like Winthorpe

815
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,997
and Billy Ray Valentine
in the orange juice pit.

816
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,249
That's the problem with
other people's money.

817
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,376
They can take it away from you.

818
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,587
So,
you'll either go into your pocket--

819
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,923
For a billion dollars of
New York fucking real estate

820
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,258
that you got the mayor to
oppose zoning changes on?!

821
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,927
Don't think so.

822
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,386
I like being rich.

823
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,638
Not gonna end up like Trump.

824
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,223
Or you'll...

825
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,850
Partner with you.

826
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,727
Fine.

827
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,313
Forget drinking your blood,
I'll stand with you instead.

828
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,524
I'll assign the deeds to you,

829
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,400
you and your investors pay.

830
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,194
And I'll be starting QB.

831
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,988
That's fine. It's fine.

832
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,866
Just know we'll be spitting
in Chuck Rhoades's eye.

833
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,743
Hey, don't worry.

834
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,786
I'll handle him.

835
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,973
I can't fucking believe
it. Here you are.

836
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,267
I thought, "There's no way
Taylor would think our dinner's

837
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,769
still on after their firm destroyed
my goddamn company."

838
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,979
But here you are.

839
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,564
It's unfortunate the
way the IPO went,

840
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,982
that the SPAC is zeroed out.

841
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,650
I understand you were
warned not to launch it.

842
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,944
One is business,
the other personal.

843
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,445
- I don't see the linkage.
- You thought you could just

844
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,072
sit across from me,
enjoying those

845
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,533
bok choy pot stickers,
while my life is falling apart,

846
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,286
because of you and the
company you help run?

847
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,038
I knew you were
a fucking cyborg.

848
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,915
And I thought about
letting you sit there

849
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,709
and put the pieces
together on your own.

850
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,711
But I had to see for
myself just how devoid

851
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,880
of all human
understanding you are.

852
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,673
I...

853
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,947
Spain's coming hard.

854
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,824
They somehow convinced
Real Madrid's manager

855
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,492
to give Drache soccer lessons,

856
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,119
all to win him over
to the Madrid effort.

857
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,163
Meaning they figured
out what matters to him.

858
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,707
Wasn't hard. Guy
raises millions for ALS.

859
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,460
So we back up the Brinks truck,

860
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,170
help cure a disease,

861
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,671
and the guy becomes a hero.

862
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,382
And Colin never walks
onto Madrid's pitch.

863
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,638
I'm have a sudden
craving for croquetas.

864
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,931
Want to put in an order?

865
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,599
Sure. Pull up a menu.

866
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,518
Alexa, play my faves playlist.

867
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,939
Playlist faves
on Amazon music.

868
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,037
You put this song
on your playlist?

869
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,122
Don't tell me you have a
problem with Harry Chapin.

870
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,209
No,
I just didn't realize you had any taste.

871
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,335
Oh...

872
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,711
Thanks.

873
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,671
I think.

874
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,048
While I was away

875
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,926
And he was talking 'fore I knew it,
and as he grew...

876
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,344
This song.

877
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,430
It used to hit me as the son.

878
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,600
Now it hits me as the father.

879
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,227
And the cat's in the cradle...

880
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,478
You?

881
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,482
Yeah.

882
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,651
Both.

883
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,946
But we'll get together then

884
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,366
You know we'll have
a good time then

885
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,092
I said I was fine
with what we did,

886
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,011
but maybe I didn't
see it through.

887
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,513
The associated loss,
in human terms.

888
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,557
I didn't see all the
possible outcomes.

889
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,100
After Mafee left the firm,

890
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,352
I always thought of
us as Bird and Magic.

891
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,687
Kill each other on the court,

892
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,147
but best friends
in the off-season.

893
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,941
We were never
trained to be worried

894
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,568
about unintended consequences.

895
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,611
The win was all that mattered,

896
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,989
and our success only
reinforced that idea.

897
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,326
I say "we were trained,"
but in truth,

898
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,077
I did most of that training,

899
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,831
which is why I guess my
attempt to undo it was clumsy.

900
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,917
The blame isn't just,
or even mostly, on you.

901
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,878
I keep getting sucked
back into the short game,

902
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,005
and I promised myself I
wouldn't do that anymore.

903
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,841
To be fair, your short game
is everyone else's long game.

904
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,093
That only makes it
more disappointing.

905
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,014
So then what actions are you...

906
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,018
are we going to
take to rectify it?

907
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,116
- Here we are again.
- The game has changed.

908
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,160
We need to put the stadium
in Manhattan after all.

909
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,996
- Built at no cost to the city.
- What about the congestion?

910
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,415
Affordable housing?
Impact on the environment?

911
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,500
None of that will be a problem

912
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,918
the way he's going to do it.

913
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,920
Sustainable.
Repurposable. Cutting edge.

914
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,130
And how am I not gonna
look like a flip-flopper?

915
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,216
You're gonna look like
a brilliant negotiator.

916
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,051
You have leveraged
the real estate community

917
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,512
to band together to
build low-income housing

918
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,305
unlike the City has seen before.

919
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,808
- State-of-the-art.
- Because first it's gonna be...

920
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,309
Yes. Athletes' quarters.

921
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,353
Built at the lowest
possible cost to the city,

922
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,854
by one of our great builders.

923
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,149
You mean if you win,
Chuck Rhoades suffers?

924
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,568
Humiliations galore.

925
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,488
Bud Lazzara's on board?

926
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,907
Not only that,
we have the site and surrounding property,

927
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,742
and a healthy war
chest to close on it with.

928
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,912
Most importantly,
you have my word and a witness.

929
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,002
Then let the Games begin.

930
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,929
Might want to watch your step.

931
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,432
There's blood
all over the floor.

932
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,434
Guess it wasn't good
enough you killed our IPO.

933
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,061
You just had to do a
stiff fucking pile driver

934
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,896
without protecting our necks.

935
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,567
Oh, no, I've got you tucked
safely between my thighs.

936
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,235
Kayfabe all the way.

937
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,237
- I've spoken to Prince.
- And what?

938
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,656
He wants to offer
us our old jobs back?

939
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,491
I'm not walking backwards.

940
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,659
Neither is Mafee.

941
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,161
Well, I'd consider it,

942
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,954
but no.

943
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,956
We know the SPAC was
going to be your opportunity.

944
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,625
Prince asked Spartan-Ives
to fund you instead.

945
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,211
Spartan will write the check,
as a make-good to Prince.

946
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,380
Meaning?

947
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,965
They saved our asses.

948
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,718
At what price? We
got to show fealty?

949
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,636
Pledge our firstborn sons? What?

950
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,598
How about you take this as
an object lesson, free of charge.

951
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,475
You're not giant-killers.

952
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,767
Don't go swinging your swords

953
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,394
into a battles
you've already lost.

954
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,771
I lobbied for this too,
to square things with us.

955
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,274
Suddenly had a conscience
program installed?

956
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,151
- Did you go to Wendy for that?
- I did seek her counsel,

957
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,153
to remind me what I value most.

958
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,613
So, what, Taylor?

959
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,490
A friendship where I'm
watching every word I say

960
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,325
for fear you're going to
gouge me in the eye later?

961
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,452
I won't offer you any empty platitudes,
Mafee.

962
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,454
But I would like a
chance to talk this through,

963
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,830
repair our trust.

964
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,916
Are we back on for
our regular dinners?

965
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,169
We are.

966
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,965
Did you hear that, Ben Kim?

967
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,509
My god, that was brutal.

968
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,636
But thank you.

969
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,095
Thank you!

970
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,848
Oh, thank Christ.

971
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,350
We didn't blow up!

972
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,853
Mortimer, we're back!

973
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,116
So, this happened.

974
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,285
And Mayor Tess is about to
give another press conference

975
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,954
reversing field.

976
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,330
Prince got to Krakow?

977
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,540
And the mayor.

978
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,375
Prince got Krakow's stadium?!

979
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,797
The way I see it,
you dangled our land

980
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,549
to get a preferred outcome,

981
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,676
and now, instead of a good
initiative against one bad pony,

982
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,719
we've lost it to a pair of 'em.

983
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,514
No, wait.

984
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,350
Wait. In a way,
this actually helps us.

985
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,893
I'm not seeing it.

986
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,853
This proves my point,
doesn't it?

987
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,188
Billionaires plot in secret

988
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,023
to take everything
for themselves.

989
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,900
And the laws protect
their rights to do so.

990
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,527
Prince may have the land,

991
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,028
but he doesn't have
the people that live on it.

992
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,572
Is he going to start
buying people now?

993
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,906
Bet he would if he could.

994
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,200
- We can't let him.
- Uh-oh.

995
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,785
Are we about to see the
return of Farmer Chuck?

996
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,620
What'd Bruce say?

997
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,997
"Wherever there's a fight

998
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,707
against the blood
and hatred in the air,

999
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,668
look for me, Mom,
I'll be there."

1000
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,837
I promise I will
think of something

1001
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,672
to make it clear that
we are the stewards

1002
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,549
of the best interests of
the people of New York,

1003
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,217
and not Prince or Krakow.

1004
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,927
How?

1005
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,766
I need to take a little walk.

1006
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,435
That's how.

1007
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,448
You ready for the Colin meeting?

1008
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,408
Yep. Your office?

1009
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,826
Our office.

1010
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,589
I saw what you were
doing with the selfless

1011
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,591
"donate the office"
play. Very elevated.

1012
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,134
Bonding up with the guys.

1013
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,261
Reifying your status as
their sergeant on the ground.

1014
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,387
Can't let you get away with it.

1015
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,681
- No?
- Uh-uh.

1016
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:03,766
So you actually wanna...?

1017
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,809
That's right. We share.

1018
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,441
Seems our good friend
Mr. Drache is back.

1019
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,486
Colin, please,
as we'll be all working together.

1020
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,572
So, Todd Krakow no longer
has need of your services?

1021
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,574
Alas, no. Nor Spain.

1022
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,911
They seem to be the type that
reneges on their prior promises.

1023
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,329
While you seem
like the soccer type.

1024
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,081
We're pretty tight
with David Beckham.

1025
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,624
Maybe there'll be
an opportunity for him

1026
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,958
to be on the pitch with you

1027
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,002
when he comes to
town for the Games.

1028
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,962
Don't worry, you're home now.

1029
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,923
I certainly see that.

1030
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,257
I'll let you fellas get started.

1031
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,842
I have a press
conference to attend.

1032
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,473
There's no better time
to welcome the world

1033
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,141
back to New York City.

1034
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,185
I want to introduce
the man with the vision

1035
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,646
and personal
investment as our partner,

1036
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,358
the chairman of the NYC
2028 Olympic Commission,

1037
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,651
Michael Prince.

1038
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,156
- Thank you, Mayor Johnson.

1039
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,742
We both share the same vision

1040
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,412
of what a Summer Games
in New York should look like...

1041
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,248
...an event for everyone.

1042
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,834
A chance to showcase and rebuild

1043
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,669
in all five boroughs.

1044
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,171
But I don't think
the taxpayer...

1045
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,548
- ...should shoulder the burden

1046
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,674
of the costs.

1047
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,720
My approach incentivizes...

1048
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,306
...the private
sector to join me...

1049
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,058
Get out of
the fuckin' street!

1050
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,602
Move the fuckin' car, bro!

1051
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,900
Get out of the way!

1052
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,573
All right, back it up.

1053
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,583
Oh,
I think we've got their attention.

1054
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,088
So they want to
revitalize the City?

1055
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,798
These plutocrats?

1056
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,218
Have they thought about
the unintended consequences

1057
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,803
to the average citizen?

1058
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,973
Do they think about the
average citizen at all?

1059
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,059
I am not in this for the
goddamned Bronx Cheer.

1060
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,729
Nobody told me about
the "fuck you" parade.

1061
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,566
This is the traffic for
a press conference.

1062
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,570
What will New York look like
when the traffic quintuples?

1063
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,120
A cabal of billionaires
remaking the city.

1064
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,457
What the hell do they know
about the real New York?

1065
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,627
How many people
will be displaced

1066
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,545
so they can build
an Olympic stadium?

1067
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,255
Yeah.

1068
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,716
Have they at all considered
what real New Yorkers

1069
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,301
want for our city?

1070
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:48,555
Maybe we should
remind them who we are.

1071
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,182
Yeah?

1072
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,980
What do we do when
the carpetbaggers

1073
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,858
and the land barons try
to shove us out of the way?

1074
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,194
- We shove back!
-  Yeah!

1075
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:06,448
- We shove back!
- Yeah!

1076
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,661
That's right.

1077
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,248
And together, the people,

1078
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,291
and those who
represent the people,

1079
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,586
we will take back our city!

1080
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,047
Take back our city!

1081
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,967
- Take back our city!
- Take back our city!

1082
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,719
Take back our city!

1083
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:32,266
Take back our city!

1084
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:36,645
- Take back our city!
- Take back our city!

1085
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,772
Take back our city!

1086
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,776
- Take back our city!
- Take back our city!

1087
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,279
Take back our city!

1088
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,115
The time is right for fighting

1089
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:51,869
In the street, boy

1090
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,455
But what can a poor boy do

1091
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:58,709
Except to sing for
A rock 'n' roll band

1092
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,296
'Cause in sleepy London town

1093
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,923
There's just no place for

1094
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,927
A street fighting man

1095
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,554
No

1096
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,355
Hey!

1097
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,566
Think the time is right for

1097
00:48:23,305 --> 00:49:23,272
