1
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,840
Previously
on Billions.

2
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,709
I want to introduce
the chairman of

3
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:10,345
the NYC 2028
Olympic Commission,

4
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,346
- Michael Prince.

5
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,814
Thank you, Mayor Johnson.

6
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,782
You promised me
a winning season, Chuck.

7
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,284
Running out of time
before I'll have to quit,

8
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:17,852
campaign 25/8.

9
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,488
I can't lose my MVP yet.
I need you, Kate.

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,090
Chuck Rhoades is fucking
with our Wi-Fi play.

11
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:24,492
The only winner in
this hopeless fucking outing

12
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,927
is gonna be your
chief legal counsel.

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,729
You think I'm
concerned because you

14
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,697
brought my Wi-Fi play
back to Chuck?

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,866
It's how I know that you'll
serve me loyally as well,

16
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,868
until I help get you
elected to Congress.

17
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,103
You made a deal that you
knew would displease me.

18
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,839
I thought we could actually
change the world.

19
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,441
If you want to change the world,
nine digits ain't gonna do it.

20
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,576
How could you, Kate?

21
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,744
After all I taught you.

22
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,846
You made me wait.

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,180
What if the professor
isn't done teaching?

24
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,782
This is business.

25
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,450
This is what not having
a soft landing feels like.

26
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,752
You tear your butt
when you hit the ground.

27
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,787
Mike Prince and his daughters

28
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,821
made the world
a better place today.

29
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,491
I lost my advantage.

30
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,993
I failed to protect
my goddamn queen.

31
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,795
Welcome to
Michael Prince Capital, Kate.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,074
Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports
www.admitme.app

33
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,885
My God, let me finish!

34
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,953
When was I not
letting you finish?

35
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:44,105
Worked pretty well in
Stand and Deliver too.

36
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,473
Life lesson,

37
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,075
always carry a cleaver.

38
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,744
Oh, wait. No.

39
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,312
That's not really the lesson.

40
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,947
The lesson is,

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,184
know how to change
the mood in a room quickly

42
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,852
and with authority.

43
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,720
Now, look, I get
what you're fighting over.

44
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:00,888
I do.

45
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,790
Coding team wants
more of the budget

46
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,926
because you can't make
a great app without great code.

47
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,094
Sales team wants more because
who cares about the damn code--

48
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,263
You want to start moving
product out the door.

49
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,165
Same with the marketing group.

50
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,766
But here's the deal.

51
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,270
Your customer can have
two of these,

52
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,772
not three.

53
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,774
Cheap and fast
can't also be good.

54
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,742
Good and fast
can't also be cheap.

55
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,679
So you can fight over turf,

56
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,013
or...

57
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,550
you can figure out a vision.

58
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,487
Let the budget sort itself out.

59
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,521
Or I can double it.

60
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,991
Everybody gets what they want,

61
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,960
and I get a word
with the teacher outside.

62
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,128
Not sure that's
the right lesson.

63
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,231
Most important one:
"Money makes the rules."

64
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,133
I'm surprised an esteemed
charter school like this

65
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,669
hasn't hammered it
into their heads.

66
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,339
Why scrap over capital
when you can raise it?

67
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,474
Group, we're gonna take five

68
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,576
while Mr. Prince
makes out his check.

69
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,614
If you came here
to impress a bunch of

70
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,082
teenage entrepreneurs...

71
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,183
Trying to impress you.

72
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,318
Hire you.
How am I doing?

73
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,653
You opening a charter school?

74
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,488
Not for your side gig.
Your main gig.

75
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,390
They take care of me
at the fund I'm at.

76
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,660
Hmm-hmm. That's why your
resume's floating around.

77
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,862
In my weaker moments,
I sometimes think about

78
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,064
what I could do in a place
built for speed and power.

79
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,932
Then you're
talking to the right guy.

80
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,409
Um,

81
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,576
what'd you do?

82
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,879
Nothing.

83
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,748
Women can be irrational,
we know this.

84
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,316
"We" do not.
What'd you do?

85
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,584
Not a thing.

86
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,753
I went unattended
to a couples dinner.

87
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,188
Willow had a cold,
so Roxanne couldn't go.

88
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,424
And the distaff side of
the other couple

89
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,126
was a fetching brunette...

90
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,027
Yeah, you had an affair.

91
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,762
Spare me the Penthouse Forum.

92
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,264
No-siree-Bob.
Nothing physical.

93
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,033
Developed a kinship

94
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,403
with Judith Felker,
Ron's wife,

95
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,139
over how thin the consommé was.

96
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:01,475
So uh, Roxanne kicked you out
over dinner table chatter?

97
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:04,078
Well, the next six days
of text chatter didn't help.

98
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:08,082
Did you know that Face ID
works when you're asleep?

99
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,383
Why wouldn't it?

100
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,685
You oughta go after
Big Tech.

101
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,787
I dozed off mid-emoji,

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,089
Roxanne grabbed the damn phone
and saw it all.

103
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:19,126
I'll just drop this here
while I test the beds,

104
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,128
pick out a room.

105
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,280
The thing about self-help is,

106
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,215
if you're getting it
from someone else it's not self,

107
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,584
and if you're doing it yourself,
you didn't really get help.

108
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,191
Carlin.

109
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,426
George Carlin. No?

110
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,961
Yeah. All-time great.

111
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,030
But not quite like Coach Wooden.

112
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:59,333
See, he wasn't an entertainer.

113
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,635
He understood life.

114
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,103
Codified what he learned,

115
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,871
taught it
to his basketball players,

116
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,206
made it available
to the rest of us.

117
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,576
As I am now making it
available to you.

118
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:11,278
"Initiative," "skill,"

119
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,749
it all seems kinda... basic.

120
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,984
Not ItsMeTinx basic.
Like what it used to mean.

121
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,819
I met him once,
when we won State's.

122
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,688
Fundamental, not basic.
It's different.

123
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,590
What'd he teach ya?

124
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,959
How to put on my socks
and shoes.

125
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,927
How to lace 'em up
and tie 'em right.

126
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,362
Know why?

127
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,597
Blisters?

128
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,931
To remember that
every season,

129
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,433
we start again
from the beginning.

130
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:36,037
We were champions
of this season. Not the next.

131
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,038
So we'd better do
everything right.

132
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,208
Plus, yeah, blisters.

133
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,444
Not self-help.

134
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,178
Help.

135
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,324
- Who's that?
- Beats me.

136
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,660
Ten bucks says
he doesn't have any blisters.

137
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,365
Remember, you're bowing
to the Buddha, not me.

138
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,133
Yes.

139
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,538
Daniel.

140
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,106
I'm ready.

141
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,412
Is that the first sign
of readiness, do we think?

142
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:54,014
Stating it.

143
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,917
Are you suggesting I'm
not ready to take refuge?

144
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,319
Because I have to.

145
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,756
I need to.

146
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,160
What's that?

147
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,194
Vegan ice cream.

148
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,330
A gift for you.
It's the best--

149
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,564
No.

150
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,099
What's that?

151
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,736
A gift for you,
as I said.

152
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,238
I made it myself.

153
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,672
For what purpose?

154
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,576
For... to, uh...

155
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,144
To curry favor.

156
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,615
The very sweetness
of the cream

157
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,283
is bitter in this way.

158
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,118
Do not buy friendship

159
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,319
or comfort.

160
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,959
Where I come from,

161
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,495
everything's a transaction.

162
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,497
Where you're going...

163
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,965
a commitment to the Buddha,

164
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,068
the Dharma, the Sangha,

165
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:52,105
the goal is to avoid
being transactional at all.

166
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,276
Can you do this?

167
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,977
Will you try?

168
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,548
I'll start with a month.
Go from there.

169
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:01,749
Start with a day.

170
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,851
When I decide something--

171
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,753
Start with an hour,
even a minute.

172
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,322
Then add a minute to that one.

173
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,060
That's the work.

174
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:17,131
We'll meet in four days,
see how it's going.

175
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,567
You're not sure
I can refrain from transacting

176
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,968
for four days?

177
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,104
Whether I'm sure
matters not at all.

178
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,807
Well, I am.

179
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,943
I'm sure.

180
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,881
All right, rack the bid,
get it done.

181
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,552
What's he,
the new golden boy?

182
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,688
Took Dollar Bill's slot.

183
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,224
Probably looking for the
actual dollar to steal too.

184
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,492
Coach Wooden always said,

185
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,495
"I treat my players fairly,
but not equally.

186
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,164
Depends on performance."

187
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,166
And that's what we are
evaluating now. Performance.

188
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,335
Evaluate and decide who starts,
who rides the pine--

189
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,637
And who gets
their scholarship pulled.

190
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,405
Now, I've always
believed you live in a house

191
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,907
before renovating,

192
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,243
so you don't sledgehammer
a support beam,

193
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,578
put a Barcalounger where
the bar should be.

194
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,414
Well, our grace period here
is coming to an end.

195
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:11,518
This Friday, I'm reallocating
capital at the firm.

196
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,820
If you change strategies,

197
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,655
if you stray
from the fundamentals,

198
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,323
I'll see it, so don't.

199
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,394
Position sizing,
focus, restraint--

200
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,164
consider them our
load-bearing walls.

201
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,666
And, uh, oh, yeah,
do your best.

202
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,701
For you.

203
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,470
To return to Coach Wooden,

204
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,038
"You're the only one who knows
whether you've won."

205
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,977
Pretty sure the guy
carving up our trading dollars

206
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,646
knows whether we've won.

207
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,749
Was he looking at me
when he said "Barcalounger?"

208
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,251
Listen up:
Quarter ends Friday.

209
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,687
If you fuck up,
it'll be locked in,

210
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,888
and you'll be locked out.

211
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,456
What if you fuck up?

212
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,525
Then wake the hell up
from your nightmare

213
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,094
'cause in this life,
I don't ever fuck up.

214
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:01,869
I know you don't want me here.

215
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,970
Got that right.

216
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,082
Book a room at the
Yale Club for my father.

217
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,317
Mr. Allard needs you.

218
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,022
Have you decided who gets
Sacker's office yet?

219
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,357
Bureau chiefs
have been eyeing it.

220
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,029
That's Graceland,
we're not touching it.

221
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,669
Good. I need ya.

222
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:36,937
No, you need Marie Kondo.

223
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,539
Jesus Christ.

224
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,375
You got Aaron Burr's
gun permit lost in here?

225
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,977
But let me guess,
you know where everything is,

226
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,511
down to the last carbon.

227
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,846
Nope. Not a clue.

228
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,549
Where are we on the prosecutions
Sacker left behind?

229
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,451
Flailing, Chuck.

230
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,553
I have to admit, I'm not
as savvy on the legal stuff

231
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,822
as certain other
aspects of the job.

232
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,724
Like this one.

233
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,393
Big seafood wholesaler.
Mislabeled half its product,

234
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,161
stuck people
with cheaper fish instead.

235
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,597
The seafood fraud case,
we need a win on that.

236
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,599
To stand with the consumers
who're being fleeced.

237
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,668
Well, we may need
a different opposing counsel.

238
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,537
Lady's a pit bull,
won't settle it out.

239
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,339
Even though
we got her dead to rights.

240
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,709
I see that you
did need me. Okay.

241
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,779
- I'll handle it.
- Good.

242
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,048
But that's not why I needed ya.

243
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,617
Last night, in a private
suite at the Garden,

244
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,553
a young woman walks up
to Governor Sweeney,

245
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,355
told him he's wrecking
the Empire State...

246
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,525
- Hmm.
- ...and not that nicely.

247
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,593
People heard it.

248
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,728
My sources tell me
it was Gail Prince.

249
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,831
- Mike Prince's--
- Oh, I know who she is.

250
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,466
Governor Sweeney
still doesn't.

251
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,505
Buffalo Bob finds that out,
he's gonna get ornery.

252
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,040
Page Six.
Call over there and--

253
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,741
That I know how to do.

254
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,043
This'll be sweet.

255
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,711
As a Coolatta
with extra syrup.

256
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,447
The Commission never awards
the Games to a place

257
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,382
it doesn't feel
completely welcome in.

258
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,583
So...

259
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:57,985
This should pretty much
lead to the end

260
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,652
of Mike Prince's Olympic bid.

261
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,664
Don't call my mom
till I can explain--

262
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,099
Mom already got the call.

263
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,537
Let's get
Kate Sacker in here.

264
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,539
First, I'd like to get
Philip Charyn out of here,

265
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,274
and understand how
he even got in.

266
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,909
It was no setup.
I looked at the resumes

267
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,610
the headhunter sent blind.

268
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,345
Who else has that
many degrees from Stanford,

269
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,449
and Yale and Chicago?
You knew.

270
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,584
You kept your nephew out of
the Prince Companies for years.

271
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,385
I win this round.

272
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,663
- Hey.
- Hey.

273
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,604
Philip is Scooter's
sister's kid.

274
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,073
Managed $300 million
in tech at his last firm.

275
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,808
Prince bought out his contract.

276
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,111
That means he'll get a big
hunk of our allocations.

277
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,846
And our comp.

278
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,915
Don Fanucci's nephew's
not touching my smock.

279
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,517
For the record,
offer me a basket

280
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,452
of fruit and veggies,
I'm taking it.

281
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,454
Keep up the bucket shop
bullshit and you'll need it.

282
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,290
Mike said no
changing strategies.

283
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,227
Too bad for you,
that means losing ones too.

284
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,230
Oh, no fucking way
I get bounced over you.

285
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:19,967
Guys, since "sincerity"
is the mortar

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,303
that holds the "team spirit"
and "loyalty" blocks together,

287
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,939
maybe we share information.

288
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,909
Best practices?

289
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,311
What is this Commie shit,
from Mao's Little Red Book?

290
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,947
It's from the pyramid.

291
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,448
On the fridge?

292
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,358
Biggest hurdle we're facing,
Governor Sweeney.

293
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,727
The International Commission
of Sport is shy,

294
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,395
won't go where it's not wanted.
Never does.

295
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,563
Which is why
you'll win him over

296
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,364
in the meeting
I've set for you.

297
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,202
Yeah, I work quick.

298
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,703
It's what you brought me in for.

299
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,372
I need to know what to
expect from Chuck Rhoades

300
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,275
by way of interference.

301
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,809
I could use
you on the floor.

302
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,611
To clarify reallocation.

303
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,080
- I was perfectly clear.
- As Baccarat crystal.

304
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,782
What I really need is a referee.

305
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,618
It's a captain's practice,
Wags. Work it out.

306
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,896
I thought
you were a vegan.

307
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,498
It's true what they say,
"Never work for your heroes."

308
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,644
Nope. All of it is vegan.
Flatware too.

309
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,580
Terravore, the plant-based
meat company,

310
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,081
just rolled up
six other vegan innovators.

311
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,883
We're buying in.

312
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,918
Um, the fork thing's
super cool, but Terravore's

313
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,054
kind of a big fat yawn
in the plant-based space.

314
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,057
India alone discards 120 billion
plastic utensils a year.

315
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,759
- The market potential's robust.
- The forks aren't.

316
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,761
Millet's pretty breakable,
so pricey to ship.

317
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,930
Everybody's allocation's
up for grabs.

318
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,967
This is the week to be
ruthlessly strategic.

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,401
Here's the strategy,

320
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,203
We calculate
the largest position

321
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,205
we can buy in Terravore,
then we buy it.

322
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,883
Governor thing
just got a lot harder.

323
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,419
New York Post says Gail
insulted him to his face.

324
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,021
Practically spit in it.

325
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,589
- My Gail?
- Sorry to say.

326
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,057
It's what I came to tell you.

327
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,459
Your meeting with him is off,

328
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,694
unless Gail plans to be
there to apologize

329
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,264
and then to publicly
recant to the paper.

330
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,599
Get him on the phone.

331
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,801
He's not going to
take my call, is he?

332
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,609
Gail, it's Dad.
Call me back.

333
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,811
- I'll reach her. Just, uh...
- She might take my call.

334
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,780
Not your job.

335
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,952
I just needed you to see me
on your call sheet today.

336
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:55,255
To know I'm with you,
regardless of who isn't.

337
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,291
"Rich Kid Schools Gov."

338
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,593
Prince family punchline.

339
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,195
Monologue jokes can't be
far fucking behind.

340
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,797
Allow me to suggest
the proper tonic...

341
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,868
a restorative
trip to Lake Placid.

342
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:12,072
And the state debt incurred
during those Games.

343
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,440
Why is she lashing out at me?

344
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,641
Maybe because
she actually--

345
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,209
just goin' out on
a limb here--

346
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,045
has a problem
with the governor.

347
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,679
At the exact moment I'm
wooing him for the Games?

348
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,883
I say hear her out.

349
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,819
She'd have to pick up
the phone for that.

350
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,288
I'm calling a family summit.
I need you to fly in

351
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,623
to help the
conversation flow and--

352
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,491
You need me
to help get Gail there,

353
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,626
that's what you need.

354
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,828
- Thank you. Yes.
- I can't.

355
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,664
I'm packing for a different
summit, Lizard Head Peak.

356
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,499
It's only a five-day window,
and not even you

357
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,168
can raise the temperature
by ten degrees.

358
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,437
Our daughter just jacked it up
by a lot more than that.

359
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,638
I need everyone there
so I can lower it.

360
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,709
She gets it from you, y'know.

361
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,510
Not cowed by power,
or anything, really.

362
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,546
I'm sending a plane.

363
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,281
You'll be on Lizard Head
before the anvil hits.

364
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,549
And if I drop
everything for you,

365
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,716
what does that say to the kids?

366
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:01,354
It says you're strong enough
not to stand on ceremony.

367
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,659
We're 5X in Terravore now.
And we were noisy.

368
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,294
The Street knows we're all-in.

369
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,862
Good. What about
the call options?

370
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,330
We're out of the money.
Like, way, way out.

371
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,665
$20 above current price.

372
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,467
- Also good.
- Why's it good?

373
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,202
These calls expire in weeks,

374
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,970
worthless if we don't hit
the target, which we won't.

375
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,172
Either you know
something we don't,

376
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,508
or you're shoving a wrench
into the gears as payback

377
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,211
for Prince gutting
the Africa Wi-Fi play.

378
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,612
My buy raised a red flag

379
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,314
because it's not
customary for me,

380
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,849
so you're here
to wag a finger.

381
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,617
But I'm comfortable
with my decision.

382
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,185
You can carry on
with your day.

383
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,687
Preempting me,

384
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,255
satisfying as it may be
for you,

385
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,524
doesn't change my warning.

386
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,093
There is no bumping
the pinball machine

387
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,762
at Michael Prince Capital.

388
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:42,896
Unh.

389
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,531
Don't do that.

390
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,899
But he's right.
You're trading this stock

391
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,934
as if you know something
you shouldn't.

392
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,836
And I won't be the only one
who sees this, which is why

393
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,571
he dragged me in here even
though I have better shit to do.

394
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,006
And if there is a bump.

395
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,674
Mnh.

396
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,843
It carries criminal penalties.

397
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,513
Not a bump or a nudge or
a kick to the coin box.

398
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,647
I believe in the company.

399
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,883
Then I believe
I'll be watching.

400
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,601
Less imposing than I expected.

401
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,170
That's the thing
about government offices.

402
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,172
The power comes from the man,
not the trappings.

403
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,441
What makes you think I'm
talking about the trappings?

404
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,679
Ms. Mahar,

405
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,681
- or may I call you Daevisha?
- Call me Dave.

406
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:35,849
It's good enough
for Starbucks--

407
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,784
Dave, you can drop
the posturing.

408
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,820
Your client's guilty,
of literal bait-and-switch.

409
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,656
I can assure you, what's
good enough for Starbucks

410
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,257
isn't good enough for
the people of this state.

411
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,293
They want their fish
called by their proper names.

412
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,894
Absolutely.

413
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,596
There's no light
between our positions.

414
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,232
Well, other than
the sweet burden of proof.

415
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,866
Which you bear.

416
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,304
You know, I read about you,
and I expected--

417
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,672
Someone subservient?

418
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,273
- No. A better person.
- Oh.

419
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,676
Former public defender,
first-generation American,

420
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,045
defending predatory rip-offs?

421
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,113
You left out a couple
of things on my resume.

422
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,582
Like Harvard Law, my Fulbright,

423
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,883
and the fact that
I've never lost a case.

424
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,719
Oh, I know.
I called around, too.

425
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,888
You used to be
a killer for our side.

426
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,090
Now you're like those guys
Erin Brockovich served water to.

427
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,960
Difference is,
I'd know she was bluffing,

428
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,662
and I'd drink it down.
Glug glug glug.

429
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,098
Well, the difference is,
I'm not bluffing.

430
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll be trying this case
if it goes to court.

431
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,468
No one else.

432
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,439
I have a mountain
of DNA evidence.

433
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:35,342
I'm Lancey Howard with the
jack of diamonds in his hand.

434
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,944
Then it's a good thing no one
plays five card stud anymore.

435
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,247
I'm twice as ready
as the Kid, anyway.

436
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,282
I'm stoked to go against you.

437
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,750
Excuse me?

438
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,318
Last prosecutor
of your vintage

439
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,853
who stepped into court,

440
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,722
ended up with hair dye
streaming down his face

441
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:52,058
like the tears
of the clown that he is.

442
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:08,074
Do I look that focused?

443
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,343
I am that focused,

444
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,912
I just don't look it.

445
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,752
New guy.

446
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,020
You chose the wrong desk.

447
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,054
Oh, is that so?

448
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,789
Yeah, we go by
Sharpe ratios here.

449
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,858
Highest performers
on the left.

450
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:25,992
Oh.

451
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,364
My risk-adjusted return,
I'm a 1.9.

452
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,566
So I could take yours.

453
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,100
But I was being polite.

454
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,904
What are we measuring next?

455
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,418
Patty of the week!

456
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,819
Mmm.

457
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,422
Good-looking chunk of chuck.

458
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,990
Blind tasting, here we go.

459
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,360
Mmm.

460
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:06,132
Nice bite and mouth-feel.

461
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:09,102
Good fat content
and bun-to-patty.

462
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:13,106
I like American cheese
on a burger, this is cheddar.

463
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,941
Medium juicy.

464
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:18,745
Rating is,
a strong buy.

465
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,413
Where's this from?

466
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,082
New place from
a graduate of Corner Bistro.

467
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,585
Nice.

468
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,687
Well, there you have it.

469
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,090
Sounded like he liked it.

470
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,992
The more he likes them,
the harder he throws them.

471
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,860
Another strong buy

472
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,328
for all my Russakoff's
Raiders out there:

473
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,696
ArpCom.

474
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,131
It is ready to rip!

475
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,974
Why would you watch him?

476
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,276
Even competent day traders
rarely make gains.

477
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,045
He is not competent.

478
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:56,516
Russakoff's the fucking man
to like millions of bros.

479
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,717
You're not one, though, so...

480
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,053
Not the man or not a bro?

481
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,821
If you were either,
you wouldn't ask.

482
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,457
He watches because
Russakoff moves the market

483
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,626
when he gets passionate.
It's a fact we don't like,

484
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,329
but a legit data point
nonetheless.

485
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:10,463
Now. Can we talk Terravore?

486
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,032
Our buy inched it up to $63.00.

487
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,199
Yay, team.

488
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,769
That's still
a far climb to $75.00.

489
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,270
The day traders just buy
what he tells them?

490
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,773
From the depths
of their man caves, they do.

491
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,274
And not just stonks.

492
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:24,677
He's a lifestyle brand
unto himself.

493
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,258
Made the kids dinner.

494
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,993
You're welcome.

495
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,429
You're supposed to be
at the Yale Club.

496
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,564
Times like this,
a man belongs

497
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,666
in the bosom of his family.

498
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,768
Grab yourself a lowball.

499
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,137
Everything we need
is right here.

500
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,575
Have you even
tried to call Roxanne?

501
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,577
Tendered an apology?

502
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,112
I called Judith

503
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,014
to be sure

504
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,316
that I hadn't
crossed any lines.

505
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,385
Well, having to check
is usually a great sign.

506
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:06,720
She assured me I hadn't.

507
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:08,722
One call down, one to go.

508
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,690
But we got to talking.

509
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,527
And the bons mots
were flying, Sonny,

510
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,931
like the Algonquin in '23.

511
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm thinking of acting
on our kinship,

512
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,535
of consummating it.

513
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,137
- She's game--
- Dad, no.

514
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:28,708
What happens when
this fling ends,

515
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,610
like all the others?

516
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:34,347
And you've bulldozed your
second home in as many years?

517
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,049
It's not like I haven't
thought this through.

518
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:40,219
There is a plan B.

519
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,575
Uh.

520
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,749
You texted
"Emergency with your dad."

521
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,085
He seems... fine.

522
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,254
I appreciate
like hell you showing up.

523
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,089
You gotta talk to him.
You're the only one who can.

524
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,794
Issue?

525
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,129
He's forgotten he's married.

526
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,565
No. No.

527
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:30,470
You work him through whatever
stage life crisis this is.

528
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,238
I help my guys at work.

529
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,841
Our kids. Maybe now
finally myself, if I can.

530
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:37,644
I came because
I thought "emergency"

531
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,279
meant something different.

532
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,747
Fine by me.

533
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,182
Never got to unpack.

534
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,022
He's living here now?

535
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,691
Ergo, the emergency.

536
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,827
You can go back to your...

537
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,394
ever-expanding empire.

538
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,732
I'm not gonna talk to you
about Kate Sacker, either.

539
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,801
I didn't say
a word about her.

540
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,503
Even though she was poached,

541
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,772
casus belli, a Cold War thrust
in the fucking broiler.

542
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,141
I don't owe you an apology,
if that's what you're--

543
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,443
Oh, no, I hold Prince
responsible for that, not you.

544
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,979
You just lured her
to his temple of greed.

545
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,781
It's not Axe Capital, Chuck.

546
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,249
It's worse.

547
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:18,351
Because it pretends
to be better.

548
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,886
She's very special.

549
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,822
And special to me.

550
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,024
Don't ruin her, Wendy.

551
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,833
Sweeney's hitting back.

552
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,870
He ordered a fresh audit of
the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics,

553
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:38,538
which went 320% over budget.

554
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,306
That's 'cause they were
run by resort town hacks.

555
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,975
State's still paying
the damn bills.

556
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,009
It's a low-grade stunt.

557
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,711
If Sweeney takes it public,

558
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:45,845
it'll scare off the Commission.

559
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,013
Our bid'll be finished.

560
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,214
If we were willing to consider

561
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,316
in a carefully-worded
statement,

562
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,751
putting some space between you
and your daughter on her--

563
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,086
We're unwilling.

564
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,354
I'm aware that
that option is no fun,

565
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,356
but if you paid me
to create fun,

566
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,258
I'd have replaced the stairs
with a water slide.

567
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,893
- I'm here to get you the Games--
- Do it another way.

568
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,835
Afraid we need
a little sit-down.

569
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,236
- What's the beef over?
- Gold.

570
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,871
- He's long, she's short.
- Details.

571
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,306
Not fucking tattling.

572
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,874
- We'll work it out.
- There, you see.

573
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,676
Before or after
your stupid position

574
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,411
costs the firm bags o' cash?

575
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:21,814
I meant we're gonna close out
your dumb fucking shorts

576
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,650
before gold soars.

577
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:26,285
This is when they need to go
to the principal's office.

578
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,923
I don't know enough yet
to weigh in on any of this.

579
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,758
And I'm not inclined
to do the work

580
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,926
to figure it out just now.

581
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,464
Can you give us the room?

582
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,268
Kate, you too.

583
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,807
One, Sacker's right
about that statement.

584
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,742
You should issue it.

585
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,978
Two, you don't know enough yet
to make a determination?

586
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,147
If this situation
with Gail is taking you--

587
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,482
Bonnie's short is 88%
negatively correlated,

588
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,985
Victor's calls
expire in six days,

589
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,320
three-and-a-half hours--

590
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:03,055
I'm the Eye of Sauron,
I see all.

591
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:07,026
But my communication
with my daughter has gone

592
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,762
from a trickle to dead silence.

593
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,631
The floor, the Commission,

594
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,099
that's the easy stuff.

595
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,045
In my, uh,

596
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,880
prior employment situation

597
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,615
with He Whom
I Shall Not Mention--

598
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,050
Good policy.

599
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,119
Yeah. With him
and the others there...

600
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,589
I could guide them

601
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,358
because there were
specific guard rails,

602
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:40,126
things you can or cannot
do from those offices.

603
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,795
Expectations. Limits.

604
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,464
Even when stretched,
you kind of knew the contours.

605
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,800
Hmm. Billionaires
are not public servants.

606
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,168
The levers are different.

607
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,104
Huh.

608
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,439
Does it ever get any easier,

609
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,274
seeing exactly what
they should do, and...

610
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,376
not being able
to get them to do it?

611
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:02,548
What'll happen is,

612
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,717
you'll just direct it
more and more inwardly

613
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,352
until you stop serving them.

614
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,188
When you're ready.

615
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:13,659
Or you'll get out
of it all entirely.

616
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,761
That what you're doing?

617
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,996
Me? No.

618
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm thinking about
incorporating all of it.

619
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,370
Synthesizing.
Letting go of results.

620
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,671
Breathing.

621
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,340
Ah, the Eastern approach.

622
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,608
Absolutely.

623
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:30,976
But the old habits.

624
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:35,080
- I have this guy--
- A guy?

625
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,351
No, not like that.
A priest. Buddhist.

626
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,686
He's helping me take refuge.

627
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,855
I tried to um, like...

628
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,158
bribe him.

629
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,260
I didn't even
realize I was doing it.

630
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,562
Shit. You get lost like that,

631
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,997
how's a naif like me
supposed to--

632
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,532
Oh, hardly.

633
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,834
You've been balancing
these equities,

634
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,069
the inner and the outer,

635
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,771
for most of your life.

636
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,773
I like the Bodhisattva way.

637
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,308
Don't worry about yourself.
Enlighten others.

638
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,944
That's my vibe. But, mmm...

639
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,347
not trying to hang onto it
as tight as it seems you are.

640
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,382
I'm definitely
not bribing any Brahman.

641
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,987
I imagine if you did,
they wouldn't see it coming.

642
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,363
- So?

643
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,399
Sweeney wants to meet with me.

644
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,868
About Mike Prince's Olympic bid.
Barely had to raise it.

645
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,204
Feels like we got a little
breeze at our backsides.

646
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:34,006
Or maybe it's
the Lake Placid windchill.

647
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,174
Where are we
on an expert witness

648
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,909
for my seafood fraud trial?

649
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,512
I've reached out to some
of the better fish DNA guys.

650
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:42,181
Not better. Best.

651
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:45,017
The testimony in this case
is everything.

652
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,953
Needs to be devastating.
Undeniable.

653
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,222
Best guy's named Bowen,
but he's not available.

654
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:52,291
Locked up in cases
with other prosecutors.

655
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,127
You sure Dave didn't
get him on their behalf?

656
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,828
Yeah. He's not
an industry guy.

657
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,130
He's state's expert.

658
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,165
No, I still smell Dave here.

659
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,800
She made sure
this Bowen was busy.

660
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,335
Shouldn't matter.

661
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:04,637
The other three experts
are raring to go.

662
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,172
This is Dave Mahar.

663
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,007
I'm sure of it.

664
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,276
She's trying to cut my damn
legs out from under me.

665
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,078
You get to this Bowen
and let him know,

666
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,646
he testifies in
this trial for us,

667
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,149
he gets me this win,
or he never gets

668
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:18,951
hired by any state again.

669
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,153
Why's this one matter so much?

670
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,122
She called me,
in so many words,

671
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,025
"A Giuliani-level hack."

672
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,361
That's Clubber Lang telling
Adrian he's more man than Rocky.

673
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:31,063
I have a moral
and professional obligation

674
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,565
to knock her
the fuck out now.

675
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,373
I'm gonna be flushed
with the bottom ten percent,

676
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,374
like G.E. did every year.

677
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,809
I'm gonna be G.E.'d.

678
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,711
Lot of people here.

679
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,648
Someone's gotta be
doing worse than you.

680
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,583
Okay, that didn't
come out the way I--

681
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,386
I'm gonna ask for less assets
under management.

682
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,421
If I'm smaller,
more concentrated,

683
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,423
I can carve a corridor
to a bigger profit share.

684
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,458
No. You never ask for less.

685
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,127
They'll think
something's wrong with you,

686
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,661
maybe even fire you
on principle.

687
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,732
I'm gonna be G.E.'d.

688
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:14,307
It says, "Use the threading wire
to pull it through,

689
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,042
then remove and discard it."

690
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:17,577
I already removed
and discarded it.

691
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,312
There was nothing
to pull through.

692
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,747
'Cause you removed
and discarded it!

693
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:26,618
Look, if ya came to play,
the tourney's been delayed.

694
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,739
I need your help on
a different kind of play.

695
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,307
A business play.

696
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:51,743
Why us?

697
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,446
Let me tell ya, bro.

698
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:00,820
I know exactly what you're
doing with Terravore.

699
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,355
Trying to pick a winner
in a fast-growing sector.

700
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:03,723
Trying to get it added.

701
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,424
To boost its price
and market cap by enough

702
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,560
that it's added to the S&P 500.

703
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,629
When it is, all the index funds
are forced to buy in,

704
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,597
that's the rule.
Which pumps the stock even more,

705
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,599
and you can dump it
before it cools.

706
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,901
Good read.

707
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,870
But, like I told you,
I believe in the company.

708
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:21,073
Without documentation,
it's market manipulation.

709
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,475
I prosecuted people for this.

710
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,577
You sound like Spyros.
Assertion without proof.

711
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,580
Here's what
the SEC's gonna ask:

712
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,815
"Where the fuck is your proof?"

713
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,919
♪ Here I am ♪

714
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:37,456
♪ On the road again... ♪

715
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,326
Biscuits and gravy.

716
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,262
Dad, I gotta throw
a flag on this one.

717
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,698
Illegal
emotional manipulation.

718
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,134
Totally unfair
to have to smell that

719
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,168
as we walk into the apartment.

720
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,770
Also, it's not gonna work.

721
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,538
Bob Seger's
a nice touch, though.

722
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:53,839
Reminds me of Sundays
when the kids were little.

723
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,776
What? You think
would plan this out?

724
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,278
I think you told your staff
to let you know the minute

725
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,814
we got in the elevator so
the chorus of "Turn the Page"

726
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,749
would hit exactly when we
walked into the kitchen.

727
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,852
Would I be the guy
you married if I hadn't?

728
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:10,256
I just so happened
to have a mix from Rosie's.

729
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,624
They sent over a care package.

730
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,459
After you sent
the plane for it, M-Tap?

731
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,594
I can't--
Yeah, who can remember?

732
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,330
The point is,
we're having some

733
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,465
homemade Indiana
biscuits and gravy.

734
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,434
Dad, we were summoned.

735
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,169
I mean, I'm not gonna
refuse the food

736
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:24,770
because we all know I'm not--

737
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,105
I am refusing.

738
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:28,040
I'm not breaking bread
with him at this point.

739
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,942
Yeah, honestly,

740
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,444
we're still pissed.

741
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,212
You don't get
to police our emotions.

742
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,814
Especially
about your bullshit.

743
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:38,718
I just told them to go
at it straight.

744
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,052
Good. Yes.

745
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:41,654
Let's get into it

746
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,489
Because I-I can't
live with things being

747
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,192
catawampus like this
between us anymore.

748
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:48,027
You're right. I was not

749
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,596
entirely forthright about
the cannabis company thing.

750
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,865
Forthright? So you're
a soft peddler now.

751
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,934
You'd rather I be
as direct as you were

752
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,369
with Governor Sweeney?

753
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:58,104
She was right to say
what she said.

754
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,373
She may have been, but it
doesn't mean she had to say it.

755
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:01,340
You're on his side?

756
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,542
I'm on all your sides.

757
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,544
There's... there's no sides.

758
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,346
I mean, there's--
there's one damn side.

759
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,482
I mean, Gail and I
are kind of a side,

760
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,516
and you're usually on it.

761
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,720
What your sister said put
a lot of pressure on your dad

762
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,022
when he's trying
to accomplish a difficult...

763
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,525
really hard... thing.

764
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,228
- It means a hell of a lot.
- To you and him.

765
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,697
Because if he locks this down,
you get a thing, too.

766
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,900
We all get a thing,
right, when I do well?

767
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,835
All the things.

768
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,904
That's the first time

769
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,106
you've ever said
anything like that.

770
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,376
We're all grownups here now,
aren't we?

771
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,445
So let's not
leave it unsaid.

772
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:42,715
You're both billionaires,
or you will be

773
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,950
partially because of all
the times I held my tongue

774
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:46,919
and didn't tell someone
what I actually thought.

775
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,788
You made more doing
the opposite.

776
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,589
The gift you've given us is,

777
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,991
Have no fear about
speaking our minds.

778
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:56,461
That's right.
Good.

779
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,999
But, uh,

780
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:02,334
sometimes, even though
we don't have

781
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,503
the traditional
things to lose,

782
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,704
we still have a lot to lose.

783
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:08,908
What are you
asking her to do?

784
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,743
Apologize.

785
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,111
Tell the governor you
didn't mean it. Tell him--

786
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,712
- Jesus Christ.
- Fuck that.

787
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,214
Girls!

788
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,582
I can't apologize for telling
the truth. I won't.

789
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:21,486
Then your dad'll
never make you.

790
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,624
I'll say I'm sorry, too,

791
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,827
for the way I handled
the business thing.

792
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,495
I should have brought
you inside it.

793
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,498
Still not going to do
what you want.

794
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,303
Okay.

795
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:38,904
I wish you would.

796
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,506
But... okay.

797
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:46,912
Will you at least start
answering my texts, then?

798
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,949
We'll put you back
on the family thread.

799
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,052
Oh, I-I'm already on
the family thread.

800
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:55,221
We might've, um,

801
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:58,157
already started a new one.

802
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,859
♪ There I go ♪

803
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,231
♪ There I ♪

804
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,866
♪ Go ♪

805
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,671
Now, Mr. Bowen,

806
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,740
as an expert witness,
you have testified

807
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:17,510
that the goods from
Ocean's Plenty Wholesalers

808
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:18,811
were not as claimed,

809
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,747
but rather cheap,
garbage fish,

810
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,116
mislabeled and pawned off
on an unwitting public.

811
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,618
I'm afraid so, yes.

812
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,386
In my expert opinion.

813
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,054
I object.
Leading question.

814
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,156
- Overruled.
- But, Judge--

815
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,958
Ms. Mahar, didn't you see

816
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,194
A Few Good Men
during law school?

817
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,196
You're about to get the judge
to reaffirm my guy's an expert.

818
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:40,566
Judge, I have something
to say about the bias--

819
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,967
You'll have your chance

820
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,669
to cross-examine
the expert witness.

821
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,738
Ah! See that?

822
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,506
And not only is he an expert,

823
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,674
he's a scientist

824
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,976
whose bias is the truth.

825
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:53,579
Something your client
the conglomerate

826
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:57,049
tried to hide
to rake in more profit.

827
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,851
Ocean's Plenty

828
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,886
trampled the rules
with abandon.

829
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,822
Duped customers day after day,

830
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,892
resulting in millions
in largesse.

831
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,562
No further questions.

832
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,900
Your moment's
arrived, counsel.

833
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,804
So, who paid you
to be here today?

834
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,806
The State of New York.

835
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,575
They hired me to gather all
the evidence in this case.

836
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:24,643
The State of New York.

837
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:25,978
Just laying out
the truth for the State.

838
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:29,214
Then, which do you prefer,
meat or fish?

839
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,384
Or grain? Or dairy?

840
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,087
Objection. Relevance.
We're not planning menus--

841
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,623
If there's a point,
counsel, get to it fast.

842
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:40,459
The point is bias.

843
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,428
If he loves meat
and hates fish...

844
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,396
it's hard to give a fishmonger
a break, isn't it?

845
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,899
Sure, I like meat.

846
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,469
I like fish too.

847
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:51,937
I like grain, bread,
whatever.

848
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,606
What does that
have to do with--

849
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:56,141
Permission to
approach the witness.

850
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,811
Recognize those?

851
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,579
You're under oath here.

852
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,981
- I'm aware of that--
- Good,

853
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:04,383
because if you are lying
about anything,

854
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,185
it's a class-D felony.
There are grave penalties for--

855
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:08,354
This is harassment,
if she doesn't have

856
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:09,955
an actual line of inquiry--

857
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,924
Protecting your witness
from perjury,

858
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,692
I'd say that's an actual--

859
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,394
The witness knows
the penalty for perjury.

860
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:18,297
He's not an idiot, and you're
not even making a defense.

861
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,932
Since we understand

862
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,234
the severe penalties
for perjury,

863
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,602
for you and your wife.

864
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,404
Those documents are
IRS Form 990s--

865
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,639
Okay. All right.

866
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,275
I'm biased.

867
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,145
For... whoever is paying.

868
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:34,646
Yes.

869
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,988
Enter defense exhibit
into evidence.

870
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,292
Multiple payments
for $50,000

871
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,961
made out to his wife,

872
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,864
from big beef,
big poultry, big dairy,

873
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,165
to hide the fact
that he'll say

874
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,867
whatever his paymaster
wants him to.

875
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,635
He's a paid gun for hire.

876
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,871
Today it's for the state,
tomorrow,

877
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,606
whoever's got the next check.

878
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,743
Sir, you have the right not
to incriminate yourself further.

879
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,912
That count as a defense to you?

880
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:23,028
You outplayed me.

881
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,864
Took a dirty
witness off the board

882
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,801
so I'd insist on having him.

883
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,636
Till he tainted all my evidence.

884
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:34,106
Like that lousy fish
you'd never eat.

885
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:37,810
You got that right.
Look at the bright side.

886
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:41,212
You got to log a few
hours in a courtroom.

887
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:56,428
Sorry for the drop-in.

888
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:59,264
I'll clear my schedule.

889
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,833
I need you to add to it.

890
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,835
A call with Governor Sweeney.

891
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,203
So I can apologize.

892
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,773
What made you
change your mind?

893
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:10,209
I mean, you knew it
would work on me.

894
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,444
You're my fucking father.
And a good one.

895
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,580
I curse like four times a year.
Why do you have to--

896
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:17,215
I went to college
out of state.

897
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:21,286
Just get the phone.
Let's call this guy.

898
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,959
Call the governor's office,
tell him

899
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,594
Gail wants to speak with him.

900
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:30,162
You know what you want to say?

901
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,163
Think it through,
don't freelance it.

902
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,068
So,

903
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,269
Mr. Sweeney-- Mr. Governor...

904
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,807
about what I said the other...

905
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:47,178
I'm so sorry for what
I said the other...

906
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:51,817
Mr. Governor,

907
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,152
regardless of my feelings,

908
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:55,220
out of respect for your office,

909
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,489
what I said the other
night was wrong,

910
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,224
and I am so sorry I--

911
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,925
Forget it.

912
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,464
You don't want me
to apologize?

913
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:07,933
I do want you to apologize.

914
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,102
I-I need you to, really.

915
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,805
But, uh... I raised you
to speak your mind.

916
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,507
- Fuck!

917
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,643
Five.

918
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,952
I'll tell you, Dad.

919
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,453
I will never understand

920
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,557
how a guy that
thin-skinned becomes governor.

921
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,626
Some kid gives him
a little crap,

922
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,295
and he lets it shape policy?

923
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,896
I mean...

924
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:41,032
the vanity is just
so over the top.

925
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,334
Good.

926
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,171
Yeah.

927
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,238
Real good.

928
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,910
Terravore's still
tickling $66.00.

929
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,482
This quarter's
gonna be a bloodbath.

930
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,253
I'm never gonna get
a sheet of my own.

931
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,124
Hang on.

932
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,226
Russakoff has a new post...

933
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,229
about Terravore.

934
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,335
Mmm.

935
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,170
Juicy, savory...

936
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:23,274
nice patty tension,
good bite--

937
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,345
this is a top pick,

938
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,880
outperform!

939
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:30,916
Thi-this is a must-buy
with leverage!

940
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,351
Where the hell did
you get this from?

941
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:35,087
It's Terravore.
100% vegan, plant-based.

942
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,922
You're fucking kidding me.

943
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:39,457
This is all
shoots and leaves?

944
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:43,929
Not the only way it's green.

945
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:45,764
Mase Carb's
yay deep in this name.

946
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,432
It's ready to hockey stick.

947
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,036
Nice, dude,
didn't even see you

948
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,538
swap out the meat
for the vegan shit.

949
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,074
I thought you were
gonna make the switch.

950
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:59,077
Raiders,

951
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,748
Terravore is ready to pull

952
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,516
a major stiffy!

953
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,351
Ohh!

954
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,526
Taylor.

955
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,195
Stock's surging
on message boards and Robinhood.

956
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,598
- The brosephs are biting!
- Taylor.

957
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:22,234
And once momentum gets going
with the retail crowd--

958
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,468
Taylor.

959
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,038
So you keep saying.
We should be happy.

960
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:30,074
We had to game it all out
from a burger review.

961
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:41,586
They say the finest
bespoke tailors

962
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,288
have "rock of eye."

963
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:46,658
Can see beyond pattern
and chalk

964
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:49,928
to take someone's true measure
by instinct, expertise.

965
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,296
You think that's
how I beat you?

966
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,165
No. It's how I see
beyond the woman

967
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:56,435
who stood up for
an indefensible seafood scam

968
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,971
to the better person
lurking beneath.

969
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:00,339
I served my client.

970
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:02,207
No higher calling
for a lawyer.

971
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,308
But your
professional background,

972
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,077
your choice of eatery,
tells me

973
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,746
you're not meant
to cut vicuna cloth

974
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,314
to pad your partners' paunches.

975
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:11,249
You're meant to fit
the real villains

976
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,285
for orange fucking jumpsuits.

977
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,354
So you came here
to yell at me.

978
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,055
I came here...

979
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:20,625
to hire you.

980
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,861
I did my 20 years as a PD

981
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:25,764
helping people with nothing
get their actual day in court.

982
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:27,666
I did.

983
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:30,836
But eventually I wanted
to come home to a place I owned,

984
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,338
not one I shared with a bank.

985
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:35,841
So you went white shoe.

986
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,209
It just became time
to get paid

987
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:38,543
commensurate
with my abilities.

988
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:42,047
Good.

989
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,883
Good, now
we're talking worth.

990
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,552
'Cause those seven figures
may convince you of yours

991
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:50,322
and it'll feel fucking great,
for a while.

992
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,424
But it's a mirage
and you know it.

993
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:57,029
The worth I can
offer is 200 times

994
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:59,197
the ski house that beckons

995
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,967
or the beach house
that follows that.

996
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,503
There's a war going on,

997
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:07,105
between the very wealth
you are trying to accrue

998
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:10,341
and the rest of us.
The stakes are absolute.

999
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:13,512
And we are under-armed
and under-manned,

1000
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,181
and you will be
the difference maker,

1001
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:19,384
which will make you
feel like yourself again.

1002
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:20,551
Finally.

1003
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,702
Good enough data to
divvy up the capital yet?

1004
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,571
Soon.

1005
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:41,873
Keep this going much longer,
they'll fuck the place up.

1006
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,442
Maybe.

1007
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:45,410
But this place
is also a platform

1008
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:48,380
for the bigger goals
we're chasing.

1009
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,882
Screw those up, might
as well not even be here.

1010
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,384
It all starts with the Games.

1011
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,586
Then we need to look
at ways to hit Sweeney,

1012
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:56,488
before he meets
with Rhoades tomorrow.

1013
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:59,591
Wags gave me a phone number
of a certain operative.

1014
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:02,427
Yeah, I don't think
an assassination,

1015
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,729
virtual or literal,
is the way to go here.

1016
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,199
No, I keep on thinking
about the vanity of a guy

1017
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,401
who would let a random
insult shape policy.

1018
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,002
Probably starts
every book he reads

1019
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:12,437
at the index,
under "Sweeney."

1020
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,741
Where are we on the naming
rights for the stadium?

1021
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,944
We're taking offers.

1022
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:20,111
Bidding's robust.

1023
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:23,448
Let's stop.

1024
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:31,089
Russakoff's Raiders
pushed it to 75,

1025
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,224
and the market cap
tipped it over the edge.

1026
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:33,725
S&P 500 just announced.

1027
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:35,961
Terravore joins
the index in two weeks.

1028
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:37,295
Good. Sell the news.

1029
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,964
Blow it out, all of it.

1030
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:40,765
You're not selling
those calls.

1031
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,834
- Or a single share of the stock.
- We're in the money.

1032
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:44,569
If I don't sell now,
they'll be worth nothing.

1033
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:46,438
If you do sell,
it's manipulation.

1034
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,340
I'm backing Spyros on this.

1035
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:49,608
You have a problem with it too?

1036
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,443
If an employee
courts prosecution,

1037
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,778
we're in HR territory,
so, yes.

1038
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,280
That won't be an issue.

1039
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,681
Legal's been in
on this from the start.

1040
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:57,682
I can paper this sale.

1041
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:01,453
What do you have
to support the buy?

1042
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,489
- My gut. My brain.
- That won't be good enough.

1043
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,598
What if it is a bump?

1044
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,634
And I want to be
the pinball fucking wizard,

1045
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,169
right up to the tilt line
without setting it off?

1046
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,607
Hmm.

1047
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,076
How long have you been vegan?

1048
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:26,544
Six and a half years.

1049
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:30,849
Well, that's six and a half
years of Instacart orders,

1050
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:33,385
Amazon deliveries,
web searches for vegan products

1051
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:35,520
that just became
due diligence.

1052
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:38,489
And it's all gonna go
in an analyst's report.

1053
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,567
For six and a half years now,

1054
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,735
Taylor has been meticulously
researching Terravore

1055
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:53,237
and the entire sector.

1056
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,740
I'll hang onto that

1057
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:57,608
in case the SEC calls.

1058
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:08,653
You know what happened here.
On my watch.

1059
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,622
Under my nose.

1060
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,525
I know
what I think happened.

1061
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,327
I also know,
no one can prove it.

1062
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:21,199
Blow it out.
Sell all of it.

1063
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,310
This isn't what
we talked about.

1064
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:35,546
I'm an attorney Wendy,
not a monk.

1065
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:37,582
Neither are you.

1066
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:58,536
You think I'd be here
if I didn't look up to you?

1067
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:01,406
- You looked past me to Prince.
- He gets me.

1068
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,141
He thinks you're
his Rocking-Horse Winner.

1069
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:04,309
Yeah, well,
that guy never missed.

1070
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:05,410
Until it killed him.

1071
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,511
It's just an old story.

1072
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,851
I could have been a conductor,
you know. For real.

1073
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:15,120
Even at a young age,
I could hear when an orchestra

1074
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:16,521
was really firing.

1075
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,590
When the oboist was hungover

1076
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:22,394
or second chair violin
was getting over a heartache.

1077
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:23,595
Couldn't pay for a ticket,

1078
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,697
so I would go
when the Phil

1079
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,432
piped the music out
into Lincoln Center.

1080
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,800
Even though it was noisy
as hell outside...

1081
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,738
I could hear it all.

1082
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:37,942
But in the end, I chose money.
Simple as that.

1083
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,211
I met Prince, saw where
we could go together,

1084
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:41,980
walked away from it.

1085
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:43,448
So buy yourself an orchestra.
You can afford one now.

1086
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,383
Yeah, sure. But I won't,

1087
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:48,119
because I'm a realist.

1088
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,855
What I'm telling you is,

1089
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:54,592
Don't sell your private dreams
short for the more common one.

1090
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,294
What if they're
one and the same?

1091
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,929
Then you wouldn't have been
teaching in that charter school.

1092
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:00,198
You can be more than
a rich guy at a fund.

1093
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,000
You can be a founder,
an operator.

1094
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:05,637
- Change the world.
- I know, Senator Corleone.

1095
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,406
- Governor Corleone.
- Yes. Exactly.

1096
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:13,311
If you could only see
yourself through my eyes...

1097
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:17,148
you'd know it's all possible.

1098
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,551
Ain't that the human condition.

1099
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,686
'Cause all I want
is to be here.

1100
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,556
And I want you
to want me here, I do.

1101
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:27,925
But if you don't...
I'll be here anyway.

1102
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,867
My dad sold insurance.

1103
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:39,371
He always told me,

1104
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:41,706
"Control what you can,

1105
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,874
take out a policy on the rest."

1106
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,445
Get a load of that.

1107
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,452
The real version will be up
at the opening ceremony in '28.

1108
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,421
If you help me get there.

1109
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:01,992
Well, uh...

1110
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:04,496
why would I ever do that?

1111
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,898
Because legacies are tricky.

1112
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:08,566
You know, history
controls them, not us.

1113
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,402
Yeah, well, mine's
going to be tainted

1114
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:12,003
by what your daughter said.

1115
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:15,373
- Newspapers already wrote that--
- Newspapers.

1116
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,676
They call 'em "history's
first rough draft" for a reason.

1117
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,512
Same reason the Irish
took 'em into the jacks

1118
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:22,747
before toilet paper.

1119
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,517
That's why I'm offering you
an insurance policy

1120
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,585
on your own history.

1121
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:35,593
Sweeney was supposed to be
here 30 minutes ago.

1122
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,061
Where the hell is he?

1123
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,462
The meeting's off.

1124
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:41,900
The governor's
throwing in with Prince.

1125
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,968
He's supporting
the New York Games.

1126
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,836
Jeez Louise.

1127
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,746
I took my own measure today.

1128
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,948
Rock of eye. And I'm here
to get what I'm worth.

1129
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:06,924
This woman, Judith...

1130
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:09,928
she was on
my bucket list since

1131
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:13,798
before either of us
had even remarried.

1132
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:16,434
Yet here you are at Chuck's,
not acting on it.

1133
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,270
Just waiting.

1134
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,440
And you're here to explain
why this restraint is good,

1135
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,909
why this is change.

1136
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,110
Nope.

1137
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:30,448
B.F. Skinner said
free will is an illusion;

1138
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,183
all we really have
is conditioning behavior

1139
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:33,718
and its consequences.

1140
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:36,654
And even the worst behavior,
followed by

1141
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:39,657
pleasant consequences,
is bound to be repeated.

1142
00:52:40,925 --> 00:52:43,060
I've thought about
that a lot this week.

1143
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:47,365
So... I need
to condition myself.

1144
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,834
For the good.

1145
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,569
No. It's why
you can't change.

1146
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:56,707
You've only been rewarded
for bad behavior so...

1147
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:00,578
you need to stay
the hell away from Roxanne.

1148
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:02,980
Stay away?

1149
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:07,018
For her sake.

1150
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:11,289
'Cause you're only gonna cheat
or fuck it up in some way.

1151
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:13,691
And she's only gonna suffer.

1152
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:31,175
He made up with her. He's
packing his bags to go home.

1153
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,711
How'd you do it?

1154
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,880
I urged him to stay away.

1155
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:37,415
Naturally.

1156
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:40,618
I knew you were
gonna come back.

1157
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:43,121
The week I've had, I...

1158
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:45,223
I wanted to help
where I actually could.

1159
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:47,959
Oh, please. You owed me one
after poaching Sacker.

1160
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:51,128
- Not the way I saw it.
- Uh-huh.

1161
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:56,567
Thank you anyway,
for hauling him outta here.

1162
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:25,063
Daniel, I need to cancel
our meeting tonight.

1163
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:28,299
I couldn't go the four days
without being transactional.

1164
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:30,901
I couldn't go four hours.

1165
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:33,805
I'm gonna start over.

1166
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:35,639
Call you when I get there.

1167
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,822
Sometimes you cut
someone's minutes

1168
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:52,590
to remind them of their job.

1169
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,459
Sometimes you sit down a starter

1170
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:56,628
so they stand up stronger.

1171
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:58,696
Wooden. Again.

1172
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,800
Now, no one's being fired.

1173
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:06,237
This isn't Jack Welch's G.E.

1174
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:10,875
But too many of you were thrown
off your games too easily,

1175
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:13,044
so not all of you are
gonna keep their minutes.

1176
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:14,979
Victor, you'll keep
all of yours.

1177
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:16,781
You showed full exertion
and total focus,

1178
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,249
even in a petty squabble.

1179
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,351
But Philip's gonna
clean up your book,

1180
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:23,788
make it worthy of
the fund that bears my name.

1181
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:26,157
Thanks, Mike.
You won't regret it.

1182
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,193
Bonnie, I'm cutting
your book in half.

1183
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:30,795
You traded against others
instead of for yourself,

1184
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,664
and your call was off.

1185
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:35,199
Wags'll approve all your trades
until I think you're ready.

1186
00:55:41,072 --> 00:55:42,740
Fuck that.

1187
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:49,146
If I wanted team spirit, I would
work for fucking Chick-fil-A.

1188
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,202
Where's mine?

1189
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:17,175
Philip, I'm doubling the book
you had at your old place.

1190
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,343
Thanks, Mike,
but I'd like it to be halved.

1191
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,146
I'll grow my own book
if I can carve more profit.

1192
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,648
Fine.

1193
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,049
Nice. I like it.

1194
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:27,085
We'll discuss terms privately.

1195
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:29,721
I fucking knew it!
You told me not to!

1196
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:30,922
I'm so sorry.

1197
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:32,056
Tuk, I'm zeroing you out.

1198
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:34,058
You'll service Philip for now.

1199
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,527
He'll teach you to trade
from fearlessness, not fear.

1200
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,229
Ben, I'm boosting you 10%.

1201
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:41,399
Keep making the bold plays,
but unwind the protection.

1202
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:43,434
Lose the training wheels, man.
You don't need 'em.

1203
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,170
Taylor Mason Carbon, you'll keep
your full allocation.

1204
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:49,240
I welcome your
new sense of... mission,

1205
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:51,775
as long as it never
conflicts with mine.

1206
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,278
Their shit worked.

1207
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,713
It worked, all right.

1208
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,248
Thirty million-plus
on that trade.

1209
00:56:57,281 --> 00:57:01,319
Taylor went Milken
in '85, and it worked.

1210
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:02,854
Fucking rapacious.

1211
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,156
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
not so fast.

1212
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:07,725
I know this can be
an all-star team,

1213
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,660
but you can play
way above the rim.

1214
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:12,363
But you'll never get there
with blisters on your feet.

1215
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:15,666
That's why I keep hammering you
on the fundamentals.

1216
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:18,769
Position sizing,
focus, restraint.

1217
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:26,244
And, for all your moves,
for all your talent,

1218
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:27,945
it looks like Axe never
taught you how to put on

1219
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:29,347
