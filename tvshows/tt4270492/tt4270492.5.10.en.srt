1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:06,256
It's been hard to watch
the world celebrate this man

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,675
and know the truth of
what he did to my son.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,844
Which is steal from
him and destroy him.

4
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,971
I need a list
of all the companies

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,681
who don't deserve to
be collateral damage

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,849
to my mistakes.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,184
-So you can?
-Free them.

8
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,520
He's selling just to sell
which means we can buy it all.

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,022
Prince is
done. He's bled out.

10
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,024
He's not dead until
I say he's dead.

11
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,984
A month from now,
these hospitals

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,361
they're going to be over run
with that damn Chinese bug.

13
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,696
How's our painter doing?

14
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,864
He's got collectors

15
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,157
and commissions in his head.

16
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,867
I could take some pressure off.

17
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:37,037
Axe used his black magic to
get my commission squashed.

18
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,414
Did you know Axe
was gonna do this?

19
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,833
In case you're still not sure
when something's finished...

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,043
this fucking is.

21
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,837
Every company you sold off today

22
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,255
will likely fold.

23
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,548
You didn't know?

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,883
Bobby Axelrod has to be

25
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,052
wiped off the face of the Earth.

26
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,220
Axe has a new toy,
a bank.

27
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,306
And the bank requires a trustee.

28
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,726
I could yank his puppet strings.

29
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,687
Now you get to live and
be my man on the inside.

30
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,190
Well it may not work
out the way you think.

31
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,649
Wait a minute.
You're the donor?

32
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,193
Senior's not our man anymore.

33
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,527
I'm the bait,

34
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,571
and the bank is the trap.

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,243
How are we taking
down Bobby Axelrod?

36

Welcome back.

38
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,604
You too.

39
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,954
He's really fucking
hangin' that thing?

40
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,290
They hung it. He told me where,
I pointed.

41
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,459
Freshen up the look in
honor of being back in person.

42
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,961
It's not a real painting.

43
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,963
Is if Axe says it is.

44
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,966
That's a great thing
about abstract art;

45
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,676
who knows what Tanner intended?

46
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,053
I do.

47
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,763
And what he intended
was to smash it all--

48
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,473
If it upsets you,

49
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,642
take it up with He Most Exalted.

50
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,496
Hey, Wags said you were upset.

51
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,165
Why'd you do it?

52
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,000
Well,
I own the paintings and the wall so--

53
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,543
Come on, Bobby,
you know what I'm asking.

54
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,503
Why'd you fuck him up like that?

55
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,005
Ruin him.

56
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,798
He's not ruined.

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,300
This whole thing is gonna
make the critics love him.

58
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,010
You got him out of
my life pretty quick

59
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,928
is all I'm saying,
and not by accident.

60
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,763
No part of that is true.

61
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,307
Not even close to it.

62
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,434
Remember this,
he was in my life first.

63
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,436
It was your job to keep
him there productively.

64
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,521
You fucked that up, not me.

65
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,106
That painting,

66
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,858
it's all I have to show for it.

67
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,359
If one of us should be asking
hard questions of the other,

68
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,360
it's me.

69
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,033
Hey, stay by your phone.

70
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,369
I... I need you.

71
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,706
For after that thing, you know?

72
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,875
To talk 'em down.

73
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,794
I don't ever wanna die

74
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,589
I wanna hear the angels sing

75
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,383
I wanna give every dime I own

76
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,595
And I want all the gold for me

77
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,847
I want everything

78
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,267
I want everything...

79
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,455
The market's been
like the Spanish Boot.

80
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,415
You know,
like during the Inquisition,

81
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,918
when they cased
your legs in iron spikes

82
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,419
until they crushed your shins?

83
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,380
Yeah,
except it's not just the legs.

84
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,381
Iron Maiden.

85
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,216
"Number of the Beast."

86
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,551
Absolutely what this
whole thing feels like,

87
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,762
whole pandemic. Devil's work.

88
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,055
No. The torture implement.

89
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,391
Like the boot, but full body.

90
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,268
With all this volatility,
drawing and quartering

91
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,894
would be most appropriate.

92
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,521
And at least they
hung you first.

93
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,857
They hung you second.
They dragged you first.

94
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,567
Behind a horse.

95
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,403
Then they hung you.

96
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,404
Then they quartered you.

97
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,863
Jeez.

98
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,449
Attention please!

99
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,326
Don't try to slink
away just yet.

100
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,370
We have an announcement.

101
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,166
So first of all,
if you have been vaccinated,

102
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,835
take off your mask.

103
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,006
I just got back
some lab results,

104
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,633
and the rapid test
you all take downstairs,

105
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,510
it's not the one most folks get,

106
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,721
and it's 99.6% effective.

107
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,514
So if you're at Axe Cap,

108
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,850
you are not transmitting
any viral load.

109
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,601
Where are you?

110
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,103
I'm in quarantine.

111
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,147
Day before I was
due to get my shot,

112
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,900
I tested positive for COVID.
My fuckin' pilot gave it to me.

113
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,570
So those of you
with your masks off,

114
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,238
we've vaxxed ya'.

115
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,657
As many as we could
find loopholes for.

116
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,659
If we didn't vax ya' yet,

117
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,954
well,
let me just say this to all of you:

118
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,332
It's been inspiring as hell

119
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,833
watching you all
battle on during

120
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,668
the worst of the pandemic.

121
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,503
Inspiring commitment.

122
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,005
Just the same,

123
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,173
you're all fired.

124
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,633
Every last one of you.

125
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,510
Axe Cap is closed.

126
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,391
Now, most of you

127
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,394
will be hired back again
by the end of tonight,

128
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,021
by the new Axe Holding Company

129
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,564
under either the Axe Bank

130
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,858
or the Axe Asset
Management Division.

131
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,778
Our new structure will be in
place by the end of the weekend

132
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,237
so we're open for
business Monday.

133
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,990
You said "most" will be rehired?

134
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,617
Good listening.

135
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,410
That's right, Ben Kim, like you.

136
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,704
But not like....

137
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,584
Now Wendy is
gonna be in her office

138
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,627
getting ready to discuss

139
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,753
all of this with you

140
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,213
at the exit interviews.

141
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,173
The world has changed.

142
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,300
We have to change.

143
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:28,137
-This way.
-We have already changed.

144
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,723
Lauren,
you're gonna have to choose between

145
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,351
Axe Bank and Mase Carbon.

146
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,561
You got until the end
of the night to decide.

147
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,081
First priority,

148
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,582
form an emergency
capital introduction

149
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,251
and raise team for the bank.

150
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,211
We need some fuckin' deposits.

151
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,338
And more than just
stimulus checks.

152
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,548
Before there's none left,

153
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,800
and our bank dies in the crib.

154
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,802
Seemed so easy before.

155
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,345
Yeah, well, the fucking Goliaths

156
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,763
have gobbled it all up.

157
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,265
So find me mine.

158
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,647
Psychiatrists will tell you
reassurance does no good,

159
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,858
because once reassured,
you are not becalmed for long.

160
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,943
Instead, you become trained
to need more reassurance.

161
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,070
Yeah. But I still
look in the mirror

162
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,321
to make sure my butt is...

163
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,823
You could just ask...

164
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,950
...somebody.

165
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,035
-I'd--
- Fine.

166
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,371
I'll take this moment to
set your minds at ease.

167
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,956
No matter what the
mothership does,

168
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,125
we at Taylor Mason Carbon
will remain autonomous.

169
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,460
You will not be
working for a bank.

170
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,961
All will be resolved.

171
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,463
What about her?

172
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,466
You-- I mean Lauren.

173
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,551
I didn't mean to
just reference you.

174
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,052
You're right there
so--

175
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,762
We all need to stay
focused and united.

176
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,306
Loyalty is doubly important now.

177
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,974
So Lauren isn't
going to the bank.

178
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,643
She'll stay in IR at the
new asset management arm

179
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,103
and stay in place for us.

180
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,660
Hard Bob?

181
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,496
'Lo, Axe.

182
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,665
When last we spoke,
you'd tendered me a position.

183
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,627
Well,
now that I find myself at loose ends,

184
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,670
I was of a mind to claim it.

185
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,547
They bounced you
out of the government

186
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,216
because of your
connection to Krakow?

187
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,676
They did indeed.

188
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,220
But during quarantine,

189
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,222
I became aware of
your new endeavor.

190
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,015
So I've boned up

191
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,267
on all the latest changes
to the banking laws

192
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,269
on the off chance you
need someone to be

193
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,438
your banking compliance honcho.

194
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,360
Well, get over to our office

195
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,904
and get started with my CEO.

196
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,281
You got it, Axe.

197
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,587
You two seem banky.

198
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,005
You feelin' banky?

199
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,424
This is... is this trolling?

200
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,009
Are you trolling us?

201
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,053
He's seeing what we're made of.

202
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,806
That I am. And you are
made of the stuff of Fort Knox.

203
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,934
Stand by. Assignment's coming
directly from the high chief.

204
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,356
You wanted a reminder;

205
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,358
you have a date with a
Chelsea tonight. 8:00 p.m.

206
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,277
Oh, shit!

207
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,820
I forgot.

208
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,863
No way I can
leave the office now.

209
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,532
This one is important.

210
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,617
I thought the last one was,
but this is crucial.

211
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,452
Take dictation.

212
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,414
Oh, you mean me?

213
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,541
I thought you were
gonna enable Siri.

214
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,668
Just a type a text
to Chelz for me.

215
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,927
The sequel to   The Hustler.

216
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,345
Color of Money.

217
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,180
Yes. One of my
roommates from Williams

218
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,266
kept watching it
over and over again.

219
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,851
And I asked him why.

220
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,603
And he said it was
because of the way

221
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,938
the power dynamics
kept switching.

222
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,065
And he never knew
who was zooming who.

223
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,443
Hmm. My college roommates
were mostly just trying

224
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,069
to make one of
those beer harnesses

225
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,779
-you put around your head--
-Yeah, jocks, yes.

226
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,781
But it's the "Who's
zooming whom" part.

227
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,325
That means
something different now.

228
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,909
But you want me to be eyes up.

229
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,453
I need you to be.

230
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,122
Especially in that
company at that dinner.

231
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,582
And not just at the dinner.

232
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,626
Then that's where they'll be.

233
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,627
Up.

234
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,808
No, no,
no, don't do that

235
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,934
with your fingers, like that.

236
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,144
No, you forget germs?

237
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,313
I've earned this carrot.

238
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,857
Believe me,
you're gonna give me all the carrots.

239
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,069
Ah-ha, you have news.

240
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,238
Signed NDAs.

241
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,907
We got the offer.

242
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,575
And it's a sweet one.

243
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,327
Suh-weet.

244
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,995
Wendy didn't undersell
the value of her shares

245
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,330
to Taylor Mason Carbon.

246
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,415
Very fair, more than fair.

247
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,292
And she's ready to
strike a payment plan

248
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,794
and write out a check ASAP

249
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,462
to finalize the
divorce settlement.

250
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,339
That's no Cinnabon.

251
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,008
That's a sour cream
sandwich and I'm not biting.

252
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,343
Don't tell me you're
balking at the idea

253
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,844
of her paying you alimony?

254
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,305
I thought we were
well past you realizing

255
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,682
your worth isn't just
measured in dollars.

256
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,225
No, no, no gallantry.

257
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,851
I am past that quaint idea.

258
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,395
What I want is leverage.

259
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,188
To do my own valuation
of Mase Carbon.

260
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,398
Use the offer to get me that.

261
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,817
You wanna look at their books.

262
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,819
I want to crawl into them
with my prospector's light.

263
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,529
And, uh,  yeah, well,

264
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,864
I don't wanna
call it a full audit.

265
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,825
Let's just see how
they're cookin' 'em.

266
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,702
It ain't good for you, brother.

267
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,162
You keep at this,
you're gonna pull an embolism

268
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,249
or send your blood pressure
into Alice Kramden territory,

269
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,377
to the moon. Don't do this.

270
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,045
I say as your lawyer
and best friend.

271
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,715
I hear you and I understand.

272
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,050
And at a rational level,
I agree.

273
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,720
And thank you with an
open heart and mind.

274
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,306
But also my open
mind knows this:

275
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,142
you've already got that demand

276
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,894
for financial
disclosure drawn up

277
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,563
to get me the access
I just asked for.

278
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,564
Don't you?

279
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,899
I know my man. Yeah.

280
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,568
Doesn't mean I think it's right.

281
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,195
Send the damn disclosure.

282
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,574
And then I'll grab you a
big plate of those carrots.

283
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,964
I signed for this.

284
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,049
I didn't realize what
it was when I did.

285
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,603
Son of a bitch.

286
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,772
You got unplowed fields for me?

287
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,607
The wheat's a bit thin, but yes.

288
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,650
We look to whence
the bank comes from.

289
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,360
Go back to check
cashing and payday loans

290
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,945
that the original
company was built on.

291
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,238
Not recommended.

292
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,907
Seems a little low-rent.

293
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,867
So are the margins.

294
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,619
But then there's frontier
Rapid Growth Markets--

295
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,454
Vietnam, Nigeria, Indonesia.

296
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,623
Lots of money in places like
that looking for a safe home.

297
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,124
I like RGMs.

298
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,709
But what am I supposed to do?

299
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,711
Put our people on planes
and on video conferences

300
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,464
and start negotiations
with economic ministers?

301
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,467
That's a six months
to a year horizon.

302
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,552
There is cannabis money.

303
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,804
Hmm.

304
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,889
Yes.

305
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,808
It's a multi-billion
dollar space

306
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,477
according to our estimates,
as companies in medical marijuana

307
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,978
are ready to expand
into recreational

308
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,980
as it gets legalized
state by state.

309
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,982
Traditional banks
have been reluctant

310
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,609
to take on and
process this cash.

311
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,529
Sure, sure. I think I love this.

312
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,613
It's got potential.
Unfortunately,

313
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,948
it's a yellow light.

314
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,825
A great opportunity,
but not safe yet

315
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,202
until such time as federal
legislation changes.

316
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,704
It wasn't even supposed to
be mentioned in this meeting.

317
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,164
Yeah, but you did.

318
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,707
Send me everything
you have on it.

319
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,389
Mr. Prince,

320
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,058
I am pleased
that my invitation--

321
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,476
This is an impressive group.

322
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,603
I hope the intention
is as serious

323
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,147
as I was led to believe,
Mr. Rhoades.

324
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,358
Serious and elevating, I trust.

325
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,318
And, uh, call me Chuck, please.

326
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,695
And you call me Mike.

327
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,946
All of you.

328
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,199
Well, welcome to my home, Mike.

329
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,326
And to this chapter

330
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,370
of a great tradition,

331
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,539
the Jeffersonian dinner.

332
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,876
A further evolution of it anyway,
aided by WebEx.

333
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,212
Though separated
by circumstance,

334
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,841
there's no reason our
exchange of ideas has to be-- Ah!

335
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,093
And we will dine

336
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,928
as the founders did,

337
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,722
with heritage birds.

338
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,224
Has the same unaltered
genetic makeup as the turkeys

339
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,436
that roam the Shenandoah
Valley in Long Tom's day,

340
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,355
as my remote emissaries
have set up for you.

341
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,357
Yes, thank you very much.

342
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,568
I'm surprised you're not in
a powdered wig and tricorn.

343
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,528
Don't think he
didn't consider it.

344
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,324
We will honor this custom
going back to the days

345
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,659
of the founders
when leading citizens,

346
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,370
both public and private,

347
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,291
reviewed and sometimes
set the agenda of the day.

348
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,252
This will be a "one
mind" conversation

349
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,921
with everyone taking turns,

350
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,882
no real interlocution or
crosstalk except by me.

351
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,884
I will be our guide.

352
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,261
And tonight's topic is...

353
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,764
Liberty.

354
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,780
           -Liberty, law.
          -

355
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,412
Big words to unpack.

356
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,539
Either could be a
night's work. A week's.

357
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,375
It's like trying to understand
the difference in tone

358
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,085
between   Match Game   and Match Game,
PM.

359
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,586
-Well, the key there was

360
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,630
which ascot Charles
Nelson Reilly wore,

361
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,298
but this is not the
time to look into that

362
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,299
or the question.

363
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,969
Again, no cross talk.

364
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,846
Um,
and we will keep to Chatham House rule.

365
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,808
So, uh,
you can use any info you glean here,

366
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,184
but not for attribution.

367
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,269
Can I get a nod
of assent to same?

368
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,022
-   Of course.

369
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,525
Uh, premise.

370
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,151
-Two ways...
-I tried him, but

371
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,404
you're the one who
sent me this garbage.

372
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:32,783
...uh,
banking laws are a threat to liberty or

373
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,661
banks without regulation
are the true threat to liberty.

374
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,664
First,
are we a people at liberty?

375
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,833
Then, are we free to bank

376
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,960
-how we want?
- Right, yeah.

377
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,586
I have some thoughts on this.

378
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,630
Um, freedom...

379
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,465
Chuck, you need to take this.

380
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,342
Let's start with the,
uh, premise that--

381
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,302
It's a reflex. She calls,
I have to answer. It's Wendy.

382
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,599
We need to talk.

383
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,853
-Can't it wait?
-You didn't.

384
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,356
Uh, folks,
I'll need a moment before

385
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,191
we continue our colloquy.

386
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,821
I'm in the midst of a
Jeffersonian dinner.

387
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,115
You hit me with a
goddamn subpoena.

388
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,491
A demand for disclosure

389
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,076
as is within my rights.

390
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,745
I care not a whit,
as you might put it.

391
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,496
What I   do   care about
is what are you trying

392
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,914
to get out of this
look under the hood?

393
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,709
Fair play.

394
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,794
Getting what I am
owed. Simple as that.

395
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,838
We had an independent
valuator come up with that number.

396
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,715
Our very own Jonathan Mardukas.

397
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,550
Who knows what kind of circles

398
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,510
your in-house
accountant spun him in?

399
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,512
No. This is about control

400
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,222
over me one last time.

401
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,224
Or is it part of your
endless pursuit of Axe?

402
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,559
-Hmm.
-What, you want a Trojan Horse

403
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,810
into his books?

404
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,979
No plan. Do you want to be done?

405
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,564
Then let's be done. Pay me off.

406
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,358
Lump sum in the next 48 hours.

407
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,402
Forty-eight hours?

408
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,488
For that kind of money?

409
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,990
Or I'll be in first thing
next week to take a gander.

410
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,825
Or a perusal.

411
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,285
Or maybe I'll just take a
piece of the company. Hmm?

412
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,995
There's no way that's happening.

413
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,538
These are reasonable options.

414
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,123
It's either the Burt
Reynolds Spreader

415
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,792
or a go-away pay off.

416
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,710
The divorce judge
will see that as fair.

417
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,462
Because it is.

418
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,101
Hi.

419
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,144
Chelz, welcome.

420
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm so glad you're
here. Come with me.

421
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,700
I'm sorry I couldn't get away,
but...

422
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,202
I didn't wanna cancel.

423
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,121
More like you're
worried people my age

424
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,539
have a short attention span

425
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,415
and I would forget about you,

426
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,126
if you canceled.

427
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,670
But don't stress.
You've got my attention.

428
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,464
At least for now.

429
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,051
Is this weird?

430
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,469
I hope it's not weird.

431
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,472
It's a little weird.

432
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,474
Cheers.

433
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,726
Cheers.

434
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,645
I need you to go after gold,

435
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,605
gold deposits that is.

436
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,942
We get credits for
FDIC-insured deposits.

437
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,945
But there's a limit
of 250K per account.

438
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,072
So I need you to call
everybody on the master list

439
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,116
who's got more than that

440
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,618
and make 'em break down their
accounts into multiple accounts

441
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,412
of under 250.

442
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,955
Put 'em in their wives' names,
kids' names,

443
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,374
businesses, LLCs, corps.

444
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,585
That sounds...

445
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,086
well, I'll just say it.

446
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,838
Over the line.

447
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,425
In our world,
you're either driven by greed or fear.

448
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,843
If you picked fear,

449
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,802
I don't know why you're even in

450
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,012
that fucking building.

451
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,477
I gotta take a call.
So go get creative.

452
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,522
Did you get my text?

453
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,524
-So who's there?
-Chuck's at the head.

454
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,443
-Of course.
-Ira was next to him

455
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,028
and Prince on the other side.

456
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,155
-Son of a bitch.
-That's what I said.

457
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,865
Senator Vanderveer
and Governor Sweeney

458
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,200
and the rest of them
were up on the board.

459
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,035
They were sitting
down to dinner,

460
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,621
but it looked like a major
fuckin' initiative to me.

461
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,122
There was an empty seat,
too. I'm not sure for who.

462
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,166
I-- I couldn't see the placard.

463
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,710
So tell me exactly what it was
you overheard Chuck saying.

464
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,046
"Premise, two ways.

465
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,048
Banking laws are
a threat to liberty,

466
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,008
or banks without regulation are

467
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,718
the true threat to liberty."

468
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,221
First,
are we a people at liberty?

469
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,765
Then,
are we free to bank how we want?

470
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,850
Yeah, premise.

471
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,518
It's a fucking attack on me.

472
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,062
I'm gonna Sherlock
Holmes this thing

473
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,188
until I figure it out.

474
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,245
Yeah?

475
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,913
I'm calling you
as my banking trustee.

476
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,415
Seems like your son is
having a soiree tonight.

477
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,917
And your invite must have

478
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,294
gotten caught up
in the spam filter.

479
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,797
Feels like it's a
meeting of my enemies

480
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,382
arrayed against me.

481
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,260
So I need you to crash
and send me dispatches.

482
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,345
Copy that.

483
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,305
Doc, am I game ready?

484
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,684
Like Julius Erving in 76, baby.

485
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,687
In.

486
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,397
Good.

487
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,107
I know I said, I'd take you to

488
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,608
Tom Colicchoi's new restaurant.

489
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,652
-Yeah.
-But don't be disappointed.

490
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,614
I brought Tom Colicchio to you.

491
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,368
-Hey, Wags. How you doin'?
- Chef.

492
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,786
Good evening.

493
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,122
So this is a dish
that I created back

494
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,790
when I was at Gramercy Tavern,

495
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,458
and I thought I'd
revive it for this evening.

496
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,253
It's a pea purée
with a fondue of crab.

497
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,296
There's some bacon,

498
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,672
a little bit of sumac,

499
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,799
and pink peppercorns. Enjoy.

500
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,092
Chef, you're a genius.

501
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,468
Thank you.

502
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,639
Hmm. Smell that broth.

503
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,808
Uh-mm.

504
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,643
Wagner.

505
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,895
I'm here to get you ship-shape
on banking regulation.

506
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,982
Hard Bob.

507
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,151
I thought the usual whiff
of bullshit had dissipated.

508
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:03,071
My mind is a repository
of FDIC rules and regs.

509
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,489
I don't need any help.

510
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,408
But I will certainly
ask you if I do.

511
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,827
How will fee structure
and annual percentage rate

512
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,830
calculations be
disclosed to consumers

513
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,751
to ensure compliance with
the truth in lending statutes?

514
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,173
Let's not bore the lady
with these tedious questions.

515
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,507
Come with me.

516
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,760
I will parry these
softballs and more.

517
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,512
Let me handle this tinhorn.

518
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,681
Why don't you make
a TikTok or something?

519
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,853
How would you ensure
that error resolution policies

520
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,521
remain within
the guidelines of--

521
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,856
Look, you've made your point.

522
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,524
I'm lost in the fuckin' weeds.

523
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,026
I need you to coach me.

524
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,196
But privately,
not in front of my lady friend.

525
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,530
I will have the
documents brought to you,

526
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,866
and we can start tomorrow.

527
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,409
All right.

528
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,705
Hey, Wags,
can you come down?

529
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,209
Look, in business, I've always
been a fan of proper regulation.

530
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,335
A level playing field.

531
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,879
I feed on fair competition.

532
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,632
And I feel the same way about
my latest venture, Hypercube,

533
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,300
which is the digital equivalent

534
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,511
of a brick-and-mortar
bank for today and beyond.

535
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,055
So for the purposes
of our conversation,

536
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,890
I'll call myself a banker.

537
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,350
And as such, I have to say,

538
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,976
there must be a
limit to the strangling

539
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,062
regulation certain
factions propose--

540
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,021
Whoa...

541
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,398
Sorry to interrupt.

542
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,525
I thought we had plans tonight,
son.

543
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,069
Must have gotten
my dates crossed.

544
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,320
-No, we didn't, Dad.

545
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,738
We have none.

546
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,533
Marcia, you look radiant.

547
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,577
And you look the picture of health,
Charles.

548
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,079
Oh, that's thanks to me.

549
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,414
He's my medical man.

550
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,915
Yeah, I keep his meds straight,

551
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,500
his rod straighter
and his nose clean.

552
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,335
Well, that part's up to him.

553
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,462
Well, uh,

554
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,549
now that you're here,
you might as well post up there.

555
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,802
Really? No,
I-- I don't want to put you to any trouble.

556
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,262
Dad, I'm sorry,
it's a private affair,

557
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,431
but you can get a
plate and fall back.

558
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,434
And our event has a
strict subset of rules.

559
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,687
So I'm going to have
to insist on your silence.

560
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,106
-I'm Helen fucking Keller.
-Mmm.

561
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,195
Well, Dad,
it's great to have you with us.

562
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,156
-I can't believe

563
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,782
you fuckin' showed
up here uninvited.

564
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,909
The only reason I'm
not kicking you out

565
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,995
is 'cause I can't do that in
front of my vaunted guests.

566
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,122
Then I guess when
it comes to whist,

567
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,124
I'm still the one
takin' the most tricks.

568
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,596
So...

569
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,806
what are we choppin' up?

570
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,147
Talk to me.

571
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,815
Yeah, Axe,
it's the fucking doctor.

572
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,151
I got a message for
you from the patient.

573
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,362
The Prince is
takin' it to the bank.

574
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,114
Is anybody listening
to you there?

575
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,283
-No.
-Then don't speak in code.

576
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,162
I'm saying the Prince
is taking it to the--

577
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,581
You mean he has a
bank? Prince does?

578
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,082
Okay,
you know what? We're gonna do

579
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,042
a quick little hearing
test when we meet.

580
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,001
No, we're not.

581
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,764
I have just
received reassurance

582
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,058
that Judge DeGiulio
is still coming.

583
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,684
So are we expected to go on

584
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,353
like we're in colonial
times until he does,

585
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,771
or can we have a
regular conversation?

586
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,689
No one forced you to come.

587
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,858
I-- I have to admit I
took pause at having

588
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,860
a stark raving capitalist
here in the first place.

589
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,362
But then I listened to

590
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,656
some of our esteemed
guests and relented.

591
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,449
An Attorney General
who actually listens.

592
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,700
A novel concept for our age.

593
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,333
We have to deal
with this ...

594
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,876
directly.

595
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,711
You said, "Yellow light" to Axe.

596
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,880
But the research I gave you
said clearly that cannabis money

597
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,674
is a red light for
banks at this moment.

598
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,841
We agreed we
wouldn't even pitch it.

599
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,552
And that was after I said

600
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,553
I didn't want to pitch
anything bank-related

601
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,555
but you said we had to,

602
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,223
-so I-- I don't understand.
-And now you wanna know what?

603
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,433
Why throw the scroogie
when you called for the heater?

604
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,186
I-- I pitched softball for
one season in college.

605
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,813
My out pitch was
a sinker dropped off

606
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,648
the table like a brick.

607
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,650
And yeah, if my catcher
and I got crossed up like that,

608
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,318
I'd expect her to
come to the mound.

609
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,736
As I am.

610
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,655
Why give wrong
info to the Axe Man?

611
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,532
We didn't tell him to buy.

612
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,909
Are you working against
him? For yourself?

613
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,413
I can't help if I don't know.

614
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,956
Are you going to make
sure Mase Carbon

615
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,207
stays independent
no matter what?

616
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,751
This is the "trust me" piece.

617
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,212
As a person? Or as a boss?

618
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,423
Like in one of those
good sushi places

619
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,382
where they won't
make substitutions

620
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,217
or California rolls.

621
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,595
You're in safe hands when
I serve you the quail egg.

622
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,847
Uh... I'm not
working for a bank.

623
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,267
Banks are bad. Not good bad or fun bad,
just bad.

624
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,435
And boring.

625
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,104
I give you my word.

626
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,523
We'll see what that's worth.

627
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,740
Thanks for the intel on Chuck's.

628
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,117
I think I'm starting to
know what's going on.

629
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,537
I owe you.

630
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:10,378
So... I admit it. Yes.

631
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,297
The Tanner thing was about you.

632
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,885
I just thought,
this guy's full of shit. Marketable.

633
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,555
But a dime-store Pollock
with a full head of greasy hair.

634
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,807
And I wanted you to
see it sooner than later

635
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,309
before you got badly hurt.

636
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,978
So I--I exposed him.

637
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,689
You'd have seen it within
weeks if I did nothing.

638
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,027
If that's true,
I could see my way

639
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,403
to appreciating...

640
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,948
it... the intent,

641
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,909
but...

642
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,661
-There are other ways.
-Yeah, now look,

643
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,454
I am not saying I
was thinking clearly

644
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,665
or that I even knew,
exactly, what I was doing.

645
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,000
But since you
mentioned it this morning,

646
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,587
you know,
I've been chewing on it.

647
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,673
So I had to tell you.

648
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,303
Sorry to interrupt.
But I need you.

649
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,554
You looking for me, Orrin?

650
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,556
Not you. Her.

651
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,309
Okay. Well, Wend,

652
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,895
you and I will finish
this convo later.

653
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,189
That we will.

654
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,778
You don't have the liquid assets

655
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,571
to pay out Chuck,
lump sum right now.

656
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:22,325
I can fight off his demand
for a week or so, but...

657
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,411
he's going to get in.

658
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,970
I see the trading of
blows has begun already.

659
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,139
Don't tell me I
caught you off guard?

660
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,266
I just want to make sure you
are ready to parry my attack.

661
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,060
Like Louden Swain himself.

662
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,520
And I want to make
sure you are able

663
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,313
to deliver the
Solicitor General.

664
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,732
He's pretty darn key here.

665
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,734
To our own vision quest, yes.

666
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,736
DeGiulio will be here.

667
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,988
But as to where he'll land,
I am less confident.

668
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,740
He's formidable.
A veritable Shute.

669
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,576
I'll get his shoulders
down for the three count.

670
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,036
Best of luck to you on that.

671
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,132
I haven't seen you
leave your office.

672
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,509
Is that your way of
asking if I've had dinner?

673
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,762
You're usually more direct.

674
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,430
To go see Axe.

675
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,556
To tell him that you're
choosing Mase Carb.

676
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,932
I'm considering his offer

677
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,643
to work for Axe Bank.

678
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,228
I see.

679
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,730
When you factor in your bonus,

680
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,148
you'd make less
there than you do here.

681
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,483
What tempts you
about his offer that

682
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,942
I won't be able to match?

683
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,819
Stability.

684
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,905
Working here,
we're always fighting for our lives.

685
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,948
Don't get me wrong,
I love a challenge,

686
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,201
the thrill of a big win
when we land new money.

687
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,495
Oof,
it's like hitting your number in roulette

688
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,914
and letting it ride. But
you keep that up and--

689
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,083
You'd rather be the house.

690
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,294
You don't ask me a lot
about my life before we met,

691
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,087
and I like that.

692
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,632
I figure your own past is
full of difficult memories

693
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,467
you'd rather not retread,

694
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,052
and you're extending
me the same courtesy.

695
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,929
You're right. I
don't like to pry.

696
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,222
But I want you to feel
comfortable sharing

697
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,723
anything with me.

698
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,480
When I was 12 years old,
my dad found Jesus.

699
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,566
He left a lucrative career
in advertising for the pulpit.

700
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,985
He said he couldn't stand
another day of writing jingles

701
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,155
that people could
whistle on their way to hell.

702
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:28,785
He wanted to climb
Jacob's Ladder instead.

703
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,788
He threw our whole family
into debt. We lost our house.

704
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,333
I worked my way through college,
and I still have loans.

705
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,460
I appreciate your
sharing that with me.

706
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,838
But it leaves me wondering
what we've been doing

707
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,464
this whole time together, then,

708
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,007
if you never felt
secure or provided for.

709
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,468
So maybe I have
some trust issues too,

710
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,971
but that's not all of it.

711
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,682
I don't want to be
dependent on you.

712
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:54,143
I can't count on you
providing for me forever.

713
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,312
That's not fair to
either one of us.

714
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,816
I need to be able
to provide for myself.

715
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,653
God never made any sense to
me. Neither did heaven or hell.

716
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,154
But the markets do.

717
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,781
You are punished or
rewarded as you deserve.

718
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,533
It's not up to anyone's whim.

719
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,452
That's the kind of stability
I can devote my life to.

720
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,301
Let's get into the far
reaches of liberty and the law.

721
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,553
Marijuana, specifically.

722
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,847
Legalization as
a form of liberty

723
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,348
and a source of tax revenue?

724
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,226
Or is it a furtherance
of moral decay

725
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,062
that needs to be curtailed
in order to preserve

726
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,898
liberty of thought?

727
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,025
Let me kick this off,
'cause I have something to say.

728
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,904
-Legalization, I'm for it, and--
- I don't know, man.

729
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,530
Say what you will
about moral decay...

730
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,240
-Excuse me--
-But you don't know true freedom

731
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,867
until you've gotten behind
some government-derived,

732
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,118
pharmaceutical-grade jump juice.

733
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,539
Amphetamines, baby,
you know what I mean?

734
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,958
Of course you don't. Wink wink.

735
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,752
I'm not talking about
some sweaty meth cookers

736
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,670
wearing rebreathers
and hitting up every CVS

737
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,298
inside the county line
for Sudafed and Drano.

738
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,716
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

739
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,885
I am talking primo caca,

740
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,095
turned out by chemist-vintners.

741
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,889
And I, for one,
cannot wait to see the ground that these

742
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,600
high-end grasshoppers
break out once it's legal.

743
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,778
Moving on.

744
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,285
We used
to call it Mary Jane,

745
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,746
sometimes tea.

746
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,123
But whatever you put
in your pipe and smoke,

747
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,250
that's what they are
arguing about right now.

748
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,294
Cannabis?

749
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,754
That's what the marketers
want you to call it, yeah.

750
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,673
And the-- the
conversation has turned to it

751
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,342
as business source or revenue.

752
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,260
Who's pro and who's against?

753
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,179
Prince is for it.

754
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,515
And they keep mentioning
DeGiulio is showing up.

755
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,809
The federal government's
going fully legal?

756
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,769
Nah. Is that the thing?

757
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,524
Try one of the
upstairs commodes!

758
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,275
And have a little respect
for a man with one

759
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,486
recently-installed
fucking kidney!

760
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,614
I gotta get back.

761
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,126
Bill,
I need you to check on the status

762
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,420
of all current
marijuana legislation,

763
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,006
as well as any public statements
made on the subject by Graham,

764
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,341
Vandeveer, or Sweeney.

765
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,301
And find out what's moving
through the federal system

766
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,845
right now or might be soon.

767
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,847
Call in anybody
you'd like to help.

768
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,933
Wags!

769
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,437
I need your help on something.

770
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,865
Where can I get $25 million,
quick?

771
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,408
We gonna plan a heist?

772
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,743
Should I get Danny
and Rusty and the crew?

773
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,287
No, really. I need 25. Now.

774
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,122
Chuck is going to use
the divorce settlement

775
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,790
to get a look at our books,
and leg over into Axe's,

776
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,584
if I don't lump sum him.

777
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,044
Can't let that happen
because it won't stop,

778
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,962
             -even there.
            -It will not.

779
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,006
You don't have the ability
to lay hands on that amount?

780
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,341
It's illiquid or tied up in the
divorce settlement with Chuck.

781
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,803
Could you lend it to me,

782
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,264
and use my piece of the
company as collateral?

783
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,391
I can't be seen as
pulling money right now.

784
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,894
What about the special trustee,
your former father-in-law?

785
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,312
-He's a man of means.
-No. No way.

786
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,646
Makes it worse.

787
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,148
Well,
you need someone like that:

788
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,234
deep pockets and willing
to go into them for you.

789
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,236
Axe. He'd--

790
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,696
I am not comfortable with that.

791
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,490
We need to keep
Mase Carb separate,

792
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,241
because if Axe gets angry,
he could trash it for spite.

793
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,077
Well, we need to solve this.

794
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,578
Otherwise,
Chuck will be here Monday morning,

795
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,080
in his white Gil Grissom coat,

796
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,415
ready to do an autopsy
on our business.

797
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,419
Apologies and salutations.

798
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,922
Mmm.

799
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,423
If it isn't the man of the hour.

800
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,926
If that hour were
several hours ago.

801
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,261
I figured this was
better than nothing.

802
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,764
I missed the festivities, I see.

803
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,350
Which were spirited at times.

804
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,019
Since you're here,
Mr. Solicitor General,

805
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,314
perhaps you can be of
answer to our final question,

806
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,067
the path to
legality of cannabis.

807
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,944
Well, as you know,
I can't take a side.

808
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,946
United States is my only client.

809
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,448
But there is a case looming,

810
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,161
and its issues echo many other
cases from many other states.

811
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,746
But it's a conservative court.

812
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,915
So don't we know
how it would rule?

813
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,959
It is. But as the
states' rulings

814
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,961
for legalization pile up,

815
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,254
the likelihood of the high court

816
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,131
changing with the times, grows.

817
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,092
It's a living body,
adhering to the Constitution, of course,

818
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,386
but not deaf to our age.

819
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,304
SCOTUS isn't the Vatican.

820
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,265
Exactly the theme
of our discussion.

821
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,810
What are the chances the
case goes before the court?

822
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,979
Well, I'm not a betting man,
but hell,

823
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,274
if I were, even Ladbroke's
doesn't take action on this,

824
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,527
but I wouldn't bet against it.

825
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,539
Let's eat!

826
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,249
Oh, I already finished.

827
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,792
He served the main course,

828
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,210
and I didn't want
mine to get cold.

829
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,796
Sorry. But I mean, cold chicken?

830
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,214
Bleh.

831
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,426
Of course. You're right. Blech.

832
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,512
Well,
I hope you don't mind watching me eat.

833
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,889
Can I get you some more wine?

834
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,185
I just have
a quick question.

835
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,770
This form asks for
my department head.

836
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,314
Would that be you?

837
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,025
And actually,
what's my department?

838
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,277
Wait, what's my new title?

839
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,029
Can I pick it myself?

840
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,533
Does my office look any different,
Tuk?

841
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,329
The tablecloth, the candlelight?

842
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,958
Maybe the beautiful,
young inamorata sitting right here?

843
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,377
Do   any   of
these signs tell you

844
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:57,840
that now is not a good time?

845
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,718
Let's review some basics.

846
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,306
I am the goddamn
CEO of Axe Bank.

847
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,141
I am neither your
department head

848
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,937
nor the person you come to
with your imbecilic questions.

849
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:15,524
I have much,
much bigger fish on my metaphorical plate,

850
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,027
and a fucking cold   coq
au vin on my actual plate.

851
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,947
And nobody likes cold   coq,
you know what I'm sayin'?

852
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,994
He needs to be made
a fucking example of.

853
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,663
Don't you run from me,

854
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,790
you loathsome
little prick squirt!

855
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,042
Fucking cunt!

856
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,631
Mike Prince and my
son are squarely at odds

857
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,132
over this ganja business.

858
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,592
I've
heard it from you...

859
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,261
...John Birch
Society types before...

860
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,595
-What? You've got to be kidding!
-...on cannabis.

861
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,180
It needs to be
legalized and federally.

862
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,890
-Yeah. Right on, hophead.
- Oh, well,

863
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,267
-that's great.
- It got heated as hell.

864
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,435
Barbs and brickbats
tossed around.

865
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,063
The long and the short it is:

866
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,691
Prince kind of
kicked Chuck's ass.

867
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,567
Meanwhile, all that product

868
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,236
can be taxed.

869
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,991
Prince kind of

870
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,661
handed Chuck his ass
in his own dining room.

871
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,330
DeGiulio said it'll
come before the court.

872
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,790
Both of them seemed to think

873
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,834
that was a victory
for their side.

874
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,336
But I wouldn't invest
in cannabis right now.

875
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,796
Too much uncertainty.

876
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,674
Hold on.

877
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,303
That was no fight.

878
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,972
That's what they
wanted us to think.

879
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,894
They're in this together. My
two enemies have linked up.

880
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,188
They're trying to make
marijuana money safe to bank,

881
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,732
for Prince.

882
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,608
He gains these
deposits for his bank

883
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,819
and crushes mine in
the fucking process.

884
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,661
Bill, it is federal.

885
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,497
Get Bach to find out what
existing marijuana cases

886
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,333
can be appealed to
the Supreme Court.

887
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,169
Some laws are gonna change,
and we gotta be ready.

888
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,128
Is Victor there?

889
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,087
Yep.

890
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,676
-Yo.
-Taylor and Rian,

891
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,345
tell them the yellow
light is going green.

892
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,639
That Axe Holding is
going all the way green.

893
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,017
Set up the leading
marijuana companies

894
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,270
for pitches, with incentives,
to be handled by Axe Bank.

895
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,980
Got it.

896
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,148
Find out which cannabis
companies Mike Prince

897
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,025
is pursuing or in.

898
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,612
Medical, recreational,
CBD, THC, paraphernalia,

899
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,821
payment processors.

900
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,490
Someone's about to get smoked.

901
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,741
You got that right.

902
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,034
Whatever he's going after,

903
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,535
I'm gonna take it.

904
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,917
You're leaving.

905
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,919
Yeah, to let you do your thing.

906
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,879
This night turned
into a mess. I'm sorry.

907
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,465
I was hoping I could show you
that I could be both a bank CEO

908
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,510
and a substantial suitor,

909
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,262
the kind you'd think
long-term about.

910
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,140
The kind you'd be proud
to introduce to your folks.

911
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,976
Instead,
I showed a side of myself that was--

912
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,896
That was totally baller.

913
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:02,650
I loved watching
you ream that beta.

914
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,694
I was beginning to worry
that you were past it.

915
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,322
But you're no lap dog.

916
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,409
You're a Rottweiler.

917
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,247
Finish up here and
have the front desk

918
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,082
let me up to your place.

919
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,918
I'll be waiting for you.

920
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,640
Huh.

921
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,276
Hi.

922
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,155
Wend, look,
I only half said it before

923
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,906
we got interrupted, about uh,

924
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,950
why I hated you and Tanner--

925
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,952
Let me do this first.

926
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,080
Because until it's done, uh,
I can't hear anything else.

927
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,290
Until what's done?

928
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,708
Chuck.

929
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,043
I need his hand out of my pocket

930
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,629
and his nose out
of-- our business.

931
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,465
I can give you the long buildup

932
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,467
or cut to the punch line,
which is:

933
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,802
I need you to buy out my
shares of Mase Carbon

934
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,471
today in cash.

935
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,139
And promise to let
me buy 'em back at par

936
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,724
whenever I can.

937
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,142
How much?

938
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,227
It's $25 million.

939
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,529
Done.

940
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,467
I sold to Axe.

941
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,639
You agreed not to do
that mere hours ago.

942
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,390
Did our discussion
mean that little to you?

943
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,184
I know. But then I realized:

944
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,519
We can trust him.

945
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,521
You can.

946
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,314
You must know that
sounds ridiculous.

947
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,024
How can I suddenly trust him?

948
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,527
Because he wouldn't
do anything to hurt me.

949
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:13,697
And I know I'm the only
person in the world that's true of.

950
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,283
He's hurt you before
when he's needed to.

951
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,618
He did.

952
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,036
But I understand why.

953
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,877
And things are different
between us now.

954
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,761
I see.

955
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,557
In that case, I'll affirm it.

956
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,895
Good.

957
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,689
I'm glad to hear you say that.

958
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,132
Have you made your decision yet?

959
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,342
Still torn.

960
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,262
I have been thinking
about what you said.

961
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,516
But I believe I can do both,

962
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,852
handle the bank and Mase Carb.

963
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,854
I'd like to pitch it to Axe.

964
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,941
Well, then, technically,
you still work for me.

965
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,110
So I have the power to do this:

966
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,278
You're fired.

967
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,284
I'll go to Axe, then.

968
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,202
I'll get him to back me
up and you know he will.

969
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,246
IR girls are growing on
trees out there these days.

970
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,459
How can you be so spiteful?

971
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,960
Where is this coming from?

972
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,629
You told me about
your trust issues.

973
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,505
Now I'll tell you about mine.

974
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,341
Every time I trust someone
close to me to make a decision,

975
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,925
they choose to fuck me over.

976
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,927
I thought you were
different. I was wrong.

977
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,179
It's that simple to you?

978
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,680
Yes, it is. You made it so.

979
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,892
I'm not torn anymore.

980
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,352
Not at all.

981
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,021
If that's how you feel about me

982
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,148
after everything
we've built together,

983
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,983
then it's all clear.

984
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,527
Maybe for the first time.

985
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,863
Well,
I'm glad I could elucidate for you.

986
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,492
You talk a big game
about worshipping logic,

987
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,286
clean, emotionless simplicity.

988
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:28,248
But every move you make
comes from a personal pain

989
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,918
so deep you can't
even recognize it.

990
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,590
Stay out of the apartment
until I clear my shit out.

991
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,188
We did it.

992
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,024
All these people are going
to push our agenda forward.

993
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,526
They texted me.

994
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,946
I know it is so because
I can almost feel

995
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,907
that bit of melancholy
that comes on the precipice

996
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,326
of momentous success.

997
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,037
Comes on the precipice of failure,
too.

998
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,581
True.

999
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,838
That argument was a nice touch.

1000
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,215
Convincing.
Almost felt personal.

1001
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,299
To sell it.

1002
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,093
Ah. Ah-ah.

1003
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,432
Oh, morning, sweetheart.

1004
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,100
You're up early.

1005
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,977
Hi, Dad. Couldn't sleep.

1006
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:32,396
Oh. Hey, uh, this is Mr. Prince.

1007
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,064
Call me Mike.

1008
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,315
Hello.

1009
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,317
What's that smell?

1010
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,571
Remnants of your
grandfather's cigar.

1011
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,865
-You hungry?
-Mm-hm.

1012
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,575
Good.

1013
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,079
That's yours.

1014
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,796
Hey.

1015
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,464
Hey.

1016
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,429
You were right earlier.

1017
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,767
It's, um, it's true.

1018
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,770
I was trying to ruin
Tanner in your eyes.

1019
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:51,446
But not as a favor to you,

1020
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,658
or to try to show you
something about him,

1021
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,497
but because of you.

1022
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,003
Because I couldn't
stand you being with him.

1023
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,593
Or anyone.

1024
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,515
I can't stand it.

1025
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,188
You don't want me
to be all alone though.

1026
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,027
You can't want that.

1027
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,323
No.

1028
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,201
I do not.

1029
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,081
That's what I'm
experiencing right now,

1030
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,042
and it's making me realize it.

1031
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,343
I know.

1032
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,768
I look at it... honestly,

1033
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,770
but I've never allowed
myself to really think,

1034
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,939
I feel the same things
when I look at you.

1035
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,945
I want everything...

1036
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,408
I've waited so long
to hear those words.

1037
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:42,265
I wanna speak in holy tongues

1038
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:48,271
I wanna cuss and run the streets

1039
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:54,361
I wanna doubt what I can't hold

1040
00:51:56,488 --> 00:52:00,075
Then tell God that I believe

1040
00:52:01,305 --> 00:53:01,192
