        I'll let him know

132
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,708
 that my triple board certified
 skills remain as sharp as ever.

133

 I have the lowest complication
     rate here at Chastain.

134
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,439
      I know, and your rate
  used to go down every month,

135
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:24,441

      it's been inching up.

136
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:28,111
Well, it's understandable, given
  your recent brush with fame.

137
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,872
        -Book signings...
 -No, no, that's not fair, Kit.

138

139
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,967
     lesser surgeons won't.

140
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:36,970

00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:44,978
           Dr. Austin.

146
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,313
         It's a pleasure
        to meet you both.

147
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:49,315
 My job here is to watch you two

148
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:51,301
        in ways you can't
        watch yourselves,

149
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:53,987
     to point out tiny flaws
  before they become big ones.

150
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,306
      Surely neither of you
     thinks you're perfect?

151
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,083
   Probably the wrong question
         for this crowd.

152
00:06:58,234 --> 00:06:59,918
How would each of you rate

153
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,144
        your performance
        in this morning's

154
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:03,146
   pancreatic mass resection?

155
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:05,148
 Hey, that patient will be fine.

156
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,409
 "Fine" hardly seems like a goal
    worthy of the illustrious

157
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,836
         Dr. AJ Austin.

158
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,988
   Does the back of your book
         say you're just

159
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,932
         an okay doctor
      at Chastain Memorial?

160
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,009
       When you're ready,

161
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,418
  let's meet in the conference
     room to review footage

162
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,437
     of your latest surgery.

163
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:21,014
      Well, wait, that tape
          gets deleted.

164
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,925
      Not today, Dr. Bell.

165
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,593
            Cheer up,

166
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,654
         this'll be fun.

167
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:32,433
          I always love
    the first day of school.

168
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,537
     Make sure to get a seat
         right up front.

169
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:42,109
Mr. Crisforth.

170
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,020
       Looks like you had
       a stroke last year.

171
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,372
          A small one.
    I'm working my way back.

172
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,374
           Look here.

173
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,695
    Your wife says it's been
   difficult to care for you.

174
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:54,806
     She said that? Celeste?

175
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,033
Your balance
  never recovered.

176
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:58,368
 We have to use the wheelchair,

177
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:00,812
       otherwise you fall.
        And when you do,

178
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,314
    I can't lift you anymore.

179
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:06,376
       She's exaggerating.
 I can walk fine when I have to.

180
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,545
     -Whoa, whoa. I got you.
          -Oh, George.

181
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:10,197
            -George.
            -George.

182
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:15,160
George.

183
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,570
 Tell me, how is your appetite?

184
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,331
  I eat when the food is good.

185
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:21,891
      I cook him everything
        he used to like.

186
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:23,059
       He doesn't want it.

187
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:25,003
      And he doesn't sleep.
            He's up,

188
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:26,838
           he's down,
  every hour around the clock.

189
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:28,507
    Which means you are, too.

190
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,177
     His vitals are normal.

191
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:34,161
     I told you I was fine.

192
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:36,014
  All right, what kind of help
    do you guys have at home?

193
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,240
None.

194
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,925
         I tried to get
       a home health aide,

195
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:41,002
          but Medicare
      wouldn't pay for it,

196
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:42,187
    only for hospitalization,

197
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,189
     and we've gone through
          our savings.

198
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:46,674
That's what we get for
 dedicating our lives to the

199
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:49,176
    American justice system.
    You know the ACLU had us

200
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,754
         on speed dial?
           We defended

201
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:54,015
    every anti-war protestor
   in a thousand-mile radius.

202
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,035
      You're both lawyers?
       That's impressive.

203
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:58,945
      We'll be right back.

204
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:00,947
       Hang tight, George.

205
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:06,027
This happens way too often--

206
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,621
  elderly couples are bankrupt
      by health care bills,

207
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:11,216
    and one spouse is forced
 to do everything for the other.

208
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:13,534
       Medicare's no help
  unless they're hospitalized.

209
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,961
            Exactly.

210
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,613
      And George is stable.

211
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,281
             I know.

212
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,617
       Celeste is the one
     hanging on by a thread,

213
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,209
       and stats show that

214
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,970
    the burden of caregiving
         falls on women.

215
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,212
 Nothing you're saying is wrong.

216
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,641
      -She needs our help.
     -Except that. She needs

217
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,735
     someone's help, but we
   treat people who are sick.

218
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:34,647
  As of now, there's no medical
  reason to admit her husband.

219
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,466
      I mean, you're right.

220
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:39,160
           I often am.

221
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:43,898
 Let's call in a social worker.

222
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:45,491
See those lines?

223
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:46,567
             -Yeah.
         -There you go.

224
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:47,994
      -And see those bars?
             -Yeah.

225
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:51,648
   So, that is how I can tell
 how fast your heart is beating.

226
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:53,499
I think my heart is very strong.

227
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:56,152
So strong.

228
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:57,837
     Just like your daddy's.

229
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:04,603
          Gigi, honey,

230
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:08,164
  next stop on the nurses tour,

231
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:11,610
come and see how we examine
  a patient.

232
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,353
           -Thank you.
          -No worries.

233
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,173
    Bay Two, abdominal pain,
   says she's cool with kids.

234
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:19,175
             -Hello.
              -Hi.

235
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:20,601
        I'm Dr. Hawkins.

236
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:22,436
 This is my intern for the day,

237
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,605
          Gigi Hawkins,
     and you've already met

238
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,606
    the most important person

239
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,200
    in the ER, Nurse Hundley.

240
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:31,187
    Wow, Gigi, you graduated
      med school way young.

241
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:33,206
You must be a genius.

242
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:34,916
     Tell me, what happened?

243
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,802
        Oh, I bailed off
        a frontside 180.

244
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:39,954
              Okay.

245
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,455
     Goofy foot rail grind?

246
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,807
        How can you tell?

247
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:44,625
      You braced your fall
      with your left hand.

248
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,869
      You wearing a helmet?

249
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:48,146
      Duh. My hand's fine.

250
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:50,464
  What really hurts is in here.

251
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:52,192
       Let's take a look.

252
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,380
Sorry.

253
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,550
    Daddy, I think you found
        her tickle spot.

254
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:04,979
            You. Uh,

255
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,073
try to relax.

256
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:09,409
     Allow me, Dr. Hawkins.

257
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:10,502
       This little trick,

258
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:13,229
   it fools the patient's body

259
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:15,173
  into thinking the pressure's
   coming from their own hand,

260
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,550
  which takes away the tickle.

261
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:20,995
          Look at that.

262
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,239
       You are a magician.

263
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:26,242
No, Daddy, she's a nurse.

264
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:28,261
Same thing, little one.

265
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,338
   Your abdominal exam's fine.

266
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,599
X-ray does show a fractured rib,
     but with a little time

267
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,842
         and some rest,
   it should heal on its own.

268
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,420
          Nurse Hundley
   can give you 650 milligrams

269
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:38,363
        of acetaminophen
   to help you with the pain.

270
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:41,199
       -You're good to go.
         -Cool. Thanks.

271
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,942
       Think you're going
       to get better soon.

272
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,429
Okay, you. Next patient.

273
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:53,453
       George and Celeste,

274
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,196
    this is Winston Robards.

275
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,882
        He is Chastain's
       best social worker.

276
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:00,051
 He was actually a patient here
    himself a few years ago.

277
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,128
        Dr. Pravesh and I
      almost died together.

278
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,279
   Great way to meet someone.

279
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:05,372
And Winston had every right

280
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,283
         to sue Chastain
 for what happened, but instead,

281
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:08,952
         he told our CEO
        how we could make

282
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,304
 the hospital experience better
  for people with disabilities,

283
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:13,898
        and it turns out
  we needed a new social worker

284
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,974
 and she hired him on the spot.

285
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,067
Well, it was a few months later,

286
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:17,460
       but I like the way
       you tell the story.

287
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,479
Now,

288
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:21,722
     it is my job to ensure

289
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,983
    that the both of you get
     the best possible care.

290
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,134
 So, we will come up with a plan

291
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:26,469
          to make sure
     that the two of you...

292
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,080
 I don't want anyone but Celeste
    taking care of me, okay?

293
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:31,249
  So, if that's not your plan,

294
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,976
    I can tell you right now
          to forget it.

295
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:34,477
- Right, Celeste?
- Well, the plan

296
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:35,587
      will be for you both.

297
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,905
     So, I would like to get
       a thorough history.

298
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,406
  Dr. Pravesh, you can leave us

299
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,317
    and go doctor elsewhere.
              Shoo.

300
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,261
         He's gonna take
        good care of you.

301
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:52,687
    Here you go, sweetheart.

302
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:55,756
        You must be Gigi.

303
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,091
       I'm nurse Valerie.

304
00:12:57,335 --> 00:13:01,004
I heard you were visiting today,
    so I brought some cookies

305
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:02,171
           for you...

306
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:04,598
       and for your daddy.

307
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,359
      Can I have a cookie,

308
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,103
         -Daddy, please?
           -Just one.

309
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,955
- Thanks.
- Okay if I take her

310
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:12,957
        on a little tour?
       To the break room?

311
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:15,368
        -Kids love that.
        -Can I go, Daddy?

312
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,279
             -Okay.
  -You can pick her up anytime,

313
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,690
  and stay as long as you want.

314
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,949
            Come on.

315
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,427
- Have fun.
- Thanks, Daddy.

316
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,123
I bet nurses are really hovering
     around Gigi today, huh?

317
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,367
             -Yeah.
            -And you.

318
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,203
    Wonder what that's about.

319
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:36,889
   Well, you're a really great
         diagnostician,

320
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:38,465
       so I'm sure you'll

321
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,302
make sense of it.

322
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:42,970
            Winston.

323
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,397
      You're gonna tell me
          to admit him,

324
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:47,233
   but his labs just came back
 normal, and he doesn't have any

325
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,886
        -medical reasons
    to warrant an admission.
          -So find one.

326
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,162
             My man.

327
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:53,239
         Winston always
       cuts to the chase.

328
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,982
    Good to hear your voice,
          Dr. Hawkins.

329
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,334
        Would you please
    tell my friend here that,

330
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:58,169
  ironically, Medicare will pay

331
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:01,414
  tens of thousands of dollars
    for a hospital admission,

332
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:02,990
        but not hundreds

333
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,175
     for a home health aide,
        and without one,

334
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:06,903
we cannot send this couple home.

335
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,404
     George is a fall risk.

336
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:11,683
      Celeste is suffering
 from exhaustion and depression.

337
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,409
 -Winston says that you need...
       -I heard. I heard.

338
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:16,170
     -And I agree, but we...
        -Every admission

339
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,690
         takes resources
  from other needier patients.

340
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,842
    We can't just help every
  old person who walks in here.

341
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,437
  We have to discharge George.

342
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:25,605
               No.

343
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,940
No. You can't.
  If you send us home,

344
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,535
         what will I do?

345
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:32,537
  You have to please take him.

346
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,097
    I mean, I am begging you.

347
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:35,189
        Please, take him.

348
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,600
       Celeste, would you
      like to have a seat?

349
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,295
      We're gonna take care
          of you, okay?

350
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,197
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

351
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,133
 What can you admit George for?

352
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,296
          Well, we know
      he's prone to falls.

353
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:54,208
        That could speak
     to a neurologic issue.

354
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,968
    He might need a CT scan.

355
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,045
      That's a grand idea.

356
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,064
         The magic box.
    Everyone gets a CT scan.

357
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,715
 Medicare never questions that.

358
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:04,551
  That should buy us some time.

359
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,571
       Okay, let's do it.

360
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:22,086
        What do you think
    she's writing back there?

361
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,150
        At four minutes,
 Dr. Austin performs a textbook

362
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:30,094
lymph node dissection.

363
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,321
              Okay.

364
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:35,174
   I think we've seen enough.

365
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:37,343
      We haven't even come
      to the complication.

366
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:39,586
        Yeah, he's right.
  E-Everything up to this point

367
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:40,772
 has been technically flawless.

368
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,566
      Hm. Not technically.

369
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:45,944
            Dr. Bell,

370
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,336
 I noticed you're ambidextrous,

371
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,430
  but you favor your left hand
       while you operate.

372
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:52,133
     If you learn to switch,
 you'd move faster, which could

373
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:54,435
    save a life in a crisis.

374
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,104
     And you both just take
    the instruments you want

375
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,106
         off the table,
   instead of asking for them.

376
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,108
  That costs precious seconds,

377
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,369
       and nurses hate it.

378
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:04,353
         Uh, Dr. Austin,

379
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,447
when you need better retraction,

380
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,948
        you tend to stop
        what you're doing

381
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,026
         and reposition
     the retractor yourself.

382
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:11,285
       Instead, you should
          ask for help.

383
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,212
        You let an organ
    drift out of the field...

384
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,548
         -No, I did not.
            -You did,

385
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,308
      but you didn't notice
   because you were reaching.

386
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,218
           Next time,
    ask the anesthesiologist

387
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,478
       to turn the patient
          left side up.

388
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:22,129
       It's small things,

389
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,315
 like bed positioning, that can
    make all the difference.

390
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,359
          Is that all?

391
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,321
       What I've found is

392
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:32,824
     what most often stands
     between a solid doctor

393
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:35,234
    and a spectacular one...

394
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,386
             is ego.

395
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,240
      And no, it's not all.

396
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,292
        We've got a page
        and a half to go.

397
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,901
        See? Right there.

398
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:55,179
 Your grumpy civil rights lawyer
 has a small subdural hematoma.

399
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,348
  Great. Something we can fix.

400
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:59,575
      That can help George
          and his wife.

401
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:00,667
    It's a small brain bleed,

402
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:02,002
      likely not the cause
       of George's issues,

403
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:04,522
       nor does it justify
    cracking open his skull.

404
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,173
            Come on.

405
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:07,358
 Another hospital would operate

406
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:10,010
        and cash that fat
   Medicare reimbursement, but

407
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,012
         he's, what, 78?

408
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:13,756
     The bleed could resorb
           on its own.

409
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:16,850
  If we take him to surgery, he
might not make it off the table.

410
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,202
     Is that what you want?

411
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:20,279
           Wild guess,
  that question was rhetorical.

412
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,857
  When the air hits your brain,
     you're never the same.

413
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,544
      We don't cut in my OR
       unless we have to.

414
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:30,122
     Man, I hate this case.

415
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,051
George's conditions are chronic.
      I can't cure old age.

416
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,628
 I'm a doctor who can't doctor.

417
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,181
 You must see patients like this
     all the time in the ER.

418
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,041
         Far too often.

419
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,228
         There are days
  that leave me yearning for...

420
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,955
           A scalpel?

421
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:47,957
          Spreadsheets.

422
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:50,476
             -Data.
           -Oh, right.

423
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:51,903
     I forgot you're a nerd.

424
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:54,197
It's not just that.

425
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,301
 I miss the hunt for new cures.

426
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:00,894
   Do you remember my patient
     with sickle cell, Rose?

427
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:02,822
        She made me want
   to pursue clinical trials,

428
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,916
            but I...

429
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,642
But what?

430
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,587
  You can still have your wish.

431
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:11,071
          Do research.

432
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,150
     You know, just because
      you landed in the ER

433
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:16,177
 doesn't mean you have to stay.

434
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,438
          Here you go.

435
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,276
          <i> Et tu,</i> Kit?

436
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,112
  Having a tough day, darling?

437
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:36,280
               No.
     Now, AJ, I understand.

438
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:39,266
  I mean, he can be taken down
 a couple of pegs with his book

439
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,603
     and the TV appearances,
   but do I really need this?

440
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:43,788
            Randolph,

441
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:46,773
  this isn't personal, I swear.

442
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,367
  Hospitals around the country
    are bringing in coaches,

443
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,035
           and I want
     to be on the forefront.

444
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:54,023
      I get that, I do, but

445
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,708
    we're in a relationship,

446
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,362
  so maybe talk things through
 with me before I get blindsided

447
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,455
      -next to a colleague.
      -You made me promise

448
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,458
  I wouldn't let you go the way
  of your old friend Kranepool.

449
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,295
            Fade away
     into surgical oblivion.

450
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:11,390
 If other doctors see the great
     Dr. Bell being coached,

451
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,377
      they'll be more open
to the possibility, and Chastain

452
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:17,155
      will become a better
        hospital for it.

453
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:20,974
 So, anyway, how was her advice?

454
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,493
            Helpful?

455
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,557
   Oh, so it was good advice.

456
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:30,835
        How frustrating.

I'm telling you,

470
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:25,965
         -every nurse...
           -Of course.

471
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:27,874
Where's Gigi?

472
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:29,543
    Gigi's back in preschool.

473
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,395
         She had a ball.
      Didn't want to leave.

474
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,567
   What was so funny just now?

475
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:42,240
 Hundley was just filling me in
 on the adventures of Chastain's

476
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,633
- most eligible bachelor.
- It's like
  when they put chum

477
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,077
 in the water to attract sharks.

478
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:49,080
Yeah, a nurse feeding frenzy.

479
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:51,323
        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
       It's not like that.

480
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:54,310
         Oh, the nurses
    are swiping right on you,

481
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,645
Dr. Hawkins, except for me,
  that is.

482
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:58,647
      Hey, I'm right here.

483
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,983
        I'm just saying,
        watch your back.

484
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:05,429
          Oh, come on,
     you must have noticed.

485
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:06,505
Maybe.

486
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:15,180
      I'm not ready for it.

487
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,525
       It's uncomfortable.

488
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:22,338
  Well, look, there's no rush.

489
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:25,783
   But it's been a few years,
         you're allowed.

490
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,118
          If you want.

491
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:28,344
        I don't even know
         where to begin.

492
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:30,137
How does this even work anymore?

493
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:32,790
 Okay, Grandpa, how old are you?

494
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,870
       Yeah, do I ask her
   to the town dance, or do I

495
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,298
  take her to a soda fountain?
          I don't know.

496
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,803
 All I know is that Nic wouldn't
  want you to be alone forever.

497
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,431
 For your sake, and for Gigi's.

498
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:53,352
    -You deserve to be happy.
           -Thank you.

499
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,398
        That means a lot
        coming from you.

500
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:07,900
           Very nice.

501
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:09,401
    That's me, that's my dog,

502
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:12,479
     even though Daddy says
        no dog right now.

503
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,149
        -And who's that?
            -That...

504
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,002
            -Mm-hmm.
          -...is Mommy.

505
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:20,713
      Oh, she's beautiful.
       I bet you miss her.

506
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,634
-Daddy says she watches over us.
             -Yeah.

507
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:30,330
           Hey, baby.
        Just checking in.

508
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,849
              Mwah.

509
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:34,259
    Look, Daddy, it's Marion.

510
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,502
              Yeah.

511
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:38,189
You come up a lot in our house.

512
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,082
              -Aw.
      -She doesn't get why
          you can't be

513
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:41,174
      her teacher forever.

514
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:43,176
    I'm still with the babies
         in the daycare,

515
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:46,072
   but I promise to come visit
          the big kids.

516
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:48,348
    Like today, this has been
          a real treat.

517
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:52,595
            Mm, yeah,

518
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:54,705
          look at that.

519
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:57,041
    I got to go, sweetheart.

520
00:22:57,268 --> 00:22:59,192
  Wait, Daddy, this is for you.

521
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,285
               Oh.

522
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,195
 Oh, you should frame that one.

523
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:04,273
          I don't know.
     I look a little purple.

524
00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:08,293
  It's been great having Gigi.
 Let me know if there's anything

525
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:11,280
        I can do to help
      with the transition.

526
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:12,631
        Looks like you're
        already doing it.

527
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:15,893
- Should we do another one?
- Yeah.

528
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,603
              Okay.

529
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,072
         Ah, Dr. DeSoto.

530
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,315
     Uh, you mind if I take
     a moment of your time?

531
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,484
       I'd like to go over
     your morning thoughts.

532
00:23:32,637 --> 00:23:34,970
   -Of course, how can I help?
        -Well, you can't,

533
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:36,747
    and that's my first note.

534
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:38,140
         You see, I have

535
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,160
   made a rebuttal to each one
    of your recommendations.

536
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,996
 Dr. Austin, today wasn't meant
        to be punishment,

537
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:46,315
    and it shouldn't make you
       defensive. It was--

538
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,551
      now, brace yourself--
          just advice.

539
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:54,098
  Benjamin Franklin once said,
  "Wise men don't need advice."

540
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,082
   "And fools won't take it."

541
00:23:56,177 --> 00:23:59,562
 You thought I wouldn't know the
 rest of that quote, didn't you?

542
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,000
    Who hurt you, Dr. DeSoto?

543
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:06,502
  I have a radical prediction.

544
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,671
      I think, when this is
       all said and done,

545
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:10,172
    you're going to thank me.

546
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:13,266
 And I think you relish tearing
   down accomplished surgeons.

547
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:16,954
  Maybe we should examine why.

548
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,105
 No need, I'm happy to tell you.

549
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,350
       I realized early on
    that I'm a good surgeon,

550
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:23,443
      but not a great one.
       What I am great at

551
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:27,039
    is making talented people
 even better. That fulfills me.

552
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,208
         Brings me joy.

553
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,876
 Now, Dr. Voss suggested I work

554
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:32,377
with you for the next two weeks.

555
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,120
    I could extend that time
       another two weeks.

556
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,032
     Make it a month, total.

557
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:40,227
        Or you could just
      let me eat my muffin.

558
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:51,380
        What... How about
     we go back to this one?

559
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,398
No, no. That one's even lumpier.

560
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,218
You know what? You are right.

561
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:58,537
     I will go find another.

562
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:01,223
How are you, George?

563
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:04,076
         Aside from our
   unsatisfactory bed linens.

564
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:07,563
I'm as fine as I was three hours
    ago. I should be at home.

565
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:10,174
-George, you have a brain bleed.
         -Yeah, which is

566
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:11,917
          going nowhere
       and doing nothing.

567
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,660
     That's what the doctor
          said, right?

568
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,179
  There's no reason to be here.

569
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,164
      In fact, I'm leaving.

570
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,476
     Wait a second, George.

571
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,004
              See?

572
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,481
      I can walk just fine.

573
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:28,508
Can you walk in the hall for me?

574
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,194
Okay.

575
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:38,160
          Okay, George,
      come on back for me.

576
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:43,541
      All right, sit down.

577
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:51,131
         Okay, stand up.

578
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:56,445
George, do you find it difficult
          to get moving

579
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:57,704
       after you stand up?

580
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:00,299
              Yes.

581
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:01,708
       And your muscles--
       do they feel rigid?

582
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,952
       All the damn time.

583
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:06,230
           What is it?
      What does that mean?

584
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,293
          Parkinson's?
          Are you sure?

585
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:14,146
       Irregular arm swing
      first tipped me off,

586
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:16,982
         but he also has
     bradykinesia, rigidity.

587
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:18,576
 It's early, and we can help him
        with medication,

588
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:20,319
          -but it's...
       -It's progressive.

589
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,970
           Here I was,
      looking for a problem

590
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:24,397
  to fix, and now all I've got

591
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,584
   -is a much bigger problem.
      -Oh, that poor woman.

592
00:26:28,996 --> 00:26:30,421
           All right,
    let's divide and conquer.

593
00:26:30,648 --> 00:26:32,481
     I'll stay with George,
         get him an MRI.

594
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,316
       We'll see if we can
     rule out anything else.

595
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:35,467
    I'll tag in with Celeste
           and try to

596
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:38,345
-figure out how we can help her.
             -Okay.

597
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,991
           Dr. DeSoto.

598
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:44,417
      Oh, glad I found you.
      Do you have a minute?

599
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,436
           Of course.

600
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:47,179
          I just wanted
     a quick progress report

601
00:26:47,331 --> 00:26:49,273
   on our two favorite pupils.

602
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,591
      Did I tell you that,
  before I went to med school,

603
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,018
    I did Teach for America?

604
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,020
       Taught kindergarten
         for two years,

605
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,356
       and I learned that,
 when a child throws a tantrum,

606
00:26:57,508 --> 00:26:59,508
      you have to let them
      wear themselves out.

607
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,935
Then they come around
  in the end.

608
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,437
     An eerily apt metaphor.

609
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:06,123
              Um...

610
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:08,350
  If you don't mind my asking,
           is it true

611
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:11,019
    you're in a relationship
         with Dr. Bell?

612
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:12,521
              I am.

613
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,040
        But not to worry,
   it's all on the up and up.

614
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:17,876
       HR is fully aware,
     and we're both adults.

615
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,044
     Of course. It's just...

616
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:21,955
        in my experience,
       a workplace romance

617
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:25,200
   between a CEO and a surgeon
 can be a recipe for dysfunction

618
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:27,202
           -and I'm...
         -Oh, I'm sorry.

619
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:31,707
  I wasn't aware you were also
 board certified in psychiatry.

620
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,709
           Forgive me.

621
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:36,061
I was afraid Dr. Bell might come
  to you after meeting with me.

622
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,971
  Try to use your relationship

623
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:39,715
  to request special treatment.

624
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,142
   I wouldn't let that happen.

625
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,903
         As you can see,
  advice is often not welcome,

626
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,497
   but it is well-intentioned.

627
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:54,171
Celeste?

628
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,467
Celeste?

629
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,666
            Celeste?

630
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,852
            Celeste!

631
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:11,647
 Hey, I need some help in here!

632
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:20,439
    Brent Porter. 22-year-old
     with abdominal trauma.

633
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,592
      Yeah, I can see that.
       Put him in Bay Ten.

634
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,187
     What's the old saying?
      "Kids in frat houses

635
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,354
   shouldn't throw each other
       into glass tables"?

636
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,523
        Hard to believe,
   but his vitals are stable.

637
00:28:30,617 --> 00:28:34,378
       Okay, on my count,
   slowly and very carefully.

638
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:36,380
        One, two, three.

639
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:37,697
              Good.

640
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:42,110
       So, two questions:
         What happened?

641
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:43,536
- And what are you on?
- Nothing, dude.

642
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,038
           -We swear.
           -Yeah, uh,

643
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,782
     we were just wrestling
     to blow off some steam

644
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:49,209
         -before finals.
    -That's what video games
            are for.

645
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,636
      It's not their fault.
I should've moved the furniture.

646
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,638
     And I feel pretty okay.

647
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:54,806
         Is that weird?

648
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:56,400
       Well, you're either
     very lucky or in shock,

649
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:58,218
    so let's find out which.
            What's...

650
00:28:58,312 --> 00:29:01,221
      -on you? It's sticky.
     -That's just the suds.

651
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:03,389
- Don't act like that's normal.
- There was this baby pool

652
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,059
         -of soapy suds.
 -It's like slippery wrestling.

653
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,061
         Okay, everyone
      who doesn't work here

654
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,654
  or have glass in them, leave.

655
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:12,140
              So...

656
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:13,308
Brent? Hey.

657
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:15,143
- Brent.
- His heart's racing.

658
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:17,087
         -BP's dropping.
            -Damn it.

659
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:19,506
       Not lucky, I guess.

660
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:23,177
      I hear breath sounds.

661
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:26,079
        And bowel sounds.

662
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:27,506
 He's got a ruptured diaphragm.

663
00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:29,600
    Page trauma surgery now.

664
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,351
      All right, let's go.

665
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:39,109
       How we doing here?

666
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:41,278
    She's just coming around.

667
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,505
    Celeste, I'm Dr. Hawkins.
        We met in the ER.

668
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:45,357
      Dr. Pravesh asked me
        to work with you

669
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,433
       while he's helping
    with your husband, okay?

670
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,601
        How you feeling?

671
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:50,195
           Eh, woozy.

672
00:29:50,347 --> 00:29:51,771
       What-what happened?

673
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,440
- You fainted.
- Blood and oxygen
   stats were low.

674
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,460
        When did you last
        visit the doctor?

675
00:29:56,687 --> 00:30:00,339
    -Oh, we go all the time.
          -Not we, you.

676
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,635
   I d... I-I don't remember.

677
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:09,197
   We're gonna get you a chest
X-ray and do some cardiac tests.

678
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,716
    Clara, could you send off
    a troponin, and a CK-MB,

679
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:14,460
          and let's do
     a 12-lead EKG as well.

680
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:16,296
           I'm on it.

681
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,207
     Uh, George will want me
         to be with him.

682
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:22,210
        Um, are you gonna
    transfer me to his room?

683
00:30:22,229 --> 00:30:24,613
        You need to rest.

684
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,326
      You can't help George
   if you aren't well, right?

685
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:31,069
              Um...

686
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,206
Please don't put me in there.

687
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,394
   We weren't planning on it.

688
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:42,989
       It's... it's always
       been the two of us.

689
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,342
     At home, in the office.

690
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:48,679
      We didn't have kids,
     we just had each other.

691
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,349
          And now, I...

692
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:54,000
       I have no one. I...

693
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,503
     dress him, I feed him,
       I clean him, and...

694
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:01,507
It's constant.
   It just...

695
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,675
       it just never ends.

696
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:05,195
We hear you.

697
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:07,698
         I can't imagine
      how hard that's been.

698
00:31:09,426 --> 00:31:12,870
    Sometimes, when I wake up
        in the morning...

699
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:16,098
    I look over, and I wish,

700
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:19,618
     just-just for a second,

701
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,362
        that he was gone.

702
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:26,124
That he passed
 peacefully in his sleep.

703
00:31:26,276 --> 00:31:28,552
    And I could remember him

704
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:30,703
       how he used to be,

705
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:33,473
     when he cared about me.

706
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:38,604
        Does that make me
       a terrible person?

707
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,792
               No.

708
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:47,321
That makes you human.

709
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:50,324
              Oh...

710
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:54,912
      We're gonna take care
          of you both.

711
00:31:55,063 --> 00:31:57,664
            -Promise.
           -Thank you.

712
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:09,742
- I think I passed out.
- Did I almost die?

713
00:32:09,836 --> 00:32:12,429
     -No, you're still here.
 -I-I don't understand. What...

714
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,672
        -What are you...
  -Your guts are in your chest.

715
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,006
           <i> No bueno.</i>

716
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:16,992
But that's why we are
  the best surgeons

717
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,160
          for this job.

718
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:19,269
          I'm an expert
      in abdominal surgery.

719
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:20,495
        And I specialize

720
00:32:20,514 --> 00:32:22,347
      in complicated heart
         and lung cases.

721
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:23,682
So any abdominal organs
   that have made

722
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:24,975
   their way into the chest...

723
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:26,518
It's our bread and butter, baby.

724
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,611
           Dr. DeSoto.

725
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:29,521
            Doctors.

726
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:30,739
           Who's she?

727
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:33,692
     She's just an observer.

728
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,453
     She's a surgical coach.

729
00:32:37,364 --> 00:32:39,998
              Wait.
     You guys need a coach?

730
00:32:41,685 --> 00:32:43,335
Um...

731
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:47,780
   There's no definitive test
        for Parkinson's,

732
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,358
   but I've ruled out similar
    neurological conditions.

733
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:52,302
         And he has all
       the cardinal signs.

734
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:55,046
The tremor isn't pronounced yet,
      but it's appreciable.

735
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:56,531
 Okay, so what's the next step?

736
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:58,049
      I'd like to start him
          on levodopa,

737
00:32:58,202 --> 00:33:00,051
      which should improve
  his symptoms in a few weeks.

738
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:02,704
     Okay, well, that might
   make it easier for his wife

739
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:04,372
      -to take care of him.
            -Mm-hmm.

740
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:07,467
    Just got the results back
  from Celeste's EKG and echo.

741
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:11,046
 She has stress cardiomyopathy.
     Broken heart syndrome.

742
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:12,214
           Oh, my God.

743
00:33:12,232 --> 00:33:13,991
I remember that from med school.

744
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:15,066
        I always thought
       it sounded made up.

745
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,901
 Unfortunately, it's very real.

746
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,979
It's when the body faces extreme
 physical and emotional stress.

747
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:24,501
  Like in the form of an ailing
and intensely difficult husband.

748
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:28,255
   Taking care of her husband
  is literally killing Celeste.

749
00:33:34,588 --> 00:33:36,421
   I know you don't complain,

750
00:33:36,573 --> 00:33:37,514
          but handling
      your husband's health

751
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:40,242
    is taking a physical toll
             on you.

752
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:42,335
    We've started you on meds
  to manage your heart failure,

753
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:46,023
        but the only cure
        is to relieve you

754
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,340
   of the underlying stressor.

755
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:49,251
          Now, hold on.
     You don't mean that...

756
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:51,677
George, we think the best option
          is to get you

757
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:54,105
into a skilled nursing facility.

758
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,258
     Um, physical therapists
       will work with you

759
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:57,350
     to regain your strength

760
00:33:57,444 --> 00:33:59,261
         and Celeste can
       recuperate at home.

761
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,520
 It's not a permanent solution,

762
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:02,522
     but it is the best plan
        we have for now.

763
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:05,208
        Are you kidding?
     That's a terrible plan.

764
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:07,419
    Celeste and I are a team.

765
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:10,063
    All we need is each other

766
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:12,198
  and our comfy chair at home,
          right, honey?

767
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,718
  Tell them that's what's best
         for both of us.

768
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,558
            It's not.

769
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,379
       You're going to go
 to a nursing facility, George,

770
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,307
        and I'm gonna sit
   in the comfy chair at home.

771
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:31,717
  And if you love me at all...

772
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:33,236
         Well, of course
       I love you, but...

773
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:34,696
      Well, then it's time
          you listened.

774
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,651
 I used to have a voice, George.

775
00:34:39,803 --> 00:34:42,245
          I miss that.

776
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:45,248
    All you need is somebody
      to take care of you.

777
00:34:46,143 --> 00:34:47,992
     Is that what you think?

778
00:34:48,145 --> 00:34:51,146
    Honey, I-I want you safe.

779
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:53,090
         I hate that...

780
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:57,910
     I hate that you're sick
       because of me. I...

781
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,181
   I just can't imagine living
   without you. I can't do it.

782
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:05,751
          Yes, you can.

783
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,996
          We'll adapt.

784
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:10,348
      We've done it before.

785
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,351
Remember that time
 we lost our first nest egg

786
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,187
 to bail out a hundred students
          in Wisconsin

787
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,264
      when the war started?

788
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:20,675
           Which war?
    There have been so many.

789
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,538
     Oh, I love you, George.

790
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,683
   It'll always be us against
      the world, I promise.

791
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:30,293
          It's just...

792
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,964
      ...you need to let me
           get better.

793
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,469
  The truth is, you have always
 been the secret to our success.

794
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:43,047
       A heart big enough
    for both of us together.

795
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:46,393
  I've known that for 40 years.

796
00:35:57,397 --> 00:36:00,064
    The way she looks at us--
         like my mother

797
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:03,493
       when I spill juice
  on her favorite sofa cushion.

798
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:05,069
     Still on DeSoto, I see.

799
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,646
 Don't drink the Kool-Aid, Bell.

800
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,072
     We are the O.G. kings,

801
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:11,168
 This newfangled coaching thing
         is just a fad.

802
00:36:11,395 --> 00:36:12,394
    Careful, you're starting
     to sound like my father

803
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,171
          talking about
      cordless telephones.

804
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:18,008
   She can blow her hurricane
  my way, but I will not bend.

805
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,343
     And neither should you.

806
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:21,595
       Stay strong, Bell.

807
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:24,598
               ♪

808
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,528
Uh, scalpel, please?

809
00:36:41,258 --> 00:36:42,490
Absolutely.

810
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:46,945
When our nurses
  are more efficient,

811
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:48,663
     we are more efficient.

812
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:52,450
Are you meeting resistance?

813
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:54,953
Yeah. This bowel
 is showing some signs of...

814
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,456
Pressure's plummeting.

815
00:36:58,608 --> 00:37:00,124
- Heart rate is on the rise.
- He's going into shock.

816
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:01,125
Yeah, the bowel
  is going ischemic.

817
00:37:01,278 --> 00:37:03,111
        Strangulation due
        to the diaphragm.

818
00:37:03,129 --> 00:37:03,795
Pressure's still falling,

819
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,296
      despite IV pressors.

820
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,373
- Pulse up to 130.
- These adhesions
   are so severe,

821
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,392
        it's compromising
   blood supply to the bowel.

822
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:11,394
It's time to extend
 the diaphragmatic defect.

823
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:13,980
Yeah, I just, I can't
  seem to get the angle.

824
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:16,441
- Hey, wait.
- What?

825
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:25,984
- Hmm.
- Chu, rotate the table

826
00:37:26,136 --> 00:37:27,619
        towards Dr. Bell.

827
00:37:35,495 --> 00:37:37,379
- Jessica. Two Deaver's to me.
- Hmm?

828
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,383
All right, hold retraction.

829
00:37:47,324 --> 00:37:48,581
- Mm-hmm.
- Gotcha.

830
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,516
- Strangulated bowel's free.
- It looks to be perfusing well.

831
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:01,319
And the last bleeder's
   under control.

832
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:04,339
Vitals stabilizing.

833
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:06,691
All right.

834
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:10,194
        That-that was...
      that was refreshing.

835
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,180
The Kool-Aid tastes
 pretty good, doesn't it?

836
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:13,665
Oh, yeah.

837
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,526
  I can't believe we got George

838
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:26,469
 -to agree to go a nursing home.
   -Eh, that was all Celeste.

839
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:27,862
  You guys can declare victory
 if you want. I'm staying angry.

840
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,455
     Medicare will only pay
     for the first 100 days.

841
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:32,534
   After that, there's no good
 answer for a couple like them.

842
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:34,477
           -I hate it.
 -You're speaking our language,
            Winston.

843
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:36,646
    -We love people like you.
   -Even if you manipulate me

844
00:38:36,873 --> 00:38:38,556
    into breaking the rules.

845
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,709
Hey, I've been trying to get him
      to do that for years.

846
00:38:41,728 --> 00:38:43,211
          Keep trying.

847
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:45,063
  You know, I've been thinking.

848
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,972
When George's symptoms progress,

849
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,566
      we should enroll him
      in a clinical trial.

850
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,309
       There's new drugs.

851
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,719
     You know, I was reading
     about one in Baltimore

852
00:38:51,888 --> 00:38:53,721
 that's investigating biomarkers
      into basically how...

853
00:38:53,856 --> 00:38:55,073
        Eh, hold-hold up.

854
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,333
   You follow clinical trials

855
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,335
       the way most people
     play fantasy football.

856
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:00,170
Tell me why you aren't
a scientist yet.

857
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:02,672
 This is obviously your future.
   You just got to go for it.

858
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:05,066
          I don't know,
 I just feel like it's too late.

859
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:06,492
      If there's one thing
     we have learned today,

860
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:09,471
      it's that it's never
       too late to change.

861
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:12,682
Not bad, right?

862
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:14,017
            Think so.

863
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:16,168
             -Uh-oh.
            -Doctor.

864
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,687
  The surgery went well today.

865
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,416
 Uh, a thank you is forthcoming,
  but I'm still working on it.

866
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:23,026
         Uh, your advice
     was extremely helpful.

867
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:24,361
Uh, "extremely"

868
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,421
   is gilding the lily a bit,
      but we are grateful.

869
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:28,013
          And humbled.

870
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,107
He's choking on humble pie.

871
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:31,776
   No, I've cleaned my plate,
           believe me.

872
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,185
          Well, thanks.

873
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:36,264
  I know I said you'd both need
     two weeks of coaching,

874
00:39:36,282 --> 00:39:38,208
  but I think you're good to go
        from here on in.

875
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,604
  Okay, well, that's good news.

876
00:39:42,622 --> 00:39:43,713
             Indeed.

877
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:45,882
  All right, well, good night.

878
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:47,258
          -Good night.
          -Good night.

879
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:51,888
Uh, hey, hey, wait.

880
00:39:52,115 --> 00:39:53,965
    Was there something else?

881
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,784
 It's just that you shut it down
           so quickly.

882
00:39:56,803 --> 00:39:59,712
 You know, uh, I'm still proud.

883
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,899
             Right?
      I-I'm full of hubris.

884
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,308
        And that could...

885
00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:07,145
   that could stand in the way
     of my progress, right?

886
00:40:07,297 --> 00:40:09,555
    It could block my ascent
      to the Mount Olympus

887
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,150
     of surgical greatness,
  which is, as everybody knows,

888
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,410
         where I belong.

889
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:15,653
     You haven't even judged
     my VATS technique yet.

890
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:18,156
   You've been enjoying this.

891
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:20,083
       No, absolutely not.

892
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:22,234
     The adrenaline you get
    from learning new skills,

893
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:23,953
      constantly improving.

894
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:25,422
      You were missing that
          in your life.

895
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:28,332
   Now that you've tasted it,
         you want more.

896
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:30,985
   Knowledge is exhilarating.

897
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:34,347
   A, uh, pleasure stimulant.

898
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:37,642
      10:00 a.m. tomorrow,
          your office.

899
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:48,486
 Okay, I know this is a big ask,

900
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:50,613
    but I would like to start
 shifting my professional focus

901
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:52,006
       to clinical trials.

902
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:53,950
  I would need to go part-time
            in the ER

903
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:55,285
       and you would need
    to find a new ER doctor,

904
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:57,269
   but think of all the worthy
      people we could help.

905
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,179
     Like my patient today.

906
00:40:58,198 --> 00:41:00,290
    Not to mention the money

907
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:03,293
        and the prestige
  that it would bring Chastain.

908
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,277
       What do you think?

909
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:08,614
 I think you should stop putting
    Red Bull in your coffee.

910
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:13,544
        But I also think
     it's a wonderful idea.

911
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,287
             You do?

912
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:16,556
              I do.

913
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,701
         Have a proposal
      on my desk by Monday.

914
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,391
- Ah, hey, Bubble.
- Dad!

915
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:31,729
      -Good day at school?
        -Billie told Luca

916
00:41:31,881 --> 00:41:33,531
        to stop talking.

917
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,050
      Kid wouldn't shut up
        about dinosaurs.

918
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:37,218
       It was time to go.

919
00:41:38,555 --> 00:41:42,056
Good, I'm glad I caught you guys
        before you left.

920
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:43,500
           Hey, Gigi.

921
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:44,742
This is for you.

922
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:47,245
       My own stethoscope.
            Awesome!

923
00:41:47,397 --> 00:41:49,397
Since you had so much fun
  at the hospital today,

924
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,733
  I thought you could practice
  your nursing skills at home.

925
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:53,084
    Uh, that's really sweet,
           thank you.

926
00:41:53,327 --> 00:41:56,161
   Yeah, she told me she wants
to be a nurse when she grows up.

927
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,330
        Oh. She's getting
         more practical.

928
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,332
         Uh, last week,
  it was a firefighter farmer.

929
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,927
        The week before,
 it was a professional octopus.

930
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,187
I'm sure she'll go through
   a few more jobs

931
00:42:04,414 --> 00:42:07,190
before she finds the right one.

932
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:10,935
           All right,
   I will see you guys later.

933
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,612
            See you.

             Hey...
