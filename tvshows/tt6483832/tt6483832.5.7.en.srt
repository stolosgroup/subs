  I can't have you in my life
  right now. I told you that.

3
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:06,563
  I am not trying to reconnect
  with my birth mother.

4
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:10,009
Mother has stage 4 lung cancer.

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,585
  There's only one hope left.

6
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:13,086
  Oh, it's targeted therapy.

7
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:14,662
 It could buy my mother years.

8
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:16,682
You don't eat, you barely sleep.

00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,184

  -I'm literally saving lives.
  -And what about your life?

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,915
          You and Nic
     are missed every day.

12
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:25,932
        I miss it, man.

13
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,027
       It wasn't my plan
        to leave, but...

  welcome to Chastain.

20
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:42,374
  I'm Dr. Pravesh.

  If you're smart,

    you will see the nurses

  I was shaking in my boots.

28
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,808
       You have something
  you want to add back there?

29
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,126
      No disrespect, Doc.

30
00:01:09,144 --> 00:01:11,128
   It's just that some of us
     don't scare so easily.

31
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:14,055

  They want Daddy to come back
  and work here, so Auntie Kit

36
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,262
is gonna pull out all the stops.

37
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,599
  So, when she asks us
  what we think,

38
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,177
  you are gonna say... what?

39
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:47,422
  I love it,
  but not as much as my house.

40
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:48,165
              Ah.

41
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,867
  Hey, yes, you nailed it.

42
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:53,737
  Nailed it.

43
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,008
  That's not Auntie Kit.

44
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,618
         No, it isn't.

45
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,287
  Auntie Kit got called away

46
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,824
     on emergency business,
  so she asked me to show you

47
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,793
          our nursery
    and convince your daddy

48
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,445
  to come back and work here.

49
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:12,205
  Therefore...

50
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:15,300
  it looks like
  you are stuck with Dr. Bell.

51
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,527
This is a renowned surgeon,

52
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:20,380
    TV personality, and now
    a preschool tour guide.

53
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:22,215
  Oh, you never cease
  to amaze me, Dr. Bell.

54
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:25,727
Not how either of us expected to
spend our morning. Come on in.

55
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:32,376
   So, the hope is to expand
        the grade levels

56
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:33,393
  as the kids grow up.

57
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,062
  Sounds like Kit
  has thought of everything.

58
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:38,565
  -Gigi.
  -Yes?

59
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,883
  What do you think?

60
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,994
  I love it!

61
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,479
  But do you love it
  more than our house?

62
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:46,573
Way more than our house.

63
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:48,892
Can I go color?

64
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:50,727
       What? Oh, my God.

65
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:53,380
  Yeah, get out of here.
  Go do your coloring.

66
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,233
I have hope
 because you came today.

67
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:58,660
  If you weren't gonna
  consider it, why even show up?

68
00:02:58,662 --> 00:02:59,845
  Ah, same reason you did.

69
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,422
 You don't say no to Kit Voss.

70
00:03:02,424 --> 00:03:03,682
             Look,

71
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,259
   -I'd love to come back...
     -That's what we want.

72
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:08,520
  ...but my priorities
  have changed.

73
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,356
    It's not just childcare.
 I need flexibility, weekends.

74
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,083
     There's a laundry list
    of things I would need.

75
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:15,435
 If there's a hospital out there
  that wants to do that for you,

76
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:16,645
  it's this one.

77
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:19,031
  Okay, well,
  a private practice in Buckhead

78
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,758
  offered me three years
  and childcare

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,619
  and I make my own hours.

80
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,873
  You're impossibly talented,

81
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,100
  and doling out B12 shots

82
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:33,128
  for hangovers, I mean...

83
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,364
  And that impact is minuscule

84
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,533
          compared to
     what you can do here.

85
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,677
          I appreciate
     the sentiment, but...

86
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,280
Okay.
 Well, so what about this?

87
00:03:43,282 --> 00:03:46,558
  What about
  we're stretched so thin,

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,062
  just pitch in for the day
  and just see how it feels?

89
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,138
       Really? Your plan
     is to hold me hostage

90
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,233
until I agree to come back?

91
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,959
      Well, that depends.
         Is it working?

92
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:57,719
Hawkins.

93
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,404
 Hey, I heard you were around.

94
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,240
    Listen, brother, I need
   your help with a patient.

95
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,725
  And you got AJ involved.
  That's impressive.

96
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:05,059
     It's about my mother.

97
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:06,620
  She's back in the hospital.

98
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,566
  Careful. It's hot.

99
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,827
        Hey. Uh, sorry.

100
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:15,420
        Hi, Dr. Sutton.

101
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,757
  Dr. Daniels.

102
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,176
  Daily grind. Am I right?

103
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,264
         -Here you go.
        -Uh, thank you.

104
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:31,344
  Obviously, you... you knew
  I was coming, right?

105
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:33,087
          AJ told me.

106
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,016
 I hope it's okay that I'm here.

107
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:39,444
I'm, uh...

108
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,505
    I'm not the same person
        I was years ago.

109
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:42,839
             Good.

110
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:45,842
  And congratulations
  on getting through med school.

111
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:47,661
     That's no small feat.

112
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:52,532
Uh, I mean,
 it wasn't that hard.

113
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,293
        For me, anyway.

114
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,703
 Well, maybe you haven't changed
     that much after all.

115
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:57,963
  I see you're still suffering

116
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,132
     from that dangerously
   high opinion of yourself.

117
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,692
It's incurable, so...

118
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:07,531
  Can I ask you
  a personal question?

119
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:08,882
              No.

120
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:10,867
  Obviously, you don't seem
  to despise me anymore, so...

121
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:13,127
  -I never despised you.
  -No, you-you definitely did.

122
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,721
         Look, Trevor,
      it is inappropriate

123
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:16,723
       for you to tell me
   what I feel or don't feel

124
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,391
  about you or anything else.

125
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:19,893
I knew it.

126
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:22,562
  Huh. You've been in therapy.
 You're setting your boundary.

127
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:24,472
            -Kudos.
             -Okay.

128
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:25,565
  God.

129
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:29,069
  Look, we're gonna need
  to set some rules.

130
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:31,163
   No one here needs to know
      that we're related,

131
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,831
  that you're my biological son.

132
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,482
  Agreed.
  It's none of their business.

133
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:35,559
  -Mm-hmm.
  -And?

134
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,243
        Try really hard
       not to be an ass.

135
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:40,113
  -Good advice. Anything else?
  -Just one more.

136
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:42,591
  Don't ever ask me for money.

137
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,185
       And we're positive
    this isn't a resurgence

138
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,853
  of Carol's lung cancer, right?

139
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,355
  Well, according
  to her oncologist,

140
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:59,340
  all tests show
  zero cancer progression.

141
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:02,027
  That means her targeted
  immunotherapy's working.

142
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,106
She cycled through several drugs
these last few years.

143
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,591
  You know, I honestly thought

144
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:09,759
we'd reached the end of the road
till we found this one.

145
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:12,537
  Now, I know it's not a cure,
  but, uh, you'd have me fooled.

146
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,039
  That's good.

147
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,117
  If it's not the cancer, it's
  likely something we can fix.

148
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:20,194
  -Hey, Carol.
  -Oh.

149
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:23,531
AJ, you didn't tell me

150
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:27,961
  we were having
  a VIP guest visit.

151
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:29,388
  Ah, careful, Ma.

152
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,632
     You know, flattery goes
 to his head, like brain freeze.

153
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,302
  It's good to see you again.
        How you feeling?

154
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:38,897
Uh, I've been better.

155
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,715
  Sad to hear
  you had left Chastain.

156
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:43,460
  I hope this means
  you'll be back for good.

157
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:45,311
  Yeah, well, plenty of time
  to talk about me.

158
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:47,388
   I want to hear about you.
   Tell me, what's going on?

159
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,075
            Well...

160
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,894
   I've never been so tired.

161
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:55,822
 Can't make it through<i> The Crown</i>
     without nodding off.

162
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:58,065
This woman loves Princess Diana.

163
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:03,755
 Then I started losing weight,

164
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,650
  and that had me worried.

165
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:08,927
- Maybe an infection?
- That's what I thought,

166
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,763
  but she's not responding
  to any antibiotics.

167
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,990
 Could be bacterial resistance

168
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,176
  or an... atypical infection.

169
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:19,086
  You know what? Let me get
  some labs, run some tests.

170
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:21,831
        Don't you worry.
  We'll get you some answers.

171
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,237
Mm.

175
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,911
Not, I'm "I am."

176
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:46,022
   I mean, I, Gemma, am I.M.

177
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:47,799

181
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,864
  What's up?

182
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:57,534
Let's get started, shall we?

183
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:58,626
  Dan, good morning.

184
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,312
     These are the interns
       I told you about.

185
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:04,149
Are they children, or am I old?

  48-year-old male
  with pancreatitis.

187
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,469
    What is the first thing
          that we do?

188
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:09,729
  Oh, I hope it's all right,
  I threw together

189
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,305
  a little PowerPoint
  for a possible plan of action.

190
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,732
  I love the initiative,
  Dr. Bonner,

191
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:15,327
 -but before that, what's first?
     -Get smashed.

192
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:18,997
  It's a mnemonic. Gallstones,

193
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,241
  ethanol, trauma, steroids,
  mumps, autoimmune,

194
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,818
        scorpion sting,
      hypercalcemia, ERCP

195
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,895
  and drugs.

196
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:28,322
      No, the first thing
        we do is listen.

197
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:30,416
 To the patient, and then to me.

198
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:34,328
Incoming. Multi-casualty event.

199

      a boat into a dock.

200
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,998
Okay.

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,758
  Time to suit up.

202
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,435
  We'll be back.

         You know him?

206
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,255
  He made quite the impression
  when he tried to lecture

207
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:55,592
  the doctors on how to treat
     his junkie girlfriend.

208
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:57,427
  Now I guess
  he's a doctor himself.

209
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:01,114
      Well, he's an M.D.,
       not a doctor, yet.

210
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:03,783
  Not with that arrogance.

Dr. Bonner, you're with Hundley.

213
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:11,198
             -Yes.
          -And, um...

Brooks, you're with Dr. Feldman.

215

 Are you sure, Coach? I know the
   upper extremity neurovascular

  -anatomy by heart, so...
  -They've got it handled,

217
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,448
 but there's a woman in bay five

218
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,724
 who needs her blood work drawn.
     Go help her.

219
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,227
  Seriously? That guy's hand's
  hanging on by a thread,

220
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,287
  and you trust
  Thing One and Thing Two?

221
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:26,398
  Your patient isn't
  any less important

222
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,567
  because she doesn't have
  a cleat in her hand.

223
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,111
  She needs you. Go help her.

224
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:40,227
Hey, Dad just messaged.

225
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:41,971
 They're a couple minutes out.

  Padma, I love you,

227
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,918

     and pick up a vacuum.

228
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,403
      It's important that
    we cleanse the space of

229
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:50,571
  all of the negative energy.

230
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:52,257
  Mom and Dad
  are the negative energy.

231
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,002
      Why do they do this?
     Just pop by randomly.

232
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,987
      At least they don't
      stick around, okay?

233
00:09:57,989 --> 00:09:59,431
  It's just lunch.

234
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,142
Yeah, it starts as lunch, and
then it becomes an intervention.

235
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:05,604
          Hence hiding
    your boyfriend's shoes.

236
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,347
 You do realize that, someday,

237
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:09,182
    they're gonna figure out
   you live together, right?

238
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:11,351
  Mm-hmm. Today is not that day.

239
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:12,485
Oh.

240
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,620
  -Hi!
  -Oh!

241
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,029
         -Hello, my...
             -Ooh.

242
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:25,849
  Oh, my darling girls. Mwah.

243
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:27,292
          Come on in.

244
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,869
- Oh, my.
- Hi.

245
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:32,021
     So, how was the trip?

246
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:33,373
  Not long enough.

247
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,692
  I had to practically
  drag your father

248
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:37,543
  out of that Venetian Pool.

249

 Piña coladas and the greatest
  hits of Olivia Newton-John.

250
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:41,881
I've never been more relaxed.

251
00:10:41,883 --> 00:10:44,884
        Beautiful place
    you've got here, Leela.

252
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:46,961
I hope that Devon is joining us.

253
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:49,205
  -Uh, no.
  -Oh.

254
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:52,067
- Devon's at the hospital.
- Is something burning?

255
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,227
   Oh, yeah, it's, um, sage.

256
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:56,154
  It really purifies the air.

257
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,199
- No, there's something else.
- Oh, my gosh!

258
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,994
    No, no, no, no, no, no.

259
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,579
Oh, shoot.

260
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,500
     Everything all right?

261
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,320
  Why don't we go out for lunch?

262
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:14,255
  Hmm?

263
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:20,069
 I know you're here for Carol.

264
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:22,847
   Yeah, well, my buddy says
       it's an emergency.

265
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,182
    Would I have called you
         if it wasn't?

266
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,241
         I don't know.

267
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:27,093
  Protocol suggests
  we send the patient home

268
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:28,335
  with some painkillers.

269
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:30,671
   -Something else going on?
       -Call it instinct.

270
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:33,599
You and your instincts are lucky
I'm waiting on Carol's tests.

271
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:34,693

      Intern. Bullet. Go.

273
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:41,700
 Um, Kevin is a 72-year-old male
 with a history of hypertension.

274
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,018
Uh, he came in with
sudden onset right flank pain...

275
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,204
       Left. Left flank.

276
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,264
     Uh, right. Uh, sorry.
         I mean, left.

277
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:51,768
That's, um, what he is, uh...

278
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,102
What are his vitals telling you?

279
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:55,213
   Uh, slightly tachycardic.

280
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,382
  Uh, you know,
  with the flank pain,

281
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,883
  that could be kidney stones.

282
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,627
  72 is a strange time to have
 your first kidney stone, hmm?

283
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:04,447
- What about his blood pressure?
- Oh, it's been stable.

284
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:05,706
  -Has it?
  -Yeah.

285
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,952
  Hmm. Since we started talking,
  his BP dipped down

286
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:12,121
           to 95/48
   before it popped back up.

287
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:15,400
    Devil's in the details.

288
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:21,222
  Kevin is headed into shock due
  to a ruptured aortic aneurysm

289
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:24,300
  that's leaking into
  his retroperitoneum.

290
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:26,244
 Wait, but that-that's emergent.

291
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,729
  We-we can't send him home.
  He needs surgery.

292
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,331
  Don't you miss this?

295
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,426
         He's amazing.

296

  ♪

297
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:53,688
 Her cortisol is severely low.

298
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:57,850
  So, she has
  adrenal insufficiency.

299
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:02,429
Likely due to her past courses
 of high-dose steroids.

300
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:04,524
      Which would explain
 the severity of the infection

301
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:07,118
  and the low blood pressure
  despite fluids.

302
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,861
  We can give her

00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:51,009
  And you found it hard
  to give her the truth,

758
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:52,918
  but you did it anyway
  because the patient is

759
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,105
   what comes first, not us.

760
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,760
  Hey.

761
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:03,196
  You did good in there.

762
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:07,224
  Now,

763
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:10,512
     if your interests come
   before the patient again,

764
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:15,199
  like they did earlier today,
  then Dr. Pravesh is right.

765
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:18,086
  This should be your last day
  as a doctor.

766
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:31,957
              So?

             Um...

768
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,814
  He felt pain for Carol and AJ.
  He wanted to help.

769
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,757
       I could see that.

770
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:41,801
  But...

771
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,711
  would be a journey with him.

     Yeah. I'm conflicted.

        told me to stop,
