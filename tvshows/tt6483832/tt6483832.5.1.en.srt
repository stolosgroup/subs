Chastain is experiencing
a cyberattack.

160
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:55,563
Our systems have been
compromised.

161
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:56,990
Divert all ambulances.
No new admissions.

162
00:06:56,992 --> 00:07:00,143
Okay.
-Dr. Sutton. Dr. Bell.

163
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:02,162
A 14-year-old may need
an emergent ex-lap.

164
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:04,831
-Also a scalp lac...
What's going on?

165
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,499
...with possible
basilar skull fracture.

166
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,001
What's going on here?
-Daddy!

167
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:09,594
W-What's happening to my Esty?

168
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,263
-Daddy. Daddy, help me!
Okay, we've got you.

169
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,098
Just hang on, your dad will
join you in a bit.

-Daddy!

171
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,676
Dr. Hawkins, what's going on?

172
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:19,287
Is this attack going to
compromise her care?

173
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,513
Here's how you help
your daughter.

174
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:22,682
You stay calm
and she stays safe. Okay?

175
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:24,350
You panic, she panics.

176
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,002
Where's she going?

177
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,612
Imaging.
I'll keep you updated.

178
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,597
-Is Dr. Austin gonna
stay with her?
-Yes.

179
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,009
Will you, too? Please.

180
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:34,844
I will.

181
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:36,362
Back to paper charting.

182
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:38,974
Use your heads,
remember the basics,

183
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,158
take manual vitals.

184
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,295
And if you don't remember how,
ask Hundley.

185
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,148
They just sent me their demands.

186
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,302
What do they want?

187
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,637
$5 million.

188
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,056
♪

189
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:15,160
-$5 million?
-This is insanity.

190
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,328
How could you let this happen
on your watch?

191
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,056
It's happened to 200 hospitals
so far.

192
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:21,816
Health care involves
huge amounts of data

193
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:23,335
and relies on high tech.

194
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,836
A group called Ryuk
out of Russia

195
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,914
collected over $100 million
from health care providers

196
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,232
in ransom just last year.

197
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:31,009
Well, we're not adding
to their windfall.

198
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,346
The health of our patients
must be our focus.

199
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:38,575
-If we don't pay, people die.
-The ER is already crippled.

200
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:40,760
Next they might target
Dialysis, Labs, Imaging,

201
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:42,837
ICUs, ORs.

202
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,357
Dr. Voss has called in the FBI,

203
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,584
but we are looking at
a ticking clock

204
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:50,937
that will go off long before
help arrives.

205
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:54,699
Fix this, both of you,
or you're both fired.

206
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:07,045
-All right, we're good.

207
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,697
The ransomware hasn't
hit Imaging yet.

208
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,866
Let's hope they
can't crash all our systems.

209
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:13,443
Hey, Esty, don't worry.

210
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:15,111
That machine will not
hurt you one bit.

211
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:17,447
Yeah, it's not as bad
as it looks.

212
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:18,631
It looks hella scary.

213
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:21,709
Well, it's nothing
a velociraptor can't handle.

214
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,395
Especially my favorite one.

215
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,398
How's the blind man?
Is he gonna be okay?

216
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,141
Just a broken bone.

217
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,960
You saved his life.

218
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:33,146
And the other kids? Riley?

219
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:35,648
Riley's fine.
So is Mary Charles.

220
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,651
See? That's Esty.

221
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:40,278
She's in pain, she's scared,

222
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,707
and yet she's thinking about
everyone else but herself.

223
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:47,068
Hang in.

224
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,171
I'll go update your dad
and I'll be right back.

225
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:56,094
Hey... you're in good hands now.

226
00:10:01,993 --> 00:10:03,509
So, we just took Esty to CT.

227
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,252
I'll let you know the minute
we have a full picture

228
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:06,754

229
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,681
Okay. Thank you.

230
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:11,835
I-I-I... I can't lose her.

231
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:14,446
I-I'm reeling here, I'm...

232
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,364
Sit down, sit down.

233
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:27,016
I-I know everyone says that
their kid is special, but...

234
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:28,627
Esty...

235
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,579
She's something else.

236
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,634
She's compassionate, loving.

237
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,694
She's my whole life.

238
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:41,197
You know, her mom left
a year after she was born.

00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,351
It's always been
just the two of us.

I get it.

241

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,938
-We almost lost her.
-Which is why my hand
is on this pulse.

318
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,423
We need to figure out
what's going on

319
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,158
before she crashes again.

320
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:44,698
I don't know what you're gonna
say; we've got a bum hand.

321
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,718
With one wild card.

322
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,277
I anticipated this could happen,

323
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,389
and last year I got
cyber insurance for Chastain.

324
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,892
-Well, that's a brilliant move.
-The insurance company

325
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,636
will pay something,
even if the board won't,

326
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:58,454
but not $5 million.

327
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:00,064
So we negotiate.

328
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,459
</i>
Dobroye utro.
<i> As by now,</i>

329
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:07,071
<i> you've seen your systems are</i>
<i> fully under our control.</i>

330
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,556
<i> The damage we can do</i>
<i> is unlimited.</i>

331
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:12,151
We know we have to pay you,
and we will,

332
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:15,896
but the figure you've asked for
is too high.

333
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:17,140
It's more than we can
possibly...

334
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:18,658
<i> Don't try to play us</i>
<i> for fools.</i>

335
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,754
<i> We-we have all</i>
<i> of your financial records.</i>

336
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:32,764
I can get you $836,000
by the end of today.

337
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:38,186
<i> Because you insult us,</i>
<i> we now want $10 million.</i>

338
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,998
<i> And don't forget...</i>

339
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,608
</i>
<i> If we don't pay, people die.</i>

340
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,093
<i> -People die. People die.</i>
<i> -</i>

341
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,171
<i> :</i>
<i> People die. People die.</i>

342
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:50,931
<i> People die.</i>

343
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:57,196
We finally got her settled.

344
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,291
I'd really rather you not
stir her up again.

345
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:04,778
I just watched a 14-year-old
nearly die.

346
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,613
I just want to hold
my baby, you know?

347
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:08,424
I am so sorry.

348
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,697
This is a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

349
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,957
If it's any help,

350
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,227
it is for every parent.

351
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,982
Doc, Doc!

352
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,559
They can't reschedule
my routine colonoscopy.

353
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:29,303
-I am not drinking
that chalk soup again.
-Okay.

354
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,230
Just go back upstairs
and ask them for

355
00:16:31,232 --> 00:16:33,640
a fit screening test.

356
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:36,736
You can do it yourself at home.
No prep.

357
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:38,888
Hey, Winston.

358
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,314
So, I can't access
your X-rays,

359
00:16:40,316 --> 00:16:44,168
but based on my exam,
you have a fractured radius

360
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,652
below the elbow here.

361
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:47,338
We're gonna have to
reset the bone, okay?

362
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,655
It's going to hurt.

363
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,491
We can't access anything
for the pain right now.

364
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:53,845
Not necessary.
I'm a hearty farm boy.

365
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,515
My father's remedy for
everything was rub dirt on it.

366
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,244
I trust your father
wasn't a doctor.

367
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:02,687
Full-time alcoholic.

368
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,189
But he loved all ten of us
till his last drunken day.

369
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,750
Go ahead, reset the bone.

370
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:09,360
Okay.

371
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,531
All right.
All right, you ready?

372
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:16,926
Okay. Okay.

373
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:19,120
All right, deep breath.

374
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:23,599
You're very brave.

375
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:26,269
Listen, you're gonna need
a splint,

376
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,287
but the cast room is backed up,
and so is Transport.

377
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,607
You may need to hang out here
with us for a while.

378
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:34,260
Happy to. And thank you.

379
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:36,679
We'll be back.

380
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,105
Leela.

381
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,364
Come here.

382
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:03,122
What's going on?

383
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,327
I've never experienced anything
like this before.

384
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:12,090
We're just trying to keep
our heads above water down here.

385
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,833
How's the girl?

386
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,985
She went into V tach.

387
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:18,262
-V tach? Why?
-We don't know.

388
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,766
Without imaging, it's just,
it's a total nightmare.

389
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,660
It's okay, come here.
It's all right.

390
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:27,163
It's gonna be okay.

391
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,590
What kind of monsters
extort blood money

392
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:32,335
by threatening the lives
of sick people?

393
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:33,760
These scammers are everywhere.

394
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:35,688
I have an old college friend,
a brilliant one,

395
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,098
who made it her mission to
turn the tables on hackers

396
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,694
who are stealing from
old people online.

397
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:43,621
That happened to
my uncle once.

398
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,198
They pretended he had
a bank refund coming in,

399
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,127
got him to give them
the number of the account,

400
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,130
and then they took
his entire life savings.

401
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,955
Nice, but...

402
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:03,957
possibly inappropriate
in this moment.

403
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,369
Thank you. Thank you for
helping me remember her.

404
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:09,221
I'm gonna call her. Well,
actually, maybe she can help us.

405
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:11,274
-Devon...
-Thank you.

406
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,679
I just-- I can't believe
I almost lost her.

407
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,330
Do you have any idea
why this happened?

408
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:45,925
We don't know for sure,
but our full team is on it.

409
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:48,186
And we're gonna do as extensive
of a workup as we can,

410
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,579
despite this ransomware attack.

411
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:52,190
It just feels like
everyone I love disappears.

412
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,358
-If anything happens to Esty...
-Don't go there.

413
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:58,437
Any heart problems
in the family?

414
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,198
Uh...

415
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,850
I had an EKG once.
They said it was negative,

416
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:05,185
my heart was fine.

417
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,538
I have one brother--
he's healthy, too--

418
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,083
but our-our father died
young of a heart attack.

419
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:15,421
Okay.

420
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:18,633
Okay, give me a minute.

421
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:25,205
-Are the OR's running
for emergency surgeries?
-For now.

422
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,467
But we expect they could be
hit at any moment.

423
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:30,469
Anyone critical
who can be moved

424
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:32,121
is being transported
to Atlanta General.

425
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:35,024
We should probably transfer Esty
just to be safe.

426
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:40,387
Talk to my team.
Be right back.

427
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,315
How are we looking? Can we
move her to Atlanta General?

428
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:44,800
Neuro exam is still stable.

429
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:47,303
No electrolyte abnormalities
to explain the V tach.

430
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:48,153
Tox reports are negative.

431
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:51,657
Daddy, I don't feel good.

432
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,809
I'm here. I'm right here.
What's wrong?

433
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:55,811
Daddy, my shoulder hurts.

434
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:57,329
How about here?

435
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:59,648
Yeah, that hurts, too.

436
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,984
Much more than before.

437
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:03,410
Sir, you should step outside.

438
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:06,155
The shoulder pain is referred
pain from the abdomen.

439
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:08,099
Her splenic lac
must be worsening.

440
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,825
Her pressure is trending down.
90/60.

441
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:11,494
Well, she's too unstable.
We need to get blood into her,

442
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:14,497
and we need to find a way
to operate as soon as we can.

443
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,665
Our ORs are vulnerable
to attack.

444
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:20,194
Well, if this gets any worse,
she could bleed out and die.

445
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,031
Daddy!

446
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:34,199
-Daddy!
It's okay.
We're gonna help him.

447
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:36,443
His heart's racing,
just like Esty's.
-Daddy!

448
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:38,871
Ambu Bag.
Give me
the defib pads now.

449
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:39,964
Daddy?!

450
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,949
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.

451
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:45,386
All right, charging. 200.

452
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:48,380
Daddy...

453
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:49,381
Clear!

454
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:52,351
♪

455
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:02,636
All non-emergent surgeries
canceled. I can help.

456
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:03,804
Great. Uh, can you handle

457
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:04,897
the extensor tendon injury
in Three?

458
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:06,549
Yes.

459
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:09,309
Hey, Nolan,
I have to go upstairs.

460
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:11,904
I called in a friend who might
be able to help Chastain

461
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:14,073
with this attack;
it could be a while.

462
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:15,649
-Yeah, go ahead. I got you.
-Okay.

463
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:18,060
Oh, and when you get a chance,
can you take Winston

464
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:19,986
-down to the cast room?
-Sure.

465
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:21,622
Hey, give me directions.
I can find my way

466
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:22,898
with my cane.

467
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,400
I'm sure the elevator
has braille.

468
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:25,751
No can do, buddy.

469
00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:28,262
Let me finish up here and
I'll take you myself, okay?

470
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,590
What happened?

471
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:50,684
Your heart went into a dangerous
rhythm called V tach,

472
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:53,037
and you passed out.

473
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,206
It's the same thing
that happened to Esty.

474
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,192
You mentioned you had an EKG?

475
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:02,271
Yeah. I got, uh,
hit with a line drive

476
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:04,623
at an Atlanta Braves game.

477
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,460
Passed out. A few minutes after,
they, they took me

478
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:10,295
to the, uh, ER.

479
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:13,707
-EKG was normal.
-Which ER?

480
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:16,060
Atlanta General.

481
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:19,730
Oh!

482
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:23,383
It's not V tach.

483
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:25,628
Anterior ST elevation.
He's having a heart attack.

484
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:31,500
Amy, we need 325 of aspirin,
sublingual nitro,

485
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:32,743
and 5,000 units of heparin.

486
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,227
Run to the pharmacy.

487
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:35,579
-Is the CATH lab up?
-Last time I checked.

488
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,397
Fluoro is still working.
I'll take him there.

489
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,917
I'll meet you as soon as I can.
I got to call Atlanta General.

490
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,920
The ORs have lost power
and they have no imaging.

491
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,256
We have critical patients
who need surgery.

492
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:48,317
It's life or death right now.
We have to act.

493
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,986
We must pay the ransom,
and we must pay it now.

494
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:52,838
If that means I'm fired,
so be it.

495
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,248
We have to get the bank to
move quickly with the money.

496
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,176
We will pay in cryptocurrency.

497
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:59,161
They will dictate the process.

498
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:02,088
If you refuse to do this,

499
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,757
you'll have blood
on your hands.

500
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,592
Dr. Voss, sorry to interrupt,

501
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,594
but I have someone who
might be able to help you.

502
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:09,447
This is Jessie Bhattacharjee,
an old friend,

503
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:13,266
who made a crusade of exposing
phishing scammers online,

504
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:16,528
the kind that raid
personal computers.

505
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,197
-This is a whole other league.
-We know.

506
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,957
But the exploit I created
hasn't been deployed

507
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,366
on your particular malware.

508
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:22,851
With a little tweaking,
it could work.

509
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:24,110
There's a chance

510
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:26,205
that we can turn the tables
on these hackers.

511
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:27,798
It's too late.

512
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,191
They want the money now.

513
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:30,859
We need the ORs.
They've lost power.

514
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,970
Okay, get to work.

515
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,182
And just stall
as long as you can.

516
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:41,795
I've been waiting ten minutes.

517
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:43,147
This is urgent.

518
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,132
</i>
<i> Okay, okay, hold on.</i>

519
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:48,560
<i> I think I got it.</i>
<i> EKG on Ronan Hartman</i>

520
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:49,820
<i> from last August.</i>

521
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,548
<i> Um, no ischemic changes.</i>
<i> Nothing going on.</i>

522
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,235
What I'm looking for is
subtle and easily missed.

523
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:57,720
Coved ST elevations in V2

524
00:24:57,722 --> 00:25:00,889
or V3, like you see
in Brugada syndrome. Look again.

525
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:04,560
<i> Hmm. I'll be damned. Yes.</i>

526
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:06,912
<i> Subtle, but it's there.</i>
<i> Brugada waves.</i>

527
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:09,465
Text me an image.
And thank you.

528
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,404
Yes, we've agreed to your terms.
$10 million.

529
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:17,163
There's a minor glitch
on our end.

530
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:19,016
We're waiting for the bank
to release the funds

531
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,334
so we can convert
to cryptocurrency.

532
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:24,747
</i>
<i> Why should we b-believe you?</i>

533
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:26,857
The money is coming.

534
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,027
We just need a little more time.

535
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,595
This is Mr. Robards.

536
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:42,281
He has a fractured radius
just below the elbow.

537
00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:43,523
I'll be right with him.

538
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,525
Can you have him wait
over there?

539
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:48,120
Uh, yeah, sure.

540
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:50,196
Winston, just gonna
chill out here

541
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:51,423
for a minute, okay, buddy?

542
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,553
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's nothing.

543
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,347
-Just a hell of a headache.
-Uh-huh.

544
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,393
All right, Winston,
I'm gonna need you to

545
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,894
hang out here for a second,
okay?

546
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,712
I'm gonna have you
hold onto that, okay?

547
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:06,880
Thank you, Dr. Nolan.

548
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:08,307
Thank the whole ER team
for me.

549
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,235
It's more than our pleasure.
Take care, all right?

550
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:32,072
Ronan has Brugada.

551
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:33,999
Likely his father did, too.

552
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:36,409
Esty must have inherited it.

553
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,820
Strong work.

554
00:26:37,822 --> 00:26:40,505
All right, a family history
of sudden cardiac death.

555
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:43,017
Well, they both need
defibrillators.

556
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:46,662
But that's the least
of his problems.

557
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:50,423
Ronan's heart couldn't tolerate
the rapid rhythm.

558
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:52,926
He's having a massive
anterior wall MI.

559
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:55,003
Severe blockage
of the left main.

560
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:56,505
Tight narrowing of the LAD.

561
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:57,931
This is a widow-maker, Hawkins.

562
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:00,008
This isn't amenable to stent.

563
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,786
The ORs are down, and if
we don't operate now,

564
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,372
he'll be dead in an hour.

565
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:08,459
Esty's running out of time, too.

566
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,525
Devon, it's me.
I need your help.

567
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:19,219
Listen to me carefully.

568
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:26,960
Where are we at?

569
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:29,462
We've given her two
units of blood,

570
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:30,463
and she's still hypotensive.

571
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:32,358
Her splenic bleed is
opening up.

572
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:36,195
Look.

573
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,206
Halo sign.
This is spinal fluid.

574
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,244
The skull fracture.

575
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:54,004
Created a tear in the dura,
the lining of the brain.

576
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,414
She doesn't just need
a splenectomy.

577
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,582
Now, with this CSF leak,
she's at high risk of infection.

578
00:27:57,584 --> 00:27:58,901
That's just great.

579
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:01,011
Let's start her on vancomycin
and ceftriaxone.

580
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,515
-Esty will need
neurosurgery, too.
No, that's impossible.

581
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,759
We don't have an OR,
or imaging of any kind.

582
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:10,579
We do of her spleen and brain.

583
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:13,232
I drew what I saw
after the CT went down.

584
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:18,754
You have an incredible
visual memory.

585
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:22,366
-And you're an artist.

586
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,034
It's Devon.

587
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,929
Talk fast, friend.
Two lives are on the line.

588
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:28,430
We found a power station.

589
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:30,265
<i> Does it have enough juice?</i>

590
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:32,543
Just enough to light up one OR.

591
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,786
We'll have to bag intubated
patients,

592
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:36,863
repurpose defibrillators
to monitor heart rates,

593
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,031
and hand-crank
the bypass machine.

594
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:40,426
We're on our way
with two patients.

595
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,209
He's tanking. Please tell me
there's an OR ready.

596
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:50,728
We'll have to handle
two patients at once.

597
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,480
We only have one OR
in the hospital with any power.

598
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:03,240
Excuse me.

599
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,651
I've been waiting to get
a cast for some time now,

600
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:08,820
and it's starting
to really hurt a lot.

601
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:11,081
And this sling helps
a little, but...

602
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,825
I-I'm so sorry.

603
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,327
Our tech just
went home sick,

604
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:18,404
and I don't feel great myself.
I'll find someone else

605
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:19,664
to do your cast for you.

606
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:23,001
Will you be okay down here alone
for a few minutes?

607
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:26,764
Yes, but please, I-I,
I don't mean to be a pain,

608
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,748
but I've been here all day,

609
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,250
so please don't make me wait
much longer.

610
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:33,437
I'll have someone with you
as soon as possible.

611
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,430
Need more suction.

612
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:46,266
Lap pad.

613
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:49,453
Bell, I need your
assist on the CABG.

614
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,530
My hands are a little full
at the moment.

615
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:52,790
Yeah, well, mine are, too.

616
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:55,441
I have a massive anterior MI,

617
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:58,462
and you seem to have
capable assistants.

618
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,714
Well, I'm just finishing
the splenectomy.

619
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:04,042
Okay, Leela, I'm gonna need
you to take it from here.

620
00:30:04,044 --> 00:30:05,135
Got it.

621
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,711
I know her anatomy
well from the scans.

622
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:09,548
And I can help, as soon as
I patch the dura here.

623
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,225
All right, let's
put him on bypass.

624
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,204
Talk to me.

625
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:18,631
His arteries are so
calcified, we can't find

626
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:20,208
a good landing zone.

627
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,226
It's a tough graft.

628
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:23,362
Needle driver to me.

629
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,735
Devi, Sutton, how's it going?

630
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:33,813
Found the bleeder at the
resection line. Got it.

631
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,499
Still working on patching
the dura.

632
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:39,077
I'm using AlloDerm, but I
can't stop the CSF leak.

633
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,080
Leela, harvest a piece
of omentum.

634
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:43,565
I need to use the
lining of her abdomen

635
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:45,734
to patch the dura
and seal her brain.

636
00:30:45,736 --> 00:30:47,177
On it.

637
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:52,516
-Okay, we are there.
-All right, stop bypass.

638
00:30:53,744 --> 00:30:55,352
He's in V fib.

639
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,022
Charge to 20 and give
him an amp of epi.

640
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:03,009
Epi.

641
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:06,113
-Clear!

642
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,757
Again!

643
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:14,854
-Clear!

644
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:17,690
-Damn it!

645
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:20,102
-Clear!

646
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:21,937
-All right, someone,

647
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:24,530
someone with another idea.

648
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,458
Okay, the grafts are patent.
There's no clot.

649
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,944
-A good arterial flow.
-Why did this happen?

650
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:31,630
Because his ventricle
was too sick.

651
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:33,281
It couldn't tolerate being
on bypass.

652
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:34,966
No, that-that's unacceptable.
We can't call it.

653
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:37,895
He's going through
multisystem organ failure.

654
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,288
We have to keep trying.
Think of Esty.

655
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,341
I am thinking about Esty!

656
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:45,794
I'm the one who has to tell her
that we lost her father!

657
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:50,132
Ea-Easy. Steady. Ev-Everyone.
Just...

658
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:52,576
even with full power, it would
have ended this way.

659
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:56,496
They call it the
widow-maker for a reason.

660
00:31:58,325 --> 00:32:03,128
Leela... stop cardiac massage.

661
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,435
Time of death: 16:04.

662
00:32:57,459 --> 00:33:00,227
Hello?

663
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,991
Hello? Hello?

664
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:29,655
Somebody help.

665
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,920
Help me.

666
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,499
I'm almost done
updating the exploit.

667
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:41,852
We'll stall them
as long as possible.

668
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,094
</i>
<i> Time is up.</i>

669
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:44,929
<i> -Where's our money?</i>
Good news.

670
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:46,931
The bank has released the funds.

671
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:49,026
The entire board is here

672
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:52,103
to witness this transfer.
It will be done.

673
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:55,423
However, the crypto exchange
you directed us to

674
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:57,183
has flagged the transaction but

675
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:58,518
says it should be approved

676
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
-momentarily.
<i> -You are lying.</i>

677
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:02,539
<i> All of your data</i>
<i> will be destroyed.</i>

678
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,992
Please, we're almost there.
You'll have all...

679
00:34:06,787 --> 00:34:08,712
...all of your money very soon.

680
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,505
Be patient.

681
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,054
It's done.

682
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:20,965
I'll send proof of payment now.

683
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:25,303
Hello, fellas.

684
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:28,381
So, which one of you is Russian?

685
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:31,293
Because your IP address says
you're in Baltimore.

686
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:33,478
Oh, I wouldn't bother fleeing.

687
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,739
The FBI are on their way
to greet you.

688
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,390
Log out, log out.

689
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:45,165
Yes!

690
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,758
My heart is breaking
for this girl.

691
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,986
Mine, too.

692
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,448
Life hangs
by such a fragile thread, man.

693
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,617
One minute, I'm talking to him,
and then, the next...

694
00:35:21,603 --> 00:35:23,769
You know what?
I'm the one telling people

695
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:26,439
not to get emotionally involved,

696
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:29,275
but Esty--

697
00:35:29,277 --> 00:35:31,795
she's a special girl, man.

698
00:35:32,856 --> 00:35:35,039
And her father will not
see her...

699
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,875
graduate.

700
00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:40,095
He won't
walk her down the aisle.

701
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:44,957
You know, you did everything
humanly possible.

702
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:48,052
The-the man had a time bomb
in his chest.

703
00:35:48,054 --> 00:35:51,039
Yeah, we could have
lost them both.

704
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,374
We almost did.

705
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:56,060
You know, the silver lining
for Esty is

706
00:35:56,062 --> 00:35:58,213
that Conrad diagnosed
her Brugada.

707
00:35:58,215 --> 00:36:00,715
And when she recovers,
she'll get a defibrillator.

708
00:36:00,717 --> 00:36:02,826
And without that,
she would have died young

709
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,661
like her father
and her grandfather.

710
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,555
But she's gonna be alone, Bell.

711
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:09,574
Well, her father mentioned
Esty's mother.

712
00:36:09,576 --> 00:36:11,743
She left
shortly after Esty's birth.

713
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:14,913
So I had our social workers
reach out to them.

714
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:17,399
They're working hard
to find her.

715
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:18,917
'Cause, yeah, maybe they will.

716
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:20,660
The woman left Esty already.

717
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:22,846
There's no way she's gonna
love her the way Ronan did.

718
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,015
Well, I have hope.

719
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:29,227
It's hard not
to love a child like Esty.

720
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,099
She has an uncle.

721
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:38,987
Her father listed his brother
as next of kin.

722
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,531
I'll call him.

723
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,159
He should be here
when you tell her.

724
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,957
I have to pick up my daughter.

725
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,392
Yeah. Oh, they're very nice.

726
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,394
-Can I borrow those?
Wow.

727
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,621
She's gorgeous.
The nursery called me.

728
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:15,715
Grandpa to the rescue.

729
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:19,885
Incredible job, man,
jerry-rigging that OR.

730
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:21,963
Yeah, well, it takes a village.

731
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:23,314
And luckily, we have one.

732
00:37:23,316 --> 00:37:24,983
That's not all Devon did.

733
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:28,227
His, uh, buddy Jessie,
a gray-hat hacker,

734
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:30,080
beat the attackers
at their own game.

735
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:33,992
Yeah, we got them on camera.
Now the FBI can track them down.

736
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,901
All systems are secure
and back online.

737
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:39,965
The hospital power has been
restored, including the ORs.

738
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:45,503
-You know what a lucky man

739
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:48,080
-you are to have
this little one?

740
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:51,601
Yes, I'm aware
of exactly how lucky I am.

741
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,980
Never more than at this moment.

742
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,671
I have to go sign out
my last few patients.

743
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,859
-I'll wait for you.
-No.

744
00:38:24,861 --> 00:38:27,028
No, you go on home.

745
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,548
I'll go to my place,
you go to yours.

746
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:33,384
-We'll sleep.

747
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:35,386
Something we don't do a lot of

748
00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:37,981
when we spend the night
together.

749
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,226
And... we can

750
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:45,547
talk about moving in together

751
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:48,491
over coffee
tomorrow morning, okay?

752
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,995
Okay.

753
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:57,459
I'll see you.

754
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:05,825
Hey, guys, get out of here.
Next shift is coming.

755
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:07,919
Yeah, fine. No argument there.

756
00:39:07,921 --> 00:39:10,680
We're getting a beer.
Come along.

757
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,183
-You're buying.

758
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,580
We must get hammered.

759
00:39:18,582 --> 00:39:22,150
Um, not yet.
I'm almost finished.

760
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,197
Hey, I don't see
that Winston ever checked out.

761
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,774
Did-did he get his cast?

762
00:39:29,776 --> 00:39:32,202
Nolan took him down there.

763
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:36,039
Yup, took him there in person,
safe and sound.

764
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,859
He must have left
without signing out.

765
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:42,295
You can check on him tomorrow.

766
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:46,532
Hey, Shelly,

767
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:48,126
I'm gonna go down

768
00:39:48,128 --> 00:39:50,720
and check on my patient
Winston Robards, okay?

769
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:13,660
Hello? Hello?

770
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,818
Winston.

771
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,504
Winston? Winston?

772
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:35,598
Hey, Winston?
Wake up, buddy. Come on.

773
00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:40,603
Hey, can I get some help
in here?

774
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,606
Winston?

775
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:51,506
You know, apart from work,
I spend 90% of my time alone.

776
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:53,191
Me, too.

777
00:40:53,193 --> 00:40:56,194
Tonight I just especially
am kind of feeling it.

778
00:40:56,196 --> 00:40:58,103
-Yeah.
-Hey, do you...?

779
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:00,331
Do you want to get a bite?

780
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:05,128
That's really, really sweet, but

781
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,130
-I am just whipped, and...
-Yeah, of course you are.

782
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,691
That's... No, that's, uh...
Forget I asked. It's, uh...

783
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:12,343
You know, it's not like
I meant anything by it.

784
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,288
-Good night.
-Night. Good night.

785
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:27,375
Till tomorrow.
