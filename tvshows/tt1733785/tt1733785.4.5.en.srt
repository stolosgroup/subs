PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:07,160
Stoning. Electricity. Poison.

3
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:12,427
- All three are execution methods.
- How many different methods are there?

4
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:15,840
The three on the board, shooting,
hanging, gas, and decapitation.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,720
So there's four left.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,129
- Where was your car on the 28th?
- In the shop.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,960
- Where were you?
- In Hamburg with my wife.

8
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:30,120
- Didn't you know the lady who was stoned?
- I knew who she was, but that's it.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,880
The poison that killed Leonora
probably came from a cone snail.

11
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:51,600
They disappeared almost 8 years ago.
I'm wondering, should I put it behind me?

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,760
Good to hear you speak.
Really.

13
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:59,100
- I'm pregnant.
- And I'm the father?

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,647
I've only had sex with myself and you
the last two years.

15
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,440
I think we've found new houseguests.
They have it really bad.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,021
We have newcomers here.

17
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:15,721
Is that you, Frank?

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,876
Hi, Sofie.

19
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:22,676
EPISODE 5

20
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:31,360
Did you really think you could hide here?
Sofie, for fuck's sake...

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,040
It works for a little while,
but I find you every time.

22
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,225
Come on.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,377
Can't you just go?

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,080
Wouldn't you like that?
Then you could be with your guy there.

25
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,480
He helped me and Christoffer.
That's all.

26
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:54,680
He's a good person.
Everyone here is a good person.

27
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,259
Come on.

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,800
Sofie...

29
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,800
Stop forcing me to hurt you.

30
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:07,944
Come on.

31
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:16,600
- Hey, Sofie.
- Hey.

32
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:22,560
- How are you?
- Good. This is Dan Brolund, a friend.

33
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:25,968
- Harriet.
- Hi, Dan.

34
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,535
- Come on.
- Do you have a minute?

35
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:34,360
We're helping Andersson this weekend.
What task would you like?

36
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:38,480
- Can we talk later? We're a little busy.
- Yes, but it'll only take a minute.

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,800
Didn't you understand?
We don't have time, okay?

38
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:44,533
We take care of each other here,
Dan Brolund.

39
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:48,700
But if we need the police,
we call them.

40
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,920
I know where you live,
and I'm coming back, okay?

41
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,625
Look over there.

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
Hey.

43
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:22,760
What the hell are you doing
with my son?

44
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,844
- Just go. You shouldn't be here.
- Come, Christoffer. Come.

45
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,200
Leave the kid in peace.
Get out of here.

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,322
He's not your fucking kid.

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Okay.

48
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,760
- Don't do anything dumb.
- Leave my family alone. Understand?

49
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,567
Do you understand?

50
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,115
- Stay far away from my family!
- Dad!

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,528
Leave him alone.

52
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:57,820
Christoffer, it's people like him
who destroy things with you, me, and Mom.

53
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:02,520
Come on, let's go home
and get Mom.

54
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,189
Christoffer...

55
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,619
Christoffer, it's going to be okay.

56
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,200
It's going to be okay.
It was an accident.

57
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:39,409
I'll take care of it.

58
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:47,163
THE BRIDGE IV

59
00:05:55,983 --> 00:06:00,160
Is it true that sharks die
if they stop swimming?

60
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:05,960
Most of them sink because
they don't have swim bladders.

61
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,280
So they die if they stop swimming.

62
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,480
If they stop breathing,
then they stop swimming.

63
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
- And then they die.
- If they don't start swimming again.

64
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:22,440
Hi. Lene Jensen.
You wanted to talk to me?

65
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

66
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,200
Conus geographus.
It's not a snail people keep at home.

67
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,680
Cone snails' toxins can be deadly,
and it eats fish.

68
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,240
- We know. Do you have any here?
- Yes, we do. A couple.

69
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:43,080
Then we need a list of all personnel
who have access to them.

70
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,920
If people have them at home,
could we find out who they are?

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,598
You don't have to register them,
if that's what you mean.

72
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:52,240
- They're used in pharmaceuticals.
- Yes, they are.

73
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,280
Do you know where the closest lab is?

74
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:58,720
There aren't any in Denmark.
Not in Sweden, either.

75
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
I didn't ask where they weren't.
I asked where the closest lab is.

76
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,040
In Germany, as far as I know.
Hamburg.

77
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:13,120
I delivered to Sweden.

78
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:19,320
- The goods were stolen.
- Are you talking about the weapons now?

79
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:28,080
I figured it was Dimitri.
Dimitri Vassilij.

80
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,965
I shot his right-hand man.

81
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:34,947
You're confessing to some serious crimes.

82
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:39,360
I want to find the fucker
who killed Leonora.

83
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,836
You were the one who killed Leonora.

84
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,490
He's going to die.

85
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:52,560
No matter what you do to protect him,
where you put him...

86
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,040
He's going to die.

87
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,394
We just need to find him first, eh?

88
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,776
Do you recognize any of those people?

89
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:19,254
Dan. Dan Brolund.

90
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:23,924
Is it him?

91
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:28,240
Dan Brolund drove cocaine
for William Ramberg in the early 2000s.

92
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,410
Did nine months for it.

93
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,120
William stopped working with him
when the weapons were stolen.

94
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,520
So Dan Brolund also has a connection
to two of the victims.

95
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,160
It seems a bit random that he drove
Margrethe Thormod to the gay bar, no?

96
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,755
Maybe.

97
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:48,754
Forensics confirms Margrethe Thormod's
hair was found in Morgan's car.

98
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,040
And Margrethe Thormod knew
Malene Sonning.

99
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,400
Yeah, but the Sonnings' Hamburg trip
hasn't been confirmed yet, right?

100
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,880
No, but if they were, that's where
poison from the cone snail is extracted.

101
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,400
There you are.

102
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:08,720
You knew Margrethe Thormod.

103
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:14,560
Knew...
We were part of the same organization.

104
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:19,362
- How was your relationship?
- We didn't have a relationship.

105
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:23,280
- She wasn't after your role as Chairman?
- Where'd you hear that?

106
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,416
Just answer the question.

107
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:33,200
We had different views on
how we could make a difference.

108
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:35,533
So she wanted to be Chairman.

109
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:39,480
- Can someone interpret the direction...
- Sorry for interrupting.

110
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:42,256
But if I understand this correctly -

111
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:47,480
the murder of Thormod is linked to
the murders of Dahlqvist and Ramberg.

112
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,480
What were my client's motives
for killing them?

113
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,840
- We can't get into that now.
- No, because you have no motive.

114
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
The only thing you have is a car that
neither my client nor her husband drove.

115
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,120
- Because they claim they were in Hamburg.
- Here are the tickets from Hamburg.

116
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:04,920
With the date, as you can see.

117
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:09,880
We need the original files
to confirm the date.

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,997
While you verify the details,
I expect my client has permission to go.

119
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:18,613
You don't think it seems strange?

120
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:22,640
- You don't need to answer that.
- I have no comment.

121
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,840
I talked to all of the men
who worked with Alice.

122
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:43,840
None of them saw her
outside of work -

123
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,470
and she didn't talk to any of them
about problems at home.

124
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:50,160
- You believe them?
- Yes.

125
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,240
And I can't prove they're lying.

126
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,680
We need to put it ad acta.
I'm not getting anywhere.

127
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:04,520
You tried.
That's how it is.

128
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,920
I just need to live with it.

129
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:10,200
Oh, there you are.

130
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:16,840
Morgan's alibi from when Patrik died
and when the clown was at the hospital.

131
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:20,680
The Sonnings are each other's alibis
for all three killings.

132
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,960
- It's enough to release him, apparently.
- Did he say anything else?

133
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,120
The usual. Hamburg, car at the shop,
curious when the gay guy called.

134
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,600
His name was Taariq. Taariq Shirazi.
Is that so fucking difficult?

135
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:40,538
When Taariq called, okay?

136
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:45,040
Here are the tickets from Hamburg.
They need to be verified.

137
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,520
If they were in Hamburg,
who drove Morgan's car?

138
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:17,400
- Fun to drive, huh?
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

139
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:21,347
- Have you tried?
- No, I want to keep my job.

140
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:25,821
Let me know if you change your mind.
I'd like some company.

141
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:38,160
What are you doing?

142
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,640
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you at home?

143
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,000
They called. I had to meet a customer.
What are you doing?

144
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:51,442
- I borrowed a car.
- You have a car.

145
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, but I borrowed a car
that's fun to drive to unwind a bit.

146
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:59,720
- How did you get into the cabinet?
- Are you serious?

147
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:02,680
2330.
You use the same code for everything.

148
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:06,240
Hey. It's not the end of the world, is it?

149
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,108
What if something happened?

150
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,680
Well, it never has.

151
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,880
- You did this before?
- Oh, stop it.

152
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,423
Okay?

153
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:21,560
Come on.
We need to shop for the party.

154
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:24,967
Come on.

155
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,240
- What's that?
- Prunes.

156
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:38,480
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

157
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,200
It is something you're having
because you're pregnant?

158
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:48,040
No, I'm constipated.

159
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,720
Oh, okay.

160
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,240
My breasts are bigger, too.
Have you noticed?

161
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:58,640
They are. The nipples, too.

162
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,666
No, I hadn't noticed.

163
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,920
I thought about what you said.
Your proposal.

164
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,480
I'd like to have it.
I'd like to have the baby.

165
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,200
Okay. Good.

166
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
You said you wanted
nothing to do with it -

167
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,840
but we can still see each other, right?

168
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,640
If you can find
a babysitter sometimes.

169
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,406
Yeah, I can.

170
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:15,360
Christoffer.

171
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:18,120
Christoffer.

172
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,552
Christoffer!

173
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
Come on. Let's go.

174
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,840
- We can still call the police.
- We moved the body.

175
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,680
- It was an accident.
- Yes, it was.

176
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,680
But they won't believe that
after everything he's done.

177
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,880
I understand it was terrible for you,
but it wasn't your fault.

178
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:54,400
You can't forget that.
It wasn't your fault.

179
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:02,840
You can't say anything.

180
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:07,720
Especially not to your mother.
Understand?

181
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,520
We need to say something.

182
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:13,920
Okay.

183
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:18,800
Say that we met him,
and I threatened him with the gun -

184
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:23,520
and said it would be really, really bad
if he came back.

185
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:30,240
Christoffer.
Christoffer.

186
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,440
Look at me.

187
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:38,840
If this gets out, I can't protect
you anymore. Understand?

188
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,760
We met him, I threatened him -

189
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,320
and I said it would be really bad
if he came back.

190
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:54,200
You can do this.
You're strong.

191
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,560
Dan was here. He knows where we live.
We need to move.

192
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:15,720
I'm so sorry, love,
but we're not safe here.

193
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,320
He's not coming back.
Frank took care of it.

194
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:25,240
We met him in the forest,
and Frank threatened him and said -

195
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,000
it would be really bad
if he came back.

196
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,120
We're safe here, Mom.

197
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:39,240
He's not coming back.

198
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:43,560
We don't have any more questions now,
but we might come back.

199
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:03,040
- What did they want?
- It was about my brother's car again.

200
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,560
- But they already asked you about that.
- Yeah.

201
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:10,400
- What did you say, then?
- That the keys were locked up.

202
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,440
- And that we were at the hospital.
- Yeah, exactly.

203
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,880
Yeah, right.

204
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
What?

205
00:18:20,951 --> 00:18:22,834
No, nothing.

206
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:41,680
I want you to make a list.

207
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:43,920
Of what?

208
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:48,640
Of the people who have
affected you the most.

209
00:18:49,978 --> 00:18:53,520
- Affected how?
- In all ways. Positive and negative.

210
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:56,800
Those who have had
the greatest influence on your life.

211
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,640
Who made you into who you are.

212
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,040
It's not just people who have made me
into who I am. There's many other factors.

213
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,640
I know that, but I'd like you
to make a list anyway.

214
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:22,920
Have you had any more panic attacks?

215
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,979
No, but I'm still sleeping badly.

216
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,040
I can make sure you get
something calming to help you.

217
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,360
No, I'm in week 7. I don't want
to expose the fetus to any risks.

218
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,280
- You're pregnant?
- Yes, with my colleague, Henrik.

219
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:46,800
Then you have another name
for the list.

220
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
What's up?

221
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:33,818
Hi, Henrik. It's me.

222
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,920
- Hello? It's Kevin.
<i>- Kevin?</i>

223
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,160
- Hey.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

224
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:50,200
<i>- Are you at a party?</i>
- No, I'm just out at a bar.

225
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:55,080
I've had a little to drink.
I think I need something stronger.

226
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,868
Kevin, don't do that, man.
Where are you?

227
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:02,924
<i>- Just by the station.</i>
- I'm coming now. Don't touch anything.

228
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:25,360
My father died 4 years ago today.

229
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm sorry.

230
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:38,800
He gave me my first joint when
I turned 17. He said it was time.

231
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,520
Okay.

232
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,320
This...

233
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:53,240
We were going to see them
at Old Trafford.

234
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,320
It never happened.

235
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:58,760
He died, and...

236
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:04,640
Yeah, then I started using drugs more.

237
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:08,920
Until finally I thought
I could fly from a balcony.

238
00:22:09,402 --> 00:22:11,440
It didn't go so well.

239
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,440
He was really good at promising things.
People trusted him.

240
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,960
Everyone really liked him,
even if he was really a piece of shit.

241
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:30,080
But he was still my dad.

242
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
Thanks for coming.

243
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:39,400
I didn't have anyone else to call.

244
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,000
All you need to do is call.

245
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:06,880
We can't stay. We need to go now.
He's coming back.

246
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:11,360
- No, Mom, he's not coming back.
- He will. He never gives up.

247
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,320
Understand?
I'm so fucking sorry, Christoffer -

248
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,280
but we have to leave.
That's how it is.

249
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,680
Fucking listen to what I'm saying!
He's going to kill us!

250
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,160
He's never coming back.
I shot him.

251
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:34,160
In the forest, Mom. It was an accident.
I tripped.

252
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,240
Is he...
Is he dead?

253
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,080
It was an accident.

254
00:23:51,184 --> 00:23:53,640
An accident...

255
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,480
Of course it was.

256
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:05,760
You can't tell Frank you know.

257
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,040
No, no.
Come here.

258
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:13,922
I understand.

259
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,200
- You come here?
- Yes.

260
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,880
I made a list of people who have been
important in my life.

261
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:44,560
Hans meant a lot to me.

262
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:49,000
Most of the people who meant a lot to me
either died -

263
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,600
or left.

264
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:58,274
You have Henrik.
You're good for each other.

265
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:05,040
- How do you know that?
- I can see it.

266
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,120
I see.

267
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:14,000
Take care of what you have.
It can end so quickly.

268
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:26,240
But I think Henrik means more to you
than you might understand.

269
00:25:29,082 --> 00:25:30,496
Goodnight.

270
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:31,280
- Hi. You're here?
- Unfortunately.

271
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:36,360
- How close are you to an arrest?
- Not especially close.

272
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:41,080
- They're keeping an eye on you.
- Aren't they always?

273
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:44,960
More now. It looks like everything
is being leaked out of here.

274
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:49,720
- You can't afford any more mistakes.
- I didn't know I'd made any.

275
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,295
Taariq Shirazi was released.

276
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:56,760
Because we thought he knew more
than he told us. We were right.

277
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,640
- He shot himself.
- Because of the threat of deportation.

278
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,880
Two homeless girls lived
in the home of your detective.

279
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:09,240
- Who said that?
- Did it not happen?

280
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:12,880
We had a choice between
a safe environment or the jail.

281
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:15,161
We could've been criticized for that, too.

282
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:19,366
I'm on your side, but that's not enough
if you don't take control of this.

283
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:35,760
- I'd like to ask for your help.
- Okay.

284
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:40,440
I want you to check these numbers.

285
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:47,240
- One of these numbers is Jonas'.
- They're all Jonas'.

286
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,840
I want to know who he calls.
Texts, Skype, everything.

287
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:54,160
And he can't know anything,
but you know that.

288
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,520
- Do you really want to run the risk?
- I need to.

289
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,240
- This doesn't feel right, Lillian.
- It's an order.

290
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:20,080
Are you sure it's not too early?

291
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Yeah, it's fine.
It'll be good to get started again.

292
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:28,314
- Only if you can handle it.
- Of course I can handle it.

293
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:01,200
Thanks.

294
00:29:18,014 --> 00:29:21,840
Okay, my name is Niels Thormod,
and I'm a psychologist.

295
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:25,400
- I'm here to help you.
- With what? Getting us out of here?

296
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,080
I understand you want that.

297
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,600
You can't just lock us up.
We haven't fucking done shit.

298
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:36,800
- Can you tell me your names?
- We want to talk to Henrik the policeman.

299
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,245
If I'm going to help you,
you need to tell me your names.

300
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:44,080
Did you not hear me?
We want to talk to Henrik.

301
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,560
- Can you not talk to me?
- We're not saying shit.

302
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:51,886
We need to talk to Henrik.

303
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:06,200
- When did you get in yesterday?
- Late.

304
00:30:10,156 --> 00:30:13,360
- Did you sleep?
- A little.

305
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:18,560
What's that?

306
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:24,320
It's a list for you of food
that could negatively affect the fetus.

307
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:28,080
- You're going to eat here more often?
- Yes, you're good at cooking.

308
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,320
- But you're looking for your own place?
- Not at the moment.

309
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,920
So you're going to live here?

310
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:42,800
Yes.

311
00:30:43,023 --> 00:30:46,880
But you need realistic expectations.
I'm not good at it.

312
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,753
Then it's going to go well.

313
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:53,402
I tried to live with someone before.
It was a failure.

314
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,898
But that wasn't with me.

315
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,600
Henrik Sabroe.

316
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:06,592
Okay, I'm coming.

317
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:11,680
I need to run.
See you there.

318
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:45,200
We're sorry we took your things.

319
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:48,200
We liked you, so it was dumb.

320
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,480
Where are the necklaces? One had a heart
and one had a handprint.

321
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,880
- We sold them.
- Great. Bye, then.

322
00:31:59,287 --> 00:32:03,440
Wait! We saw him.
My sister saw him.

323
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,800
The guy we took the phone from.
The murderer.

324
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Is that true?

325
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,560
Try with a little longer hair.

326
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,840
- You said it was dark, right?
- Yep. Dark.

327
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,389
Brown eyes.

328
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,760
Try to bring them closer together.

329
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,440
I need to run. Can we get it
as soon as it's ready?

330
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,160
Are you coming back?

331
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,040
Maybe.

332
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,720
Try to make the nose a little bigger.

333
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,080
They saw the car here yesterday. When it
was still here, they called the police.

334
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,760
- Is that Dan Brolund's taxi?
- Yes.

335
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,000
No signs of violence either
inside or outside of the car.

336
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,717
What was he doing in this area?

337
00:33:15,574 --> 00:33:18,280
There's a town out here.

338
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,840
You can go.

339
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,000
He was here yesterday. He threatened
and tried to kidnap his ex-wife.

340
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,720
He was very unpleasant
when I met him.

341
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,720
- Who's the ex-wife?
- Sofie Björk.

342
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,848
She and her son have lived here
since a week ago.

343
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:06,880
- Did you report the kidnap attempt?
- I didn't.

344
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,360
- What Sofie did, I don't know.
- Why didn't you report it?

345
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:18,320
We try to take care of ourselves
without outside interference.

346
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,880
- We?
- In the town. My town.

347
00:34:23,336 --> 00:34:26,708
- Is it your town?
- Yeah. I decide who lives here.

348
00:34:26,788 --> 00:34:28,748
And who can live here, then?

349
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,160
Good people. Honest, helpful,
understanding, empathetic.

350
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,806
So you're trying to create an ideal
community? A utopia will never work.

351
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:41,160
You don't believe in the good in people?

352
00:34:41,508 --> 00:34:46,280
I don't think anyone is completely good,
if goodness can be defined.

353
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,280
Mankind's longing for the perfect life
has never been realized.

354
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:55,760
- You mean we should stop trying?
- No, but you won't succeed.

355
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,911
If we can put the philosophy aside,
we'd like to hear more about Dan Brolund.

356
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:11,160
- The police are here. At Harriet's.
- For Dan?

357
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,440
- They found his taxi abandoned nearby.
- I can't do this.

358
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,720
Can't we just tell them?

359
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,903
That we didn't mean to.

360
00:35:20,403 --> 00:35:23,640
No, we talked about that.
Why would they believe it?

361
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,480
He abused you for years.

362
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,040
Think about the consequences.
You're 17 and legally responsible.

363
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,038
You're all Sofie has.

364
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:36,136
Go somewhere. Stay there.

365
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:39,067
I'll fix this. I'll help you.

366
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:41,885
Okay. Thanks, Frank.

367
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,480
- This is Frank.
- Frank Wahlgren. Hi.

368
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:07,409
I helped Sofie with everything
that's happened.

369
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:11,298
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
This is Henrik Sabroe.

370
00:36:11,442 --> 00:36:15,251
- Sabroe? And Norén?
- Yes.

371
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:19,440
Will you come in?
Do you want some coffee?

372
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,514
- No.
- Yeah, I'd love some.

373
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:27,640
But then Harriet stopped us
in the driveway -

374
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,178
and then he left.
I haven't seen him since.

375
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,367
It doesn't look like he went back
to the taxi.

376
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,840
- So no one's seen him since.
- No.

377
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:44,367
Are you sure you haven't seen
any of them before?

378
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:46,160
Maybe together with him?

379
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:54,920
I think I recognize him.

380
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,600
From where?

381
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,120
I think he drives taxis.

382
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,120
Thanks.

383
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,160
For not saying anything
about Christoffer.

384
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,880
Christoffer told me
that you met Dan.

385
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,040
- What else did he say?
- Nothing.

386
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,707
He said you scared him away.

387
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,159
What if he comes back?

388
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,726
We'll worry about that then.

389
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,094
Christoffer.

390
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:47,148
Are you crying?

391
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:54,800
Because of my father.

392
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,760
What about him?

393
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:07,600
The first time he hit me,
I was three.

394
00:38:07,991 --> 00:38:11,440
I can't remember it,
but my mom told me.

395
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:25,520
It was so nice
when he was in prison.

396
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:28,178
I used to wish he never get out.

397
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,560
Is that why you never talk about him?

398
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,639
- Because he was in prison?
- Among other things.

399
00:38:39,956 --> 00:38:42,039
Has your father ever hit you?

400
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:45,612
No. He's good.

401
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,673
He does his best.

402
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:52,520
What do you mean?

403
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,320
Nothing.
He's good.

404
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,080
But it hasn't always been easy for him.

405
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:04,120
Or for us.

406
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,000
Because of your mother?
You never talk about her either.

407
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,840
Among other things.

408
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,499
I like you.

409
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,988
I like you, too.

410
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,040
Oops.

411
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,840
Speaking of Dan...

412
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,240
I thought that...

413
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:58,360
Wouldn't it be just as nice
if you moved into my house?

414
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,640
We have lots of space.
You can each have a room.

415
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,597
Christoffer and Astrid are friends.
It will be safer for you.

416
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:12,000
Theo's son can take this,
so we can resolve that.

417
00:40:15,174 --> 00:40:16,450
Yeah...

418
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:23,001
Know what? Forget it.
If you don't want to, then...

419
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,680
I just want to help you, but if you
don't want my help anymore...

420
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,986
It's not like that, Frank.

421
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,880
If you want to live in the house
I got you, you should.

422
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,480
You know best.

423
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,120
Wait.

424
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:45,140
We'll do it.

425
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,650
We'll move into your house.

426
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:52,922
Okay. Good.

427
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,520
- I saw the cake.
- Yeah, it's super cool, don't you think?

428
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,560
- It's in the shape of a baby.
- Yeah, I know that.

429
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,560
I sent Lotte a picture.

430
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,129
I thought she would put it on top -

431
00:41:10,209 --> 00:41:14,480
but then she made
a whole baby cake instead.

432
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,315
It'll be like we're eating our child.

433
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:22,160
It's just a cake, Tobias. No?

434
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,480
- Did you get the balloons?
- Knock, knock!

435
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,644
Hi. We came a little earlier,
if you need our help with anything.

436
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:35,320
Wow. There's not much space,
but if there were, you'd have used it.

437
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,720
We're so excited about the name
you chose for the little one.

438
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:45,960
He's so sweet.
He'll be a real charmer with those eyes.

439
00:41:46,524 --> 00:41:51,760
- Is there anything we can help with?
- I have a lots of balloons to blow up.

440
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,560
You can just pick him up if you want.

441
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:57,848
No, thanks.

442
00:42:01,626 --> 00:42:04,440
There's something we need to talk about.

443
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,358
<i>Hello?</i>

444
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,720
- Hi, my dear.
- Hi, Mom.

445
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,520
I'm so glad you came.
Tobias?

446
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,920
- Can you come down here and help?
- Coming.

447
00:42:31,202 --> 00:42:35,040
- Is that him?
- According to the pickpockets, yeah.

448
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:40,620
Morgan Sonning?
It could definitely be Morgan Sonning.

449
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,320
Maybe, but we need more
if we're going to take him in.

450
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:48,120
- Where's Saga?
- In Malmo. She had something to do.

451
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,368
So what do we do with him?
Do we announce it?

452
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:55,197
No, we'll just get a lot of useless tips
that take time and focus.

453
00:42:56,126 --> 00:43:00,800
But what if he kills again?
That wouldn't look good, would it?

454
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:06,000
No, because everything we investigate
ends up in the press.

455
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,920
- So what do we do?
- We wait.

456
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,800
Lillian. Hi.

457
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,501
Sorry to disturb. You're busy.
The other night...

458
00:43:21,581 --> 00:43:27,120
- Yeah, I can explain.
- No need. Restaurant, white tablecloths.

459
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,320
It was really date-like.
I understand that.

460
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:35,520
- Have you eaten lunch?
- No.

461
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,440
- Do you eat lunch?
- Yeah.

462
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,427
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

463
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:45,638
- Here you are.
- Thanks. And the money.

464
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,730
- Do you want ketchup?
- Yeah, thanks.

465
00:43:49,764 --> 00:43:52,440
How's it going
in the prosecutor's office?

466
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,360
The mood's a little tense.

467
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,901
You know my colleague Vibeke?
You know how much she likes her horse.

468
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,560
It is the same one she had
a couple years ago? Nicki?

469
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,440
I can remember when it
was having surgery.

470
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,760
Vibeke chose to be there
when it woke up -

471
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,880
instead of her husband's
50th birthday party.

472
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,263
Then they got divorced, so...

473
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,960
Anyway, some idiots gassed it last night.

474
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,640
- The horse.
- Gassed?

475
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:29,960
They sent a video
showing how they did it.

476
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:35,233
Is it okay if we take this back?

477
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,680
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.

478
00:44:43,334 --> 00:44:45,360
There we are.

479
00:44:45,815 --> 00:44:47,080
You get a little foot.

480
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,880
There you are.

481
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,044
I got a foot!

482
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,767
Sonny Tybolt Johansson.
Didn't you talk about those Y names?

483
00:45:04,847 --> 00:45:09,951
- It's not so easy. Think about her ex.
- The kid's going to be in the special class.

484
00:45:10,031 --> 00:45:15,000
- It's different with Y names in Denmark.
- You should move there.

485
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,589
Oh, for fuck's sake.

486
00:45:31,316 --> 00:45:34,680
- You weren't invited.
- I didn't want to be.

487
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,940
Then why the hell are you here?

488
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,360
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Grandma.

489
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:43,800
I just came to see if it was true.
That you don't give a shit about my son.

490
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,800
I've moved on.
Like normal people do.

491
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,160
You're not a normal person at all.
You're a cheap little whore.

492
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:55,400
- Then fuck the hell off.
- Don't touch me!

493
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:57,720
Don't touch me.

494
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:03,073
Bye, Solveig.
Goodbye, Solveig.

495
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,918
Dead pixels.

496
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:50,110
The same place as the clown video.
It's filmed with the same camera.

497
00:46:50,278 --> 00:46:52,611
Why didn't he send a video
of the first two murders?

498
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:55,594
- Are we sure he didn't do it?
- Not that we know.

499
00:46:55,674 --> 00:46:58,115
- Just check again.
- What happened?

500
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:01,000
We got another video.
A horse that was gassed.

501
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,680
- A horse?
- Yeah.

502
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,440
Look here. There's some extra frames
before the film starts.

503
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,520
Try to go back and pause.

504
00:47:14,754 --> 00:47:19,760
Morgan Sonning has that watch.
It's identical.

505
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:23,520
- Is it enough? Can we take him in?
- Yeah.

506
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:27,557
- Hey.
- Hey.

507
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:37,720
This isn't so fun anymore.
I'm not saying shit without my lawyer.

508
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:41,880
Okay.

509
00:47:47,004 --> 00:47:49,280
Sit down, thanks.

510
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:01,480
Okay.
What the hell do you want to know?

511
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,960
This is you.

512
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,840
- Yeah, it could be. So what?
- The camera that took those photos...

513
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,960
HERO4 Silver Edition. 4000 kroner.

514
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,560
- Where is it now?
- Don't you have it?

515
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,120
It was in the car.

516
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,440
- The car that picked up Thormod?
- Yeah. My Audi.

517
00:48:29,669 --> 00:48:32,080
That was lucky for you, huh?

518
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,000
- You haven't missed the camera?
- No, not especially.

519
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,040
But like I said,
I thought you had it.

520
00:48:40,632 --> 00:48:42,359
Was there anything else?

521
00:48:49,305 --> 00:48:51,400
Do you have a couple minutes?

522
00:48:58,026 --> 00:49:00,336
Can I go now, or?

523
00:49:00,636 --> 00:49:04,986
We restored some files from the spam
filter on Richard Dahlqvist's computer.

524
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:12,212
<i>Go! Hello? Get out!</i>

525
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,811
The same dead pixels.

526
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,480
- Did Thormod get a video too?
- Jonas is over there now.

527
00:49:30,855 --> 00:49:34,000
- How's it going with Sonning?
- He said the camera was in the Audi.

528
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:38,720
But he can stay a bit longer.
I need to check something out.

529
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:51,531
They can't see you,
but you can see them.

530
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,513
Good.

531
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:02,160
Take a good look and see if you stole
the phone from any of those men.

532
00:50:04,814 --> 00:50:06,184
I don't know.

533
00:50:09,054 --> 00:50:11,440
Take a good look at them.

534
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:22,240
No. No, no. Don't look at your sister.
Look at those men.

535
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:24,723
Do you recognize any of them?

536
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:28,794
I didn't see him at all.

537
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:35,360
We just made it up.
We wanted to go home with you.

538
00:50:35,972 --> 00:50:37,254
I'm sorry.

539
00:50:38,504 --> 00:50:42,298
Do you understand there's five men
sitting in jail because of you?

540
00:50:42,429 --> 00:50:43,724
Out. Out!

541
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:47,920
- What's going on?
- Just get out. Both of you. Out.

542
00:50:49,518 --> 00:50:54,800
If they want to contact us again,
don't call me, okay? Get out.

543
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:01,709
Okay, what do we have to work with?

544
00:51:02,787 --> 00:51:07,955
Hamburg Police are examining the tickets,
but it looks like they were really there.

545
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,349
We have the poison from that snail.

546
00:51:11,904 --> 00:51:13,455
Impossible to trace.

547
00:51:14,454 --> 00:51:18,027
The workers at The National Aquarium
have no connection to the case.

548
00:51:18,107 --> 00:51:20,648
So that doesn't need to be there.

549
00:51:21,049 --> 00:51:22,807
And we can forget him, too.

550
00:51:23,302 --> 00:51:26,568
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Bad day.

551
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,980
We need to shift focus to the horse.

552
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,277
The horse was clearly directed
against Vibeke -

553
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:42,800
exactly like Leonora
was against William.

554
00:51:43,484 --> 00:51:46,400
So the victims aren't victims.

555
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:51,760
It's those closest to them that suffer.
That's why they get a film.

556
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:59,160
Niels Thormod. Richard Dahlqvist.
William Ramberg.

557
00:51:59,597 --> 00:52:01,640
Vibeke Jacobsen.

558
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,880
There must be a connection
between them.

559
00:52:08,438 --> 00:52:10,703
Yeah, that was damn good.

560
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,896
Then we know where to start tomorrow.

561
00:52:25,444 --> 00:52:26,714
What's wrong?

562
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:31,440
- What?
- Cramps.

563
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:33,200
In your stomach?

564
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:35,937
Is it something with the baby?

565
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,640
Shouldn't we just check it out?
Just to be safe.

566
00:52:43,302 --> 00:52:45,040
I had an abortion.

567
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,320
Early today, when I was in Malmo.
That's why.

568
00:52:58,204 --> 00:52:59,880
Henrik?

569
00:53:00,835 --> 00:53:02,205
Henrik!

570
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:59,400
I understood from your reaction that
maybe I should explain myself.

571
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,160
I did it so we could be together.

572
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,320
I can't be here
if there's a child here.

573
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:12,000
You know I can't.
And I want to be with you.

574
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:15,848
What the fuck are you thinking?

575
00:54:17,735 --> 00:54:19,975
What I just said.

576
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:25,120
Do you really think
I want to be with you now?

577
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,400
It seemed like it, I thought.

578
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,760
- Before you killed my baby.
- It wasn't a baby.

579
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,360
An embryo. Call it whatever you want.
Get out. I don't want to look at you.

580
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,360
- But I thought you'd understand.
- Understand what?

581
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,720
You don't fucking know me at all.
Come on, get out.

582
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:49,800
When one is in love, the brain's reward
system releases neurotransmitters -

583
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,007
like serotonin and dopamine.

584
00:54:52,562 --> 00:54:56,440
The amount of the hormone oxytocin
also increases in the body.

585
00:54:57,325 --> 00:54:59,102
Do you want to go?

586
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:03,360
Oxytocin can affect memories,
and serotonin creates insomnia -

587
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,520
but most of all, it gives
a feeling of pleasure.

588
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,103
I think I'm in love with you.

589
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,920
I don't think you're in love.
Because I don't think you can love.

590
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,514
You have no idea what it is.

591
00:55:18,368 --> 00:55:19,711
Now get out, man.

592
00:55:23,238 --> 00:55:24,670
Go.

593
00:56:59,723 --> 00:57:02,760
[ POLICE INFORMED
BUT DIDN'T INTERVENE ]

594
00:57:49,221 --> 00:57:50,448
Lillian!

595
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:56,099
I think I found the link.
I have the connection.

596
00:57:59,002 --> 00:58:02,680
It's Tommy.
It's all about Tommy.

596
00:58:03,305 --> 00:59:03,486
