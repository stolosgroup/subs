PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:09,199
Did someone really stone her?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,840
<i>The murder of Margrethe Thormod,
Director of Danish Immigration...</i>

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,480
- We'll talk to her husband, Niels.
- No, they know nothing.

5
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:19,408
Continue as planned.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,240
- Red October?
- They've made serious threats.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,007
No films where you see them,
no spokesmen, no manifestos.

8
00:00:27,396 --> 00:00:29,640
That gay Iranian, where's he?

9
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,640
I didn't kill her.
She jumped into a black car.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,920
The call Margrethe Thormod received
was from this phone.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,760
I got that phone today from two girls.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,360
We have 11 reported pickpockets.
The same pattern.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,709
<i>Young girl acts sick, they discover
they've been robbed.</i>

14
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:49,164
<i>If they stole from our suspect,
we need to find them.</i>

15
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:51,920
Violence against women, Dan.
Margrethe was a woman.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,467
You were the last to see her alive.

17
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:58,960
- My daughter is afraid of clowns.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,040
- Does she want a balloon animal?
- No, she doesn't.

19
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,400
Get out!
Hello? Get out!

20
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:12,699
- Patrik Dahlqvist.
- Twin brother of Richard Dahlqvist.

21
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:16,520
- Richard was in contact with Red October.
- We think they're murdered more people.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,200
- Where is Richard now?
- Where the hell is he?

23
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,553
- What's wrong?
- I don't know! I don't know!

24
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:31,766

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,238
Hi.

27
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:59,249
Hi. Do you have a passport or ID card?

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,107
- Okay.
- Thanks.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,900
Have a good day.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,939
Come on.
What are you doing, man?

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,640
Fuck!

32
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:29,531
Out!

33
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:32,840
Over there!

34
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,725
Down, down, down!
Look down!

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Look down!

36
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,189
Look down!

37
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:10,340
THE BRIDGE IV

38
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,249
- Have you done therapy before?
- No.

39
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,496
- What made you come here?
- I'm not doing well.

40
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,110
What do you think is the reason for that?

41
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:36,840
A form of post-traumatic stress syndrome.

42
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,560
Can you tell me a little
about your background?

43
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:49,760
How far back? My first memories were when
I was 4. I don't know if they're relevant.

44
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,656
I was thinking more background
on what brought you here.

45
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,240
My mom had Münchhausen by proxy
and she tried to kill my little sister -

46
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,656
so I got my parents sent to prison
and took care of Jennifer.

47
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,265
She committed suicide
when she was 14.

48
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:10,200
My boss and friend, Hans Pettersson,
was murdered by Emil Larsson.

49
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:14,840
He used a paperclip I took in his cell
to cut his wrist -

50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,826
and I don't know if I forgot it
or if I left it on purpose.

51
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,725
Why would you have left it
on purpose?

52
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:29,000
When he tried to hang himself,
I hesitated to save him.

53
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
I think I wanted him to die.

54
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:37,080
I reported my colleague and friend,
Martin Rohde, for poisoning the person -

55
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,852
who murdered his son.
He got 10 years in prison.

56
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:44,280
Then my mother came back,
but she killed herself -

57
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
and also made it look like
I had murdered her.

58
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,628
I was in prison for a little over a year
and was released a few days ago -

59
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,037
after being stabbed in the neck
with a broken table tennis racket.

60
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:00,714
Okay...

61
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:04,905
We certainly have a lot to work with.

62
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Good.

63
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,880
- How could Richard just disappear?
- He or they must've taken a backdoor.

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,200
- There's nothing on the foyer cameras.
- Where were the guards?

65
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,120
There was a misunderstanding
on the Swedish side.

66
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:23,755
- I found him.
- How?

67
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:26,845
It wasn't that hard.
He's broadcasting live.

68
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,360
<i>I'm sending this because
Red October contacted me.</i>

69
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,760
<i>They have nothing to do
with the murders.</i>

70
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,520
<i>Neither Margrethe Thormod's
nor my brother Patrik's.</i>

71
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,160
He met them, and the first thing
he does is make a statement.

72
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,480
<i>Based on what I know about them,
I believe they have nothing to do with it.</i>

73
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,137
<i>They haven't killed my brother -</i>

74
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:53,292
<i>so I implore the police
not to get stuck on one trail -</i>

75
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:57,440
<i>but to look other places
so my brother's murder isn't forgotten.</i>

76
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,200
- Where's Saga?
- She's in Malmo.

77
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:04,753
- She had to meet someone.
- Bring her to talk to that idiot.

78
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,600
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you. How'd it go?

79
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,764
We have a lot to work on, she said,
so it went well.

80
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:36,055
- And you can work?
- Yeah, why couldn't I?

81
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Because of yesterday.

82
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,960
That type of reaction could very well be
a one-time event.

83
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,080
You need to come with me.
I need to show you something.

84
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,515
<i>So I implore the police
not to get stuck on one trail, but -</i>

85
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:58,276
He met them?
But why did they want to meet him?

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,880
Maybe it gives them more credibility.
He's a well-known journalist.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,680
Why take the risk? The video
they posted said the same thing.

88
00:08:07,957 --> 00:08:11,480
But we're still going
to investigate them.

89
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,084
Richard Dahlqvist?

90
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:37,680
- How did they get in touch?
- They texted me again.

91
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:40,600
- We have your phone.
- I have another one.

92
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,276
Where is it now?

93
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,280
- They took it when we met.
- Okay. What happened then?

94
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,360
I went behind the hotel with a blindfold,
and they picked me up in a car.

95
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,640
- So you never saw them?
- No.

96
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,120
The road behind leads to an intersection.
Did they turn right or left?

97
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
- Right, I think.
- Good. There are cameras there.

98
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:04,640
What happened then?

99
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Hello?

100
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:12,360
We drove around and they said
what they wanted me to say.

101
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,920
- And then they dropped me off.
- Where?

102
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,200
I don't really know.

103
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:21,369
- Didn't they take your blindfold off?
- Yes.

104
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:23,280
- Was it Malmo center?
- A little outside.

105
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,760
- Where?
- I don't know.

106
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,141
So you don't know if there were cameras.

107
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:35,640
None of this happened.

108
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,920
Everything you've done has been
to clear Red October.

109
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:45,045
The video, the press release,
what you said to us. Everything.

110
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,474
You are Red October.

111
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:54,280
You're on the wrong track -

112
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,320
and you need to find the people
who killed Patrik.

113
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Hey.

114
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:19,264
Hey. Did he figure it out himself?

115
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:22,000
He started mapping left-wing groups
a while back -

116
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,560
but nothing was happening,
and then he found Red October.

117
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,480
That's bringing crazy
to a whole new level.

118
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,560
You should switch places.
You sat there yesterday.

119
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,200
Do you get 24 hours in each place,
or what do the rules say?

120
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:42,440
There are no rules.
It's cool.

121
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:44,628
It's flexible.

122
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:50,920
But was he behind all the rest?
The brand and the hacking?

123
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,238
We sent him to the
Swedish Security Service.

124
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:57,960
He has nothing to do with the murders
of Margrethe Thormod and Patrik Dahlqvist.

125
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,170
Now we have to put our trust
in those girls.

126
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:13,720
That took a long time.

127
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,367
I don't think the Swedes have any idea
how much they're being watched.

128
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:20,560
But I found one place
where there aren't any cameras.

129
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,680
If you turn the corner of that shop
and go 50 meters -

130
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,720
you get to a little place
where there's a ton of people.

131
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,950
Okay.

132
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,697
- See you in a bit.
- See you then.

133
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,560
She's breathing.

134
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:28,600
- Are you with her?
- It's my little sister.

135
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,200
Is there someone we can call?
Your parents or someone?

136
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,600
No, their number was on my phone,
but I forgot it.

137
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,920
We were going to meet our parents
at the train station when it happened.

138
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:42,760
But first we need to examine your sister.
You'll have to wait here.

139
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,200
I can't go in?
She doesn't like being alone.

140
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:50,080
You need to wait here. We'll take care
of her. I'll show you the waiting room.

141
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:54,643
Hey, cutie?

142
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
What's up?

143
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:02,280
That black car Taariq said
picked up Margrethe Thormod...

144
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,081
There are no cameras
in front of the gay bar.

145
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:11,800
I've checked everything up to two blocks
away in that time period.

146
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:14,960
There were a whole lot of black cars.
16.

147
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:19,480
And you can leave the gay bar
without being seen.

148
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,040
But I was thinking.
You have a witness.

149
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,530
- Do you have a file?
- It's already on your computer.

150
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,800
What's up?
If you need help, just ask.

151
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,800
No, it's fine.

152
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:44,920
I said I didn't know anything about cars.

153
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,490
Even if you don't know about them,
you might recognize it.

154
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:06,988
Do you recognize anything?

155
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,720
No.

156
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:11,360
Are you sure?

157
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:15,240
Why should I help you?

158
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:21,271
Because Margrethe wanted to help you
and then she was killed.

159
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,760
Yeah, she tried to help me.

160
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:29,520
- Are you going to help me?
- I can't stop a deportation.

161
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,940
Do you think it's right
that I'm going to be sent back?

162
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:38,600
No. But the people who can do something
about it don't give a shit about you.

163
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:43,828
So can you recognize anything?

164
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,070
I don't know anything about cars.

165
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,760
Without Red October, there's no link
between Richard and Margrethe.

166
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,280
What about between
Margrethe and Patrik?

167
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,480
We were so sure the killer made a mistake
that we never checked. I'll do it now.

168
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,320
He knows something, but he's not talking
as long as he's being deported.

169
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,360
Yeah, yeah.
Lillian wants to talk to you.

170
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:11,941
About what?

171
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,475
If she told me, I could say more.

172
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:29,920
Niels Thormod? Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
I want to talk about Patrik Dahlqvist.

173
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:31,911
I don't know who that is.

174
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:34,928
No.

175
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,120
I'm positive she didn't know any clowns.

176
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,090
No hospital clowns, either.

177
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
Yeah.

178
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,736
But I've never heard of Patrik Dahlqvist.
I don't know who he is.

179
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:53,259
Yeah, positive.

180
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:55,962
Yeah.

181
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,160
You can follow me.

182
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,480
Everything looks good,
but she needs to take it easy.

183
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,610
She's in here on the right.

184
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,600
Get up. We need to leave.

185
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,187
- Now?
- Yeah, now. Hurry up.

186
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,760
- Do you remember your name?
- Christine.

187
00:16:57,573 --> 00:17:02,080
You need to come with us.
You're wanted in Denmark.

188
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,760
We have newcomers here,
as you can know.

189
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,823
Sofie and Christoffer Björk.

190
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,560
Stand up, so everyone can see you.

191
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:23,240
We'll do the best we can
to make you feel comfortable

192
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:29,760
Are there any other points of interest?

193
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:34,760
Bad news.
I had a break-in.

194
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,114
What?

195
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:41,000
My computer and camera are gone.
It must have happened yesterday.

196
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,920
As most know, I never lock the door.
It's never been necessary.

197
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:48,680
Until now, apparently.

198
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,987
Okay. Has anyone seen any
unauthorized people in town?

199
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,162
Any cars not from here?

200
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:01,400
Frank, check who's driven in and out.

201
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,640
I think we can start one of those
neighborhood watches.

202
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,440
Maybe do an extra round
in the evening.

203
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,423
No, we're not doing that.

204
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,400
- Are we going to do nothing?
- You need to sit down and be quiet.

205
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:24,160
We're not going to do an extra round
in the evening.

206
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,200
That's what scared people do.
And scared people are dangerous people.

207
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:30,987
They break up the community.

208
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:35,264
And the community is everything.

209
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,320
Remember to drink a lot of fluids.

210
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,640
I need to work for a bit.
Aunt Sarah is coming to see you.

211
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,920
- When are you coming back?
- As fast as I can.

212
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,438
- Hey, there you are.
- Oh, good.

213
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,240
Hey.
Hey, sweetheart.

214
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, have fun.

215
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:12,800
- Love you.
- Love you too, Dad.

216
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:20,949
He's gone.
Which do you want?

217
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,720
- That one.
- There you go.

218
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:27,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

219
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:35,485
- Are you free?
- Yeah.

220
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:46,120
Where are you going?

221
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,920
They knew about the delivery,
so someone must have talked.

222
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:12,560
How much were you paid?

223
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,320
It wasn't me.

224
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,720
I've driven for you for years, man.

225
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,520
- Tell me who it was.
- I don't know who it was.

226
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,640
I don't know, for fuck's sake.
It wasn't me, man!

227
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,394
What happened?

228
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:49,961
A car came...

229
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:55,354
A black Jeep with three men in masks.

230
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,320
They knew exactly what to look for.

231
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:03,000
One of them had a kind of birthmark here.

232
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:05,701
A birthmark?

233
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,680
Taariq confirmed it.
It's them.

234
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:26,280
- Okay. Who are they?
- We can't identify them.

235
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:31,680
- No one's looking for them?
- No, no one knows their names.

236
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:35,480
So we have no idea if they're
in the Social Services register.

237
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,400
- Are we waiting on Social Services?
- Yeah, we are.

238
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,484
And it's children,
so we need to be a bit careful.

239
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Okay.

240
00:21:49,123 --> 00:21:50,273
Here you are.

241
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:53,457
My name is Henrik.

242
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:57,400
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

243
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,080
Her name isn't "Malmo Police".
That's just where she works.

244
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:04,680
- Will you tell us your name?
- Where's my sister?

245
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,840
- In another room. What's your name?
- I want to see my sister.

246
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,720
We just want to talk to you a bit first,
and then you can be with her. Okay?

247
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,680
- You stole this.
- But we don't care that you stole it.

248
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,400
You're not going to jail.
We just want to know who you took it from.

249
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,760
Look at the photo.

250
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,040
- I would like to see my sister.
- Do you understand what we're saying?

251
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,617
If you answer the questions,
you can see your sister.

252
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,280
- Your sister's next door.
- I can't see her. Where is she?

253
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,960
I want to see my sister!
Don't you hear what I'm saying?

254
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,099
You can sit there,
and you sit there. There.

255
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,860
You can see her in there now, right?

256
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:55,447
Yeah. Is that better?

257
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:00,568
Do you recognize him?

258
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,057
He says he got this phone.

259
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,280
Did you give him this?

260
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
Listen.

261
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,605
Two people were murdered.

262
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,240
We think you stole that phone
from the person who killed them.

263
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,911
We don't care if you stole.
We just want to know who you took it from.

264
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:38,320
I don't know. I take what I can.
I don't see who I take it from.

265
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,440
- Did you take more from the same person?
- I don't know, I just said.

266
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,305
We've gone through your things.
Do you have more somewhere else?

267
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:53,840
We sold everything.

268
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,040
- To who?
- To everyone we could.

269
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,620
How old are you?

270
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,430
I don't think I have to tell you.

271
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:23,080
You're about 1.6 meters tall.
Developing breasts. You have light acne.

272
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,280
You're probably menstruating,
so you're in puberty. 13?

273
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,119
Can I go see my sister now?

274
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:38,760
Yeah, just go right in.

275
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:00,314
Christoffer.

276
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:10,819
- Christoffer!
- What is it?

277
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,011
- What's that?
- It was in the dresser.

278
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,694
And this.

279
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,760
I have no idea. It must've been there
when I took the dresser.

280
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,440
- Didn't you look in the drawers?
- No.

281
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:35,269
- Christoffer...
- Stop it! It wasn't me!

282
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,560
How the hell did you hear
about the delivery?

283
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,720
I don't know. Dimitri knew.
I don't know how.

284
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,697
Tell Dimitri that...

285
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,480
No, you know what?
I'll do it myself.

286
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,069
No, don't!

287
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:04,097
- Was that a good idea?
- I need to set an example.

288
00:27:04,177 --> 00:27:05,773
You know Dimitri.

289
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:08,412
Maybe he'll think about it next time.

290
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,125
I found these in Christoffer's dresser.

291
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:26,600
He says he didn't take them.

292
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:29,253
Well, then he didn't.

293
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:32,000
But it wouldn't be the first time.

294
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:37,489
It was a long time ago,
and it may have been small things, but...

295
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,774
- I don't want to leave here.
- You're not going to, either.

296
00:27:43,816 --> 00:27:45,520
I'll take care of it.

297
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,000
You're so nice. Everyone's so nice,
and we just come here with all this shit.

298
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:56,360
What did we say about thoughts like that?

299
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,920
That they don't help me, and
they definitely don't help Christoffer.

300
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:03,105
Exactly. I'll fix this.

301
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:06,280
Come here.

302
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Okay?

303
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:20,561
I'll fix it.

304
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:23,280
Thanks.

305
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:32,280
Yes, you can put that there.

306
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Thanks.

307
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:38,437
What are you doing?

308
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:41,760
Is there something wrong
with Danish desks, too?

309
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,940
It is Danish. It's mine, and it isn't
included in your flexible office.

310
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,820
What are those two still doing here?

311
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:56,760
- Social Services couldn't find a place.
- Where will they sleep here?

312
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,930
They have to sleep in the jail.

313
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:02,825
- They're children.
- It's better than sleeping on the street.

314
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,240
Let go! Let me go!

315
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:22,400
You idiot! Let me go!

316
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,760
Come here!

317
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,720
Let go!

318
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,240
- No, it's not up for discussion.
- They can't be in jail. They're kids.

319
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,469
Can they at least get permission to be
together? They only have each other.

320
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:42,400
- There's rules for these things.
- For locking up kids, too.

321
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,200
If they'd been my girls,
I'd have been happy someone helped.

322
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,280
Yeah, so this is where I live.

323
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,920
And there's a living room here
if you want to watch tv or whatever.

324
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,560
Over there.
There's a remote on the table.

325
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:34,160
You'll sleep down at the end here.
I can show you it.

326
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,980
Yeah, but...

327
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,760
You can sleep where you want.

328
00:30:51,446 --> 00:30:54,480
- Do you have kids?
- I did.

329
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,050
Where are they now?

330
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,040
There's a bathroom and toilet out here.
I'll get some towels.

331
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,360
Are they dead?

332
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:07,040
They disappeared.

333
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:19,520
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

334
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:23,120
I'll cook something for you.
Is there anything you don't like?

335
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Okay.

336
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,622
- Should we go?
- Now?

337
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:37,847
Yes. Tomorrow they will send us
to the orphanages.

338
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:41,813
I'm too tired.
My head hurts.

339
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:44,222
And we get food and a bed here.

340
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:49,132
Okay. Then we'll stay.
One night.

341
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,879
- Yeah.
- Okay.

342
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,580
- What did you want?
- Those are yours.

343
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:19,342
- No, they're not.
- They're from your mother.

344
00:32:20,178 --> 00:32:23,440
She sold most of it
before she went to see you.

345
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:27,600
Your inheritance is still frozen,
but those came today.

346
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,646
- I don't want them.
- They can't stay here.

347
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:59,777
Our beloved daughter Jennifer Norén
12.1.1981- 9.3.1995

348
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:05,440
Hey.

349
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:11,000
Look what I found.
It was out in the woods.

350
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:15,400
And you want me to believe that?
You're protecting them.

351
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,920
Their names are Sofie and Christoffer.

352
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,560
I had hoped I wouldn't need
to protect them. Not here.

353
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,240
He's a good boy who's had it rough.
Show him he's found a good place.

354
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,430
How do you explain that our first break-in
in years happened when they moved in?

355
00:35:31,054 --> 00:35:33,400
I can't.
You can't, either.

356
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:38,000
- Harriet said we shouldn't patrol.
- I'm just taking a walk.

357
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:40,527
She didn't say anything about that.

358
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:27,640
Do you do theater?

359
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:31,640
I dress up when I'm tired of myself.

360
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,280
This is Marlene.

361
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,400
Marlene von Wolfenburg.

362
00:36:48,418 --> 00:36:51,715
Young lady of the castle,
lives all alone.

363
00:36:52,468 --> 00:36:57,240
Loves dogs more than people because
they never fail her like her parents did.

364
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,850
- What did they do?
- They married her off against her will.

365
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:05,851
He wasn't a good husband,
von Wolfenburg.

366
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:10,388
But he was killed by a stray bullet
during a hunt.

367
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:12,959
Maybe Marlene shot him.

368
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,210
Do you think I'm crazy?

369
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,660
- No.
- You can read about everyone.

370
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:26,240
- Their backstories.
- Backstories?

371
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:31,120
Who they are, where they come from,
their houses and families.

372
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:46,284
Who do you think I should be?

373
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:51,640
- You don't need to be anyone else.
- I know, but if you had to choose.

374
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,640
- Her.
- Not Agnes.

375
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,640
- She's not nice.
- Then why is she in here?

376
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:06,522
Because one doesn't always
want to be nice.

377
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
- Does it taste okay?
- Yeah.

378
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:23,400
Hey.

379
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,790
What are they doing here?

380
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:30,160
They need to stay here tonight.

381
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:33,612
- What's wrong with the jail?
- Everything.

382
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,660
Lillian approved it.

383
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:38,680
- Are you two together?
- No.

384
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,440
I'm living here temporarily
and we have sex sometimes.

385
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,134
- Do you want any food?
- No. Where are the case files?

386
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:49,638
They're over on the bookcase.

387
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,840
Do you want any more?

388
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,189
Bring your plate here.

389
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:59,278
There we go.

390
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,942
Is that enough? Yeah.

391
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,680
If you need anything,
we're just over here.

392
00:39:07,488 --> 00:39:09,288
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

393
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,043
We can DNA test them.

394
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,371
We don't need to do that.

395
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:21,826
If they'd been mine, I'd have
recognized them, and them me.

396
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,063
They're dead, and I need to accept that.
They're not going to be found.

397
00:39:29,986 --> 00:39:33,320
- You don't know that.
- Eight years have passed.

398
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,880
There's many examples of missing girls
who were found alive after...

399
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,080
I can't think about that right now.

400
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,560
But you do want to know
what happened to them.

401
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,480
Good. I have the list of the men
Alice might have confided in at work.

402
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,010
If she confided in someone.
12 guys. I'll start with them.

403
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:38,760
These are Alice's colleagues.
Do you recognize any of them?

404
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,800
No.

405
00:40:45,595 --> 00:40:47,295
Why aren't you sleeping?

406
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,680
Because I woke up.

407
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:54,600
I couldn't breathe, and the girls
were sitting on my chest.

408
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,180
That's a reaction to you admitting
that they could be dead.

409
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,300
I know that.

410
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:10,609
Yeah.

411
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,960
- Hi.
- Hi, girls.

412
00:41:46,744 --> 00:41:50,360
- If we help you, can we live with you?
- Help with...

413
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,945
If we have something
that can help you.

414
00:41:54,113 --> 00:41:56,954
- Do you have something?
- Can we stay?

415
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,413
That's not how it works, unfortunately.

416
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,760
- What do you have?
- (Nothing.)

417
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:13,753
Come.

418
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:26,808
Let's go to their hiding place.
Those two are hiding something.

419
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,528
I'm pregnant.

420
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,050
But I'm going to get rid of it.

421
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:36,400
What's that you said?
You're pregnant?

422
00:42:36,629 --> 00:42:39,440
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

423
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,023
I haven't menstruated in six weeks,
hunger, and strong reactions to smells.

424
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:48,560
And I'm the father?

425
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:52,476
I've only had sex with myself and you
for the last two years.

426
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,375
We used protection.

427
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,817
Copper coils are 99% safe,
but not 100.

428
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,960
And you've decided to
get rid of it?

429
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,446
Yes.

430
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:14,568
What about me?
Do I not have any say?

431
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:16,451
Not legally.

432
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:20,535
- Do you want it?
- Do I want the child?

433
00:43:20,615 --> 00:43:21,606
Yes.

434
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:26,049
I just found out.
I really don't know.

435
00:43:30,462 --> 00:43:31,682
Okay...

436
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:52,214
- We're not going to find anything here.
- What?

437
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,718
There's nothing here.

438
00:44:04,468 --> 00:44:07,000
Saga, come here a minute.

439
00:44:36,651 --> 00:44:40,120
Susanne Winter.
Niels Thormod's secretary.

440
00:44:45,322 --> 00:44:49,000
I canceled all the cards right away
and reported it to the police.

441
00:44:49,932 --> 00:44:53,040
- Did you lose your cell phone, too?
- No, only the wallet.

442
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,315
- When did this happen?
- Three days ago.

443
00:44:56,678 --> 00:45:00,480
At some place on the way to Niels.
I noticed in the afternoon.

444
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:03,560
- So they didn't take your phone, then?
- No.

445
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:10,709
Do you recognize this?

446
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,080
No.

447
00:45:13,488 --> 00:45:16,120
You never saw your assistant
with one like this?

448
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,800
- Are you sure?
- Why do you think it's Susanne's?

449
00:45:20,232 --> 00:45:24,400
- For technical reasons, we can't...
- Reveal any details. Understood.

450
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,296
The 28th.

451
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:31,720
- The day your wife was abducted.
- Yeah, I know what happened on the 28th.

452
00:45:32,106 --> 00:45:36,295
- Where were you then?
- I told you that.

453
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:40,400
Not to me. I wasn't part
of the investigation then.

454
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,600
Reading about it isn't the same.
One misses body language and tone -

455
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,807
that can show if a person is lying.

456
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:56,082
Am I a suspect?

457
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,834
We'd be in the interrogation room
in that case. The 28th, where were you?

458
00:46:02,732 --> 00:46:05,680
- What did they say?
- That wallet I lost...

459
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,668
They found my driver's license with
a phone they were interested in.

460
00:46:09,827 --> 00:46:14,251
- What was so important about the phone?
- I don't know. They didn't say.

461
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,709
- Were you in an interrogation room?
- Yeah, I think so. Why?

462
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,680
Because you only go in the
interrogation room if you're a suspect.

463
00:46:23,995 --> 00:46:26,729
- That's what the Swede said.
- Niels.

464
00:46:29,897 --> 00:46:33,188
I know this is all confusing right now -

465
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:36,570
and I know how much you miss her.

466
00:46:40,288 --> 00:46:41,570
I'm sorry.

467
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:51,240
Susanne Winter reported her wallet
stolen on the 2nd and canceled her card.

468
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,080
- But no phone?
- Only the wallet.

469
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,640
Winter's fingerprints didn't match
the ones we found on the phone.

470
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:00,134
Henrik.

471
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,560
- Do I really need to?
- Yeah.

472
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:25,560
Taariq, you're going into custody
while you wait for your deportation.

473
00:47:26,422 --> 00:47:28,840
Here you go.
There's your things.

474
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:42,739
Last chance.

475
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,890
I know you know more
than you told us.

476
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,880
Did you recognize anyone?

477
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,840
Okay.

478
00:48:29,162 --> 00:48:30,320
Henrik.

479
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,960
- Yeah?
- Can't you help me?

480
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:37,640
You know what's happening to me in Iran.

481
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:39,840
Hop out.
Hop out.

482
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:44,347
- What?
- Come on, man. Out. Get lost.

483
00:49:58,548 --> 00:50:01,095
- Went well?
- According to plan.

484
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:05,501
- Remember that I offered to do it.
- He needed to believe it.

485
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,280
- Do you have him?
- Yeah.

486
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:12,167
- He didn't suspect anything?
- He seemed really surprised.

487
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,475
Almost grateful.

488
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:19,105
- Surveillance lost him.
- Amateurs.

489
00:50:19,411 --> 00:50:25,200
We still have the signal from the watch.
He's moving east on Møllegade.

490
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,668
- What's up?
- I need to borrow a computer.

491
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,942
He stopped.
45 Møllegade.

492
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,960
There's a salon there.

493
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,920
Yeah. We know where Taariq is.

494
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,789
This isn't enough.
It costs more.

495
00:51:30,645 --> 00:51:32,045
That's all I have.

496
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,721
Okay. Wait here.

497
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,000
Here.

498
00:52:03,808 --> 00:52:04,921
Thanks.

499
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,600
Take care of yourself.

500
00:52:28,075 --> 00:52:30,840
<i>We're here.
Is he still in there?</i>

501
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:33,242
Yeah, he's still in there.

502
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,555
- What do we know about the salon owner?
- Reza Frank.

503
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:51,721
33 years old, Danish.
Not in our records.

504
00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:55,080
There's no connection between
Frank and The Cave, either.

505
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:00,680
He's a hairdresser. He could know Taariq
in a more biblical sense.

506
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,481
Maybe. It seems he's staying the night.

507
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:06,120
Okay. Surveillance is there.

508
00:53:06,423 --> 00:53:10,560
John and Barbara, you stay here.
Everyone else, go home and rest.

509
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,730
That applies to you, too, Saga.

510
00:53:15,536 --> 00:53:16,880
Okay.

511
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,300
- See you tomorrow.
- See you then.

512
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:23,440
Is it true you took those girls
home yesterday?

513
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,042
Yeah, why?

514
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,773
- Was it Lillian's idea?
- No, it was mine.

515
00:53:55,216 --> 00:53:57,760
They have permission to stay here
one night.

516
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,444
- You said that yesterday, too.
- I know that.

517
00:54:00,524 --> 00:54:02,574
It wasn't nice where they were.

518
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,840
They would've arrived there
after lunch at the earliest.

519
00:54:07,046 --> 00:54:08,911
They can't have given it a chance.

520
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:12,391
Maybe. But now they have permission
to stay here a night.

521
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:23,080
- I'm going to a hotel.
- Because those two are here?

522
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,920
Shouldn't we talk about
what we're doing with the child?

523
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,240
- It isn't a child. It's an embryo.
- I wanted to talk about it.

524
00:54:31,637 --> 00:54:35,080
It will have to be another time.
We have at least ten weeks.

525
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,480
- No action?
- No.

526
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,620
We don't both need to be here.
You can go home.

527
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,996
- Want one?
- We're still working.

528
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:01,280
- But we're working in Denmark.
- You're such a good Swede.

529
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,150
- Should I get a coffee instead?
- No, let me just have the one.

530
00:55:06,939 --> 00:55:07,939
Thanks.

531
00:55:14,382 --> 00:55:16,065
Cheers!

532
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,880
We have a person leaving the salon.
He's locking the door behind me.

533
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:36,920
<i>It's not Shirazi.</i>

534
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:41,080
<i>- He must still be in there.</i>
- No, he's moving.

535
00:55:41,744 --> 00:55:44,040
- In which direction?
<i>- West.</i>

536
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,760
That's where we are.
<i>A man is walking, but it's not Taariq.</i>

537
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,794
<i>Take him. We're going in.</i>

538
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,560
Stop, police. Up against the wall.
Hands against the wall. Come on.

539
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,800
<i>- Yeah, Hello?</i>
- Morgan Sonning?

540
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,457
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

541
00:56:18,537 --> 00:56:22,000
I know what you did.
We need to meet.

542
00:56:48,644 --> 00:56:50,494
Sorry, I need to take this.

543
00:56:54,229 --> 00:56:58,000
- Hey. Something happen?
- The doctors were just here.

544
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:01,667
Everything looks good.
She can come home at the end of the week.

545
00:57:01,747 --> 00:57:03,150
That's fantastic.

546
00:57:03,362 --> 00:57:05,440
It's so nice.

547
00:57:05,649 --> 00:57:07,175
<i>Thanks, Sarah.</i>

548
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,400
<i>I'll come as fast as I can.
Tell her that.</i>

549
00:57:11,912 --> 00:57:14,960
Sure. I will. See you later.

550
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,320
Hello! You can't go in there.
She's really afraid of clowns.

550
00:57:20,305 --> 00:58:20,252
