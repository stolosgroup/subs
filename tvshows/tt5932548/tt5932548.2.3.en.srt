1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,800
May the Gods speak!

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,840
The true battle...

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,760
..does not always unfold
upon the field.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,840
Sometimes,
it is the one man you need to fear.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,640
The one who can scare the dead...

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,760
Tear down temples...

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,760
Shift the pillars of time.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,520
That's where the true danger lies.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,480
The Betwixt must fast for two moons
between each journey,

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,520
only then will she receive
the great vision.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,840
Have you received any great visions?
Any visions at all?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,720
No? But, hey, no pressure.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, my sister,
I wish I had half your strength,

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,680
but I won't let you down, I promise.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,280
For I truly know now
that there is a light in this world.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,040
There is a light.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,840
My name is Harka.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,720
And how exactly do you fit
into all this?

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I am all of this.

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>In the beginning,</i>
<i>there were the brothers.</i>

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,320
<i>The first and the second man.</i>

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,720
Veran! Veran, where are you?

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,440
<i>The Gods allowed the brothers</i>
<i>to play in their garden.</i>

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,400
Veran.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,840
<i>-The eldest, Harka...</i>
-Where have you gone?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,320
<i>was destined to lead</i>
<i>all children of the Gods.</i>

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,640
One, two, three, four...

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,920
..five, six.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,200
<i>The first, Harka, had to learn</i>
<i>of the Wonder.</i>

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,600
<i>The Gods left fruits</i>
<i>to see their garden as it truly is.</i>

31

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,200
Sometimes I feel
I'm not strong enough.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,240
Strong enough for the Wonder.

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,600
<i>The Gods saw and heard everything.</i>

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,080
<i>When I look out my window</i>

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,240
<i>Many sights to see</i>

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,720
<i>And when I look in my window</i>

38
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,520
<i>So many different people to be</i>

39
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,160
<i>Oh, no</i>

40
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,800
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

41
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,400
<i>Must be the season of the witch, yeah</i>

42
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,160
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,400
<i>You got to pick up every stitch</i>

44
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,880
<i>The rabbits running in the ditch</i>

45
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,200
<i>Beatnicks are out to make it rich</i>

46
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,200
We must pay our respects to Veran.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
That fiend is many things.

48
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,840
He is not the Veran.

49
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,640
I pray to the Aura for the coming day.
I thank you for all it may bring.

50
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,480
Hear me, Mars.
Make me strong this day.

51
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,000
I pray to you Pino
that you protect my feet,

52
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,160
that all day long, my boot stays on.

53
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,160
That the leather doesn't fray
or the buckle snap.

54
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,760
..shield of war. Blessed are thou
for thy conquering purposes.

55
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,200
..sacred feast.
Accept this wine I place before you.

56
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,800
Do not slight me for my slight.

57
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,520
-General Aulus, come quickly.
-I'm busy.

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,840
General, a queen is at the gates.

59
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
Which one is she? The stumpy one?
The one with the log

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,280
-or the bald one having a fit?
-The bald one.

61
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,080
-She's a queen?
-Aye, sir.

62
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
-What's your name?
-Felix.

63
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,960
Well, Felix, let's say we go
and nip this in the bud, eh?

64
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,480
Good morning, most noble queen.
On behalf of the emperor...

65
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,800
Hark the howling of our dead!

66
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,000
They bring a warning.

67
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,440
Leave this place, Demon,
or face our wrath.

68
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,080
On behalf of the emperor,
I welcome you...

69
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,200
-I shit on your emperor!
-Now you're just being rude.

70
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,520
I appreciate the visit,
I have lots to do

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,920
and you've clearly had a big night...

72
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,520
You make sacrifices of our people.

73
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,400
In these woods.

74
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,480
You leave unburied souls
to rot in this world.

75
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,960
You must pay.

76
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,160
You desecrate our dead.
Leave now, demon,

77
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,280
or you will pay.

78
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,920
Well, I can see you're upset.

79
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,400
Let me introduce you to Felix.

80
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,920
It was his idea to invade your country.
We just came along to help.

81
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
I'll leave it to him to explain.

82
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,240
-Felix?
-What?

83
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,880
Guards!

84
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,920
We'll be back, and we'll bring
our brothers and sisters

85
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,480
to burn this place down!

86
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,280
Oh, I look forward to that.

87
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
She was right.

88
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,160
-Who was?
-The crazy old queen.

89
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,720
There are bodies in the forest.

90
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,960
Many children, girls,
slain and left to rot.

91
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,080
What makes you think
that's anything to do with us?

92
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,200
Because I watched it happen.

93
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,120
You don't have to answer.
I'm not shocked.

94
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,480
I'm sure there's a good explanation.
I just don't know it.

95
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,960
<i>We lie awake and shake like leaves</i>

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,480
<i>Upon the green and haunted trees</i>

97
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,720
<i>And listen to our knocking knees</i>

98
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,920
<i>The smell of bodies on the breeze</i>

99
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,480
<i>The smell of bodies on the breeze</i>

100
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,520
Do you know what a messiah is?

101
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,040
Why don't you tell me?

102
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
I've met quite a few.

103
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,000
Persia, Canaan, Athens.

104
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
They all have one thing in common.

105
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,760
They're all so certain.

106
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Certain of their truth.

107
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Of the sanctity of their mission.

108
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Some are just madmen or women.

109
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,400
But some are dangerous.

110
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Very dangerous.

111
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,520
So you need to find that girl.

112
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,280
Before he does.

113
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,840
You mean Veran?

114
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,400
Veran is finished.

115
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,680
He's living on borrowed time.

116
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Well, if it's not Veran, then who?

117
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Hello, it's all right.

118
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,840
You're hunting?

119
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
-What you after?
-Rabbits.

120
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,280
-Your family?
-They're dead.

121
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,400
The Romans came.
They burned our village.

122
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,600
That's a good spear.

123
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
-This is a good spot.
-Why are you here?

124
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,760
I have to go now.

125
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,480
Good luck.

126
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,240
You worked hard to know our ways.

127
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,760
There's so much left to learn.

128
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,480
You were a warrior once,
fought many battles.

129
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,120
Your queen prized you.

130
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,760
It was a long time ago.

131
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,360
You'll be a warrior again.

132
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,240
But to serve the Gods,
you must first give up your child.

133
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,720
He'll be safe with one
of the other tribes.

134
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,480
Can... can he not stay in our tribe?

135
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,040
Your path must be clear.

136
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
You will not see your son again.

137
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,040
Is your path clear?

138
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,680
-I'm not hungry.
-Oh. They took such a long time to grow.

139
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,760
I grew them for you specially.

140
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,800
There.

141
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,080
Last night you dreamed of her.

142
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,360
-Who?
-Your sister.

143
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,520
-How'd you know that?
-Because you cried out in your sleep.

144
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,480
-Why do you think she came for you?
-It was a coincidence.

145
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,400
-Coincidence.
-Maybe she came back to punish me.

146
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,280
And I wouldn't blame her.

147
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Tell me your dream.

148
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,080
I dreamt the last time I saw her.
The last time we spoke.

149
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,560
My father had been sacrificed.

150
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,720
I marked the occasion by accusing her
of betraying our father, betraying me,

151
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,840
of taking my place.

152
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,480
I said terrible things.
Things I can never take back.

153
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,880
-Well, you were you blind with grief.
-I abandoned her and now she's dead.

154
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Who the fuck am I?

155
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,240
And who the fuck are you?

156
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,000
And what the fuck do you want
with a lost, confused, stupid...

157
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,680
Look at me! I don't know
if I want a shit or a haircut.

158
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,640
Was your love for your sister
half-hearted?

159
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
And what on earth good
did that ever do?

160
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,680
I know what it's like to mourn blood.

161
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,400
Many years ago I had a brother.

162
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,320
<i>Where have you been?</i>

163
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,600
<i>You've been gone since the spring.</i>

164
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I loved him more than I loved
the rivers.

165
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,800
<i>-What's that?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>

166
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,280
More than the stars,

167
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,600
and I trusted him
more than I trusted myself.

168
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,480
<i>Have you seen the apples?</i>
<i>The apples are back.</i>

169
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,320
<i>I'm hungry. Bring me an apple.</i>

170
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,480
<i>A good one, mind. The best.</i>

171
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,920
And he used that trust to destroy me.

172
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,680
To take my place.

173
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,560
<i>Hello, friend. Here.</i>

174
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,960
<i>Harka! No, Harka!</i>

175
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,720
<i>-You tricked me. Why?</i>
<i>-Harka!</i>

176
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,320
Just as I was destroyed so were you.
By the same force.

177
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,360
That's why you are here.

178
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,360
He who wronged you, wronged me.

179
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,640
They are the same.

180
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,760
-What's his name?
-His name is Phelan.

181
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,160
Your sacrifice proves your faith.

182
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
The time has come

183
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,760
-Are you ready to fight?
-I am.

184
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,360
Listen very carefully.

185
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,960
This day, I will be betrayed.

186
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,960
The Druids will split asunder.

187
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,120
When it happens, which way will you go?

188
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,080
With you, Veran. Always.

189
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Here's what I want you to do.

190
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,960
Do you know what the runes say?

191
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,680
Nobody knows except Veran.

192
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,800
I know.

193
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,520
Well, don't you want to know?

194
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,200
You a bit curious?
Nervous, but curious? Come on.

195
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,920
-Yes.
-Well, then, let's see.

196
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,320
Oh, yes.

197
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,120
This was Veran. Pure Veran.

198
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,960
This is so good, it's almost funny.

199
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,040
What does it say?

200
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,560
It says, "I'm not a queen,
but a sacrifice."

201
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,320
-Veran wrote that?
-Upon your sister.

202
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,680
Your blood. Veran.

203
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,920
My brother.

204
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,960
Brearn, I beseech you.

205
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,680
We must pay our respects.
-No.

206
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,440
Think, Brearn.
Grief has poisoned your soul.

207
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,920
The age is poisoned.

208
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,680
-And there... there is the poisoner.
-Brearn, no.

209
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,480
This fiend.

210
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,720
This devil, this...
This is Rome's whore.

211
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,320
-You challenge me?
-And see more sorcery?

212
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,520
No.

213
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,280
Sisters. Brothers.

214
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,240
The road ahead splits two ways.

215
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,040
Walk with Veran
and you walk blind into the abyss.

216
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,880
This day, I lead another path.
The path to the first man.

217
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,440
Harka is risen! We will go to him.

218
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,440
We will find the Dead Man.

219
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,960
-Dead Man! Dead Man!
-Dead Man.

220
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,040
The Dead Man has risen!
I serve the Dead Man!

221
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,280
<i>A pretty rosebush in our yard</i>

222
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,480
<i>And behind that bush</i>
<i>Stands a lad right hard</i>

223
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,760
<i>And a lass by his side...</i>

224
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,880
Nice ditty.

225
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,840
Somewhat base subject,
but the men enjoy that.

226
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,320
They like their tunes to reek
of sex and death.

227
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,480
Notice anything strange?

228
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,280
No Gods. No effigies of those
who watch over us.

229
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,040
How does he given supplication,
I wonder?

230
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,600
You must have seen him pray.
Who does he favor?

231
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,480
-Mars? Jupiter?
-I don't even know the difference.

232
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,800
-Aren't we both Roman now?
-I'll eat your food...

233
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,320
-I'll drink your wine...
-Count our silver?

234
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,560
-Happily.
-But, erm, and no offense here.

235
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,800
Your poxy Gods can go
and fuck themselves.

236
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,160
-I like you.
-No, you don't.

237
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,360
We Romans, true Romans,

238
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,320
we like everything ordered.
We like to know what's what.

239
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,880
Straight roads, straight thinking.

240
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,360
This island is full of dark diversions.

241
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,840
I'm here to make sure no one gets lost.

242
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,600
You see, I represent the true Rome.

243
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,040
The Pantheon, Emperor, Senate.

244
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,400
The one you and the general
swore allegiance to, Queen Amena.

245
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,800
That is who you serve now, is it not?

246
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,280
Mate, your face rings a bell.

247
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,480
My shoes rings a bell.

248
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,280
-You were in Egypt?
-It's true.

249
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,880
I follow the empire like
a blue bottle follows a cow's arse.

250
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
I was with the ninth in Pannonia

251
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,160
when half of you were mere glints
in your neighbor's eyes.

252
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,720
There was in the legion at that time
young praefectus.

253
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,560
What was his name?

254
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,200
Lucius something...

255
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,480
Lucius Validus.

256
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,080
That's the one.

257
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,280
Many in Rome look at the general,
and they see the future.

258
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
Is that what you see?

259
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,440
What do you see when you look at me?

260
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,800
I shall let the general know
you dropped by.

261
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,080
I'm sure he'll be as intrigued
by your line of questioning.

262
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,080
The emperor was...
very impressed with you.

263
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,960
I'd like him to be able to maintain
that good impression.

264
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,080
So...

265
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,400
..if there's any information.

266
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,760
Anything concerning the general's plans.

267
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,720
Anything perhaps to do with...

268
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,720
...what happened out in the woods.

269
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,360
I'm sure the emperor can rely on you
to pass it on.

270
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,080
He was the general's most trusted ally.

271
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,640
Then one day,
he just disappeared into thin air.

272
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,240
-And no one knows where he went?
-No one.

273
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Strange.

274
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,600
Well, I must be strolling.

275
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,680
It remains for me to pass the hut.

276
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,440
<i>There was a maid, so I've been told</i>

277
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,720
<i>She had no name, she had no home</i>

278
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,240
<i>Yet by herself and all alone</i>

279
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,520
<i>She brought down all the Gods of Rome</i>

280
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,000
<i>She brought down all the Gods of Rome</i>

281
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Who goes there?

282
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,640
Who goes?

283
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Show yourself!

284
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,960
You took your time.

285
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,480
Voices... There's voices
coming from the earth. Listen.

286
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,440
Listen! I swear.

287
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,800
This is haunted ground.
We shouldn't be here.

288
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
All I hear is you gibbering.

289
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,040
-We should tell the praefectus.
-Tell him what?

290
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,440
Sir, we're under siege
from the unquiet souls of the dead.

291
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,800
I'm going to die here. I can feel it.

292
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,000
Hey, pull yourself together, mate.

293
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,320
Oh, mercy.

294
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,080
Oh, bollocks.

295
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,080
How many are there?

296
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,160
The only one we got so far, sir.

297
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,520
The rest just... just vanished.

298
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,400
Like ghosts.

299
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,680
Ghosts don't need sewers
to get in and out of, do they?

300
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,040
Your father Pellenor, did you love him?

301
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,200
Sorry, forgive me.
I'm obsessed with love.

302
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,080
I think about love all the time.

303
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,640
I had love once. Perfect love.

304
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,040
I believe if you really want
to destroy something,

305
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,160
you don't use a sword or an arrow,

306
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,400
you use love, no?

307
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
It's a much stronger subject.

308
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,080
Your father, did he expect you
to follow him?

309
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
To become king yourself?

310
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,280
Veran disagreed.

311
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,000
Would you be free of Veran's web,
Son of Pellenor?

312
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,840
Why can't the Holy Dell
be near the reed beds?

313
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,120
The Holy Dell is only holy
because it has remained a secret.

314
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,640
Many Druids have studied here.
It's protected by the Gods.

315
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
We could always fly.

316
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,360
Sir, he says he know where they are.

317
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,120
To be clear, it wasn't my idea
to give you the call.

318
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,880
-If it was up to me... This way.
-Where is he?

319
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
It's probably bollocks.

320
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,440
No one knows where the camp is
but my brother.

321
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,120
He works the reed beds
down the river mouth.

322
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,920
He says every full moon, the girlie and
warlock go there and they dance about.

323
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,760
-They never miss a month.
-Where are these reeds beds?

324
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,920
This is a good spot.

325
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,240
Give me the sickle.

326
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,160
The moon isn't full.

327
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
-Yes, it is.
-Oh, you know better?

328
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,920
-Should I just go? You've got this?
-It's full.

329
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,040
Wait.

330
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,240
-Fucking freezing.
-Wait.

331
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,520
Waiting.

332
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,640
-And now, it's full, so...
-Yeah.

333
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,240
Pass the...

334
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,000
Can you?

335
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,680
Thank you.

336
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,400
Begin.

337
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,000
What's the next part?

338
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,880
-What?
-For the prophecy?

339
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,240
You said when I pass through air,
you'd tell me the next bit.

340
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,280
It can wait till morning.

341
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,400
What about our legions of the dead?

342
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,080
"The maiden will waiver on the path
and fall into the arms of the eagle."

343
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,760
Eagles don't have arms.

344
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,240
You got a problem,
take it up with the Gods.

345
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,600
-Tell me. I'm listening.
-Then fuckin' listen.

346
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,880
"The maiden will waiver on the path
and fall into the arms of the eagle.

347
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,520
Only the eagle can show her
the true path to the Lake of Tears.

348
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,240
At the Lake of Tears,
she will be reborn."

349
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,760
"Reborn?"

350
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,320
-Or forborne.
-What?

351
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
-What?
-What?

352
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,200
I just told you, "At the Lake of Tears,
she will be reborn...

353
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,880
-..or forborne."
-Well, which is it?

354
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,320
How come you don't know?
Were you actually listening?

355
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,120
Oh, I listened.
But you didn't want to clear that up?

356
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,160
Don't know which it is?

357
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,120
My guts were hanging out on the floor,
I'd lost about six flagons of blood,

358
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,760
and Veran speaks
in that funny, croaky voice.

359
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,560
What does "forborne" mean?

360
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,760
Basically, the same as we're born.

361
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,640
What does "forborne" mean?
What does it exactly mean?

362
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Sacrificed.

363
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,840
-Excuse me?
-Yeah. You heard me.

364
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
"Sacrificed."

365
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,480
Look, these prophecies,

366
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,000
the language they use,
they're ambiguous.

367
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,040
-"Sacrificed."
-The wording can't be taken literally.

368
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,720
For instance, eagles don't have arms.

369
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
-What is it...
-Shh.

370
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,600
We are surrounded.

371
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,480
What do we do? I can't run.

372
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,600
Fell out of the fucking sky...

373
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,320
Here.

374
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,160
Remember Toba, the wounded fox?

375
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,600
"Toba almighty, help me escape
the jaws which would devour me."

376
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
I'll draw them away.

377
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,040
Ready? Together.

378
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,040
The girl! Get the girl! Get the...

379
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,720
Where is she?

380
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,920
Here! Over here!

381
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,600
Oh, shit.

382
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,200
Spread out! They can't escape.

383
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,760
Easy child. I won't hurt you.

384
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,160
That's it. Stay still.

385
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,160
North of here lies a village...

386
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,200
..at the mouth of the river
beneath the rock of the crow.

387
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,440
The fisherman who lives there
has three sons. All fair.

388
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,720
Bring them to me.

389
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,280
Come along.

390
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,840
-How did they find us?
-They probably followed your smell.

391
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Everything was inside there.

392
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,880
My herbs, potions, poultices,
extracts, grasses, bones, relics.

393
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Big Pebble was in there.

394
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,960
You always carry Big Pebble.

395
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,840
You never let Big Pebble
out of your sight.

396
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,240
All right, everything except Big Pebble.

397
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,480
It's too dangerous here now.
We must move far away.

398
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,840
-The work of 20 moons!
-We can start again.

399
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,520
It's just herbs and grasses.

400
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,280
We can gather them again
and make new offerings.

401
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,400
All is not lost.

402
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,520
What are you doing? I can't.

403
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,400
Eat it. You may as well.
You're right. All is not lost.

404
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,080
You know tricks.
You'll make a good illusionist.

405
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,000
Go from town to town, make the children
gasp with your amazing powers.

406
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,200
But there won't be a town or children,

407
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,200
because the world will have ended
because of you.

408
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,240
So, come on. Fill your stupid belly.

409
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,160
-I await the great vision.
-Eat.

410
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,440
-I await the great vision!
-I don't believe you!

411
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,120
What do I do, Big Pebble?
Tell me, please.

412
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,640
Because until she's prepared
to surrender to this,

413
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,120
to really surrender with all her soul...

414
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
..we're wasting our time.

415
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,840
Twenty moons of the smock.

416
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,520
She's good, but is she good enough
to defeat the Romans?

417
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,760
Now, we've lost too much time.

418
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Too much.

419
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
We've lost...

420
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
We've lost.

420
00:38:52,305 --> 00:39:52,457
