1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,240
A toast to your divine victory.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,400
My divine victory.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,680
You see, it isn't your victory.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,320
It isn't your victory
because it isn't your war.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,760
You have no idea what game you're in,
where you are, who you are.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,840
The forces at play here.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,720
Taxes, victory parades,
you think that's why I'm here?

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,320
I'm fighting a different war.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,680
The last war.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,600
And in that war, I'm in charge.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,720
And I always was.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,720
The journey ahead
is the journey into darkness.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,080
Druids may not survive.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,080
Did you miss me, brother?

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,440
I will find her.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,840
-Do you doubt Veran?
-Do you never doubt Veran?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,320
Can I stop you there?

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,200
Is that the same Veran,
who sacrificed my father,

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,440
and passed me over
as king of my tribe?

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,560
Kneel!

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,160
You are Queen Kerra of the Cantii.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,640
We should've kept her with us.

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,840
She's just a lamb.
She's not ready yet.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
-No.
-Oh, shit.

25

26
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,440
Hungry?

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,360
-They're yummy.
-I don't break bread with the dead.

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,400
Don't you just love the rain?

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,640
When you've seen
as many rainstorms as me,

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,160
you learn to read them.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,520
When they begin or end.

32
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,760
Look at that.
Do you not find that beautiful?

33
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,640
It's yummy. What do you want?

34
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
There's someone I want you to find.

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,000
Drink this.

36
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,360
And this. Drink it.

37
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,240
Rub this on your tummy.

38
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,080
Wait. It's the other way around.

39
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,480
<i>When I look out my window</i>

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,360
<i>Many sights to see</i>

41
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,360
<i>And when I look in my window</i>

42
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,480
<i>So many different people to be</i>

43
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
<i>Oh, no</i>

44
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,320
<i>Must be the season of the witch, yeah</i>

46
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,160
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,080
<i>The rabbits running in the ditch</i>

48
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,440
<i>Beatnicks are out to make it rich</i>

49
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,680
<i>Oh, no</i>
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

50
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,000
Morning, Bridget.

51
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,200
Morning, Rolf.

52
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,960
You should get up. You have a busy day.

53
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
We could just stay here for a bit.

54
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,800
Rolf. Stop it.

55
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,680
-Where did you get that scar?
-It's not a scar. It's a burn.

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,760
What happened?

57
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,560
My father was a blacksmith.
I walked into a hot iron.

58
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,600
Were you lonely as a child?

59
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,600
Not especially, no. I had a sister.

60
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,880
You never said you had a sister.

61
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,400
We lost touch a few years ago.
After the invasion.

62
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,400
Do you think the Romans
will ever come here, to the North?

63
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,640
One day, maybe.

64
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,240
But for now, we're safe.

65
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,400
What's her name? Your sister.

66
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Her name is Kerra.

67
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
Do you worry about her?

68
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Kerra's much tougher than me.

69
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
She's a survivor.

70
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,640
Don't worry. Your little man
isn't ready to say hello just yet.

71
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,040
-She could be a girl.
-Trust me. He's a boy.

72
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,440
Tall and fine, just like his daddy.

73
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,320
-Morning, Rolf.
-Morning, Nyle.

74
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,960
-Morning, Ewan. Morning, Holt.
-Morning.

75
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,920
Ready for the big day?

76
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,680
-You need a hand, Rolf?
-You're all right, boys.

77
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,800
I've got this one.

78
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,720
Come on!

79
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,760
Come on.

80
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,440
-What's he doing?
-He's clueless. Look at him.

81
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,200
He's kind to our sister.
That's all I care about.

82
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,920
Honestly, boys, I got this.

83
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,600
Do you want to catch him
before winter comes?

84
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,280
Come on, brothers.

85
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,400
-Tell me the plan again.
-Ten pieces. No less than five.

86
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,960
-You sure you'll be all right?
-Stop worrying, Rolf.

87
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,560
-Start bidding at three.
-Five.

88
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,360
Five. Five.

89
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,200
-Six!
-Six. Anyone at six?

90
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,600
Come on, now. He's a lovely specimen.
He speaks seven languages.

91
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,200
Wherever he shits,
a fruit tree grows.

92
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,040
Ten!
-Ten, 11.

93
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,840
-Twelve.
-Thirteen.

94
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,360
Thirteen. Any more than 13?

95
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,240
Fourteen, 15, 16.

96
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,800
-Seventeen.
-Seventeen, 18.

97
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Twenty? On my life.

98
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,560
Bullshit. I've never got more than 15.

99
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,440
When you know
what you're doing.

100
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,840
Looks like drinks are on Rolf, eh?

101
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,040
Well, Rolf, it will be a good winter.

102
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,160
-You want a lift home?
-You boys head on.

103
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,440
I'm gonna have one more.

104
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,200
I'm proud of you, Rolf. Really.

105
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,800
These last couple of years
have been hard.

106
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,160
But I feel like I finally
found a home.

107
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,400
-Don't go kissing any girls now.
-Go on.

108
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,400
-Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
-Go on, go on!

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,320
-Come on! -No, I'm going home.

110
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,200
I've got to get home.

111
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,840
-Come on, handsome.
-All right. Just one dance.

112
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,720
Evening.

113
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,880
Finally, tonight, some relics
from the Southern Wars.

114
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,600
First up,
Once a queen of a mighty tribe.

115
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,880
She wore gold in her hair,
and the rivers flowed.

116
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,680
Her people were bounteous
and worshipful.

117
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,160
Then she broke bread with the Romans.

118
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,480
Now her kingdom is this filthy cage,
and she sucks cocks for bacon rind.

119
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,040
Her name is Queen Antedia,
The Cocksucker!

120
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,040
You're the fucking cocksuckers!

121
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,160
Tell me, sir, have you ever
fucked a queen?

122
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,000
Give me a wash, and she'll all yours.

123
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,640
Now, who will give me
three silver pieces?

124
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,760
-Three!
-Thank you, sir. I have three pieces.

125
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,040
Oh, come on, boys.
There's still some meat on her.

126
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,240
If you don't want to fuck her,
you could feed her to your pigs.

127
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,160
Four!

128
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,840
-Four pieces of silver.
-Here, boys, watch this.

129
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,680
You thirsty, sweetheart?

130
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,080
Delicious. Like sweet barley wine.

131
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,360
-Five pieces.
-I have five pieces.

132
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,880
Going once. Twice.

133
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,640
Sold! To the gentleman on my right.

134
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,760
Good luck, love.
I think you might need it.

135
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,280
The gods are dead. The gods are dead.

136
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,400
Next up, a rare lot, indeed.

137
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,920
From the same batch, a holy relic.

138
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,600
Daughter of a noble king,
chosen by mighty Veran himself.

139
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
She reigned
but for a handful of moons,

140
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,000
until she, too, betrayed
her tribe to the Romans.

141
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Well, now... Queen Kerra is here.

142
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,280
All that's left of her.

143
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,240
Now, who will give me five pieces?

144
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,440
Oh, come on, you arseholes.

145
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,400
You could put your coppers in it,
or help you to get to sleep at night.

146
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,640
-Six!
-I have six over here.

147
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,400
-Seven.
-Hey, love. Are you thirsty?

148
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,600
Not worth it!

149
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,280
-Ten.
-Hello.

150
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,240
What's this? We have a new bidder.

151
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,440
Ten pieces from the skinny chap
on my right.

152
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,080
-Eleven.
-Fifteen.

153
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,600
-Sixteen.
-Twenty.

154
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,720
Twenty silver pieces.
Going once. Twice.

155
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,560
Sold! To the gentleman here.

156
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Enjoy.

157
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,680
What's he gonna do with it?

158
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,120
The time has come
for us to divide our forces.

159
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,840
Drust, Bradan, Morac...

160
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,160
Head north to the mountain people.

161
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,080
Morcant, Raven,
east to the wide plains.

162
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,640
Rork, south to the coastal tribes.

163
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,080
Festle, Haran, west to the valleys.

164
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,920
-And where will you go, Veran?
-I go where the gods command.

165
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,480
If you have a strategy,
we should know it.

166
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,160
Travel by night.
Leave no trace of your passing.

167
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,560
The tribes are scared.
They fear the future.

168
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,800
Testify that which the gods command.

169
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,640
Light the fire, feed the flames.

170
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,480
Will you give your blood to write the
gods' will and defeat the Romans?

171
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,440
-Aye.
-Aye, Veran.

172
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,240
Aye, Veran.

173
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,800
At dawn.

174
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,720
I cannot go to him again.

175
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,720
You must.
Veran is sending the tribes to fight,

176
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,440
but they don't know
who they're up against.

177
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,160
The Dead Man has awakened,
and only Veran knows the truth.

178
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,560
-We... We need time.
-There is no time.

179
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,680
The Dead Man will not wait.

180
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,480
I am glad to see you fully recovered,
Emperor.

181
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm told I owe you my life.

182
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,360
The offending slave has confessed.

183
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,680
Seems he was captured by the Druids
and they turned his mind to theirs.

184
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,680
-It's happened before.
-You have the Emperor's gratitude.

185
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,280
In return, I issue this order.

186
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,720
You are to remain here in Britannia,
find these Druids and wipe them out.

187
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,080
-Do you understand?
-Perfectly.

188
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,000
Dimitius will remain.

189
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,560
You'll find him
a very diligent presence.

190
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Safe travels, Commander.

191
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,400
It seems the Emperor
had a lucky escape.

192
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,240
So it would seem.

193
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,080
This is Ania.

194
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,920
She fought many battles
for the Regni.

195
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,880
She has sacrificed much
for this tribe.

196
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,840
-She will travel with you.
-Welcome.

197
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Lord Veran.

198
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,760
You traveled for five moons
across the 13 plains

199
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,080
to bring us the will of the gods.

200
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,200
But there was something you saw.

201
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,520
Something you chose not to mention.

202
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,600
So why not tell us all now
what it was that you found?

203
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,920
-Careful, Rork.
-Did you forget?

204
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,160
-Did it slip your mind?
-I warn you.

205
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,480
If you take this path,
you cannot return.

206
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,120
Then save yourself.

207
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,480
Tell us all now what the gods
told you of the Dead Man.

208
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,960
-Dead Man?
-What?

209
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,800
Dead Man?

210
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,680
Willa, tell your brothers
and sisters what you know.

211
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,440
I... I...

212
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,560
Quane. You know it, too. Speak!

213
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,200
Come now. Where is your fealty
to your brothers and sisters?

214
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,880
If I lie, then say so.

215
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,440
I saw the Dead Man's sign.

216
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,680
-He speaks true.
-Are you certain?

217
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
I swear.

218
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,920
So, Second Man, tell us,
is not the Dead Man awakened?

219
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,200
-Do not question my ways.
-Answer me!

220
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
Do not question my ways!

221
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,200
-Are you not in league with Lokka?
-No.

222
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,400
Did you not meet
with the Roman general

223
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,520
and take him to meet our dead?

224
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,280
I did.

225
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,440
-Are you not Lokka?
-I am the Veran.

226
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,320
-You lie!
-I am the Veran. I will die the Veran!

227
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,720
On behalf of the Tribe of Iudocus
and the Black Skull,

228
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
I, Rork...

229
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,920
..challenge the Veran.

230
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,120
So be it.

231
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,920
If you ask me, you were lucky.

232
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,960
When my time came
to walk toward the Sacred Wind,

233
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,280
I broke both legs, my pelvis,
my ankle, my jaw, and four fingers.

234
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,440
I was pissing blood for a month.

235
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,960
I note you chose
not to mention that.

236
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
It's not about the flight.

237
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,320
It's about faith. Surrender.
Facing the impossible.

238
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,920
That explains why I feel an overwhelming
sense of achievement right now.

239
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,720
What are you staring at? Oh, I get it.

240
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,720
-I see.
-I haven't eaten for two fucking moons.

241
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,520
How many times do I have to tell you?
Do not curse in the Holy Delve.

242
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,320
The betwixt must pass through air,
fire, water, earth.

243
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,080
She must fast for two moons
between each journey.

244
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,200
Only then will she receive
the Great Vision.

245
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,280
Have you received any Great Visions
lately? Any visions at all? No?

246
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,480
Meanwhile, our legions of dead await.

247
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,560
But, hey, no pressure. Take your time.

248
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,880
-Please...
-Repeat after me.

249
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,520
"I await the Great Vision."

250
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,320
Say it.
-I await the Great Vision.

251
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,800
There.

252
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,800
Now, you know the rules.

253
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,120
When the moon fills, we must go
to the sacred weed beds and...

254
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
Cut the reeds with a silver sickle.

255
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,000
To weave the virgin's bed
for the next moon.

256
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,120
Then you can eat.

257
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,240
Hey.

258
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,560
I get it. I did this years ago.

259
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,600
-I was a Druid before you were born.
-Briefly.

260
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,320
The Prophecy of Veran
is the most important prophecy

261
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,520
in the history of this land.

262
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,400
And who did Veran trust with it?

263
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,320
This is your path, and you must walk it.

264
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,080
Only you.

265
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,360
Bridget?

266
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,400
Rolf? Where have you been?

267
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,280
We've been waiting all night
to surprise you.

268
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,480
-It's a boy.
-Three cheers for Rolf!

269
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,440
What kept you, brother? No matter.
Daddy's home now.

270
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah.

271
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,360
I... I don't have the words to express
how I feel right now.

272
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,400
The first-born son is a sacred son.

273
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,080
The first-born son is a sacred son.

274
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,440
May he walk the earth
with the protection of the gods.

275
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,480
May he walk the earth
with the protection of the gods.

276
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,400
From this day, Rolf,
this child is your arrow.

277
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,880
May he soar out over the forest
and into the open sky.

278
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,400
You must give him a name, so that
when the Druids come to bless him,

279
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,200
he will be known to the lakes
and the mountains

280
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,200
and the mighty sky beyond.

281
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,880
This is truly a blessed day
for you, Rolf. So much bounty.

282
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,760
I want my son to be named after somebody
who is good and strong,

283
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:44,560
and noble, handsome, funny, and honest.

284
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,520
His name will be Rolf.

285
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,160
-All hail the Druids!
-The Druids!

286
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,400
All hail the Druids.

287
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,000
Veran?

288
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,040
Please. Forgive me.

289
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,360
-I didn't... Quane...
-Quane has fled.

290
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,600
-And you too must leave.
-But I...

291
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
You have betrayed me.

292
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,760
When this is over,
you must leave the Druids.

293
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,520
-You are outcast.
-Please, Veran!

294
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,000
-Why have you lied to us?
-Go!

295
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,480
The gods decree if one of the Twelve
challenges Veran,

296
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,800
then there is mortal combat.

297
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,680
The true Veran will cut the head
from the other.

298
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I just couldn't be happier.

299
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,480
Bridget, there's something
I need to tell you.

300
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,200
What's wrong?

301
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,760
My name is not Rolf.

302
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
My name is Phelan.

303
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,680
-Phelan of the Cantii.
-What?

304
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,480
Son of Pellenor. I'm a prince.

305
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,320
I don't understand.

306
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,440
It's a long story.

307
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,440
I was born royal.

308
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,440
My father, King Pellenor,
he was a good man.

309
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,040
But he was cold,
and ruled without mercy.

310
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,560
When I was nine,
my father had my mother sacrificed,

311
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,680
at the behest of the Druids.

312
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,160
She had Roman blood, you see.

313
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,200
When the Romans returned,

314
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,560
the Druids decided that it was he
who should be sacrificed.

315
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,600
Pellenor, I mean.

316
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,280
Then the Druids chose my sister
over me to rule in his stead.

317
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,480
I thought I was part of a prophecy...

318
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,760
To do with Brenna,
the goddess of war...

319
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,080
That didn't pan out.
And so, I decided...

320
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,200
I decided to start again.

321
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,360
I ran away. I changed my name.
I came here.

322
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,440
I met you in the forest.

323
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
What the fuck are you talking about?

324
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm telling you I'm not Rolf.
I'm not a farmer.

325
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,520
-I don't know a thing about farming.
-Don't believe you.

326
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,960
-It's true.
-You don't know farming?

327
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,960
Then explain how you sold a bullock
you raised for 20 silver pieces.

328
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,040
Right. Right.
You see, that's the other thing.

329
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,760
-I don't understand.
-The 20 silver pieces.

330
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,680
-I don't have it.
-What? Where is it?

331
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,120
-I spent it.
-You spent it?

332
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,800
Last night, at the market,
there was an auction.

333
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
What were they selling?

334
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,200
My sister's head.

335
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,480
And I bought it.

336
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,480
-You bought your sister's head?
-Yes.

337
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,600
How much did you pay for it?

338
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,760
Twenty silver pieces.

339
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
What about our baby?

340
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,480
I'm so sorry, Bridget. I'm so sorry.

341
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,960
I tried to run away, to flee my destiny.

342
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,880
But last night, at the market,

343
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,240
I understood something
for the first time.

344
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,280
What did you understand?

345
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,040
The Druids said the gods
have a fate for us.

346
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,840
That I must find mine.
That there is a light.

347
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,960
And it was my task to find it
and to protect it,

348
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,040
and to help it grow into a raging fire.

349
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,480
Last night, I was given a second chance.
It wasn't chance, it was destiny.

350
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,360
It was my sister.

351
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,080
All the gods telling me that there
was something I needed to do.

352
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,000
Holt, Holt! Get out here.

353
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,560
He's bought his sister's head.

354
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,800
Oh, no.

355
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,240
Now you listen here. Your name is Rolf.

356
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,920
Husband to Bridget.
Father of little Rolf.

357
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,400
You're not a prince. There's no quest.

358
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,000
You're Rolf, the fucking farmer.

359
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,600
-What's your name, boy?
-Phelan.

360
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,280
-What's your name?
-It's Phelan!

361
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,200
-What's your name?
-I am Phelan of the Cantii.

362
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,880
-What's your name?
-It's Phelan.

363
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

364
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Good night, Rolf.

365
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Good night, Bridget.

366
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,880
As Veran, you are the oak.

367
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,160
As challenger, you are the river.

368
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,680
May the gods speak!

369
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,160
The challenger strikes first!

370
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Let the gods speak.

371
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Peace be upon you, Druid.

372
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,960
I am the Veran!

373
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,960
I will show you the way!

374
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,920
Hero!

375
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,080
Hero! Hero!

376
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,080
Hero! Hero! Hero!

377
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,960
Hero! Hero!

378
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,760
Hero! Hero! Hero!

379
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,960
Goodbye, little prince.

380
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,440
Oh, my sister.
I wish I had half your strength.

381
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,160
But I won't let you down. I promise.

382
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,200
I'll do whatever it takes.

383
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,040
For I truly know now
that there is a light in this world.

384
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,800
There is a light...

385
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,480
What do they say?

386
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,920
They say you are the Veran.

387
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,720
Nothing more? Speak the truth.

388
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,880
A few whisper of trickery.
Of dark magic.

389
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,800
And what do you say?

390
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,080
I say the gods have spoken.

391
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,240
Leave me.

392
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,080
We're looking for stories,
fables, miracles.

393
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,520
This sort of thing spreads fast.
Take silver, loosen tongues.

394
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,880
So, a lone girl?

395
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,160
She may be with her teacher or mentor.

396
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,240
A small group. You know, followers.

397
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,760
Followers or disciples?

398
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,080
Now, now.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

399
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Have an apple.

400
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,160
They're yummy.

401
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,600
That's it. It's good, no?
Gobble, gobble.

402
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,160
-Who are you?
-I'm the apple man.

403
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,520
The man with the apples.
The Apple King.

404
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,280
I eat the apple and the pips fall
and grow into new trees,

405
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
which bloom and grow new apples,

406
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,000
I bring you the apple
and you gobble it up.

407
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,640
Gobble, gobble.

408
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,960
Slow down. Not so fast or you'll choke.

409
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,400
You're King Pellenor's son.

410
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,520
Your sister, Kerra, came to you
this moon. She found you.

411
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,160
You know the Druid Veran?
He who speaks for the gods?

412
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
-I do.
-Good.

413
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
There's something I want you to do.

414
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,880
What's your name?

415
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,480
Forgive me. That's so rude.

416
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,880
I've been alone such a long, long time,
and my manners just...

417
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,120
My name...

418
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,120
My name is Harka.

419
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,920
And how exactly, Harka,
do you fit into all this?

420
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,720
I am all of this.

420
00:42:00,305 --> 00:43:00,912
