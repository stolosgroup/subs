1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,880
All right, who wants to go first?

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,200
Britannia is a cursed land...

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,400
...ruled by the dead.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,640
In a few hours' time,

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,160
20,000 men...
will set sail to Britannia.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,400
You've come to occupy us?

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,480
We've come to work with you.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,480
You don't defeat these people
by fighting their warriors...

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,280
..you defeat them
by fighting their gods.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
Are you threatening the Druids?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,640
Guards of Britannia, I am Rome...

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,800
..and where I walk is Rome.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,640
We don't need you.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,080
We don't want you.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,160
You will stand down your army.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,080
-Go!
-No!

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,960
You can lick my crack.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,640
What's a Roman?

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,080
The Romans are devils.
They're the foot soldiers of Lokka...

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,240
..the Great Earth Demon.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,360
Well, that sounds scary, doesn't it?

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,640
-So, what's the mission?
-Isn't it obvious?

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,080
Stop the Romans, send them home,
kill the General.

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,560
Such a stupid question!

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,160
Fire!

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,320
Mighty Lokka...

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,800
Forward!

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,080
We are rising.

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,280
Do you have any idea...

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,680
..the power you're up against?

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,560
Come and get me, you fucking snake!

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,560
Take them!

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,760
Gods don't deal, Rome.
The gods don't deal.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,440
It is her.

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,040
Hope is the daughter
of a blind father.

36
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,400
It turns out, you're not a pointless
little pain in the arse.

37
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,280
It seems I was wro... wr... wr...
I was wro...

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,320
You were wr... wrong.

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,840
-Just shut your mouth.
-Thank you.

Out of my way! Move.

42
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,040
-Is he dead yet?
-Still going. He's drawing a crowd.

43
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,720
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

44
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,240
Let's stick one in him,
have an early supper?

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,160
Death by crucifixion.
It's in the orders.

46
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,120
-What about my orders?
-That happened first

47
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,600
-What did?
-We agreed.

48
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,000
Whoever was first
wouldn't be a prick.

49
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,240
Yeah. Come on...

50
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
..do the poor lad a favor.

51
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
All right.

52
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,480
Why are you people still here?
Nothing to see here. Bugger off!

53
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,760
<i>When I look out my window</i>

54
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,760
<i>Many sights to see</i>

55
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,840
<i>And when I look in my window</i>

56
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,040
<i>So many different people to be</i>

57
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,680
<i>Oh, no</i>

58
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,280
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

59
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,080
<i>Must be the season of the witch, yeah</i>

60
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,800
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

61
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,400
<i>You got to pick up every stitch</i>

62
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,200
<i>The rabbits running in the ditch</i>

63
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
<i>Beatnicks are out to make it rich</i>

64
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,480
<i>Oh, no</i>
<i>Must be the season of the witch</i>

65
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,560
Do you like what I've done
with the place?

66
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,960
All local stone.

67
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,760
The best part is I can come in here,
lie back

68
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,480
and the outside world
just disappears.

69
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,680
-I do love a bath.
-This was a sacred place.

70
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,000
These waters are warmed
by mighty Sulis.

71
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,360
Well, he's doing an excellent job.

72
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,720
This is a blessed day, Chieftains.

73
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,520
This day our emperor, your emperor,
is visiting this province.

74
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,720
Now, I'm sure I can trust you all...

75
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,680
Before we discuss your emperor,
we have grievances to air.

76
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,840
-Important grievances.
-Of course you do.

77
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I can smell the old bitch from here.

78
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,080
-I'm Queen Amena of the...
-We know who you are.

79
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
What do you want?

80
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,760
To pay respects to your mother,
the queen.

81
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,600
My mother loathed the Cantii.
You the worst.

82
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,160
A moon has passed,
yet still she lies unburied.

83
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,880
-We await the Druids.
-Then you clearly haven't heard.

84
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
The Druids have abandoned us.

85
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,280
-Vanished. Scattered to the winds.
-Liar.

86
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
-I told you...
-Shut your mouth!

87
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,560
If I'm wrong, where are they?

88
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,880
Why would Queen Amena
speak ill of the Druids?

89
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,320
Is it because the gods wouldn't,
in a thousand moons

90
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,040
put a crown upon her head.

91
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,080
And if they didn't, who did?

92
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,520
A Roman devil.

93
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,880
Twenty-feet tall, spitting fire,
with a big scaly dick.

94
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,640
You get a herring each...

95
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
..and then you leave.

96
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,680
It starts with taxes, then day
by day, they'll bleed you white.

97
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,120
It's true, the Romans tax.
But it's agreed.

98
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,920
Negotiated according to trade.

99
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Let them come.
Their heads will decorate our ramparts.

100
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,760
Derog... No!

101
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,080
-Listening to a Roman whore.
-This is about our future.

102
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,680
Fuck the future.

103
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,960
She's good on her back, this one,
and nothing more.

104
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,880
Now eat your fish and go.
Your lies are turning my stomach.

105
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Never easy, brothers.

106
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,280
-I am my brother's equal.
-Would the Druids agree?

107
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
When the time comes? Which it won't,
because they're not coming.

108
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,600
The problem here
isn't who sticks mom in the sea.

109
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,080
It's what happens next.
To you, your tribe...

110
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,920
Who would you have decide that?
A god?

111
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,480
A Druid? Or you?

112
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,040
Who is going to be king, Halwyn?

113
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
-That is for the gods to...
-Halwyn...

114
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,600
Who is going to be king?

115
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,400
Three families were killed
by your soldiers.

116
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
They were trying
to worship our god, Taranis.

117
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,320
I'm glad you bring it up.

118
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,760
Stopping such mix-ups
is why I've invited you all here.

119
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,240
-These are our lands, our gods.
-But you are part of the empire now.

120
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,880
We want you to be free to worship
your gods in any way you choose.

121
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,880
All we ask is you call them
something we recognize, a Roman name.

122
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,520
But the names of the gods are sacred.

123
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,640
-What's your wife's name?
-He has five wives.

124
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
-One will do.
-Vanna.

125
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,400
Vanna. So, Vanna comes home one night

126
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,720
and she says from now on,
she wants to be called Dudunda.

127
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,400
She still looks like Vanna,
talks like Vanna,

128
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,120
she's still warming your bed.

129
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,800
This Taranis of yours,
is the king of the gods.

130
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,520
Well, our king of the gods
is Jupiter.

131
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
How many arms does this Jupiter have?

132
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,360
Taranis has eight and six cocks.

133
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
How about Vulcan? He's quite a sight.

134
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,320
Fierce, lots of arms.
He'd be a match for Taranis.

135
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,440
-Does he have six cocks
-Wait. Stop, stop!

136
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,440
Are you pissing in my bath?

137
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
-No.
-You are. You are doing that face.

138
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,200
-I'm not.
-Nobody...

139
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,160
...pisses in my bath.

140
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,480
-Nobody.
-I swear by Taranis.

141
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Oh, I think you mean Vulcan.

142
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,520
I swear by Vulcan.

143
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,640
There. That wasn't so hard, was it?

144
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Forgive me, Mother.

145
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,080
You fool.

146
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
King Halwyn...

147
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Welcome to the future.

148
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,160
Come on, lads.

149
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,880
General?

150
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,160
We won't find the girl this way.
We need to widen the net.

151
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,800
General, the emperor's caravan
approaches.

152
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,920
Thank you, Decanus.

153
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,600
Go to the villages,
every settlement in the territory.

154
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,080
Knock on doors.

155
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,120
-What shall I do with the captives?
-Get rid of them.

156
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,640
-Queen Amena.
-Perfectis.

157
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,400
I want 100 horsemen
ready by nightfall.

158
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,520
Aye, General.

159
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,880
-You have a new ally.
-Defed...

160
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,640
Derog. Derog of the Demetae.

161
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,760
Halwyn of the Demetae.

162
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,680
-Isn't he the stupid brother?
-Well, now he's the useful brother.

163
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,360
-I thought we were going for Derog.
-Derog wasn't king material.

164
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,400
-Derog's a warrior. A legend.
-Derog's dead.

165
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Oh, that does tip things
in Halwyn's favor.

166
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm sure he'll do an excellent job.

167
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,120
-A hundred horsemen.
-Excuse me?

168
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,200
I couldn't help overhearing. Exciting.

169
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,560
Is there something afoot?

170
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,120
Now, now. Just because
we share a bed...

171
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,200
I wasn't prying.

172
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,240
I just feel as your ally,
has someone upset you?

173
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,840
Are you going to ride in
and burn their village?

174
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,960
Who, me?

175
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,120
You misunderstand me, Your Majesty.

176
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm looking for something.

177
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
Something that belongs to me.

178
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Something I want very, very badly.

179
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,640
And what do you want very, very badly?

180
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,120
I'll tell you what
I don't want right now.

181
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Emperor Claudius, welcome to Britannia.

182
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,280
I trust your journey
was a pleasant one.

183
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,960
The whole country's a toilet.
Where's your physician?

184
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,480
-Physician, my Lord?
-Yes, man. A doctor.

185
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,160
Is my Emperor unwell?

186
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,200
Comfy, they said, fit for a god.

187
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,640
That fat beast's got a backbone
like a battering ram.

188
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,240
I've been on it for five-fuck-arse
minutes, I've got the shakes,

189
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,640
the voices, my head is on fire,
and I've got piles to my fucking ankles.

190
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,560
Commander, a physician. Now!

191
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,760
Fucking Jupiter!

192
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,680
-Take care, would you?
-I'm doing my best.

193
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,920
So, come on. What have I missed?

194
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,000
All Cantii and Iceni lands are pacified.

195
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,880
Rebels fled north, the Ninth pursued
and annexed any sympathetic tribes.

196
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,760
My apologies, Caesar.

197
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,320
Our control of Britannia
now stretches from the southern coast

198
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,120
to Lindum Colonia in the north,
to the mountains.

199
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,920
-Meanwhile the Atrebates...
-Fucking...

200
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,560
I tell you this arse is shot.

201
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,760
I'm thinking of closing it
and opening a new one nearby.

202
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,200
A thousand miles.
Province after dull fucking province.

203
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,280
Little did I know,
I'd swap them all for this place.

204
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,640
In the pantheon of "Right Shit Holes",
Britannia is up there.

205
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,680
Britannia is strange, my Lord.
First you think, "This is a bit weird."

206
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,680
But slowly, very slowly it grows on you.
You watch.

207
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,720
Hm. Fuck arse! What's this?

208
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Ah! The locals wish to consecrate
a temple in your honor.

209
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,520
-Is that it?
-So far. Yes.

210
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,640
Domitius, write this down,

211
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,640
"The temple was hewn from marble.

212
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,200
400 cubits by 800-fuck-arse-cubits,
trimmed in silver and alabaster."

213
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,280
Yes, Lord Caesar.

214
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,680
Why isn't this place finished?
You've been here two years.

215
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,120
The invasion is proving a little more
arduous than we'd hoped.

216
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,480
The road to glory is a long one.

217
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Speaking of long roads,
you're going home.

218
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,160
My Lord?

219
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm to be given a triumph,
the conquering of Britannia.

220
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,920
You're my mascot. The golden boy.

221
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,080
-Big show, you'll enjoy it.
-I'm being recalled to Rome?

222
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,040
-Don't sound too grateful.
-Indeed, Lord Caesar, it's just...

223
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
-The resistance here is...
-No buts, General.

224
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,400
Your work here is done.
Congratulations. You're going home.

225
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,840
-Who's this?
-Queen Amena of the Cantii.

226
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,760
One of our most loyal
and obedient allies.

227
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,880
My Lord Caesar. Such an honor.

228
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,120
There it is. My silver house.
At least something here is ready.

229
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,800
-How do I look?
-Imperious.

230
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,840
Divine, my lord.

231
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,360
Come now, Queen Amena.
Divine is a trifle strong.

232
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,440
Are you not a god, Lord Caesar?

233
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,640
Of course, I'm a fucking god.
You saw me. I was on an elephant.

234
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,120
You looked celestial.

235
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,360
It's critical we explain to the emperor

236
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,560
I need to stay
when he returns to Rome.

237
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
The emperor is adamant.
You're central to his triumph.

238
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,040
-The jewel in his crown.
-Very flattering,

239
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,480
but there won't be a triumph
if I don't remain here.

240
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,760
-And why is that?
-The Druids.

241
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,880
-Druids...
-The Druids, my Lord...

242
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,360
The Druids are the force in this land.

243
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,040
They control the hearts
and minds of the people.

244
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,800
-How?
-With magic.

245
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Magic?

246
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,240
I don't care if it's real.

247
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
The point is the people believe it
and they will kill for it.

248
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,800
-I've established relations...
-Do you want to see some magic, General?

249
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,960
See this? Just shiny metal.

250
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
But everyone believes in it.

251
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,040
They'll work their lives away.
Betray friends. Kill.

252
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,360
I have more legions
than any emperor ever commanded.

253
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,000
But my greatest weapon?

254
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,320
Save your tales of "Magic"
for the Senate.

255
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,840
They will add such spice to my Triumph.

256
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,080
Nothing. He just sits there.

257
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,240
Come. He must not be disturbed.

258
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,800
Night after night, we dance to help
Veran hear the god's will and for what?

259
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,360
Must we wait
until the forests are all raped?

260
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,280
The land, the desert.
When will they speak to him?

261
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,400
Do you doubt Veran?

262
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Do you never doubt Veran?

263
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Why did he let the girl go?

264
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,560
We had her.

265
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,640
We could've protected her. Schooled her.

266
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,600
She would've grown strong
and now where is she?

267
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,720
Out there alone. With a mad man.
With Pwykka.

268
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,400
I brought my people more than 200 miles.

269
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,200
Why did he let the girl go with her?
Why?

270
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,400
You hated me when I first came.

271
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,960
You were a pain. A spoilt little baby.

272
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,520
-Were you a goddess or a princess?
-I was confused.

273
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,760
You're still confused.

274
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,080
-Ow!
-These don't flow.

275
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,480
These are backwards.
You're better than this. Focus.

276
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
The second man has returned.

277
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,920
For five moons, we have gathered
to know the god's will.

278
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
It is time.

279
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:39,120
Time for the trees to become arrows.
The stones, spearheads.

280
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,960
The meadows, lakes of fire.

281
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,920
The moon will find Lokka where he hides

282
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,080
and the sun will burn out his eyes.

283
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,600
The time has come
for the druids to fight.

284
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,720
There is one who walks this land,
sent by the gods.

285
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,080
A child. Only through her
shall this land be saved.

286
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,840
She must pass many trials.

287
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,280
But if she is indeed
the child of the gods,

288
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,040
she will grow stronger than kings,
wiser than druids,

289
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,920
and she will lead us into the light.

290
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Our faith has been rewarded.

291
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
The true path shown.

292
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,960
The truth is, I...

293
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,080
I never felt so afraid.

294
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,680
Earlier, I went into Veran's cave.

295
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
There on the ground I...

296
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,560
-I saw something.
-What did you see?

297
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,520
It was drawn in the dust.

298
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,120
Quane. Quane, tell me.

299
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,160
The snake...
with the sign of the dead man.

300
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,600
The horsemen are ready, General.
All one hundred.

301
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,520
Stand them down till morning.
I've got bigger problems.

302
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,640
Queen Amena. Why don't you
tell us more about these druids?

303
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,720
The one the general is so afraid of.

304
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,640
The druids are whores.
Their time is over.

305
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,760
See, General? And she should know.

306
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,320
The druids have power
over the rebel tribes.

307
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,400
If that power finds a focus,

308
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,120
Domitius will be writing
a very different story.

309
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,720
Do you take me for a scribe, General?
I am no scribe.

310
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,240
Then what are you, Domitius?

311
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,440
His father is a very powerful senator.

312
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,480
-Well, I just won a bet.
-Now, now, General.

313
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,920
He is my eyes and ears.
You should beware him.

314
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,120
Look at him, squirming like a squid.

315
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,280
My generals love to think
they're special.

316
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,480
Like prize bulls.

317
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,400
They have rings through their noses
though, for me to tug on.

318
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,920
What do you think of my prized bull,
Amena?

319
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,760
-General Aulus is a great man.
-But not a god, eh?

320
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,280
Lord Caesar, I beg you
to reconsider my posting.

321
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,600
The very fate of the occupation
is at stake.

322
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,840
I've been many places,
fought many battles for the Empire.

323
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,760
The battle, the true battle
does not always unfold upon the field.

324
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,280
Defeat a hundred armies.
Subdue a continent. Sometimes...

325
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,680
...it is the one man you need to fear.

326
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,520
The one who can stir the dead...

327
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,200
...tear down temples...

328
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
...shift the pillars of time.

329
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,200
That's where the true danger lies.

330
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,600
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

331
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,800
Do you remember Golgotha, General?

332
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,160
The place of skulls.
Ten or 15 years ago.

333
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I remember it.

334
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,000
What of it?

335
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,840
Well, I must say, General,
you, sir, are a total mystery.

336
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,160
Here we are, a dank, gray hell pit
on the edge of the world...

337
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,240
-No offense.
-None taken.

338
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,120
And you're fighting
tooth and bollocks to stay.

339
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,960
I wonder what can be
keeping him here, eh, Amena?

340
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,040
To going home. Eh, General?

341
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,760
-To going home.
-Home, Lord Caesar.

342
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,840
Let me show you a little bit of home.

343
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Sit, child.

344
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
We must prepare to leave this place.

345
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,840
Now the gods have spoken.
There's no time to lose.

346
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,760
-You should try to sleep.
-I've been asleep for months.

347
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,000
It's good to smell the air, the breeze.

348
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,040
The journey ahead
is a journey into darkness.

349
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,160
The Druids may not survive...

350
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,800
..but we must ensure
that the light prevails.

351
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,920
Veran...

352
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
Was there anything else you saw?

353
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,640
What do you mean?

354
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,720
Other visions, other... signs?

355
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,440
The way is revealed to Veran alone.
and Veran reveals the way.

356
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,720
-Yes, of course...
-There is no road back. Speak, child.

357
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,160
Quane said he saw something...

358
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
...drawn in the dirt.

359
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,280
-A sign.
-Quane was mistaken.

360
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
There was no sign.

361
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,160
-Fit for an emperor?
-It will most certainly do.

362
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,680
-How about a god?
-Now, now, you know the new rules.

363
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,720
The Senate can't hear us
all the way over here.

364
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,280
I know it. You know it.
The gods know it.

365
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,120
You're a divine. Go on, I dare you.

366
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,000
All right then. I'm a god.

367
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,440
-Louder.
-I'm a god!

368
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,720
-Bollocks. A toast!
-Excuse me?

369
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,200
-To your divine victory.
-My divine victory.

370
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
You see, it isn't your victory.

371
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,560
It isn't your victory
because it isn't your war.

372
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,160
-What did you say?
-Having trouble hearing?

373
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,760
-Seeing?
-I've drunk too much. I don't feel well.

374
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,560
That's because
I've poisoned your wine.

375
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
It's all right.

376
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,920
Don't be scared.

377
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Soon you'll fall asleep.

378
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,720
But before you do, know this.

379
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,440
You are not a god.

380
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,400
You are a fat, inadequate,
slobbering mark.

381
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,320
A stand-in.

382
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,240
I... I don't feel very well.

383
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,360
You have no idea what game you're in.

384
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,440
Where you are, who you are.
The forces at play here.

385
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,960
Taxes, victory parades.
You think that's why I'm here?

386
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm fighting a different war.

387
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,360
The last war.

388
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,360
And in that war, I'm in charge...

389
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,360
..and I always was.

390
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Let me introduce myself.

391
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
I am Hell.

392
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,600
Where I walk... is Hell.

393
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,160
Guards! Guards!

394
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,280
-Keep him like that.
-Yes, General.

395
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
-Close the perimeter. No-one leaves.
-All right, General.

396
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,560
-What happened?
-The emperor has been poisoned.

397
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Stop! You'll kill him.

398
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,840
The sign of the snake
has not been seen for 10,000 years.

399
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,760
I don't understand. Why would Veran lie?

400
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Can you hear me?

401
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Can you hear me, brother?

402
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Did you miss me, brother?

403
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,400
Well, I'm back.
So listen very carefully now.

404
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,440
I will find her.

405
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,480
We should've kept her with us.
We could've protected her.

406
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,560
She's just a lamb.
She... She's not ready yet.

407
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,200
Today...

408
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,360
No. No, no, no... No, no, no...

409
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,880
Oh, shit.

409
00:41:04,305 --> 00:42:04,637
