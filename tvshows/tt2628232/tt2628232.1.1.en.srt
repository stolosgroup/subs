Mum?

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,300
Mum?

00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:15,332
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum.

7
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,166
Benedicta tu in mulieribus,

8
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,599
et benedictus fructus
ventris tui, Lesus.

9
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,467
Sancta Maria, mater Dei,

10
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:24,332
ora pro nobis peccatoribus,

11
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,332
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.
Amen.

12
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,632
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum.

13
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:34,666
Benedicta tu in...

14
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:27,333
<i>Soon, child, soon.</i>

15
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,699
<i>I'm hungry...</i>

16
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:48,073
__

17
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,933
Just about then...

18
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:52,699
I seen big old Crazy Horse himself,

19
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,266
riding up with his band
of bloodthirsty Sioux killers.

20
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,133
Applaud the man!

21
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:13,699
General Custer gave the word,

22
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,699
his blond hair flapping in the breeze

23
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,632
like something from myth.

24
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:23,899
Says he: "Stand here and fight, boys,
fight for your very lives!"

25
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,732
And so fight I did.

26
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,666
One of the few survivors who lived

27
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:38,066
to bring you this tale
of pluck and daring.

28
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:46,032
Thanks for coming out today

29
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,899
and I hope that I have found
some favor among you

30
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,666
estimable gentlemen...and ladies.

31
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,017
Yeah!

32
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:11,299
Yeah!

33
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,632
Will I see you again?

34
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,267
No.

35
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,066
Would that I could.
Show's heading off to Paris.

36
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:30,066
So many details to attend to...
You understand.

37
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,066
The life of a theatrical gentleman
is peripatetic, darlin'.

38
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,517
But I was under...

39
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,232
Just know that you have made
my visit here truly memorable.

40
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,967
I shall never forget you.

41
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,699
Perhaps you'd like to know
my name then.

42
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:04,517
__

43
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,332
You didn't tell the truth.

44
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,632
By my reckoning, you were a boy
when General Custer died

45
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,099
and 'tis well known
there were no survivors.

46
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,132
What we call a tall tale, darlin'.

47
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,567
Exceedingly tall.

48
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,866
Vice of my nation.
We're storytellers.

49
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,233
Join me, won't you?

50
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,766
You saw my exhibition?

51
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:29,966
Highly impressive,
especially your finale.

52
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,667
Well, you gotta leave them
wanting more,

53
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,900
as we say in show business.

54
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,932
And what might I do for you?

55
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:43,367
- I have a need for some night work.
- Oh, honey, don't we all?

56
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,699
I have a need for a gentleman
who's comfortable with firearms

57
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,699
and not hesitant to engage
in dangerous endeavors

58
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,632
or was all that a tall tale as well?

59
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,633
What do you think?

60
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:02,066
Expensive watch,
but threadbare jacket.

61
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,932
Sentimental about the money
you used to have.

62
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,766
Your eye is steady,
but your left hand tremors.

63
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:09,932
That's the drink,

64
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:13,199
so you keep it below the table,
hoping I won't notice.

65
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,066
You have a contusion healing
on your other hand,

66
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:20,332
the result of a recent brawl
with a jealous husband, no doubt.

67
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:25,332
Your boots are good quality leather,
but have been resoled more than once.

68
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,866
I see a man who's been
accustomed to wealth,

69
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,932
but has given himself to excess

70
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:33,799
and the unbridled pleasures of youth.

71
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,416
A man much more complicated

72
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,833
than he likes to appear.

73
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,166
So, it's a job, this "night work?"

74
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,266
Yes.

75
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,666
Something of a criminal setup?

76
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,032
Would it matter?

77
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,366
- Not at all.
- Then why ask?

78
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,490
Show's heading off to Paris,
pretty soon.

79
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,142
The job's tonight.

80
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,067
- Is it a murder?
- Would it matter?

81
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,300
One smile and I say yes.

82
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,767
Meet me at this address
at eleven o'clock.

83
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:22,966
- I don't know London.
- Then ask a policeman.

84
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,166
You have a name?

85
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,168
Yes.

86
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,850
Clear off, Johnny!

87
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,932
Mr. Chandler.

88
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,533
I didn't expect you to be on time.

89
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,466
Oh, I never keep a lady waiting.

90
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,366
Very wise. This way please.

91
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:10,366
- This is the individual?
- Yes.

92
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,933
Did you bring your weapons?

93
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,999
One-one minute.

94
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:23,440
What're we doing here?

95
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:24,700
We're looking for someone.

96
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,299
More than that,
you don't need to know.

97
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,099
Do not be amazed at anything you see

98
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
and don't hesitate.

99
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,599
Who exactly are we looking for?

100
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,166
Someone very dear to me
who's been taken.

101
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:18,032
That which you serve, we seek.

102
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:58,566
Where is she?

103
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,833
Little girls shouldn't play
with toys like that.

104
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,267
Where is your master?

105
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,884
Closer than you think.

106
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,499
Would you like to meet him?

107
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,500
It's not her.

108
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:01,300
Agghhh!

109
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:29,667
She's not here.

110
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:33,907
There must be another.

111
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:35,367
Another creature?

112
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,367
Is there another?

113
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,632
Is there another creature like that?

114
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:43,332
Jesus Christ!

115
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,980
Don't move, Mr. Chandler.
This night's not over.

116
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:47,999
Help us, please.

117
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,267
What is this place?

118
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,566
Where the resurrection men
ply their trade.

119
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,266
The surgeons must supply their
students with ample subjects.

120
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,700
When the legal channels
are exhausted,

121
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:18,266
they're forced to resort
to other means.

122
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:19,924
I'm in need of your services, sir.

123
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,000
Tisn't from the river?

124
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:22,767
They're useless
once them fishes got 'em.

125
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,932
Not the river, no.

126
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,600
Well, that's a blessing.

127
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:28,933
Bring it round the back and see
if my assistant can take you.

128
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,332
Your master said you might assist us.

129
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,667
I have no master.

130
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,067
The proprietor out front, I mean.

131
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,233
- Go away.
- I'll pay you for your time.

132
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:53,932
- You'd not afford it.
- You're very proud.

133
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,933
Take it to a slaughterhouse.
I'm not a medical practitioner.

134
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,399
I'm engaged in research.

135
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,366
You're a man with a bloody knife
like everybody else out there,

136
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,699
so stop putting on airs.

137
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,967
American?

138
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:05,232
You are clever.

139
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,200
Do you know anything
about electrical currents?

140
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:08,500
Your country is making such strides

141
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:11,332
as we labor in the dark ages
of coal and peat.

142
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,633
Have you any experience
with the principles

143
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:14,932
and applications of galvanism?

144
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,366
Oh, the usual.

145
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,332
Sir, I have urgent need of an necropsy.
Will you assist us?

146
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,932
I am occupied solely in research.

147
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,702
I will not bore myself
with explanations

148
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:25,054
you could not possibly understand.

149
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:28,333
Now, kindly, stop wasting
my time and get out!

150
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:42,167
My God.

151
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,517
Lividity, null.

152
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,799
Rigor mortis, null.

153
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Notable ocular hyperemia.

154
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:52,799
Ocular reaction, null.

155
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,332
Dental malformation,

156
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,466
not naturally occurring
due to the isotropy.

157
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:57,984
Nature's rarely so neat.

158
00:19:57,985 --> 00:19:59,499
Nature abhors symmetry.

159
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,167
Trauma and penetration
of the chest cavity

160
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,278
through the manubrium
seems the likely cause of death,

161
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:05,432
but I expect you know that.

162
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:08,432
Age of the subject
is impossible to determine.

163
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:11,917
The teeth seem barely used,
which seems unlikely given the...

164
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,700
muscular development.

165
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,566
The dermis is unusual.

166
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,550
Seems to lack the normal
cutaneous eccrine pores.

167
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,467
Hand me that.

168
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:34,766
Well, I know why
the skin seems peculiar.

169
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:35,800
Why?

170
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,832
Forceps.

171
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,833
Because it isn't skin.

172
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,832
Not as we know it.

173
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,883
It's more like a...

174
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:44,932
tensile exoskeleton,

175
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,933
along the lines of an insect
or crustacean.

176
00:20:46,936 --> 00:20:48,867
He must have been a hearty devil.

177
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,966
You're not kidding.

178
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,900
Hold on, what's this?

179
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,666
Fascinating.

180
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,832
Hieroglyphics.

181
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,767
Egyptian?

182
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:03,700
Undoubtedly.

183
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,867
Well, it would appear

184
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,633
you have an Egyptian man
of no particular age,

185
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,400
who, at some point
in his indeterminate lifespan,

186
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,467
decided to sharpen his teeth,
cover himself in hieroglyphics

187
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,932
and grow an exoskeleton.

188
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,933
Or you have something else altogether.

189
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,033
Who the fuck are you people?

190
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,466
Do you know Grandage Place
in Westminster?

191
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,632
I can find it.

192
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:33,799
Number eight.
Come at noon tomorrow.

193
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,767
Unless you'd rather spend
the rest of your life

194
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,432
shooting clay targets
and telling lies.

195
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,766
No, no, she's gone!

196
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,600
Says she heard something last night.

197
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,700
Really?

198
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:53,067
But she didn't see nothing.

199
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,250
Carnage.

200
00:21:58,251 --> 00:21:59,799
Sir?

201
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,932
It's like a battlefield.

202
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,367
You want it all?

203
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,700
Everything.

204
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,452
Even her?

205
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:09,132
Especially her.

206
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,125
Doesn't seem right.

207
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:12,799
Where's the dignity in that?

208
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,467
We'll get her dignity back
when we've caught this monster.

209
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,200
Ethan Chandler to see Sir Malcolm.

210
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,366
I'm expected.

211
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,367
Come in.

212
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:15,066
Wait here, please.

213
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,933
Not what you expected?

214
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,817
You've a light step, miss.

215
00:23:49,818 --> 00:23:52,432
Or is it ma'am?

216
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:55,899
Miss Vanessa Ives.

217
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,667
Come this way, won't you?

218
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,199
May I offer you some tea?

219
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,667
No thanks.

220
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,332
So you're a fortune reader?

221
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,867
The term is inadequate.

222
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,899
- Spiritualist?
- If you like.

223
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,832
Rapping on the table?
Voices from the great beyond?

224
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,083
Not precisely.

225
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:26,332
You're a skeptic.

226
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,021
Not about everything.

227
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:30,132
Last night, for example.

228
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:33,099
And you want an explanation?

229
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,100
I think I should see Sir Malcolm.

230
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,400
I can speak for him.

231
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:48,099
Do you believe there is
a demimonde, Mr. Chandler?

232
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,299
A half world between
what we know and what we fear?

233
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,732
A place in the shadows,
rarely seen, but deeply felt.

234
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:00,966
Do you believe that?

235
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,300
Yes.

236
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,766
That's where we were last night,

237
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:13,666
where some unfortunate souls
are cursed to live always.

238
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:16,666
If you believe in curses, that is.

239
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:26,832
Are you a wise man, Mr. Chandler?

240
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,232
Not especially.

241
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,133
A wise man would walk away
from this house

242
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:34,266
and make a concerted effort to forget
everything that occurred last night.

243
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:35,732
He would not look back.

244
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,166
That sounds like a warning.

245
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,899
It's an invitation.

246
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,966
Should you be so unwise
as to entertain the idea,

247
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:45,832
we have continued use
of a man of your skills.

248
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:46,999
Your kind of man.

249
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,200
And what kind is that?

250
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:52,399
One of great violence
and hidden depths.

251
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,699
You play your role well,
Mr. Chandler,

252
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,700
but this is not who you are.

253
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,333
Tell me what this is all about.

254
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,732
Sir Malcolm's daughter
was taken by a creature

255
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:12,199
such as the one we killed.

256
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,099
We didn't suspect there was another.

257
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,399
There's much we don't know
and must discover.

258
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,832
And what's your part in all this?

259
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,333
My part is my own.

260
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:33,199
I've been a hired gun before.

261
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,766
Doesn't suit me.

262
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,999
There's no exaltation
in killing for gold.

263
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,832
A wise man after all.

264
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,832
Sembene has your money at the door.
He'll show you out.

265
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,833
I hope you enjoy your life
as an actor.

266
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:48,299
It seems to be what you're suited for.

267
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,766
But if you find yourself
in that demimonde we spoke of,

268
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,366
and seek to escape it,

269
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,000
you know my address.

270
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,999
And what do you seek to escape?

271
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,766
Perhaps the same thing you do.

272
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:08,167
We all have our curses, don't we?

273
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,833
Good day, Mr. Chandler.

274
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:15,067
Miss Ives.

275
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,766
Before you go,

276
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,899
one last task, if you'll indulge me:

277
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,000
pick a card.

278
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:31,099
No, no, not like that.
Not impulsively, not without thought.

279
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,432
Let them work on you.

280
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,917
Look into my eyes.

281
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:38,400
Believe.

282
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:05,116
__

283
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:16,966
Was he tempted?

284
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:18,433
Intrigued, I would say.

285
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:19,967
Then he'll be back.

286
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,032
- He's intending to leave town.
- He won't. We won't let him.

287
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:26,650
I'll require you in an hour.

288
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:29,266
We have an appointment.

289
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:31,067
Where are we going?

290
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Amongst dead things.

291
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:51,432
Mother and daughter
butchered in east end horror!

292
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:54,966
Westminster Guardian.
Only a penny!

293
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:58,676
Undone in Spitalfields.

294
00:28:58,777 --> 00:29:01,000
Police fear Ripper is back!

295
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,080
Sir...

296
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,466
Sir Malcolm Murray is outside.

297
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:13,599
<i>The</i> Malcolm Murray?

298
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,699
Oh...

299
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,966
I am extravagantly pleased.
Do show him in.

300
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,800
And stand up straight, Felix.

301
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,633
You look like an orangutan.

302
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:28,083
Mr. Lyle.

303
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:31,032
Sir Malcolm. Oh, it is you!

304
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:34,299
The photograph in your book
does you no justice, but do they ever?

305
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Say you'll inscribe it for me.
Say you will.

306
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:38,433
Your book, I mean.
And something deeply personal.

307
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:39,867
It would be a pleasure.

308
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:41,299
This is Miss Vanessa Ives.

309
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,099
Could I be more charmed?
No, I could not.

310
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,000
And what brings you
to the humble confines

311
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:49,332
of the Department of Egyptian
and Assyrian Antiquities?

312
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,033
Though, really, it's only Egyptian.

313
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:53,432
We don't quite approve
the Assyrians, do we?

314
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:54,732
Sit down, do.

315
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,217
What are these?

316
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:57,699
Oh, carrion beetles.

317
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,366
We employ them when the usual solvents
are deemed too abrasive.

318
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:04,532
They eat the flesh, don't you know.

319
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:07,132
Sorry, my dear, it's a bit
ghoulish to the lay-person.

320
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,432
Very exotic.
Where do they come from?

321
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,632
Actually, Waveney, in Suffolk.

322
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:14,332
Not exotic at all.

323
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:17,232
Mr. Lyle, I was hoping
you could assist me.

324
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,633
I've a bit of hieroglyphics
in need of translating.

325
00:30:25,413 --> 00:30:27,533
These aren't from a scroll.
What are they?

326
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:30,567
They're from a tattoo on a corpse.

327
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:35,299
Oh, that's outre.

328
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,066
What have you got for me then?

329
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,632
Late hieratic script.

330
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,850
18th dynasty, perhaps earlier.

331
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:44,066
It's a standard funerary text.

332
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,200
Conjoined in this fashion,
they translate roughly

333
00:30:51,203 --> 00:30:55,032
to an idea meaning "blood cure"
or "blood transformation."

334
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,333
Although there's a theory
it's something

335
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:58,599
more along the lines
of a malediction:

336
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,032
"A blood curse."

337
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:02,432
Trust me, those Egyptians
were a bit madcap

338
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:06,133
when it came to specifics.
It's all very metaphoric.

339
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,367
- Are there more of these?
- Yes.

340
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:27,466
I should like to see them,
but not here.

341
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:31,399
The British museum is no place
for actual scholarship, after all.

342
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,599
Perish the thought.

343
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,467
And before I engage
in professional matters,

344
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,699
I feel it is vital to engage
in social congress.

345
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,466
Get to know the sort of people
one is working with, you understand?

346
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:42,666
My wife and I entertain on occasion.

347
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,799
Lavishly, you can be sure,
as she's absurdly rich.

348
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,132
We're having a little fete,
Friday next.

349
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,567
Perhaps you and Miss Ives
could join us?

350
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,732
This is a matter of some urgency.

351
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,600
Good heavens, Sir Malcolm,

352
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:56,066
there hasn't been anything
urgent about the Egyptians

353
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,732
for 2000 years.

354
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:01,066
And I'm dreadfully busy now,
you understand.

355
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:04,699
Ever so many papyri to translate.

356
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,967
Isn't that a delicious word?

357
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,232
Papyri.

358
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:12,499
Sounds like something eaten
by little Persian boys, doesn't it?

359
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,633
So I shall see you Friday next.

360
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:18,199
As you say.

361
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,266
Grand. It's resolved.

362
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:22,256
Bring the rest
of the photographs with you

363
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,702
and we'll take a peek.

364
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:27,066
Entre nous, don't you know?

365
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,199
Such an infinite pleasure
meeting you both.

366
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,828
Our pleasure, Mr. Lyle.

367
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:32,300
Good day, good day.

368
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:35,300
I do assume you know
the source of the writing?

369
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,499
No.

370
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,700
It's from the Egyptian
Book of the Dead.

371
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,732
Keep clear.

372
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:08,399
Stay there.

373
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,232
Look at that blood.
Think they suffered much?

374
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:14,366
Bloody right, they did.
And that little girl too.

375
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,200
She was expecting another,
you know.

376
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:17,533
Don't say it.

377
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:20,144
Just starting to show.
Picking out names, she was.

378
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,700
Is it the Ripper come back?

379
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:23,700
Who else but old Jack?

380
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:27,566
Damn him that did it.
Right to hell.

381
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,766
I haven't seen him, Maud!

382
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:33,333
A delivery for you.

383
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,533
From Sir Malcolm Murray.

384
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:59,922
__

385
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:03,551
__

386
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,666
Concentrating around the north side,

387
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:16,899
and then moving slowly south, here.

388
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,700
That's right.

389
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,533
- Sir Malcolm.
- Doctor.

390
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,499
So you're the explorer?

391
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,766
I've made one or two
modest discoveries.

392
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,600
There's a Murray mountain
in the eastern regions

393
00:35:34,603 --> 00:35:37,966
of the Belgian Congo,
if you're ever in the vicinity.

394
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,967
Not the tallest mountain,
to be sure,

395
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:41,799
but not the smallest either.

396
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,466
Hmm.

397
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,832
I've spent most of my life
in Africa,

398
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,833
beholding wonders.

399
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,966
I was surprised to get your note.

400
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:53,800
You seem a man
who holds his secrets fast.

401
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,732
I wasn't going to come.

402
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:58,033
But you couldn't resist.

403
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,666
When you see a river,
you must follow it to its source,

404
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,650
no matter the perils,
no matter those comrades

405
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:09,466
that fall along the way.

406
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,917
You must know how things work.

407
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:14,366
You must unlock.

408
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,066
You are dissatisfied always.

409
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,799
Are you dissatisfied?

410
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,234
I'm seeking.

411
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:20,666
What?

412
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,066
Perhaps the same as you.

413
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,932
Mm, I seek the truth.

414
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,432
Ah, you're a very young man.

415
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,766
I've long since learned
that truth is mutable.

416
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,600
Perhaps we view science differently.

417
00:36:30,603 --> 00:36:32,433
- Do we?
- I would never chart a river

418
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:36,067
or scale a peak to take its measure
or plant a flag. There's no point.

419
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,432
It's solipsistic self-aggrandizement.

420
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,566
So too those scientists
who study the planets

421
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,099
seeking astronomical
enlightenment for its own sake.

422
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,132
The botanist studying the variegation
of an Amazonian fern.

423
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:50,167
The zoologist caught up
in the endless fascination

424
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:51,832
of an adder's coils.

425
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:55,466
And for what?

426
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:58,034
Knowledge for itself alone?

427
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:00,599
The elation of discovery?

428
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,999
Plant your flag on the truth?

429
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,734
There is only one worthy goal

430
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:09,466
for scientific exploration...

431
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:14,466
piercing the tissue that
separates life from death.

432
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,933
Everything else,
from the deep bottom of the sea

433
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:21,034
to the top of the highest mountain
on the farthest planet,

434
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:22,999
is insignificant.

435
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,499
Life and death, Sir Malcolm.

436
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,032
The flicker that separates
one from the other,

437
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:32,267
fast as a bat's wing,

438
00:37:32,268 --> 00:37:35,499
more beautiful than any sonnet.

439
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,700
That is my river.

440
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:39,900
That is my mountain.

441
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:45,666
There I will plant my flag.

442
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:48,200
You have the soul of a poet, sir.

443
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,000
And the bank account to match.

444
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,566
Now why did you want to see me,
Sir Malcolm?

445
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,234
You tell me.

446
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,899
Last night, of course.

447
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,432
The body you bought was not,
strictly speaking, human.

448
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:04,466
No.

449
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:06,033
- Did you kill him?
- Yes.

450
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:08,231
- Are there more?
- At least one.

451
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:09,575
And what is your goal?

452
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:11,699
To find a cure
for a most rare disease.

453
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,866
Hence, I'm in a position
to offer you employment.

454
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:16,399
You seem to be a freethinker
who might imagine a world

455
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,466
less constrained by what
we think we know of as "truth."

456
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,632
You mean the supernatural?

457
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:26,600
I mean that place where science
and superstition walk hand-in-hand.

458
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:32,766
An anatomist of your skill
would be invaluable to my work.

459
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,633
You'll be well paid.

460
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,866
I have no interest in joining
an amateur occultist society.

461
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:41,767
Nor I in forming one!

462
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,767
It is not a game for me.

463
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:51,632
Then stop playing as if it were.

464
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,033
What are you after?

465
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,467
I'm trying to rescue my daughter.

466
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:02,500
To save her,
I would murder the world.

467
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,532
Join me, doctor.

468
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:12,466
With me, you will behold
terrible wonders.

469
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:16,899
And how much of the world
will we have to murder?

470
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,733
Do you care?

471
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,684
I've only one other question:

472
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:25,466
why me?

473
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:28,952
Because you were unafraid
to pull back the skin

474
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:31,433
and look beneath.

475
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:01,566
Mina?

476
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:16,733
My God... Mina.

477
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:35,032
- You've no doubt?
- It was her.

478
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:37,066
Was it an appeal?

479
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,784
I don't know.

480
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,499
At first...

481
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,799
there was such a need in her eyes

482
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,278
and then something...

483
00:42:46,204 --> 00:42:48,580
monstrous.

484
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,937
My true friend would do you no harm.

485
00:42:52,038 --> 00:42:54,261
Our nature doesn't change,
only our circumstance.

486
00:42:54,362 --> 00:42:56,728
You don't know.

487
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,666
Don't I?

488
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,717
Was I not responsible?

489
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:06,367
But for my transgression,
would any of this have occurred?

490
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,966
We cannot unmake the past.

491
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:12,433
We shall live with our guilt,
you and I.

492
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:18,767
After all this time, she came to me.

493
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,433
I will find her.

494
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,866
There was another thought when
she was so very close to me,

495
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:34,867
a strange working of memory.

496
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:40,232
I thought of a particular
lion hunt many years ago.

497
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:43,499
You're moving through the tall grass,
getting a glimpse of the prey,

498
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,066
the shoulders mostly, the mane.

499
00:43:46,067 --> 00:43:48,150
You prepare your rifle.

500
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:50,232
You're very quiet.

501
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:54,099
And then there's a moment.

502
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:59,366
The wind changes,
the grass stops swaying.

503
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:01,993
The lion turns,

504
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:06,329
looks at you.

505
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:11,532
The moment you realize
you are no longer the hunter,

506
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:14,933
you are the prey.

507
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:22,068
Pater noster, qui es caelis,
sanctificetur nomen tuum.

508
00:45:22,169 --> 00:45:23,556
Adveniat regnum tuum.

509
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:26,386
Fiat voluntas tua,
sicut in caelo, et in terra.

510
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:29,061
Panem nostrum qotidianum
da nobis hodie,

511
00:45:29,162 --> 00:45:32,229
et dimittimus
nobis debitoribus nostris. Amen.

512
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,734
Sanctificetur nomen tuum.
Adveniat regnum tuum.

513
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:39,332
Et ne nos inducas in tentationem,
sed libera nos a malo. Amen.

514
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:43,622
Pater noster, qui es caelis,
sanctificetur nomen tuum.

515
00:45:43,723 --> 00:45:45,660
Adveniat regnum tuum.

516
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:48,362
Fiat voluntas tua,
sicut in caelo et in terra.

517
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:50,999
Panem nostrum quotidianum
da nobis hodie. Amen.

518
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:36,867
Ugh! Damn it!

519
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:11,850
Can you hear?

520
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:36,017
My name...

521
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:40,167
is Victor Frankenstein.

522
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:53,101
