00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,299
I bet you do. Pack up, okay?
Only what you wanna take.

161
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,062
I'll buy you anything else you need.

162
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,466
Okay-

163
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,218
You didn't reveal that I was awake.

164
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,149
We're not done talking yet.

165
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,986
You and Marcel seem very close.

166
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,823
Marcel is my family.

167
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,828
And yet Marcel is someone who
delights in harming the witches.

168
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,065
Those people, I would think,
you would consider family.

169
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,799
This doesn't trouble you?

170
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,304
No.

171
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,737
They deserve it.

172
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,333
Why would you say that?

173
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,912
'Cause they're liars, all of them.

174
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:07,011
<i>They made me and my friends
do this Harvest ritual.</i>

175
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,582
<i>They said our participation would
bring our family strength, health.</i>

176
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,427
<i>That we'd forever be celebrated
as saviors of the community.</i>

177
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,632
But all they really
wanted was more power.

178
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,373
So, I left before they could get it.

179
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,343
And now they're running out of time
because after the Harvest

180
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,879
comes the Reaping.
And if they don't complete the Harvest,

181
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,447
there won't be a Reaping.

182
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:42,681
Soon, all the witches in the Quarter
will start to lose their power.

183
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,985
Eventually, they'll cease
to be witches altogether.

184
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,560
So what does it take
to complete this ritual?

185
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,194
I have to die.

186
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,889
Hey. What the hell?

187
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,149
You're going out
there anyway, aren't you?

188
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:21,984
I wanna go with you.

189
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,492
No thanks. Already got assaulted
by Klaus this morning.

190
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,652
Don't need a repeat.

191
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,765
What if whatever is responsible
for all those dead witches

192
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:29,992
is still out there?

193
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,534
We've already established that
it likes me and hates witches.

194
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,935
So you'll be safer with me.

195
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,031
Sorry if I'm not buying your
sudden concern for my safety.

196
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,033
(DOOR SLAMS)

197
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,539
Listen. The whole reason I came to
this stupid town in the first place

198
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,443
was to learn more about my family.

199
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,107
Your sister is the one that told me
Marcel ran the werewolves

200
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,344
out of the Quarter into the bayou.
And last night,

201
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,251
pretty sure that some
guardian angel wolf saved my life.

202
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,618
So I'm coming with you.

203
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,124
Could you two be more idiotic?

204
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,126
Two can play the follow game,
you know?

205
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,699
You heard Klaus. He and Marcel are
heading right where you're going.

206
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,636
So distract them. Because
unless you wanna lock a hormonal,

207
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,741
pregnant werewolf in a tomb,
I'm coming with you.

208
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,275
And wouldn't Elijah be mad
if he hears that the baby and I

209
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,242
died of asphyxiation?

210
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,116
What's the matter, Rebekah?
You cross that I'm out with your ex?

211
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,882
What is all that dreadful
hillbilly ruckus in the background?

212
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,492
According to the dreadful signage,
it's Big Auggie's Bayou Bar.

213
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,492
Well, order up a few rounds
of moonshine

214
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,824
and stay clear of the
dead witches for a few.

215
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,332
The witch is on a burial mission,
your baby mama is on a spirit quest,

216
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,629
<i>and I'm keeping Elijah's
promise to keep her safe.</i>

217
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,669
So stall, please.

218
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,144
Everything Okay?

219
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,811
Just the usual.

220
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,513
Temperamental sister.

221
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,525
So, where's your informant?

222
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,526
Tomas?
He's out sniffing around.

223
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,129
Grab a drink,
then we'll chase him down.

224
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,866
Well, I suppose it will give us
a chance to talk things over,

225
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,436
like why you haven't returned Elijah.

226
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:17,336
Maybe your young witch
has grown partial to his company.

227
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,478
She must get so bored.

228
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,376
You never stop, do you?

229
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,380
You never answer, do you?

230
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,041
Why are you so curious about Davina?

231
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,950
If I had a 16-year-old all-powerful
witch at my beck and call,

232
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,988
you would wonder about her too.

233
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,960
You're never gonna get her.

234
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,858
Okay.

235
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,561
I'll ask the
harmless questions, then.

236
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,031
How did you meet her?

237
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,128
(CHUCKLES)

238
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,864
That might surprise you.

239
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,342
This was eight months ago, before
I banned the witches from using magic.

240
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,044
Relations between vampires and witches

241
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,649
weren't what you'd call friendly,
by any means.

242
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:04,880
But let's just say,
we were a little less divided.

243
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,422
In fact, some of us were
getting along just fine.

244
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,765
It's so screwed up.

245
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:29,106
I'm dealing with whacked out,
militant witches.

246
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,248
Hey, you witches all
got a little crazy in you.

247
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,715
And my sister's really
gone off the deep end this time.

248
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,115
Yeah. Jane-Anne has got
martyr written all over her.

249
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,346
That's for sure.

250
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:42,084
They've got every 16-year-old girl
in our coven dying to be one of the four

251
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,353
chosen for this crazy-ass ritual.

252
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,055
Anything I can do to help?

253
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,600
No. You've caused enough
trouble with them.

254
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,258
What, little, old me?

255
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,230
You're a dick.

256
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,396
You always stir it
up with the witches,

257
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,805
which is why this...

258
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,475
. . stays between us.

259
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,808
KLAUS: <i>You and Sophie.</i>

260
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,819
You hypocrite.

261
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,417
You torture those witches,
and yet there you are,

262
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,152
getting positively Romeo and Juliet
with Sophie Deveraux.

263
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,921
It wasn't like that.

264
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,828
It was a mutually satisfying hookup.

265
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,803
So, if Sophie didn't turn to you,
her secret vampire lover,

266
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,569
in her hour of need,
what did she do?

267
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,646
She did what any good girl would do.

268
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,473
She went to her priest.

269
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,618
WOMAN: <i>You've never cared
about witch business, Sophie,</i>

270
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,948
and now you have the gall to reveal
our private dealings to an outsider.

271
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,522
You have to find another way.

272
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,987
You think we do this lightly?

273
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,320
The vampire presence in the
Quarter is growing stronger.

274
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,430
We need more power to fight them off.

275
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,326
Harsh times call for harsh measures.

276
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,990
This is a little more
than harsh, Bastianna.

277
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,295
You don't understand
because you don't believe.

278
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,036
You've never believed.

279
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,539
But I believe enough to put
everything on the line for this.

280
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:08,201
And being chosen for the offering,
it's an honor.

281
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,506
It's a myth, Jane-Anne.

282
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,446
What you are planning
to do is not only wrong,

283
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,483
in my city, it's illegal.

284
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,621
In your city full of vampires?

285
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,621
The vampires and the human faction
have an arrangement,

286
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,851
just like we have with you all.

287
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,052
Protect the locals,
protect our homes,

288
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,720
we look the other way.

289
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,560
What you are planning goes too far.

290
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,464
We are simply taking what we need.

291
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,572
Our connection to our
ancestors weakens over time.

292
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,470
You sow, and you reap.
That's the way the Harvest works.

293
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:43,011
I am the only ally you witches
have in this town.

294
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,378
Do you really wanna face
Marcel without me?

295
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,348
Because that is what
you'll be dealing with

296
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,044
if you go through with the Harvest.

297
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,052
Everything okay in here, Uncle Kieran?

298
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,483
We were just finishing, Sean.

299
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:56,891
Right?

300
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,760
I believe I've made myself clear.

301
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,024
We'll take this matter to the elders.

302
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,828
Continue to study, Sean.

303
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,669
Your uncle is an excellent role model.

304
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,436
(SPEAKING SOFTLY IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

305
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,583
MARCEL: <i>The witches
were furious with Kieran.</i>

306
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:23,118
Sophie tells me that the witches
put a hex on his nephew, Sean.

307
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,278
Made it seem like
he was slowly losing his mind,

308
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,017
in order to distract Kieran
while they kept planning for the Harvest.

309
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,956
So they attacked Kieran's nephew.

310
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,462
Yeah.

311
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,726
Kid wasn't the same after that.
Ended up going postal,

312
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,699
killing all his
fellow seminary students,

313
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,069
all of them, and then himself.

314
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,106
I might have read about that.

315
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:51,378
The boy killed a twin,
or he was a twin or something.

Oh, no, no.
They said that he had a twin sister.

317
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,655
So, enlighten me.

318
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,990
What did you mean
when you said you had to die?

319
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,759
That's what the Harvest was.

320
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,995
They said they'd put us
four girls in a state of, like,

321
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,229
peaceful limbo as part
of the offering,

322
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,931
and then later at the Reaping,
we'd awaken and be reborn.

323
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,635
I never got as far as the limbo part,

324
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,905
which means the Harvest
isn't complete.

325
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,779
That's why the witches
are so freaked out.

326
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,647
The Reaping is just around the corner,

327
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,243
and if they don't finish it before then,
it's over.

328
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,684
All I have to do is wait it out.

329
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,189
And then what?

330
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,521
They're punished, and I'm free.

And is that what you want,
to be normal?

336

against the Harvest

348

00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,787
Skating on the razor's edge.

476
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,060
I'm gonna use the loo.

477
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,034
Back in a tick.

478
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,233
I haven't seen him this
lushy since the twenties.

479
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,071
So you came to take him home?

480
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,475
Why else would I be here?

481
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,809
I don't know.

482
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,509
Maybe to make sure I didn't get too drunk
and spill secrets

483
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,555
better left unspilled
about you and me.

484
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,817
I know better.

485
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,926
I hope so.

486
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,928
Because you don't wanna
to end up on the wrong side of me.

487
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:15,732
Rebekah Mikaelson, you do not
wanna be on the wrong side of me.

488
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,839
Tomas, I presume.

489
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,614
Marcel asked me to find out what
you know about the dead witches.

490
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,949
I heard they were going
after some pregnant werewolf.

491
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,284
I mean, she was stupid
being out there all alone.

492
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,120
Yeah. She was. Yeah. She is.

493
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,228
It's amazing how gullible
some people can be.

494
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,863
Yeah.

495
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,707
You may return this now
to its rightful owner.

496
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,367
It's restored.

(VIOLIN PLAYS SOFTLY)

I don't even know if I'll see him again.

(DEEP RUMBLING)

500
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:26,071
Davina, this power that you contain
drawn from your fallen friends,

501
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,938
it's too much for you.

502
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,570
You need control which
requires study and practice.

503
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,950
And my mother was
a very powerful witch.

504
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,318
She left behind her <i>grimoires,</i>
a legacy of books filled with spells.

505
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,756
These books contain all of the tools
that you might need

506
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,485
to control your magic.

507
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,765
If you free me from here,
I can share them with you.

508
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:55,330
However, if you leave now
with Marcel,

509
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,974
we'll never see each other again,

510
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,305
and I cannot find you,
and I can't help you.

511
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,616
The witches manipulated me.

512
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,013
You know how that ended.

513
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,643
This is not manipulation.

514
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,150
This is one thing
in exchange for another.

515
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,328
I'm offering you a deal.

516
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,230
That was fast work, Rebekah.

517
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,071
Where's Marcel?
In there touching up his lipstick?

518
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,576
Credit me with some taste.

519
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,476
It's filthy in there.

520
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,139
Where'd he go?

521
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,741
He didn't tell you he was leaving?

522
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,852
No.

523
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,857
Do you think he
realized we were stalling him?

524
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,253
No.

525
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:55,357
Unless he was stalling us.

526
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,091
Okay.
Now's our shot.

527

You ready to blow this joint?

528
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:03,838
- Can't wait.
- All right.

529
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,735
We'll leave Elijah
behind as a parting gift.

530
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,177
Might buy me a little forgiveness
for pulling one over on his siblings.

531
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,115
Let's go.

532
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,864

Marcel, there's something
dangerous out there.

00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,447
Take me back.

540
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,925
Damn it.

541
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,809
No one's gonna look for you here.

542
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,374
It's only for a little while
'til I can get you out of town

543
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,675
and someplace safe.

544
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,654
For now, I can get
you whatever you want.

545
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:58,811
What do you like to do?

546
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,447
Draw.

547
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,560
An artist, huh?
That's cool.

548
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,888
Okay-

549
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,724
I can buy out Vincent's
for you tomorrow,

550
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,456
maybe get you some curtains or--

551
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,225
Marcel.

552
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:15,337
You know what I really want?

553
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,075
I wanna make them pay.

554
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,086
Elijah?

555
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,591
I'm pleased you stayed.

556
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,762
You'll keep your promise
about your mother's spell book?

557
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,194
I will.

558
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:49,334
You know, difficulties aside,
I value my family above everything.

559
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,569
I am sorry that yours failed you.

560
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,706
Your brother Klaus handed
you to Marcel in a box,

561
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,405
yet you still don't give up on him.

562
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:02,411
Well, I've given up on giving up.

563
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,215
It's an affliction.

564
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,888
I will fight for my family
until my last breath.

565
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,194
And I'll fight the witches until mine.

566
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,563
Now what?

567
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,070
You're just gonna leave her
up there for anybody to find?

568
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,765
I'm not in the mood, Kieran.

569
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,605
You were supposed to get her out
of New Orleans after the Harvest.

570
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,203
We failed those other three girls.
We didn't fail her.

571
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,975
That is why I came to you for help.
That was the plan.

572
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,482
Plans change.

573
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,314
Especially after you found
out how powerful she was.

574
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,651
Let's get something straight.

575
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,987
For eight months since you left,
I've been running this town just fine.

576
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,596
I don't need you coming back
and getting in my business.

577
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,732
I will do what I want where I want.

578
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:50,923
Got it?

579
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,129
You wanna be the boss?

580
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,168
You wanna call the shots?

581
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:59,139
Fine, but I call the shots
with the humans.

582
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,007
And you don't wanna
make an enemy of me.

583
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:12,512
So, I would suggest one thing,
stay away from my niece.

584
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,092
Fine.
Who the hell's your niece?

585
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:17,922
Cami.

586
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:40,042
Those people, all this because
of a vision about my baby

587
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:42,207
you don't think is true.

588
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:46,015
Look, I love Sabine,

589
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,521
but she's the witch equivalent
of a drama queen.

590
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,857
I've learned to take little stock
in whatever she says or sees.

591
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,396
Just kind of wish
she'd kept her mouth shut.

592
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,863
The Harvest ritual.

593
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,900
You said you didn't believe in it.

594
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,804
Were you right?

595
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,805
No.

596
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:08,310
I saw it with my own eyes.
It was working.

597
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,741
It was real.

598
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:17,078
So how can you be so sure
Sabine's vision isn't?

599
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,594
KLAUS: Taking me on a field trip
to distract me?

600
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,603
Pathetic and obvious.
I taught you better than that.

601
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,265
You taught me to protect what's mine.

602
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:43,413
You will not take Davina from me.
End of story.

603
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,206
An immutable law of nature, Marcel,

604
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,350
is the strong always
take from the weak.

605
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,281
If you were so strong, you wouldn't
have run away from New Orleans

606
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:53,616
like a little bitch
all those years ago.

607
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,950
(GRUNTING)

608
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,624
You've been playing king with
a bunch of children for too long.

609
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,958
Don't mistake me for one of your
Nightwalker lackies, Marcel.

610
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,294
I can take Davina any time I like.

611
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,934
What the...?

612
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,134
Do forgive me, Marcel.

613
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:19,078
But if anyone is to teach
my brother a lesson, it's me.

614
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,920
I don't care if we
have to get you a leash.

615
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,889
That was your last trip to the bayou.

616
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,393
What is it with you and
those wolves, anyway?

617
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,122
I feel like we're connected somehow.

618
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,435
I don't know.

619
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:43,505
Maybe it's just some pipe dream
that I have of finding any real family

620
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:48,269
out there, but sometimes when
I feel like it's me against the world,

621
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,071
keeps me going.

622
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,941
Oh, right.

623
00:37:56,141 --> 00:38:00,112
Well, if you ask me,
family is a pain in the behind.

624
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:04,284
And as for being in it alone,
how dare you?

625
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,789
I don't ruin a perfectly
fabulous pair of boots

626
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,989
traipsing through the Bayou
for just anyone.

627
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,040
Nik. Finally. What...?

628
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,643
Elijah.

629
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,022
You're safe.

630
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:42,562
Now that you're home,
is your first plan to kill Niklaus?

631
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,496
Excuse me, just a moment.

632
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:51,973
Where's he going?

633
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,030
You're back.

634
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,897
I'm back.

635
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,113
Don't make promises you can't keep.

636
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,251
Welcome home.

637
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,021
ELIJAH: Everything that brought
us here to New Orleans was a lie.

638
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,759
This story that
Sophie Deveraux fabricated,

639
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,766
this struggle for
control of the French Quarter,

640
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,962
this war between
vampires and witches,

641
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,971
wasn't over territory at all.
This was over Davina.

642
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,636
I swear I had no idea that the
Harvest could possibly be real.

643
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:07,146
But the one thing that you were sure of
is that I was wrong and that

644
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:12,152
I would risk Monique's life on a
maybe, and now my daughter is dead.

645
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,053
Please tell me how to fix this.

646
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:21,556
Now that Marcel has Davina,
how are we even supposed to find her?

647
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,289
If we don't finish the Harvest,

648
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:27,129
Monique and those two other girls
are dead for real.

649
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,172
Look at me.

650
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:36,835
You and I are gonna find
a way to get Monique back.

651
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,013
It'll be our little secret.

652
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,343
We'll do it together.

653
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,613
We'll seal off the cemetery
from the vampires,

654
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,849
find Davina, stop Marcel, and finish
the ritual once and for all.

655
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:53,191
Even if I have to slit
Davina's throat myself.

656
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:02,770
Eight months ago, Sophie Deveraux and
her sister Jane-Anne lost everything.

657
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,441
Now, four months after that,
a young, pregnant girl

658
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,042
wanders into their restaurant.

659
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,372
Suddenly, all hope is renewed.

660
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:13,209
Jane-Anne actually sacrificed
her life so that her sister

661
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:15,874
could use you to find Davina.

662
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,953
If Sophie Deveraux is
successful in capturing Davina,

663
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:22,183
she can return
Jane-Anne's daughter back to life.

664
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,886
We thought we'd come here
to wage a war for power.

665
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,495
This is about family.

666
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,656
In order to return her niece to life,

667
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,734
Sophie Deveraux will fight
to the death.

668
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,798
That makes her more
dangerous than anyone.

669
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:44,043
