1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:01,501
Previously on Condor...

2
00:00:01,642 --> 00:00:04,048
He changed his mind, wants to help.
- Help how?

3
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:06,859
He's going over the files.
He thinks Gordon's been set up.

4
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:09,766
I have an asset inside the SVR

5
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:11,336
A week ago he passed me a file

6
00:00:11,383 --> 00:00:14,509
indicating that Gordon Piper was
working with the Russians.

7
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:17,508
I can't do this anymore.

8
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:22,000
When you contact the CIA, you
must not say that I helped you.

9
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:25,459
I need to ask you for
one last favour.

10
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:29,059
I'm suggesting that the mole's
treachery is getting people killed...

11
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:31,570
...and causing other damage in
ways we cannot begin to know.

12
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:34,001
So as much as we may dislike
each other personally...

13
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:36,001
I don't have a personal
opinion about you.

14
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,604
So as much as I dislike
you personally,

15
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:41,338
I showed you my report
in a spirit of openness

16
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,490
This is the same photo from Bob's office.

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,810
And you can plant fake files but how do
you make an innocent man take a payoff?

18
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:49,806
Gordon took money from a
Russian intelligent agent.

19
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:52,134
No more waiting
- I agree

20
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,719
Can you do me a favour?

21
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,584
The pizza's here.

22
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:58,077
I asked them to let me be
the one to come and get you.

23
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,559
Tracy, I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

24
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:02,083
Lior Lishkott.
You took money from him.

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,297
You are going to have
to go away for a while.

26
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:07,564
How long do I
have to go away for?

27
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:13,134
The ambulance ...!
- What ambulance?

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,839
How'd they get it?

29
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,459
Where'd you get the ambulance?
- Rented it.

30
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:21,373
Your friend...the one who's alive
Is he going to tell anyone my name?

31
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,106
He doesn't know your name.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,074

33
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,918
Hi. There's been a development
I thought you'd want to know about.

34
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,375
Gordon's been picked up.
- Okay

35
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,918
I'll come in with you.
- I'm out front.

36
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:49,629
I feel terrible for what I've done.

37
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,059
You didn't do anything to him.
You defended him.

38
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,810
That's what I keep telling myself.

39
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,262
This is on Gordon. Your not responsible

40
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:01,776
I keep telling myself that, too.
And it was his decision so

41
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:04,834
But I didn't try and help him.
I saw him getting worse.

42
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:09,918
The drinking and the money problems
and the fights with Eva...

43
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:14,316
He was hurting. I didn't reach out. 
I did the opposite.

44
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:18,974
You should have seen the way Eva looked
at me when I walked him out of the house

45
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:23,709
Like she wanted to kill me.
His kids...

46
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:29,918
If Gordon is innocent, we 
will have a chance to prove it.

47
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:34,584
Did he say anything? 
- No. He's really isolated.

48
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,292
Robin's gonna let him sit overnight
and question him in the morning.

49
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:42,209
I still believe that
Gordon was set up.

50
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:49,209
I don't know what
I believe any more.

51
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,147
Anything on the ambulance?

52
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,998
They were still setting up
a spreadsheet when I left.

53
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,125
Okay. 'Til the morning...

54
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,501
I've missed you, my friend.
I wish the circumstances were better.

55
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,675
At least it looks as though
your people have taken the bait.

56
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,355
They're not my people.

57
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,078
There may still be a problem.
- Who?  - Joe Turner.

58
00:04:56,765 --> 00:04:59,187
He recognised the photo from
the file I planted in Partidge's office.

59
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,109
He is smart.
- I'll handle it.

60
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,750
No, if anything happened to
Turner it'll only bring more heat.

61
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,980
I'm keeping him close.
He trusts me.

62
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,187
If it needs to be done, I'll do it.

63
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:14,359
There's another loose end to tie.
The guy we used for the Sirin job, Dan Letts...

64
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:16,174
I don't think he
could ID me but...

65
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,042
...why take the chance?

66
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,357
Any word from Moscow on
how Sirin found out about me?

67
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:26,450
We're investigating.
You're going to have to stay here.

68
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:29,451
You've earned your retirement:
nice apartment in Moscow...

69
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:32,351
dacha in the country,
money, whatever you want

70
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:38,342
The timing's not good.
I've met someone.

71
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:43,637
I'm thinking about getting out.
- Getting out?

72
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,250
You could be seen as a liability.
- Is that a threat?

73
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,834
Not by me.

74
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,429
You think I'm gonna become a triple agent?
- The risk...

75
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:00,026
I don't have any reason
to say anything to anybody...

76
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,560
...and every reason not to.

77
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:04,670
When we first met, you were 
a man with thwarted ambitions...

78
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,709
...and a burning desire
to do something great.

79
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:10,459
That never goes away,
even if it goes dormant for a while.

80
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm not that man anymore. 
I want a simple life now.

81
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,159
Moscow may not allow it.

82
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,690
Why does Moscow care where I retire?

83
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,412
If you were in Moscow,
you could let the world know...

84
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:29,268
...the extent of our
penetration into the CIA.

85
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,347
That in itself is a
public relations coup.

86
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:35,101
This isn't about Moscow. This is 
about you, and you want the credit.

87
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,709
I want us to get the credit.

88
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:40,795
All that work... all those years...

89
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:42,315
What were they for?

90
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:25,501
Does he look okay?
What the fuck happened?

91
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,918
Where the fuck are you?
I call and I call. Call me back!

92
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:48,918
I'm really fucking scared. I think
someone's watching me.

93
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,292
Damn...

94
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,375
Would you like some dessert?

95
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:20,792
If you have any heart medication,
now would be the time to take it.

96
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,501
Do you have to get that?

97
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:38,828
It's just my assistant. 
She's checking up on me.

98
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:41,039
I'll call her in the morning.

99
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:49,046
So would you like to
see the rest of the house?

100
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:53,049
I don't believe you've
been upstairs yet.

101
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,667
I'd like that very much.

102
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,209
Does that feel good?
- Oh, yeah...

103
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:36,375
Are you expecting someone?
- No.

104
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:47,658
Hi, Carla. 
- Sorry to show up unannounced.

105
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:48,998
I tried calling a few times

106
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,025
What's wrong?

107
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,349
I got a call from a 
contact over at the FBI.

108
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:56,408
Their embedded at CIMC has
taken one of our people into custody.

109
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,433
Who?

110
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,862
Gordon Piper.

111
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,751
Oh, fucking hilarious!

112
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:42,598
You think this is funny?
This shit could kill me!

113
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,751
Fucking assholes!

114
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,375
Come in!

115
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,834
Watching anything good?

116
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:22,459
Good morning.
- I thought you'd be happier to see me.

117
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,498
You've just taken one
of my people into custody.

118
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:28,263
A mole operating right
under my nose for years.

119
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:31,380
What good is winning
if you don't get to gloat?

120
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:52,417
Don't hurt me, I come in peace.

121
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,972
I'm taking Jude to school.
Do you need a lift?

122
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:58,252
No, I'll ride my bike.
- Okay

123
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,918
Why are you all dressed up?

124
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,584
I have an important meeting today. 
- With who?

125
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,807
I'm going to talk to
someone about Reuel Abbott.

126
00:12:10,851 --> 00:12:12,952
I've been thinking
about what you said...

127
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:14,293
...and if there's a way
to hold him accountable...

128
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:15,571
...for what he's
done to this family...

129
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,103
...I'm with you to get it done.

130
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:20,592
Good. - I want you to promise me
that you're going to stay away from him.

131
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:23,504
He's a a evil prick and I don't
know what he's capable of.

132
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,042
Say it.
- I promise.

133
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,130
Okay.

134
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,334
Oh. I'll get my camera...

135
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,209
You look nice when you want to.
- I'm having lunch with a friend.

136
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:47,250
I'm gonna go get ready for school.
See you.

137
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:52,561
Though maybe you'd stayed
over at your lady friend's again.

138
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:54,894
Oh, no, it was more 
of a one-night thing.

139
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,751
Well, you have a way of making
temporary things permanent.

140
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,501
See you later.
- See you.

141
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:10,339
I'm waiting to hear back from them.

142
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,351
We'll see you at the club. 
- I'm on my way.

143
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,626
It's all about who you know...

144
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:22,292
You sprung for the premium package, huh?

145
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,149
It isn't like Tinder.

146
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:51,018
You need references from two members
and there's this whole approval process.

147
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:54,834
Jesus! - Yeah, Jesus couldn't even 
get on this dating app, bro.

148
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,542
-Good morning.
-Hey man.

149
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,045
This is an FBI matter now.
We're shutting down the site.

150
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:02,852
Yeah, I know. I'm just wondering
how you got on with that ambulance.

151
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,763
Ambulance? - Yeah, we put together
a database of rental companies...

152
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:08,546
...but that's about it.
- Can I get a copy?

153
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:09,768
Well, the hard drives 
are packed away...

154
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,659
You know we already 
got the guy, right?

155
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:15,112
I know.
But it's important.

156
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,167
I can find it for you.
- All right.

157
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,792
Good morning.
- Hey.

158
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:34,162
Measuring your mark?
- I've got this one all sized up.

159
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:37,834
He's not much different than anyone
else with a penis. Just a bit more extreme.

160
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:43,751
Really? - Deep down every man believes 
in his own unique specialness.

161
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,893
I think it's a flaw in your gender.
- Thinking we're special?

162
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:51,125
Thinking that your specialness has
gone unrecognised by everyone else.

163
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:55,375
That's why someone turns traitor.
To win back that specialness.

164
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,851
If a spy is someone
who keeps secrets...

165
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,268
...a mole is someone who
keeps secrets from other spies.

166
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,751
What could be more special that that?

167
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,496
I'm going to break him.

168
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,940
I'm going to give him no choice...

169
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:11,057
...but to defend himself with a
declaration of his own importance.

170
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,584
He already looks pretty broken.
What are you waiting for?

171
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:19,751
Reuel Abbott's in the building.
He had to step away for a few minutes.

172
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:23,292
I guess nothing stays a secret for long.
- It's okay.

173
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,501
That way we get to kill
two birds with one stone.

174
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,626
The other bird being?
- Him learning to fear me.

175
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:33,381
How are you doing?
- I feel a crippling guilt.

176
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:34,852
But other than that, great.

177
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:37,667
This isn't anybody's
fault but Gordon's.

178
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,417
I know.

179
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,834
Thanks very much.

180
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:06,667
Anyone good in this movie of yours?
- You know my nephew Sammy?

181
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:08,357
So it's a student film?

182
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:11,935
The kid is amazing. He edits
all the effects on his laptop.

183
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,701
Kids these days...

184
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:19,018
I just saw in a newspaper that a 12-year-old
girl just got into Harvard Medical School.

185
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,000
Here she is.

186
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:26,334
No, this is not what I'm looking for.
-  It's an ambulance.

187
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:31,209
No, the kid's got a real specific vision.

188
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,180
I myself am in between cars.

189
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,852
I don't suppose you've
got something I could rent?

190
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:39,250
Sure, we can scrounge 
you up a car.

191
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,453
Sorry for the hold up.
Did I miss anything good?.

192
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,227
No, she's waited for you.

193
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,422
Wants to give me a taste of my own fate, huh?

194
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:54,417
That's at the heart of any 
good drama, don't you think?

195
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:59,081
Getting to imagine yourself
standing in somebody else's shoes...

196
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:02,542
It's... I look forward to it, really

197
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:05,650
-You have a lighter attitude
about this than I expected.

198
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,313
I do, don't I?
I feel lighter.

199
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:12,584
Robin?

200
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:16,459
This has all been a
giant misunderstanding.

201
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,450
Lior Lishkott and I are
going into business together.

202
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:19,481
It's all above board.

203
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:21,904
I just couldn't report it up the
ladder until I was sure it was real.

204
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:23,504
You understand that?

205
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,422
The money was just an
advance against my salary.

206
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,507
We were going to lose the house.

207
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:38,575
Are you going to pull this
intimidation bullshit with me?

208
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:40,422
Show me a little dignity

209
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:46,501
How dignified is it to take money from a man
with direct ties to Russian intelligence, Gordon?

210
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,943
Bullshit

211
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,501
It's all in there. Lior's business
is financed by the Kremlin.

212
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:57,042
He's an SVR asset.

213
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:13,250
I didn't know.

214
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,501
Right. You're just a spy.

215
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:21,584
It's not like it's your
business to know such things.

216
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:25,375
How many blown ops have
you been a part of recently?

217
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:29,542
Belgrade, Dubrovnik... the 
Ukrainian op last week.

218
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:35,351
How much loss of life and spilled
blood are we talking about here?

219
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,109
You know me.

220
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,921
I think we are well beyond 
that assumption, Gordo.

221
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:44,834
I know how bad it looks, but 
what's the logical explanation?

222
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,766
That I suddenly turned against my country
after more than a decade of loyal service...

223
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:51,953
...or that I did
something fucking stupid?

224
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,542
Those aren't mutually
exclusive possibilities.

225
00:18:55,834 --> 00:19:00,667
If I was to believe that
you were just stupid...

226
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,417
...you'd have to be
pretty fucking stupid!

227
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:08,042
I swear. I am loyal.

228
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,792
More than a decade, huh?
- Yes

229
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,303
What year did you
join the Agency?

230
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:23,310
Come on, you know 
the answer to that.

231
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:28,818
You don't like my answers, so why 
don't we start hearing yours?

232
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:33,542
2005.

233
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:35,982
Why did you join?
- Robin...

234
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:40,511
I'm trying to figure out where it
all  went wrong for you, Gordon.

235
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:44,375
Why did you join the CIA?

236
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:48,042
Go back to being a kid who
didn't know what their future was...

237
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:52,751
...and who never could have imagined
where life was going to take him.

238
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:58,542
Jay Atwood? - Are
you the new waiter?

239
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:00,417
No, I ... -
- I was kidding.

240
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,862
I can tell you're not the new waiter.
You're clearly American.

241
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:04,471
Who are you?
Why do I care?

242
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:06,453
Your secretary said
you'd be down here.

243
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:08,235
Said you don't spend
much time in the office.

244
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,435
This is my office and I've got a 
twelve o'clock meeting, so...

245
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:12,942
I'm your twelve o'clock.

246
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:17,169
Your office... your other office
said you'd be expecting me.

247
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:18,312
Tracy Crane...

248
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:25,371
You're Tracy Crane...
Ah shit!

249
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,428
You were expecting a woman?

250
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:33,537
Yeah, I was expecting a....
Got dressed up, showered and everything.

251
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:37,308
Welcome to Athens.
Jay Attwood.

252
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:38,823
You hungry? 
You want some lunch?

253
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:41,963
Sure.
- Bring him the special...

254
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,125
Sit down.

255
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:51,501
The food here is excellent, but
Athens station is pure loukaniko party.

256
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:53,454
You know what a loukaniko is?
- No.

257
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,851
Loukaniko is sausage. What I'm
saying is that Athens is a sausage party.

258
00:20:56,876 --> 00:21:01,008
I thought we were getting some new talent.
- Sorry to disappoint.

259
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:04,584
So, is this your first posting?
- Yeah.

260
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:08,057
Well, Athens is a good place 
to pop your cherry.

261
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:10,939
Maybe you'd rather pop her cherry?
Huh?

262
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:13,405
I'm married. 
We have a three year old.

263
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:15,626
And the guy's got an
answer for everything...

264
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:25,834
So? Why'd you join
the you know what?

265
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,334
I'm talking about the CIA.

266
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:32,415
To serve my country. 
Something that's intellectually stimu...

267
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:35,179
No, no, no. No, stop.
Don't give me the bullshit answer.

268
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:37,709
You already got the job. 
 - I was...I'm not...

269
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:41,998
Come on. When you were six 
years old, what did you want to be?

270
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,216
Fireman?
- Astronaut.

271
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:47,608
Yeah? So what are you still
doing down here on earth?

272
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:58,542
I think I internalised at a
young age that I was special.

273
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:01,918
That I had the potential to do 
something important in the world.

274
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:06,167
And I've never really
let go of that idea.

275
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,709
One too many attaboys, huh?

276
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:18,876
All right. All right.
Now we're getting someplace.

277
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,834
Thank you for seeing me,
Senator Trask.

278
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,876
Reuel Abbott is a very powerful
man. I understand your concern.

279
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:33,589
I don't imagine there are many
people who have seen his dark side...

280
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:35,351
...and are willing to talk about it.

281
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,042
Reuel has been operating
out of bounds for far too long.

282
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:41,045
The American people deserve
to know the truth about anyone

283
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:42,693
we entrust with the
exercise of power

284
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:46,216
I want to show you I will do
everything within my power

285
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:49,167
to protect you from
the possibility of retribution.

286
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:55,542
But if it's too much for you, if you
need more time, are having doubts

287
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,334
I don't want to pressure you into
saying something you're not ready to say.

288
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:03,292
No ... I'm ready.

289
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:07,334
Well?

290
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:12,209
I have been to every lot between here and
Baltimore looking for this exact ambulance.

291
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,709
It was just used in
a bank heist movie.

292
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,156
Oh yeah? What was the name of the film?
- I don't remember.

293
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:19,333
You don't remember the name
of the guy who rented it from you?

294
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,917
I maintain strict confidentiality
with all my customers.

295
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,190
So, what's your film all about?

296
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:28,612
I'm not making a movie.

297
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,501
Neither was the guy
that rented this from you.

298
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:45,792
Movies use blanks. This
was used for something else.

299
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:54,709
If you give me the renter's information,
your part in this ends here.

300
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:10,959
I didn't question Sam's death until 
Iris came along.  - Iris Loramer?

301
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,292
She told me that Sam was
involved in the death of her husband

302
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,974
and she had proof.
She'd filmed them together.

303
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:25,417
I saw it. My husband who I thought I knew
ordering the death of one of her friends.

304
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,258
I know that you've seen it.
Now I'd like you to unsee it.

305
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:33,518
Go get it for me.
Put it in my hand.

306
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:36,876
Once you accused me
of threatening your family.

307
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:40,918
At that time it was the
furthest thing from my mind.

308
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:45,459
So you gave it to him - the media card?
- What else could I do?

309
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:48,083
They can kill you and
make it look like an accident.

310
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:56,209
I know that I shouldn't have given
it to him. I was just so scared.

311
00:25:56,375 --> 00:26:00,751
You did the right thing at the time ...
and you're doing the right thing now.

312
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:11,250
It's Tracy. 
Leave a message.

313
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:15,714
It's me. I've found the ambulance. I've got
the guy's address and I'm on my way there.

314
00:26:15,714 --> 00:26:16,714
Call me back

315
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,685
How long have you been married?

316
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,876
I love it here!

317
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:42,017
I found this cute little bazaar,
and then Anders...

318
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,562
What are you doing?

319
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:49,501
I just realized ... that
Anders is asleep

320
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:57,000
You don't want to hear about my day?
 - Yes, I'm very good at multi-tasking.

321
00:26:57,167 --> 00:27:02,501
Tell me ... about that bazaar.

322
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,584
Sorry.

323
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:28,292
Have you noticed that all NFL
quarterbacks could be models?

324
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:30,667
No, but I'm guessing that you've
got a theory on the subject.

325
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:36,209
Great leaders are not born.
They're made.

326
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:39,586
They are bred with years
of confidence-building

327
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:41,643
starting all the way
back at the playground.

328
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,667
How many times have you
heard the sentence growing up...

329
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:48,959
"You're going to be a
heart-breaker, Tracy." Right?

330
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:55,250
That sense of specialness that
you internalised in your youth.

331
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:57,620
That's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

332
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,420
It's the same shit they said to Tom Brady.

333
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,375
An interesting theory.

334
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,334
Okay, I got to take a piss.

335
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,120
Baby, come here.

336
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:31,083
Where we going?

337
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:35,667
I'm leaving Athens. 
- Why?

338
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:41,667
Because you're a fucking shit! 
That came in the mail today.

339
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,876
Baby...
- Fucking asshole.

340
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:03,345
I thought you were married.
- Huh?

341
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,713
They sent us a copy.

342
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:09,042
They send one to your wife?

343
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,918
Fucking Russians, man. 
I am sorry.

344
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,417
Russians? 
- She was a honey pot.

345
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:23,667
I thought you were slick.
I thought you were Tom Brady.

346
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,250
Did she leave you?

347
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,212
Went back to Virginia.

348
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:31,899
Well, you won't be too far behind
her so maybe you'll want her back.

349
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:33,415
What?

350
00:29:33,415 --> 00:29:35,477
Your flight
leaves at 8am tomorrow.

351
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:38,314
Pack what you need. I'll have
the rest shipped over to you.

352
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:38,976
I don't understand.

353
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,945
C'mon man. You're a smart guy.
We're taking you off the field.

354
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:53,334
You've had a pretty
mediocre career.

355
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:59,309
Things didn't go exactly as planned, 
but that doesn't make me traitor.

356
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:01,912
But taking money from
a Russian asset does.

357
00:30:01,912 --> 00:30:02,802
Lior played me.

358
00:30:02,827 --> 00:30:05,667
No, I bet my career 
that you're dirty.

359
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:10,667
I thought he was just ex-Mossad
and no shit about Russia. He said...

360
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:15,708
...he said I was the business
partner he was looking for

361
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,512
He stroked my ego.
I fell for it.

362
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,417
I needed the money.
- We all need the money.

363
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,844
You have to believe me. 
- No.

364
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:30,292
You have to convince me. And
you are not very convincing.

365
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:36,167
Frankly, the only part I'm having a hard time
believing is how anybody can be such a loser.

366
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,250
Fuck you, Robin.

367
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:52,584
You okay?
- Sorry, Gordon is a friend.

368
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:56,083
No apology necessary.

369
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,918
It's never easy to learn that a
friend isn't who you thought they were.

370
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:21,000
Matty?

371
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,876
Matty?

372
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:39,501
Fuck!

373
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,459
Fuck!

374
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:35,000
You were in the car with him. 
- I can explain.

375
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:38,709
The fuck you do?
Why d'you kill Matty?

376
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,183
Because of the Russians?
Because you guys were working together...

377
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:42,797
He's dead!

378
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:45,144
What? 
- We didn't kill him.

379
00:34:45,144 --> 00:34:48,833
We were gonna make...
What? what? You didn't... He's alive?!

380
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,417
We was gonna hand him over, man!
- To who? The Russians?

381
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:55,569
The Russians? We
were working for the CIA.

382
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:56,560
Who at the CIA?

383
00:34:56,584 --> 00:35:00,125
You fucking with my head, man!
- I'm on your side.

384
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,792
And that's not such a good place 
to be 'cos everyone's dead!

385
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:06,334
Calm down. You need to hear me,
okay. I'm unarmed.

386
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:11,250
Do you have any idea how many
unarmed men I've killed? One or two...

387
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:16,102
Don't fucking move! Stay 
on the fucking ground!

388
00:35:16,102 --> 00:35:18,310
I'm a federal agent. My name is Joe Turner

389
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:22,834
Joe Turner? You were in the car with
Sirin when that whole deal went down.

390
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,459
Dale Fridrych, FBI.

391
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:29,433
I got a lead on Letts,
an informant who said...

392
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:32,185
he and his crew were
contracted to kill Sirin.

393
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:35,083
No, not kill - kidnap. 
And he got away.

394
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,453
So, is Sirin alive?
- I think so.

395
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:39,386
Do you know where he is?
- No.

396
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:44,834
You're bleeding. I got a first aid
kit in my truck. Wait here a minute.

397
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,334
What the fuck is going on ...?

398
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:59,125
It's Tracy. Leave a message.

399
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:33,709
I am impressed. Your little speech
brought Mr. Crane to tears.

400
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:36,667
Tracy's too close to the case.

401
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:41,459
He tried to persuade me Gordon was being set up
by the Russians to protect the real infiltrator.

402
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:46,051
Tracy is a good man and good
men like to think the best of others.

403
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:47,818
Not like us.

404
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,959
Leave a message.

405
00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:08,417
Two dead guys. Our guy's skull is cracked
open. Probably a drug deal gone wrong.

406
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:12,959
He's going on about how we can't arrest
him because he works for the government.

407
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,981
Excuse me? 
- Yes.

408
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:17,982
I'm here for Joseph Turner.

409
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,521
Are you a lawyer? 
- No, I'm the deputy director of the CIA.

410
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:37,727
I checked. There is no Dale
Fridrych working for the CIMC.

411
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:39,935
The Russians are cleaning
up after themselves.

412
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:42,287
They set up Gordon to
protect their actual inside man.

413
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,326
This whole fucking thing has
been one big active measure.

414
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:49,125
If this is a disinformation campaign you and
Ms Larkin really stepped into it, didn't you?

415
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:51,876
What are you going to do now?

416
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,751
If Sirin's alive and you can find him,
maybe he can tell you who the mole is.

417
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:03,086
Too bad you didn't pick a place to meet
in the event things didn't go as planned.

418
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,111
Trade craft?

419
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:09,834
I'm not the only one who
made an obvious mistake.

420
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,542
Am I? You were in Bob's office
the night that he died.

421
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:19,751
Why didn't you go through his files?
- Maybe I was overcome by grief.

422
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:23,751
Yeah, or maybe you have reason
to hang Gordon Piper out to dry.

423
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,209
Good night.

424
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:57,709
What can I get you?
Whiskey.

425
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:12,501
It makes sense that a man who
was once burned would fear fire.

426
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:16,250
Do we know each other?
- Of course I know you, Tracy.

427
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:21,918
Sorry, I don't remember you. 
- That's because we've never met.

428
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:25,501
But I've been looking for someone
like you for a very long time.

429
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:29,501
I think you mistake
me for someone else.

430
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,250
No I don't think so.

431
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:39,083
There you go...

432
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:38,667
I need to see you.

433
00:41:43,576 --> 00:41:45,501
Food time!

434
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:54,000
Where's Dad? 
- He's still at work. C'mon, let's eat.

435
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:04,042
You've been crying, huh?

436
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah, I've had a hell of a day, too.

437
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:10,834
Thank you for coming.

438
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:28,709
You and I should go away together.

439
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:31,294
When? 
- Right now.

440
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:35,411
It's crazy... I can't.
- It makes perfect sense to me.

441
00:43:35,436 --> 00:43:37,099
We'll leave as soon
as you're packed.

442
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:42,042
I have children. Someone
has to drive them and feed them...

443
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,928
...and stand over them
when the do their homework.

444
00:43:44,928 --> 00:43:46,591
Ask your mom to look after them.

445
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:51,042
I've a shift tomorrow.
- Get another doctor to cover it.

446
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:57,000
You have an answer for everything, huh?
- No, just us two things.

447
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,675
If we leave right now we
can be there before midnight.

448
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:02,456
Where?
- It's a surprise.

449
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:04,946
Well then how would I know what to pack?

450
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:06,657
Just bring one of everything.

451
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:15,564
Joe? My name is Ekaterina.
My American friends call me Kat.

452
00:45:15,564 --> 00:45:17,364
We have a friend in common.

453
