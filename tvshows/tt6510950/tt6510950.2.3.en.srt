you're suggesting what?

9
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:24,395
I'm suggesting that a mole's treachery
is getting people killed and

I don't know.

What do you know?
What did Sirin tell you?

32
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,472
That he was been hunted.

33
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:13,906
Maybe he said that that to
trigger your empathy. What else?

34
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:20,449
He said he was with the SVR and had
been funneling information to my uncle.

35
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:22,720
And there was a senior
CIA officer doing the

36
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,849
exactly the same thing
for the Russians.

37
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,617
- Did he give you a name?
- No.

38
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:30,086
He give no indication
of who the mole might be?

39
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,391
Nope.

40
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:36,909
So, why were you watching Piper?

41
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:40,493
There was a file on Gordon hidden
in Bob Partridge's home office

42
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,534
- What kind of file?
- History on the agency...

43
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,785
financial stuff, surveillance photos,
that sort of things...

44
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:51,243
- Where is it now?
- I was jumped and someone took it.

45
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,325
Who jumped you?

46
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:54,769
My first thought was
one of your people.

47
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:56,387
My people don't operate that way.

48
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:58,995
Maybe you don't know you
people as well as you think

49
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,161
- Could've been the Russians.
- Or the mole.

50
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:05,161
- Which will answer our question.
- Which was?

51
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,893
At the funeral Gordon
took an interest in you.

52
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:11,186
We took an interest in each other.

53
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:13,304
But, if was Gordon who jumped
you, that

54
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:15,603
would mean he knew
that you saw the file.

55
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:18,579
He'd want keep you close,
see what you did next.

56
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:23,996
I'm not doing anything next.
I've told you everything that I know.

57
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:26,412
Did Gordon suggest another meeting?

58
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,210
He invited me to brunch, at the church.
But I...

59
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:33,295
Take him up on that.

60
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,782
I told you, I'm done.

61
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:38,906
You didn't look done when we
found you outside Piper's house?

62
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:43,476
My curiosity got the better of
me, but obviously

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,141
I can just leave it
to the professionals.

Well, the professionals
are asking for your help.

possible need me to do?

system, we'll give you

through, if she found

82
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:10,799
out I had a good friend of
ours under surveillance.

83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,566
I don't think it would
go over very well.

84
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,458
I mean I invited her to a party at the
guy's house, for Christ's sakes.

He is your friend.
Why don't you go and spray the keypad?

Work's been crazy.

158
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,864
No problem

159
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:17,456
Hey, Turner! My new pal.
Do you know Joe?

160
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:19,708
- Hello, Pastor, thank you so much.
- Good to see you. It was my pleasure.

161
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:23,514
See you soon. Question for you big
man, I've all these pancakes.

162
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:26,314
I don't know what to do.
Can you help me out?

163
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:29,677
Do you like pancakes, what do you say?
You guys in?

164
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:32,482
- You want to get some pancakes? Yes.
- Alright.

165
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:35,541
- We have been invited to brunch.
- Great.

166
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,666
Are you trying to get inside my head?

167
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:44,125
Excuse me?

168
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:48,191
You people distort reality,
play games with the mind!

169
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:50,691
But you ain't getting inside my head.

170
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,188
Is everything okay?

171
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:55,983
This guy is CIA,
I ain't taking shit from him.

172
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:59,835
I've been watching him real close and he
didn't put anything in the soup, Jerry.

173
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:04,793
Besides, we don't want you to
go hungry? Here you go.

174
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,377
OK.

175
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:16,544
They can be a little off balance,
the key is not to take it to heart.

176
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:18,668
Thank you for the advice.

177
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:22,336
- I'm Holly.
- Reuel Abbott.

178
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,879
- I haven't seen you around before.
- It is my first time.

179
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:28,795
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

180
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:34,086
I didn't put anything in the soup. I
know. I've been watching you real close.

181
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:38,128
- Why?
- Because you're cute.

182
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:46,254
- Hey! Romeo!
- Oh! I'm sorry.

183
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,507
You really enjoy making me miserable?
Want another drink?

184
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:02,679
Sorry, what?

185
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:06,240
Do you want another drink,
what's going on there spaceguy?

186
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:09,341
You are such a bad influence,
leave him!

187
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,402
Can we watch a movie, can we mom?

188
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:14,907
- It's okay with me.
- Yeah, sure, just nothing too scary.

189
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:19,150
Excuse me,
I'm just gonna go check on Sammy.

190
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:22,774
I would worry about him, he probably
just, you know, smoking weed.

191
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:26,509
- Hilarious, Gordon.
- He laughed at it.

192
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,800
- Wasn't funny.
- Funny thing is I'm not joking.

193
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:32,164
(PHONE BUZZING)

194
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,737
- Hey.
- Hey.

195
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,197
Sorry, I was gonna call
Sammy but I didn't want him

196
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,826
to think I was checking up on him.
He's there right?

197
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:48,468
Yes, he and Anders are
playing Rainbow Six Siege.

198
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:52,009
That sounds like a Navy SEAL team
made up for eight year girls.

199
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,677
You never played Rainbow Six?
You have no idea what you're missing.

200
00:15:57,661 --> 00:15:59,826
I was kinda hoping you
were calling to talk to me.

201
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,737
Sorry I'm just worried about him after

202
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,536
everything that happened yesterday.

203
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:06,354
Lots of people want to pour
Coke on Reuel Abbott...

204
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:09,146
I think there was even a jingle
about it in the 80's.

205
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,683
Why are you so funny?

206
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:14,160
I had a stutter when I was a kid,
humor was my defense.

207
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,061
I was pigeon-toed in
elementary school and

208
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,912
I had to wear leg
braces for two years.

209
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:22,722
- No, shit... Why aren't you funnier?
- Fuck you!

210
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:26,764
- Just keep an eye on him for me.
- Yeah.

211
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,972
Hey, do you want to come over
and play Xbox later?

212
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:38,832
- I will let you know.
- Alright. Bye.

213
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:40,247
Bye

214
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:45,640
Shit!

215
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,890
Shit!

216
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,766
Guys?

217
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,571
Not bad for your first time.

218
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:04,540
My wife did this every
Sunday for many years.

219
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:08,058
She passed recently.
Actually, it was two years ago.

220
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:13,032
Sometimes time doesn't move
as quickly as you want it to.

221
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:14,500
Yeah

222
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:20,476
- So, I never see you in church.
- There's more work to do out here.

223
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:23,976
What about you? Are you married?

224
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,136
I always preferred
boyfriends to husbands.

225
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,501
It would've been nice to have
kids, though.

226
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,644
We had a son.

227
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:36,143
I'm sorry.

228
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:41,447
I'd better go.

229
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,604
If I give you my number,
will you call me?

230
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,353
Absolutely.

231
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:52,895
I forgot just how big American
breakfast's are. Oh Jesus...!

232
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:57,939
Please, don't use the Lord's
name in vain in my house, Joe.

233
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:00,495
I'm sorry, I didn't...

234
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,712
Jesus fucking Christ,
Joe, lighten up! Relax.

235
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:05,522
Look what I have.

236
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:10,230
- Is that Plepler's?
- Yes it is. Mae and Joe brought 'em.

237
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:15,481
Pastries from Plepler's for the Pipers.
Perfect for absorbing the bloodies!

238
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:18,356
They're so good.
I just want to smell them.

239
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:19,883
We need reinforcements, babe.

240
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:22,465
Could you go the cellar
and get a bottle of Tito's?

241
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:23,921
I'm not even drinking. Get us...

242
00:18:23,922 --> 00:18:26,649
- (CRASHING)
- Gordon, Gordon!

243
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,690
- Do you have an epipen?
- Should I get it? Yes, I have it

244
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:35,316
You're having an allergic reaction.
Stay calm, babe. It's gonna be OK

245
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:44,024
Breathe, Gordon. Breathe...

246
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:49,149
That's it. There you go.
Just breathe, Gordon.

247
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:50,821
Are you trying to kill me, Mae?

248
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:54,258
I swear I asked the bakery and
they said there was no peanuts.

249
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,979
You're OK. It's over now.

250
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,738
You never know where
it's going to come from.

251
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,234
- You're choking me, honey!
- Sorry.

252
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,734
- We should go to the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

253
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:06,981
Sometimes,
after an allergic reaction...

254
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:09,920
Trust me... I'm fine.

255
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:14,890
- You're OK, right, you're OK?
- Yeah.

256
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:19,652
You just scared the shit out of me.
Don't you do that again, OK.

257
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,905
Was Vasili Sirin
your superior in Moscow?

258
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:44,821
My group manager.

259
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:50,489
And you had a relationship
with him outside working hours?

260
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:52,489
Of a sexual nature?

261
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:56,031
He forced himself on me.

262
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:58,739
Do you mean he raped you?

263
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:04,323
He was my superior.
He took advantage of his position.

264
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,907
Why didn't you report him?

265
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:14,449
- When did you last meet him?
- It's been years.

266
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:21,157
Why are you asking these questions?
Has anything happened to him?

267
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:26,449
What would you feel if
something had happened to him?

268
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,867
Nothing. I have no loyalty to him.

269
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:37,784
Did he mention his contacts
in the US intelligence service?

270
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:39,659
No.

271
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:44,701
- Did he ever mention Bob Partridge?
- No.

272
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:48,159
Or a man named Joe Turner?

273
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:52,159
I've seen him on the news once.

274
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:59,451
If he contacts you, what would you do?

275
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:02,494
Whatever you order me.

276
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:10,788
Good good.

277
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,854
(LAUGHING FROM OUTSIDE)

278
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,247
Need something?

279
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:46,081
- What is that a 42-footer?
- You know your stuff.

280
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:51,624
When a was a kid, I used to fish
with my dad and Bob.

281
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:59,707
- Check out this marlin I caught.
- Yeah

282
00:21:59,774 --> 00:22:02,499
Actually someone else caught it.

283
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,583
But everyone who was
there took a picture.

284
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:12,328
Now this photo hangs in a
hundred different offices,

285
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:14,983
dens and studies across America.

286
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:19,123
Has there ever been anything
between you and Joe?

287
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:22,699
No, he's like my brother.

288
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:27,543
- He was always kind of a mess.
- It's too bad, he's so cute.

289
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:32,543
- How are things with Tracy?
- They're good.

290
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:36,861
If I wanted to be with someone,
I want to be with someone like Tracy.

291
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:38,402
Yeah, I get that.

292
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:42,545
- You guys seem good?
- Yeah, I mean. But...

293
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,487
Let's just stick with your love life,

294
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:48,611
because if I start complaining about
my husband, I might not stop.

295
00:22:48,654 --> 00:22:51,545
Well now I don't feel bad about
trying to kill him earlier.

296
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:57,840
You know, speaking about
violent impulses, why

297
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:00,695
did Sammy pour Coke on
Reuel Abbott's shoes?

298
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:08,671
- Sammy's got a lot of anger.
- Against Reuel Abbott?

299
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:13,088
He thinks he was involved
in his father's death.

300
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:14,713
Was he?

301
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:21,798
Mae? Tell me.

302
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:28,089
- I shouldn't.
- Mae?

303
00:23:29,823 --> 00:23:33,631
I really haven't talked
about this with anyone.

304
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,060
But ever since I saw how much
Sammy's hurting, I wonder

305
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,364
if I haven't dealt with
everything yet myself.

306
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:45,716
- Joe and I are going out on the boat.
- Really, right now?

307
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:50,340
Yeah. Don't you and the kids
have a birthday party today?

308
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:54,283
Well, It's for me and kids, because
we have so many friends in common.

I just mean we both don't have to go.

310

Oh perfect!
So why don't you take them and

311
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:01,074
then Mae and I'll go out on the boat.

but you need to spare me the schtick!

After Sam died, Jude and I were
at home one night watching a movie

326
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:09,556
and there was a knock on the door.
It was Reuel.

327
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:13,244
He came and said I had
something that I wasn't

328
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:15,581
supposed to have
and he wanted it back...

329
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,974
and he threatened me and my family.

330
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:27,682
What was it?

331
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:31,934
You know, this is in the past
and I have my family to consider.

332

I understand, you...
you don't have to tell me..

333
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:41,267
But I do think you should,
talk to Sidney Thrush.

335

She and I got close
through Wounded Warriors.

336

She was the one who
was spear-heading the

337
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:52,334

against Reuel..

338
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:55,060
When the Frost dossier came out.

339
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:12,020
- All good.
- Got it?

340
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,036
It's about these
samurai who all become

341
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,211
Ronin after their master
commits harakiri

342
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:21,186
because he assaulted this guy named
Kira. Except Kira totally had it coming.

343
00:26:21,253 --> 00:26:24,006
But these 47 Ronin
they all become like

344
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,295
alcoholics, or bums,
so nobody suspects shit.

345
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:30,740
And they wait for over a year
before taking their revenge

346
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:33,796
and after they kill the
guy, they all commit suicide.

347
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,689
It's fucking dark. What's your point?

348
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:41,465
You had the right idea about
getting revenge on Reuel Abbott,

349
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:43,838
you just went about it the wrong way.

350

So you want me to become
a homeless alcoholic?

351
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,106
Don't thing that'll be necessary.

352

00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,796
- Let him in.
- Okay. Let him in.

467
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:13,635
<i>My God, what happened?</i>

468
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:16,655
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

469
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:25,797
<i>- I just need a kiss.
- Does it make you feel better?</i>

470
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:31,256
Jesus!

471
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:36,257
You did well today. Thank you.

472
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:41,715
What made you decide
to go with him on his boat?

473
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:46,008
I didn't really feel that I
had much of a choice.

474
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:48,174
What did you learn?

475
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:56,175
He's erratic, he's emotional
and he's bad with money.

476
00:40:56,242 --> 00:41:01,508
He is the perfect candidate
for recruitment by a foreign power.

477
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:06,467
- Make a plan to see him again.
- I'm out of my element.

478
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:12,635
You're a natural.
You're pushing him, but gently.

479
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,761
"What can a couple guys like
us can do about it?" It was smart.

480
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:21,135
There's no alarm system on the boat.

481
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:43,013
I had no idea married
people fucked this often.

482
00:41:45,955 --> 00:41:47,387
I've got to go.

483
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:53,263
Think about what I said, Joe. The door
is open if you ever wanna feel useful.
