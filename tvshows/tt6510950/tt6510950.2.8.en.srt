1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,598
Previously on "Condor"...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,696
Joe, I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

3
00:00:03,698 --> 00:00:05,038
You're not going to take me to Vasili?

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,307
I'm taking you to the end of track 11.

5
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,318
You can take yourself.

6
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,038
80 Bowery Street, Chevy Chase, Maryland.

7
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,958
Thank you for seeing me, Senator Thrush.

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,787
I saw it. My husband
who I thought I knew

9
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:15,318
ordering the death
of one of our friends.

10
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,630
Reuel has been operating out
of bounds for far too long.

11
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:18,803
I don't want to pressure you

12
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:20,695
into saying something
you're not ready to say.

13
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:21,838
I'm ready.

14
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,543
- You were swatted.
- Like a fly?

15
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:29,003
- This feels personal.
- You would even say childish.

16
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,011
Get in.

17
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:32,398
I think Joe Turner's on
his way to meet Vasili Sirin.

18
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,828
I'm already on him.

19
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,274
Did you follow him?

20
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:37,038
Where has he been?

21
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,009
He had a meeting at Union Station.

22
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:41,645
Who with?

23
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:42,938
I couldn't see.

24
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,158
I can't do this anymore.
I feel like they know.

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,918
You are safe. Not even my
own people know who you are.

26
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,398
It's not your people
that I'm worried about.

27
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,878
He's stopped.

28
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,355
Make a sound and I'll slit your throat.

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,158
Hey, man.

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,640
She found you.

31
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:05,138
I need you to tell me who the mole is.

32
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,129
I think an innocent man is
going to take the fall for him.

33
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:10,078
If you tell me who it is,
then I can clear his name.

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,918
I would like to tell you,
but I don't know.

35
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,918
Volk is hunting you, because he
told you the name of his asset.

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,727
No, he knows he said too much

37
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,576
but he was so drunk he doesn't remember

38
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:21,838
exactly what it is he said to me.

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,638
I am only fucking here
because you used me.

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,398
I'm sorry, Joe.

41
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,000
We should go. The
hunters will be here soon.

42

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,120
Come on.

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Teams of two, 50 meters apart.

46
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,998
- Come with me.
- Where to?

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,560
We'll leave the hunt to the hunters.

48
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,280
Spread out!

49
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,760
Shit.

50
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,678
Jesus Christ. You used me as bait?

51
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,014
Not as bait, as a lure.

52
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:03,518
There's really a difference?

53
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,678
A lure, you hope to get back.

54
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,078
How many people have to
die so that you can live?

55
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you want to surrender?

56
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:17,170
They'll be here any minute.

57
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:19,367
We'll go to the water.

58
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,278
How many people died in Iraq
the first two times around?

59
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,118
Can anybody explain to
me what they died for?

60
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,878
And you really want to go back?

61
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,581
Look, I get it. It's a
fraught subject for you.

62
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,638
You saw a lot of friends die over there

63
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,278
and you want to believe that
their sacrifice was meaningful.

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,220
But knowing what you know now,

65
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:46,422
would you really send
them all over again?

66
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:50,638
What, it's funny? Am I funny to you?

67
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,302
Why can't we just talk
about music or something?

68
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:56,918
I mean, do you ever just go to movies?

69
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,262
Try turning this thing off?

70
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:00,198
Joe, I feel bad for the hamster.

71
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,201
No, man, I am serious.

72
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:03,721
It's not long before Sammy is
old enough to go up there himself.

73
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,726
Would you let him go?

74
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,038
Yeah, I would. Yeah, I would.

75
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,398
Mae, she wouldn't allow it.

76
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,319
But, yeah, if it were
up to me, absolutely.

77
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,561
Ah! How can you possibly say that?

78
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:24,339
All right, Joe. Imagine that there
is a man drowning in this river.

79
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,379
All right? You don't know
the guy. He's nobody to you.

80
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:28,342
For all you know he might
beat his wife and his kids,

81
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,398
and maybe the world's a
better-off place without him.

82
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,895
But all you know is that
there is a human being,

83
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:36,318
screaming over there and you hear him.

84
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,723
So what do you do? Do you just
stand here and watch him die?

85
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,998
Or do you jump in and
try to save his life?

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,658
All right, uh...

87
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,451
The current is too fast.

88
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:48,038
So, if I jumped in there's a good
chance that we both drown.

89
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,850
So, I would, er...

90
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:53,018
find a long branch and
used it to pull him out.

91
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,998
And there's the difference
between you and me, Joe.

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,979
Okay, so you find a branch,
or maybe you don't.

93
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,398
Maybe you pull him out.
Maybe the branch snaps.

94
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,098
Maybe he drowns before
he can grab ahold of it.

95
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,493
But whatever happens you tell yourself

96
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:08,756
that you did everything that you could.

97
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:10,797
But that's a lie because
you didn't risk anything.

98
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,898
So, you would just jump in?

99
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,410
- Without a second thought.
- It's reckless.

100
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,367
- Life is not always safe.
- You would probably die.

101
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,470
- For sure.
- Maybe.

102
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:19,678
You know what? If I lived though,
I wouldn't have any regrets.

103
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,740
That's what I want for my sons.

104
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:24,836
That's what I want for my friends.

105
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,935
Do you know what your problem is?

106
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:28,958
You overthink everything.
You don't commit.

107
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,165
Well, indecision just leads

108
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,020
to somebody else's
decisions being made for you.

109
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:35,909
Sometimes you gotta
fucking jump in the river.

110
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,858
It's moving too fast.

111
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,345
We can ride the current downstream.

112
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:52,926
We've no idea what's downstream.

113
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:54,229
It'll confuse the dogs.

114
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,269
We'll freeze to death!

115
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:57,332
Only if we don't drown in the rapids.

116
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,043
Or we can just stand
here and wait to get shot.

117
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,880
What do you want to do?

118
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:15,918
_

119
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:32,240
What is it? Hey. Hey.

120
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,640
Are you okay? Hey. Hey...

121
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,409
Hey. Look at me. You're okay.

122
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:43,278
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay. Hey.

123
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,231
I've got you. I've got you. You're okay.

124
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:49,838
Say it, say that you're okay.

125
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,880
- I'm okay.
- You're okay.

126
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:54,598
Hey.

127
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,480
Bad dream?

128
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,480
Hey, it's okay.

129
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,782
It's okay.

130
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,480
Hey. Look at me.

131
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,798
Hey. You're back in real life, okay?

132
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,795
We're at your lake house.

133
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:15,098
We are together,
everything is good, okay?

134
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,120
- Yeah.
- Come here. It's okay.

135
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,158
It was just a dream.

136
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,480
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

137
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:29,127
I got you.

138
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,080
It's okay.

139
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
- What are you thinking about?
- The day we met.

140
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,800
You looked so lost the first
time I saw you, so innocent.

141
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,960
I liked you right away.

142
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,053
I just had a panic attack.

143
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:16,575
I had to leave the church
before the service was over.

144
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,254
Is that something that
happens to you often?

145
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:22,325
No, it never happened to me before.

146
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:23,478
Hmm.

147
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,478
What do you think caused it?

148
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,378
I don't know. Maybe God was
sending me out to meet you.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,428
Why would God care?

150
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,198
Oh, I don't know. Maybe he wanted
me to re-examine my life

151
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,438
- or become a better person.
- Hmm.

152
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,838
But why would the
all-powerful God you pray to

153
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,598
care at all?

154
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,920
Maybe for the same reason that
we care about our children.

155
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
Well, I think...

156
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,734
I think you are already a good person.

157
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:03,438
Why?

158
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,718
Because I wouldn't
be with you otherwise.

159
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,758
You dedicate your life to helping
people, to making them safer.

160
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,460
Well, if that's why you like me,
I'd better go to work today.

161
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,880
Reuel?

162
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,120
Who would do such an awful thing?

163
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:07,593
_

164
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,975
I guess that would be weird, right?

165
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:12,680
You and I would be stepbrothers.

166
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,204
My mom always wanted to have more kids.

167
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:20,278
She had a miscarriage
when I was in third grade.

168
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,355
Uh, she and my dad wanted
to have a big family,

169
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:24,760
but, you know after she lost...

170
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,480
Speak of the devil... Hang on, dude.

171
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,759
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, how are you?

172
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:36,307
I was just talking to Anders

173
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:38,638
about you and Mr. Crane having a baby.

174
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,958
Okay, calm down. We're
just away for the weekend.

175
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,518
- Are you having fun?
- I am.

176
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,920
- Mr. Crane's a nice guy.
- Yeah, I think so too.

177
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,486
I wanted to remind you

178
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:55,999
that you have that AP
English prep class tonight.

179
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,155
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- Okay, good.

180
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:00,721
I miss you guys.

181
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,700
- Okay, I'll call you later.
- Bye... bye, bye.

182
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:05,702
Bye.

183
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,798
Turner and Sirin are together.
I could already be blown.

184
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,954
They're trapped in the woods.

185
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,516
We're jamming all the cell signals.

186
00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:19,998
It's only a matter of
time before we get them.

187
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,838
- Fuck!
- Calm down.

188
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,205
Don't tell me to calm down.

189
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,721
Sirin shouldn't know my name
and shouldn't even know I exist.

190
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:28,558
Where are you?

191
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,035
Don't worry about me, I'm safe.

192
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,037
You could be in Moscow by morning.

193
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,571
That's not an option. Moscow
isn't part of my plans.

194
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,373
- I gotta go.
- I'll call you when I know more.

195
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,198
Okay kiddo, have fun on your
camping trip. I love you.

196
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,739
- Was that Anders?
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:47,010
Oh my God, did he tell you what he
and Sammy were just talking about?

198
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,718
No, what were they talking about?

199
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,198
I'm not even gonna go there.

200
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,600
Okay.

201
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,198
- So beautiful.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

202
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,220
You know, I found this
place completely by accident.

203
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:01,222
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:03,198
I was going to meet this guy

205
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,318
and he gave me the wrong address. So...

206
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,558
I ended up here, instead of
where we were supposed to meet.

207
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,993
Life just seemed so simple.

208
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,358
I wanted a piece of
that simplicity for myself.

209
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
I can see why.

210
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,437
Are you hungry, do you want breakfast?

211
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,353
Yes! What are you making?

212
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,708
_

213
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,539
There, you can bring it to him now.

214
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,360
You're the boss, but do
you think it's a good idea

215
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:24,678
to torment him like this?

216
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,398
You're right.

217
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,200
About you being the boss?

218
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,680
Is this your handiwork, Robin?

219
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,800
Why are you making this so personal?

220
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,401
Is it because your husband
left you for another man?

221
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,569
Not that that part matters,

222
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:16,033
but, is that what this is about? Huh?

223
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,398
You see me with my happy family...

224
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,320
and you want to drag us
down with you. Is that it?

225
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Well, you won't succeed.

226
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,440
I didn't do what you say I did
and you're not going to break me.

227
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,960
Do you hear me, Robin?

228
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,720
You're not going to break me.

229
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,758
Challenge accepted.

230
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,267
Ma'am, it's about CHS Phoenix.

231
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:53,478
What about it?

232
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,650
In the draft box of the
Gmail account you use,

233
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:57,119
he sent up an SOS.

234
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,918
What does the message say?

235
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,207
"My people are on to
me. I'm being watched.

236
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,559
I haven't much time. Requesting asylum".

237
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,641
- How shall I handle it?
- Um...

238
00:19:11,456 --> 00:19:13,697
Phoenix has earned his retirement.

239
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:16,238
Initiate protocols.
I'll meet him tonight.

240
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,760
- And get me an overwatch for 20:00 hours.
- Yes, ma'am.

241
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,000
Boo.

242
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,758
- You had me there.
- You were lost in thought.

243
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,274
I was on autopilot.

244
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:12,318
I heard about a man in Norway.

245
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,758
He had his GPS set
for the Arctic tundra.

246
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,812
Hmm.

247
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,958
These days people do what
their gadgets tell them to do.

248
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,718
I miss the simplicity of floor plans.

249
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,380
I have never been able to read maps.

250
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,998
- Do you want to have lunch today?
- Fine.

251
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,760
Cool.

252
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,200
Have you found them?

253
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,198
Hey.

254
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,398
- Got a room?
- What happened to you?

255
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,690
- Oh, I took a swim in the river.
- With your clothes on?

256
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:51,911
Yeah, I didn't want them to get stolen.

257
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:54,622
Great. So, how about that room?

258
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:57,635
- That'll be 60.
- All right.

259
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,560
All right. Thank you.

260
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,009
Do you want to tell me about your dream?

261
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:18,628
What dream?

262
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,703
It wasn't that bad, really.

263
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:27,057
It was bad enough to make you
jump out of bed this morning.

264
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:33,052
It was just about someone from my past.

265
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,038
I'm sorry if I scared you.

266
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,171
That old cliché about the
spy's past catching up with him.

267
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:40,173
Yeah.

268
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,438
Guess my dreams aren't
very original, are they?

269
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,019
Well then, it's a good thing
that your dreams

270
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:47,038
aren't what interest me about you.

271
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,440
Oh, yeah? What does
interest you about me?

272
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:02,039
- I have an idea.
- Yeah?

273
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,798
Mm-hmm.

274
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,360
I think...

275
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:11,318
- I know what your idea is.
- Hmm.

276
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,758
Let's go fishing.

277
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,600
That is exactly what I thought
you were going to say.

278
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:25,006
Uh...

279
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,075
Sorry, I gotta take
this. I'll be right back.

280
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,358
Hey!

281
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,292
So, I heard a rumor that
you went away on vacation

282
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:37,038
and I knew that had to be bullshit

283
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,529
so I'm calling to find out what time

284
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:40,740
you're coming into the office today.

285
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:42,978
This is all just getting
to me, you know?

286
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,798
Oh, you can't run away
from your problems.

287
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,962
Aren't you the one who
told me to recuse myself?

288
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:50,239
That doesn't sound familiar.

289
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:52,125
So, how much time do you feel you need

290
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:53,958
before you can bring
them back to the office?

291
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,718
I'm feeling phantom pain
from losing my right arm.

292
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,640
Aw, aren't you sweet?
I'll see you Monday.

293
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:03,518
I'll see you Monday.

294
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,878
Hey, bud. Bum a smoke?

295
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,504
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

296
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:34,903
- You're Jefferson, right?
- Huh?

297
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,038
Jefferson High.

298
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,582
- Oh. No, no, no, I'm just passing through.
- Really?

299
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,219
I was sure you look familiar.

300
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,267
- Oh, yeah?
- Hmm.

301
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:47,638
No, no, no, I get that a lot, though.

302
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,772
Yeah, I'm getting out of here myself.

303
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:52,318
Oh, yeah? Where you going?

304
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,576
I'm not sure yet.

305
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:56,173
I had a job lined up out
in California for a minute,

306
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:58,378
but it didn't work out.

307
00:24:59,423 --> 00:25:00,524
Right.

308
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:03,285
You know, across the river in D.C.
people no better than you and me

309
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:05,958
are making history as we speak.

310
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,329
But this place might as
well be a million miles away.

311
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:11,751
Yeah?

312
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,998
Hey, mind if I bum one for the road?

313
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,360
Sure, buddy.

314
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,452
- You know what? Take two.
- Thanks.

315
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,760
- Take it easy.
- Mm-hmm.

316
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,240
I need to make a phone call.

317
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,680
There is someone I trust.

318
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,398
I don't trust anybody but you.

319
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,921
Yeah, well, we're stuck
in a motel room...

320
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:58,598
when just over there across the river

321
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,565
there is an entire counter
intelligence case open

322
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:02,940
and being worked by the professionals.

323
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:05,121
I can at least tell them what we know,

324
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,310
and find out what they know.

325
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,749
Okay.

326
00:27:36,035 --> 00:27:38,089
I didn't start this war.
It was declared on me.

327
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:40,038
But I sure as hell
don't want to lose it.

328
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,590
Reuel...

329
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:43,918
- We have the 911 call, right?
- Yes, but...

330
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,358
And voice synthesis confirms, it's him.

331
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,678
Yes, but he's a 17-year-old.

332
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,758
He sent a SWAT team to my home...

333
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,909
... destroyed my lawn. His
age is hardly relevant.

334
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:58,254
The courts are taking
swatting very seriously.

335
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:00,758
They're prosecuting cases
with deterrence in mind.

336
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,693
That's good. Maybe our
little friend will be deterred

337
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:07,238
from future acts of
aggression on his elders.

338
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,280
I'm saying he could go
to jail... for a long time.

339
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,720
Maybe you should turn the other cheek.

340
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,640
The only justice is God's justice.

341
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,760
Fine, hold off, for now.

342
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,600
Okay, boss.

343
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,918
- I've arranged lunch.
- I've got an appointment with Polina.

344
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,320
It is already waiting for us.
Come on, I insist.

345
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,385
The day a fish is caught
is the worst day of its life.

346
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:21,701
- Do you know why?
- Because it dies and gets eaten.

347
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:23,518
Yeah, obviously.

348
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,078
But the other really shitty
reason beyond that is...

349
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,760
Here's a fish...

350
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:30,638
And...

351
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,678
... it's chasing its prey.
Thinking it's about to eat.

352
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,218
Now, imagine you
ordered a cheeseburger...

353
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,219
and you're salivating. You're
about to take that first bite...

354
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:44,260
and all of a sudden,
the cheeseburger eats you.

355
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:45,824
That's what it feels like to be a fish.

356
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,680
- That really fucked up.
- Right?

357
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:05,960
Fresh from the oven.

358
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,840
To our good health.

359
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,007
Come on, eat up. It's sturgeon.

360
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,478
I read about a man
who followed his GPS...

361
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,320
and ended up on the Arctic tundra.

362
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,278
I'm sorry, I'm a little tired.
I didn't sleep very well.

363
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,958
I have a leak at home. Drip,
drip, drip. The whole night.

364
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,038
Sorry. What did you say again?

365
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,480
Nothing.

366
00:31:31,128 --> 00:31:33,637
- Oh, boy!
- Oh, Mae, well done.

367
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,500
- This guy's got some size to him.
- I did it!

368
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:38,238
He's going to cook up nicely!

369
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,238
Yes, he would, if I weren't
throwing him back.

370
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,838
Wh-what?!

371
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,958
- Set him free.
- Is this because of what I said earlier?

372
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,518
He can't breathe.

373
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,749
I was gonna make you
my famous Bass Benedict

374
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:49,795
for breakfast tomorrow.

375
00:31:49,797 --> 00:31:52,398
Well, I want pancakes.

376
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,700
Okay, give him a kiss
before he goes back.

377
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:56,378
No, thanks. You can kiss him for me.

378
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,782
All right. Well, this little guy's

379
00:31:57,784 --> 00:31:59,680
going to have a hell of a story to tell.

380
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,845
All right. Well, I guess we're not
going to be fishing buddies, huh?

381
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:08,368
Well, that's not really the kind of
buddy I was looking for anyway...

382
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,604
- Oh, no. What kind of buddy were you looking for?
- No.

383
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,638
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I...

384
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,138
Let me guess. You need to take it?

385
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,278
Lady gets a prize...

386
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,120
I'll just meet you up at the house.

387
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,958
Hey, did you find Vasili? You all right?

388
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,918
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

389
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,480
- I can't tell you that.
- Why?

390
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,718
Vasili is not in a very, uh...
trusting mood just yet.

391
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,800
- Well, I'll come personally.
- No, that includes you.

392
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,598
Why doesn't Vasili trust me?

393
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,450
I guess he figures the mole
could be just about anyone.

394
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:57,478
And he's feeling very paranoid.

395
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,480
And he is alive, and I think
he'd like to stay that way.

396
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,581
Doesn't he know who the mole is?

397
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,918
Isn't that what started all this?

398
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,598
He was bluffing. He said he
knew that there was a mole...

399
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,878
- Just not who it is.
- How?

400
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,440
His, uh... his friend told him.
Arkady Volk.

401
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,158
My father was a plumber.

402
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,728
He said you could trace a leak...

403
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:34,438
by adding different colors to the
water that flows through the pipes.

404
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,839
Then you go to where the leak
is and see what color comes out.

405
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,600
Watch out for the bones.

406
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,958
I knew one of us was helping the enemy

407
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,558
and I remembered my father's words.

408
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,918
We gave different code names
for my CIA undercover officer...

409
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,918
to each of our people...

410
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:08,718
... to find out which of them
kept meeting Robin Larkin.

411
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,318
Are you okay?

412
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,366
- You got Canary.
- She's can't breathe.

413
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:17,885
Yes, that's the intention.

414
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,838
This is the antidote. Admit
what you did, and you get it.

415
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,478
- Give it to her.
- Are you a traitor?

416
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,438
She admits it.

417
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,718
- Exactly, and this is her punishment.
- Give her the antidote.

418
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,280
Which antidote?

419
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,080
Breathe!

420
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:48,289
No, no, no, no, no.

421
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,838
She was working for the CIA.

422
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,758
Why did you make me
watch, you sick bastard?

423
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,280
Sorry, I need to get this.

424
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:17,238
- You motherfucker, it was you.
- What was me?

425
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,876
You told Sirin about me.

426
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:22,038
Turner is with Sirin, we just spoke.

427
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,078
- Where are they now?
- I don't know.

428
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,734
And I don't care, because
Sirin doesn't know my name.

429
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:27,960
What?

430
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:29,847
You don't even remember
what you told him, do you?

431
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:31,518
You must have been shit-faced.

432
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,377
You told Sirin you had an
asset operating inside the CIA

433
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:36,446
but you never told him my name.

434
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,678
- Sirin's been bluffing.
- I should have told you.

435
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,960
You should have kept
your fucking mouth shut!

436
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,440
But, you know what, I don't care.

437
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,800
I'm out. I'm done. I'm retired.

438
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:56,050
Won't that look suspicious?

439
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:58,273
My best friend just got arrested
for being a double agent.

440
00:35:58,275 --> 00:35:59,954
No-one's going to question the timing.

441
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,358
- We should talk about it.
- No, no, no.

442
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,598
I'm done talking. You
just about got me burned.

443
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,951
If that got back to Moscow,

444
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:10,725
that wouldn't look too good for you.

445
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,975
Have a nice life.

446
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,598
What have you got for me?

447
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,198
It's about Thrush's
investigation into you.

448
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,078
The investigation was culminated
without any substantive findings.

449
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,764
Well, I guess it's been reopened.

450
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:37,119
- Hmm.
- It will cost you ten.

451
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:44,118
Pigeons are synanthropes,
like squirrels, raccoons, rats.

452
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,918
They thrive in environments
made by humans.

453
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,278
Generally considered to be pests.

454
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,798
Synanthropes are tolerated, but unloved.

455
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
You really hurt my feelings.

456
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:01,965
- Five.
- Eight.

457
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,838
Seven.

458
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,228
Senator Thrush is pursuing

459
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,758
an obstruction of justice
charge against you.

460
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,118
- How?
- Someone gave a sealed deposition.

461
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,440
Her name is Mae Barber. That
name mean anything to you?

462
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,598
I'll send the money around.

463
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,636
Do it soon. It'll be
harder to do from prison.

464
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,039
Sorry, mom, this is for work.

465
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,920
I'll be right back.

466
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,638
- Hello.
- We're going to war. Get ready.

467
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,360
- With a 17-year-old boy?
- And the mother.

468
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
_

469
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,952
I know people. I know people
in counter intelligence.

470
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:58,126
I know people in the
deputy director's office.

471
00:37:58,128 --> 00:37:59,750
These people can actually protect you.

472
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:02,478
All those resources are inside the CIA.

473
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,803
As long as the mole is out there...

474
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:09,438
It's better if I just disappear.

475
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,358
Hey, I thought you planned
to pay for your passage.

476
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,823
Not with my life.

477
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,639
But you're willing to watch
people pay with theirs?

478
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:21,523
Not to mention all the people who
are still suffering on your behalf.

479
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,265
History has known
less fair arrangements.

480
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,118
I'm sorry I lied, but I've been
helping the CIA for years.

481
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,480
You don't think I was
expendable in their eyes?

482
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,478
When I told them my life was
in danger, they sent you...

483
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,760
and the passport of a man
who doesn't even look like me.

484
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,640
I risked my life for your country.

485
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,120
Fuck it, then.

486
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:07,505
- We need to get to Volk. It's the only way.
- It's not possible.

487
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:09,101
He's the only one who knows
the identity of the mole.

488
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:10,798
You won't get near him.

489
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,840
Maybe, but I think I
know someone who can.

490
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,238
Leave her out of this.

491
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,599
She's done enough. She's
been pushed past her limit.

492
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:24,479
Yeah, well, it's only
when we're at the limit

493
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:27,640
that we discover what
we're truly capable of.

494
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,120
The overwatch team's in place, ma'am.

495
00:41:05,973 --> 00:41:09,194
It was said that King
Solomon was especially fond

496
00:41:09,196 --> 00:41:12,238
of a loyal servant by the name of Ahiah.

497
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,918
One day King Solomon entertained
the angel of death in his court.

498
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,351
And he noticed a strange
look on Death's face,

499
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:20,800
when he saw Ahiah pouring wine.

500
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,198
Later, when they were alone,
Solomon asked him about it

501
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,158
and Death admitted that he
had been surprised to see Ahiah

502
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,038
for he was on Death's
list for the very next day.

503
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,511
Later that night,
when Death left the court,

504
00:41:35,513 --> 00:41:38,118
Solomon sent his servant away,

505
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,611
insisting that he ride
all the way to Arabia

506
00:41:40,613 --> 00:41:42,800
to flee his date with Death.

507
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,878
That was the last time
Solomon saw Ahiah.

508
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,598
But the next time Solomon
saw the Angel of Death

509
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,960
Death told him a funny story.

510
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,960
I am drunk.

511
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,516
I thought you said you
were never drinking again.

512
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,596
I lied.

513
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,878
He said he was surprised to see
Ahiah that day in Solomon's court

514
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,840
because he hadn't been expecting
to find the servant in Jerusalem.

515
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,717
- Thank you.
- That's great.

516
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,798
- Wow.
- Thank you.

517
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,672
I see you have no problem eating fish,

518
00:42:29,674 --> 00:42:31,278
when someone else catches it.

519
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,718
You've exposed my hypocrisy.

520
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,540
It must have been fun to
catch this big motherfucker.

521
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,934
I think this is the biggest
fish I have ever seen.

522
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,318
It's gigantic.

523
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,518
The Angel of Death was surprised
to find Ahiah in Jerusalem...

524
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,360
because he had been planning to
meet him the next day in Arabia.

525
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:56,993
Mmm.

526
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,560
It's delicious. Are you going
to take a bite of that salmon?

527
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,360
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:12,358
So, the wise king in trying to
help Ahiah escape his destiny

529
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,570
sends his favorite
servant to the very place,

530
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:16,358
where Death was waiting for him.

531
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,198
I wonder what he did to
the servants he didn't like, hmm?

532
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,558
So, what does this story mean? Yeah?

533
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,480
It means...

534
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,798
Thank you.

535
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,959
- Sam Barber?
- Yeah?

536
00:43:34,961 --> 00:43:35,979
You're under arrest.

537
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:39,286
Stand up for me, spin around and
put your hands behind your back.

538
00:43:39,288 --> 00:43:43,647
Stay there, right there.
Spread and hold still for me.

539
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,680
Ekaterina.

540
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,294
I think we have a friend in common.

541
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,520
I need your help.
