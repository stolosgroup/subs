1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
Previously on Condor...

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,820
What was the point of killing
Partridge and setting up Gordon

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,296
if I'm not free to live my life?

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,113
Tell me what I need to
do to be done and I'll do it.

5
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:09,190
Isn't it obvious?

6
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,880
Neither one of us will be
safe until he's eliminated.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,406
You look like a corpse.

8
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:16,226
You would already be dead
if I hadn't helped you.

9
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:18,914
I'm done listening to you.
- Then listen to yourself.

10
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:21,509
You would already be dead
if I hadn't helped you.

11
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,827
If you don't help us then this goes
to the Russian embassy in 24 hours.

12
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:25,336
How?

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,520
We lure Volk to a secure location..

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,048
..we kidnap him and then we force
the identity of the mole out of him..

15
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:31,728
..by any means necessary.

16
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:33,849
Turner's blackmailing me.

17
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:36,216
He wants me to lure you into a trap.

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,068
Drop the charges.

19
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:38,496
This is a terrible time, Mae.

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,301
You found out that I spoke to Senator
Thrush and you had him arrested?

21
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,028
Mae! I deeply regret it.

22
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,724
I'm so sorry you had to hear that.

23
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:48,021
So, all the horrible shit I've read
about you online, it's...it's all true.

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,385
I don't have Mr.Abbott
for you right now Ms.Larkin.

25
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:52,736
Tell him I know he planted the Piper story.

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,590
Why would Mr.Abbott leak a
story that makes us look bad...

27
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,206
and you and your department look good?

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
That's the part that fucking scares me.

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,800
Gordon, come on.
Breathe!

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,760
You really think you can trust this
woman to betray her own people?

31
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,960
I don't have a choice.
But neither does she.

32
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,200
I will do what you asked.
Stay by the phone. I'll be in touch.

33
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:13,570
Where the fuck have you been?

34
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,250
I got played.
- By who?

35
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:16,768
Reuel, and the Russians.

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,240
Phoenix is ​​fucking gone.
Probably dead.

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,080
Give Phoenix time.
She'll reach out when she feels she can.

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,120
I said 'she', didn't I?

39
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:26,989
What the fuck, Trace?

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,913
I got a safe house.

41
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:36,545
It's not really a safe
house, but it'll work.

42
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, let's do it.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,200
You're a good friend, Trace.

45
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm at the house. They're not
here yet. Guess I'll get cosy.

46
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,560
What did he say?

47
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,320
I didn't know we were
playing hide and seek.

48
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,800
He gave me an address.
- So?

49
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:59,443
That's all.

50
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:05,685
He got you into a metal concert
to give you an address?

51
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,040
It was more punk.
- But why?

52
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,880
Perhaps he was afraid of being
trapped in a more public place.

53
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Or he didn't want me to hear
what he said to you.

54
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,040
Or he doesn't want you to trust me.

55
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,200
If you can't understand us, you
might think we're on to something.

56
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,880
Then the man is a real genius.

57
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,400
After you...

58
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,400
How's the patient doing?

59
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,585
He has to stay off
that leg for a week.

60
00:07:58,085 --> 00:07:59,585
If it was some other week...

61
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,080
You should quit.
You'll live longer.

62
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:09,640
What about all those suckers
who quit and then die young?

63
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,794
Is that something
you're worried about?

64
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,480
Dying young?

65
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,156
My father died young.

66
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:28,054
Well, he was with the CIA.

67
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,680
I think I understand
what happened to Sam.

68
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:53,400
You can become so single-minded...

69
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,680
in the defense of your own principles...

70
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,640
that you forget to follow them.

71
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,200
I can see how Sam
lost himself to that.

72
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,520
And what about you?

73
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,596
Have you lost yourself?

74
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,299
I check now and then,
but not yet.

75
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,300
I don't know what you
and Trace are doing,

76
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:25,048
but please take
care of each other.

77
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,440
Go on...

78
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,962
Don't tell anybody.

79
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,040
I'm good at keeping secrets.

80
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:06,800
You ready?

81
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,176
How you feeling?

82
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,243
Like the cheese in a mousetrap.

83
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,203
Makes two of us.

84
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,880
Hi, Paula.

85
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,800
No, I didn't.

86
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:24,800
Eva?

87
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,240
I am so sorry.

88
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,788
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

89
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,680
So this is a CIA safe house.

90
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,040
No. We still don't know who the
mole is so we can't trust the Agency.

91
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:46,760
So who lives here?

92
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,400
No-one. The owner died
last week. No family.

93
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
Wait.

94
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,983
I've been watching
the place all night.

95
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,983
They're inside. They're alone.

96
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,640
Who was that?

97
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Someone I asked to come
earlier, for my safety.

98
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,280
You mean our safety.

99
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes, that's what I meant.

100
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,560
He said they're in there alone.

101
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,280
What are we waiting for?

102
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,400
Did you think I would
let you do this alone?

103
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,040
The coast is clear.

104
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,840
The house is empty.

105
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,320
There's nobody there.

106
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,520
You are a very good liar.

107
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,280
If you were betrayed,
it wasn't by me.

108
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,120
It is especially clever how
you make me believe you.

109
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,480
We need to hurry.

110
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,479
So, all the horrible shit I've read
about you on the web, it's all true.

111
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,155
Joe, he's coming to.

112
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,030
I remember you.
Obviously, you know who I am.

113
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:53,049
Or at least you think you do.

114
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:54,856
I used to know myself, too.

115
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:58,771
Things that I was
and wasn't capable of.

116
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,452
Torturing someone
for information..

117
00:17:01,468 --> 00:17:02,608
..or for any reason, really.

118
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,148
was something that would
have fallen under the heading

119
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,650
of things that I could
not imagine myself doing.

120
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,360
Or being a part of.

121
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,368
The trick is to get yourself
there a little at a time .

122
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,800
To ask yourself, "Where is the
line that I simply will not cross?"

123
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,400
And then you move it.

124
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,320
Just a little.

125
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,301
And then you just move it again.

126
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,466
And then you move it again..

127
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,680
..and again..
.. and again..

128
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,200
Until you barely even recognize
the person you used to be.

129
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,800
So. Who is your mole?

130
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,280
So she chose you?

131
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,680
Dirty whore.

132
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
I think he is jealous.

133
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,600
Maybe he saw you take
my cock in your mouth.

134
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:20,240
The key in this business
is emotional detachment

135
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,400
One must prepare oneself
for the possibility of betrayal.

136
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,240
I liked her, but she's a fucking
whore, so it's just business.

137
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
That's all it can be with
a whore. All it can be...

138
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,280
Maybe we are all whores.

139
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,640
It is a rare individual who maintain
their honor in this profession.

140
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:45,919
This is a fucking circus.

141
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,816
Yeah, I know. Let me try
something. Two minutes.

142
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,800
Your uncle, for example.
He was given a choice that night.

143
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,880
Not by me, of course, but by the
man you are so interested to find.

144
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,765
Bob was told it could look like
a suicide or a home invasion.

145
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,880
But for a home invasion, his wife
would have to be killed, as well.

146
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Your uncle chose honorably.

147
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,160
Joe, that's enough, that's enough...
- Fuck off!

148
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,680
Don't touch me.
- Take a minute...

149
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:54,752
Are you all right?

150
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,376
What the fuck were you doing?
You're supposed to have my back.

151
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,160
I do have your back.
It just has to look good.

152
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,000
This was not our plan.

153
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,160
This is a new plan, where
we both get what we want.

154
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,143
This is a fucking mess.
- Yeah, I know.

155
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,896
We have to shut this down.
He's not going to break.

156
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,570
Not like this, he won't.

157
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,770
He is trained to withstand
much more than a beating.

158
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,383
So what do you want us to do?

159
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:32,587
Chop off his fingers

160
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:35,456
and when you run out of fingers,
you use your imagination.

161
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,080
What are you talking about?

162
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,960
Where are you going?

163
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,000
He needs water.

164
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,680
We are torturing him.
- I know how it works.

165
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,480
Brute force is not working.

166
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,143
I'm gonna try a
different approach.

167
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,143
Let her try.

168
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,280
Water?
- No.

169
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,160
I was afraid
you would trick me.

170
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,040
I prepared for it,
and yet you did it.

171
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,553
Tell me.
How did you do it?

172
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,200
By not knowing what I was going to do
until the moment arrived.

173
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,560
By just being true to myself.

174
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,720
You could do that too.

175
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,160
Adapt to the circumstances
and make sure you survive.

176
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,440
They'll make a deal with you.

177
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,000
Cigarette?
- Go ahead.

178
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,080
I won't bite you.

179
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,240
First I am betrayed
by my best friend.

180
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,960
Then by a woman
for whom I had feelings.

181
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,120
I fell for it again.

182
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,680
I haven't been playing
a game with you.

183
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,955
My feelings for you are real.

184
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:45,087
But I think it's too late for that now.

185
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,200
My grandfather was in Germany
during the occupation..

186
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,440
after the Great Patriotic War.

187
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,840
He fell for a German beauty.

188
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,120
They had a child
and she also fell for him.

189
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,600
In that order.

190
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,360
At the start of their relationship
the love came from one side.

191
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,654
But pure love
defies logic..

192
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:23,720
and all other considerations.

193
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,840
If I saw a future for us
I would tell them everything.

194
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
I'm tired of it, Katya.

195
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,880
Darling...darling...

196
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:09,880
Who is it? Who is it?
Tell me. Who is it?

197
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,240
Tell me who it is. Who is it?

198
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,720
He's dead.

199
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,080
Piece of shit.

200
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,600
Sorry. I rang the bell.
- Carla.

201
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:32,501
I just came from
the Director's office.

202
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:36,095
Nobody above GS15 showed
up for work at the CIMC today..

203
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,228
and you're the only
one on the seventh floor

204
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:40,761
who knows the details
of the Piper investigation

205
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,280
Now that he's dead..
- What?

206
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,642
He killed himself in custody.

207
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,135
Now everyone's playing catchup.

208
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,994
Why?

209
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:50,896
Because a CIA officer...

210
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:52,713
No. Why did he kill himself?

211
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:55,944
I imagine being a captured
Russian double-agent..

212
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:58,982
But he was innocent.
- I'm sorry?

213
00:25:58,982 --> 00:26:00,582
He wasn't the mole.

214
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,659
How could you know that?

215
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,893
Because I was in Bob's office
the night that he was killed.

216
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,136
And I looked inside his files.

217
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:07,869
And I didn't see anything.

218
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:10,985
So I knew Gordon's file must
have been planted afterwards.

219
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,057
Why didn't you say anything?

220
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:16,828
I wanted to sabotage Robin Larkin.

221
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,880
You.. you knew there was
still a mole in the Agency

222
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,258
who could be hurting
and killing our own people,

223
00:26:26,258 --> 00:26:29,458
and you didn't say anything
because of a vendetta?

224
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:36,243
I think I made a wrong turn a
long time ago and I've been..

225
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,520
and I've been
picking up ever since.

226
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,124
I fear that I'm...

227
00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:48,672
terribly, terribly lost.

228
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,600
I see your wound is already
healing, comrade.

229
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,640
I have some questions for you
about that day.

230
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,560
How did you end up at that lake?

231
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,560
People traced Sirin
to a remote house.

232
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,200
We lured Arkady Volk to the house
in order to separate him from his team.

233
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,667
To get him alone?

234
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,736
He wasn't alone. There
was a woman with him.

235
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,120
We took them by force.

236
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,520
It was a trap.
They were waiting for us.

237
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,080
The woman escaped.

238
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,520
I escaped.
- How?

239
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,160
They were torturing people.

240
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,240
We don't torture people.

241
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,000
Did he give up the
informant's name?

242
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,067
No.

243
00:27:39,223 --> 00:27:43,355
Would he have
broken under pressure?

244
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,040
No, I don't think so.

245
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,600
Where was Robin
Larkin in all of this?

246
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:53,478
I haven't seen her since
before Gordon's arrest.

247
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:57,640
I mean, where do you think
her disappearance fits in?

248
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,520
I assume she was killed
to protect the mole.

249
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,000
But she disappeared
after Piper was in custody.

250
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,240
Unless you have reason to
suspect Piper wasn't the mole.

251
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,680
I think he was set up.

252
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,600
I just don't know who
the actual mole is.

253
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:26,046
Mae?
- Hello?

254
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,073
Hey..
- Hey.

255
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,135
I'm glad you're okay.

256
00:28:36,135 --> 00:28:38,174
Yeah. I was worried when
you didn't come to the hospital.

257
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,174
Sorry.

258
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:46,895
I can't...
- Okay.

259
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,320
Not after Gordon.

260
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,891
I explained that.

261
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:53,389
You said everything
was going to be okay.

262
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,040
And I trusted you.

263
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,600
I was at their home with
you when you pulled that shit.

264
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,200
He was our friend.
- I know.

265
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,618
You don't have all
the facts, though.

266
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:10,961
No, I don't.

267
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,080
And you can't tell me
all the facts, can you?

268
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,240
That's exactly why I was reluctant
to go out with you in the first place.

269
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,440
I don't want to repeat
all the mistakes.

270
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:27,215
I wish you had just
one small idea ...

271
00:29:27,343 --> 00:29:32,543
of all the shit I've had to do to try
and make this work between us.

272
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
I really wish you knew.

273
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,880
More classified bullshit.
- Yeah, that's my fucking job.

274
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,070
Which is exactly the problem.

275
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,760
Maybe you should have thought
of that before you led me on.

276
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,560
I think you led yourself on.
- Fuck you!

277
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,640
Get out of my house.

278
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Are you fucking deaf?
- Is everything okay?

279
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,750
Yeah!

280
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,080
Tracy was just leaving.

281
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,720
Goodbye, Mr. Crane.

282
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,440
Goodbye, Mr. Crane.

283
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,240
Is everything okay?

284
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,630
Yeah.

285
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,040
Sorry.

286
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,691
I wouldn't have expected
the deputy director of the CIA

287
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,291
to show up to the funeral of a traitor.

288
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,883
We both know that
Gordon wasn't a traitor.

289
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,938
The CIA knows it, too,
only they'd never admit it.

290
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,760
I've been to a
number of funerals..

291
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,360
for people whose deaths I
felt personally responsible..

292
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,080
but I am determined
that this will be my last.

293
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,040
And what if I determined
to kill you? Just to make sure?

294
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,200
You’re getting a taste for it, Joe.
Be careful.

295
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,781
Anyway I am retiring and I
though you might want to know

296
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,859
that intend to make
a full confession.

297
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:02,440
That's between you and your god.
It's of no interest to the rest of us.

298
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:10,461
Which is why I'm planning to avail
myself of a more public forum.

299
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,520
Take care of yourself, Joe.

300
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:24,894
Capitol Hill was buzzing
today with preparations for..

301
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,360
CIA deputy director Rueul
Abbott's much anticipated testimony.

302
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:31,535
Not since William Colby
gave up the Agency's...

303
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,375
Are you okay?

304
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:36,740
...family jewels back in the 1970s
has the intelligence community...

305
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:38,814
...been so on the edge of its seat.

306
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:42,775
Sure to be a central focus of questioning
are the controversial allegations...

307
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:46,026
made by late CIA
officer Marty Frost.

308
00:33:46,095 --> 00:33:50,911
If the deputy director confirms even some
of the information in the Frost dossier...

309
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:52,686
...which the Agency has denied...

310
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,160
..the ripple effects could spread throughout
the American intelligence community.

311
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,120
For more on the Abbott testimony,
we go now to the Capitol.

312
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,760
I won't scream.

313
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,320
I know.

314
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,120
Hey, how you doing?
- Reuel Abbott is dead.

315
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:46,696
What?

316
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,080
Turn on the TV.

317
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,440
Hold on..

318
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:59,274
Our sources have just confirmed that
deputy director of the CIA Reuel Abbott

319
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,787
has been found dead
after an apparent drowning..

320
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,939
Yeah. I'll call you back.

321
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:04,876
Authorities have not yet
released any official information.

322
00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:07,267
Theories have already
been floated on social media..

323
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:09,176
..around the suspicious
timing of the death,

324
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,280
just ahead of Mr. Abbott's
planned testimony before Congress.

325
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,960
Time's up, Mr. Crane.

326
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,040
Bastards.
-Congratulations.

327
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,960
Well deserved.
- We're going to miss you.

328
00:36:18,015 --> 00:36:20,295
Hey, I think I got one..

329
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:21,767
Yeah!

330
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,512
Bring him in.
Get him, get him!

331
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,080
That's a big one.
- We can eat this guy.

332
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,120
Looks good. We'll keep him.

333
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,600
Look at that!
- Good!

334
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,221
All right. I'm a fisherman.
- Well done.

335
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,720
I'm not armed.
- You can never be too careful.

336
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,520
Mind if I join you?

337
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,720
Surprised to see me?

338
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,400
No. After what we went through..

339
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,840
..we are each a natural target
for recruitment by the other.

340
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,606
If you hadn't approached me,
I probably would have approached you.

341
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:27,949
I don't need to recruit you, Potoo.

342
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:30,656
Am I supposed to
understand what that means?

343
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,080
I recognized your voice at the lake.
I couldn't figure out from where.

344
00:37:35,175 --> 00:37:37,034
And then it hit me.

345
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:39,496
You see, I was in the car
that night when you called Volk..

346
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,000
to tell him that Joe Turner was
on his way to meet Vasili.

347
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,320
You are just like me.
Playing both sides.

348
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,720
You were a Volk's man at
the safe house, weren't you?

349
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,127
The one who was
supposed to have his back.

350
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,480
You untied him and you shot him,
to make yourself look like the hero.

351
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,160
You sound as
ridiculous as a spy novel.

352
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,160
A smart play. I would
have done the same thing.

353
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,080
If what you're saying is true..

354
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:18,560
..then wouldn't we
have dirt on each other?

355
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,278
Don't those things just...
- Cancel each other out?

356
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:23,779
Yeah.
- My thoughts exactly.

357
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,440
Why are you here?

358
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,240
I'm back with the SVR. I need
to make sure my secret is safe.

359
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,000
Is it?
- I'm retired.

360
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,920
Yeah, from the CIA.
- From everything.

361
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,824
So you won't be filing any
new reports with Moscow?

362
00:38:39,824 --> 00:38:40,824
No.

363
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,320
That's good.

364
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,680
Have a nice life.

365
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,400
What are you doing here?

366
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,988
I've been thinking about this place a lot.
- Oh yeah. What about it?

367
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,760
How long have you had it?
And how much it must have cost you.

368
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,160
How long have you been doing this?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

369
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,600
I'm retired.
- Yeah, from the CIA.

370
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,120
From everything.

371
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,445
So you won't be filing any
new reports with Moscow?

372
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:16,226
No.

373
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,160
I was playing her. I was going to recruit
her and make her my asset. That's it.

374
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:23,688
Only, you were only late.

375
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:26,358
She's my asset now.

376
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,186
She's a Russian agent.

377
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:30,241
You're seriously going
to believe the word of...

378
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,366
She's very convincing.

379
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:35,158
This is what they do.
And they're good at it.

380
00:40:35,322 --> 00:40:36,423
They did it to Gordon,
and now they're doing it...

381
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:37,880
It's what you do.

382
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,920
So you've made up
your mind, then?

383
00:40:44,537 --> 00:40:45,537
Yeah

384
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,360
You're always a little out of
your depth, aren't you?

385
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,655
People in the country
are..more trusting.

386
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,496
They tend to leave their doors unlocked.
They don't even have alarm systems.

387
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:08,909
So, you're just going
to shoot me, Joe?

388
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:10,643
Isn't that what you did to Bob?

389
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:19,033
You know, I told myself that I
was going to calmly tell you..

390
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:20,936
..what I was going to do to you.

391
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,320
Give you a chance to say your piece.

392
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,720
Because I wanted you to know
that this is not an act of vengeance.

393
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,120
It is justice.

394
00:41:31,983 --> 00:41:35,303
But you know what,
I was lying to myself.

395
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,320
Because the truth is,
what I really want..

396
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,890
..is to see that look on your face
when you realize that it is all over.

397
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,880
I have heard stories about what happened
at the lake. Is it true?

398
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,800
Depends what you heard.

399
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,520
I was friends with Tracy Crane.

400
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,160
He was one of the good guys.
It is unbelievable that he is no longer there.

401
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,517
Do you want to
know what I heard?

402
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:40,457
What did you hear?

403
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,080
It was retribution by the
Russians for Gordon Piper.

404
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,040
For outing their mole.

405
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,520
A year ago this place was knee-deep
in Boko Haram and ISIS in West Africa.

406
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,720
But we shifted focus.
It's a new game.

407
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,560
We're playing chess with the Chinese
and Africa is the board.

408
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,720
Half of this room is working to support
US military positions on the continent..

409
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,040
..and the other half is trying to sabotage
the Chinese attempts to do likewise.

410
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,480
It gets messy but it's
us or them, you know?

411
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,840
I'm one seat over. Let me
know if you want to grab a smoke.

412
