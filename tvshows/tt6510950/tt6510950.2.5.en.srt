1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:01,695
Previously on "Condor"...

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,363
Why are you spending
so much time with Gordon?

3
00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:05,295
I like him. He's a nice guy.

4
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,037
I know you too well to believe that.

5
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:08,550
I am sorry... I'm sorry.

6
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:11,513
Pull up a chair. Have
breakfast with the Pipers.

7
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:13,577
We are about to run out of money.

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,891
I'll get the money.

9
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,687
On the ground! Get on
the fucking ground!

10
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:18,081
Drop the gun! Drop the weapon!

11
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:20,273
I sent a SWAT team
to Reuel Abbott's house.

12
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:21,393
What?

13
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,127
He threatened me and my family.

14
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:24,401
Reuel Abbott?

15
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:27,322
Talk to Sidney Thrush.

16
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:29,540
Vasili Sirin jumped.

17
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:32,376
He reportedly knew
Volk's agent in the CIA.

18
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,985
I was going to be killed.

19
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,988
Now we're both dead.

20
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:39,850
We should have a plan to
meet up on the other side.

21
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,290
Union Station. Track 11.

22
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:43,908
Everyone has something to hide.

23
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:47,010
As long as you don't hide Sirin.

24
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:50,706
You got Gordon served to you by
a single source inside the SVR

25
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,560
whose identity is known only to you.

26
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:55,521
Maybe you were the one
who was approached.

27
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:57,685
Gordon fits the mold of a double agent.

28
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:01,393
Career stalled out, money
problems, marital problems.

29
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:04,185
Which is exactly why
they would set him up.

30
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,466
Fuck, man. You really
came through for me.

31
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,643
To you, my friend.

32
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:13,310
Emily said something
to me at the hospital.

33
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:16,000
I asked you to kill the men
that killed your uncle.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,074

36
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:18,218
I work a lot, so it's just
easier to crash on the couch.

37
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,111
And my husband and I
are recently divorced...

38
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:22,643
so there's that.

39
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,432
I'm choosing to trust you, Joe.

40
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:27,744
Okay.

41
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:31,983
I have an asset inside
the SVR's DC rezidentsiya.

42
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:34,404
A week ago, he passed me a file

43
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:38,876
indicating that Gordon Piper
was working for the Russians.

44
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:42,268
Who is your asset there?

45
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,284
The only people that
know my source exists

46
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,525
are me, Tracy and now you.

47
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:48,916
But the identity of my source
is only known to me.

48
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:52,393
- The translation's in the blue folder.
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,724
Gordon met with this guy last night

50
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,477
and took a bunch of money from him.

51
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,219
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

52
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,477
We had a team on him, but he lost us.

53
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,996
Clearly knows what he's doing,

54
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,143
which means he's
probably not a civilian.

55
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:05,994
I don't want to move
until we know who he is,

56
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:07,101
and we can't wait too long

57
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,835
'cause once Gordon gets
wind he's under suspicion

58
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:11,913
then his handlers will
take him out of the US

59
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:12,980
and the next time we see him

60
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,982
his face will be on a
Russian postage stamp.

61
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,006
Yeah.

62
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,240
Why did you come back here?

63
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:21,264
I thought you said you
were out of your element.

64
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:24,440
I was. I'm not an operative,

65
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,854
but I am a very good analyst, so...

66
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:31,876
I mean, why do you suddenly care?

67
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:39,477
I agreed to help Vasili Sirin.

68
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:43,876
And so his blood is on my hands.

69
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,375
I just need to see this through.

70
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,099
Welcome back.

71
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,520
_

72
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:59,477
You saved my life. Thank you.

73
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:04,727
I saved my own life.
You just happened to be there.

74
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:07,375
We have to go.

75
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,059
- I'm Tim. I'm your driver.
- Hey, Tim.

76
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:26,083
- Just the one bag?
- Traveling light. I'll be right there.

77
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:35,185
Hi, it's me. I'm going to be
leaving town for a while.

78
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:40,393
Who knows, maybe I'll find
my way to Budapest after all.

79
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,203
You know where the key is,
if you need a place to stay.

80
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,792
I love you.

81
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:19,706
Is this your boyfriend's house?

82
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,143
The one I can thank for my clothes.

83
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,976
No. Someone the station
doesn't know about.

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,261
My occasional lover.

85
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:33,268
A professor, who is
on sabbatical in Spain.

86
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:36,768
The station knows more than you think.

87
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:42,810
I was very careful.
I have to protect my reputation.

88
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:48,310
Who does your professor think you are?

89
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,476
Richard knows me as Kathy,

90
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,101
a traveling pharmaceutical
rep from Virginia.

91
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,059
Peter the Great organized parties

92
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,852
where someone else
played the role of Tsar.

93
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:04,602
You may be protecting your reputation

94
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:07,810
but you also enjoy acting.

95
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:10,643
I am obviously very convincing.

96
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:14,651
Maybe because there's a grain
of truth in your performance.

97
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,477
If you're trying to prove
that I still care about you...

98
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:24,185
the fact that you're still
alive should be enough.

99
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:28,435
But if I was taken in,
I would be foolish

100
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:32,876
and you know I'm not a fool.

101
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:36,607
When you contact the CIA,

102
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:40,584
you must not tell
them that I helped you.

103
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:45,179
I would like one more favor.

104
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,009
- I had a date with someone...
- Who?

105
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,185
A friend.

106
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,974
Does your friend work for the CIA?

107
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:58,919
Not anymore.

108
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,768
Shit!

109
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:12,611
Want to take a shower with me?

110
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:16,101
I showered last night.

111
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,560
- What?
- I showered last night.

112
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,250
You don't know what
you're missing out on.

113
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:24,375
I'm sure I've got a pretty good idea.

114
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:30,101
- Good morning.
- Morning.

115
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,039
Did you get any sleep?

116
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,063
No.

117
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,001
But I think I figured something out.

118
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,059
Hmm.

119
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,844
I need coffee first.

120
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:42,350
- Do you want some?
- Uh, yeah, thanks.

121
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:52,687
Hey...

122
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,684
Where did you sleep last night?

123
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,882
I'm sorry, I should have called.

124
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,268
- Cream and sugar?
- Uh, just black, thank you.

125
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,472
Did you meet someone?

126
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,518
Can we talk about this later?

127
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:07,642
Yes, we are definitely
talking about this later.

128
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,666
Okay, bye.

129
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,667
- Why are you in such a good mood?
- I am taking a sick day.

130
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:25,185
- Are you feeling okay?
- I feel incredible.

131
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,044
You should call in sick, too.
We can play hookey.

132
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:28,477
I have a meeting.

133
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:32,602
- Well, reschedule.
- Jesus, Gordon. Come on, stop it...

134
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:36,468
Let's get a hotel suite,
order room service..

135
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:39,748
And fuck and drink and eat and fuck.

136
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:41,143
What do you say?

137
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:45,210
I say that we can't
afford a hotel suite.

138
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:46,230
Yes, we can.

139
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:48,237
And as the person in this household

140
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:50,185
most familiar with our
personal finances...

141
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,626
I got a little money.

142
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:57,477
- How much is a little money?
- How much... a lot.

143
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:00,959
- You just said a little.
- Size is relative...

144
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,566
Where did this money come from, Gordon?

145
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:09,351
It's kind of like an advance
for my next job.

146
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,359
- You're leaving the agency?
- Yeah.

147
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,895
When did you decide this?

148
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,477
Oh God, I've wanted to for years.

149
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:20,190
I was just afraid to hop off my lily pad

150
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:21,810
without knowing where I
was going to land first.

151
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,477
And where are you landing?
Where are we landing?

152
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,774
I don't want to bore you with the
details right now. Come on.

153
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:29,226
Gordon, I don't find details boring.

154
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,876
Remember what I said
about you trusting me?

155
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:51,301
Hi, Arlene. I need to move
today's meetings.

156
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,005
I'm taking a day off.

157
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:59,083
Okay. Let's see what you got.

158
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,283
That is a surveillance photo.
I've seen it before.

159
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:15,334
Yeah, so have I. In Bob's office,
the morning I was attacked.

160
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,501
Okay. What's your theory?

161
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,739
What happened to your lip?

162
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:30,123
I cut it shaving.

163
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,510
When did you start shaving?

164
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:34,693
I don't know.. a couple of months ago.

165
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:37,643
- Who taught you?
- I found a video on YouTube.

166
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,409
You can learn a lot online.

167
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,833
Yeah, there's also a lot of things
on there that aren't true.

168
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:48,083
Do you ever read any of
the stuff about Dad?

169
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:52,177
I think it would be too painful.

170
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:54,518
And I don't know if I want to know.

171
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,061
I'd like to preserve what good memories

172
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,152
I still have left of your father.

173
00:13:58,176 --> 00:13:59,671
Yeah. And once you've
been down that route,

174
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:02,435
it's a hard thing to do.

175
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,083
But at least I'm not living a lie.

176
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:10,918
- You think I'm living a lie?
- I was just talking about me.

177
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:13,459
I'm going go get ready for school.

178
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,188
Fuck!

179
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:00,375
No, no, no, no, no! That is bullshit!

180
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:08,450
Saved by the bell. Huh?

181
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,643
I prefer not to make my big comeback.

182
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,876
Grab your stuff.

183
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:21,849
- Hey. Great. Thanks.
- I'll just grab my things.

184
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:24,287
- Hey, Mom.
- Can I get you a coffee? Pop-Tart?

185
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:26,778
No, thank you. I'm fine.

186
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,918
- Don't forget your boots.
- Okay!

187
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:32,248
Are you going somewhere this weekend?

188
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,510
Cal is taking him camping.

189
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,451
Yeah? Just the two of them?

190
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,709
No, they're going with some of
Cal's friends and their sons.

191
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,125
Cal and I have been
married for 10 years.

192
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:46,736
Cal is like a second father to him.

193
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,853
Yeah. No, of course.

194
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,560
- Hey! You're going camping...
- Yeah.

195
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,271
- Have fun and be safe, eh?
- Okay. Bye, Dad.

196
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:57,021
- Love you, Bye.
- Bye.

197
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:40,755
_

198
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,458
- Hey. Missed anything?
- Morning.

199
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:54,334
Piper's taking the day off.

200
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:59,016
- Anything else?
- He showed up late last night.

201
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,322
- Changed his mind, wants to help.
- Help how?

202
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:04,310
He's going over the files.

203
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:08,403
- And you think that's a good idea?
- You might think so.

204
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,627
- He's taking your side.
- What's my side?

205
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:14,834
He thinks Gordon's been set up.

206
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:29,870
It's the same photo. From Bob's office.

207
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:31,135
- You're sure?
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,601
I assumed that the file was Bob's

209
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,467
and that the Russians were
trying to make it disappear

210
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:35,470
to protect their mole.

211
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:38,143
But, what if...? It was
put there as a plant.

212
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,401
In the hopes that someone
would eventually find it

213
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:42,557
- to falsely frame Gordon as the mole.
- Yes.

214
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:43,998
Now, the only question would be,

215
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,894
how no one else found it before I did.

216
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,880
That's hardly the only question.

217
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:50,560
So your source set you up?

218
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,643
Or he was used.

219
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,612
Okay, I have a stupid question.

220
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:58,143
Why couldn't the Russians and
Bob have the same photo?

221
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,894
Maybe Bob had his own
source inside the SVR.

222
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:02,792
If it was leaked to you, why
couldn't it be leaked to him?

223
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:03,856
Right. Uh...

224
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:10,707
- You okay?
- Yeah. It only hurts when I think.

225
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:14,994
Look, I would love
to believe all of this.

226
00:18:15,018 --> 00:18:17,174
And up until last night when
Gordon took the money

227
00:18:17,198 --> 00:18:18,808
I thought he was being set up.

228
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,193
And you can plant fake files,

229
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:24,160
but how do you make an
innocent man take a pay-off?

230
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:27,206
Well, taking money isn't
the same as treason.

231
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,914
We still don't know
what the money's for,

232
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:31,560
or who gave it to him.

233
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:33,247
I'm going to set up a
meet with my source

234
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:35,292
and find out what he knows.

235
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,714
You've been a naughty girl.

236
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:33,185
What evil deed has come to light?

237
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:36,236
You and Volk never came back yesterday.

238
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,820
He has been watching
you since you arrived.

239
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,477
We ran a case yesterday.

240
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:43,878
- What case?
- The kind you don't talk about.

241
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:48,393
- Where did you go afterwards?
- Home to my place.

242
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:53,542
- Did you invite him in?
- He invited himself.

243
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:02,560
I'd fuck him. He's handsome.

244
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:04,946
But maybe you are
looking for someone else?

245
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,375
Or maybe I'm not gossiping.

246
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,167
I knew it.

247
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:19,768
- I am glad you called.
- Me too.

248
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,739
- This is a beautiful home.
- Well, thank you.

249
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,226
It's not at all what I was expecting.

250
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,602
Really? So, what were you expecting?

251
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:32,978
Modern American government salary.

252
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:34,002
Oh.

253
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,276
Did you come from money?

254
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,221
You know, I really love
the way that you just...

255
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:45,847
say anything that comes into your mind.

256
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,523
- I don't know any other way.
- Okay.

257
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:54,345
Well, yes. I inherited
a lot of money. Yes.

258
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,474
Since we began dating,

259
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:58,101
I've been reading a lot
about the history of the CIA.

260
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:02,143
How they would recruit
people from elite families.

261
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,143
Are we dating?

262
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:09,542
- Would you like us to be dating?
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

263
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:23,185
- What... what are you doing?
- Rico. Huh?

264
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,297
- Who is Rico?
- Rico.

265
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:27,519
Uh, I have no idea
who you're talking about.

266
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:30,894
The bartender from our
honeymoon. C'mon. Rico.

267
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:34,123
Oh, come on! You're so making this up!

268
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:37,550
Y'know, I don't like to be too
critical of your bad memory because...

269
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,189
it's one of my favorite
things about you...

270
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:40,435
It serves me so well.

271
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:43,240
- But it's a little worrisome at times.
- Fuck you.

272
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:47,841
He tended the bar at that
shack on the beach.

273
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:50,544
There's a photo of him
in our wedding album.

274
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:52,234
Oh, pl... Now, I know you're lying.

275
00:21:52,258 --> 00:21:54,459
- Okay, where is the wedding album?
- I've no idea.

276
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:57,244
What, now you have no idea
where our wedding album is?

277
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:00,103
That thing should be in
a climate-controlled vault

278
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:02,101
with a state-of-the-art alarm system.

279
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,444
It is. But the location is unknown.

280
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:06,468
Even to us.

281
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,113
- Rico! Okay.
- Oh, my God.

282
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:11,602
All right, all right. Enough.

283
00:22:11,626 --> 00:22:15,560
Maybe you were on your
honeymoon with your other wife.

284
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,572
There's only ever been you, babe.

285
00:22:18,596 --> 00:22:19,575
Aww...

286
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,854
Yeah. Try this on.

287
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:25,078
Mmm.

288
00:22:28,393 --> 00:22:31,727
- It's true, you know.
- What is?

289
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,805
There's only ever been you.

290
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:37,584
I know.

291
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,249
Gee, thanks.

292
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:46,167
You already know I
feel the exact same way.

293
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,996
Thank you for staying home with me

294
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,910
for no good reason
than that I asked you to.

295
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,449
You also know that I cannot
say no to you, Gordon.

296
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:57,834
Well, cheers to that.

297
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:04,376
I just wish I knew what
we were celebrating.

298
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:10,351
Everything. All of it.

299
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,581
We were so young when we got married.

300
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:15,018
You know what a colossal fucking
mistake that could have been?

301
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:17,477
Uh, yeah, my mother
certainly made the case.

302
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,852
But your mother was wrong.
It was the exact right thing to do.

303
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:23,310
Somehow we both knew it.

304
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,037
Somewhere deep inside where...

305
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:28,417
you know things before you know them.

306
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,810
I have so many regrets

307
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:38,459
but none of them are on the same
continent as you and the kids.

308
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:45,918
- I'm sorry. I better shut up.
- No no.

309
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:50,065
Come here.

310
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:52,922
I love you so much.

311
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:03,167
I'll do something just for you, baby.

312
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,927
- I have to head out for a couple of hours.
- Okay.

313
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:24,393
Keep an eye on Encyclopedia Brown.

314
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:27,834
Make sure he doesn't eat
your Pad Thai leftovers.

315
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:55,768
- Dance with me.
- No, I have... I have two left feet.

316
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,409
I don't believe that for a second.

317
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:58,703
Come on. This way we can

318
00:24:58,727 --> 00:25:01,079
break the ice instead of
going straight to kissing.

319
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,903
Can I put my hand this way?

320
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:15,607
- That's good.
- Thank you.

321
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:47,337
What is that?

322
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:49,262
I think it was...

323
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:59,000
- Shall we go see?
- Mm-hmm.

324
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,161
It's a songbird.

325
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,643
He's confused. He thinks he's outside.

326
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:06,717
What do we do?

327
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,477
Aww...

328
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:11,940
Is it dead?

329
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:13,164
Ah...

330
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:27,813
Oh.

331
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:33,310
I'm hungry.

332
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,341
How do you feed yourself?

333
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:37,901
I'm pretty handy with a microwave.

334
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:39,347
We're going to the supermarket.

335
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:41,971
I'm making you lunch. And maybe dinner.

336
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,665
The reason rumors have persisted

337
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:47,143
about the near-plague
epidemic of 2018...

338
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,869
is the Special Commission's report

339
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:52,310
exonerating the CIA
was... well... unconvincing.

340
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:54,086
We are expected to believe that

341
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,643
nobody above middle management
was involved in this thing.

342
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:59,685
Not to mention anyone lucky
enough to still be alive.

343
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,135
Shall we examine the body count?

344
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,239
Elden Loramer, CIA. Dead.

345
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:07,254
His wife Iris. Dead.

346
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,727
Sam Barber, CIA. Dead.

347
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:13,477
Marty Frost, retired CIA. Dead.

348
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:16,643
Gareth Minor, White Sands CEO. Dead.

349
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,810
Caleb Wolfe, Information activist. Dead.

350
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:24,584
And let's not forget the 11 dead
CIA analysts in Georgetown.

351
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,459
Oh, my God!

352
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:03,660
Oh, Azucena!

353
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:06,018
Oh! Oh, you scared the shit out of me!

354
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:09,560
Sorry to scare you. I am so sorry.
I didn't think you were home.

355
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:14,393
No, no, no. It's my fault.
It's Thursday. I'm sorry.

356
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:17,431
Oh, I think I just need
to get out of the house.

357
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:19,643
I was feeling all cooped-up.

358
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:24,209
- You're out of detergent.
- Okay. I'll get some.

359
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,876
Thanks.

360
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,495
Are you hungry?

361
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:35,682
Huh? Uh... yeah.

362
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:44,101
Well, we use reflective surfaces.
Windows, puddles, cars.

363
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,852
It's the part of the brain
that never stops working.

364
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:49,485
It is always uneasy,
searching, scanning.

365
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:52,143
When I was a young man
it was drilled into me

366
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:56,727
that if I lowered my defenses,
I might die... or worse.

367
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:58,612
It's what we call "tradecraft".

368
00:29:58,636 --> 00:29:59,727
Oh.

369
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:03,180
So... so, when you're driving...

370
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:06,663
are you checking to see if
you're being... what's the word?

371
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:08,059
Tailed?

372
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:10,560
If I'm driving or walking... mm-hmm.

373
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:12,784
And have you ever spotted a tail?

374
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:14,748
Mmm... not in decades.

375
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:18,658
But you have spotted them? These tails?

376
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:21,375
Yes, many times. Mm-hmm.

377
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:27,317
- Are you just trying to turn me on?
- Is it working?

378
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,751
I hope so.

379
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:34,053
I want to believe that
Gordon is innocent, but...

380
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:36,950
it's getting really difficult.

381
00:30:36,974 --> 00:30:38,716
I've been where you are.

382
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,451
Facing a possibility that a...
good friend is a traitor.

383
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,438
You know someone as
long as I've known Gordon

384
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:48,567
you can believe what your eyes
see, trust your own judgment.

385
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:51,126
Which is not always easy,

386
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,755
when you feel like
you've missed something

387
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:54,544
sitting right in front of you.

388
00:30:55,834 --> 00:31:00,209
- Are you talking about Sam Barber?
- Yeah.

389
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:05,531
- You two were close, huh?
- Yeah, he was my best friend.

390
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:12,826
Is it weird for you that I'm dating Mae?

391
00:31:14,751 --> 00:31:19,560
No. No, I'm happy for you both.

392
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:24,375
She needed to get over Sam...

393
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:28,834
and you're good for each other.

394
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:33,995
Do me a favor and tell her that, huh?

395
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,477
It's Eva. You know what to do.

396
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,100
Hey, it's Mae.

397
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:44,163
I thought about your offer
and I don't want to pursue it.

398
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:46,115
I need to try and get past this.

399
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,869
I think talking to Senator Thrush

400
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:52,059
would just reopen old
wounds at this point, but...

401
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:57,709
Thanks anyway.
I really appreciate it. Bye.

402
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:49,226
It's Eva. You know what to do.

403
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,709
It's me again. Forget my last message.

404
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:28,221
Ready?

405
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,909
- The ambulance.
- What ambulance?

406
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:35,083
- How'd they get it?
- How'd who get it?

407
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,286
You need to set up a database..

408
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,104
Stolen ambulances and
ambulance rentals in DC,

409
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:45,970
Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia and the Carolinas.

410
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:50,584
Do it now.

411
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:55,760
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. It's just a headache.

412
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,456
When was the last time
you got some sleep?

413
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,518
It's been a while. I could probably
do with a nap, but I'm fine.

414
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:03,561
I'll drop you off at Mae's.

415
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:04,564
- You can get some rest.
- Oh, no, no, no.

416
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:06,588
I'll call you if we get a hit. Come on.

417
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:51,501
I'm going home.

418
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,834
Where are you trying to sneak in?

419
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:18,745
I'm going home to sleep.

420
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:23,185
Someone was watching me yesterday.

421
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:27,268
- Do you want to keep me company?
- I have a meeting.

422
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:31,852
- It's your loss.
- Maybe I'll come later.

423
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:34,918
Maybe I'll already be asleep.

424
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,727
I can't do this anymore.

425
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:17,275
I don't feel safe. I can't sleep
at night. I feel like they know.

426
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:19,909
You are safe. Not even my own
people know who you are.

427
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,844
It's not your people that
I'm worried about.

428
00:36:21,868 --> 00:36:24,572
Please.

429
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:26,935
Surely I have repaid
my debt to you by now.

430
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:30,602
- We can cool it off for a couple of weeks.
- No, I can't...

431
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:34,292
I didn't put you in
this situation, Polina.

432
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:39,894
I'm scared.

433
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:44,109
Here. You look cold.
This'll warm you up.

434
00:36:50,998 --> 00:36:53,831
Now tell me... do you know who this is?

435
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:14,489
The guy who made the pay-off
to Piper was Lior Lishkott.

436
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:15,535
He's ex-Mossad.

437
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:18,400
He has his own private security
company in Tyson's Corner.

438
00:37:18,424 --> 00:37:20,585
Okay. Maybe Gordon's
going to work for him

439
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:22,351
in the private sector
and that was just...

440
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,263
advancing him some cash.

441
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:27,065
The Israelis couldn't prove
it, but they suspected

442
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:29,477
that Lishkott was doubling for the SVR.

443
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:32,375
So they shot Candon for it.

444
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:38,059
- I got a warrant and the FBI wants...
- Wait.

445
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,192
C'mon, Tracy.

446
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,056
Gordon took money from a
Russian intelligence agent.

447
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,599
- No more waiting.
- I agree.

448
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:49,831
Can you do me a favor?

449
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,518
There you go, babe. See?

450
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:58,477
- Who's that?
- That, son, is Rico.

451
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:00,083
That is so weird,

452
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:03,661
seeing yourself in a photograph
you do not remember taking.

453
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:06,125
Pizza's here.

454
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,935
Hey. This is a surprise. Come on in.

455
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:18,641
- I'm here for work.
- What does that mean?

456
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:21,048
I asked them to let me be the
one to come and get you.

457
00:38:22,211 --> 00:38:23,310
You asked who?

458
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,811
I thought it would be less
invasive, less embarrassing.

459
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:30,043
- Tracy, what the fuck are you talking about?
- Lior Lishkott.

460
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,737
- What about him?
- You took money from him.

461
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:39,810
- I can explain that.
- Yeah, you'll get a chance to.

462
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,794
- He offered me a job.
- You have a job.

463
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:44,459
At least you had one.

464
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:50,292
- Are you fucking serious?
- You think I'd joke about this?

465
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:03,792
Oh, yeah, that was
in the winter, last...

466
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:08,042
- When we went to go hiking.
- You've got your dad's eyes.

467
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:15,059
I have to go. It's work.

468
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:20,018
I'll see you... I'm not sure...

469
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:21,518
- Gordon?
- Yup.

470
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:26,334
Gordon. What is going on?

471
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:32,878
They want to ask me some questions.

472
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:35,938
Who wants to ask you some questions?

473
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,542
About the money.

474
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:44,705
Tracy, what is going on?

475
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:47,059
Don't ask him. He's
not here as a friend.

476
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:51,375
Come here. Look, it's gonna be okay.

477
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,444
What did you do, Gordon?

478
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:58,351
Gordon, what the fuck did you do?

479
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,751
- Don't fucking touch me, man.
- Tracy, what...

480
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,770
I didn't do this. You
did this to yourself.

481
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,058
Fuck you!

482
00:40:30,015 --> 00:40:32,015
You did that to yourself, too.

483
00:41:16,332 --> 00:41:18,333
We're here.

484
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,499
What the hell happened to you
earlier? I waited an hour.

485
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:53,643
I was followed.

486
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:57,059
- By whom?
- The Americans.

487
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:01,351
They were at the marina when I
met with Piper. What's going on?

488
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:03,435
- Did you lose them?
- Eventually.

489
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:07,648
- Did you use me to set Piper up?
- Yes.

490
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:08,726
Why didn't you tell me?

491
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:12,206
It wasn't of operational
significance for you to know.

492
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:16,944
You are going to have to
go away for a while.

493
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:17,976
Fuck.

494
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,696
The Americans will be looking for you.

495
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,453
What am I supposed to tell my wife?

496
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,876
Hey, how long do I have to go away for?

497
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,643
I was trying to get in
touch with you, man.

498
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:14,891
Sorry. I couldn't get away until now.

499
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:16,310
Is it safe to talk?

500
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:19,560
Yeah. We're alone.

501
00:43:19,584 --> 00:43:21,602
- Is your arm okay?
- Yeah, I'm gonna live.

502
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:23,069
Two of my guys didn't make it.

503
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:24,827
You know that? They have families.

504
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:26,993
They'll be taken care of.
There's an Agency slush fund.

505
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:29,727
That was a very dirty job,
even for the Agency.

506
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:32,225
We need to stay focused and
just wipe everything down.

507
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:33,825
Yeah.

508
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:36,005
- Where did you get the ambulance?
- Rented it.

509
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:39,477
- You rented it?
- I told them we were making a movie.

510
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:42,305
- Did you use your real name?
- You said to go fast.

511
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,602
It was too fast. I told you that.

512
00:43:44,626 --> 00:43:46,829
And that boy of yours,
he had real skills.

513
00:43:46,853 --> 00:43:49,143
You said it was an easy job.
That was not an easy job.

514
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:53,145
- I got bad intel.
- Who the fuck was that guy?

515
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:55,585
Russian intelligence officer.

516
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:02,976
- Your friend. The one who's alive.
- Yeah, let's see him.

517
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,368
Do you trust him?

518
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,685
Is he gonna tell anyone my name?

519
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:10,250
He doesn't know your name.

520
00:44:11,531 --> 00:44:13,500
Where's the burner we've been using?

521
00:44:14,892 --> 00:44:16,892
Hold on.

522
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:24,411
The agency better fucking
take care of their...
