1
00:00:00,518 --> 00:00:01,992
Previously on "Condor"...

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,801
- Is he okay? Shit.
- Does he look okay?

3
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:07,603
There may still be a problem.

4
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:09,657
- Who? I'll handle it.
- Joe Turner.

5
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,323
No. If it needs to be done, I'll do it.

6
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:13,397
- It's Tracy. Leave a message.
- I found the ambulance.

7
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:15,159
I got the guy's address.
I'm on my way there.

8
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,476
- What the fuck you doing here?
- I can explain!

9
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:19,579
Because of the Russians? Are
you guys working together?

10
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,739
- He is dead.
- We didn't kill him.

11
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,145
- We were going to make a hand-off.
- With who? The Russians?

12
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:26,181
The Russians? We were
working for the CIA!

13
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:30,360
Him and his crew were
contracted to kill Sirin.

14
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:32,392
Not kill, kidnap. And he got away.

15
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:34,018
- So, Sirin's alive?
- I think so.

16
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:37,894
How many blown ops have
you been a part of recently?

17
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:41,212
I'm impressed. Your little speech
brought Mr. Crane to tears.

18
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:42,808
Tracy's too close to the case.

19
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,991
He tried to persuade me that
Gordon was being set up

20
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:47,324
by the Russians to protect
the real infiltrator.

21
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:49,566
- You and I should go away together.
- When?

22
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:50,982
Right now.

23
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,995
- I'm thinking about getting out.
- Moscow may not allow it.

24
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:55,297
Is that a threat?

25
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,039
The Russians are cleaning
up after themselves.

26
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,042
Cleaning up what?

27
00:00:58,044 --> 00:00:59,953
They set up Gordon to protect
their actual inside man.

28
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:01,954
This whole fucking thing has
been one big active measure.

29
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:04,468
Oh, if Sirin's alive, maybe he
can tell you who the mole is.

30
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,008
Too bad you didn't pick a place to meet,

31
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,171
in the event things
didn't go as planned.

32
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:11,108
Joe? My name is Ekaterina.

33
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,310
We have a friend in common.

34

36
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:04,472
Hurry up, it's freezing cold!

37
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:11,922
Here.

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,570
- For the fire.
- You are a genius!

39
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:24,153
Are you thirsty?

40
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:27,114
- To your good health.
- To your promotion.

41
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,071
I was afraid you'd be jealous.

42
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:38,238
You were hoping to get
the job yourself, right?

43
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:42,445
It had crossed my mind.

44
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,237
But I'm happy for you.

45
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:50,212
You know I'll always take care of you.

46
00:02:56,405 --> 00:03:01,112
Then we'll also drink
to your good health.

47
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,697
You're a good friend, Vasili.

48
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:15,657
I checked. There's no Dale
Fridrych working for the CIMC.

49
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,518
The Russians are cleaning
up after themselves.

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,403
Cleaning up what?

51
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:22,364
Gordon was set up to protect
their actual inside man.

52
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,369
This whole fucking thing's
been one big active measure.

53
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,364
If this is a disinformation campaign,

54
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:29,339
you and Mrs. Larkin really
stepped into it, didn't you?

55
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:30,817
No?

56
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,531
What are you going to do now? Hmm?

57
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:36,078
Oh, if Sirin's alive
and you can find him,

58
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,280
maybe he can tell you who the mole is.

59
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:41,049
Too bad you didn't pick a place to meet,

60
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,278
in the event things
didn't go as planned.

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,661
Tradecraft? 101.

62
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:49,195
I'm not the only one who's
made an obvious mistake.

63
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:52,254
Maybe you have a reason to
hang Gordon Piper out to dry.

64
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:55,656
Good night.

65
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,408
This is a boarding call for train...

66
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:36,578
Joe?

67
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,062
My name is Ekaterina. My
American friends call me Kat.

68
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:42,007
We have a friend in common.

69
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,679
- Where's Vasili?
- He sent me.

70
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:47,009
Keep moving so we don't
draw attention to ourselves.

71
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:55,519
And who are you?

72
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:57,945
Somebody who prefers to be
kept out of your Agency reports.

73
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:00,112
I don't work for the Agency.

74
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:03,333
Uh-huh. I'm going to
get back on this train

75
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,370
by the time it leaves the station.

76
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:05,822
I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

77
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,181
You're not going to take me to Vasili?

78
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:09,494
I'm taking you to the end of
track 11. You can take yourself.

79
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,737
He's your problem now.

80
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:12,799
It was great to see you, Joe.

81
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:16,320
80 Bowery Street, Chevy
Chase and Maryland.

82
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:18,364
Take care of him.

83
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:22,368
Hey!

84
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,781
Hey, asshole!

85
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,185
Hey. What the hell?

86
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:54,900
_

87
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,008
Hello.

88
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,747
- Where are you?
- Almost home.

89
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,326
Never mind, I see you.

90
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:45,069
Jump in.

91
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:12,822
Where are we going?

92
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:15,906
You can navigate.

93
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:21,947
Who are we following?

94
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:29,403
When we bumped into each
other earlier outside the deli...

95
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:32,906
you said you were going home to sleep.

96
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:37,403
I decided to take a walk.

97
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:39,403
Alone?

98
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:43,614
Is this an interrogation? Yes, alone.

99
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:49,656
Just when I start liking you, you
start behaving like an asshole.

100
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,989
We're following Joe Turner.

101
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,020
Who's he?

102
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:59,195
He helped Vasili come
to the United States.

103
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:02,489
- Does he work for the CIA?
- It's unclear.

104
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:12,987
- How long have you been following him?
- Since late this afternoon.

105
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:15,112
Where did he go?

106
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:19,112
To a meeting at Union Station.

107
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:22,572
- With whom?
- I didn't see.

108
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:29,362
I have a feeling he's meeting Sirin.

109
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:33,071
He'll lead us straight to him.

110
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:34,987
Why did you call me?

111
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:40,487
Turner was close to your
home. I needed assistance.

112
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:44,320
You could have called the office.
They would have sent a team.

113
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:48,153
Yes, I could have done that.

114
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:52,528
But you like the idea of me
chasing my ex-boyfriend?

115
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,654
I simply prefer your company.

116
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:59,445
I want to get to know you even better.

117
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:04,820
You can never really
know people's motives.

118
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:08,614
You just have to decide
which ones to trust.

119
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:17,656
Turn right up ahead.

120
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:34,320
I feel like a teenager
sneaking out of the house.

121
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:35,992
I guarantee you,

122
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:39,278
no teenager ever left
their mother a 'to do' list.

123
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,630
When I was 13 I ran away from home,

124
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:43,684
and I left a list for my mom,

125
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,746
telling her when to
feed my various pets.

126
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,762
How many pets are we talking about here?

127
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:52,119
A rabbit, a parakeet and an aquarium.

128
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:54,513
I was a very responsible teenager.

129
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:55,897
That's a lot of pets!

130
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:59,656
Yeah, I wanted to be a veterinarian.

131
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:04,314
Well, how come you decided to
become a people doctor instead?

132
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:11,029
It's harder to see animals
in pain than it is people.

133
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:14,153
That's cold!

134
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:16,737
It's true.

135
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,541
Uh, you sure the kids are okay

136
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:21,195
with you and me going away together?

137
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:23,361
They really like you.

138
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:25,528
And they love spending
time with their Grandma.

139
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,959
Hey wait! Stop, stop!

140
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:35,812
What are husbands for if
not to take the trash out?

141
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,820
Uh, Gordon's not here.

142
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:41,517
Yeah. Let me help you out.

143
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,830
He had a work thing.

144
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,521
- Hey.
- Hey.

145
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:47,982
- I spoke to Senator Thrush today.
- Oh, really?

146
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:51,078
Yeah. You know, it felt
really good to talk to her.

147
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,654
Thanks for the push.

148
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:55,740
Of course, of course.
Where are you two off to?

149
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,437
He won't tell me. It's a surprise.

150
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:02,987
Ooh, that's nice. Tracy's
so good at surprises.

151
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:06,038
All right, you're all set.
We should get going.

152
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,889
- See you later.
- Yeah, see you soon.

153
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:11,570
I should tell her the kind of
friend you really are, shouldn't I?

154
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:15,340
- Bye! Have fun, you two.
- Bye! Thank you.

155
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:51,411
At first I imagined it would
be like this all the time.

156
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,371
But it's mostly paperwork.

157
00:13:55,155 --> 00:14:01,195
What delusions did you have
when you decided to do this?

158
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:03,987
Why are you asking?

159
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:05,588
Excuse me,

160
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,362
but didn't you just say you
wanted to get to know me better?

161
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:13,280
That requires asking
questions and answering them.

162
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:19,320
My father worked like yours
in the intelligence service.

163
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:22,697
- Have you read about me?
- I know everything about you.

164
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:28,906
I met your father once.
He was a great man.

165
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:39,236
He was a drunk who beat up
his wife and three daughters.

166
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:43,739
You do not know everything. You
only know what you have read.

167
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:08,123
- What are you thinking about?
- Hmm?

168
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,934
Seemed like you went
somewhere there for a second.

169
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:15,158
Uh, I'm back now.

170
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,138
I had a good chat with your
mom while you were packing.

171
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,967
Oh, God! What did she say?

172
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:23,687
She asked me, if I was true blue.

173
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:31,476
Oh, I'm sorry. What did you say?

174
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:34,570
I said I was where you were concerned.

175
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:37,001
That's so embarrassing.

176
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,772
I get it. Come on. Her daughter's
going off for the weekend

177
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:41,319
with some guy she doesn't know...

178
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:42,921
I'd be nervous, too.

179
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,223
You know, I'm a little
bit nervous myself.

180
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:51,118
Really? Why's that?

181
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:54,790
Well, for starters, I have no
idea where you're taking me.

182
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:58,288
Oh yeah? Does it scare you
not knowing where you're going?

183
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,219
A little.

184
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:03,891
Does it turn you on to be in control?

185
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,400
Do you get off on that?

186
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:10,862
I, uh...

187
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:15,888
I... like that you trust
me to be in control.

188
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,278
I get off on that.

189
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,653
Maybe you just like having secrets.

190
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:25,612
No, no. I'm done with secrets.
That's why we're going on here.

191
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:27,994
You're really building
up the suspense here.

192
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:30,771
You're going to love it. Trust me.

193
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:32,177
Well, you know, I should call Joe

194
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:34,862
and let him know that
we're going out of town.

195
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:36,872
Yeah, yeah. Go for it.

196
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,889
- Hey.
- How's it going?

197
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:46,436
It's going. How about you?

198
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:49,694
Tracy and I are on our way
out of town for a few days.

199
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,678
Oh, you guys are leaving
town? Where you going?

200
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,751
It's a surprise. But it's
just for a couple of days.

201
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:57,577
And my mom is going
to stay with the boys.

202
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,045
I just wanted you to know.

203
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:00,620
Thanks.

204
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:03,396
I'm on my way to see a friend
of mine, visiting from Europe.

205
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,138
He's actually a mutual
friend of mine and Tracy's.

206
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,700
You guys have a friend in common?

207
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:12,241
Tell Tracy that Basil is in town.

208
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:15,187
Joe wants me to tell
you that Basil's in town.

209
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:19,142
- Basil? How is he?
- Here, you're on speaker.

210
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,852
Hey, I heard that Basil
had a little accident.

211
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:26,315
Yeah, he had a close
call, but he's okay.

212
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:27,918
Well, please tell Basil I said, "Hi",

213
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,171
and that I'd love to talk to him
if he's feeling up to it.

214
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,929
I'll tell him that's what you said.

215
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,718
Hey, you're really stepping
on my surprise vacation here.

216
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,989
- Sorry. Bye.
- Bye, Joe.

217
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:47,566
Do you guys really have a friend
in common or was that about work?

218
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:52,572
You know what? Never mind.
I... I don't want to know.

219
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,815
You know what?
I'm just going to pull over,

220
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:08,114
find a bathroom real quick.

221
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:09,116
Okay.

222
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,695
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

223
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:43,612
I think Joe Turner's on his
way to meet Vasili Sirin.

224
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:47,703
- I'm already on him.
- Okay. Good.

225
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:50,705
All right. I gotta go. Happy hunting.

226
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:55,947
Was that your source in the CIA?

227
00:18:57,864 --> 00:19:00,112
Yes.

228
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:04,153
He must be good if he already
knows where Joe Turner is going.

229
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:07,112
He is our most valuable asset.

230
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:12,073
I would do basically
anything to protect him.

231
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,668
- What was that for?
- Luck.

232
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:13,443
Why did you change your mind?

233
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,577
I've been where you are.

234
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,947
Stop, stop!

235
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:39,737
Wake up! Wake up! Oh, shit!

236
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,445
Wake up, Kathy! God, damn it, wake up!

237
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:46,254
Please, wake up! Please, wake up!

238
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:48,256
Please, wake up!

239
00:20:56,842 --> 00:21:00,339
We're just taking a little detour.

240
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:02,320
- Detour?
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:21:02,322 --> 00:21:04,031
I want to show you something.

242
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:27,183
Here. You might wanna...

243
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,788
wrap yourself up in this.
It's a little cold out here.

244
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,954
Oh. Thank you.

245
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,864
What's in the box?

246
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:47,364
The secret is you're a nerd?

247
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,403
Right. Take a look.

248
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:22,530
- What star is that?
- That... is my star.

249
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,340
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

250
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:31,864
I spent $33 online and it's all mine.

251
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,073
So, you have a star.

252
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:09,031
Vasili means nothing to me.

253
00:23:10,073 --> 00:23:12,487
Maybe not.

254
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:17,238
You never know why
people do what they do.

255
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:24,031
Is this a test of which
of my lovers I am loyal to?

256
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,734
He's turning right.

257
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,439
He's stopped.

258
00:25:14,153 --> 00:25:18,029
Make a sound and I'll slit your throat.

259
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:21,530
- How many are you?
- Just me.

260
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,419
My friend!

261
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:28,781
- She found you.
- Yes.

262
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:03,962
- Where the fuck did they come from?
- They followed you.

263
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:06,098
Yeah? Or maybe she betrayed you.

264
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,544
No, she already knew where I was.

265
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:11,113
- She helped me at great personal risk.
- Uh-huh.

266
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:14,724
We should get rid of this car.
There might be a tracker on it.

267
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:15,926
- Okay.
- Yeah.

268
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,893
You had him in sight.

269
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:21,904
In that case, he would
have been dead now.

270
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:23,943
- What about you and Vasili?
- He's a traitor.

271
00:26:23,945 --> 00:26:25,210
No, he's not.

272
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:28,572
This is personal.

273
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:55,278
When we were young, I
was always jealous of you.

274
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,779
You had natural skill,
never had to work hard.

275
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:07,705
- I had a hard time learning.
- You struggled really hard.

276
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:14,279
I had some luck too.

277
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:17,081
You deserve everything
that came your way.

278
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:24,041
If I were you... I would have
said exactly the same thing.

279
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:29,639
But I wonder whose ass you
had to lick to end up my boss?

280
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:33,195
I didn't, I promise.

281
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:37,362
I've been thinking for a long
time about saying one thing to you.

282
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:42,364
I've always known you're
the smartest of us.

283
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:48,538
Of course, you realize
that in our business,

284
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,320
none of us know the details

285
00:27:50,322 --> 00:27:53,904
of what the other has achieved
in his professional life.

286
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:58,474
- I don't need details.
- But I want to tell you.

287
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:03,862
I want my closest friend
to know why I'm where I am.

288
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:08,324
Okay, whose ass did you lick?

289
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:15,844
For the past twelve years
I've had a mole in the CIA.

290
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:34,280
Tell me... how you managed it.

291
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:42,862
There is only one way to
reel in such a large fish.

292
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:47,487
You have to catch it when
it is small and cultivate it.

293
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:53,489
I threw bait at CIA offices all
over Europe for several years...

294
00:28:54,781 --> 00:29:00,153
... while waiting for the right fish...

295
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,114
... to swim past.

296
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:23,737
His name is Volk.

297
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:28,528
- Who is he?
- An old friend... from home.

298
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:33,208
We came up in the SVR together
and we were like brothers.

299
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:39,374
I used him in a moment of
weakness... drunkenness, really.

300
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:43,820
He bragged to me about an
asset he was running in the CIA.

301
00:29:43,822 --> 00:29:47,524
I betrayed his trust and used his secret

302
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:50,029
as leverage to earn my freedom.

303
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:52,489
And, now he wants to kill me.

304
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:55,739
Who is the mole?

305
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,249
That's still the only
leverage I have left.

306
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:03,396
I think I've put my neck on the
line far enough for you by now

307
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:04,411
to have earned your trust.

308
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:05,873
This is not a matter of trust.

309
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:08,983
This is a matter of survival.

310
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:16,691
This is a good place. Pull over.

311
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:27,874
When I was a kid... I saw
a meteor in the night sky.

312
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:33,562
So, I calculated its arc
and went searching for it.

313
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:37,593
I was completely obsessed
with finding this rock.

314
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:40,132
It was totally irrational.

315
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:44,150
And I think I have been
preoccupied my whole adult life

316
00:30:44,152 --> 00:30:48,195
with some version of
that same obsession.

317
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:51,541
Trying to enact some sort of mastery

318
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:54,530
over the vast, unknowable universe.

319
00:30:57,337 --> 00:30:59,695
It's a weakness. It's...

320
00:30:59,697 --> 00:31:04,280
... the drive of ego,
the urge for power...

321
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:09,991
For 20 years, I've been keeping secrets

322
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,926
from the people that
I care about the most.

323
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:14,497
Doing things that I'm not proud of.

324
00:31:15,947 --> 00:31:19,029
Been caught up in this...

325
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:21,280
... stupid game.

326
00:31:23,954 --> 00:31:26,243
I don't want to do that any more.

327
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:31,166
I want to retire.

328
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:38,822
And for years I...

329
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:43,906
couldn't even see how that would
be possible, going out with you.

330
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:47,739
When we are together...

331
00:31:49,496 --> 00:31:52,502
... I can finally this clear
path to our own little...

332
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:57,127
... private piece of
happiness in the world.

333
00:32:25,197 --> 00:32:26,656
Keys.

334
00:32:42,704 --> 00:32:46,487
- Can I help you gentlemen?
- Hey... um...

335
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:49,008
Our car just broke down a
couple of miles up the road,

336
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,668
and we were just...

337
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:54,906
We will comply.

338
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:59,089
Are you a couple of dope addicts?

339
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:02,028
No, no, we're with the government.

340
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,280
Oh, well then, I trust you implicitly.

341
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:08,695
Easy, easy.

342
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:13,112
- Are they on opioids?
- I don't know. Hard to tell.

343
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:18,656
- What are you two doing in our barn?
- We, uh... we need your car.

344
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:23,978
- The cops are on their way.
- Get comfortable.

345
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,587
Great. In fact, yeah.

346
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:32,155
We will just stand here
until the cops arrive.

347
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:50,637
May I have a glass of water?

348
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,401
You got balls, son, I'll give you that.

349
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:57,083
What are you, Russian?

350
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,412
- The cops are here.
- I just called 'em.

351
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:17,521
Shit!

352
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:20,090
Maybe a unit was already nearby.

353
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:22,009
Way the hell out here?

354
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:24,840
The tracker wasn't on your car.

355
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:26,403
- It's on you.
- Shit!

356
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:28,655
- Hold still.
- What?

357
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,644
- Stay on the fucking ground!
- I work for a federal agency!

358
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:34,341
My name is Joe Turner.

359
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:39,119
Are you really with the government?

360
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:40,347
And I promise you,

361
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:42,666
you do not want us here
when these people arrive.

362
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:44,106
You will be witnesses.

363
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:49,528
- Please!
- It's that way...

364
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,822
Thank you.

365
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:03,308
Did you miss the sign out front?

366
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,385
The one that reads "Private property"?

367
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:09,114
- Put your guns on the ground!
- It's okay.

368
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:15,728
I'm Special Agent Dale
Fridrych. I'm with the FBI.

369
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,113
Is it all right if I reach
for my credentials?

370
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,528
Slower.

371
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:29,545
Right, just give 'em a toss.

372
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:41,543
We're looking for two
very dangerous men.

373
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,025
I caught them in our barn.
I told 'em to fuck off.

374
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:51,579
Did you happen to see
which way they fucked off to?

375
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,195
Come on. It's okay.

376
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:45,890
- I can't...
- Go on...

377
00:36:45,892 --> 00:36:47,654
I don't think so.

378
00:36:47,656 --> 00:36:51,655
I would tell you to go on without me.

379
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,326
But please, do not.

380
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,857
When we first got here, you asked me...

381
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:09,445
what my plans were for the future.

382
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:12,171
Yeah, you said you wanted
to meet a woman

383
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:14,391
and start a small business.

384
00:37:14,393 --> 00:37:16,131
I already knew the woman.

385
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:19,398
It's the woman who
met me at the station.

386
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,869
Yeah.

387
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:29,612
I imagined us running away
together and making a life together.

388
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:33,838
But she says she no longer loves me.

389
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,822
I'm sorry.

390
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:41,656
I think she still loves me.

391
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:45,114
But she's afraid.

392
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:49,405
Good. Use that.

393
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:53,489
It'll give you something to fight for.

394
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:32,280
The forest is too big.
We need reinforcement.

395
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:49,628
- Ow! Poor crabs!
- Poor crabs? It's delicious crabs.

396
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:55,251
- Have you ever heard of "crab mentality"?
- Uh, nope.

397
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:56,751
What?

398
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:58,569
You catch a bunch of crabs
and put 'em in a bucket.

399
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:01,903
They will sabotage each
other's attempts to escape.

400
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,427
- Why?
- They're like,

401
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:05,872
"Fuck you, if I'm stuck here,
so are you".

402
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:06,875
Okay.

403
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,819
They just can't see that if
they all just stopped competing,

404
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:11,710
they would all eventually get out.

405
00:39:11,712 --> 00:39:13,600
So that's why we should eat them?

406
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,103
'Cause they're "shellfish"?

407
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:22,330
Mm-hmm.

408
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:24,696
I beat you at your own game here.

409
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:25,904
Mm-hmm.

410
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:30,204
No, we eat... we eat them
because they're delicious,

411
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:33,455
and we all feel bad because
they're little assholes.

412
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:36,031
- Nice to see you, Tracy.
- Hey, Pete. How are you?

413
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,379
You come here a lot?

414
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:45,580
- I have a little hideout in the area.
- Oh.

415
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:47,629
- You have a hideout?
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:39:48,564 --> 00:39:53,065
Does that make you a
superhero? Or a supervillain?

417
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:55,449
It depends on whose version
of the story you believe.

418
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,983
Am I going to get to see this hideout?

419
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:09,486
Where did you get your
hideout, huh? Airbnb?

420
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:16,262
Uh, no. Actually this is my house.

421
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:18,246
What?

422
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:19,841
Really?

423
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:23,906
It's beautiful!

424
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:27,327
Wait till you see the
view in the morning.

425
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:30,536
How many times have you used that one?

426
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:33,650
Never.

427
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:37,634
Come on.

428
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:41,026
You're the only person
I've ever brought up here.

429
00:40:41,028 --> 00:40:43,760
Not even Anders.

430
00:40:43,762 --> 00:40:46,656
Until now this place
has just been for me.

431
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,259
You're sharing your secrets.

432
00:40:56,532 --> 00:40:58,345
Are there more?

433
00:41:28,335 --> 00:41:29,569
No.

434
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:32,522
I need to rest.

435
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:47,998
I need you to tell me who the mole is.

436
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:53,012
I think an innocent man is
going to take the fall for him

437
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:54,847
which is at least partly my fault.

438
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:58,716
But if you tell me who it is,
then I can clear his name.

439
00:42:01,816 --> 00:42:04,613
I would like to tell
you who the mole is.

440
00:42:06,277 --> 00:42:07,637
But I don't know.

441
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,662
I bluffed.

442
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:15,405
It was the only way to save my own life.

443
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:20,047
No. Volk is hunting you,

444
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:22,143
because he told you
the name of his asset.

445
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:26,684
No. He's hunting me because
he knows he said too much.

446
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:30,115
But he was so drunk, he doesn't remember

447
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:33,124
exactly what it is he said to me.

448
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:40,199
You lied to me.

449
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:42,215
There really is a mole, Joe.

450
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:44,682
And he really did kill your uncle.

451
00:42:44,684 --> 00:42:49,713
I wasn't interested in avenging
the death of my uncle,

452
00:42:49,715 --> 00:42:53,663
until you came to me
and asked for my help!

453
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:57,751
I am only fucking here,
because you used me!

454
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:01,528
I'm sorry, Joe.

455
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:20,434
We should go. The
hunters will be here soon.
