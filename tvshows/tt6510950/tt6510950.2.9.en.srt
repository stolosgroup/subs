1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,701
Previously on Condor...

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,195
You're not going to break me.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,431
Challenge accepted...

4
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:08,210
It's about CHS Phoenix.
He's sent up an SOS.

5
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:10,281
My people are on to me.
I'm being watched.

6
00:00:10,383 --> 00:00:11,367
Requesting asylum...

7
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:13,453
Breathe! Breathe!

8
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:16,710
She was working for the CIA!

9
00:00:17,507 --> 00:00:20,757
Senator Thrush is pursuing an
obstruction of justice charge against you.

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,702
Someone gave a sealed deposition.

11
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:24,549
Hello?
- We're going to war.

12
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:27,275
With a 17-year-old boy?
- And the mother.

13
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:28,733
I'm ready

14
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:29,928
Did you find Vasili?

15
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:32,725
Vasili is not in a very
trusting mood just yet.

16
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,155
Doesn't he know who the mole is?
Isn't that what started all this?

17
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,569
He was bluffing. He said he
knew that there was a mole...

18
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:40,105
Just not who it is.

19
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,132
His friend Arkady Volk told him.

20
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,788
You told Sirin about me?

21
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:44,960
We should talk about it...

22
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:47,132
I'm done talking. You just
about got me burned.

23
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,272
We need to get to Volk.

24
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:49,592
That's not possible.

25
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:51,810
It's the only way. He's the only one
who knows the identity of the mole.

26
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:53,060
You won't get near him.

27
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:54,420
I think I know someone who can.

28
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:57,288
I need your help.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,074

30
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:47,383
Lior's business is financed
by the Kremlin.

31
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:50,008
He took money from them?
- He's an SVR asset.

32
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,790
I didn't do this to you.
You did this to yourself.

33
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:56,685
Frankly, the only part I'm having a hard time
believing is how anybody can be such a loser.

34
00:01:56,822 --> 00:01:58,665
What did you do, Gordon?

35
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:01,053
Gordon, what the fuck did you do?

36
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,002
Let's go, Piper

37
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,760
You guys keep asking the same questions.
I keep giving the same answers.

38
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:21,033
You know how Einstein defined insanity?

39
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,823
Just because you drag me out
of bed in the middle of the night...

40
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:24,440
Give it a rest, man.
Your wife is here.

41
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,470
Don't fuck in there.

42
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,260
Baby, what happened to your face

43
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,197
What did you do to him?
Did you hit him?

44
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:01,080
He didn't hit me

45
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,908
Who hit you?

46
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,588
Baby, leave it alone.

47
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:09,641
We'd like some privacy, please.
- You've got five minutes.

48
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,243
You're OK?

49
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:16,028
I don't want you in here right now.

50
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:17,920
Sydney called in some favors

51
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:20,380
Jesus? What did you tell the kids?

52
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:21,826
That you were working

53
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,627
It's not that I could have
told them much else.

54
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,951
I've got no fucking clue what's going on.

55
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:30,789
Gordon, what the fuck is going on?

56
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:43,854
They think I'm spying for the Russians.

57
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,489
Did you tell them they're wrong?

58
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:53,356
Yes

59
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,732
Did you tell them
they're fucking stupid and

60
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:57,060
they should have their
collective head examined?

61
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:00,551
How do you know I didn't do it?

62
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:03,672
Gordon...

63
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,104
I know you.

64
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,252
You're not a liar and
you're not a cheat.

65
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,793
I took money from a guy who
works for Russian intelligence.

66
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:29,516
Did you know? That he
worked for Russian intelligence?

67
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,228
No, he offered me a job.

68
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:34,767
I...I asked him to
advance me some money

69
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,549
You mean he set you up?

70
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:44,104
Yeah.

71
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,293
I'm just so tired...

72
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:56,743
Despite what you thing,
I never, ever lost faith in you.

73
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:00,087
How much longer are you
going to keep that up for?

74
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:02,782
For fucking ever!
Okay?

75
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:05,134
You do not get to go to your dark place!

76
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:07,189
I need you here.
I need you with me.

77
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:10,565
If...I don't go to jail

78
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:14,479
for accepting money from a
foreign intelligence agent...

79
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:17,659
...which is a big fucking if

80
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:21,206
I'll never get a job again.

81
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:24,370
My reputation is permanently ruined.

82
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:26,948
Honey, it's not going to come to that, okay?

83
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,994
Sydney already said the
reason that they've kept this quiet...

84
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,441
is 'cause they don't have
the evidence to charge you.

85
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:35,323
They're on a fucking fishing
expedition, okay?

86
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,089
Now we are getting you out of here

87
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,198
and we are going to sue the
shit out of these motherfuckers.

88
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:42,175
What?
- We're going to sue the government?

89
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,675
Yes, we are going to sue
everybody, babe. Everybody.

90
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:50,450
How are you even doing this right now?
Where is this energy coming from?

91
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,474
Go with it.

92
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:54,934
My love for you is a very
fucking powerful thing.

93
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,895
All right?

94
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:59,192
And anybody who messes
with that better watch their ass!

95
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,872
Okay. Now we are
fighting for you out there.

96
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:03,708
And you've got to promise
me that you are fighting in here.

97
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:05,887
You tell me you're
gonna fight, Gordon.

98
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:09,551
I'm gonna fight.
- Yeah?

99
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,730
Fuck, yeah!

100
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,559
Good.

101
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:19,004
Let's go...

102
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,102
I'm sorry for putting
you through all this.

103
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,721
I can do this standing on my head.

104
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:35,446
You're amazing.
I don't deserve you.

105
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:37,203
Yes, you fucking do.

106
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:43,734
I love you.

107
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:25,238
How's my fucking wife?

108
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:35,912
Did you ever think that maybe the
Russians were setting Gordon up?

109
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:38,224
Is it the same photo
from Bob's office?

110
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:40,788
What if it was put
there as a plant?

111
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,757
You got Gordon served
to you on a silver platter

112
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:45,835
by a single source
inside the SVR

113
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:48,267
whose identity is
known only to you?

114
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:51,784
I feel like they know.

115
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,628
Maybe you were the one
who was approached...

116
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:57,855
Fuck!

117
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:35,306
Well, she's coming.

118
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,094
How did you get
her to agree to that?

119
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,071
I told her to come
hear what we had to say

120
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:42,672
and if she didn't like it,
we'd part as friends.

121
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:53,569
And I said if she didn't
come I'd show up at her office.

122
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:00,761
That was stupid.

123
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:03,519
You know, I guessed
this is what would happen.

124
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,917
Maybe she's not coming.

125
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:34,512
And maybe she's
not coming to talk.

126
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:37,959
You think she'd do that?

127
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:40,586
She's not someone you want as your enemy.

128
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:43,508
You're scared she's gonna
hold my actions against you.

129
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,092
I just told you
what I'm scared of.

130
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:55,002
I had this whole plan in my
mind about how this would all go.

131
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,332
Now, looking back, it
all seems so naive.

132
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:01,015
Happens to me all the time.

133
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,683
Yet we continue to make plans.

134
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,321
Your girlfriend fall asleep?

135
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:27,407
You trying to give me a heart attack, man?

136
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:31,657
I wasn't sure if this would be
a negotiation or a dung fight.

137
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,517
Figured I'd better see you first.

138
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:35,251
That how bad things
have got between us?

139
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:38,852
Last time we spoke you dictated the terms
of your retirement to me via blackmail

140
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:44,165
And you got drunk and told Vasili Sirin
you had an asset operating inside the CIA.

141
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:48,671
I made a mistake.
I trusted Vasili like a brother

142
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,070
but I never told him your name.

143
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,382
My loyalties aren't changing.

144
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:56,850
You know, it don't seem fair that the
man who recruited me to be a double agent

145
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:59,125
would criticize me for disloyalty.

146
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:01,757
D'you think we were
going to do this forever?

147
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:04,195
What was the point of killing
Partridge and setting up Gordon

148
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:05,936
if I'm not free to live my life?

149
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:10,053
Just tell me what I need to
do to be done and I'll do it.

150
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:11,805
Isn't it obvious?

151
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:15,991
There's an extremely resourceful
man whose life is on the line

152
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,554
and the only way he can save
it is by discovering who you are

153
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:22,498
and selling that information
to the Americans.

154
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:25,858
Neither one of us will be
safe until he's eliminated.

155
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:57,271
I'm going to start
calling you "boomerang".

156
00:12:57,474 --> 00:12:59,154
You look like you're dying.

157
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,645
Probably quite soon.

158
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:03,599
Not soon enough.

159
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,255
You could have been dead already.

160
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,763
I could have finished you.

161
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:11,357
It would have made more sense.

162
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:15,679
She says she helped me
against her better judgment

163
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:18,924
You, too. I could have
killed you in the woods.

164
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,916
Oh, yeah?
Why didn't you?

165
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:24,041
Because I had a soft spot for this one,
but it hardened overnight.

166
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:26,343
Your boss framed
an innocent man.

167
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:27,855
Innocent to whom?

168
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:30,877
You are not on my side,
neither is Piper.

169
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:33,924
So he wasn't on your side?
So I'm right?

170
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:36,019
Gordon isn't the mole.

171
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,060
So who is?

172
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,029
Katya. I made a mistake

173
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:47,660
This is the only way
to put things right.

174
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,757
You're making another
mistake right now.

175
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:53,495
I don't know who it is.

176
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,580
It's the truth.

177
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,403
Volk didn't trust me with that.

178
00:13:57,654 --> 00:13:58,794
I don't think he trusts me at all

179
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:00,599
I need to find out who it is.

180
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:03,153
You should ask him yourself.
- I'm ready to do that.

181
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:05,302
You will never get near him.

182
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,653
You don't even know
what my plan is yet.

183
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:13,064
Watch out for this one.
He wants to kill himself.

184
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:14,979
She says you're suicidal

185
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,536
The next time we meet,
it'll be as enemies.

186
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:36,263
You too.

187
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,345
She said...
- Yeah, I know what she said.

188
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,051
Listen!
- I'm done listening to you.

189
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:50,651
Then listen to yourself...

190
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,120
You could have been dead already.

191
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:54,589
I could have finished you.

192
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:57,768
It would have made more sense.

193
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,538
She says she helped me
against her better judgment.

194
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:04,623
You, too. I could have
killed you in the woods.

195
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,670
Oh, yeah,
Why didn't you?

196
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,270
Because I had a soft spot for this one,
but it hardened overnight.

197
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:14,169
I should kill you.

198
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:17,856
If you don't help us then this goes
to the Russian embassy in 24 hours.

199
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,684
You were right. We're
not on the same team

200
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:23,459
This was a helpful reminder.

201
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,359
You are punching way
above your weight class.

202
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,099
How?

203
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:34,841
We lure Volk to a secure
location, we kidnap him...

204
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:38,341
and then we force the identity of the
mole out of him by any means necessary.

205
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,927
Hey, we're going to try something crazy.

206
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,763
You said, "Hear me out...

207
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:50,988
"If you don't like what I have to
say, we'll part as friends."

208
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:52,911
It turns out I don't like
what you had to say.

209
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,028
Well, I'm afraid I lied to you.

210
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,185
Well, then, why should
I trust you now?

211
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:56,817
Because you don't have a choice.

212
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,901
What you have is 23
hours and 59 minutes.

213
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:08,619
Goodnight.

214
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,882
AAAAH!

215
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:48,992
Hello, Peter.

216
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:52,898
Jesus!

217
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,015
How?

218
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,850
When are they going to print?

219
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:03,523
Can we stop it?

220
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,841
It's Tracy. Leave a message.

221
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:26,130
Somebody leaked
the story to the press.

222
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,856
Everything is upside fucking down.
I have lost control.

223
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:33,302
I need my sounding board.
Where the fuck are you?

224
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:36,365
Fuck! Fuck! FUCK!

225
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:40,232
Tracy?
- Hey.

226
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:45,991
Where did you go?

227
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:48,835
I, uh, sorry, I had a work thing.
Listen...

228
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:51,314
It doesn't matter.
We have to leave.

229
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,054
What?

230
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:53,622
Sammy was arrested.

231
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:59,289
Sammy? Are you okay?
Are you sure?

232
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:00,867
Okay, good, listen to me.

233
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:03,304
Everything's going to be fine,
okay, I'm going to handle this.

234
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:05,598
I'm going to pick you
up from Nana's later.

235
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:07,195
Could you put Nana back on?

236
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,325
I love you, too.

237
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:12,154
Mom, listen up.
No, we don't need a lawyer, okay?

238
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,242
I just need you to
go into my closet

239
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:15,898
and get the shoebox
out of the right side.

240
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:18,054
There's a little black
phone book inside of it.

241
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:19,805
No, it was Sam's.

242
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,540
I need you to get Rueull Abbott's
contact information and call me back.

243
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,337
Hey! Hey! Get up.

244
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:32,669
Where are we going?

245
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:35,149
We gotta get out of here.

246
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,133
In case Katerina decides you're a
more expedient path than cooperation.

247
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,586
Where are we going to go?

248
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:44,804
A friend of mine is out of town
and her kids are at her grandma's.

249
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,796
Sounds like a fairy tale.

250
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,390
You look like shit.

251
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:00,529
You all right?

252
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,065
Fine

253
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:20,677
I need your help

254
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:41,838
Sirin came to my
place that night

255
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:44,711
after my polygraph test.

256
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:46,727
He was hurt.

257
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:50,335
I took care of him. I asked
him to leave, but he didn't.

258
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,227
The next day, when you
came in, he was still there...

259
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:56,688
Hiding

260
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:02,803
I took him to the safe house
where we found him later.

261
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,864
I lied to you.

262
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:07,520
I didn't think I had any choice.

263
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:13,292
It was me who met Joe
Turner at Union Station.

264
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,595
You just missed us.

265
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:22,320
You mean, when we
were at the house...

266
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:24,997
You lost him deliberately.

267
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:30,773
I let him get away
into the woods.

268
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,721
Why are you telling me all this?

269
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:38,087
I've got no choice.

270
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:40,393
Turner's blackmailing me.

271
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,691
He wants me to lure you into a trap.

272
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:50,313
All I can do is...
ask for your mercy.

273
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:08,145
Give me one reason not to
kill you here and now.

274
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,835
What if you're still playing me...

275
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:12,749
Still setting me up to get trapped.

276
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:15,304
My feelings towards
you have changed.

277
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:21,338
So now you think I'm stupid?

278
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,066
On the contrary. That's
the last thing I think you are.

279
00:21:23,174 --> 00:21:26,828
Well then...

280
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,019
Get up!
You're gonna be late.

281
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:54,481
Hey, Reuel.

282
00:23:00,106 --> 00:23:03,340
I think I missed my
true calling as an artist.

283
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:06,232
Hell, I think it's fucked up we're
torturing him like this.

284
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:09,613
The boss wants to fuck with him,
I want to make the boss happy.

285
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,340
That's probably what
they said at Abu Ghraib.

286
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:13,129
This isn't Abu Ghraib.

287
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:16,519
Not yet.
Somebody fucked up.

288
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:18,517
No-one was supposed
to know about this shit.

289
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,033
Why are you smiling like that?

290
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:22,601
Hi, it's Eva Piper calling
for Senator Thrush.

291
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:26,589
Eva Piper calling.

292
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:29,542
I'm not here

293
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:37,973
Okay, err... I understand.

294
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:40,918
Can you just tell her that I'm
around whenever she has the time.

295
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:42,371
It's very important.

296
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:44,553
Mr Abbott's office.

297
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:47,405
It's Robin Larkin
calling for him.

298
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:49,843
I don't have Mr Abbott for
you right now Ms Larkin.

299
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,680
Tell him I know he
planted the Piper story

300
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:53,810
I'm sorry?

301
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,388
There's no-one else who could have done it.

302
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:58,377
Why would Mr Abbott leak a
story that makes us look bad...

303
00:24:58,377 --> 00:24:59,970
...and you and your
department look good.

304
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:03,737
I don't know. That's the
part that fucking scares me.

305
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:12,918
Morning, boss.
He's fucking dying in there, boss.

306
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:20,961
You showed him the newspaper...
- Yeah.

307
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:25,831
Who the fuck told
you to do that?

308
00:25:32,255 --> 00:25:33,255
Go!

309
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,027
Where the fuck are you?

310
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,019
Mr Abbott's office.

311
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:06,419
It's Mae, Barbara.
Is he there?

312
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:08,746
I am sorry Mrs Barber, he's not today.

313
00:26:08,785 --> 00:26:13,020
Tell Rueul that I got his message.
Loud and clear.

314
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,926
Get him to call me back.
- Okay, Mrs Barber.

315
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:29,118
You know, I'd be losing my
shit right now if you weren't here.

316
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,993
Yeah?

317
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:33,047
We make a good team.

318
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,631
You know the secret to
making a great omelette?

319
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:51,162
Breaking a few eggs?

320
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,260
Low heat.

321
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:56,448
Oh, shoot...

322
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,444
Yes, Barbara?

323
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:05,101
May Barber and Robin
Larkin both called.

324
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,023
Tell them I'll call
them both back. Okay?

325
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:08,226
Anything else?

326
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:11,312
Mae Barber seemed to think
you were behind the paper...

327
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:19,861
Is this typical behaviour for you?

328
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,268
Taking days off, not
returning phone calls?

329
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:26,408
No, and my assistant
must be very perplexed.

330
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:31,200
You're a strange bird, Rueul Abbott.
- Thank you.

331
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:34,907
People our age are generally
pretty set in their ways.

332
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:36,196
Well, it's your fault.

333
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:38,540
You made me want
to be another person.

334
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,854
Well, it kind of scares me.
- Why?

335
00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:45,113
Because the person you already
are has great responsibilities...

336
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:48,331
and you seem willing to put those on
hold for a woman you've only just met.

337
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:50,163
She's a very special woman.

338
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:53,187
I like you a lot but I'm worried

339
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:57,386
that you're going to do something
that has nothing to do with me.

340
00:27:58,316 --> 00:28:00,800
Oh. You're worried about me.

341
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,621
May I show you something?

342
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:09,490
That is me, on the Yale divinity
course where I was recruited.

343
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,294
Divinity?

344
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:12,998
I actually wanted to be a pastor.

345
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:15,479
Really?
Mmm. You sound surprised.

346
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:17,775
You know, I was...

347
00:28:19,703 --> 00:28:22,303
I was actually a
conscientious objector.

348
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:27,545
I wanted to be the next
William Sloane Coffin.

349
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:29,791
But why did you join the CIA?

350
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:34,461
I was inspired by the civil
rights movement - don't laugh.

351
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:42,481
It sounds perverse, I know but I
could see the social change that was..

352
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:46,044
..happening in America and I
wanted to bring those human rights

353
00:28:46,044 --> 00:28:47,724
to the rest of the world.

354
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:50,647
So, here I am marching.

355
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:53,352
I wore cowboy boots for about five years

356
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:56,026
I wanted to be taller,
so I wore cowboy boots!

357
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:58,781
I absolutely destroyed my feet.

358
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,317
So actually I...I really like
becoming someone else.

359
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:10,342
I'm reconnecting with
the person that I once was.

360
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,782
And I thought it was
important that I show you this.

361
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:19,596
Marching again...

362
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,743
Now may I feed you?

363
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:25,404
Yes...

364
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,321
I got the bags.
- Thank you.

365
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:36,365
Boys here?

366
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:39,227
No, I gotta go pick them
up from my mom.

367
00:29:47,073 --> 00:29:48,073
Jesus!

368
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,902
Did you know about this?

369
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,690
Is it true?

370
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:58,581
I don't know.

371
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:05,468
I don't think so, but...
...I don't know.

372
00:30:08,343 --> 00:30:09,991
This is what you and
Joe have been doing?

373
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,585
I can't get anything
past the spy's wife...

374
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:16,692
or the spy's father...

375
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:24,613
Hey...This is work and it's
a very complicated case.

376
00:30:41,387 --> 00:30:42,387
Hey!

377
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,268
What are you doing here?

378
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:46,823
I live here.
- You said you were out of town.

379
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,526
Yeah, we came back early.
- Are the kids here?

380
00:30:49,225 --> 00:30:50,974
They're at my mom's.
What's going on?

381
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,748
Mae, we needed somewhere to go.

382
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:56,823
We?

383
00:30:56,894 --> 00:31:01,230
My friend is sick. He has
an infection in his leg...

384
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,745
So take him to a hospital.

385
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:04,105
He can't go to a hospital.

386
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:06,496
So you brought him here?
I didn't know where else to take him.

387
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:09,007
You said you were going
to be out of town. I'm sorry.

388
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:11,037
He's not doing well.

389
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:12,863
This must be Basil?

390
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:16,584
Please...

391
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,950
Why D'you bring him to my home?

392
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:49,833
You really think you can trust this
woman to betray her own people?

393
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:52,576
You don't even know her.

394
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:57,671
I don't have a choice.
But neither does she.

395
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:01,152
I think...I think she'll do it.

396
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,245
And in your mind where
does this all get staged?

397
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:12,246
I don't know. I don't suppose you've got a
spare safe house kicking around, do you?

398
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:13,653
I might.

399
00:32:15,387 --> 00:32:16,387
I can help.

400
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:29,029
I can't put anyone else in danger.
Gordon is a friend of mine.

401
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:33,014
He's being set up and I'll do
everything I can to help him.

402
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:34,636
Hey!
- Hey!

403
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:39,632
I gave him an antibiotic and a
tranquilizer, so he'll be out for a while.

404
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:42,494
I'll call my mom and ask her
to keep the kids again tonight.

405
00:32:43,674 --> 00:32:45,330
Do you want to help
me get him downstairs?

406
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,464
Of course.

407
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:57,254
Hey!

408
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,060
I will do what you asked.

409
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:01,332
Stay by the phone.
I'll be in touch.

410
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:13,229
Good....time for a drink.

411
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:36,510
Our good health...

412
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:41,043
About that poison you gave Polina...

413
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:44,282
Was it in the caviar or the vodka?

414
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:48,101
The vodka.

415
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:20,960
Excuse me...

416
00:34:31,343 --> 00:34:31,937
Hello.

417
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:33,659
I know where Vasili Sirin's
going to be tomorrow.

418
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,099
Stay by your phone

419
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:38,135
There's a woman - one
of yours - who's helping.

420
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:39,215
I know where.

421
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,106
Where the fuck have you been?

422
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:53,139
I told you I was going out of town
for a couple of days. I just got back.

423
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:54,341
I got played.

424
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,755
By who?

425
00:34:55,833 --> 00:35:00,022
Rueul. And the Russians.
And probably a bunch of other people.

426
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:02,734
Phoenix is fucking gone.

427
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,368
Probably dead.
Definitely my fault.

428
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:08,350
But Abbott leaked
the story to the press...

429
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,272
which means he wanted 
it out there, which...

430
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:16,005
...means they walked right into a setup.

431
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:17,609
And you let me.

432
00:35:17,636 --> 00:35:20,628
You're saying Abbott is concealing
evidence that proves Gordon is innocent?

433
00:35:20,675 --> 00:35:25,140
Right. I know that Gordon is your friend,
but right now I could really use a friend.

434
00:35:25,698 --> 00:35:26,818
Where are you?

435
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,870
At my house.

436
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:30,618
I'm on my way.

437
00:35:33,725 --> 00:35:34,935
Where the hell is he?

438
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:37,717
I'm sorry, Mrs Barber. 
He's at a party until midnight.

439
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:40,568
Well, call him at home. This is a personal
matter. I need to speak to him today.

440
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:42,608
I really am sorry, Mrs Barber...

441
00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:48,990
Is everything all right?
No. Your friend's going to be okay.

442
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:51,091
Thank you.

443
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,552
We've got to get him out
of here as soon as possible.

444
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:54,982
I will.
- I've got my own shit to deal with.

445
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:55,982
I promise.

446
00:36:11,874 --> 00:36:12,914
I'm fucked...

447
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,089
You're not fucked

448
00:36:14,136 --> 00:36:15,652
I am so fucking fucked

449
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:19,169
You're not fucking fucked.
C'mon...

450
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:22,544
Let's have a drink and tell me
everything. Start from the beginning.

451
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,051
What I'm hearing is
a lot of speculation.

452
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:36,151
We don't know that Gordon was set up
and we don't know that you were set up.

453
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,337
You said it yourself from the start.

454
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:41,619
They used Phoenix to feed me Gordon.
You were right.

455
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:44,994
You said that Phoenix was paranoid.
-Yeah...

456
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,203
Then maybe he can't
reach out right now.

457
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:52,198
Look, just think. There's no
sense in us getting all spun out.

458
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:55,526
Hey, we just need to relax so
that we can think clearly.

459
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:07,324
Holy shit!

460
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:10,250
Holy shit!

461
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,007
It's the one thing I know
how to do in the kitchen.

462
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:15,035
That's your second-best room.

463
00:37:15,124 --> 00:37:17,766
You know what I think?
- What do your think?

464
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:20,428
I think we should go away together.

465
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:26,607
Maybe if we pretend we're not
hearing whoever it is will just leave.

466
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:31,395
Maybe we're being
attacked by North Korea.

467
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,763
Don't let your eggs get cold.

468
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:41,056
Drop the charges.

469
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:42,747
This is a terrible time, Mae.

470
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:45,459
You found out that I spoke to Senator
Thrush and you had him arrested?

471
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:48,327
No, Sam was arrested because
he sent a SWAT team....

472
00:37:48,327 --> 00:37:50,828
I'll call Senator Thrush right now
and recant every word that I said.

473
00:37:50,828 --> 00:37:52,727
I'll tell her that I was lying.
I will do whatever you want.

474
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:54,055
What I want is...
- He's seventeen!

475
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:57,141
I would like you to leave this house
and come back tomorrow, please!

476
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,500
Fuck you! I am not leaving until
you tell me that we have a deal.

477
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:01,211
Okay, we have a deal.

478
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:03,352
Swear on Melanie's soul.

479
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,476
I swear on Melanie's soul.

480
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,208
But I hope she's not watching.

481
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:16,856
Oh, my God. 
Mae!

482
00:38:17,138 --> 00:38:20,841
I behaved unconscionably
to you and your family. Mae!

483
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:22,575
I deeply regret it.

484
00:38:26,855 --> 00:38:29,964
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I...I'm so sorry...

485
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:32,662
Whatever you do,
just tell me the truth.

486
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:43,803
I had Mae's son arrested... because
he sent a SWAT team to my home.

487
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,636
I could have been killed.

488
00:38:46,644 --> 00:38:50,229
This is, like, you had him
arrested as an act of retaliation.

489
00:38:50,316 --> 00:38:51,996
Retaliation against what?

490
00:38:56,027 --> 00:38:59,598
Well, I threatened his mother...
...to protect him.

491
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,721
It's a very sensitive operation and
really I shouldn't be talking about this.

492
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:04,566
It's classified information.

493
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:07,667
But she was trying to go public.

494
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:12,364
So, all the horrible shit I've
read about you online - it's all true.

495
00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:19,809
I've done some terrible, terrible things...

496
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:22,661
But, um...

497
00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:26,107
I was always doing it...

498
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:30,602
...in the belief that it was for
the greater good, but, um...

499
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:34,608
I was wrong, and...

500
00:39:35,814 --> 00:39:37,494
...and knowing you has...

501
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:39,372
it's...it's...

502
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,614
...it's made me want to...

503
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:47,322
...re-examine my life. I want
to go back to the person I was.

504
00:39:47,322 --> 00:39:49,805
I strongly suggest you do that

505
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:55,983
Please...
- I really am sorry...

506
00:39:56,046 --> 00:39:59,382
Holly, please, please...
Holly! Holly!

507
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:40,454
He hasn't touched his food all day.

508
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:43,554
Look at him. He
hasn't even moved.

509
00:40:44,453 --> 00:40:47,218
Maybe we should call her...
- And tell her what?

510
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:49,398
The prisoner is, err...

511
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:59,862
You know, when I was 
in Athens, I was riding high.

512
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:03,004
I could see round fucking corners.

513
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:06,831
And a piano fell on my head...

514
00:41:09,664 --> 00:41:12,243
I'm just saying that the real
bad shit that happens here

515
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:13,720
is not the shit
you're worried about.

516
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,588
It's the shit that you could
never imagine would happen.

517
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,695
You're not really making
me feel much better

518
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:24,806
You know, what I regret is...

519
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:27,818
...is wishing that you could change
something that is unchangeable.

520
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,094
Isn't that stupid?

521
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:32,084
You don't have any regrets?

522
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,400
Whats the point?

523
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:37,518
You made your choice,
now what's the next play?

524
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,372
Why beat yourself up for
something that's already been done?

525
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:45,446
Good point.

526
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,120
That's fine, then.

527
00:41:52,604 --> 00:41:54,284
Don't ever leave again.

528
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,791
Speaking of which...
I do have to go and take care of something.

529
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:04,674
Will you be okay?
- Yeah.

530
00:42:07,112 --> 00:42:09,806
Go! Get out of here.

531
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:19,296
You're a good friend, Trace.

532
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:27,036
Well, you're a good friend
to be a good friend to...

533
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:32,725
We'll see how this
Gordon stuff plays out.

534
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:34,732
The truth always
comes out in the end.

535
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:35,748
Yeah.

536
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:41,173
Give Phoenix time.
- I will.

537
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:45,206
She'll reach out when
she feels she can.

538
00:42:48,228 --> 00:42:53,071
Yeah, maybe you're right. I'm
just spinning out over nothing.

539
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:56,356
Thank you.
Thanks again.

540
00:43:09,747 --> 00:43:10,747
You okay?

541
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:16,215
I said "she", didn't I?

542
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:20,215
What the fuck, Trace?

543
00:43:21,738 --> 00:43:24,482
Robin...
- No, come on...

544
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:20,391
She saw that Laura and Mary were
still awake and she said to them...

545
00:44:20,763 --> 00:44:23,193
Go to sleep, girls. 
Everything's all right.

546
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:25,338
Pa will be here in the morning.

547
00:44:27,148 --> 00:44:31,499
Then she went back to her rocking
chair and sat there rocking gently...

548
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:34,070
hugging baby Carrie in her arms.

549
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:37,260
In the morning, Pa was there...

550
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:41,393
That's a good place to stop.

551
00:44:42,231 --> 00:44:44,097
Fine, baby.

552
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:48,707
I love you so much.

553
00:45:39,915 --> 00:45:41,982
Get the epinephrine.
Go! go! go!

554
00:45:42,665 --> 00:45:44,743
Gordon, come on! Come on!
Breathe!

555
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:01,087
Come on!

556
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,186
Oh, fuck it!

557
00:46:25,557 --> 00:46:26,997
I got a safe house

558
00:46:27,987 --> 00:46:31,221
It's not really a safe 
house, but it'll work.

559
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,760
Okay.

560
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:38,259
Well, then, let's do it.

560
00:46:39,305 --> 00:47:39,761
