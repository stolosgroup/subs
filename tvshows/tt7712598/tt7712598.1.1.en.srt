1
00:00:00,757 --> 00:00:02,375
2,000 years ago,

2
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:04,078
Anthony and Cleopatra,

3
00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:07,756
two of the most powerful people
in the world, fell in love.

4
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:10,931
Their relationship brought
civil war to the Roman Empire

5
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:13,972
and an end to the
Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt.

6
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:15,869
They were said to be buried together.

7
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,318
Throughout the ages,

8
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:20,107
their final resting place
has remained hidden.

9
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:21,742
Until now.

11
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,749
Doctor, this is a dead end.

12
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:55,590
No, Max. This is a door.

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,818
Here's where the lever
would go to open it.

14
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:02,954
Wait. So your theory was right?

15
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,656
There's only one way to find out.

16
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:32,845
Light it up.

17
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,253
What the...?

18
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,505
There's only one of them here.

19
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,007
It's only Antony.

20
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:58,014
Dr. Castillo! Come.

21
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:01,479
You see?

22
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,671
Afrika Korps

23
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:11,789
from the Nazi invasion of Egypt.

24
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:13,987
So, what, they found the
secret room and got sealed in?

25
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:17,107
- By who?
- It doesn't make any sense.

26
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:19,748
"All those who would disturb the sacred

27
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:22,301
"tomb will come to no swift death

28
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:24,869
"and be cursed for all eternity."

29
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,009
Call back to base camp.

30
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:33,183
Notify the Egyptian
Ministry of our find.

31
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,773
Stay right here.

32
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,687
Oh.

33
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,244
Get up.

34
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,893
Where's the other sarcophagus?

35
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:15,920
Where is Cleopatra?

36
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,291
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

37
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,882
Set the explosives.

38
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:23,494
- No! No, you can't.
- Take her.

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,994
- And deal with them.
- No! No!

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,800
No! No! You can't do that! No!

41
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,574
Aah!

43
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:35,697
Danny?

44
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,034
Yoshi.

45
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:39,403
This is incredible.

46
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:43,040
How do you not just stare
at this stuff all day?

47
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,676
I appreciate you coming by,
Danny, but I'm kind of busy,

48
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:47,640
- so if you want to get to the point...
- Not a problem.

49
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,251
I just came to take the Vermeer.

50
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:52,013
- I'll be out of your way.
- Dude, we talked about this.

51
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,629
I can't just give away a Vermeer.

52
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,493
You won't be giving it away.
You'll be giving it back

53
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:57,099
to its rightful owner, my client.

54
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:58,388
You know, we have provenance on this

55
00:04:58,394 --> 00:04:59,785
painting going back over 70 years.

56
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,800
I have a photo of my
client with the painting.

57
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:05,374
You have a photo of a little girl

58
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,899
who could be anyone standing in front

59
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:08,673
of what may or may not be our painting.

60
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,414
Look, this photo... unlike the
rest of my client's family...

61
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:13,382
Is all that made it out of Auschwitz.

62
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,824
Okay. Fine.

63
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,613
Let's do this. You see, the Nazis...

64
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,132
They weren't just murderers.

65
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:22,781
They were murderers who
kept meticulous records.

66
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,529
These are manifests for art

67
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:26,946
seized by Hitler's treasure
hunters in the E.R.R.

68
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,885
Now here is an entry for the painting,

69
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:30,258
as well as the family name Hoffman.

70
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:32,386
The painting is then transferred
to the Jeu de Paume in Paris,

71
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:33,681
where it is received
by Hermann Göring...

72
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:34,911
Okay, okay, okay!

73
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,317
Look, I'm trying to help, Danny,

74
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:39,258
but this painting will sell
at auction for $30 million.

75
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,160
Yoshi...

76
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:42,962
I feel the good in you.

77
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,330
The conflict.

78
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:45,832
Sorry to interrupt, fellas.

79
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,467
- Mr. Reece.
- Jay.

80
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,125
I had no idea that you
were visiting us today.

81
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,364
Actually, I need him.

82
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,305
And I couldn't help overhearing.

83
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,212
So, Yoshi, here's the deal.

84
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,733
The auction house is gonna give
Danny the painting for free.

85
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,873
In return, pick any two paintings.

86
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,281
I'll exhibit them in my
museum for, say, six months.

87
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,750
They'll double in value,
and you'll get to avoid all

88
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:07,125
the bad PR that'll come
from his client's lawsuit,

89
00:06:07,187 --> 00:06:08,721
which I will pay for.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,030
That's very generous of you, Mr. Reece.

91
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm sure that we can find a way

92
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:14,460
to accommodate you.

93
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:16,796
Thank you, Yoshi. Thank you, Jay.

94
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:18,359
Nothin', kid. Come
on, my ride's waiting.

95
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:19,499
How's it going, Yates?

96
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:20,967
Not too bad, Danny. Yourself?

97
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:23,803
- Living the dream.
- Attaboy.

98
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:34,247
Ana Castillo was there,
Danny, at the pyramids.

99
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,317
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

100
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:39,968
It appears she's been taken,

101
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:41,938
along with her discovery.

102
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:44,845
She found Antony and Cleopatra.

103
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,665
After all these years, she found them.

104
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,327
Whoa-oa-oa. Hold on.

105
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:52,031
Dr. Castillo found Antony and Cleopatra?

106
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,666
In the pyramids?

107
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:55,106
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

108
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:56,978
But she discovered evidence
that they had been moved

109
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,605
into the pyramids hundreds of years ago.

110
00:06:59,673 --> 00:07:01,107
She sent me a message

111
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:04,343
that she had found the tomb
right before the attack.

112
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:06,282
Her body wasn't there, so I

113
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:08,979
need you to help me find her.

114
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:12,952
Jay, you-you know what
Dr. Castillo means to me.

115
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,121
I want to help, but I'm...

116
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,956
I'm not that guy anymore.

117
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:18,357
You should call the FBI.

118
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:20,793
Well, I would, if you
still worked there.

119
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:23,262
All right, look, the best
way to find Ana is to

120
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,169
follow the treasure to the terrorists,

121
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:27,233
the same way you tracked Karim Farouk.

122
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,873
That didn't exactly end well.

123
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:30,469
Danny, there's nobody better

124
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,805
at tracking blood antiquities than you.

125
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,085
And I promise, you will have

126
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,047
every dollar, every connection

127
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:38,377
that is mine at your disposal.

128
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:40,980
Ana does not have time
for all the red tape.

129
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:43,749
She needs you to save her.

130
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:56,762
You're letting me borrow your jet?

131
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,631
One of my jets, yeah.

132
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,666
For incidentals.

133
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:03,469
You get a fix on Ana's
location, you call me.

134
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:05,071
I'll send in the K&R team.

135
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:08,241
Do not rush in there trying
to make up for the past.

136
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:10,476
Can you call in a favor,
pull a passport for me?

137
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:13,294
Yeah, give me the name, I'll
have Yates track it for you.

138
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,745
Lexi Vaziri.

139
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:17,178
Tell me you're joking.

140
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:19,680
- I need her.
- Well, that's honest, at least.

141
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:21,043
I need her help

142
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:22,672
to find Dr. Castillo.

143
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:24,824
Kid, I know how much
you love to try and save

144
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,200
beautiful, broken things...

145
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,461
I appreciate you trying
to look out for me, Jay,

146
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,696
but I know what I'm doing.

147
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,194
Safe flight, Danny.

148
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,960
I suppose this will do.

149
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,090
It's the best they have.

150
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:03,229
So, how does a Middle Eastern
girl get an English accent?

151
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:07,066
Boarding school. Briarcliff.

152
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:09,468
- I went to Kerrisdale.
- Mm.

153
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,343
Our rowing club crushed you every

154
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:13,210
year at the Regatta.

155
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:16,887
You cheated every year at the Regatta.

156
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:19,429
Half your team was on steroids.

157
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:28,054
Why are you still dressed?

158
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:00,976
Hello there.

159
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:23,755
Who are you?

160
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,077
I'm his mistress.

161
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:28,147
I'm his mistress!

162
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:45,831
Hey!

163
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,025
Hey!

164
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:13,131
Hey.

165
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:14,449
O-Okay...

166
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:16,851
- You have got to be joking.
- I know you didn't...

167
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:18,858
Look, I get it, but it's important.

168
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:20,126
- Are you stalking me?
- No.

169
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:21,628
I tracked your passport to France.

170
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:23,041
A credit card hit on one of your

171
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:24,603
- aliases pointed me here.
- Really?

172
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,666
Okay, yeah, that did sound
like I was stalking you, but...

173
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:28,029
Someone's in trouble,

174
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:30,103
- and I need your help.
- Good old Danny McNamara.

175
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:31,386
Always playing the hero no matter

176
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:33,012
how many lives he ruins in the process.

177
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,479
Have you been watching the news?

178
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,842
Egypt?

179
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:37,051
Yeah.

180
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:39,713
Well, it wasn't just
terrorism, it was an art heist.

181
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:43,545
The tomb of Antony and
Cleopatra was in the pyramid.

182
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:45,719
You do know that the pyramids
are 2,000 years older

183
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:47,626
than Antony and Cleopatra?

184
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:50,525
- Mm.
- So why hasn't the news mentioned it?

185
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:51,725
Only four people know.

186
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:54,245
Including my mentor, Dr. Castillo,

187
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,328
who was taken.

188
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:57,400
My father always said
that tomb was cursed.

189
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,123
I don't remember you
being superstitious.

190
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:00,903
All I know is that no one
who's ever gone looking

191
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:02,051
for it has come back alive.

192
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:04,125
So I hope you find her, Danny.
Good luck.

193
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:05,198
Okay.

194
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,155
Fine. If that's what you want.

195
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:15,730
Excusez-moi.

196
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:20,001
Okay, don't do it for me.

197
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,075
Do it to help me catch the bastards

198
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:23,882
who destroyed the
symbol of your country.

199
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:26,791
Why do you need me?

200
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,554
I need someone who
thinks like a criminal...

201
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,962
Who has access to people
and places I don't.

202
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:32,630
Together, we can find Dr. Castillo

203
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,298
much faster than I can alone.

204
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:36,501
And you really think you
can get me out of this?

205
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:39,303
Yeah. The Minister of
Interior owes me a favor.

206
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:41,095
You mentioned something
about a finder's fee?

207
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:43,369
- I don't believe I did, no.
- Nice try.

208
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,176
The tomb of Antony
and Cleopatra would be

209
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:47,145
one of the biggest finds in history.

210
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:49,804
I think my efforts are worth
at least a million euros.

211
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,811
For you, a million five.

212
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:54,619
- I'm sure we can work something out.
- Good.

213
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:58,751
I heard, through the grapevine,
that some Egyptian antiquities

214
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,448
are gonna be on sale tomorrow night

215
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:02,155
at a black-market bazaar in Rome.

216
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:04,529
Don't know where or when,
but you could tag along.

217
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,032
Assuming you don't slow me down.

218
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:08,338
Deal.

219
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:10,741
Tell me: how, exactly,
were you planning on

220
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:13,744
getting to Rome while
locked behind bars?

221
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:17,547
I wasn't too worried about it.

222
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:18,682
Wait...

223
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:47,311
Freeze. FBI. Don't move.

224
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:15,716
Well, I hope you have
a good lawyer, Miss.

225
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:27,977
I heard you started some

226
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:30,058
international law firm.

227
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,589
Oh. Now who's stalking who?

228
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,191
It's a small world.

229
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,193
Yeah, I practice international law.

230
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:39,129
My "firm" is me working
out of my apartment.

231
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,365
And knowing you, most of
your clients are pro bono,

232
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:43,267
so who's footing the bill for all this?

233
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:45,435
- Jay Reece.
- Ah.

234
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,738
He was funding
Dr. Castillo's expedition.

235
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:49,774
Protecting his investment. Got it.

236
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,637
Trying to save Dr. Castillo's life.

237
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:54,244
Oh, come on, he's trying
to save the treasure

238
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:56,113
he spent a fortune to find.

239
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:57,815
I know how rich guys think.

240
00:14:57,821 --> 00:14:59,021
You don't know him.

241
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:01,346
Really? And how do you know Jacob Reece?

242
00:15:01,352 --> 00:15:04,221
It's a long story, but he's
one of the few people

243
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:05,845
who have actually been there for me.

244
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:07,819
Just like Dr. Castillo.

245
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,626
She's pretty hot.

246
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:12,129
Maybe he's boning her.

247
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:14,818
Hey, when did you steal my phone?

248
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:16,108
And how did you unlock it?

249
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:18,749
It's just a helpful little tool
I picked up in Hong Kong.

250
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,122
No one is boning...

251
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,248
Look, is it so difficult
for you to imagine

252
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,688
that sometimes people
just do nice things?

253
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:28,059
Does he call her "Dr. Castillo,"
or does he call her "Ana"?

254
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:31,493
- Aha.
- That doesn't prove anything.

255
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:33,072
Old people need love, too, Danny.

256
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:35,580
Look, they're more like my
parents than my actual parents.

257
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,988
So I just don't want to
picture them that way.

258
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:41,263
- Okay?
- You haven't changed... at all.

259
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,299
What is that supposed to mean?

260
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:46,007
Forget it. There's a reason
we were never gonna work.

261
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:49,215
Oh. There's a thousand reasons
we were never gonna work.

262
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:02,118
I've got a lead on the
black-market bazaar,

263
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:03,619
but we have to make a stop first.

264
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:05,287
You need a suit.

265
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:08,290
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

266
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:11,193
Exactly the problem.

267
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,777
You never used to mind my clothes

268
00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:14,184
when we were together.

269
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,465
That's because I assumed
it was an FBI thing.

270
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:18,440
Like they preferred for
you to dress, you know,

271
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:19,873
- boring.
- What?

272
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,914
The point is, rich people
dress in a way that signals

273
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,733
to other rich people that they belong.

274
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:25,808
That's why the $400 T-shirt exists.

275
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:28,177
Where we're going, you will
stick out like a sore thumb,

276
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:29,845
and that will get us killed.

277
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:32,219
Doesn't look like a store.

278
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,544
Oh, now you're picking a lock.

279
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,084
- Come on!
- Danny, I think we can both agree

280
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,424
that we obviously don't have time

281
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,155
to buy you a suit and get it
properly tailored for tonight.

282
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:40,680
So, this is my ex-boyfriend's place.

283
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:42,086
You're both the same size,

284
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,527
and he has style.

285
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,131
Well, don't just stand there.

286
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,663
I feel very uncomfortable
in a stolen suit.

287
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,431
Oh, calm down. He's not gonna miss it.

288
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,066
I'm not in the FBI anymore.

289
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:27,107
You break the law, I can't protect you.

290
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:30,082
Oh, I've never needed
a man to protect me.

291
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,534
Ma.

292
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:10,980
Normally, I would have shot you by now,

293
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:15,263
but Mama says I need
to work on my English.

294
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:20,930
Mama thinks your friend
is an Interpol agent.

295
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:22,958
You're joking.

296
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:25,320
He's my boy toy.
I literally got him that suit.

297
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:27,249
You can't be too careful these days.

298
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:30,811
I'm going to need proof

299
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,713
you're not working for the cops.

300
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:35,282
You can ask your daughter, Sophia.

301
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:39,107
Your daughter is a friend.

302
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:42,577
I know you haven't
spoken in a long time.

303
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:45,146
You tell me what I want to know,

304
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:48,269
and I can help smooth things
over between you two.

305
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:54,442
I-I hear she has a little boy now.

306
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,337
Niko, yeah.

307
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,924
He has his grandfather's eyes.

308
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,185
You know, I wouldn't
have minded a heads-up

309
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:08,975
that we were meeting with the Mafia.

310
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:11,095
I've got a friend in Interpol
who could have helped.

311
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:13,141
Oh, great idea.

312
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:14,971
Until your friend
tipped off the Aluzzos,

313
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:16,578
then no more black-market bazaar,

314
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:18,947
Antony and Cleopatra disappear,

315
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:22,584
you lose Dr. Castillo and
I lose my finder's fee.

316
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,426
Gwen Karlsson would never do that.

317
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:28,256
All it takes is one bad apple.

318
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:30,191
And I don't know Gwen.

319
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,226
- Agent Karlsson.
- Captain Fabi.

320
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,839
You do know you're supposed
to sip that, right?

321
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:48,176
Why is the Carabinieri
following Danny McNamara?

322
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:52,380
Come.

323
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:54,382
Let's discuss this inside.

324
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,519
McNamara is involved

325
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:59,854
in the blood antiquities ring
we've been monitoring.

326
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:02,824
I assume that's a joke.

327
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:05,693
I don't think I've ever
heard you tell a joke, Gwen.

328
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,363
Agent Karlsson.

329
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,701
My apologies. Agent Karlsson.

330
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,992
The woman with McNamara is Lexi Vaziri.

331
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:16,966
She was arrested in
Monte Carlo last night.

332
00:20:16,972 --> 00:20:18,706
McNamara pulled strings to get her out.

333
00:20:19,046 --> 00:20:21,247
They arrived together
in Rome three hours ago.

334
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,606
Coincidentally, a
dozen known traffickers

335
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:25,880
have also entered Rome
in the last 48 hours.

336
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:27,262
There's a black-market bazaar

337
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,988
happening somewhere in Rome tonight.

338
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:30,151
Captain Fabi,

339
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,219
Danny does a lot of work

340
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:32,921
repatriating stolen art.

341
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:35,156
He's probably just investigating it.

342
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,592
Well, why hasn't he liaised with me

343
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:39,332
or anyone else at the Carabinieri?

344
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,654
Did he reach out to anyone at Interpol?

345
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,166
You know, I worked with Danny
when he was at the FBI.

346
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:47,402
That was during the Farouk
investigation, right?

347
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:49,421
The one he botched by
letting him get away?

348
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:50,561
Farouk was killed.

349
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:52,530
By the Egyptians, a year later.

350
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:54,237
No thanks to the FBI.

351
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:57,579
All because of McNamara's mistake.

352
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:02,026
You know, something like that
could really change a man.

353
00:21:02,484 --> 00:21:04,352
You're being absurd.

354
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:07,904
Danny is the most moral and
ethical person I've ever met.

355
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,823
In that case, what is the
most ethical and moral person

356
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:12,184
you've ever met doing

357
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,629
meeting with the Aluzzo Mafia, hmm?

358
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:19,200
Don't forget, Agent Karlsson,

359
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,807
you are a guest here.

360
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,109
This is my investigation.

361
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:25,245
And this?

362
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,366
Well, this looks like conspiracy

363
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:29,102
to traffic in blood antiquities.

364
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:32,118
I'm going to get a
warrant for their arrest.

365
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,921
Are you at all concerned
that we don't know anything

366
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:46,789
about what we're walking into?

367
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:49,425
We know exactly what we're walking into.

368
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:52,366
A black-market bazaar thrown
by dangerous criminals,

369
00:21:52,372 --> 00:21:54,840
attended by greedy and
unscrupulous people.

370
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,114
Oh, so, for you, just
another Saturday night.

371
00:21:57,368 --> 00:21:59,302
Oh.

372
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:05,996
Carlo sent me.

373
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:09,145
Good. I thought we came
to the wrong place.

374
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:11,948
I'm taking you the back way.

375
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:13,950
Ladies first.

376
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,165
Prego.

377
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:42,082
Any problem you have with

378
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:43,727
a seller is your problem.

379
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:45,270
Unless it gets in the way of business.

380
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:46,743
Then it becomes my problem.

381
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:49,285
Don't become my problem.

382
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:06,971
It's like a rich douche convention.

383
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:12,444
Rue de Village by Pissarro.

384
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:16,546
It-it disappeared in 1938.

385
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:20,300
This statue from the
13th century was stolen

386
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,108
from the temple complex in Jaipur.

387
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:24,110
- This is incredible.
- Hmm.

388
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,879
Art.

389
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,882
It's just another version
of the $400 T-shirt.

390
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,017
Oh, come on.

391
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:34,036
You look at a van Gogh,

392
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:35,349
you're seeing the universe

393
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,022
through the eyes of a mad genius.

394
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,092
These... these objects have value

395
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:42,699
because they connect
us with our past, and...

396
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,196
... reflect who we are.

397
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:46,580
Oh, come on.

398
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:49,468
You can't possibly be that naive.

399
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:52,905
Danny, I know these people.

400
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,801
They'd come from all over the world

401
00:23:54,807 --> 00:23:56,514
to visit my father's shop.

402
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,577
He was like you, you know?

403
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,412
Every artifact had its own history.

404
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,415
He had the same lights in his
eyes when he talked about it,

405
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,151
but all they cared about was which house

406
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:08,493
something would go into,
how the color would match the...

407
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:12,491
Huh. Egyptian artifacts.

408
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:14,050
Depictions of Antony and Cleopatra.

409
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:15,623
It must be from their tomb.

410
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:17,163
Wow.

411
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,166
If the tomb was intact
when Dr. Castillo found it,

412
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:22,067
there should be a lot more stuff here.

413
00:24:22,204 --> 00:24:24,801
Yeah, like, where are
Antony and Cleopatra?

414
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:28,333
Oh. That's Aiden Shaw.

415
00:24:28,354 --> 00:24:29,544
I read his file.

416
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,366
Thought he was an arms dealer.

417
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:33,126
Well, these days, the treasure business

418
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:34,799
can be as lucrative as selling guns.

419
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:36,615
Looks like he's diversified.

420
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,617
Yeah, but he's just a middleman.

421
00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:40,160
No way he could've pulled off

422
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,804
the attack at the pyramid.

423
00:24:42,088 --> 00:24:44,356
We need to find out who hired him.

424
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,358
Interpol can get the data off his phone.

425
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:49,555
No. We can get the data off his phone.

426
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,531
Give me a bump into him,
I'll get his phone to you,

427
00:24:52,537 --> 00:24:54,469
and put it back before he
even notices it was gone.

428
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:56,849
- I don't think... I don't think...
- Oh, and don't make your move

429
00:24:56,855 --> 00:24:59,460
- until he takes the phone out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

430
00:25:00,978 --> 00:25:04,507
Your Egyptian collection
is extraordinary.

431
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:06,178
Late Ptolemaic era?

432
00:25:06,246 --> 00:25:09,548
It's not the only extraordinary
thing here tonight.

433
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:11,431
Shaw.

434
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:12,776
Aiden Shaw.

435
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,857
Enchanted.

436
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:17,823
Don't I know you?

437
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:20,702
Simon.

438
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,245
Simon Hardwick.

439
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,203
S-Swear we've met. Have we?

440
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:26,873
- I just have one of those faces.
- Oh, right.

441
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,374
What's your game?

442
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:30,376
What, are you a buyer?
You a seller? You...

443
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,776
Oh, uh, uh, appraisal, mostly.

444
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,449
Had my eye on her as well.

445
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,174
Procurement's my expertise.

446
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,882
You know, I, um, I
get things for people.

447
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:43,723
Hard to get, high-value things.

448
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:47,287
Guys like us should
really stick together...

449
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:49,639
... Special Agent McNamara.

450
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:52,698
Yeah, it took me a while to place you.

451
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:54,534
I was out of my element
the last time we met.

452
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,859
You were certainly in yours.

453
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:58,733
I'm, uh, just a civilian now.

454
00:25:58,739 --> 00:25:59,981
Yeah, of course, of course.

455
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:01,469
I mean, don't worry.

456
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:03,376
I'll keep your secret.

457
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:05,812
Now you owe me one.

458
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:12,960
These are from a
recently unearthed tomb.

459
00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:14,009
Oh.

460
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:16,250
Have you ever heard
of Antony and Cleopatra?

461
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:19,225
Wow. I was looking for something
a little more elegant,

462
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:21,532
a little less cursed.

463
00:26:21,662 --> 00:26:23,930
Well, I'm not the superstitious type.

464
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:26,032
But if these aren't your style,

465
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,534
I do have a few other, larger items

466
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:30,603
that are not on display.

467
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:31,776
Hmm.

468
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:34,217
The collection is extensive.

469
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,195
Let me know when something...

470
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:39,151
... catches your fancy.

471
00:26:39,157 --> 00:26:40,524
Lovely.

472
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,177
You know, on second thought,

473
00:26:43,183 --> 00:26:46,519
maybe I will go with one of these.

474
00:26:46,587 --> 00:26:49,722
Antony and Cleopatra does
say "bedroom," doesn't it?

475
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:52,588
Exactly what I've been thinking.

476
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:56,834
- God...
- Oh! I am so, so sorry.

477
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,398
Ah... Honest mistake. I was
distracted by the Degas.

478
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:01,806
You have done quite enough, thank you.

479
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:04,919
Thank you. Sorry.

480
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:20,653
Where were we?

481
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,288
Getting to know each other.

482
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:24,957
In fact, I have a question for you.

483
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:28,728
Who do you work for?

484
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,453
How did you get a gun in here?

485
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:37,737
That is not what you should
be worried about right now.

486
00:27:38,975 --> 00:27:42,108
You and I are going to go
someplace private to talk.

487
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:44,277
Pack it up. We're leaving, now.

488
00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:57,362
Polizia!

489
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:01,224
Nobody move!

490
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:34,126
Danny!

491
00:28:34,194 --> 00:28:36,996
Gwen. Hey. How's it going?

492
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:38,331
What are you doing here?

493
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:40,533
Oh, I, uh, I... you know...

494
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:42,568
... it's funny, actually...

495
00:28:45,315 --> 00:28:47,401
You know, I should really
let you get back to it.

496
00:28:47,407 --> 00:28:48,741
You're doing good work.

497
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:02,511
Now, for the last time,
who do you work for?

498
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:04,552
She works for me.

499
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:10,029
I don't work for you.

500
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:11,864
You're welcome.

501
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:14,233
Huh. Took you long enough.

502
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:17,503
It was kind of chaotic in there.

503
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:19,121
And perfect timing for Interpol

504
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:20,422
to show up, don't you think?

505
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:21,440
Yes.

506
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,943
- I texted Gwen.
- Oh, I knew it.

507
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:25,339
You just couldn't help
yourself, could you?

508
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:26,712
You had to call the police,

509
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:29,113
because you're so
unbelievably predictable.

510
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,050
We're lucky they were close by.

511
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:32,656
- You needed the help.
- Help?

512
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:33,996
I was handling it.

513
00:29:34,002 --> 00:29:36,422
Now the Mob knows we
tipped off the authorities.

514
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:38,654
I sent the text from Shaw's phone.

515
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,498
Huh.

516
00:29:42,362 --> 00:29:45,364
Was Gwen the Victoria's Secret
model with the shotgun?

517
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,522
She may have done some modeling
to put herself through school.

518
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:49,928
Huh.

519
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,321
What... hey.

520
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,878
Lexi? What... What are you doing?

521
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:01,379
Oh, no!

522
00:30:02,487 --> 00:30:04,059
You got to be kidding me.

523
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:05,992
Oh, my...

524
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:10,925
Okay.

525
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,559
I need you to tie Shaw up,

526
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:16,329
get him in the trunk while
I hot-wire this thing.

527
00:30:16,396 --> 00:30:17,797
What?

528
00:30:17,803 --> 00:30:19,170
I'm wearing a stolen suit,

529
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:21,110
colluding with the Mob

530
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:23,230
and now we've moved on to
grand theft auto and kidnapping?

531
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:24,904
Well, you're the one who came to me,

532
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:27,139
the criminal, remember?

533
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:28,703
Now, do you want to stay
here and get arrested

534
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:31,017
or get in the damn car and
save your friend Castillo?

535
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:36,291
Fine. But I'm leaving a note.

536
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,114
Reza Vaziri?

537
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:51,050
Agent Daniel McNamara.

538
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:53,619
FBI. Do you have a minute?

539
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,254
What is this about?

540
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:02,695
Be better if we came in, sir.

541
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:04,773
There is nothing to say, sir.

542
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:07,240
She made it clear years ago,

543
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:09,136
this is the life she wanted for herself

544
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:11,538
and I am done trying to
keep her out of jail.

545
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:14,908
I understand, sir, but
this is a sensitive matter.

546
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:16,743
We can't talk in the street.

547
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:18,529
Baba,

548
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:21,471
can we please come in?

549
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,184
You have every right to be mad at me.

550
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,557
- I never listened.
- You never...

551
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:37,120
- You...
- Always getting into trouble.

552
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:38,735
Stop saying things I want to say.

553
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:40,776
I'm just trying to
show you I understand.

554
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,274
And that this time

555
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,255
it's different, I promise.

556
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:45,990
I'm trying to do something good.

557
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,675
I mean, I-I did do something bad,

558
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:52,245
but I'm doing something
good now if you'll help me.

559
00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:54,479
What is it?

560
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:58,725
The FBI, they want to
use your antique shop

561
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:00,662
to set up a sting operation

562
00:32:00,897 --> 00:32:02,406
on Karim Farouk.

563
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:04,824
The terrorist?

564
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,898
We can stop him.

565
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:08,995
I get a chance to start over.

566
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:11,531
A clean slate, you and me.

567
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:17,255
Please.

568
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:19,172
I will hear this man out.

569
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,974
Thank you.

570
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:43,997
Farouk is on the line.

571
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,915
Operation is a go.

572
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:49,702
Predator 138, move to
quadrant Echo Charlie.

573
00:32:50,277 --> 00:32:52,433
Stand by for holding and confirmation.

574
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,253
Farouk's location is confirmed.

575
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,493
Middle vehicle.

576
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,090
Tell the task force they're a go.

577
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,201
Keep talking.

578
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:19,827
What happens now?

579
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,835
Well, while your dad
keeps Farouk on the line,

580
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,837
a Blackhawk full of FBI agents

581
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:27,040
and Asim's Egyptian
Commandos is on its way.

582
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:29,042
They'll stop the car
with a bullet through

583
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:31,411
the engine block, the
team fast ropes down,

584
00:33:31,673 --> 00:33:33,140
arrests Farouk.

585
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:37,050
30 seconds to target.

586
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:44,924
Target has deviated
from his current route.

587
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:47,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

588
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:50,203
It can't be.

589
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:52,211
It's like he knows we are coming.

590
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:55,535
Target just crossed over
the border into Libya.

591
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:58,371
Damn!

592
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:01,969
We have to break off pursuit.

593
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:03,776
Wait, why?

594
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:05,432
We have been hunting
Farouk for six months.

595
00:34:05,438 --> 00:34:07,161
- Now we have him.
- We have no jurisdictional

596
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:09,186
agreement to operate in Libya.

597
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:11,122
I can have two Egyptian Ari

598
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:13,224
Force MIGs on station in 90 seconds.

599
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:15,455
- We can call in an air strike.
- That's...

600
00:34:15,461 --> 00:34:17,452
That's an act of war.

601
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,292
He has killed hundreds of my people.

602
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,827
Yours, too.

603
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,395
We are already at war.

604
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:24,430
You launch a missile
that close to the market

605
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:27,338
and miss, we'll kill a
hundred more innocent people.

606
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:29,668
I am in charge of the Egyptian
end of this operation.

607
00:34:29,988 --> 00:34:31,738
I don't need your permission.

608
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:34,474
Asim, we'll get another chance at him.

609
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:40,012
Do not engage. Do not engage.

610
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,686
He hang up with me.

611
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:43,707
Farouk suspected something.

612
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:45,985
Danny?

613
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,887
I hope you're right.

614
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:51,524
For his sake.

615
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,292
Danny.

616
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,294
It's gonna be okay.

617
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:57,471
We're gonna get this guy.

618
00:34:57,477 --> 00:34:59,098
And we'll keep you safe.

619
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,845
Believe in curses now?

620
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:47,346
I'd like to speak to my lawyer.

621
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:49,315
Does this look like a police station?

622
00:35:49,383 --> 00:35:50,817
We know you're selling the treasure

623
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:52,318
for whoever bombed the pyramid.

624
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:54,210
You're gonna tell us
who you're working for.

625
00:35:54,216 --> 00:35:57,051
I have nothing to say to either of you.

626
00:35:57,596 --> 00:35:59,754
What are you doing?

627
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,993
I'm gonna stick this in your knee.

628
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:02,623
See if that gets you talking.

629
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:03,966
Torture doesn't work.

630
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:05,376
Oh, I'm willing to roll the dice.

631
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:07,338
He's gonna say anything
to get you to stop.

632
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:09,535
It's not gonna help
us find Dr. Castillo.

633
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:12,405
You haven't learned a
damn thing since Farouk.

634
00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:14,836
What does Farouk have to do with this?

635
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,242
You let him get away.

636
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:17,615
I didn't have a choice.

637
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:19,679
Thank God the Egyptians killed him

638
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,714
because you're so great at tracking down

639
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,287
the bad guys, but you refuse to do

640
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:24,784
what you have to do to stop them.

641
00:36:25,398 --> 00:36:26,931
Hey.

642
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,792
Interesting.

643
00:36:32,798 --> 00:36:35,366
I reached out to my friend in the SAS.

644
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:38,197
Aiden Shaw's convoy was hit by

645
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:40,533
a roadside bomb in Tikrit in 2010

646
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:43,202
on the same day an
American contractor named

647
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,038
Dwayne Coleman disappeared.

648
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:48,909
Looks a lot like you.

649
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,043
You stole a dead man's identity...

650
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:53,312
Dwayne.

651
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,815
So... you're a forgery

652
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:57,154
of a bad-ass.

653
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,863
Suddenly you make a lot more sense.

654
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:00,790
I saw a business opportunity.

655
00:37:00,796 --> 00:37:02,259
And I made it work.

656
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:04,619
Don't think I'm a bad-ass?
Go ahead, try me.

657
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,292
Is Dr. Castillo alive?

658
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,261
I-I have no idea who that is.

659
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,390
Then who hired you?

660
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,558
I never met him.

661
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:11,998
I get instructions via text

662
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:14,161
- and paid through middlemen.
- Feel free to tag me in.

663
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,669
Look, my partners grabbed all the loot.

664
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,971
If I don't return it, I'm dead.

665
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,340
If I return everything
to the guys who hired me,

666
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,009
they'll still pay me half my fee.

667
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:24,944
- How?
- When I reach out to them

668
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,884
with an authentication code,

669
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,824
they'll give me a rendezvous point.

670
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,750
I'll send it to you.

671
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:32,818
Mm, it's a nice try.

672
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:34,654
You're gonna reach out to them now.

673
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:39,482
This is how I make my living.

674
00:37:39,488 --> 00:37:42,223
I don't ask you to do
whatever it is you do for free.

675
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,173
How much?

676
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,099
Uh, making enemies is expensive.

677
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:48,301
Oh, my God.

678
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,614
I'll need a new identity,
there's moving costs, I may never

679
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,928
get to see my favorite bar
again, that's a hard thing...

680
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:54,735
Please, please let me stab him.

681
00:37:55,352 --> 00:37:57,176
Let's call it $2 million.

682
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:01,213
All right. I need to make a phone call.

683
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,222
Keep an eye on him.

684
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:05,279
Wait, wait, wait. Man, where you going?

685
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,714
- Don't leave me here with her.
- Oh.

686
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,521
Hold on now, hey, hey.

687
00:38:08,588 --> 00:38:10,156
Hey, hey.

688
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:12,358
Hi, where are you?

689
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:13,960
Just outside of Rome.

690
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,363
I think we're close to
finding Dr. Castillo.

691
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:19,899
But I need some more money
to pay off an arms dealer

692
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,534
who is acting as a middleman.

693
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,336
He wants $2 million.

694
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:25,004
You trust him?

695
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,343
Trust?

696
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,141
No, but... I'm all out of options.

697
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:31,744
All right, fine. U-Uh, text me
the account information.

698
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:33,746
Yeah, will do.

699
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:38,684
Okay, I got the money.

700
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:40,418
Wait.

701
00:38:40,424 --> 00:38:42,191
What?

702
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:47,760
You let Shaw go.

703
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,996
And you gave him the car.

704
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:52,531
I did do that, yeah.

705
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:55,067
But I kept your shield.

706
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:10,325
If anything's missing, just let me know.

707
00:39:10,393 --> 00:39:12,994
So I'm a New Yorker now?

708
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:14,732
Yep.

709
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:16,939
- Screw you!
- Dad.

710
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:18,867
Sorry. I'm trying it out.

711
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:20,430
- You're a natural.
- Oh.

712
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:23,004
Hey, careful with that.

713
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,917
Thank you, Danny.

714
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:32,586
Well, as long as Farouk is out there,

715
00:39:32,654 --> 00:39:34,054
Egypt isn't safe for you.

716
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,908
It's the least we can do.

717
00:39:35,914 --> 00:39:37,345
I mean, thank you

718
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:39,786
for what you have done for my daughter.

719
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,930
Lexi has not always been easy.

720
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:45,399
She lost her mom when
she was younger, and...

721
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:48,902
I think she has been rebelling
against God ever since.

722
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,773
Despite the circumstances of
how you came into her life,

723
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,242
it's been a very good thing for her.

724
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,612
- It's not like that.
- I see...

725
00:39:58,618 --> 00:40:00,385
How you look at each other.

726
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:02,006
- Hmm?
- Okay.

727
00:40:02,012 --> 00:40:03,313
Come on.

728
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,085
Got to meet the broker in ten minutes.

729
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:06,691
Going apartment hunting.

730
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:08,832
I'll see you at dinner.

731
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:26,306
Your dad knows about us.

732
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:28,008
That gonna be a problem for you?

733
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:30,244
Not as long as he doesn't tell the FBI.

734
00:40:32,211 --> 00:40:34,348
I think your secret's safe.

735
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,506
Lexi.

736
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:06,091
No, no.

737
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,409
Dad!

738
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:10,217
Dad... Dad, no!

739
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,720
No.

740
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,201
I trusted you.

741
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:16,841
You said you'd protect us,

742
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:18,792
and I trusted you.

743
00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:21,508
I trusted you.

744
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:36,143
What, what was this?

745
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:38,645
Revenge?

746
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:40,514
For what happened to your father?

747
00:41:41,017 --> 00:41:42,517
You don't think I've replayed

748
00:41:42,523 --> 00:41:44,613
every moment in my head over and over?

749
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:47,087
I was certain they'd get
Farouk another way.

750
00:41:47,155 --> 00:41:48,355
I was wrong.

751
00:41:50,596 --> 00:41:52,397
I found...

752
00:41:52,403 --> 00:41:55,429
... your father's prayer beads
in the debris from the shop.

753
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:59,199
I've carried them with
me every day since.

754
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,723
Keep them.

755
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:26,478
I spent two years

756
00:42:26,484 --> 00:42:28,449
hating you.

757
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:31,765
Only because it was easier
than hating myself.

758
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:39,709
I told Shaw

759
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:42,814
you worked for the government,

760
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:45,112
and that he was going to go
to prison if he didn't run.

761
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:48,644
I said I'd stall you for
a small cut of his profits.

762
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:49,953
If he thinks he's safe,

763
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:51,657
he'll lead us right to them.

764
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,553
What... How? Wh...

765
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:55,656
Fun fact.

766
00:42:55,723 --> 00:42:58,291
This little gadget doesn't
just unlock the phone.

767
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:01,278
It replaces maps app with
an identical program,

768
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:03,219
only mine has a geo tracker

769
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:05,599
that pings me every time
it changes location.

770
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:09,242
Right now, he's heading
south on Via Del Mare.

771
00:43:09,399 --> 00:43:11,078
I'm just giving him
enough of a head start

772
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:12,639
so he doesn't know we're following him.

773
00:43:12,645 --> 00:43:13,991
You knew you were gonna do this

774
00:43:14,116 --> 00:43:15,504
when I went to make that call.

775
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,170
You don't get a guy like Shaw

776
00:43:17,176 --> 00:43:19,811
to do something by giving him
what he wants.

777
00:43:20,074 --> 00:43:22,311
You make him think
he's getting one over on you.

778
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,852
Face it. It's why you needed me, Danny.

779
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:27,292
You knew I would force you

780
00:43:27,298 --> 00:43:29,532
to do whatever it took
to get Castillo back.

781
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,293
All right. Let's go get him.

782
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:22,850
Allah! Allah!

783
00:46:34,632 --> 00:46:35,732
We are too late.

784
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,000
Cleopatra is gone.

785
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:38,301
She is on the truck.

786
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:40,136
We need to find her now.

787
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:45,387
Seal them in.

788
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:48,015
They will serve in the afterlife.

789
00:46:53,132 --> 00:46:54,250
Please.

790
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:01,491
No!

791
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,493
What happened in Rome?

792
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,818
Things got complicated.

793
00:47:19,966 --> 00:47:21,669
Did you bring the originals?

794
00:47:22,246 --> 00:47:24,113
Of course.

795
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:26,583
You think I'd try to
fool you with copies?

796
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,786
My men are unloading the
bigger pieces as we speak.

797
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:31,047
I hope so.

798
00:47:31,053 --> 00:47:32,961
For your sake.

799
00:47:53,777 --> 00:47:55,445
Easy there.

800
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:07,724
My sincere apologies about
the complications in Rome.

801
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:11,456
Dr. Castillo, confirm the
authenticity of the pieces.

802
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:13,417
Sorry I wasn't able to fence

803
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,169
more of the Egyptian artifacts.

804
00:48:15,403 --> 00:48:17,438
If anything is wrong, you're a dead man.

805
00:48:19,403 --> 00:48:23,339
Mr. McNamara... welcome
to the Janus Freeport.

806
00:48:23,407 --> 00:48:25,441
I am the director, Rory Müller.

807
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:26,738
It's very nice to meet you.

808
00:48:26,744 --> 00:48:29,679
This is my executive assistant.

809
00:48:29,747 --> 00:48:32,982
- Pleasure.
- Please. The pleasure is all mine.

810
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,684
Any friends of Mr. Reece...

811
00:48:34,752 --> 00:48:36,152
Well, he's still old school.

812
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,288
Isn't quite sold on using a free port.

813
00:48:38,355 --> 00:48:42,025
Actually, the concept of
a free port is not a new one.

814
00:48:42,092 --> 00:48:43,819
They used to be simple shacks

815
00:48:43,825 --> 00:48:45,433
where items could be held

816
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:47,763
during stops over long voyages

817
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:49,198
to avoid paying taxes.

818
00:48:49,266 --> 00:48:52,635
Only the shack has gotten much nicer.

819
00:48:52,703 --> 00:48:55,171
Please, follow me.

820
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,180
After what happened in Egypt,

821
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,505
Mr. Reece is looking

822
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:02,812
for something absolutely secure.

823
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,615
Think of us like a Swiss bank,

824
00:49:05,683 --> 00:49:09,018
full of tiny Swiss banks.

825
00:49:09,086 --> 00:49:11,461
I'd love to see your ops center.

826
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:15,325
It is normally off-limits
to our clients.

827
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,749
But for Mr. Reece, we'd
be happy to oblige.

828
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:23,869
- It's all authentic.
- Excellent.

829
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:27,303
I'll just take my payment
and be on my way.

830
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:39,682
The-the people that kidnapped
you, what did they look like?

831
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,637
He's nothing special.

832
00:49:41,643 --> 00:49:42,991
She's exotic.

833
00:49:43,388 --> 00:49:45,823
Hair like a model in
a shampoo commercial.

834
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,495
Yes. That's her.

835
00:49:56,404 --> 00:49:58,271
The two people that let you go...

836
00:49:58,402 --> 00:50:01,170
Just showed up at the
front of this building.

837
00:50:01,238 --> 00:50:02,605
You led them right to us.

838
00:50:05,142 --> 00:50:07,502
Crate up the sarcophagus.

839
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:09,078
Leave the rest.

840
00:50:09,146 --> 00:50:10,947
- Chain her up.
- Oh, God!

841
00:50:11,015 --> 00:50:12,406
Ah!

842
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:15,227
Ow...

843
00:50:16,453 --> 00:50:18,230
I need to slow them down.

844
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:26,295
There's constant
surveillance, 24 hours a day,

845
00:50:26,363 --> 00:50:30,133
as well as a video record of
all entries into the vaults.

846
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,869
Do you mind if my girl

847
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:35,577
- takes notes for Mr. Reece?
- Of course not.

848
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:38,700
By all means. Are there cameras
inside the vaults as well?

849
00:50:38,706 --> 00:50:39,924
Oh, no.

850
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:43,379
The only compromise we
make for total privacy

851
00:50:43,447 --> 00:50:45,843
is the safety system, which can

852
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:48,322
sense a fire and extinguish it

853
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:50,420
without harm to property.

854
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:51,766
Is there any concern

855
00:50:51,772 --> 00:50:53,428
about someone hacking the system,

856
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,792
- accessing the video?
- Absolutely not.

857
00:50:56,436 --> 00:50:59,295
It's a closed loop CCTV system.

858
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:01,902
Completely unhackable.

859
00:51:01,908 --> 00:51:04,896
The only way to access this feed is

860
00:51:04,902 --> 00:51:07,170
from inside this room here.

861
00:51:07,237 --> 00:51:09,906
And that would be quite a feat.

862
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,069
Well, Rory,

863
00:51:12,075 --> 00:51:13,945
I'm impressed. Lexi?

864
00:51:13,951 --> 00:51:16,112
Oh, I've got everything I need.

865
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:21,412
Ah, excuse me, sir.

866
00:51:21,884 --> 00:51:24,454
It's a very important message
that needs your attention.

867
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:27,318
Yeah... Rory? Give us a minute.

868
00:51:27,324 --> 00:51:30,159
Meet you upstairs.
We can talk some numbers.

869
00:51:35,332 --> 00:51:37,600
- Yeah?
- Danny...

870
00:51:37,668 --> 00:51:39,102
Is this...

871
00:51:39,169 --> 00:51:41,771
Dr. Castillo. We found her.

872
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,629
- Can you pull up another angle?
- Mm-hmm.

873
00:51:43,635 --> 00:51:45,360
See where they took her?

874
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:46,700
One level down,

875
00:51:46,706 --> 00:51:49,841
vault 22, looks like, she's...

876
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:56,886
That's... Farouk.

877
00:51:58,336 --> 00:52:00,493
You told me they killed him!

878
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:02,099
Lexi!

879
00:52:05,295 --> 00:52:06,629
Lexi!

880
00:52:06,697 --> 00:52:08,131
Lexi!

881
00:52:11,947 --> 00:52:13,814
Lexi!

882
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:16,434
Lexi!

883
00:52:19,947 --> 00:52:22,329
- Danny!
- Hey. Thank God.

884
00:52:22,335 --> 00:52:23,568
Are you okay?

885
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,414
Y-Yeah, yeah. Just get me out of here.

886
00:52:27,475 --> 00:52:29,409
"Bulletproof," my ass.

887
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:32,412
Damn vest was supposed
to be state of the art.

888
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,015
Does it look like state
of the art to you? Oh...

889
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:37,751
This seems like a lot of blood.

890
00:52:45,293 --> 00:52:47,227
Damn it.

891
00:52:58,706 --> 00:53:00,640
Smoke?

892
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:06,235
- Warning.
- Okay.

893
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:07,809
Fire mitigation activated.

894
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:09,716
Exit all vaults.

895
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:11,885
Lot of wood in there, man.
You got to put that out.

896
00:53:11,953 --> 00:53:13,887
Yeah, the system's
gonna put the fire out.

897
00:53:13,955 --> 00:53:16,156
- Oh, good.
- But when it does that,

898
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:18,704
it's gonna suck all the oxygen
out of the room and kill us.

899
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,889
Man, you should've
started with that part.

900
00:53:20,895 --> 00:53:23,627
Warning. Vault door
closing in ten seconds.

901
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,166
- Exit all vaults.
- Here, help me with her.

902
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,405
- No, no, no, no.
- Help! Help! Help!

903
00:53:31,472 --> 00:53:33,907
Oxygen depletion sequence
will begin in 60 seconds.

904
00:53:33,975 --> 00:53:36,592
This door's locked from
the outside. We're trapped.

905
00:53:36,598 --> 00:53:38,612
I've got an idea.

906
00:53:39,032 --> 00:53:40,333
I can do it.

907
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:41,845
It's not the first time I've been shot.

908
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,169
Shouldn't we be trying to call somebody

909
00:53:43,175 --> 00:53:45,309
or find a button that opens the doors?

910
00:53:45,315 --> 00:53:47,650
There's no time, and no way to stop it.

911
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:51,075
Mummies?

912
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,535
Inside this, we'll have an air pocket

913
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:54,008
to survive, until the fire's out

914
00:53:54,014 --> 00:53:55,348
and the oxygen's turned back on.

915
00:53:55,354 --> 00:53:57,040
Are you insane? I'm
not getting in there.

916
00:53:57,046 --> 00:53:58,179
There could be some kind of bacteria

917
00:53:58,185 --> 00:53:59,530
or something that could kill us.

918
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,237
Toxic mold, actually.

919
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:02,572
Lord Carnarvon

920
00:54:02,578 --> 00:54:04,102
is said to have died because of it

921
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:05,949
- after opening King Tut's tomb.
- Okay.

922
00:54:05,955 --> 00:54:07,910
Thus, the speculation of the curse.

923
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,145
Shaw!

924
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:10,802
Live in here or die out there.

925
00:54:10,808 --> 00:54:11,981
Your choice.

926
00:54:11,987 --> 00:54:13,788
Oxygen depletion sequence will begin

927
00:54:13,794 --> 00:54:16,463
in ten, nine,

928
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:19,070
- eight, seven, six...
- Scoot over.

929
00:54:19,076 --> 00:54:22,678
Five... oxygen depletion
sequence activated.

930
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,034
Uh, I think this one just moved.

931
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,375
Nothing moved, Shaw.

932
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:35,346
Just breathe.

933
00:54:36,516 --> 00:54:39,351
I-I'm gonna die of mummy cancer.

934
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,014
Fire extinguished.

935
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:47,417
Oxygen depletion sequence complete.

936
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,385
Ventilation restored.

937
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,588
Get me out of here!

938
00:54:52,594 --> 00:54:54,679
- Oh, careful.
- Oh, ooh... man,

939
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:56,120
I don't like tight spaces.

940
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,294
- You did great.
- Really?

941
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:00,396
- Mostly.
- Thank you... ooh.

942
00:55:00,402 --> 00:55:02,069
I got to find Lexi.

943
00:55:02,075 --> 00:55:03,809
I'll be back.

944
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:09,061
It's nice meeting you.

945
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:19,346
Lexi, where the hell are you?

946
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,677
Gwen. Karim Farouk is still alive.

947
00:57:04,709 --> 00:57:06,638
You need to call Interpol,
liaise with the FBI...

948
00:57:06,644 --> 00:57:08,745
What... what...? What are you doing?

949
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:10,475
You're being remanded into my custody,

950
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:11,768
taken back to Rome.

951
00:57:34,539 --> 00:57:36,973
She was found breaking into a car.

952
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,276
Hitchhiking isn't exactly safe, is it?

953
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:45,015
Castillo okay?

954
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:48,300
Yeah. She's on another plane
in protective custody.

955
00:57:51,686 --> 00:57:53,218
Are you angry at me?

956
00:57:53,224 --> 00:57:56,259
Oh, just a little raw at nearly
being suffocated to death.

957
00:57:56,327 --> 00:57:57,761
If you'd gone after Farouk with me,

958
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:59,162
it wouldn't have been an issue.

959
00:57:59,168 --> 00:58:01,676
Dr. Castillo and Shaw would be dead.

960
00:58:01,682 --> 00:58:04,134
That moron is still alive?

961
00:58:04,202 --> 00:58:06,303
His bulletproof vest
took most of the hit.

962
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,139
He ran off with the rubies
from Cleopatra's headdress.

963
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:11,775
Great. It all worked out, then.

964
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:13,615
You are unbelievable.

965
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:15,267
- You know that?
- You're unbelievable.

966
00:58:15,289 --> 00:58:17,957
If anyone should be mad here, it's me.

967
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,728
You told me Farouk was dead.

968
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:22,753
According to the authorities, he was.

969
00:58:22,759 --> 00:58:25,661
Well, the authorities were wrong, Gwen.

970
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,124
Agent Karlsson.

971
00:58:27,432 --> 00:58:29,396
You worked the Farouk case?

972
00:58:29,402 --> 00:58:31,027
Danny was my Interpol liaison.

973
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:32,729
What's your connection to Farouk?

974
00:58:32,797 --> 00:58:34,364
He killed my father.

975
00:58:34,432 --> 00:58:36,366
After you guys failed to catch him.

976
00:58:37,768 --> 00:58:39,302
Sorry, I didn't know.

977
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:41,433
Lexi, I was told

978
00:58:41,439 --> 00:58:43,673
the Egyptians killed Farouk a year ago.

979
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:45,929
Just shows you, if you want
something done right...

980
00:58:45,935 --> 00:58:47,235
Yeah? How's that going for you?

981
00:59:19,343 --> 00:59:21,878
Aiden Shaw is still alive,

982
00:59:21,946 --> 00:59:24,347
trying to escape Europe.

983
00:59:24,415 --> 00:59:27,184
He knows enough to be a problem.

984
00:59:28,452 --> 00:59:30,387
I'll handle it.

985
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:35,831
I remember him.

986
00:59:36,025 --> 00:59:38,200
He worked for the FBI.

987
00:59:38,262 --> 00:59:40,363
But her...

988
00:59:40,431 --> 00:59:42,158
I don't know.

989
00:59:43,301 --> 00:59:45,235
Find out who she is.

990
00:59:57,288 --> 00:59:58,977
Farouk's MO

991
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:01,551
is stealing treasure to fund terrorism.

992
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:04,154
Now, going after one of the
biggest treasures of all time

993
01:00:04,222 --> 01:00:06,590
means he's planning something big.

994
01:00:06,657 --> 01:00:09,726
It took less than a million
to plan and execute 9/11.

995
01:00:09,794 --> 01:00:11,728
Antony's sarcophagus alone

996
01:00:11,796 --> 01:00:14,097
would be worth a fortune
on the black market.

997
01:00:14,103 --> 01:00:15,937
And now, Farouk has it.

998
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,002
Aiden Shaw was Farouk's fence.

999
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,304
He is our only thread to finding him.

1000
01:00:21,372 --> 01:00:23,006
Cut us loose when we
land, I promise you,

1001
01:00:23,074 --> 01:00:25,228
I will call you the moment we find Shaw.

1002
01:00:25,234 --> 01:00:28,340
Danny, this is now a global
terrorism investigation.

1003
01:00:28,346 --> 01:00:30,874
Every intelligence agency in the world

1004
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,344
is on high alert.

1005
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:34,048
You know I can't just cut you loose.

1006
01:00:34,054 --> 01:00:35,685
Gwen, I can fix this.

1007
01:00:35,753 --> 01:00:37,621
We are so close to finding Farouk.

1008
01:00:37,688 --> 01:00:40,257
Just... get the ball rolling.

1009
01:00:40,324 --> 01:00:43,093
Radio in about Shaw. Have
the Swiss issue a BOLO locally

1010
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,629
and a Red Notice internationally
so he can't get far.

1011
01:00:45,696 --> 01:00:48,265
Think of all the exciting
paperwork you get to file.

1012
01:00:48,332 --> 01:00:49,737
We all want to stop Farouk,

1013
01:00:49,743 --> 01:00:51,194
and every second we waste,

1014
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,204
Shaw gets closer to getting
away forever or being killed.

1015
01:00:54,272 --> 01:00:57,440
Either way, our trail to
follow Farouk gets cold.

1016
01:00:57,508 --> 01:00:58,708
And the next time he pops up,

1017
01:00:58,714 --> 01:01:00,573
he's gonna kill a lot more people.

1018
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:11,116
Bad news.

1019
01:01:11,122 --> 01:01:13,356
There's a couple of Farouk's
guys watching the shop.

1020
01:01:13,424 --> 01:01:15,388
I can't get to your rainy day money.

1021
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,495
What about my rubies?

1022
01:01:18,562 --> 01:01:21,064
Sorry. I can't find a buyer.

1023
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:23,066
Too hot.

1024
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:25,406
Word's out where they came from.

1025
01:01:25,536 --> 01:01:27,182
But I do know a place where

1026
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:29,077
they won't ask any questions,

1027
01:01:29,538 --> 01:01:31,205
if you can get there.

1028
01:01:32,434 --> 01:01:35,168
Okay, when we land,
you and I can figure out

1029
01:01:35,174 --> 01:01:36,908
what to do with Farouk and Shaw.

1030
01:01:36,914 --> 01:01:38,248
As for this one,

1031
01:01:38,254 --> 01:01:39,621
there is a list of agencies

1032
01:01:39,627 --> 01:01:41,946
that wants to talk to
her about past crimes.

1033
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:44,854
Wait until you see how exciting
that paperwork is.

1034
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,160
I'm gonna radio in

1035
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:47,900
a Red Notice request on Shaw.

1036
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:58,099
I thought she'd never leave.

1037
01:01:58,836 --> 01:02:01,738
Look, Red Notice or not,

1038
01:02:01,806 --> 01:02:04,207
I don't trust the police
to work fast enough,

1039
01:02:04,275 --> 01:02:05,863
nor Shaw to keep himself alive

1040
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:07,615
long enough for us to find him.

1041
01:02:07,678 --> 01:02:09,179
And there is no way in hell

1042
01:02:09,246 --> 01:02:12,115
I am letting them ship me off
to some jail in Bahrain.

1043
01:02:12,183 --> 01:02:13,917
What did you do in Bahrain?

1044
01:02:13,923 --> 01:02:15,691
Jordan, Russia, Bahrain...
Any of them...

1045
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:17,999
if I'm on this plane when
it lands, I'm screwed.

1046
01:02:24,795 --> 01:02:26,353
Twist the heel.

1047
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:29,493
A girl can never be too careful.

1048
01:02:31,802 --> 01:02:34,304
Toss it back.

1049
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:35,805
What are you waiting for?

1050
01:02:35,811 --> 01:02:37,412
I've got a pretty loud voice in my head

1051
01:02:37,418 --> 01:02:39,319
telling me this is a terrible idea.

1052
01:02:39,325 --> 01:02:41,144
Oh, you've got to ignore that voice.

1053
01:02:41,212 --> 01:02:42,712
Come on.

1054
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:58,128
So... you with me or not?

1055
01:02:58,195 --> 01:03:00,630
I'm surprised you haven't
already left me behind.

1056
01:03:00,698 --> 01:03:02,599
Farouk has eluded every
government on Earth,

1057
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:05,435
and, apparently, any attempt
to capture or kill him.

1058
01:03:05,441 --> 01:03:07,875
We found him in 48 hours.

1059
01:03:07,881 --> 01:03:09,499
I don't know about you, but I think

1060
01:03:09,505 --> 01:03:10,605
we make a pretty good team.

1061
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:16,375
Hurry, she'll be back any minute.

1062
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:27,357
Now... now we just need a plan.

1063
01:03:27,425 --> 01:03:29,859
Wait, wait, I thought you had a plan.

1064
01:03:29,927 --> 01:03:31,294
I did.

1065
01:03:37,268 --> 01:03:39,469
Hey, hey, they just pulled the flaps.

1066
01:03:39,537 --> 01:03:41,171
Which means we're on
approach to the airport

1067
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:42,806
and below 2,000 feet.

1068
01:03:42,812 --> 01:03:44,031
We can jump.

1069
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:45,375
See?

1070
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:47,610
We already have phase two of the plan.

1071
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:49,150
How hard was that?

1072
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:50,923
Uh, I just found the hard part.

1073
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:54,259
There's only one parachute.

1074
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:58,216
Okay. I'll take it.

1075
01:03:58,222 --> 01:04:01,391
You somehow made that sound noble.

1076
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:02,725
Have you even done this before?

1077
01:04:02,793 --> 01:04:04,477
No, but I'm pretty
sure gravity does most

1078
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:05,967
of the work until you pull the cord.

1079
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,297
You can just hang on to me.

1080
01:04:07,364 --> 01:04:09,332
The FBI put me through jump school,

1081
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,334
and you already left
me for dead once today.

1082
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,170
You can hold on to me.

1083
01:04:13,176 --> 01:04:15,460
How long are you gonna
hold that over my head?

1084
01:04:16,373 --> 01:04:18,675
The Carabinieri's gonna be all over us.

1085
01:04:18,742 --> 01:04:20,919
We need to move quickly
once we hit the ground.

1086
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:33,990
Hold on, I need to make sure
we land in the right place.

1087
01:04:34,058 --> 01:04:36,659
Why are we suddenly doing your plan?

1088
01:04:37,523 --> 01:04:40,336
Because I'm the one with the parachute.

1089
01:05:12,296 --> 01:05:13,396
Great.

1090
01:05:13,464 --> 01:05:15,598
Nice plan.

1091
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,543
Ahem!

1092
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:33,022
Come with me...

1093
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,303
Please.

1094
01:05:37,221 --> 01:05:38,345
Oh...

1095
01:05:39,229 --> 01:05:40,496
Great.

1096
01:05:40,626 --> 01:05:42,193
I can finally scratch "spend a night

1097
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:45,268
"in the Vatican police
station" off my bucket list.

1098
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:47,336
Your friend sure took his time.

1099
01:05:47,404 --> 01:05:49,872
It's not like we called ahead.

1100
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,674
You said he was a professor.

1101
01:05:51,742 --> 01:05:53,109
How's he gonna be able to help us?

1102
01:05:53,176 --> 01:05:54,977
It's just his side gig.

1103
01:05:55,045 --> 01:05:57,658
He also works for the
Vatican's foreign ministry.

1104
01:05:57,664 --> 01:05:59,727
- Huh.
- You know how you could help?

1105
01:05:59,733 --> 01:06:01,434
- Not say anything?
- Hmm.

1106
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:05,379
Please wait there.

1107
01:06:06,986 --> 01:06:08,953
Don't let the uniforms fool you.

1108
01:06:09,081 --> 01:06:10,515
The Swiss Guard are some of

1109
01:06:10,521 --> 01:06:12,356
the most elite soldiers in the world.

1110
01:06:12,362 --> 01:06:15,531
Everyone's laughing
too hard to fight back.

1111
01:06:17,367 --> 01:06:20,670
Monsignor Donnelly
will meet with you now.

1112
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:32,375
They told me that a man

1113
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:34,689
came from the sky

1114
01:06:34,915 --> 01:06:37,550
and asked for me by name.

1115
01:06:40,223 --> 01:06:42,325
Imagine my disappointment.

1116
01:06:45,491 --> 01:06:46,896
Come here.

1117
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:49,363
Come here. Oh...

1118
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:50,949
It's good to see you, Chuck.

1119
01:06:50,955 --> 01:06:53,002
Seriously, what are you doing here?

1120
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:54,870
- It's kind of a long story.
- Yeah? Who are you?

1121
01:06:54,876 --> 01:06:56,424
- Oh, I'm...
- She's just, uh, a friend.

1122
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,774
We're in a bit of a hurry.

1123
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,855
Danny, you can't just
parachute into the Vatican

1124
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:01,339
without expecting a few questions.

1125
01:07:01,345 --> 01:07:03,354
Yes, but it won't take
long for Interpol and

1126
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,102
the Carabinieri to find
out that we're here.

1127
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:07,343
Oh, they found out.
They're at the gate right now.

1128
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:10,181
What? Okay, Chuck, I need
you to hold them off.

1129
01:07:10,187 --> 01:07:11,754
Dude, you are acting crazy.

1130
01:07:11,822 --> 01:07:14,223
You come in here, bringing
a boatload of chaos.

1131
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:16,692
What is going... Oh,
my God, you're Lexi.

1132
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,069
Yeah. So you've heard about me?

1133
01:07:19,075 --> 01:07:20,624
Oh, I've heard a great deal about you.

1134
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:23,199
Chuck, can we talk privately?

1135
01:07:25,502 --> 01:07:27,970
By all means.

1136
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:32,503
- What the hell is going on?
- It's not what it looks like.

1137
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:34,477
It looks like you're getting
mixed up with a criminal

1138
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,540
who's already broken your heart once.

1139
01:07:36,546 --> 01:07:38,547
Okay, it's partially what it looks like.

1140
01:07:38,615 --> 01:07:41,417
Oh, my God, Danny,
how stupid can you be?

1141
01:07:41,485 --> 01:07:44,174
My God, you have got
to be the dumbest...

1142
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,237
Chuck...

1143
01:07:45,243 --> 01:07:47,485
Did I not give you enough
penance last time, is that it?

1144
01:07:47,491 --> 01:07:49,615
Did you want an exorcist?
We got 'em here.

1145
01:07:49,621 --> 01:07:51,122
One of 'em actually owes me a favor...

1146
01:07:51,128 --> 01:07:53,295
Chuck! Farouk's alive.

1147
01:07:53,363 --> 01:07:55,765
He's behind the pyramid attack.

1148
01:07:55,955 --> 01:07:57,356
I thought they droned that guy.

1149
01:07:57,362 --> 01:07:58,896
Yeah, well, apparently it didn't take.

1150
01:07:58,902 --> 01:08:00,340
We we're trying to track him down,

1151
01:08:00,346 --> 01:08:01,764
but we got caught up in some stuff,

1152
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:03,771
and I just don't have
time to sort it all out.

1153
01:08:03,777 --> 01:08:06,504
This is gonna end badly.
She's the devil.

1154
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,511
Will you help me or not?

1155
01:08:08,578 --> 01:08:11,229
None of this is covered under
regular priest-friend rules.

1156
01:08:11,235 --> 01:08:12,275
You know that.

1157
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:13,649
Thank you. Thank you.

1158
01:08:13,717 --> 01:08:15,618
In the meantime, make
sure she steers clear

1159
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,058
of the fountain in the courtyard.

1160
01:08:17,064 --> 01:08:18,782
I don't want the holy water boiling out.

1161
01:08:20,938 --> 01:08:22,853
You know, with the
acoustics in this place,

1162
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:25,361
I could hear everything he just said?

1163
01:08:25,429 --> 01:08:28,064
Look, Chuck sometimes says
stuff he doesn't mean.

1164
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,666
- Hmm.
- I absolutely meant every word.

1165
01:08:34,104 --> 01:08:36,678
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Agent Karlsson, stay calm, eh?

1166
01:08:36,684 --> 01:08:38,285
We're not going to be having a shootout

1167
01:08:38,353 --> 01:08:39,720
in the Sistine Chapel, huh?

1168
01:08:39,787 --> 01:08:41,788
I'm not letting them
hide behind this gate.

1169
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:44,089
Remember, you are a guest in my country.

1170
01:08:44,268 --> 01:08:45,595
Calmati.

1171
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:47,762
Let me handle it, va bene?

1172
01:08:50,265 --> 01:08:52,399
Ci penso io.

1173
01:08:52,467 --> 01:08:55,235
Hi. Monsignor Charles Donnelly.

1174
01:08:55,303 --> 01:08:56,703
Uh, can I be of service?

1175
01:08:56,709 --> 01:08:58,082
- Yes.
- You're American.

1176
01:08:58,088 --> 01:08:59,522
Is the pope Catholic?

1177
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,945
Vatican joke. Sorry.
Uh, yes, I am American.

1178
01:09:04,951 --> 01:09:06,637
- Is that all you needed?
- No.

1179
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,582
- We want to...
- We need to gain entry.

1180
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:10,217
And you are...

1181
01:09:10,223 --> 01:09:12,511
- Agent Gwen Karlsson, Interpol.
- Oh.

1182
01:09:12,722 --> 01:09:15,217
Unfortunately, Interpol
doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1183
01:09:15,223 --> 01:09:18,364
I'm Captain Bruno Fabi
of the Carabinieri,

1184
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:20,689
and I do have jurisdiction here.

1185
01:09:20,695 --> 01:09:22,996
Vatican City is a sovereign city-state,

1186
01:09:23,064 --> 01:09:26,600
and, uh, as such, Italian
authorities do not,

1187
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:29,570
technically, have jurisdiction here.

1188
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:32,306
"The Holy See shall hand
over to the Italian state

1189
01:09:32,312 --> 01:09:35,286
"all persons who may have taken
refuge within Vatican City

1190
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:37,367
"when accused of acts committed
within Italian territory

1191
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:38,840
"which are considered to be criminal

1192
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:40,247
"by the law of both states."

1193
01:09:41,316 --> 01:09:43,116
So you have paperwork

1194
01:09:43,184 --> 01:09:45,419
attesting to the fact that such persons

1195
01:09:45,486 --> 01:09:46,920
are being accused of such acts?

1196
01:09:46,926 --> 01:09:48,760
Okay, we're gonna get the court order,

1197
01:09:48,766 --> 01:09:50,319
- and we will be right back.
- No...

1198
01:09:50,503 --> 01:09:52,604
Sounds great. Have a blessed morning.

1199
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:53,977
She was...

1200
01:09:58,805 --> 01:10:00,662
Sorry I couldn't buy you more time.

1201
01:10:00,668 --> 01:10:02,970
They'll be back any
minute with a warrant.

1202
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:05,232
I guess somebody here knows
how to piss people off.

1203
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:07,474
What about the names
I asked you to run down

1204
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,570
at the foreign ministry?

1205
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:10,611
Yeah, uh, nothing on Aiden Shaw,

1206
01:10:10,617 --> 01:10:12,107
but I did get a hit on the other guy.

1207
01:10:12,113 --> 01:10:13,714
What other guy?

1208
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:16,048
Dwayne Coleman.

1209
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:19,287
Shaw wouldn't be dumb enough
to travel under his real name.

1210
01:10:19,293 --> 01:10:21,216
- Would he?
- He wouldn't have had much time

1211
01:10:21,222 --> 01:10:22,639
to create a new identity.

1212
01:10:22,645 --> 01:10:26,188
Well, Dwayne Coleman entered
Istanbul an hour ago.

1213
01:10:26,317 --> 01:10:29,255
That's perfect. We could
be there in a couple hours.

1214
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:31,895
Uh, are you forgetting
that the Carabinieri

1215
01:10:31,901 --> 01:10:33,667
have this whole city surrounded?

1216
01:10:33,735 --> 01:10:35,535
Not a problem.

1217
01:10:35,603 --> 01:10:38,005
Just need you to take me
to the first floor reading room

1218
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:40,140
of the Apostolic Library.

1219
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:41,808
Why?

1220
01:10:41,876 --> 01:10:45,012
There's a secret escape
tunnel under the Vatican.

1221
01:10:55,616 --> 01:10:57,619
So, did you, uh, learn about

1222
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,027
this secret passageway from that book

1223
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:02,162
where aliens started the church

1224
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:05,959
and left clues all throughout
Europe in plain sight?

1225
01:11:06,468 --> 01:11:08,269
Oh, no, I know, I know.

1226
01:11:08,275 --> 01:11:10,737
It was the one about the Illuminati

1227
01:11:10,805 --> 01:11:12,739
with the conspiracy theory, and...

1228
01:11:12,807 --> 01:11:16,139
"Only one man can stop it!"

1229
01:11:16,844 --> 01:11:20,397
Danny, dude, if there was
a secret passageway in here,

1230
01:11:20,403 --> 01:11:22,215
I would know about it, okay?

1231
01:11:22,283 --> 01:11:24,217
Me and Papa are tight.

1232
01:11:28,589 --> 01:11:31,525
Looks like Papa's been
holding out on you, Chuck.

1233
01:11:32,694 --> 01:11:34,227
Clever.

1234
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:38,132
Hey. Hey, hey, your friend better not

1235
01:11:38,138 --> 01:11:40,639
think about using this
to rob the Vatican!

1236
01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:42,636
Too late!

1237
01:11:53,465 --> 01:11:54,765
Jay.

1238
01:11:54,771 --> 01:11:56,672
Danny. You okay, kid?

1239
01:11:56,678 --> 01:11:58,880
Yeah. The less I tell you, the better.

1240
01:11:58,886 --> 01:12:00,549
Considering why I'm calling.

1241
01:12:00,555 --> 01:12:02,989
I know. Farouk's alive.

1242
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:05,659
Just tell me you're not
going after him on your own.

1243
01:12:05,727 --> 01:12:07,060
We found him yesterday.

1244
01:12:07,128 --> 01:12:09,930
He got away, but now we've got a lead.

1245
01:12:09,936 --> 01:12:11,493
I just need to borrow your jet again.

1246
01:12:11,499 --> 01:12:12,740
What if I said no?

1247
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:14,614
I mean, not without my security detail.

1248
01:12:14,742 --> 01:12:16,075
I'd tell you I'm going anyway,

1249
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,894
and I don't have any time to waste.

1250
01:12:19,107 --> 01:12:20,714
All right. I'll make sure the

1251
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,581
jet's waiting for you at Ciampino.

1252
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:24,206
You still with the girl?

1253
01:12:24,212 --> 01:12:27,748
Yeah, yeah, we're in it
until we stop Farouk.

1254
01:12:27,754 --> 01:12:29,076
I owe it to her.

1255
01:12:29,082 --> 01:12:30,412
I hope you know what you're doing.

1256
01:12:30,418 --> 01:12:31,418
I'll keep you posted.

1257
01:12:31,424 --> 01:12:32,518
Thanks, Jay.

1258
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:35,789
I'm so hungry. Want a bite?

1259
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:38,258
Reece's plane is waiting
to take us to Istanbul.

1260
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:40,827
Now we just need to figure out where.

1261
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,534
There's only one place in the area where

1262
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,059
he could unload Cleopatra's rubies,

1263
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:46,933
no questions asked: the Byzantia Casino.

1264
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:48,201
Never heard of it.

1265
01:12:48,269 --> 01:12:49,803
It's more my crowd than yours.

1266
01:12:49,871 --> 01:12:51,171
Place is on the Black Sea.

1267
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:53,039
It accepts any high-value
items as collateral.

1268
01:12:53,107 --> 01:12:55,175
Rubies for casino chips.

1269
01:12:55,243 --> 01:12:57,344
Try to double your money
while laundering it.

1270
01:12:57,730 --> 01:12:59,130
Smart for the casino, at least.

1271
01:12:59,136 --> 01:13:01,443
Personally, I'd cash out immediately,

1272
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:03,790
but I bet Shaw thinks
he can beat the house.

1273
01:13:05,386 --> 01:13:07,687
You got sandwich all over your face.

1274
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:17,998
Shaw has been spotted in Istanbul.

1275
01:13:18,613 --> 01:13:22,369
The American and the girl
appear to be following him.

1276
01:13:22,437 --> 01:13:25,472
We have assets near
the border we can send.

1277
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,874
No, I-I don't want to
draw unnecessary attention

1278
01:13:27,942 --> 01:13:29,376
with a lot of gunfire.

1279
01:13:30,767 --> 01:13:32,307
Send in the Scorpion.

1280
01:13:34,032 --> 01:13:35,900
Kill them all.

1281
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,267
Dr. Castillo.

1282
01:13:46,732 --> 01:13:49,765
Sorry about all the
security; not my choice.

1283
01:13:49,999 --> 01:13:52,740
The minute Reece found out
that Farouk was alive,

1284
01:13:52,746 --> 01:13:54,757
his security force descended upon me.

1285
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:58,046
I'm Captain Bruno Fabi
of the Carabinieri TPC.

1286
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,872
We're responsible for combating
art and antiquities crimes.

1287
01:14:00,878 --> 01:14:02,936
I've already told Interpol
everything that I know.

1288
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:04,876
I apologize for the inconvenience,

1289
01:14:04,882 --> 01:14:06,022
but we have lost the two

1290
01:14:06,028 --> 01:14:07,305
people we had in custody.

1291
01:14:07,311 --> 01:14:09,047
Did something happen to Danny?

1292
01:14:09,053 --> 01:14:11,055
Danny and Lexi Vaziri
broke out of custody.

1293
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:13,651
Thank God.

1294
01:14:13,719 --> 01:14:15,553
You had me worried there for a minute.

1295
01:14:15,559 --> 01:14:17,033
You don't happen to know where they are?

1296
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:18,978
They're probably looking
for Karim Farouk,

1297
01:14:18,984 --> 01:14:20,351
which is what you should be doing

1298
01:14:20,357 --> 01:14:21,524
instead of bothering them.

1299
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:23,049
Who knows about the tomb of Antony

1300
01:14:23,055 --> 01:14:24,495
being inside of the pyramid?

1301
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,117
Me, my whole team...

1302
01:14:26,123 --> 01:14:27,276
Who are all dead...

1303
01:14:27,282 --> 01:14:28,621
The terrorists, of course,

1304
01:14:28,627 --> 01:14:30,423
Danny McNamara and Jay Reece,

1305
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:31,796
who funded the expedition.

1306
01:14:31,864 --> 01:14:33,765
We should keep it that way for now.

1307
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,834
We are trying to avoid a media circus.

1308
01:14:35,901 --> 01:14:37,969
I totally agree. Although, there is that

1309
01:14:38,005 --> 01:14:40,673
little fact that the Nazis
may have taken Cleopatra

1310
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:43,571
75 years ago and that
might cause quite a stir.

1311
01:14:43,577 --> 01:14:44,610
Wait, what?

1312
01:14:44,616 --> 01:14:46,327
There was a dead body in the tomb,

1313
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,531
a German, Nazi Afrika Corps.

1314
01:14:48,537 --> 01:14:51,033
- They must've taken her.
- That wasn't in the notes.

1315
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:52,189
She didn't tell me about it.

1316
01:14:52,195 --> 01:14:53,595
I really don't see how it relates

1317
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:55,704
to a current terror investigation.

1318
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,248
What's this?

1319
01:15:00,254 --> 01:15:02,689
Oh, that was found in
the dead Nazi's hand.

1320
01:15:02,695 --> 01:15:04,729
On the one side, it's
an inscription, "VICI."

1321
01:15:04,735 --> 01:15:07,361
Haven't quite figured out
what that one means yet.

1322
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:10,135
On the other, it's an
Ancient Greek Serapis.

1323
01:15:10,202 --> 01:15:12,704
I'm very sorry, but this is evidence.

1324
01:15:12,771 --> 01:15:15,039
- We need to examine it.
- Absolutely.

1325
01:15:15,107 --> 01:15:17,308
I have no more questions, Doctor.

1326
01:15:17,314 --> 01:15:19,415
The Carabinieri thank you
for your continued help

1327
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,555
with the investigation.

1328
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:54,045
Isn't it weird that a
tiny part of me hopes

1329
01:15:54,051 --> 01:15:55,734
we have Shaw all wrong,

1330
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:58,175
and he was smart enough
to just keep going?

1331
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:00,027
Blackjack!

1332
01:16:00,033 --> 01:16:03,035
You are so cute.

1333
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:12,697
Darling, I'd love another Vesper.

1334
01:16:12,765 --> 01:16:14,599
- Evening.
- Crap.

1335
01:16:14,605 --> 01:16:15,905
May we join you?

1336
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:17,745
The gentleman's
requested a private game.

1337
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:19,869
No, we're old friends.

1338
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,986
He's got no secrets from us.

1339
01:16:24,043 --> 01:16:27,245
- Where did you get all that cash?
- Reece's card.

1340
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:29,285
I took it from your wallet
while you were changing.

1341
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:30,624
How did you know the PIN?

1342
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:32,230
Oh, you know, one of my little toys.

1343
01:16:32,272 --> 01:16:33,929
The same guy who made my PIN descrambler

1344
01:16:33,935 --> 01:16:35,302
also made the geo tracker app

1345
01:16:35,308 --> 01:16:37,157
I put on Shaw's phone back in Rome.

1346
01:16:37,163 --> 01:16:39,464
So that's how you found
me in Switzerland,

1347
01:16:40,002 --> 01:16:41,733
you violated my privacy.

1348
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:43,135
I saved your life,

1349
01:16:43,202 --> 01:16:45,137
and you ran five minutes later

1350
01:16:45,204 --> 01:16:47,539
with a pocket full of stolen rubies.

1351
01:16:47,607 --> 01:16:49,875
No, you two got me shot.

1352
01:16:49,942 --> 01:16:52,310
I thought the rubies were
a fair consolation prize.

1353
01:16:52,378 --> 01:16:55,247
Unfortunately, harder
to liquidate than I expected.

1354
01:16:55,314 --> 01:16:57,482
Well, your life is still in danger.

1355
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:59,084
We need to get out of here.

1356
01:16:59,152 --> 01:17:01,386
Relax, they won't make
a move on me in public

1357
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:02,869
surrounded by cameras.

1358
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:05,062
I'm as safe as I can be in here.

1359
01:17:05,124 --> 01:17:07,292
And I've nearly doubled my money.

1360
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,428
Blackjack.

1361
01:17:09,495 --> 01:17:11,724
You see, sometimes in life

1362
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:14,171
you have to make your own luck.

1363
01:17:19,138 --> 01:17:21,440
Doesn't seem like a heart attack.

1364
01:17:21,507 --> 01:17:23,241
He's sweating buckets.

1365
01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:25,444
Yeah, me, too.

1366
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:27,186
Me, too.

1367
01:17:28,073 --> 01:17:29,536
Wait...

1368
01:17:30,789 --> 01:17:32,510
The chips.

1369
01:17:32,516 --> 01:17:34,155
Danny, they're poisoned.

1370
01:17:34,161 --> 01:17:36,095
The dealer.

1371
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:43,330
You get out.

1372
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,497
What'd you poison us with?

1373
01:17:45,503 --> 01:17:46,770
Give us the antidote.

1374
01:18:02,215 --> 01:18:04,783
Danny, I'm seeing two of them.

1375
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:06,518
Go for the one on the left.

1376
01:18:18,701 --> 01:18:20,269
Hurry.

1377
01:18:33,049 --> 01:18:34,965
Thanks...

1378
01:18:36,782 --> 01:18:39,885
For unpoisoning me first.

1379
01:18:39,952 --> 01:18:43,155
Thanks for not leaving me behind again.

1380
01:18:48,161 --> 01:18:49,928
Oh...

1381
01:18:49,996 --> 01:18:51,363
Shaw!

1382
01:18:56,718 --> 01:19:00,718
Shot, poisoned, mummied?

1383
01:19:01,476 --> 01:19:03,608
- I'm telling you, I'm cursed.
- Hey,

1384
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:06,444
don't let anybody touch that
table. It's covered in poison.

1385
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,803
And we should probably get
out of here before the police

1386
01:19:08,809 --> 01:19:11,151
- or another assassin arrives.
- Are you okay?

1387
01:19:11,157 --> 01:19:13,885
Suddenly you realize
just how short life is.

1388
01:19:14,135 --> 01:19:16,020
You just want to find somebody special

1389
01:19:16,026 --> 01:19:17,560
to spend that time with, you know?

1390
01:19:17,566 --> 01:19:19,323
- Come on, Romeo.
- Let me get her number.

1391
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:20,776
Who knows how much time I got left?

1392
01:19:20,782 --> 01:19:22,416
Why don't you tell us
where to find Farouk

1393
01:19:22,422 --> 01:19:23,807
before we feed you those chips?

1394
01:19:23,813 --> 01:19:25,781
All I know is how he was gonna pay me,

1395
01:19:25,787 --> 01:19:29,357
and I'll happily tell you as
soon as I have an immunity deal.

1396
01:19:42,795 --> 01:19:43,861
- Hey.
- Hey.

1397
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:45,496
Thank God.

1398
01:19:45,502 --> 01:19:47,603
Shaw's in custody,
getting medical treatment.

1399
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:49,239
We didn't get much out of him.

1400
01:19:49,245 --> 01:19:51,335
Upside, we're no longer
international fugitives.

1401
01:19:51,341 --> 01:19:52,733
Downside, we can't leave the EU

1402
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:54,079
without permission from Interpol.

1403
01:19:54,085 --> 01:19:55,802
Well, good luck with that.

1404
01:19:55,932 --> 01:19:57,332
I'm going after Farouk

1405
01:19:57,338 --> 01:19:59,739
wherever that takes me, and Gwen...

1406
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:01,202
Gwen can suck it.

1407
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:03,247
What're you researching?

1408
01:20:03,253 --> 01:20:05,190
Teutonic occultism.

1409
01:20:05,196 --> 01:20:07,213
There were dead Nazis in the tomb.

1410
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,600
Seriously?

1411
01:20:08,606 --> 01:20:10,607
I think that they took Cleopatra.

1412
01:20:10,613 --> 01:20:13,181
I am just trying to figure out why.

1413
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:16,146
Well, the Nazis believed
that some sacred objects

1414
01:20:16,213 --> 01:20:18,648
held actual power, like the Holy Grail,

1415
01:20:18,654 --> 01:20:20,655
Spear of Destiny. I mean,

1416
01:20:20,661 --> 01:20:22,194
maybe they thought Cleopatra did.

1417
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,948
Well, if they believed
in the supernatural,

1418
01:20:23,954 --> 01:20:25,321
then wouldn't they believe in the curse

1419
01:20:25,327 --> 01:20:27,061
if they disturbed her tomb?

1420
01:20:27,067 --> 01:20:29,769
What if they were trying
to weaponize that?

1421
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,662
Turn an artifact into a
weapon of mass destruction.

1422
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:34,230
Like that old movie.

1423
01:20:34,298 --> 01:20:36,599
- Indiana Jones.
- Maybe?

1424
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:38,935
Really? You two used to date?

1425
01:20:38,941 --> 01:20:40,465
But none of this explains what Farouk

1426
01:20:40,471 --> 01:20:42,472
actually wanted Cleopatra for.

1427
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:46,109
Look, Farouk left everything
from Cleopatra's tomb

1428
01:20:46,177 --> 01:20:48,739
at the free port, but what did he take?

1429
01:20:50,514 --> 01:20:53,889
The heaviest and hardest thing
to move, Antony's sarcophagus.

1430
01:20:53,895 --> 01:20:56,372
Well, you said yourself, it's
worth its weight in gold.

1431
01:20:56,378 --> 01:20:58,588
Yeah, but I'm starting to think
it might be more than that.

1432
01:20:58,594 --> 01:21:00,485
I mean, he kept Dr. Castillo alive. Why?

1433
01:21:00,491 --> 01:21:02,682
She's an expert on Cleopatra.

1434
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:05,930
What if he wants to reunite
Cleopatra with Antony?

1435
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:10,000
We find Cleopatra, we'll find Farouk.

1436
01:21:10,006 --> 01:21:11,794
And I'll be at Shaw's
bedside threatening him

1437
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,567
with a rusty catheter
if he doesn't talk.

1438
01:21:13,573 --> 01:21:15,205
And I'll be right there
with you keeping you

1439
01:21:15,211 --> 01:21:16,562
from violating the Geneva Conventions,

1440
01:21:16,568 --> 01:21:18,002
but in the meantime...

1441
01:21:18,008 --> 01:21:19,605
We have to find Cleopatra.
Danny's right.

1442
01:21:19,611 --> 01:21:22,346
No one who has been looking
for her in the two millennia

1443
01:21:22,352 --> 01:21:25,588
knew exactly where to start,
but we know exactly

1444
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:27,294
where she was 70 years ago.

1445
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:28,680
As does Farouk.

1446
01:21:28,686 --> 01:21:30,316
Hmm-mm. I have something
that he doesn't.

1447
01:21:30,322 --> 01:21:31,581
What is that?

1448
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:34,390
I think it's the key
to finding Cleopatra.

1449
01:21:34,458 --> 01:21:36,159
The medallion says "Serapis,"

1450
01:21:36,227 --> 01:21:37,894
a deity that had a cult of followers

1451
01:21:37,962 --> 01:21:40,730
in the time of Cleopatra.
The cult was presumed

1452
01:21:40,798 --> 01:21:43,333
to have died out after
Rome conquered Egypt.

1453
01:21:45,035 --> 01:21:48,181
But if that's true, then
what was this medallion

1454
01:21:48,187 --> 01:21:51,541
doing in the hands of a
dead Nazi in the 1940s?

1455
01:21:51,547 --> 01:21:53,571
I believe whoever killed those Nazis

1456
01:21:53,577 --> 01:21:55,273
is the same group that moved Antony

1457
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:58,081
and Cleopatra into the
pyramid in the first place.

1458
01:21:58,149 --> 01:21:59,625
Fabi, what have you learned

1459
01:21:59,631 --> 01:22:01,489
about the American and the girl?

1460
01:22:01,552 --> 01:22:03,911
Resourceful, driven,

1461
01:22:04,722 --> 01:22:07,357
worthy adversaries in the hunt.

1462
01:22:07,363 --> 01:22:09,175
If they get in our way,

1463
01:22:09,181 --> 01:22:12,550
it will be up to you
to deal with them both.

1464
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,534
They must be her protectors,

1465
01:22:17,663 --> 01:22:19,097
and if they are still

1466
01:22:19,103 --> 01:22:21,371
around today, then they are the key

1467
01:22:21,438 --> 01:22:25,041
to finding Cleopatra
and stopping Farouk.
