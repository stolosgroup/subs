166
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,781
Well, the last time I saw him,

167
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,048
I was around 8 years old.

168
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,149
He was the first Stivick

169
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,918
to come over from
Poland to America.

170
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,152
He made it big here

171
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,154
and he sent money for
my father to come over.

172
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,524
Ain't that interesting, Archie?

173
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,260
If it wasn't for his Uncle Alex,

174
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,018
Mike would be in
Poland right now.

175
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,043
Out of respect for the dead,
I ain't going to say nothing.

176
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,881
Michael, this check
is only for $275.

177
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,015
Yeah, well, it explains here

178
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,383
that they took
out the difference

179
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,751
to recover my
uncle's back taxes.

180
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,919
Oh.

181
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,821
Gee, almost half.
I don't believe it.

182
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:25,955
Wow.

183
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,924
I never thought I'd
live to see the day

184
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,526
when the meathead
would have a tax problem.

185
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,327
See, that's the difference

186
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,762
between you and me, Arch.

187
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,331
I don't mind paying taxes
if I know that the money's

188
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,866
going to be used
for good things.

189
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,335
But do you know what Nixon's
going to do with my money?

190
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,270
He's going to use
it to buy a bomb

191
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,505
and blow up a
Vietnamese village.

192
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,807
That's for your
protection, buddy.

193
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:44,974
You want them gooks

194
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,198
riding the subways with you?

195
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,413
That's right, Arch.

196
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,014
That's every Oriental's dream,

197
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,319
to ride the I.R.T.

198
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,455
Michael, $275 is a lot of money.

199
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,890
Are we going to
save it or spend it?

200
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,225
Well, I don't know. I
got to think about it.

201
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,461
Uh, yeah, well,

202
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,228
maybe I could help
you with that problem.

203
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,164
Why don't you look around, see?

204
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,322
And find out if you
owe anybody anything.

205
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,927
And then pay that person.

206
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,276
I don't owe anybody, Arch.

207
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,580
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

208
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,314
What about your landlord,

209
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,484
which happens to be I?

210
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,085
What about living here free,

211
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,720
room and board, for two years?

212
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,154
Not to mention the depreciation

213
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,023
on your bedroom up there.

214
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,625
Arch, I've been keeping a record

215
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,893
of every penny I owe you,

216
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,528
but don't you remember the deal?

217
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,096
I stay here till I finish school

218
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,631
and get a job,

219
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,833
and then I'll pay you
back, with interest.

220
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,001
By the time that happens,

221
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,345
I'll be rooming with
your Uncle Alex.

222
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,240
Look, Arch...

223
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,409
Arch, believe me, if there
was an emergency here,

224
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,644
I'd give you this check

225
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,879
without thinking twice about it,

226
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,113
but right now,

227
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,181
I'd like to use the money
for something special.

228
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,550
Something special? What?

229
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01,718
Well, like, uh...

230
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:02,952
Like getting Gloria

231
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,153
that winter coat
she's been needing.

232
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,154
Oh, Michael, really?

233
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,155
Yeah.

234
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,390
Oh, thank you, honey.

235
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,925
Oh, beautiful,
beautiful. A winter coat.

236
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,326
How much is that going to take?

237
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,327
I don't know. How much?

238
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,328
Uh, around $80.

239
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,396
$80.

240
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,931
Well, all right,

241
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,500
what are you going to do with
the other 'round about $200?

242
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,835
Well, that I'd like to use

243
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,202
for something really important.

244
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,971
Like what?

245
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,035
Like giving it to the
McGovern campaign.

246
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,616
Are you kidding me?

247
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,084
No, I'm not kidding, Arch.

248
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,153
There's a real
emergency. Don't you see?

249
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,022
The election's only
two weeks away

250
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,857
and they need the
money desperately.

251
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:41,925
Do you mean to say

252
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,693
that you'd give
$200 to them people

253
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,828
and forget all about
your own family here?

254
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,463
Arch, I'm doing
it for my family,

255
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,999
because I want to keep
us living in a democracy.

256
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,768
What the hell are
you talking about?

257
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,402
I'm talking about the fact

258
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,804
that the Republicans
have over $30 million,

259
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,606
while the Democrats
had to put on a telethon

260
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,007
just to keep their
heads above water.

261
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,475
Your head is under water!

262
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,610
You hear this guy, Gloria?

263
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,111
Are you gonna stand there?

264
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,512
You hear what your
husband is saying?

265
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,948
You're going to let him do that?

266
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:05,982
Why not?

267
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,183
Arch, don't you see?

268
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,451
The party with the money

269
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,186
can afford to buy
TV and radio time

270
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,021
to get their message
across to the people.

271
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,890
The other party
doesn't stand a chance!

272
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,124
Before you know it,

273
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,425
you've lost the
two-party system.

274
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,461
Gee, it's getting like
politics in America

275
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,662
is only for the rich.

276
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,198
Who's been feeding
you that commie crapola?

277
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,434
President Eisenhower said that.

278
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,769
He did not!

279
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,270
Eisenhower was a great president

280
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,228
who never said nothing.

281
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,080
He did too, Daddy.

282
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,582
Eisenhower made
that statement in 1968.

283
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,718
I saw it in the<i> Reader's Digest.</i>

284
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,909
Oh! I wonder if
they paid him $100.

285
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,391
And I wonder if you

286
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,116
could get the
supper on the table!

287
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,530
$200. I can't believe it.

288
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,766
I can't believe that
you'd give $200

289
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,767
to them McGoverns.

290
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,935
Why not, Arch?

291
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,737
I want to help him get
his message across.

292
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:01,938
I can tell you
McGovern's message

293
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,272
in three words. What?

294
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,874
"I wanna be president."

295
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,342
Message ended.

296
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,011
Well, McGovern
should be president.

297
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,913
Nixon hasn't kept
any of his promises.

298
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,448
He promised to end the war,

299
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,018
to reduce unemployment
and to stop inflation.

300
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:19,789
Don't be picking on a man
over minor details like that!

301
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,791
The American people
don't elect a president

302
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:22,925
over that stuff anyhow.

303
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,393
They don't like a
guy like McGovern,

304
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,595
who's running around
changing his mind all the time.

305
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,466
They want a man like Nixon,
who don't change for nothing.

306
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,036
You're right about that, Arch.

307
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,004
He keeps making
the same mistakes

308
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,140
over and over again.

309
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,374
Listen,

310
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,176
I don't want to hear
nothing more from you,

311
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,011
because you've been
freeloading here off of me

312
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,914
for the last two years, I
ain't said a word. What?!

313
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,015
What are you talking about?

314
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,616
Daddy, you pick
on him all the time!

315
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,985
All you've been
doing is complaining!

316
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,520
Don't run away. Don't
run away from the facts.

317
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,522
For the first time in your
life, a miracle happens.

318
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,692
You get a little lump
of dough in your fist.

319
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,894
You could do the right
thing and give it to me,

320
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,295
but you don't see it that way.

321
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,297
How does anybody
get through to you?

322
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,832
Dinner!

323
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:06,302
Oh, that's how they
get through to him!

324
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,604
Look at him,
running for the chow,

325
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,340
like Rin-Tin-Tin.
Oh, Archie, give it up.

326
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,441
Daddy,

327
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,843
if Michael wants
to give his money

328
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,845
to a worthy cause,
that's his business.

329
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,479
Listen, where's
your family feeling?

330
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,415
You went to Sunday
school, didn't you? Huh?

331
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,817
Try and remember
what the Bible says

332
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:21,984
about charity.

333
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,987
"It's better to give
than to receive."

334
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,989
That's Aesop's fables.

335
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,224
The Good Book says

336
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,059
that charity begins
and ends at home.

337
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,294
Look at him there.
He's eating so fast,

338
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,596
sparks are flying

339
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,598
out of his knife and fork.

340
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,999
I'll eat in the kitchen!

341
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,300
You could eat on the porch.

342
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,103
It's still the food
I paid for, buddy!

343
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,205
Oh, Archie, don't
talk to him like...

344
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,606
And you, my wife,
cooking for him!

345
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,607
I don't mind.

346
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,842
That's going to stop now,

347
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,009
until he starts

348
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,211
chipping in for something.

349
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,345
Well,

350
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,547
if that's the way
you want it, okay.

351
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,482
I'm working, so
I'll pay for the food,

352
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,317
and what's more,
I'll cook for him!

353
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,819
I can, you know. I can cook!

354
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,122
This is your father
you're talking to here.

And in case you're
worried about tonight,

356
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,748
anything we eat, I'll pay for!

357
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,534
You hear your daughter,

358
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,036
turning on her father that way?

359
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,138
22 years,

360
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,240
I never heard her
open her yap like that!

361
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,507
But she's just sticking up

362
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,742
for her husband.

[GROWLS]

364

For the life of me,

365
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,383
I'll never understand women.

366
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,652
The way they marry
some guy who goes

367
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,587
and makes a
damn fool of himself,

368
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,011
but still, they love him.

00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,516
That's right, Archie.

370
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,113
Oh, hi, Gloria.

371
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,914
How was your day?

372
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,349
I don't have time to talk, Ma.

373
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,950
I got to start Michael's dinner.

374
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,654
Oh, dear, I wish we could
all get back to eating together,

the same food

in the same room
at the same time.

Talk to Daddy about that.

378
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,195
Well, I tried to this morning,

00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,897
but he's still mad.

380
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,966
Why are you home
so late, Gloria?

381
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,902
Well, I stopped by
the school to vote

382
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,303
and so did everybody else.

383

You should have seen that line.

384
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,143
Ma, what's your laundry
doing in the refrigerator?

385
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,477
I'm keeping it damp,

386
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,347
because I'm gonna
iron it right after dinner.

387
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,515
Ma, please,

388
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,316
I can't get through
to my vegetables.

All right, Gloria.

You don't have to get so upset!

391
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,623
After all, I'm just as worked up

about the last couple of weeks

393
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,094
as you.

394
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,896
Why didn't you
vote this morning?

395
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,699
Your store gave
you the time off.

396
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,001
Because I wanted to spend
some time with Michael.

397
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,003
I never see him anymore
except dinner time.

Well, why does he have
to run off to the library

every night?

400
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,676
Why can't he study at home?

401
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,379
Because he needs
special books, Ma.

What?

404
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,917
I bought two tomatoes yesterday

405
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,619
and I used one last night,

406
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,854
and I was saving
one for tonight.

407

Oh, I'm sorry, Gloria.

408
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,127
I must have put
it in Archie's stew.

409
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,629
Ma, how could you do that?

410
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,030
I was saving that tomato

411
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,466
special for Michael.

412
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,168
I said I was sorry, Gloria.

It looked like a regular tomato.

name on it or nothing.

to sop up the gravy?

that we're both in that kitchen

cooking two separate meals,

460

running into one another,
getting on each other's nerves.

That's your husband's
fault. You talk to him.

He come into $200, here.

463
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,952
He had the chance
to do the right thing

464
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,222
for this here family, but
what the hell does he care?

Well, what the hell do
you expect him to do?

curse in this house?

And don't you call
him "Meathead."

him, you help me.

ever make sacrifices for you?

No!

have liked him to?

Don't tell me what
a family's all about.

Look, Daddy, we made a deal.

480
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,385
You're giving us room and board

481
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,919
and we take care
of everything else.

482
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,355
We take care of
clothes and movies

and Michael's books, everything!

484
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,592
That was the deal!
What's my end of that deal?

We're gonna pay you back
every penny, with interest,

finishes school

00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,100
Wait a minute... Case closed!

489
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,402
All right.

490
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,570
Case closed!

491
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,739
Except for one more thing.

492
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,873
You've got the satisfaction

493
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,475
of knowing that you're
helping your child

494
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,776
be better off than you.

495
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,911
Every father wants his
kid to be better than him.

496
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,747
That don't always
work that way, little girl.

497
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,482
You look at the world
around you, there.

498
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,883
Take a look at your
animal kingdom,

499
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:28,917
for example, there.

500
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,319
I mean, take your gorilla.

501
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,821
Your gorilla wants his kid to
grow up better than him too,

502
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,022
but the kid grows up

503
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,624
and there he
is, still a gorilla.

504
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,648
What?

505
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,530
Hello.

506
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,953
Speaking of which.

507
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,234
Hi, Michael, honey. Hi.

508
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,836
Did you vote? Oh, yeah.

509
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,171
You should have seen the turnout

510
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,506
at the polls. It was great.

511
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,907
Yeah, it's the
first time in weeks

512
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,276
you're home at a decent
hour, there, Meathead.

513
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,378
Ain't you going to
the library tonight?

514
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,747
It's Election Day, Daddy.
The library's closed.

515
00:18:58,771 --> 00:18:59,915
Aw, gee,

516
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,383
that's too bad.

517
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,719
It's always more
pleasanter around here

518
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,253
when the library is open.

519
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,189
If you want to argue
tonight, Daddy,

520
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,590
you argue with yourself.

521
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,591
Come on, Michael.

522
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,592
EDITH: Dinner.

523
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,593
Gloria,

524
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,594
your dinner's ready too.

525
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,762
Hi, Mike. Hi, Ma.

526
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,597
Gee, that stew smells great.

527
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,533
Yeah, well, you just
smell it, Meathead,

528
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,867
and head for the kitchen.

529
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,035
Your grub's out there.

530
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,069
Come on, Michael. Dinner.

531
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,371
I'm coming.

532
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,672
Michael, how much longer

533
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,240
do I have to cover for you

534
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,475
with that library story?

535
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,210
Please, can't we tell
them you're working?

536
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,211
No, not yet, Gloria.

537
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,446
I don't want to tell him

538
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,448
until I make back the
$200 I gave to McGovern.

539
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,216
Well, how much
have you got so far?

540
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,317
150.

541
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,819
Oh, is that all?

542
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,754
Well, Gloria, it'll only
take another week.

543
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,622
What's for dinner?

544
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,659
Hamburgers.

545
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,661
Again?

546
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,696
I thought you like hamburgers.

547
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,865
I do, but not every day.

548
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:50,966
Every other day.

549
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,190
Last night, I made you meatloaf.

550
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,872
Gloria, hamburger is meatloaf.

551
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,174
It's the same thing
with a different name.

552
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,843
Can't you make something else?

553
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,711
Michael, I work hard all day

554
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,446
and then rush around
this kitchen like crazy

555
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,749
to make your dinner,
and all you do is complain.

556
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:09,351
You can thank your stupid,
pigheaded father for that.

557
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,387
Hold it. Don't you
call my father names

558
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,389
just because you
had a fight with him.

559
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,024
That's not being fair, and
maybe we're not being fair.

560
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,627
Maybe we should look at
things from his point of view.

561
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,129
That would be
impossible, Gloria.

562
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,965
We'd have to close
our minds first.

563
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,901
Michael, there are
two sides to everything.

564
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,002
Remember, it's not only

565
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,670
that you didn't give
Daddy the money,

566
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,873
but you gave it to
somebody he's dead against.

567
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,876
Gloria, whose side
are you on, anyway?

568
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,878
I'm on your side!

569
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,479
I'm always on your side!

570
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,915
It's just that I haven't been
home more than 10 minutes

571
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,418
and already I've had a fight
with my father and my mother

572
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,786
and now you!

573
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,987
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

574
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,957
Oh, shut up and
eat your meatloaf!

575
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,526
It's hamburgers.

576
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,249
It's the same thing!

577
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,098
Archie, do you hear them?

578
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,568
You'd better go in there.

579
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,236
Nah. As soon as she feeds him,

580
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,580
everything will quiet down.

581
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,509
Oh, no, you got to do something.

582
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,245
Things is going to
get worse and worse.

583
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,481
It's like that old saying,

584
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:17,040
"A house divided
by itself falls down."

585
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,098
I got another old
saying for you, Edith.

586
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,267
"A bird that
always flies in a fog

587
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,225
is called a dingbat."

588
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,941
Gloria,

589
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,742
these hamburgers are great.

590
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,944
See? What'd I tell you?

591
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,512
He's eating, all is happiness.

592
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,746
What channel should we watch?

593
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,114
Well...

594
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,483
Hold it, hold it!

595
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,284
Don't be talking about
watching no channels over there!

596
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,953
I'm going to watch
a movie, Channel 9.

597
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,153
Give me my remote control.

598
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,055
Arch, we want to watch
the election returns.

599
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,491
You care more
about a lousy movie

600
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:56,892
than you do a
presidential election?

601
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,560
Certainly! What do I
care about something

602
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,161
I know how it's
going to come out?

603
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,763
Everybody knows how
it's going to come out,

604
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,965
including them McGovern people.

605
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,199
See them on the newsreels

606
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,801
with all the worried
looks on their faces?

607
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,135
Not the Nixons.

608
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,104
See the picture of
Pat in the paper today?

609
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,472
She was all smiles.

610
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,640
Yeah, well,

611
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,074
maybe she won't
be smiling tomorrow.

612
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,476
Yes, she will, buddy boy,

613
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,845
because when she wakes
up tomorrow morning,

614
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,480
she knows she's been sleeping

615
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:22,417
with the president
of the U.S. of A.

616
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,185
Is she going to McGovern's place

617
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,289
or is he going to hers?

618
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh, I don't think
Mr. Nixon would like that

619
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,301
either way.

620
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,404
Come on, Daddy,

621
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,072
we want to watch
the election returns.

622
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,273
Turn it on. Yeah, come on!

623
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,575
You want to watch
the television,

624
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,443
then chip in a little
bit for the upkeep,

625
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,345
the wear and tear
and all that. All right.

626
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,313
Don't start with that
again. Forget it, all right?

627
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:53,715
We'll go watch from
McGovern headquarters.

628
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,618
Right, right, because you
got $200 worth of TV watching

629
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,820
coming to you down there.
You didn't pay for nothing here.

630
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,055
You ain't entitled to nothing.

631
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,156
All right! All right!

632
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,257
That's it! That's it!

633
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,324
I was gonna wait

634
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,226
until I had all the
money saved up,

635
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,895
but since you're so damn hungry

636
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,063
for your money, Arch,

637
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,698
here you are. $150. You happy?

638
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,300
Hey. Hey. Look at this.

639
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,369
Hey, Edith, there's
really 150 bucks

640
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,837
the guy has got here.

641
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,106
You mean you didn't give
this money to the McGoverns

642
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,207
after all?

643
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,142
I did give it to McGovern, Arch.

644
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,644
Well, where'd
you get this, then?

645
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:23,979
You play a number?

646
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,615
No, Daddy, he earned it.

647
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,816
He wasn't at the library

648
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,350
studying the last two weeks.

649
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,186
He was going to
school during the day

650
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,988
and then working
nights at the gas station

Oh, Archie!

Ain't you proud of him?

Gee whiz.

655
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,232
You mean the meathead
was actually working at a job?

656
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,333
That's right, Arch.

657
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,334
That's right,

and between school and that job,

659
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,671
I worked my butt off
to get you that money.

660
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:50,806
That's right,

got you that money,

662
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,610
I'm going to get you
every nickel I owe you!

Are you satisfied, Daddy?

664
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:59,314
Oh, well, I hear him
talking over there,

out of the voting booth.

673
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:25,763
I wonder who he voted for.

674
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,853
Who do you think he voted for?

675
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,387
He voted for himself.

676

Just like I told you, Arch.
