00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,839
Tackle him, Chai.

3
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:30,924
You can do it, Chai.

4
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,276
Come on, Chai. Let's go eat.

5
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,797
Hey Prem.

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,508
Your mother bought a Sponge Bob cake
for your birthday party.

7
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,471
Sponge Bob cake
for a little boy!

8
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,850
Stop giving me a hard time.

9
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,937
Guess where we're going?

10
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,818
Before your party,
let's go to the cave.

11
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,072
Yeah, the cave
for the birthday boy!

12
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,785
I'll race you to the park.

13
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,413
Then I better go with you.

14
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,290
We have to go quickly,
it'll be dark soon.

15
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,129
Coach, my dad's
cooking for the party.

16
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,047
I promised to help.

17
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,674
You're a good son.

18
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,758
See you at the party.

19
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,429
Okay, bye. See you at 7pm.

20
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,626
Go! Go!

21
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,086
Hey, Arm!

22
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,508
Go!

23
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,262
Ahh!

24
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,723
Go, walk slowly.

25
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,436
This is always the best part.

26
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,467
Keep going!

27
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,410
I told Prem to come straight home
after practice.

28
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,294
Well, if they stop over tell them
we're waiting to start the party.

29
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,762
Sorry I'm late.

30
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,973
The shop got really busy.

31
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,058
You're Chai's mom, right?

32
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,521
That's right.

33
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:21,358
I want to watch the games
but I'm always working.

34
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:24,861
Bye.

35
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,264
Looks like
they did go to the cave.

36
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,282
All of them?

37
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,910
In this rain?

38
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,662
It wasn't raining earlier.

39
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,417
Excuse me.

40
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,003
Shouldn't we drive to the cave
and get them?

41
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,338
They'll get soaked riding back.

42
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:47,217
What are they thinking
staying in the cave this late.

43
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,347
Heavy rain is forecast
in Northern Thailand

44
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,642
as the monsoon season
starts early.

45
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,103
Monsoon?

46
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,813
That usually starts in July.

47
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,482
It can't be the monsoon.

48
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,652
{\an8}That cave floods every year.

49
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,645
That's Chai's bike!

50
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,191
We're the parents
who called ahead.

51
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,275
Have you seen the boys?

52
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,819
We've looked
and can't go any further.

53
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,613
The cave's flooding.

54
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,822
We called the authorities.

55
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,284
It's flooding.
How can the boys get out?

56
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,662
I've already asked for help.

57
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,829
Please wait.

58
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,957
Let's go in and get them.

59
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,709
Calm down and wait for help.

60
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,633
Chai!

61
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,261
Chai!

62
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,304
Chai! Can you hear me?

63
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,889
Chai!

64
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,100
Chai!

65
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,312
I just started my dinner.

66
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,981
Sorry, Governor.

67
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,110
Have the SEALs been deployed?

68
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,196
They're already
on the ground, sir.

69
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,104
- Is that them there?
- Yes.

70
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,220
This is Vern Unsworth.

71
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,559
I'm the Governor
of the province. You are?

72
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,478
Captain Arnont Sureewong.

73
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,190
Navy SEALs, sir.

74
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,942
Move everything to the tent.

75
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,028
I need an update.

76
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,575
My men will enter
with scuba gear.

77
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,098
This way, please.

78
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,998
This man lives nearby, sir.
He knows the cave.

79
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,709
Hello.

80
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,086
I've mapped it. All of it.

81
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,422
Now, I haven't been in
when it's flooded.

82
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,759
It's a whole 'nother game.
You have to be a bit nuts.

83
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,971
But, look, there's some
pretty tight corners in there.

84
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,973
A real squeeze.

85
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,767
But there are some
big chambers too.

86
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,210
Let me show this
to my men. Please.

87
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,144
Let's go.

88
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,984
Maybe I could find you
something to eat, sir?

89
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,195
That would be kind.

90
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,405
This could be a long night.

91
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,652
Start laying guideline
from here.

92
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,549
It's a deep cave,

93
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,300
several kilometers long,

94
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,636
with some narrow passages.

95
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,431
If the boys have gone
a long way in,

96
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,683
it could take
several more hours.

97
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,852
But I have every confidence
in the Navy SEALs.

98
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,041
Hello, Governor.

99
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,838
The SEALs are coming.

100
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,140
We couldn't find the boys.

101
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,519
We hit a flash flood.

102
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,740
There's no visibility
or space to maneuver.

103
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,430
The currents are too strong
and shifting.

104
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,384
It's been two days since the Wild Boars
football team got trapped in the cave.

105
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,871
Thai authorities have activated
over one hundred government agencies.

106
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,708
In an astonishing nationwide
effort to rescue the boys,

107
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,962
volunteers have also joined the effort,
pumping water out of the cave.

108
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,215
There is mounting
pressure on officials

109
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,967
to help these boys
by any means necessary.

110
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,686
Minister.

111
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,814
Governor.

112
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,941
Bring me up to speed.

113
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,276
Pumping has begun, Minister.

114
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,695
I know that.

115
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,488
With the largest pumps
in the region.

116
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,950
I ordered them myself.

117
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,745
So far the divers have been unable
to get through as the water is so high.

118
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,623
The flooded sections are very narrow
and difficult to navigate.

119
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,958
The current is very strong.

120
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,335
You haven't found the boys?

121
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,421
And you don't know
where they are?

122
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,631
Or even if they're alive?

123
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,342
I know you were to be
transferred out next week

124
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,178
but you'll remain here
as Governor until this is done.

125
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,091
They tell me you're the guy
who knows this mountain best.

126
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,509
Sure.

127
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:31,139
You know the cave is flooded.
There are boys trapped in there.

128
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,308
Who are you?

129
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,686
Thanet Natisri,
I'm a water engineer from Bangkok.

130
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,272
The government sent for you?

131
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,318
No I just came,
like everyone else.

132
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,404
There's no time to wait
for help from the officials.

133
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,699
The rain water
is flooding into the cave.

134
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,118
It's coming from above,
not below.

135
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,870
We have to stop it getting in.

136
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,873
I need to find all the sinkholes
and divert them.

137
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,859
I know many like this.

138
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,171
Yeah, John?

139
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,191
<i>Uh, hey, Rick, you following
what's happening in Thailand?</i>

140
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,134
Some kids stuck in a cave.

141
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,971
<i>Yeah, no,
not really. Why?</i>

142
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,556
<i>How did they get themselves
in there?</i>

143
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,558
Uh, I don't know. Doesn't say.

144
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,185
Well, if they walked in,
they can walk out.

145
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,646
<i>The Thai government's been
given a list of rescue divers.</i>

146
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,981
We're on the list.

147
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,401
What cave is this?

148
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,610
<i>Uh, Tham Luang.</i>

149
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,755
Hey, Matthew, that'll be your mum.

150
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,322
Matthew.

151
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,158
Okay, okay.

152
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,701
Vern mapped it
a couple of years ago.

153
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,869
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,121
Got it. Up north.

155
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,581
<i>That's the one. Yeah.</i>

156
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,332
It's just a tourist cave.

157
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,835
It looks easy, but Vern said
when it's flooded,

158
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,128
<i>it's impossible.</i>

159
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,755
- Impossible for Vern.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

160
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,023
Get your stuff

161
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,150
- together, all right?
- Okay.

162
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,592
Well, they've got teams

163
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,926
climbing all over the mountain.

164
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,362
They're drilling holes
and searching...

165
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,429
Holes?

166
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,639
- Rick, one second.
<i>- Drilling holes?</i>

167
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,932
<i>They don't need us, John.</i>

168
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,518
- Where's it this time, Dad?
- Thailand.

169
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,603
You got everything?

170
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,147
- Yep.
- Yeah? Give us a hug.

171
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,833
- All right. See you later.
- Come along, Matthew.

172
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,525
See ya.

173
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,503
Thanks, Annabel. I'll let you
know if I have to go.

174
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,653
- Okay.
- Sorry.

175
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,989
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, son.

176
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,456
Rick, look, if you don't wanna
do it, I'll just call Jason.

177
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,000
Just call Jason
if you'd rather go with Jason.

178
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,686
I didn't say
I'd rather go with Jason.

179
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,170
I would rather go with you.

180
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,254
<i>Just to confirm,</i>

181
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,923
no one's actually asked
for us yet?

182
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,424
<i>No, Vern just gave them
our names</i>

183
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,651
<i>and, you know,
we should be ready</i>

184
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,136
<i>in case they do ask for us.
Maybe start packing</i>

185
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,387
if you think you're coming.

186
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,889
<i>Hmm.</i>

187
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,309
I don't even like kids.

188
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,685
Okay, Rick.

189
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,680
This is a massive
rescue operation

190
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,198
with over a thousand volunteers
from all over the world.

191
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,828
Thai volunteers are joined
by volunteers from China,

192
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:44,207
Japan, America,
Britain and Australia.

193
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,682
In order to reduce
the water levels,

194
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,267
Thai military and volunteers

195
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,603
are working around the clock
to pump water from the cave.

196
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,106
Due to worsening conditions
inside the cave,

197
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,567
all rescue dive efforts
have been put on hold.

198
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,281
Hey, guys, I'm sorry,

199
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,949
but we will have to walk
from here.

200
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:21,953
Got any custard creams left?

201
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,205
Just one, okay?

202
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,289
Yeah.

203
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,760
Thanks.

204
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,904
Did you take two custard creams?

205
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,221
No.

206
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,764
Yes, you did.

207
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,766
You took two at once.
You're like a child.

208
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,894
- I'm like a child?
- Okay, guys.

209
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,354
It's the building on the left,
next to the laundry.

210
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,915
I will get the tanks
and meet you there.

211
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:50,982
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay?

212
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:59,949
In World Cup Group H,
Poland beat Japan by one goal to nil.

213
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,505
So, what do we do now?

214
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,009
We do what we came to do.

215
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,554
Go in that cave.

216
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,932
Seriously, I mean,

217
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,767
I don't care
about the custard creams,

218
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,353
but it's like I tell my son,
I care about trust.

219
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,896
And I'm disappointed, Rick.

220
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,357
But that's okay, that's okay.

221
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,572
The cave is closed.

222
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,366
No, we're meant to go in.

223
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,201
The cave is closed.

224
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,764
We just flew
all the way from England.

225
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,072
Can I help?

226
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,747
Hello.

227
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,293
I'm Rick Stanton,
this is John Volanthen.

228
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,754
We've been flown in by
the Thai government to help.

229
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,297
You are British army?

230
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,675
No. British Cave
Rescue Council.

231
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,009
We're volunteers.

232
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,010
The cave is flooded.

233
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,929
- Yeah, we...
- John.

234
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,640
Hey, Vern, there seems
to be a problem here.

235
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,642
They're telling us
the cave's closed.

236
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,953
Yeah, well,
it's getting bad in there.

237
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,311
They're pulling everyone out.

238
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,063
These are the men you want.

239
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,439
I gave the governor their names.

240
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:14,607
The governor sent for them?

241
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,985
Sir, look at them.

242
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,736
They're amateurs.

243
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,297
They'll never survive
the currents in the cave.

244
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,239
No, no, no.

245
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,008
They've done cave rescues
all over the world.

246
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,951
Our names must be
on some list somewhere.

247
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,327
I told the governor,

248
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,013
- "These are the men you need."
- Look, guys,

249
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,181
the children
are still in the cave, yeah?

250
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,265
- Look, John...
- Yeah, but...

251
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,392
- Just a sec.
- The clock is ticking.

252
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,810
Look, lads,
it's just that they don't want

253
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,168
foreigners dying in the cave.

254
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,253
It's not a good look.

255
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,879
We won't die.

256
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,840
I have zero interest in dying.

257
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,008
How about you, John?

258
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:40,967
Yeah, same.

259
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,650
If the governor sent for them...

260
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:44,929
You can dive.

261
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,431
Thank you.

262
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,743
Lads, first
it's gonna be a series

263
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,271
of small cascades,

264
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,856
followed by
a deeper wading section

265
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,065
before your first dive.

266
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,650
Your best chance is a large cave

267
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,068
about two kilometers in.

268
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:36,873
You're all right.

269
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,645
I'll follow. I need a few
more minutes to fix this pump.

270
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,462
The water level is getting high.

271
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:42,797
It's almost running.

272
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,817
Let's have a look.

273
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,728
Shit!

274
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,292
That's it.
We better head back.

275
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,260
Wait, wait. You speak English?

276
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,846
I fix pump, but water come fast.

277
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:37,930
Bloody hell.

278
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,683
We'll have to dive him out.

279
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,101
- Can you swim?
- Yes.

280
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,311
Give me your mask.

281
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,812
I'll take him out and come back.

282
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:45,895
Okay.

283
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,148
Right.

284
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,233
You breathe through this.

285
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,445
Breathe. Okay?

286
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,528
Mask.

287
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,534
Face in the water.
Just try it.

288
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,620
We swim together. All right?

289
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:03,956
Here we go.

290
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,428
Stop it!

291
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,513
Help!

292
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,099
Over here!

293
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,091
That was exciting.

294
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,552
Not in a good way.

295
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,803
Did he make it out okay?

296
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,054
Yeah.

297
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,906
Hello.

298
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,992
I'm the governor
of this province.

299
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,618
Grateful for your help.

300
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,456
We went as far as we could.

301
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,124
Didn't find the boys.

302
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,459
How far did you get?

303
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,710
T-junction.

304
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,881
The T-junction is the same
location my team got to.

305
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,383
That's as far
as they laid their line.

306
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,386
I sent for them on good advice.

307
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,681
I'm pursuing every avenue
open to me.

308
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,434
Yes, Governor.

309
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,729
I'll let you know when
the rescue operation can be resumed.

310
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,874
I must ask, please,

311
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,697
do not go in the cave again
without my permission.

312
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,662
Just a sec, boys.
Sir?

313
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,547
What was all that about?

314
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,841
Well, in theory,
the governor's in charge,

315
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,177
but Captain Arnont's
the Navy chief on the ground

316
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,262
and he doesn't take orders
from civilians.

317
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,681
Plus, the rumor is,
the governor's been sacked.

318
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,326
This was supposed to have been
his last week here,

319
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,060
and now he's been ordered
to stay on.

320
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,479
Just in case
they need a fall guy.

321
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,690
Hmm. Hey, Vern.
What's all that?

322
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,193
That's a shrine
to Princess Nang Non,

323
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,278
the Sleeping Princess.

324
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:23,155
This is her mountain.

325
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,949
Nang Non mountain.

326
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,760
They say when you
see it from a distance,

327
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:29,912
it looks like
a sleeping princess.

328
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,498
They say that her tears
trapped the boys.

329
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,959
The Sleeping Princess is angry.

330
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,126
Angry?

331
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,546
What's she angry about?

332
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,130
I don't know.

333
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,007
It's just what
the local people say.

334
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,773
Life threatening infections
are a concern.

335
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,735
We need to remember that
every breath they take

336
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:05,030
increases carbon dioxide levels.

337
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:08,617
As oxygen decreases,
physical exertion becomes more taxing.

338
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,792
Right here, that's their tent.

339
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,299
Sam!

340
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,633
Hi, Captain.

341
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,385
Hey.

342
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,846
You're not at work?

343
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,265
I took a vacation.

344
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,392
So you broke free?

345
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,062
I got bored of watching you
on the news.

346
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,607
Hey team, this is Sam an.

347
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,484
Saman's one of us.
He served under me for ten years.

348
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,320
We chased pirates together.

349
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,239
I brought my old scuba gear.

350
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,157
I want to help.

351
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,617
Welcome.

352
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,868
Excuse me!

353
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,953
Excuse me!

354
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,749
Can I talk with you please?

355
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,043
Sir,

356
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,463
my boy is in the cave

357
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,633
and now it's flooding.

358
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,676
I don't know if my son
is alive or dead.

359
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,679
All I ask from you, sir,

360
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,517
is to bring me his body.

361
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:31,617
Excuse me, governor?

362
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,577
Major Charlie Hodges.
US Air Force, Okinawa.

363
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:34,828
This is Captain Olivia Taft.

364
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,080
Governor.

365
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,243
We're the nearest
Special Operations Squad.

366
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,459
But we have medics,
comms, logistics experts.

367
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,835
We'll do whatever we can
to help.

368
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,504
Thank you.

369
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,464
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

370
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,549
Thank you.
Everyone!

371
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:48,926
We're going to get started now.

372
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,680
So, we think that the boys
were heading for here.

373
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,889
They call it Pattaya Beach.

374
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,143
With the high water level
and the low visibility,

375
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,188
and the difficulty
of the cave itself,

376
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:06,193
our divers were not able
to reach them.

377
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:08,904
So, now, the question is,

378
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,740
when do we go back in?

379
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,451
And who is going in?

380
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,124
We need the rain to stop,
and let the pumps do the work.

381
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,834
And then, we go in.

382
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,044
We can go in now.

383
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,129
Yeah. No offense,

384
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,256
but you're trained
to dive in open water,

385
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,841
not confined spaces.

386
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,468
Rick and I
have been diving in caves

387
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,178
just like this for 30 years now.

388
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,582
It takes
a certain kind of mindset

389
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,890
for the deep cave diving.

390
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,976
Breathing techniques,
special ways of moving.

391
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,310
It's just different.

392
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:44,648
I'm responsible for my men.

393
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,526
As for anyone else,

394
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,111
that's for the governor
to decide.

395
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,335
No one will go in for now.

396
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,688
We'll wait for the rain to stop.

397
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,255
Thank you.

398
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,618
We need to build dams
for every sinkhole.

399
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:33,030
Seems like he just showed up
on his own, sir.

400
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,407
The men working with him
are local villagers.

401
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,702
I don't believe we've met.

402
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,112
I'm the water guy.

403
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,332
You are American?

404
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,877
I live in Illinois
but I'm from Bangkok.

405
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,004
I was in Bangkok
when I heard the news.

406
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,048
I rounded up some volunteers
and here we are.

407
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,110
I am the governor.

408
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,012
Tell me how you can help.

409
00:34:58,514 --> 00:34:59,890
Of course.

410
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,060
There's a network
of mountain streams

411
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:07,105
carrying water through all the fissures
and cracks into the cave.

412
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,316
That's what's creating
the strong currents.

413
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:13,821
If we find a way to divert these streams,
the water level will drop.

414
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,740
I thought that's why we're pumping water
out of the cave below.

415
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,992
No, sir.
Those pumps are useless.

416
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,954
The cave is at the bottom,
water will keep running in from above.

417
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,705
Can you stop that?

418
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:25,958
We are trying.

419
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,336
But there's a price to pay.

420
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,224
You've all been in the cave.

421
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,852
You know how the water comes
in from the mountain above.

422
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,604
Now we want to divert the water

423
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:48,981
down the side of the mountain,

424
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,358
away from the cave,

425
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,236
onto your fields.

426
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,912
We will lose our crop?

427
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,582
Yes.

428
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:09,001
This will save the boys?

429
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,297
Honestly,
I can't promise anything.

430
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,841
Um...

431
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,552
But it will give the boys
a chance.

432
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,823
Agreed.

433
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,575
For the boys.

434
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,786
<i>With this much-needed break</i>

435
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,686
<i>in the monsoon rains,</i>

436
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,897
<i>consensus among
the many volunteers here</i>

437
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,357
<i>is that the search for the boys</i>

438
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,109
<i>and their coach may soon resume.</i>

439
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,462
<i>The frustration
for the families, though,</i>

440
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,947
<i>is that nobody seems to know
when that might be,</i>

441
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,449
<i>or indeed,
how it will take place.</i>

442
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,785
<i>Nine days after they entered
this huge cave system,</i>

443
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,161
<i>the questions remains</i>

444
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,964
<i>as to whether the boys
can still be rescued.</i>

445
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,414
Suppose they're alive in there.

446
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,668
What's it like for them?

447
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,004
Why say that?

448
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,216
I was just wondering.

449
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,765
Huh.

450
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,976
I can just about see her.

451
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,896
Princess Nang Non.

452
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,296
We've just received word

453
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,991
that a water diversion
operation is underway.

454
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,201
Volunteers are building dams
and positioning pipes

455
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,036
in order to redirect the water

456
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,372
from the mountain
into the surrounding fields.

457
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,374
Rescue teams
hope that this will limit

458
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,459
the flow of water into the cave

459
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,663
and allow the pumps to reduce
the water levels inside.

460
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,590
I asked if Kruba could come
and he's here already.

461
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,730
Lek, Lek.

462
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,768
Can you take these to Kruba?

463
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,281
Excuse me.

464
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,450
Kruba, please could you
bless these for me?

465
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,007
Thank you.

466
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:54,351
I'm told the pumps are working
and the rain has stopped.

467
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,061
When can the SEALs go in again?

468
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,939
For the waters to recede,

469
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,899
at least twenty-four hours.

470
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,654
The British divers
are ready to go in.

471
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,241
Our team is preparing.

472
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,576
I think it's too risky
to let them in now.

473
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,807
They're amongst the best in the world
at diving in these conditions.

474
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,958
Let's use them as scouts

475
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,085
and see what happens?

476
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,546
Sir,

477
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,506
the Minister requests an update.

478
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:43,608
Video.

479
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,318
If you get past T-junction.

480
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,867
Please, take care.

481
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:02,437
Pattaya Beach.

482
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:04,939
Hello!

483
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Hello!

484
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,913
All right.

485
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:20,996
I'll keep left.

486
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:22,958
Feel out for bodies.

487
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,285
You smell that?

488
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,123
Yeah.

489
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:49,877
Okay.

490
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:56,801
Nearly out of line.

491
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:07,562
Hey.

492
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,026
They're here.

493
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,112
How many?

494
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,246
Hello?

495
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,351
- Hello.
- Hello!

496
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,751
- Hello.
- Hello.

497
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,211
How have they done that?

498
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,339
Thank you.

499
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,174
English. English.

500
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,384
English?

501
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,596
Thank you.

502
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,264
How many of you?

503
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,308
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?

504
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:46,559
They're all alive.

505
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:47,727
- Thirteen?
- Yes.

506
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:48,811
Brilliant!

507
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:50,522
Brilliant.

508
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,822
Uh, can we go out now?

509
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,408
Uh, no, not today.

510
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,034
No, there are just two of us.

511
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,285
We must dive.

512
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,621
But many people are coming.
It's okay.

513
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,581
We are the first,
but... But...

514
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,417
But many will come. Many more.

515
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:13,270
You've been here ten days.

516
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,296
Ten days!
You are very strong.

517
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,132
Very strong.

518
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,554
We are hungry.

519
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,013
I know, I know. I know.

520
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,474
I understand.

521
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,643
Okay, go back. We will come.

522
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,354
Go on back.

523
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,943
Uh, what day
you come and help us?

524
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,026
Uh...

525
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,240
- We help tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

526
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,384
There are more divers.

527
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,909
- Thai divers.
- Thai?

528
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:48,830
We'll come tomorrow with food
and doctors, and everything.

529
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,290
Don't, John.
You don't know that.

530
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,340
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

531
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,343
You are very brave.

532
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:04,971
How have you stayed so strong?

533
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,515
We are team

534
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,434
and we help each other.

535
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,478
And our coach help us.

536
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:12,561
Coach.

537
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,829
I offer my most sincere apologies
for leading the boys into danger.

538
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,570
It's not true! Coach helped us!
We love our coach! He's the best!

539
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:25,241
It is because
of our coach we stay strong.

540
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:27,911
He teach us to, uh, meditate.

541
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,541
- And, uh, we pray.
- You pray?

542
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:36,169
- Yes, yes.
- I bet you do. All right.

543
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,589
How...
How did you find us?

544
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:47,722
We dig.

545
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:52,392
We dig.

546
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,400
This is to get out?

547
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:05,864
Good work.

548
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,328
Uh...

549
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,248
We hear a sound in the cave.

550
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,542
We are very scared.

551
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,501
No need to be scared now.

552
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,087
It's just water.
It's just the cave.

553
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,089
I hear it too, it's just...

554
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,173
John...

555
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,343
We should get back.

556
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,470
All right.

557
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,139
Right.

558
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,236
Here.

559
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:47,114
The batteries are fresh.

560
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,076
Thank you.

561
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,536
You stay strong.

562
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:00,294
Good luck.

563
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,402
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

564
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,779
Hello!

565
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:09,906
- Hello!
- Hey!

566
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,452
We found the boys.

567
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:15,662
They're alive.

568
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,039
Careful who sees that.

569
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,250
The old men found the boys!

570
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,152
Do we know how many?

571
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,052
<i>How many of you?</i>

572
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,595
They found the boys!

573
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:33,596
<i>Thirteen?</i>

574
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,597
<i>They're all alive.</i>

575
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:35,681
I can't believe it.

576
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:37,392
They're alive!

577
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,494
<i>- Thirteen?
- Yes.</i>

578
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:39,518
<i>Brilliant!</i>

579
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:51,781
They found the boys.

580
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:53,616
Everyone's alive.

581
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,701
They're safe.

582
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,035
Everyone's alive?

583
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,045
They found the boys!

584
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:07,964
They found the boys!

585
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:38,327
Oh, shit.

586
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,746
Everybody knows.

587
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:40,955
That didn't take long.

588
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,920
Rick, John,
how are the boys doing?

589
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:49,505
Where did you find the boys?

590
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,437
Are there any injuries?

591
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,297
<i>We're going to bring you</i>

592
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,363
<i>some breaking news now.</i>

593
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:17,575
<i>Reports coming in
from Chiang Rai, Thailand.</i>

594
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,243
<i>Specialist cave rescue divers</i>

595
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:22,038
<i>Rick Stanton,
a retired firefighter,</i>

596
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:25,082
<i>and John Volanthen,
an IT consultant,</i>

597
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:28,544
<i>have found the missing boys
and their football coach.</i>

598
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,129
<i>Last seen nine days ago</i>

599
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:32,840
<i>and presumed trapped
in the flooded caves,</i>

600
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,134
<i>all twelve boys and their coach</i>

601
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:37,595
<i>are now confirmed to be alive.</i>

602
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,239
Christ, there's more of 'em now.

603
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:58,199
Come on, we should just go.

604
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,700
Let's go. Straight to the van.

605
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,423
Let's move you back inside.

606
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,300
Back inside. Back inside.

607
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,635
Just head back in.

608
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,887
Come on, guys, let's just give
'em some space, okay?

609
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:20,989
Thank you. Been a long day.

610
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,366
Can you please comment
on US involvement?

611
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,641
Thank you very much.

612
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,397
- Thank you.
- Okay.

613
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,274
Thank you so much.
You found them.

614
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,111
The news guys
can be a pain in the butt.

615
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,446
You just gotta
handle them right.

616
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,323
What do you want me
to tell them?

617
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,701
"We found the boys.
Now let's all watch 'em die."

618
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,911
Okay, Rick, take it easy.

619
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:45,663
I'm just telling it like it is.

620
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,999
All this water pumping,

621
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,668
flooding fields,
praying to shrines,

622
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,253
it's bullshit!

623
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,336
I'm not having it.

624
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:56,674
The Thai SEALs
are going in tomorrow.

625
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,676
Those boys are never coming out.

626
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,096
Never.

627
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,646
Our most experienced divers
are going to...

628
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:14,692
No, sir.
It's not about your divers.

629
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,361
We brought a man out
on our first dive,

630
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:18,525
and he completely panicked.

631
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:19,571
Almost drowned.

632
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:24,660
And that was a very short swim.

633
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:27,580
You try and dive those kids
the whole way,

634
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,916
all you'll be bringing out
is dead bodies!

635
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,009
Governor! Governor! Governor!

636
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,677
Okay, let's get you guys
out of here.

637
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,970
Okay. Come on.

638
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,364
This is exactly
what I didn't want.

639
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,159
Well, you knew we'd find them.

640
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,602
I didn't expect
to find them alive.

641
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,286
Well, it's done now.

642
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,389
Okay, can we go, Bas, please?

643
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,340
Sorry.

644
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:04,510
It's okay.

645
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:11,350
When will they come back?

646
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:14,020
Maybe they won't come.

647
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:20,401
They'll come when they're ready.
We must be ready.

648
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:23,654
Fear is created in our minds.

649
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,700
Close your eyes.

650
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:38,586
Let your mind be at peace.

651
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,424
Feel the air
you breathe in and out.

652
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,932
Breathe in.

653
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,518
Breathe out.

654
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,103
Slowly.

655
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:04,487
We are standing by at the base camp
of the rescue mission.

656
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,323
Rescuers are attempting to find
alternative ways to reach the cave.

657
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,742
Experts believe the boys
will never survive

658
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,328
three months of monsoon rains
and flooding.

659
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:19,126
Still using the same Scubapro regulator
from my time.

660
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,260
On your first dive,

661
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:30,262
you made it to the T-junction?

662
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:31,514
I did, yeah.

663
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,268
Do you want a briefing
on the rest of the way?

664
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,730
Yeah, please. Come in.

665
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:46,362
You made it here.

666
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,741
You have a 250-meter dive here,

667
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,243
with a narrow rift,

668
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,371
barely shoulder-wide,
to Chamber 7.

669
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,081
Then you have to de-kit

670
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,584
and carry your gear
over a long rock shelf

671
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,128
to get to Pattaya Beach.

672
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:03,337
Then comes a tough dive.

673
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,675
It's a long, shallow tunnel,

674
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:11,971
bit more twisty than this,
350 meters.

675
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,099
No visibility. Pulling against
very strong currents.

676
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,892
No headroom at all.

677
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,687
And there's undercuts
on all the bends.

678
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,147
They're very, very dangerous.

679
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,483
So, you must always keep
to the wider side of the line,

680
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,694
or you'll get trapped.

681
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:29,238
At the end of that,
you'll reach the boys.

682
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:33,284
And it's a very physical dive.

683
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,202
So, try and save
two-thirds of your air

684
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:36,429
going in,
so you can make it back.

685
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,955
We will get there.

686
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:38,873
We'll reach the boys today.

687
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:39,874
Yeah.

688
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,292
Let's pack up.

689
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,751
Best of luck, Kiet.

690
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:43,835
Thank you.

691
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,006
Thank you.

692
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,383
Good luck.

693
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,428
They'll do a good job.

694
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,638
Those are our boys in there.

695
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,348
Hmm.

696
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:58,017
Look, I know your men are tough,

697
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,270
but it's not gonna be easy
for them.

698
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:42,538
Navy SEALs.

699
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,879
Not bad for eleven days
without food.

700
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:53,257
The boys in the north,
they're tough.

701
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:57,594
We have a little food and batteries.

702
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:04,935
Two bites each.

703
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,979
We must save them for later.

704
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,112
Coach.

705
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,157
I'm a doctor.

706
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,908
I'm going to check the boys.

707
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:25,789
What's your name?

708
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:26,707
Arm.

709
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,790
Arm.

710
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,045
You're very strong.

711
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:46,935
Kiet.

712
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,398
{\an8}The oxygen in the cave
is below twenty.

713
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,819
Jay.

714
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:57,988
We only have enough air
for one of us to get back.

715
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:00,491
We used more tanks
than we planned on.

716
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,869
Take it and return to base.

717
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,749
Report the oxygen meter
is close to the red zone.

718
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,247
You understand the situation?

719
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,720
We're staying here with you.

720
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,441
Bring Jay some water.

721
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:36,944
He's cramping!

722
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:57,673
Now you see why the Minister
left me in charge.

723
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:08,267
Now the Navy SEALs
have reached the boys.

724
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,770
They will support the boys,

725
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:15,065
as we prepare for next stage
of the rescue.

726
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:19,194
I give my word to everyone,

727
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:22,573
the boys will come out safely.

728
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,507
Governor, sir.

729
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:43,469
Excuse me, Governor.

730
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:45,888
How can I help?

731
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:47,848
Can I speak
with the Governor please?

732
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:51,143
The Governor is busy.
I can help you.

733
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:56,607
Our families are Shan.
We don't have ID cards.

734
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,275
Will they still help our boys?

735
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,943
Will they rescue them too?

736
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,379
Is everything okay?

737
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,089
Well, she's afraid
her boy won't be rescued.

738
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,240
They are Shan from Myanmar,
just over the border.

739
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:06,324
Stateless.

740
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:12,456
Don't worry, your son will be rescued
from the cave with all the others.

741
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,501
You should be proud of your son.
He's been very patient.

742
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:18,003
Governor!

743
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,381
It's been twelve days already.

744
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,842
Inside it's dark and cold
with no food.

745
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:25,928
How long can the boys
be patient?

746
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,429
When are you getting them out?

747
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:30,366
There are three SEALs
staying with the boys.

748
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,643
We're planning to send food in.

749
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:34,884
I understand how you must feel.

750
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,523
How can you understand?

751
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:40,817
Is your son going to die?

752
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:01,630
Somebody's gonna have to
come up with something.

753
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:07,511
Rick.

754
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,012
Whoa. What are you thinking?

755
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,601
Just a crazy idea.

756
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:16,687
So tell me.

757
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:20,274
Rick, crazy is better
than nothing.

758
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,358
We've got nothing.

759
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,192
We call Harry.

760
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:25,695
- Harry?
- Mmm.

761
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,073
Doctor Harris.

762
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,628
- That's brilliant.
- Mmm.

763
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,797
Or insane.

764
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,090
Or both.

765
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:52,806
Don't know if he'd do it.

766
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,474
I... I don't know the man,

767
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:56,685
but, I mean...

768
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,856
I bet he'd come if he thought
it was just to lend a hand.

769
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:06,277
Hmm.

770
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:09,197
He might buy that.

771
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:10,282
He's a good diver.

772
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:11,824
Yeah.

773
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,621
We could use
a couple more divers

774
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:17,497
who can handle
rescue work anyway.

775
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,833
I was thinking Jason.
You know?

776
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,084
If he's not too pissed off

777
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:22,488
that he hasn't
been asked already.

778
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:25,672
Maybe Chris Jewell.

779
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,801
You think
Chris will be up to it?

780
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:31,887
- Everyone says he's excellent.
- Mmm-hmm.

781
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,640
Jason says he's strong.

782
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:36,767
Of course, he's never done
a rescue like this.

783
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:38,935
I'll call him.

784
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:41,271
- Yeah?
- Okay.

785
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:56,870
Chris, let me show you.

786
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,623
So, you are carrying
one meal a day

787
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,208
for one week
for everyone in the cave.

788
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,626
- All right. Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

789
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:15,013
Jason, keep an eye
on Chris, yeah?

790
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:16,282
Yeah.
He'll be all right.

791
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,308
He's young.
Remember young, Rick?

792
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:20,352
I'm not that far behind.

793
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:54,344
We have food.

794
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,820
Thought the kids might like to
write back to their parents.

795
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,211
Yeah.

796
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:30,547
Good. Thank you.

797
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:36,803
Paper to write letters.

798
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:42,809
It's strange.

799
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:45,395
The parents thanking me
for taking care of their children.

800
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,815
I thought they would blame me.

801
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:52,486
No one blames you, Coach.

802
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:02,305
Somebody
get these to their parents.

803
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,205
Notes from the boys.

804
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:04,288
Okay.

805
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,460
So, did I pass?

806
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,420
- What?
- Did I pass?

807
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:12,464
No, you were terrible.

808
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,067
- You did great. You did great.
- Good.

809
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,302
Well, that's quite a dive.

810
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,625
How the hell do you think
we're gonna get those kids out?

811
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:22,057
We're working on it.

812
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:26,913
<i>Just seconds left on the clock.</i>

813
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:28,289
<i>Neymar couldn't do it
with that last check.</i>

814
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,665
<i>And that's it,
the whistle's blown.</i>

815
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,399
<i>Belgium beat Brazil.</i>

816
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:33,652
<i>The favorites have been
knocked out of the World Cup.</i>

817
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,055
<i>Belgium are through
to the semi...</i>

818
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,572
I'll get the bags.

819
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:38,907
Thanks, Bas.

820
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,284
Hey, Harry.

821
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:44,120
Glad you made it.

822
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:46,748
Mate, thanks for bringing me in.

823
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,083
Oh, sure.

824
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,210
- Good to meet you, Harry.
- Well, what a pleasure.

825
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,729
- How was the flight?
- Oh, that was pretty good.

826
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,631
It's just, gettin' the permits
is a bloody hassle.

827
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:55,900
You wanna see the cave?

828
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:57,300
Yeah.
That's what I'm here for.

829
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:59,104
- Come on, then.
- All right.

830
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:00,971
The families,

831
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,431
they've been here since day one.

832
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,183
Oh, imagine what they're
going through.

833
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:07,602
We managed to bring some
letters to them from the kids.

834
01:09:07,686 --> 01:09:08,687
Oh, yeah?

835
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:16,361
And in about 2.5k,
there they are.

836
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:18,947
That's it.

837
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:22,868
So, who else answered the call?

838
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,244
Who else you got here?

839
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,180
Oh, there's divers coming in
from all over the place.

840
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,498
We've got Jason Mallinson
with us and Chris Jewell.

841
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:30,125
Wow.

842
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,376
The Awesome Foursome.

843
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,220
I'm not in the same league
as you guys, but...

844
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,969
But you've got a skill

845
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,512
none of the rest
of us have, Harry.

846
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:45,891
What's that?

847
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:47,854
Well, he's talkin' about
your area of expertise.

848
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,229
I'm an anesthetist.

849
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:52,397
Right.

850
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:55,609
No.

851
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,402
No!

852
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,530
No, no, no. No.

853
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:03,533
It's their only chance.

854
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:05,577
Rick, it's insane.

855
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,871
It's unethical. It's...

856
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,706
It's illegal, all right?

857
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,499
And anyway,
it just wouldn't work.

858
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,352
Well, you don't know that.
It's never been done before.

859
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:14,628
No, you'll kill 'em.

860
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,506
They're gonna die anyway.

861
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:22,844
Look, I mean...

862
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:25,931
we've tried.

863
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:28,016
We... We've thought
of everything.

864
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,728
Yeah, so you called
Doctor Harry.

865
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:39,194
I didn't come here
to kill kids, Rick.

866
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:41,404
I came here
to help you save 'em.

867
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:42,948
- Okay.
- Yeah?

868
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,491
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

869
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,785
I mean, we're...
We're just desperate.

870
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:47,953
- It's a bad idea.
- Yeah.

871
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:50,163
- It's the only idea.
- Leave it, Rick.

872
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,498
Yeah. Harry's the expert.

873
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,581
If he says it can't be done,
then it can't be done.

874
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,338
Anything else I can do,

875
01:10:58,421 --> 01:10:59,965
- I will do.
- Sure.

876
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:01,967
Obviously, I took an oath,
and I...

877
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,093
Understood.

878
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,719
- We'll just keep exploring.
- Yeah?

879
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:06,003
- Yeah. Keep exploring.
- Yeah.

880
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:07,531
It's good to have you
on board, Harry.

881
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,555
Okay.

882
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,107
Oh, Rick.

883
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:20,610
As the oxygen level decreases
in the cave,

884
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:23,947
Thai Navy SEALs are doubling their efforts
to help the trapped boys.

885
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,993
The air we breathe contains about
twenty-one percent oxygen.

886
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,620
The level in the cave
is less than sixteen percent.

887
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,123
Sam an.

888
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,206
You okay?

889
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,797
Thanks for letting me
take wetsuits to the boys.

890
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,046
I'm happy you could lend a hand.

891
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:41,881
I'll help.

892
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:58,815
Thanks Sam an.

893
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:00,066
Mmm.

894
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:36,568
<i>The recent death</i>

895
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,220

897
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,849

898

<i>This was a trained Navy diver.</i>

899
01:16:44,559 --> 01:16:45,852
As for Saman's funeral,

900
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:47,663
the government will arrange
a funeral with full honors.

901

909
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:14,422
Call me back. Yeah.

910
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:18,343
There will be
no more Navy divers

911
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:22,013
going beyond Chamber 3
until further notice.

912
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:39,238
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

913
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,949
Hi, hun.

914
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,410
Jesus Christ.

915
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,381
Hey, Matthew. It's Dad.

916
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:58,466
<i>Dad!
Are you coming home?</i>

917
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:02,553
Uh, not for a few days yet.

918
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:04,806
<i>We heard someone died out there.</i>

919
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:06,808
Yeah, yeah,
one of the Thai divers.

920
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:09,727
A fellow named Sam an.
He was...

921
01:18:09,811 --> 01:18:13,231
He was just helping out, and...

922
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:15,441
Yeah, yeah, it's sad.

923
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,028
<i>Do you think
you'll get the boys out?</i>

924
01:18:19,112 --> 01:18:20,279
We will if we can.

925
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:24,158
We're just trying
to figure it out.

926
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:27,620
I mean, it's complicated,

927
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,823
but we're trying...
We're trying to figure it out now.

928
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:35,128
Uh, anyway,
how are things with you?

929
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,546
You doin' okay?

930
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:41,634
Do you want one?

931
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,719
Uh, no.

932
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:47,014
I just found out my dad's been
taken to a hospital.

933
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:48,599
So, they're just running
a few tests.

934
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:50,309
His heart's never been
very good.

935
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,479
Sorry to hear about that.

936
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:55,273
He's pretty tough.

937
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,692
He's made it to 88.

938
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:01,320
Um, listen.

939
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,742
If we had the right backup,

940
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,329
maybe, just maybe

941
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:13,416
one or two or three,
if we're lucky,

942
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,501
of those kids
might just make it through.

943
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:20,256
But you're talking about
a five-hour dive.

944
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:21,799
- Right.
- That means that

945
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:24,927
they're gonna have to have
top-up shots along the way.

946
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:26,846
And then you got
the saliva problem.

947
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,264
Even if the masks hold,

948
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,390
there's a very good chance

949
01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:30,659
they're gonna choke, all right?

950
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,351
The whole thing is insane.

951
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,061
I don't even know
why I'm saying it.

952
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:35,771
'Cause a man's already died.

953
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:39,982
- Yeah.
- And those kids don't have much time left.

954
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,278
Harry.

955
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,322
We do nothing,

956
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:45,965
we'll be bringin' 'em
out dead for sure.

957
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:49,585
But if they die
while we're bringin' 'em out,

958
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:51,954
at least we will have tried.

959
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:08,386
Sedated?

960
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:10,640
How sedated?

961
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:17,188
Fully. Fully unconscious.

962
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,232
It's the only way
we can dive them out.

963
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:20,483
Mmm.

964
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,151
They have to be inert.

965
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:23,694
Completely still.

966
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:26,405
We'll take them out
like packages.

967
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:31,035
And you are an anesthetist?

968
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,621
Yes. Yes, I am.

969
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:35,956
Preeya.

970
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:37,917
Don't write this down.

971
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,379
How safe is this procedure?

972
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:51,180
I just can't answer that.

973
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:52,640
Because I've never
done it before.

974
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,644
As far as I know,
nobody ever has.

975
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:00,565
In...

976
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,610
In theory, it could work.

977
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:11,450
But we're talking about
administering anesthetics

978
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:15,246
under conditions where we just
can't monitor the effect.

979
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:19,834
So, too much

980
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,961
and respiration
can just shut down.

981
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:25,715
And too little and, uh...

982
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:29,677
If they wake up under water,

983
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:33,389
they can drown.

984
01:21:38,269 --> 01:21:41,606
So, you are expecting,
uh, casualties?

985
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:44,859
Yes. I expect casualties.

986
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,694
Minister, here!

987
01:21:50,031 --> 01:21:51,031
Governor!

988
01:21:52,617 --> 01:21:54,410
The minister is coming.

989
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,081
Governor,
over here! Sir!

990
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:13,679
The operation may now proceed.

991
01:22:17,892 --> 01:22:19,060
Yes, Minister.

992
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:28,694
May you be successful.

993
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:40,581
No one must know about the...

994
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,334
the method you propose.

995
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,587
Not even the parents.

996
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:50,675
Do your best.

997
01:22:52,218 --> 01:22:53,344
And if we fail,

998
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:57,765
the failure is mine alone.

999
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:03,937
Okay.

1000
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:16,951
Your volunteering
and effort is critical.

1001
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:20,663
The faster the waterways can be diverted
before the monsoons return,

1002
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:23,165
the more time
we can buy for the boys.

1003
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:26,127
They're telling us
the dams are helping.

1004
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,713
It makes it possible for the
divers to reach the boys.

1005
01:23:28,796 --> 01:23:30,923
But if we don't build enough,

1006
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,301
when the monsoons arrive,
the boys will drown.

1007
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:40,367
<i>...not
involved in the operation,</i>

1008
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:42,518
<i>please kindly leave
the base camp area.</i>

1009
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:52,027
<i>Attention, please.</i>

1010
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,780
<i>All media and those
not involved in the operation,</i>

1011
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:56,782
<i>please leave the base camp area.</i>

1012
01:23:58,617 --> 01:23:59,618
What's going on?

1013
01:24:00,745 --> 01:24:03,497
It's the TV guys, the news guys,

1014
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:05,124
they're all being sent away.

1015
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,252
So they don't see
the bodies come out.

1016
01:24:16,761 --> 01:24:17,821
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1017
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:24,911
Sorry, I don't understand.

1018
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,479
For you, for the boys.

1019
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,272
From Chai's mom, Buahom.

1020
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,358
- Buahom?
- Yes, yes, yes.

1021
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:32,651
Blessed by the holy man.

1022
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:35,446
Okay. John.

1023
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:38,783
Thank you.

1024
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,077
Here. For good luck.

1025
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:47,958
Don't believe in luck.

1026
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:49,882
Just take it, take it.
She's watching, come on.

1027
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:03,182
All right.
We'll be having to give them

1028
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:06,268
repeat hits of Ketamine
along the way.

1029
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:08,645
We're givin' 'em ket?

1030
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,230
Yeah.

1031
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,901
Now, the injection goes
through the wet suit,

1032
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,237
into the thigh muscle here
or here.

1033
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:20,366
Each dose should last
about 30 minutes.

1034
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,244
Keep a little bit of, see,
space on the needle there.

1035
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,995
Push in and out.

1036
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:26,580
It's quite simple.

1037
01:25:26,664 --> 01:25:28,374
But when they start waking,

1038
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:31,418
you guys are gonna have to
top 'em up immediately. Yeah?

1039
01:25:31,502 --> 01:25:33,045
Boss.

1040
01:25:34,088 --> 01:25:35,589
Well done, Jas.

1041
01:25:35,673 --> 01:25:37,424
Just try again.

1042
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:52,231
- Good luck.
- Hmm.

1043
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:53,474
Good luck to us all, Captain.

1044
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:54,775
- John.
- Captain.

1045
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:21,802
I pray to the Guardian Spirit
of the forest

1046
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:27,349
to apologize
for the thirteen boys.

1047
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:29,685
If they have offended you,

1048
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:32,771
intentionally
or unintentionally,

1049
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,233
I apologize

1050
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:39,528
to all spirits in the forest.

1051
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:42,615
And spirits everywhere.

1052
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:47,995
Everyone at the ceremony
would like to pray

1053
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:52,249
for the thirteen young boys

1054
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:55,294
to come back home safely.

1055
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:24,823
It's Chamber 5, lads.

1056
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:28,577
The SEALs ran electric cable.
Got some lights in here.

1057
01:27:28,661 --> 01:27:30,204
Roughly halfway.

1058
01:27:31,205 --> 01:27:32,748
These are spare tanks

1059
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,333
the SEALs brought in
for the boys.

1060
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:35,501
Copy.

1061
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,711
Josh, you and Connor
wait for us here.

1062
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:39,129
Right, mate, yeah.

1063
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:10,285
All right, I stop here.

1064
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:14,790
When the first boy
gets through the long dive,

1065
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:16,417
I swim to you and report.

1066
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,751
'Cause if it's not working out,

1067
01:28:17,835 --> 01:28:19,920
we need to know
before we bring any more out.

1068
01:28:20,004 --> 01:28:21,380
But if it is workin'...

1069
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:22,783
- Then we get on with it.
- Right.

1070
01:28:23,257 --> 01:28:24,758
They're packages.

1071
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:26,885
We're just the delivery guys.

1072
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,680
Right.

1073
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:32,641
Okay, lads. Let's do it.

1074
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:34,059
Yep. Let's go.

1075
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:36,729
Good luck.

1076
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:38,396
Good luck, Harry.

1077
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:52,493
This will sting a little.

1078
01:29:24,485 --> 01:29:26,111
Today's the day.

1079
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:27,863
We're gonna start diving
the boys out.

1080
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:29,364
We can take four.

1081
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:33,272
They are taking us out today.
But they can only take four.

1082
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:34,994
They're taking us out.

1083
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:48,383
From your mom.

1084
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,345
Blessed by Kruba.

1085
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:53,956
- Doctor Karn.
- Yeah.

1086
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:55,474
This is Doctor Harris.
Doctor Karn.

1087
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:57,101
Hey.

1088
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:58,864
- Doctor Harry.
- Doctor Karn.

1089
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,438
Doctor, um,

1090
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:05,651
you need to know
what we're proposing here.

1091
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,569
That's for you.

1092
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:27,047
So, who's going first?

1093
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:31,592
Chai,

1094
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:33,303
Arm,

1095
01:30:33,387 --> 01:30:34,387
Aat,

1096
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:35,555
Poom.

1097
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:37,599
Chai, you go first.

1098
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:44,356
Guess I am first.

1099
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,613
All right, chin in.

1100
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:57,786
- Uh... No way. No.
- No?

1101
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,205
No way, it's not gonna seal.

1102
01:31:00,289 --> 01:31:01,558
We'll get you a better mask.

1103
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:05,002
They have to find a mask
to fit you.

1104
01:31:06,587 --> 01:31:07,587
Today?

1105
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,173
Probably tomorrow.

1106
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:11,025
It's gonna be
okay. It's gonna be okay.

1107
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:12,050
I promise.

1108
01:31:12,885 --> 01:31:13,969
Good lad.

1109
01:31:14,052 --> 01:31:16,305
Decha, you go.

1110
01:31:19,016 --> 01:31:20,392
Ready to go.

1111
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:28,941
Open your mouth, Decha.

1112
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:51,965
Arms up.

1113
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:05,455
Turn about.

1114
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,359
You'll be home soon.

1115
01:32:12,069 --> 01:32:13,987
He's tying Decha's hands.

1116
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,290
It will be okay.

1117
01:32:25,374 --> 01:32:27,251
Don't let the boys watch.

1118
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:28,937
There's no need to scare them
with needles.

1119
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:30,921
Step in front. Good lad.

1120
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,716
Move back, turn around.

1121
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:38,053
A-ha.

1122
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,264
The lucky first customer.

1123
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:42,057
Come on.

1124
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,684
Yep. Steady as you go.

1125
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:44,851
Here we go.

1126
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:46,812
Come into my comfy office.

1127
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:49,273
Now, I'm Harry.

1128
01:32:49,356 --> 01:32:51,942
And you're a very brave boy,
you're number one.

1129
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:54,236
And you're lucky,
'cause you get Jason.

1130
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:58,699
He is the number one diver
in all the world.

1131
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:01,767
Have you been missing
the World Cup?

1132
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,746
Huh? Well, guess what?

1133
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:07,332
Brazil got knocked out, huh?

1134
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:08,768
You would've seen
one of these before.

1135
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,669
That was a shock, wasn't it?

1136
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:12,629
Brazil, huh?

1137
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:13,753
Guess who knocked 'em out?

1138
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:15,340
Belgium.

1139
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:20,887
Bet they're really upset
about that.

1140
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:21,971
Belgium.

1141
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:24,349
Get you out of here so that

1142
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:27,728
you can watch
the rest of the games, huh?

1143
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:32,566
Mmm. Tough guy, huh?

1144
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:33,900
Didn't even feel that one.

1145
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:35,777
Mmm.

1146
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:39,156
Easy, huh? Easy.

1147
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:42,367
Look away.

1148
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:48,689
Good on the chin.

1149
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:50,310
All right, you wanna take him?

1150
01:33:50,334 --> 01:33:51,460
Yeah, good, good.

1151
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:55,315
All right, good, bring him back.

1152
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,385
Okay, his head back.

1153
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:02,679
Most certainly.

1154
01:34:02,763 --> 01:34:03,923
- Good.
- Yeah.

1155
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:08,352
- Slow.
- Good.

1156
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,359
Let's pull that back.

1157
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:16,922
All right, check for breathing.

1158
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:17,986
All right.

1159
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:37,838
Looks good.

1160
01:34:38,507 --> 01:34:39,591
Feet.

1161
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:55,524
Okay.

1162
01:34:55,857 --> 01:34:57,025
Okay.

1163
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:09,117
He's been breathing just fine.

1164
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:11,600
Fucking brilliant.

1165
01:36:14,394 --> 01:36:15,979
You didn't think it would work?

1166
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,485
Me neither.

1167
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:27,240
All right. I'm off.

1168
01:36:27,324 --> 01:36:28,492
Good luck.

1169
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:33,416
And look,
you're lucky because see this?

1170
01:36:33,497 --> 01:36:34,831
That's John.

1171
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:36,082
He's diving you out

1172
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:39,377
and he is the number one diver

1173
01:36:40,337 --> 01:36:41,755
in the whole world.

1174
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,548
And I know
it's been pretty exciting

1175
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:45,342
for you in here, but guess what?

1176
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:46,569
Bit of excitement
in the World Cup.

1177
01:36:46,593 --> 01:36:49,763
Belgium knocked out Brazil.

1178
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:52,140
Harry, Harry.
Did you give him the shot?

1179
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:54,142
Oh, shit.

1180
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:55,411
We were supposed to wait
till we heard

1181
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:56,937
Jason made it out okay.

1182
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,481
Yeah. I've done the atropine,
and I'm gonna have to...

1183
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:00,732
I'm gonna have to keep going.

1184
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:03,568
No panic. No panic.
Yeah.

1185
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:04,486
Yeah, carry on.

1186
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:05,654
We gotta get on with it.

1187
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,137
I don't wanna risk
my boy waking up.

1188
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:10,909
Not so bad, huh?

1189
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:13,328
- Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1190
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:24,046
Good.

1191
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:27,759
Kiet, you know my lad's name?

1192
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:29,135
- Arm.
- Arm?

1193
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:30,595
He's the team captain.

1194
01:37:33,557 --> 01:37:34,599
Okay.

1195
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:48,822
It's working.

1196
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:04,856
Oh, jeez.

1197
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:40,892
Yeah, he's good.

1198
01:39:49,234 --> 01:39:50,276
See you out there.

1199
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1200
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:54,948
Good luck, Chris.

1201
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:11,342
- Jason okay?
- Jason's through.

1202
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:12,381
Good.

1203
01:40:12,424 --> 01:40:13,526
- Careful.
- Okay.

1204
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:14,551
Yeah, easy, easy.

1205
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:15,677
- Slow, slow, slow.
- Okay.

1206
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,987
- Slowly, slowly.
- New cylinder.

1207
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,091
I'll give him another dose.

1208
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:22,517
Okay,
so I've got him. Okay.

1209
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:23,619
- Coming off.
- Okay.

1210
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:24,644
He all right?

1211
01:40:25,478 --> 01:40:26,771
Nice. Boy's good.

1212
01:40:26,855 --> 01:40:28,565
All right, let's bring him over.

1213
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:30,650
All right. Step.

1214
01:40:30,734 --> 01:40:31,901
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1215
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:34,863
- Careful.
- Yep.

1216
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:35,986
Turning him around.

1217
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:46,875
Okay.

1218
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,127
There we go.

1219
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,421
One, two, three.
Turn him over.

1220
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:01,639
No, he's not breathing.

1221
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:09,522
No, he's okay.

1222
01:41:09,606 --> 01:41:11,274
He's okay. He's breathing.

1223
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:12,357
Okay.

1224
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,194
Yeah. Again.

1225
01:41:14,277 --> 01:41:15,820
- Yep.
- Yeah. Slowly.

1226
01:41:24,871 --> 01:41:26,956
Fuck! He's not breathing.

1227
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,041
No. Mask off.

1228
01:41:29,042 --> 01:41:30,960
- Mask off.
- Easy.

1229
01:41:31,044 --> 01:41:33,004
- Here we go.
- Easy, easy.

1230
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:35,507
Okay.
Right, that's it. Mask off.

1231
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,842
Okay. Gettin' there.

1232
01:41:37,926 --> 01:41:40,678
Okay, let me in.
Okay...

1233
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:51,146
Breathe.

1234
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:52,857
Breathe.

1235
01:41:56,486 --> 01:41:57,487
Okay, he's breathing.

1236
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:00,865
Every time I put him
under the water, he stops.

1237
01:42:00,949 --> 01:42:01,991
You all right?

1238
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:03,660
Yep. Okay.

1239
01:42:04,828 --> 01:42:05,954
Mask on.

1240
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:07,037
Okay.

1241
01:42:11,251 --> 01:42:12,252
All right. Steady.

1242
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:16,631
Good work, Josh.

1243
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,554
- Okay.
- Good luck.

1244
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:23,179
John, you okay?

1245
01:42:23,263 --> 01:42:25,807
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just give me a minute, please.

1246
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,308
Is he all right?

1247
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:29,060
He's all right.

1248
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:31,813
Hey, is he, uh,
still breathing okay?

1249
01:42:31,896 --> 01:42:33,648
Yeah. Yeah.

1250
01:42:35,275 --> 01:42:36,317
Okay.

1251
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:38,903
Yeah, bring him over.

1252
01:42:41,948 --> 01:42:43,408
Okay.

1253
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:45,451
Okay, Arm. Gentle.

1254
01:42:56,713 --> 01:42:58,339
Yeah, he's good.

1255
01:43:00,383 --> 01:43:01,384
All right.

1256
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:05,096
- Thanks, boys.
- Cheers.

1257
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:17,543
Okay, let's go, let's go!

1258
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:21,779
Watch the head!

1259
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:29,805
Everybody,
get ready to take that.

1260
01:43:29,829 --> 01:43:31,080
One, two, three.

1261
01:43:31,164 --> 01:43:32,206
Faster, faster.

1262
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:38,838
Gently.

1263
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:44,594
How is he?

1264
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:46,429
He's still breathing.

1265
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:53,227
Careful with his head.

1266
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:57,357
Oxygen coming.

1267
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,751
Make sure you're ready.

1268
01:43:58,775 --> 01:44:00,026
Got shallow breaths.

1269
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:02,278
Okay!

1270
01:44:02,362 --> 01:44:03,464
Let's go, let's go!

1271
01:44:04,405 --> 01:44:05,698
Vital signs are stable.

1272
01:44:05,782 --> 01:44:07,843
Okay,
nice and easy, nice and easy.

1273
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:08,868
Easy, guys.

1274
01:44:13,206 --> 01:44:14,766
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

1275
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,335
Get him out, get him out.

1276
01:45:22,025 --> 01:45:23,109
A boy is coming out!

1277
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:33,637
The Governor asked me
to tell everyone

1278
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:35,413
the rescue is going well so far.

1279
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:37,165
Why can't we have names?

1280
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:41,419
I'm afraid
we can't release any details.

1281
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:46,299
I know how hard it must
be for all of you

1282
01:45:46,382 --> 01:45:49,469
but when the operation is complete,
you'll be the first to know.

1283
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:52,305
Why does it have to be a secret?

1284
01:46:45,775 --> 01:46:46,776
Okay.

1285
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:48,003
Ready, we're ready.

1286
01:46:49,654 --> 01:46:50,988
Yeah, he's okay. He's okay.

1287
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:53,323
Good.

1288
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:55,284
Careful.

1289
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:07,481
- John.
- Jason.

1290
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:14,780
You okay?

1291
01:48:14,864 --> 01:48:15,907
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1292
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,658
That was, uh...

1293
01:48:17,742 --> 01:48:19,243
It's tough.

1294
01:48:23,748 --> 01:48:24,748
Hey, John.

1295
01:48:26,292 --> 01:48:28,044
- John?
- Yeah?

1296
01:48:28,127 --> 01:48:30,963
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1297
01:48:31,047 --> 01:48:34,592
It's just, uh,
my lad was called Arm...

1298
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:36,235
Well, he stopped breathing
for a minute.

1299
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:39,138
I thought he...
I thought he was...

1300
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:42,767
But he's not. He's okay.
He's okay.

1301
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,685
Well done, Chris.
It's not easy.

1302
01:48:45,478 --> 01:48:46,938
Thanks, John. Thanks.

1303
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:13,089
Medic. Medic?

1304
01:49:15,174 --> 01:49:16,526
Um, what happened?

1305
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:18,469
It was four out of four, Doctor.

1306
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,012
Four what?

1307
01:49:20,096 --> 01:49:21,514
All the boys are fine.

1308
01:49:23,808 --> 01:49:24,808
Great job.

1309
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:26,769
Yeah.

1310
01:50:00,428 --> 01:50:01,571
<i>We understand</i>

1311
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:03,097
<i>that a team of elite divers</i>

1312
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:04,724
<i>is attempting to guide the boys</i>

1313
01:50:04,807 --> 01:50:07,476
<i>through a three-kilometer
underwater swim to safety.</i>

1314
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,145
"Swim to safety."

1315
01:50:09,228 --> 01:50:10,563
I like that.

1316
01:50:14,317 --> 01:50:16,610
Got any custard creams left?

1317
01:50:16,694 --> 01:50:17,987
No.

1318
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:19,363
What do you have?

1319
01:50:19,447 --> 01:50:20,698
I ate them all.

1320
01:50:20,781 --> 01:50:21,949
- Knob.
<i>- The media</i>

1321
01:50:22,033 --> 01:50:24,076
<i>were relocated
to clear additional space</i>

1322
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:27,204
<i>for essential military
and volunteer personnel.</i>

1323
01:50:27,288 --> 01:50:29,665
<i>The rescue operation
is shrouded in secrecy...</i>

1324
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:34,545
Yesterday, they said
if we got one boy out alive,

1325
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:35,963
we'd be heroes.

1326
01:50:39,592 --> 01:50:41,510
Now, we bring
a single one out dead...

1327
01:50:46,891 --> 01:50:47,892
Yeah.

1328
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:02,323
The air tanks are all
strategically placed along the route.

1329
01:51:02,406 --> 01:51:07,036
During yesterday's rescue,
they used every single tank.

1330
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:11,624
The Governor
of Chiang Rai Province

1331
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:13,793
called this,
"A War With Water."

1332
01:51:13,876 --> 01:51:17,838
Local forecasting
is predicting heavy rain.

1333
01:51:17,922 --> 01:51:19,608
No need to be scared, Rit.

1334
01:51:19,632 --> 01:51:20,716
You know why?

1335
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,968
Because you have the best diver.

1336
01:51:23,052 --> 01:51:24,178
Ready? Look up.

1337
01:51:26,097 --> 01:51:27,848
Good boy.

1338
01:51:27,932 --> 01:51:29,183
See? All over.

1339
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:30,643
All over.

1340
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:32,436
There you go. Good boy.

1341
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:36,774
I am Dew.

1342
01:51:36,857 --> 01:51:38,109
I'm Rick.

1343
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:06,220
Bring down more pipe!

1344
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,098
There's no more!

1345
01:52:10,099 --> 01:52:11,259
Is that the last of the pipe?

1346
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:12,643
We've sent for more
from Bangkok.

1347
01:52:13,978 --> 01:52:15,020
Need more pipe?

1348
01:52:29,076 --> 01:52:30,286
Pipe.

1349
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:00,375
Yeah, they're good.

1350
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:02,067
- Okay.
- Sixth is on the Skedco.

1351
01:53:04,737 --> 01:53:08,908
We're hearing that five boys
have been brought out of the cave today.

1352
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:13,704
Recent weather reports show
storm clouds on the horizon.

1353
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:19,710
The monsoon season
is closing in fast.

1354
01:53:29,929 --> 01:53:31,289
Hell yeah, man!

1355
01:53:31,347 --> 01:53:32,932
Yeah!

1356
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:50,908
Mask for Chai.

1357
01:53:50,991 --> 01:53:52,785
Flown in from Bangkok.

1358
01:53:52,868 --> 01:53:53,868
All right.

1359
01:53:55,037 --> 01:53:56,037
Nah.

1360
01:53:57,581 --> 01:53:58,666
Ah!

1361
01:54:03,254 --> 01:54:05,130
Think it'll fit?

1362
01:54:05,214 --> 01:54:06,757
Yeah, it better do.
It is smaller.

1363
01:54:07,424 --> 01:54:08,424
Have a seat, Bas.

1364
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:10,803
Thank you.

1365
01:55:04,481 --> 01:55:05,542
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

1366
01:55:05,566 --> 01:55:06,886
You wanna
keep it like that, okay?

1367
01:55:14,283 --> 01:55:16,285
That's a lot of water.

1368
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:48,233
Water level's
gonna be rising in there.

1369
01:55:48,317 --> 01:55:49,860
For sure.

1370
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:51,129
We'll still make it through,
though, right?

1371
01:55:51,153 --> 01:55:52,488
Don't know.

1372
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:54,782
We dive and we find out.

1373
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:56,617
It depends, Jason.

1374
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,678
Rick and I have been in there
when it's fully flooded.

1375
01:55:58,702 --> 01:56:00,204
It's a beast.

1376
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:03,499
Come on.
We're not stopping now.

1377
01:56:03,582 --> 01:56:06,251
You die in a cave
if you want to, Jason.

1378
01:56:06,335 --> 01:56:08,671
If I'm not sure of coming out,
I'm not going in.

1379
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:28,107
Hurry.

1380
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,693
It won't stop raining.
We need more sandbags.

1381
01:56:30,776 --> 01:56:34,405
Everyone, there are three sinkholes
in the rocks to the east.

1382
01:57:19,992 --> 01:57:22,703
Okay. We can make it.

1383
01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:24,830
- We better move fast.
- Okay, lads.

1384
01:57:28,625 --> 01:57:29,793
All right, Harry.

1385
01:57:48,437 --> 01:57:49,581
Everyone leaves today.

1386
01:57:49,605 --> 01:57:51,005
We do this as fast as we can.

1387
01:57:52,649 --> 01:57:53,650
All right.

1388
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:00,407
No, see, that's open.
It's not gonna seal.

1389
01:58:00,491 --> 01:58:02,534
Yeah. It's buckling.

1390
01:58:02,618 --> 01:58:04,620
All right,
let's dive the others out.

1391
01:58:04,703 --> 01:58:06,580
Then we'll get him sorted.
Yeah?

1392
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:10,000
Okay, I got this.
It's pink. I like it.

1393
01:58:10,083 --> 01:58:12,211
All right, so, who's next?

1394
01:58:13,212 --> 01:58:14,338
I can't swim.

1395
01:58:15,005 --> 01:58:16,924
Will we survive?

1396
01:58:17,007 --> 01:58:19,885
Don't be afraid.
We have to trust them.

1397
01:58:23,222 --> 01:58:24,264
Okay.

1398
01:58:27,476 --> 01:58:28,644
Okay, turn around.

1399
01:58:32,773 --> 01:58:33,982
Who have we got here?

1400
01:58:34,066 --> 01:58:35,651
- This is Prem.
- Prem.

1401
01:58:35,734 --> 01:58:37,494
Come on down, Prem.
Let's get you outta here.

1402
01:58:38,362 --> 01:58:40,531
Are we the last to go?

1403
01:58:40,614 --> 01:58:41,990
Mmm.

1404
01:58:42,074 --> 01:58:43,301
Chris is diving you out.

1405
01:58:43,325 --> 01:58:44,993
You know, Chris, see,

1406
01:58:45,077 --> 01:58:48,372
he's the number one rescue
diver in the whole world.

1407
01:58:48,455 --> 01:58:49,623
That's me.

1408
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:51,684
All right. Prem, you know
the drill. You've seen this.

1409
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:53,293
Do you wanna look up? Ready?

1410
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:01,426
All right. Yep.

1411
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:02,719
Off you go.

1412
01:59:18,735 --> 01:59:20,362
All right. One more to go.

1413
01:59:21,864 --> 01:59:23,782
Your choice. Up or down?

1414
01:59:23,866 --> 01:59:25,951
Up.

1415
01:59:26,034 --> 01:59:28,036
There you go.
That was pretty painless.

1416
01:59:29,705 --> 01:59:32,082
We're gonna get you home.
Maybe for dinner.

1417
01:59:32,916 --> 01:59:33,917
Hmm?

1418
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,671
Hmm.

1419
01:59:45,429 --> 01:59:46,698
It's the best we can do.

1420
01:59:46,722 --> 01:59:48,765
If I pull it too tight,
it'll collapse the seal.

1421
01:59:48,849 --> 01:59:50,434
It's still a little loose.

1422
01:59:50,517 --> 01:59:52,269
We don't have time.
The water is rising.

1423
01:59:52,352 --> 01:59:54,232
If he doesn't come out now,
he doesn't come out.

1424
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:57,691
I'll keep it from bumping.

1425
01:59:57,774 --> 01:59:58,942
I can hold it if I have to.

1426
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:04,156
It's your call.

1427
02:00:04,823 --> 02:00:06,116
I'll be going slow.

1428
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:07,784
So give me some space
before you follow.

1429
02:00:27,804 --> 02:00:29,348
The boys?

1430
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:31,224
Are they out safely?

1431
02:00:32,017 --> 02:00:34,770
We hope so. Your turn now.

1432
02:01:03,298 --> 02:01:05,258
He's no heavier than the boys.

1433
02:01:07,427 --> 02:01:08,720
I'll be right behind you.

1434
02:01:08,804 --> 02:01:10,222
Not too close.

1435
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:12,849
See you at the pub.

1436
02:02:29,301 --> 02:02:31,720
All right.
I guess it's our turn now.

1437
02:02:31,803 --> 02:02:33,764
You go. We follow.

1438
02:02:33,847 --> 02:02:36,058
Yeah. I mean, remember,

1439
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:38,643
the current is much stronger
than it was.

1440
02:02:38,727 --> 02:02:41,021
- And the water is, you know.
- Yeah.

1441
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:47,486
The clock is ticking,
putting pressure on the rescue team.

1442
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:52,491
The fear is the heavy downpour
will push water back into the cave

1443
02:02:52,574 --> 02:02:58,246
faster than the volunteers
can divert the rain from the mountain.

1444
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:03,470
Yes, one more, one more.

1445
02:03:15,347 --> 02:03:16,848
Hello?

1446
02:03:16,932 --> 02:03:18,016
Hello, hello, hello!

1447
02:03:19,392 --> 02:03:21,353
Okay. Okay.

1448
02:03:21,436 --> 02:03:23,063
Okay. Okay.

1449
02:03:41,081 --> 02:03:43,083
Yeah, come on.
Keep his head up.

1450
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:45,001
Start cutting
through the next one.

1451
02:03:45,669 --> 02:03:46,795
Reset for 11.

1452
02:04:21,997 --> 02:04:23,415
Okay, Jason.

1453
02:04:23,498 --> 02:04:25,417
I've got him.

1454
02:04:38,013 --> 02:04:39,848
Okay? Three, two...

1455
02:04:40,849 --> 02:04:43,226
He's good. He's good.

1456
02:04:48,315 --> 02:04:49,675
Steady now, lads.

1457
02:04:53,153 --> 02:04:54,193
We got a visual.

1458
02:05:16,593 --> 02:05:17,593
Chris.

1459
02:05:18,553 --> 02:05:19,553
Rick.

1460
02:05:21,932 --> 02:05:23,642
It's really good to see you.

1461
02:05:23,725 --> 02:05:25,810
I didn't know if anyone
was gonna be able to...

1462
02:05:25,894 --> 02:05:27,604
Is he alive?

1463
02:05:27,687 --> 02:05:29,022
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1464
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:30,899
No, yeah, he is, yeah. I...

1465
02:05:30,982 --> 02:05:32,776
I lost the line back there.

1466
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:34,945
I found a power cable
and followed it here.

1467
02:05:35,779 --> 02:05:37,364
I, uh...

1468
02:05:37,447 --> 02:05:38,573
I don't know where I am.

1469
02:05:38,657 --> 02:05:40,075
You're still in Chamber 4.

1470
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:41,201
Well done.

1471
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:45,163
Keep him topped up.

1472
02:05:46,122 --> 02:05:47,415
You'll be fine.

1473
02:05:47,499 --> 02:05:49,918
Wait for Harry.
He's coming now.

1474
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:51,294
Let him have a look, yeah?

1475
02:05:51,378 --> 02:05:53,046
Yeah. Yeah.

1476
02:05:53,129 --> 02:05:55,382
Your only duty is to that boy.

1477
02:05:55,465 --> 02:05:56,716
We'll get you out.

1478
02:05:58,593 --> 02:05:59,803
So get ready.

1479
02:05:59,886 --> 02:06:01,471
Yeah. Okay.

1480
02:06:01,554 --> 02:06:03,265
Put his mask on

1481
02:06:03,348 --> 02:06:06,351
and do whatever Harry says
is best. Got it?

1482
02:06:08,687 --> 02:06:10,522
See you on the other side.

1483
02:06:47,183 --> 02:06:48,476
Where's Chris?

1484
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,854
- Still in Chamber 4.
- Okay.

1485
02:06:50,937 --> 02:06:52,605
- Coach is breathing.
- Okay.

1486
02:06:55,734 --> 02:06:56,961
Hey, hey, hey.
Mister John.

1487
02:06:56,985 --> 02:06:58,713
- He's fine, he's fine.
- Okay.

1488
02:06:58,737 --> 02:07:00,363
Easy with him.

1489
02:07:01,448 --> 02:07:03,158
Coach looks good.

1490
02:07:06,995 --> 02:07:08,371
How's Chris gettin' on?

1491
02:07:10,665 --> 02:07:11,958
He's struggling a bit.

1492
02:07:16,421 --> 02:07:17,756
Told him to wait for Harry.

1493
02:07:35,065 --> 02:07:36,191
Chris?

1494
02:07:36,775 --> 02:07:37,775
Yeah.

1495
02:07:37,817 --> 02:07:39,194
What's happened?

1496
02:07:39,277 --> 02:07:42,697
I, uh... I lost the line.

1497
02:07:42,781 --> 02:07:43,990
Is your boy okay?

1498
02:07:44,074 --> 02:07:45,241
I think so.

1499
02:07:45,325 --> 02:07:47,911
You, uh, might wanna check him.

1500
02:07:47,994 --> 02:07:49,412
Did you give him a top-off?

1501
02:07:49,496 --> 02:07:51,376
Yeah, I gave him one
about an hour ago, I think.

1502
02:07:52,707 --> 02:07:54,167
Yeah, let's give him
another hit.

1503
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:55,293
Okay.

1504
02:07:58,213 --> 02:08:01,174
Do you want me to maybe
take over from here?

1505
02:08:01,841 --> 02:08:04,260
Uh... No, no, no.

1506
02:08:04,344 --> 02:08:05,595
I should... I should do it.

1507
02:08:08,014 --> 02:08:09,014
It's the U-bend.

1508
02:08:09,766 --> 02:08:10,767
Um...

1509
02:08:11,726 --> 02:08:13,478
Well, I mean, Rick said, uh...

1510
02:08:14,896 --> 02:08:17,941
I mean, he just... He said to
just do what you said, so...

1511
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:19,609
Uh...

1512
02:08:19,692 --> 02:08:23,196
Well, I reckon you've done
the hardest part.

1513
02:08:24,364 --> 02:08:25,615
Why don't I do the last bit?

1514
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:28,660
And that way I could say
that I was a rescuer, too.

1515
02:08:30,286 --> 02:08:32,580
I mean, Rick just said to do
what's best for the boy.

1516
02:08:33,957 --> 02:08:36,584
I really think
that that's what's best.

1517
02:08:39,254 --> 02:08:40,922
- Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

1518
02:09:10,410 --> 02:09:11,870
The pump is going!

1519
02:09:13,288 --> 02:09:14,368
The pump's gone!

1520
02:09:15,999 --> 02:09:17,459
Come on, Chris. Come on.

1521
02:09:20,795 --> 02:09:21,795
Harry!

1522
02:09:23,089 --> 02:09:24,883
Is the boy good?

1523
02:09:24,966 --> 02:09:26,259
Yeah, he's fine.

1524
02:09:26,342 --> 02:09:27,677
How about Chris?

1525
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,095
He's right behind me.

1526
02:09:33,308 --> 02:09:35,727
Rick. Rick!

1527
02:09:35,810 --> 02:09:38,521
I'm gonna get my cylinders.
I'll go back for him.

1528
02:09:38,605 --> 02:09:39,647
He'll be here.

1529
02:09:52,785 --> 02:09:54,537
Nice one, Chris!

1530
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:58,917
- Well done.
- Thanks.

1531
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,710
- My boy, is he...
- He's alive.

1532
02:10:02,587 --> 02:10:04,672
We bloody did it, lads!

1533
02:10:07,383 --> 02:10:09,552
- Chris, okay?
- Yeah.

1534
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:13,765
Not all out yet.

1535
02:10:46,839 --> 02:10:48,216
Everyone out!

1536
02:10:49,551 --> 02:10:51,010
The pumps are exploding!

1537
02:11:00,395 --> 02:11:01,729
Hey, hey, hey!

1538
02:11:10,863 --> 02:11:12,615
Pichai.

1539
02:11:16,035 --> 02:11:17,328
Okay.

1540
02:11:22,584 --> 02:11:24,544
Oh.

1541
02:11:24,627 --> 02:11:26,254
Good to see ya.

1542
02:11:39,934 --> 02:11:41,728
Okay.

1543
02:12:48,544 --> 02:12:49,864
Well done, boys.

1544
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:53,716
Well done, old man.

1545
02:12:56,886 --> 02:12:58,471
Good job.

1546
02:12:58,554 --> 02:13:00,306
- Thank you, Rick.
- Thank you, Captain.

1547
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:02,993
- Great work, Captain.

1548
02:13:03,017 --> 02:13:04,953
- Great job, guys.

1549
02:13:04,977 --> 02:13:06,205

1550
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:07,790
- Thank you so much.
- Harry.

1551
02:13:07,814 --> 02:13:09,732
- Legend. Legend, mate.
- Well done, lads.

1552
02:13:51,774 --> 02:13:53,776
Guys, I'm sorry about the...

1553
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:55,194
The line. It just kept...

1554
02:13:57,613 --> 02:13:59,031
Hey, it's okay.

1555
02:14:00,074 --> 02:14:01,743
It's done.

1556
02:14:01,826 --> 02:14:03,911
- Yeah. It worked.
- It's okay, Chris.

1557
02:14:03,995 --> 02:14:07,123
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1558
02:14:07,206 --> 02:14:09,375
I just thought I was gonna
have to leave him in there.

1559
02:14:15,965 --> 02:14:18,259
You all have come from all over.

1560
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:21,596
From the nearby town.

1561
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:24,182
Others, from different
countries around the world.

1562
02:14:25,641 --> 02:14:27,393
You have given your time.

1563
02:14:27,477 --> 02:14:28,603
Your expertise.

1564
02:14:29,604 --> 02:14:32,565
Some, even the rice crops.

1565
02:14:32,648 --> 02:14:34,066
Hello.

1566
02:14:34,150 --> 02:14:36,944
<i>And you ask
for nothing in return.</i>

1567
02:14:37,028 --> 02:14:39,405
<i>But I know that you all did this</i>

1568
02:14:40,031 --> 02:14:41,282
for one reason.

1569
02:14:42,492 --> 02:14:44,202
The love for the boys.

1570
02:14:46,537 --> 02:14:48,164
It's okay.

1571
02:14:50,583 --> 02:14:51,793
We're okay.

1572
02:14:54,921 --> 02:14:55,922
It's good.

1573
02:14:57,215 --> 02:14:58,216
Thank you.

1574
02:15:00,885 --> 02:15:02,685
Thank you very much, guys.

1575
02:15:06,265 --> 02:15:08,105
Governor,
will you be stepping down?

1576
02:15:17,819 --> 02:15:18,921
You're welcome.

1577
02:15:22,573 --> 02:15:23,825
Okay.

1578
02:15:23,908 --> 02:15:25,618
Oh, all right. Yeah.

1579
02:15:27,286 --> 02:15:28,579
Hey.

1580
02:15:28,663 --> 02:15:30,998
Well, you did it, Harry.

1581
02:15:35,837 --> 02:15:38,089
He just got word his dad died.

1582
02:16:11,747 --> 02:16:13,457
That's everyone, sir.

1583
02:16:14,083 --> 02:16:16,085
All but one.

1584
02:16:25,261 --> 02:16:26,470
Hey.

1585
02:16:56,292 --> 02:16:57,292

Hmm.

Chai.

1589
02:17:41,212 --> 02:17:42,212
Hi!

1590
02:18:18,499 --> 02:18:19,542
Say "cheese."

1591
02:18:19,625 --> 02:18:21,377
