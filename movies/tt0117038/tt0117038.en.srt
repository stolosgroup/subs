worry about a thing,

We're taking
Sparky with us.

taking her?

170

She's an expert.

In what?

172
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,291
MALT:  Angels.

I got a flat tire

on the side
of a deserted

on the horizon

Oh, ho.
You better watch it,

208
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,917
DOROTHY:  I think
we should start over.

209
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,375
You know, when something
isn't going well,

210
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,875
it's best just to start over.
I'll go first.

211
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,083
Okay.

212

HUEY:  Oh, no.

214
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,166
He comes up to Huey
in a parking lot
one day.

215
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,083
Huey was eating
a donut,

and he's trying
to kick the-- Trying
to kick him away.

You were trying
to kick the dog?

218
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,375
I wasn't trying
to kick him.

219
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,667
I was trying
to shoo him away
very gently.

220
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:15,959
When Malt
comes out the door,
he looks at the dog,

221
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,250
he stops dead
in his tracks.

222
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,625
It turns out
that Malt was
once a child

223
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,917
who had had a dog
just like that one.

224

Oh, that's so sweet.

225
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,208
Anyway, Malt's eyes
get all teary,

226
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,709
and he pours out
this story all about
his dog, Sparky,

227
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:35,166
which ended up
underneath a tractor tire!

Ha ha ha!

229
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,667
And you know
what Huey did?

230
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:39,792
Huey turns to Malt,
and he says,

231
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,917
"Mr. Malt,
that is amazing!

232

"This dog's name
is Sparky, too!"

In no time at all,
the dog is famous.

He's got his own column.

Are we talking
about an angel here?

We can't be talking
about an angel.

326
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,250
There is no
such thing as an...

327
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,041
Such thing
as an angel.

328
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,417
That is definitely
the weirdest thing
I have ever seen.

329

It is not!

Where has he been?

00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,417
Meaning what?

344
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:52,458
Meaning if he were
a man with wings,

345
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,250
which is
the alternative here,

346
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,583
we would've heard
about him.

347
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,458
He didn't just show up
at his age with wings.

348
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,417
There would've been
a story about him
in the papers.

Yeah, "Birdman of Iowa."

00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,375
It is not angel
versus man with wings.

353
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,000
There are
other possibilities.

It's fairly obvious,
isn't it?

356
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,166
He's a younger man.
She's an older woman.

357

He's after her money.

to take the Milk Bottle,

(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)

1449
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:45,750
FRANK:  Michael!

1450
01:36:59,709 --> 01:37:00,709
Michael, wait!

1451
01:37:09,709 --> 01:37:10,875
Ohh!

1452
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:21,709
What are you
doing here?

1453
01:37:21,709 --> 01:37:26,208
I live here. I live
two blocks from here.

1454
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:27,750
I was on
my way home and,

1455
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,750
I thought I saw--

1456
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:31,875
He came around
this corner.

1457
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:33,875
That corner.

1458
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:46,333
(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)

1459
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:47,875
I love you, Dorothy.

1460
01:37:50,417 --> 01:37:52,250
I love you.

1461
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:54,750
(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)

1462
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:57,750
Marry me.

1463
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,375
No.

1464
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:05,125
Marry me, please?
No.

1465
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:08,959
Marry me, Dorothy.
No.

1466
01:38:08,959 --> 01:38:11,125
(LAUGHING)

1467
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:13,333
Oh, my darling Dorothy,
will you marry me?

1468
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:15,792
Yes. Yes.

1469
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:20,125
(BELLS RINGING)

1470
01:38:25,583 --> 01:38:26,959
Let's go home.

1471
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:46,834
You know, Pansy,
I invented marriage.

1472
01:38:47,709 --> 01:38:48,959
Michael.

1473
01:38:48,959 --> 01:38:50,917
Well, I did.

1474
01:38:50,917 --> 01:38:53,250
Before that,
you should have seen it.

1475
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:55,750
Everybody was so mixed up,
they didn't know what to do.

1476
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:58,834
So I said,
"Have a ceremony."

1477
01:38:58,834 --> 01:39:00,834
Hmm.

1478
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:02,792
Let's go home.

1479
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:20,583
FRANK: Do you
smell something?

1480
01:39:20,583 --> 01:39:21,625
DOROTHY: There's
a bakery near here.
