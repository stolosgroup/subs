00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,490
<i>and said nothing.</i>

153
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,644
<i>Without her, Havana was empty.</i>

154
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,479
<i>I was too.</i>

155
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,316
<i>All my love, all my sadness,</i>

156
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,859
<i>I put it into a song.</i>

157
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,283
<i>It was a song too painful to play.</i>

158
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,867
<i>A song</i>

159
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,496
<i>Marta would never hear.</i>

160
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,961
Here it is, Vivo.

161
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,172
The last song I ever wrote.

162
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,179
Wow. She never got to hear it.

163
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,390
That's so sad.

164
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,602
But now, my friend,
I have the greatest gift in the world.

165
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,270
A second chance!

166
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,896
Second what now?

167
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,984

you're seriously considering this.

202
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,039
Oh, Vivo, you are excited too, eh?

203
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,666
No! I'm not excited.

204
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,960
We're not Miami guys.
We're small-town guys.

205
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:00,005
- We're plaza guys.
- Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

206
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,715
Catch!

207
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,971
Hey!

208
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,770
Listen, Vivo.

209
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,648
I must deliver this song to Marta.

210
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,317
She needs to know that I love her.

211
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,028
It's only one song.

212
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,865
I need you, my son!

213
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,369
Hey, Vivo, where are you going?

214
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,913
Mmm...

215
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,166
Ay, Vivo.

216
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,383
What is he thinking?
A plane trip to Miami.

217
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,470
It's been 60 years, and you go
all the way there for one show?

218
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,014
For one song?

219
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,267
What difference can one song make?

220
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,362
What am I doing?

221
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,073
Come on, Vivo.

222
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,808
That suitcase isn't gonna pack itself.

223
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,827
Okay.

224
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,750
Beautiful day to travel.

225
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,378
Good morning.

226
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,049
Look, I'm really sorry about last night.

227
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,884
But I think we...

228
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,221
Andrés?

229
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,185
Oof!

230
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,944
Havana lost a good friend
in Andrés Hernández.

231
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,698
For years, the sound of his <i>tres</i>
filled this plaza

232
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,992
and our hearts.

233
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,285
We were all so excited

234
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,331
for news that he would soon be reunited
with Marta Sandoval.

235
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,710
But alas, it was not meant to be.

236
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,172
<i>Ay, señora</i>.

237
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,596
<i>Ay</i>, <i>muchas gracias</i>.

238
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
My name is Rosa Hernández.

239
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,812
Andrés was my late husband's uncle.

240
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,773
My daughter Gabriela and I
are from Florida.

241
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,441
This is our first trip to Cuba.

242
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,361
Psst. Hey. That's my mom.

243
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,198
My name is Gabi.

244
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,200
You're Vivo, right?

245
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,245
Hey, I know what you're going through.

246
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,415
I lost my dad too.

247
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,584
Carlos's connection to Cuba

248
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:33,297
was a bond that neither time
nor distance could ever break.

249
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,841
Unbreakable bonds.

250
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,261
That's what we got.
Family takes care of family, right?

251
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,932
See, you get it. Wait! I got a great idea.

252
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,602
You should come live with me in Florida.

253
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,522
Yeah, we're going home tomorrow.
Come on, get in the bag.

254
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,194
Wait, wait, Vivo. Where are you going?

255
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,738
Are you worried about
where you'll be going to the bathroom?

256
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,365
It's okay. I got wipes in here.

257
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,909
So I thank you so much

258
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,494
for receiving Gabriela and I
with open arms.

259
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,288
<i>Gracias, señora</i>.

Gabi, what are you doing?

302
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,989
Just playing a tune.

303
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,867
Maybe Vivo will hear it,
and I can take him back to Florida.

304
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,828
Oh, that's right. She's from Florida.

305
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,497
Gabriela, what did I say? No more pets.

306

- Please?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,294
And besides, we cannot take
a wild animal on a plane.

308
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,212
Ugh.

309
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,172
<i>Señora</i> Hernández!

310
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,426
So glad I caught you before you left.

311
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,345
Gabi, <i>mi niña,</i>

312
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,516
we know you love music,
just like your Uncle Andrés.

313
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,229
So, we wanted to see you off
with a few of his musical mementos.

314
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,731
Vintage maracas! Claves!

315
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,986
Ho ho! Check out this bad boy!

316
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:10,615
Oh, thank you, Montoya.
You gave my kid an accordion.

317
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,033
You feeling it, Mom?

318
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,578
Ah, what a beautiful thing.

319
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,538
Music is in her blood.

320
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,500
- Cuba! Cuba! I love Cuban music.
- Oh!

321
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,421
That's it. Marta, here I come.

322
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,132
What's up, Cuba?
I'll give you a backbeat.

323
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,760
Thank you. Thank you, Gabi.

324
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,388
I'm sure all of Cuba knows you're here.

325
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,892
Sorry. Guess my playing
was a little too hardcore.

326
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,019
Playing? That noise was playing?

327
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,690
Ah, <i>bueno</i>. Here's your taxi.

328
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,233
Montoya, thank you.

329
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,068
<i>¡Gracias, Montoya!</i>

330
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,863
<i>Adiós.</i> Practice that music every day.

331
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,514
Ugh, my head.

332
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,183
I guess traveling is not my thing.

333
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,689
Where am I? What time is it?
What time is it? What time is it?

334
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,360
Okay, 10 a.m. Still have ten hours.

335
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,573
Oh, right. It's the backpack kid.

336
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,660
Look what I got. Hmm? Hmm?

337
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:40,747
- Are you excited about today?
- Oh, yeah, of course. What's today?

338
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,000
It's your first cookie sale
with the Sand Dollar Troop.

339
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:44,960
Woot woot!

340
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,212
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen.

341
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,507
I've taken the Sand Dollars
about as far as I can.

342
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,885
Gabi, what are you talking about?
You've only been to one meeting.

343
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,303
I know.

344
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,889
- But it's time to move on.
- Move on?

345
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,601
You just started with the troop.
You're still getting to know them.

346
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,937
Ha! Tail never fails.

347
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,108
Please, give them a chance.

348
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,235
Look, I made my resignation video.

349
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,654
<i>Cookies!</i>

350
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,240
<i>Peace. We out. Bye.</i>

351
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,786
- Creative.
- Wait, wait, wait!

352
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,873
This is the best part.
I turned them into zombie clowns.

353
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,626
<i>Buy my cookies.</i>

354
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,838
Gabriela Maria Rosa Hernández,
you are a part of that troop.

355
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,632
They're counting on you.
You can't just abandon them.

356
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,883
Why?

357
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,971
<i>Pulgita,</i> you can't keep pushing
everyone away.

358
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,350
If you don't at least try
to get along with other kids,

359
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,436
you're going to be very lonely.

360
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,854
Meh.

361
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,691
Gabriela, <i>escúchame. </i>You're doing this!

362
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,277
I let you keep
that... that... that... that purple hair.

363
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,194
You owe me one!

364
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,948
But, Mom, all they ever talk about
are selling cookies,

365
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,701
getting badges, saving the Everglades.

366
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,995
It's so boring!

367
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,832
You're going to the cookie sale.
You're going to take selfies.

368
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,627
And you're going to have fun and bond!

369
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,546
Now put on the uniform. It's really cute.

370
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,973
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

371
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,895
Coast is clear. Let's get out of here.

372
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:42,827
Ow! Ow! Whoa! Ow!

373
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,748
Ow! Ow!

374
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:53,963
It's fine. It's just the belongings
of your dearly departed great uncle.

375
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,424
Rolling on the floor, all by itself.

376
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,761
Playing spooky accordion music.

377
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,564
It's fine.

378
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,341
- Vivo, you're here!
- Yup. And now I'm leaving.

379
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,470
You followed me, didn't you?

380
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,264
And you snuck in my bag

381
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,391
because you love me!

382
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,436
I'm so glad you're here, Vivo.

383
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,522
Now I have someone
to share my friendship bracelet with.

384
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,399
Best friends forever!

385
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,110
- Hey, let go. Paws to yourself.
- Hold still.

386
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,239
- Forever's a long time, kid!
- I have a song to deliver.

387
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,200
Nice meeting you. Peace!

388
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,667
Are those little gravestones?

389
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,085
Oh, that's my petting zoo.

390
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,421
Well, it was.

391
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,173
Gabi?

392
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,466
It's my Mom. Hide.

393
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,471
'Sup, Mom?

394
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,265
Why did I just find this in the microwave?

395
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,101
I was drying it?

396
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,645
You were dr... What is that?

397
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,859
How many times have I told you?
No food in the room.

398
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,819
We're going to attract animals.

399
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,030
Here, take your uniform.

400
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,574
You mean my invisibility cloak?

401
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,619
- Gabi.
- I can feel hives coming on.

402
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,871
My throat is getting itchy.

403
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,998
It's a uniform, not an allergy.

404
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,541
Here. Hurry up and change.

405
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,305
We don't wanna be late
for the cookie sale.

406
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,003
Yes, I do.

407
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,298
Did you see that, Vivo?

408
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,718
She doesn't get me at all.

409
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,845
She wants me to wear a uniform

410
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,514
just like everyone else.

411
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,683
But I'm not like everyone else, because...

Phew!
That girl is a whole lot of something.

466
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,165
So, this is Florida?

467
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,337
Huh.

468
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,507
Oh. Plastic birds.

469
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,717
Florida's weird.

470
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,097
Now all I have to do is find Marta.

471
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,141
Come on, Andrés.
I need some kind of a sign.

472
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,145
Anything. Point the way. Any sign will do.

473
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,279
Mambo Cabana.

474
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,239
Excuse me.

475
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,409
- Is this the bus to Miami?
- Yes, sir, it is.

476
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,203
Perfect. Mambo Cabana, here I come.

480
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,005
It's a ferret!

481
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,091
Hey! No pets,
no critters, whatever you are.

482
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,843
Get off of my bus.

483
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,428
Not on my watch.

484
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,224
Oh, you like that?
I came up with that myself.

485
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,563
Aw, you are adorable.

486
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,606
Uh, thank you?

487
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,150
Probably tasty too.

488
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,363
No! Get away!

489
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,839
- There you are!
- No, no, no, no, no!

490
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,468
I know why you came to Florida.
You're trying to find Marta.

491
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,012
I read Marta's letter.

492
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,600
<i>Tío</i> Andrés wanted to be
at her show tonight, didn't he?

493
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,730
Are you trying to get there too?

494
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,649
But... but why?

495
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,866
What's this?

496
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,369
"Para Marta"?

497
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,663
<i>Tío</i> wrote her a song?

498
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:47,710
"Your plane leaves in the morning.
Soon the world will see you shine."

499
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:52,924
"And I wish I could go with you,
but your journey isn't mine."

500
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,594
You know what this means?

501
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,846
He never got to say,

502
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,681
"I love you."

503
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,856
Vivo, this is really important.
Marta needs to hear this song.

504
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,817
And I'm gonna get you there.

505
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,944
You are?

506
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,988
Marta's final show

507
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,991
is at the Mambo Cabana in Miami.

508
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,994
We don't have much time.
But don't worry. I have a plan.

509
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,664
First, get in my bag.

510
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,416
Ugh!

511
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,337
Anything for Andrés.
Anything for Andrés. Anything for Andrés.

512
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,384
But it's Marta Sandoval's last show ever!

513
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,635
- Come on, Mom,
- What?

514
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,262
Miami isn't that far.

515
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,973
Since when
are you such a Marta Sandoval fan?

516
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,226
Since I was born. I'm a huge fan.

517
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,353
Name one song.

518
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:51,023
Uh, <i>"</i>Despacito<i>"</i>?

519
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,319
Get ready for the cookie sale.
I'm not going to tell you again.

520
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,867
Don't worry, I have another better idea.

521
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,453
Does it involve cleaning your backpack?
'Cause there's a lot of stuff in there.

522
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,956
Wipes are none of them. I saw no wipes.

523
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,374
Let's see.

524
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,793
Key West to Miami.

525
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,214
Perfect. This will get us there
in time for the show.

526
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,427
Mambo Cabana, here we come.

One can hope.

Welcome
to beautiful downtown Key West.

541
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,931
and if anyone asks,
you're my emotional support animal.

542
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,349
Cookies!

543
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,017
Cookie sale.

544
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,604
All proceeds
go to protecting endangered species.

545
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,564
Oh no, the Sand Dollars.

546
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,318
Oh, Mr. Henshaw. Can I interest you
in some Manatee Minties?

547
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,863
Did you know the Everglades are home
to 2,000 species of plants and animals?

548
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,865
And 70 of those are endanger...

549
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:27,078
Oh, excuse me. You know
that if you buy a Sand Dollars cloth bag

550
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,080
instead of using a plastic one,

551
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,791
then you won't have the blood
of Mother Nature on your hands.

552
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,709
I'm not a bad man.

553
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,836
I just want a cookie.

554
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,469
We gotta get out of here
before they see us.

555
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,762
Hernández!

556
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,932
Oh, hello, blonde one.

557
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,642
Other girls.

558
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,102
Gabi, where's your uniform?

559
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,146
Yes, we have rules, Hernández.

560
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,484
Only a Sand Dollar in full uniform
may participate in a cookie sale.

561
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,777
What?

562
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,656
The cookie sale is today?
I totally thought that was yesterday.

563
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,866
But you didn't show up
yesterday either, did ya?

564
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,326
That's a good point.

565
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,621
I was busy rescuing this animal.

566
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,790
Aw!

567
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,501
- What are you doing?
- Oh, he's so cute.

568
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,627
Can I pet him?

569
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,879
- No.
- Go to town. He loves it.

570
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,172
- Look at that face.
- Aw!

571
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,259
- He's adorable.
- Hey! Stop. This is borderline abuse.

572
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,469
- His little ears! Oh!
- So fuzzy. What's his name?

573
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:29,056
His name's Vivo. And he's a possum.

574
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,726
Gabi, that's not a possum.

575
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,185
That's a kinkajou.

576
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,896
A very rare South American
tropical rain forest mammal,

577
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,231
aka the honey bear.

578
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,275
The honey bear?
Never heard it, but I'll take it.

579
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,694
His eyes look a little cloudy.

580
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,946
His coat is kinda mangy.

581
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,990
Has he seen a veterinarian?

582
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,408
Uh, sorry, what?

583
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,119
Gabi, there are rules
to be followed.

584
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,123
For his own safety, he needs vaccinations
and a week of medical observation.

585
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,750
A week?

586
00:38:55,833 --> 00:39:00,755
Yes. Isolated from other animals.
Didn't you read your Sand Dollars manual?

587
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,467
Oh, yeah, the week. We did that.

588
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,971
Oh, good. Then you wouldn't mind
showing me his vaccination certificate?

589
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,640
Yeah, I'll get it right now.

590
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,976
It's in the trunk of my bike.

591
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,729
No, no, no, no.

592
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,689
- Uh-oh.
- Time for plan B.

593
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,984
Wait a minute.
Bikes don't have a trunk, right?

594
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,154
You know, I'm starting to think
she doesn't have a certificate.

595
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,156
Yeah, you think?

596
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,618
Girls, we've got us
a Sand Dollar gone rogue.

597
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,495
Move out!

598
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,583
Change of plans.
We'll catch the bus at the next stop.

599
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,921
- Pull over, Hernández!
- Oh no.

600
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,255
Surrender the kinkajou!

601
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,174
Don't worry, Vivo. I'll lose them.

602
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,468
But what about the bus?
The plan was the bus.

603
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,182
Well, that didn't work.

604
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,810
Come on, Vivo.
Get back there and shake 'em off.

605
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,689
Ha! Take that. How fun is this?

606
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,819
And this should not be
in a child's backpack, but here you go!

607
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,780
Hey! Oh, no, you didn't.

608
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,615
Oh, there's the wipes. Ha!

609
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,243
Stop! You stop right there,
you little... Ah!

610
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,244
Huh.

611
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,747
Haha! Take that.

612
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,961
He's dousing himself with chemicals!

613
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:25,714
It's a cry for help.
Gabi, give us the kinkajou!

614
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,883
Ah!

615
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,009
Mr. Henshaw!

616
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,469
You drove here?

617
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,388
You live two blocks away!

618
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,556
Shame on you!

619
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,766
Shame.

620
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,024
You're in over your head, Hernández.
Give him up!

621
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,787
Vivo, hold on tight.

622
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,873
- We're gonna jump it!
- What?

623
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,376
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

624
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,880
All right, Miami, here we come.

625
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,175
- Ah!
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

626
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,304
Huh.

627
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:27,568
What have we done? We've allowed
that poor, defenseless creature

628
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,238
to roam free in a world
where he surely won't survive.

629
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,826
- So, back to the cookie booth?
- Cookie booth? Uh, no!

630
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,954
It's our duty
as Sand Dollars to rescue him.

631
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,038
Eva!

632
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,832
Yeah?

633
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,876
We're gonna need your dad's boat.

634
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:52,009
The song. Where is it? Where is it?
Where is... where is... where is...

635
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,474
Ah. Still in one piece.

636
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,727
Okay, where are we? Where is that bus?

637
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,857
No!

638
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,736
Whee!

639
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,697
Sand angels!

640
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,741
Vivo, you should really try this.

641
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,412
Look at me. I'm a cat. Meow, meow.

642
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,581
Ugh. I gotta get off this boat.

643
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,749
Hey, Vivo.

644
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,378
I know we missed the bus,
but don't worry, I have a plan C.

645
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,256
If we take a shortcut
through the Everglades National Park,

646
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,799
we can make it before the show.

647
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,719
Okay. New plan. Let's see.

648
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,390
Hmm.

649
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,226
Ha!

650
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,150
Ha!

651
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,278
Whoa, Vivo, we're so in sync.

652
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,822
Just like a mind meld.

653
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,040
Oh man. I thought it could hold it.

654
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,629
Mind meld? If we had a mind meld,
you'd be panicking,

655
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,048
because that was our ticket to Miami.

656
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,594
Now we're stuck on this giant boat
headed in the wrong direction.

657
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,598
We couldn't be more out of sync.
This is what "in sync" sounds like.

658
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,645
This is you and me.

659
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,487
We have totally different definitions
of the word "plan."

660
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:39,033
To me and other rational people,
a plan revolves around the Five P's.

661
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,993
Proper Planning
Prevents Poor Performance.

662
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,244
But you,

663
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:46,206
your plans are just bad impulses.

664
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,000
What are you doing?

665
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:52,755
Ta-da! Sometimes you gotta improvise.

666
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,757
Yeah, that will never float.

667
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,139
And the journey begins now!

668
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,352
It floats. It actually floats.

669
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,686
- Oh!
- Heads up.

670
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,483
Give me a sec.
Don't want to pull a hammy.

671
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,902
Okay. Ready, Vivo?

672
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,571
Woo-hoo!

673
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,908
And she missed.

674
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,791
I missed the boat completely.

675
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,127
Did you see that, Vivo?

676
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,588
Hysterical.

677
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,638

No!

757
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,965
The song!

758
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,595

- No, no, no. I got it.

759
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,098
Vivo! Ah! I can't see.

No, no, no, no

Yes!

- No!

00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,853
Gabriela Maria,
pick up your phone right now!

775
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,938
I saw the bus schedule on your computer.

776
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,065
If you think you're in trouble now,

777
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,776
ooh, it's about to get worse.

778
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,702
I am right next to the bus, honking.
This is me.

779
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,830
I know you can hear me.

780
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,709
Pull over!

781
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,711
- Huh? What the...
- Aah!

782
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:51,339
Uh, you're not gonna
let her pass us, are you?

783
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,966
Not on my watch.

784
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,472
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't you drive away from me.

785
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,976
Gabi!

786
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,103
<i>Gabi!</i>

787
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,355
Gabi!

788
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,357
Gabi!

789
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,196
She's not responding.
I gotta start searching this swamp.

790
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,824
Birds. Bird's-eye view, perfect.

791
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,244
Hey, you guys!
I need your help spotting somebody...

792
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,087
Ugh.

793
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,756
Oh, good. A bird.

794
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,718
Excuse me. Uh, I'm Vivo.
I got separated from my friend.

795
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,595
Purple hair, necktie. Ah!

796
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,973
Ah. Could you maybe fly me up
and help me spot her?

797
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,350
Normally, I'd help a guy out,

798
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:47,354
but...I'm gettin' ready
to take the long dirt nap.

799
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,314
What? No, no, no, no, no, no!

800
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,067
Don't talk like that!
I'm sure you have a lot to live for.

801
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,779
It's not like that.
Actually, I'm taking a literal nap.

802
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,906
Yeah, I'm just hibernating

803
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,991
until the end of my life.

804
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,911
I mean, the end of dating season.

805
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,163
Dating. Sounds horrible. As I was saying...

806
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,415
You don't understand, Vivo.
All my life I've been told,

807
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,126
"Don't worry, Dancarino."

808
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,210
"One dating season,

809
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,173
you're gonna find the girl of your dreams,
and love's gonna pick you up."

810
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,494
That's great. But I got a thing. Huh?

811
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:23,515
<i>♪ Love's gonna pick you up
And never put you down ♪</i>

812
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,938
- Yeah. We all know the tune.
- Wanna cool it with all that love?

813
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,274
Um, so, I'm kind of
in a bit of a time crunch.

814
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:35,902
I've been here for eight,
count them, eight straight seasons,

815
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,989
and instead of love picking me up,
it's just dumped me in a ditch.

816
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,157
Tragic. Anyway...

817
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,451
I'm an invisible spoonbill.
No one cares I'm alive.

818
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,246
Especially Valentina.

819
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,129
- Valentina's looking at me, isn't she?
- Yeah.

820
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,892
Nobody knows I know you.
You don't know me.

821
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,467
- Good luck finding your friend. Bye!
- Ah! Wait. Get out of there.

822
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:03,221
- Have you tried telling her how you feel?
- No! I can't tell her.

823
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,305
I'm scared.

824
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,727
No, I've heard this song before.
It doesn't end well.

825
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,439
Come on, I'll coach you through it.
Then you'll help me find my friend. Deal?

826
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,900
Okay, deal.

827
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,528
Now, introduce yourself.

828
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,031
Hi, you're Dancarino.

829
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,283
I mean, I'm... I'm Dancarino.

830
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,870
Hmm. Enchanted.

831
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,998
- No. Back to my hole.
- No, no, no. Hey, hey, focus.

832
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,459
Smile and compliment her.

833
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,128
- Uh, Valentina.
- You got this.

834
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:39,049
Your eyes are like two huge pools...

835
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:43,595
No, they're like
two big bayous in your face.

836
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,431
Bayous? In my face?

837
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,433
Oh no.

838
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:52,354
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said about my...

839
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,653
Got a frog in my throat.

840
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,865
Sorry, Gary.

841
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:12,374
- Oh, they're perfect for each other.
- Oh, Dancarino.

842
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:15,210
You have such handsome plumage.

843
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:18,880
- It's nice for my eye...
- uh, bayous...to look at.

844
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:22,008
'Cause they're actually my eyes.

845
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,345
This is going strangely well.

846
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,306
Now, take her hand.

847
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,226
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry. Oh!

848
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,144
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

849
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,021
I have another eye. It's totally great.

850
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,107
- Ow!
- Oh! Easy with the beak.

851
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,068
Not too quick, Dan.
Uh, yeah. Go in at an angle.

852
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,361
To the left. Yes.

853
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,988
That's it.

854
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,198
Now, fly away together.

855
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:52,998
<i>♪ Love's gonna pick you up
And never put you down ♪</i>

856
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,623
Perfect.

857
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,671
What? Wait, you were supposed to help me.

858
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:00,630
Come back!

859
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,132
We had a deal.

860
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,343
We had a deal!

861
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,560
Okay, <i>vamos. </i>Heads up, everyone.

862
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,186
Showtime's in four hours.

863
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,939
We need to get
the lighting cues down for the finale.

864
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,818
Excuse me, <i>mi niña</i>. Any word from Andrés?

865
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,738
Not yet, <i>señora</i>.
I'll double-check right away.

866
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:25,821
Thank you.

867
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,744
Where are you, my friend?

868
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,175
Vivo?

869
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,346
Vivo? Where are you?

870
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:53,600
Oh no, where is it?
Where is it? Where's the song?

871
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,437
Come on. Vivo's gonna kill me.

872
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,567
Oh. Whoa!

873
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,115
Ooh. It's just a turtle.

874
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,159
It's not <i>just </i>a turtle.

875
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,371
Becky?

876
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,456
It's a Florida red-bellied cooter.

877
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,750
It belongs here.
It's native to these parts.

878
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,169
Unlike your friend. Where is he?

879
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,880
Um, he's kinda missing.

880
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,885
You lost a kinkajou in the Everglades?

881
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,180
Well, congratulations, Hernández.
You've killed him.

882
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,306
Wait, what?

883
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,142
A kinkajou
cannot survive in this environment.

884
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,604
His natural predator
is every animal in here.

885
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:43,316
He needs to be quarantined.
And you are gonna help us find him.

886
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,777
Heh. I'm not helping you.

887
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,197
Then I guess you don't want this.

888
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,282
You were looking for this song,
weren't you?

889
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,910
No, I don't care about that song.

890
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:57,038
Fine. Then we should recycle it. Eva?

891
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,832
Huh?

892
00:56:58,915 --> 00:56:59,915
Eat it.

893
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,584
Yeah, all right.

894
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,178
Wait!

895
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,847
Fine, you win.

896
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,559
I'll wear the uniform. I'll sell cookies.
I will do whatever you want.

897
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,602
Just give me the song back.

898
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,979
You get the song

899
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,982
when the kinkajou
is safely in our custody.

900
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,067
Gabi!

901
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,027
Where are you, Gabi?

902
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,782
Disgusting! Who am I kidding?

903
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,952
I'm not cut out for this. I'll be lucky
to get out of this swamp alive.

904
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,620
- Gabi!
- Shh.

905
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,874
Did you just shush me?

906
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,543
Buddy, be quiet.

907
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,796
Seriously?
Do you have any idea what I've bee...

908
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,465
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

909
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,886
Are you bup-bup-bup-bup-
bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-ing me?

910
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,263
That's it. You want me to be quiet?

911
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,849
I'm being quiet!

912
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,727
Yeah. I thought so. Walk away, buddy.

913
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,522
We're in the middle of a swamp.
Who cares about a little noise?

914
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,026
Me.

915
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,990
Mmm, what a lovely voice you have.

916
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,367
Never seen you around these parts.

917
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,579
My name's Lutador. You got a name?

918
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,789
It's Vivo.

919
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,709
Oh! My goodness, I hate that name.

920
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,837
Your new name is Noisy.

921
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,673
Noisy the Singing Rat.

922
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,300
Yeah.

923
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,968
I'm not a rat.

924
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,179
What... what are you? A gibbon?

925
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,056
I'm a kinkajou.

926
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:42,143
Mmm. Sounds exotic. Hoo.

927
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,230
Well, you listen right here,
little kinkajou.

928
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,983
I hate noise.

929
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,110
So you must be quiet.

930
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,780
That's my rule, man.

931
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:58,284
And everyone around these parts
understands it. Don't y'all?

932
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,923
Mmm. That's what I like to hear.

933
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:15,468
Absolutely nothing.

934
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,179
Uh, I'm sorry. I promise,
you won't hear a peep from me.

935
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,598
You want quiet?
I can do quiet. I'll be quiet.

936
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:24,018
I know very well you're gonna be quiet.

937
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,896
Deathly silent, in fact.

938
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,982
All my meals are.

939
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,065

00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,363
Ho ho ho ho! Would you look at that?

941
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,407
Oh, my friend...

942
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,077
...you're about to run out of tree.

943
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,341
Huh?

944
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,178
Oh, thank goodness. I'm saved.

945
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,555

Vivo, stay there.
The Sand Dollars are right behind me.

01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:00,842
They have the song.
But don't worry, I have a plan.

Oh no, he's gonna kill us!

1000

That's right. And noisier than ever.
Bop bop bop bop!

1009
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,443
Stop making the noise.

1010
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,694
Yeah? Come make me.

1012
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:49,325
Excuse me, ladies. I'll be right back.

1013
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,953
Vivo, what are you doing?

1014
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,413
I don't know.
But sometimes you gotta improvise.

1015
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,714
- You got this, Vivo.
- Gabi.

1016

That's it. Okay.
Enough is enough.

1024
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,996
- Huh.
- You can't run forever!

Gabi, are... are you okay?

1039
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,243
You totally took down that snake!

1040
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,496
- You are one crazy kinkajou.
- He's a hero.

1041
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,290
A fuzzy hero.

1042
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,667
I was wrong about you, Vivo.

1043
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,512
I mean, I still think
you really should be quarantined

1044
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:25,630
for ten days,

1045
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:30,134
but you did save us from an apex predator.

1046
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:33,304
So, I'm gonna let this one slide.

Yeah, we're cool.

Can we have the song back?

1050
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,272
Of course, the song.

01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,150

Make my way back to Cuba, I guess.

1068
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:42,975
Without the song,
there's nothing left. I failed.

You did all you could do.

Dan, you don't understand.
Andrés gave me everything.

And when he needed me, I turned my back.

1072
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,530
This was my one chance
to make things right.

1073

that people find pleasing to the ear.

1085
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:47,748
Those who know music call it a melody.

1086
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,418
Vivo, you know the melody.

1087
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,921
Of course I do!
It's the foundation of music!

1088
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,381
And while you may know the lyrics,

1089
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,217
you have to learn the melody
in order to sing, because...

1090
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:02,221
Wait. You know the lyrics.
And I know the melody!

1091
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,348
Hey, you guys, Vivo knows the melody!

1092
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,267
- She knows the lyrics.
- This means...

1093
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,893
We've still got the song!

1094
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,062
The mission for love is back on!

1095
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,274
Turn the boat around.
We're going to Miami!

1096
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:14,567
What?

1097
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:19,572
You heard the kinkajou.
Turn the boat around.

1098
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,624
Huh. We got a second chance.

1099
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,002
Here, Vivo. Check this out.

1100
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,178
You play the keyboard,
and I'll write down the notes.

1101
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,440
"Your plane leaves in the morning."

1102
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,734
"Soon the world will see you shine."

1103
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:15,419
Yeah, can you play that,
like, a hundred times slower?

you have to finish the mission.

01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,751

1172

All right, partner.

1173
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:37,806
We got her.

1174
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,895
Hi, Mom.

1175
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:47,649
I understand,
but Marta is taking this really hard.

1176
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,401
Yes, she says she can't go on.

1177
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,404
Look, I'll check back in five minutes.

1178

1179
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:07,627
Hmm.

1180
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:20,766
Andrés.

1181
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,239
Are you Vivo?

1182
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,786
You came all the way from Cuba?

1183
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:43,121
What are you doing here?

1184
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,047
"Para Marta."

1185
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,134
Andrés wrote this.

1186
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,178
For me?

1187
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,480
Thank you.

1188
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,651
He never told me he felt this way.

1189
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:16,905
I love you too, Andrés.

1190
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,244
Oh, Vivo, thank you.

1191
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,556
<i>Señora</i>?

1192
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,373
We're ready whenever you are.

1193
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,792
I have to go.

1194
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:35,132
And here I thought this concert
was about saying goodbye to the old songs,

1195
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:38,552
but now, I have a new song to sing.

1196
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,557
You know, Vivo,

1197
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:46,393
Andrés would be so proud of you.

1198
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:47,603
Mwah.

1199
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,936
But, Mom, Vivo needed to deliver
a love song to Marta.

1200
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:33,065
Do you hear yourself?
Gabriela, this is crazy!

1201
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,526
You see? This is why I didn't tell you.
I knew you wouldn't get it.

1202
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,862
Oh, ho ho ho ho, I get you all right.

1203
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:41,156
No. No, you don't.

1204
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:42,699
Not like Dad did.

1205
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,118
No, no, no.
You're not doing that, Gabriela.

1206
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,995
He's not here. I'm here.

1207
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,915
And I know, I know I'm not your father.

1208
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:52,626
I know I'm not funny,
and I don't do music.

1209
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:55,462
But you can talk to me.

1210
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:58,256
You don't even understand
why this is important to me.

1211
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,052
Only Vivo does.

1212
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:03,553
Vivo is in Cuba.

1213
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:07,848
Vivo!

1214
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,821
Did you get the song to Marta?

1215
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:23,656
You did it.

1216
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,203
That's right. <i>We </i>did it.

1217
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,374
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1218
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,793
You were telling me the truth?

1219
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:37,838
Oh, Gabi.

1220
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,131
But still,

1221
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:44,094
you can't just go a hundred miles
to Miami without telling me.

1222
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:46,763
I know. I'm sorry, okay?

1223
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:50,434
But I j... I just had to deliver <i>tío's</i> song.

1224
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:54,896
He... he didn't get to tell
Marta he loved her.

1225
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:57,898
Just like

1226
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:01,153
I never got to tell Dad how...

1227
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:03,613
how much I loved him.

1228
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:26,178
Your dad knew you loved him
every moment from when he first met you.

1229
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:27,929
And that love, Gabriela,

1230
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:31,558
that love lives forever in your heart.

1231

Welcome to the family, Vivo.

1232
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:46,448
