00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,700
<i>The political situation in the world</i>

3
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:29,997
<i>is such as to cause
grave concern and anxiety.</i>

4
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:32,891
<i>It has now reached a stage</i>

5
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:35,658
<i>where the very foundations
of civilization</i>

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,791
<i>are seriously threatened.</i>

7
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:40,591
<i>War is a contagion.</i>

8
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:42,119
<i>The peace of the world,</i>

9
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:45,080
<i>the welfare and security
of every nation,</i>

10
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:46,399
<i>including our own,</i>

11
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:49,224
<i>is being threatened
by that very thing.</i>

12
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:54,206
<i>Let no one imagine
that America will escape.</i>

13
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,358
<i>Yes, we are determined
to keep out of war.</i>

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,925
<i>Yet, we cannot
insure ourselves</i>

15
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,691
<i>against the disastrous effects
of war,</i>

16
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:06,126
<i>and the dangers
of involvement.</i>

17
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:20,226
This is bloody ridiculous.

18
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:22,793
Wasn't your empire built
on ridiculous traditions?

19
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:24,526
Don't defend them, Layton.

20
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:26,493
You might speak
their language,

21
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:28,393
but they still think
you're a barbarian.

22
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:29,860
Be honest.

23
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:31,862
You won't miss this place
when you're gone?

24
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:34,627
Oh, please.

25
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,627
The next time
I see the little buggers,

26
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:39,595
I hope it's through the sights
of a 14-inch gun.

27
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,576
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

28
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:50,476
On behalf
of the British Empire,

29
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:53,178
I wish to thank
Admiral Yamamoto

30
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,444
for this invitation.

31
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:59,613
May our nations work together
to maintain peace on the seas.

32
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:35,526
Which is why I know

33
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,993
that you must
have an opinion.

34
00:03:37,995 --> 00:03:41,294
I was once our naval attache
in Washington.

35
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,492
After you went to Harvard.

36
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:46,459
Like you,
I thought there was value

37
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:49,626
in studying
a potential adversary.

38
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:51,526
There's a rumor that you
told the prime minister

39
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:53,959
that Japan can't win a war
with the United States.

40
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:57,592
I said we couldn't win
a long war.

41
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:00,361
There's another rumor
that your life is in danger.

42
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:03,926
That the nationalists
think you're too moderate

43
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:05,494
and have targeted you
for assassination.

44
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:19,328
Japan is at a crossroads.

45
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:23,460
We are emboldened
by our invasion of China

46
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:26,894
and eager to become
a world power.

47
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,562
Yet we get 80% of our oil
from your country.

48
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:35,860
If that supply is threatened,

49
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:38,662
it will force us
into drastic measures.

50
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:42,794
You want me to pass
this information

51
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,460
along to Washington?

52
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:47,527
Don't push us into a corner.

53
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,760
You must give those of us
who are more reasonable

54
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:53,562
a chance to carry the day.

55
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,829
Nobody wants a war.

56
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:05,895
<i>Sayonara.</i>

57
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:09,396
<i>Sayonara.</i>

58
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:19,898
Come on.
Step it up, ladies!

59
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,595
Clear the flight deck.

60
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:23,898
Let's go.

61
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,498
Prepare to brace!

62
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,830
Why aren't you
using the flaps, sir?

63
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:43,496
Because someday
we might have to land

64
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:45,130
with our flaps shot away.

65
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:47,498
So we might as well
practice now.

66
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,696
This isn't how Ensign Hunt
used to fly.

67
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:55,963
Which is why Ensign Hunt
is now counting seagulls

68
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:57,363
in San Diego

69
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:58,365
and you're here with me.

70
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:01,698
Looks like we got hit
in our fuel tank, too.

71
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:03,897
Please don't, sir.

72
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,463
This might save your life
one day, Murray.

73
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:07,498
Engine's about to die.

74
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,630
<i>Stand by to recover aircraft.</i>

75
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:15,930
What the hell
is Best doing?

76
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:17,363
He's out of the groove.

77
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:19,097
It looks like
his engine cut out.

78
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,530
Is it a stunt,
or is he in trouble?

79
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:22,931
I don't know.

80
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,430
But he's going to hit
the first wire like always.

81
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:26,533
Not with that angle.

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,597
Why are we sideways?

83
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,731
To shave speed

84
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,998
so we don't put a hole
in the deck.

85
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,866
Better not crash
that damn plane.

86
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,031
Hey, hang in there, kid.

87
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:41,033
We're almost home.

88
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:50,499
Brace!

89
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,498
Are you trying
to get court marshalled?

90
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,834
I had electrical issue.

91
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,099
Could have happened to anyone.

92
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,431
Hey!

93
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,001
Good job.

94
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:29,665
Well, it's not me
you have to convince.

95
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,765
McClusky's about ready
to have your ass.

96
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:33,765
Then I'll take it upstairs
to the old man.

97
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:35,065
He knows what's coming.

98
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:35,932
That's why we've been flying

99
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,932
double scouting missions
this whole trip.

100
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,598
Going somewhere?

101
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,932
Yeah, they're sending
the whole squadron

102
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,099
into Pearl this morning.

103
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:56,799
And I'll be drinking a beer
on the beach with Roy by noon.

104
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:58,099
And I'm not coming?

105
00:08:58,101 --> 00:09:00,733
No. McClusky's holding back
Scouting Six.

106
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,301
It's probably 'cause
you're such an asshole.

107
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:06,533
Yeah, you're lovin' this,
right?

108
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:08,633
Morning, sir.
Aircraft is spotted.

109
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,633
Hey, take it easy on Miller.

110
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,533
He's having a tough morning.

111
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,566
It's my last day
of sea duty, sir.

112
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:16,900
And I'm the only one from my
radio class who hasn't crashed.

113
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:18,666
Don't worry, Miller.

114
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:20,633
I'm sure even
Mr. Dickinson can fly you

115
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,399
from here to Pearl
without getting you wet.

116
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:25,066
Hey. Me and Roy,

117
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:27,468
we'll pour a little beer
out on the beach for ya.

118
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:50,734
Well, you boys
are taking your sweet time.

119
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:53,101
Chaplain's gonna
be here any minute.

120
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:55,134
It's another hot one, sir.

121
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,901
- Are you complaining, Sully?
- No, sir.

122
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:58,967
I just can't help wondering

123
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,934
why I have to set up
chairs for church,

124
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:04,034
even though
I don't believe in God.

125
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,903
Well, that's because your
only religion is chasing tail.

126
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:10,801
And the Navy ain't gonna
pay you for that.

127
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:26,836
Incoming!

128
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:50,637
Barbara!

129
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:52,670
Barbara!

130
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,870
Barbara, come here!

131
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,635
Come on, sweetheart.

132
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,468
Get the wounded below deck!

133
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,970
Everyone else,
battle stations!

134
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:33,504
Get down!

135
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:43,036
Comin' to church?

136
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,704
I have to go
to the office.

137
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:46,638
It's Sunday.

138
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,402
You work too hard.

139
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:00,736
Layton residence.

140
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:05,402
I'll meet you outside.

141
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:06,903
Edwin, what's happening?

142
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:08,504
The Japanese are attacking us.

143
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,503
Did you reach the office?

144
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,703
No. The switchboard
was jammed.

145
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:15,839
Go.

146
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:28,338
Sully, get up!
Come on!

147
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:31,403
We need to get
to the gun directors.

148
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:33,006
They're firing way too low.

149
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:41,539
Take cover! Get down!

150
00:12:57,605 --> 00:12:58,873
Drive!

151
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,404
Hey. Hey.

152
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:05,339
Are you okay?

153
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:25,638
We have to get off
the ship. Come on.

154
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Hurry up, kid.

155
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:30,871
We gotta jump.

156
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:32,073
You go in that water,
you're dead.

157
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:38,905
Sully! You first, Sully!

158
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:40,771
I can't! My hands...

159
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:42,105
You wanna live?

160
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:44,640
You get to that goddamned
ship, you hear me?

161
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,672
What is it, sir?

162
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:00,605
Looks like Coastal Artillery
went stark mad.

163
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,407
I bet you somebody's gonna
catch hell for it.

164
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:06,541
Incoming!

165
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:13,072
Miller, break radio silence.
Get that gun working!

166
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:15,074
Pearl is under attack.
This is no shit.

167
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,307
Miller, you okay?

168
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,441
Miller, bail out!

169
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,640
Miller! Miller!

170
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,009
Miller!

171
00:14:51,842 --> 00:14:53,473
What the hell
is going on?

172
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,073
Pearl is shooting at our guys,
sir.

173
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,573
Then maybe it isn't Pearl.

174
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:57,773
Look, call Dickinson.

175
00:14:57,775 --> 00:14:59,506
We had a transmission
that he was under attack

176
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:00,575
and then nothing.

177
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:04,508
Sir.

178
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,009
Get this to the admiral.

179
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:25,543
Keep going, Sully.

180
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,576
Get down!

181
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:50,943
Oh, come on.

182
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:56,374
There's the man
who tried to warn us.

183
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:59,108
If it's any satisfaction to
you, Layton, you were right.

184
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,707
Sir, it's no satisfaction
to me whatsoever.

185
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:15,877
You bastard.

186
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:47,642
Sir, where are they going?

187
00:16:47,644 --> 00:16:48,809
Back to their carriers.

188
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:50,642
Drive out
to the radio direction finder

189
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:51,775
and report back to me.

190
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:52,877
Yes, sir.

191
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:01,545
<i>Admiral Halsey on deck.</i>

192
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:04,976
Pearl found something?

193
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:06,976
Intelligence managed
to get a line of bearing

194
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:08,078
on the attacking fleet.

195
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,676
But it's a bilateral reading.

196
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:15,409
The Japanese are
either at 343 degrees

197
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,110
or 163 degrees.

198
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,843
Oh, for Christ's sake.

199
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,743
Pearl is under attack
and we don't even know

200
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:22,543
if the bastards
are north or south?

201
00:17:22,545 --> 00:17:25,812
Army bombers also reported
a possible ship sighting here.

202
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:28,978
We're gonna place our bet

203
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,576
right there.

204
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:34,743
We have a possible
location on the Jap fleet.

205
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,743
Fly a grid on bearing 185.

206
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:37,743
If you make contact,

207
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:39,709
Best and his men
will put down a smokescreen

208
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:42,376
and then the torpedo bombers
will make their runs.

209
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:43,810
Lindsey has command.

210
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,911
Eh, to hell with smoke.

211
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:48,410
Let me go after those carriers
with a real bomb.

212
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:50,144
Torpedoes sink ships,
not bombs,

213
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:52,677
- and my men need a screen.
- Yeah, even if you get close enough,

214
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,077
your torpedoes don't work.

215
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,610
- That's a rumor.
- Yeah, it's a rumor,

216
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:57,811
'cause the damn things
have never been tested.

217
00:17:57,813 --> 00:18:00,510
Look, the Japs are out there
killing our friends.

218
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,977
Let me put a 500-pound bomb

219
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,944
right down
their goddamn smokestack.

220
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:07,046
We're not changing tactics
just because you want revenge.

221
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:20,610
Going after the Japs, sir?

222
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:22,079
Yeah, we're gonna
smoke 'em to death.

223
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,478
Japanese are attacking
on multiple fronts.

224
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,578
We captured a radio log
from a downed Japanese plane.

225
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,112
They hit us with all six
of their fleet carriers.

226
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:56,511
At least they didn't destroy
our oil tanks.

227
00:18:56,513 --> 00:18:59,411
The whole fleet would have had
to withdraw to the West Coast.

228
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:01,145
You are the best
intelligence officer

229
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:02,578
I've ever known, Layton.

230
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,413
They'll probably
burn you for this, too.

231
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,446
But if they don't,

232
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,812
swear to me,

233
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,446
you'll make the next man
in this chair listen to you.

234
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,045
See anything, sir?

235
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,780
Not even a goddamn whale.

236
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,746
Six baker 10,
this is six torpedo one.

237
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:32,612
<i>Lead us back to</i> Enterprise.

238
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,779
Six torpedo one,
your pilots aren't trained

239
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:37,146
for a night carrier landing
with live ordnance.

240
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:38,646
<i>Go land at Pearl.</i>

241
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:39,979
We can't clear the mountains.

242
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,913
Take us back to <i>Enterprise,</i>
lieutenant.

243
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,913
<i>That's an order.</i>

244
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:46,412
Six torpedo one,
I'm dropping my smoke tanks

245
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:47,813
and returning to <i>Enterprise.</i>

246
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:48,815
Follow me if you want.

247
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,380
We got word from Pearl.

248
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:12,747
The Jap fleet was north,

249
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:13,749
not south.

250
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:15,615
God damn it!

251
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:38,446
Hey, Lindsey,
this is what I was afraid of.

252
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,080
One of your men almost
blows up the damn carrier,

253
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:41,147
because you were too afraid

254
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:42,847
to get shot down
flying into Pearl.

255
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,446
Do I have to remind you

256
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:46,747
that I am your
superior officer, lieutenant?

257
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:48,647
You gonna hide
behind your rank?

258
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:49,747
Save it for the Japs.

259
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,014
We're at war now,
McClusky.

260
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,446
- When that guy screws up, people die!
- Listen to me.

261
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:55,147
You wanna keep flying?

262
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:58,514
I suggest you knock off
the cowboy bullshit.

263
00:20:58,516 --> 00:20:59,650
Come on, Murray.

264
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,616
Jesus.

265
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,716
What are they doing?

266
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,048
When she went over,
everyone below deck

267
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,883
was probably trapped inside.

268
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,850
Did you know anyone
aboard <i>Arizona?</i>

269
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,883
Yeah,

270
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,751
my roommate from the Academy.

271
00:21:46,717 --> 00:21:48,551
Lieutenant Roy Pearce.

272
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:03,882
I heard you jumped out
of a perfectly good plane.

273
00:22:03,884 --> 00:22:05,549
Well, it was on fire.

274
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:06,751
And the controls were dead.

275
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,450
Where's Miller?

276
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:13,317
Ah, hell.

277
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:15,051
Yeah.

278
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:17,450
Hey, Ann's by the gate.

279
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:19,784
Are you okay?

280
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:22,484
Yeah, I'm all right.

281
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:26,818
- Hi.
- Hey.

282
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:30,382
- Come home tonight.
- I wish.

283
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:32,749
We sail as soon
as we're refueled.

284
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,150
Look, I want you and Barb
to go back

285
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,783
to your parents' place
in Jersey.

286
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:37,950
- No.
- It's not safe here.

287
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:40,050
Everyone is saying
this is gonna be a long war.

288
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:41,817
- What if...
- You're not shipping us

289
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,652
off to Jersey
and that's final.

290
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:46,819
Did you talk to Sarah?

291
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:49,685
Was Roy aboard the <i>Arizona?</i>

292
00:22:50,785 --> 00:22:51,785
Yes.

293
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:56,583
We're checking
all the hospitals,

294
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,019
but nothing yet.

295
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:01,685
Tell her I'll find him.

296
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:11,385
Thank you.

297
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:13,518
Hey.

298
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:18,117
I heard you were
with Lieutenant Pearce

299
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,618
during the attack.

300
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:26,886
Sully...

301
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,619
what happened to him?

302
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:32,986
I don't know.

303
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:35,853
I don't know.

304
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,417
We're doing our best.

305
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,319
But they've been
bringing body parts...

306
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,086
in pillow cases.

307
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,319
There's too many.

308
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,118
He was a blond guy.

309
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,884
Tall. Probably wearing
an officer's uniform.

310
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:06,020
Officers are down here.

311
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,485
Is there anything else
you can give me?

312
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,952
Identifying features? Tattoos?

313
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:20,752
Well, he would have been
wearing our class ring

314
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:21,787
from Annapolis.

315
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,052
We, uh...

316
00:24:44,054 --> 00:24:46,854
took this off the body
when he came in.

317
00:24:54,554 --> 00:24:55,554
I'm sorry.

318
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,454
I'll give you a moment.

319
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:11,419
<i>December 7th, 1941...</i>

320

00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:30,956
Congratulations, sir.

329
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,758
You're the right man
to run the Navy.

330
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:36,056
When they get in trouble,

331
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:37,722
they send
for the sons of bitches.

332
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:09,924
The situation
in the Pacific is far worse

333
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:11,723
than has been reported.

334
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:13,057
We have three carriers.

335
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,924
The Japs have ten.

336
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,757
We have zero
functional battleships,

337
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,590
they have nine.

338
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:21,659
They have more cruisers,
more bombers, more fighters...

339
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,723
and much of their equipment
is more modern.

340
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:26,957
We'll just have to
count on the men

341
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,492
that we have out there

342
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:31,157
to hold the line.

343
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,458
I don't envy
the new commander.

344
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:42,492
It's me, isn't it?

345
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:46,892
The president asked
for you himself.

346
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,690
He said

347
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,392
that you should get the hell
out to Pearl and stay there

348
00:28:57,793 --> 00:28:59,927
until our ships
sail into Tokyo Bay.

349
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:09,860
Welcome to the most
difficult job in the world.

350
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,660
Detail. A-ten-hut!

351
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,994
Ready.

352
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:50,892
Aim.

353
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:51,894
Fire.

354
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:54,559
Aim.

355
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:55,826
Fire.

356
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:56,861
I'll be right back.

357
00:29:58,028 --> 00:29:59,627
Fire.

358
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,494
I'm so sorry.

359
00:30:06,794 --> 00:30:08,694
Roy wanted to be a pilot
like you.

360
00:30:09,894 --> 00:30:11,759
But I talked him out of it.

361
00:30:11,761 --> 00:30:13,460
I said it was too dangerous.

362
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:18,725
I'll see you
at the next funeral.

363
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:19,992
You don't have to go.

364
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:21,094
Yes, I do.

365
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:23,594
We're family.

366
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:29,026
Hey, hey, hey!

367
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,458
I just wanna say...

368
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,892
Roy Pearce was
one of the finest bastards

369
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:34,493
that I've ever met.

370
00:30:34,495 --> 00:30:36,493
And I could talk about the man
for an hour.

371
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:38,426
But I think that's a job I'll
leave up to one of you boys

372
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:39,662
that went to the Academy
with him.

373
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:43,027
What do you say?

374
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:46,660
Yeah, well, I can't let some
torpedo jockey speak for Roy.

375
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:48,726
Especially one not good enough
to fly from <i>Enterprise.</i>

376
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:51,461
- Ooh!
- Okay. Okay.

377
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:59,526
Summer after plebe year,
me, Roy and Dickie

378
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:02,593
went up to visit Roy's uncle,
up in the Great Lakes.

379
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:03,860
It was the peak
of Prohibition,

380
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,760
so one night,
we decide to sail to Canada

381
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:07,593
to buy a keg of beer.

382
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:09,562
On our way back,
right before the sun comes up,

383
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,426
the wind dies.

384
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:14,060
So, there we are,

385
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:15,927
just floating
in the middle of the lake,

386
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:18,459
waiting for the Border Patrol
to show up.

387
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,728
I said we should just ditch
the booze, but Roy...

388
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,994
Hey, Dickie,

389
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:24,128
what did Roy say?

390
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,460
"Hell, no.

391
00:31:26,462 --> 00:31:27,996
"We'll drink it all."

392
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:34,030
Roy was my best man.

393
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,429
He was the godfather
to my daughter.

394
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:41,930
I thought someday...

395
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,061
we'd be on a porch,
drinking beers,

396
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:47,596
telling lies about what we did
in the big war.

397
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,661
To Roy.

398
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:58,394
To Roy.

399
00:31:58,396 --> 00:31:59,429
To Roy.

400
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,394
Man, oh, man.

401
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:05,061
Why'd you make me drink
so much?

402
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:06,627
You might have to carry me
home, darling.

403
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,697
Oh, shit. Shore Patrol.

404
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:13,628
No, that's the admiral's flag.

405
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,461
Hey, I bet
it's the new commander.

406
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:16,795
Who do you think it is?

407
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:18,062
That looks like Nimitz.

408
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:19,895
I hear he's true-blue.

409
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,162
Hey, Nimitz!

410
00:32:21,164 --> 00:32:23,031
When are you going to let us
at those Japs?

411
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:25,428
I'm sorry, sir.

412
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,597
Do you want me
to get their names?

413
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,562
No.

414
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:29,695
I think he might have
heard you.

415
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:34,330
I'm glad at least some of
the boys still want to fight.

416
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:50,461
Welcome to Pearl, sir.

417
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:51,831
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Layton.

418
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,829
I know who you are.

419
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:56,762
Well, then you'll understand
my request.

420
00:32:56,764 --> 00:32:59,763
I wish to be reassigned
to a destroyer.

421
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:01,996
Didn't you try to warn
my predecessor

422
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:03,663
about the impending attack?

423
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:05,696
Well, not exactly. I said

424
00:33:05,698 --> 00:33:07,896
that we had lost track
of the enemy carriers

425
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:09,331
and needed to be prepared.

426
00:33:10,598 --> 00:33:11,932
I should've pushed harder.

427
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:15,529
A lesson, I assume,

428
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:17,030
you have taken to heart.

429
00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:18,429
Sir...

430
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,529
I'm the intelligence officer
responsible

431
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,930
for overseeing the greatest

432
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:24,631
intelligence failure
in American history.

433
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:27,065
Close the door.

434
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:31,763
Morale is at an all-time low

435
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:32,832
and for good reason.

436
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:37,096
The Japanese are advancing
on all fronts

437
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,763
at a terrifying pace.

438
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:40,163
I, nevertheless,

439
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:42,832
know the fighting spirit
of our men.

440
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:46,097
And I have faith in them.

441
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:49,463
But I also need to know

442
00:33:49,465 --> 00:33:51,499
that they have faith
in themselves.

443
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,797
I need you to be
my Admiral Yamamoto.

444
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,564
Get in his head. Tell me what
he's going to do next.

445
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,597
Your first assignment...

446
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,131
we need to throw a punch.

447
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,298
Not just for morale,

448
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,697
but so the Japanese know
what it feels like to be hit.

449
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:09,997
I'm sending Halsey to attack
the Marshall Islands.

450
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:11,064
But I need to know

451
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,999
that they're not
walking into a trap.

452
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,530
<i>The target is Roi Island.</i>

453
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:28,430
Our submarines have reported
shipping traffic

454
00:34:28,432 --> 00:34:30,131
and one military airfield.

455
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,764
We don't know
what we're facing,

456
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:32,998
so hit 'em as hard as possible

457
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,631
and then get the hell out.

458
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:36,531
So what about
the enemy carrier?

459
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,932
Intelligence says
they're 2,000 miles away.

460
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:40,531
You mean the same group
of geniuses

461
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:42,498
who didn't know the Japs
were gunning for Pearl?

462
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,731
Like I said,

463
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,600
be prepared for anything.

464
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,631
The early bird
catches the worm, gentlemen.

465
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:53,932
We're gonna hit that anchorage

466
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:56,431
before the Japs have even
rolled out of bed.

467
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:59,698
Looks like he spit polished
his shoes.

468
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,431
Hey, guys,
let's get home in one piece.

469
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,533
Oh, don't you worry.

470
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,832
What's the plan, sir?

471
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:09,032
The other squadrons
will strike first.

472
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:11,631
Then we go in and clean up
the remaining targets.

473
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:13,132
Japs will know we're coming.

474
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,765
What happens
if we get shot down?

475
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:17,598
Look, I'm not gonna
end up as a POW.

476
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,667
And neither are you.

477
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:29,066
I've got a large target
in my sight.

478
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:30,467
Get close enough
to make it count.

479
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,668
Start your runs, boys.
Engage torpedoes.

480
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,368
Looks like our boys on Roi
poked a hornet's nest.

481
00:36:20,702 --> 00:36:21,834
We got a problem.

482
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:24,934
I got eyes on a second enemy
airfield on Taroa Island.

483
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:27,802
<i>I'm counting maybe 30 bombers
and heavy fighter cover.</i>

484
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:30,433
You hear that, boys?

485
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:32,067
If we don't knock out
that airfield,

486
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:33,867
they'll go after <i>Enterprise.</i>

487
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:36,102
And I want a place to land
when this is over.

488
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:52,733
Enemy fighters, 11 o'clock!

489
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:54,602
We got company.
Start your runs!

490
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,503
3,000!

491
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:31,101
2,000!

492
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,668
1,900!

493
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,835
1,800!

494
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:34,837
1,600!

495
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:16,871
Get those bastards off me,
Murray!

496
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:23,639
Let's get out of here, Murray.

497
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:34,704
We got most of the bombers,
but not all of them.

498
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,604
Looks like
they almost got you.

499
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:37,940
Yeah, not enough lead.

500
00:39:42,106 --> 00:39:43,938
What, too much excitement
for ya?

501
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,804
I'm not looking
to win a medal.

502
00:39:45,806 --> 00:39:47,437
You know,
the Navy's gonna

503
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:49,437
make you pay
for this aircraft.

504
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:50,838
How'd you boys do?

505
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,372
We lost Hopping.

506
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:55,004
He never pulled out
of his dive.

507
00:39:57,573 --> 00:39:59,071
That can't be good.

508
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:05,973
Twin-engine bombers,
five o'clock.

509
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:20,371
Goddamn gunners.

510
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:23,107
Don't they know
they gotta lead those planes?

511
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:31,540
- Right standard rudder.
- Brace!

512
00:40:36,074 --> 00:40:37,540
Brace for impact!

513
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,474
What the hell is he doing?

514
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:03,608
He's turning himself
into a bomb.

515
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:22,875
Come on! Come on!

516
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:46,841
Damn, Bruno.

517
00:41:46,843 --> 00:41:48,676
Aren't they paying us
to kill Japs?

518
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,375
Admiral Halsey
wants to see you.

519
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:07,076
That's the bravest damn thing
I think I've ever seen.

520
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,740
What's your name, son?

521
00:42:09,742 --> 00:42:11,141
Bruno Gaido, sir.

522
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:13,473
Aviation Machinist's Mate,
Third Class.

523
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:15,074
Well, Bruno, you are now

524
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:17,943
an Aviation Machinist's Mate,
First Class.

525
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:25,507
Signal the fleet.

526
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,640
Tell 'em it's time
to haul ass with Halsey.

527
00:42:27,642 --> 00:42:29,041
Yes, sir.

528
00:42:29,043 --> 00:42:31,076
You heard the man.
Signal the fleet.

529
00:42:47,877 --> 00:42:50,008
Are you really sure
you want your wife

530
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,443
flying wingman
for you tonight?

531
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,675
Yeah, nobody told me

532
00:42:53,677 --> 00:42:55,408
there'd be USO girls
here tonight.

533
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,508
- Hey.
- Hey.

534
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,510
Hi.

535
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,410
I got us a table.

536
00:43:03,643 --> 00:43:05,541
Wade, have you met Ann?

537
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:06,842
Wade McClusky.

538
00:43:06,844 --> 00:43:08,077
I fly with your husband.

539
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,575
Hey, uh, you want a drink?

540
00:43:12,577 --> 00:43:14,410
I do, if you want me to dance.

541
00:43:17,144 --> 00:43:19,410
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

542
00:43:21,045 --> 00:43:22,876
How long
have you been married?

543
00:43:22,878 --> 00:43:26,409
Long enough to know
my husband's talents.

544
00:43:26,411 --> 00:43:28,377
Why isn't he commanding
a squadron?

545
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:31,176
I don't make those decisions.

546
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:33,442
- Two Mai Tai, please.
- Yes, sir.

547
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,876
I understand
before the war,

548
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,611
when it was about politics,
but now?

549
00:43:37,377 --> 00:43:39,576
I told you
she was a firecracker.

550
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:42,676
I have to say,

551
00:43:42,678 --> 00:43:45,009
I often wondered
what kind of woman

552
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:46,611
would marry Dick Best...

553
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:49,878
and, well,
you have not disappointed.

554
00:43:53,411 --> 00:43:54,511
Dick Best.

555
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:57,143
- Hey, Layton.
- Hey.

556
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:58,742
How was the Marshall Islands?

557
00:43:58,744 --> 00:44:00,344
Yeah, we got our feet wet.

558
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:03,909
You keeping tabs on me?

559
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:05,744
Ah, I'm with
Fleet Intelligence.

560
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:07,676
Thank God.

561
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,946
Yeah, we're gonna need someone
as smart as you after Pearl.

562
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:12,977
You gonna straighten
those boys out?

563
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:14,476
I'll do my best.

564
00:44:14,478 --> 00:44:16,077
Your Mai Tai, sir.

565
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,912
Well, I'm rooting for you.

566
00:44:18,946 --> 00:44:20,712
- Hey, say hi to the wife.
- You as well.

567
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:23,543
Just be straight with me.

568
00:44:23,545 --> 00:44:24,745
What am I missing?

569
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:29,378
Every time we go up
in one of those planes,

570
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:31,979
there's a chance
we won't come back.

571
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:36,946
Now, it's hard to follow a man
who doesn't know that.

572
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,445
Or even worse...

573
00:44:40,046 --> 00:44:41,046
doesn't care.

574
00:44:46,412 --> 00:44:47,643
Let's dance.

575
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:48,810
Okay.

576
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:49,977
Excuse me.

577
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,480
Come to bed.

578
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:13,614
Welcome aboard <i>Enterprise.</i>

579
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,579
You're replacing good men.

580
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:18,914
Much earlier than me
or the Navy wanted, but...

581
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:22,081
Well, that's the hand
we've been dealt.

582
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,745
Now, you're going
in the rotation,

583
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:26,645
and as XO,
it's my job to make sure

584
00:46:26,647 --> 00:46:28,781
you're worth more than
a bucket of warm spit.

585
00:46:29,647 --> 00:46:31,545
The Japs are waiting for us,

586
00:46:31,547 --> 00:46:33,646
so we need pilots
who can hold their own.

587
00:46:34,982 --> 00:46:36,713
Hey.

588
00:46:36,715 --> 00:46:37,882
You gotta see this.

589
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:07,348
What the hell are army planes
doing on a carrier?

590
00:47:10,815 --> 00:47:12,580
Well, Mr. Browning,

591
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:15,013
the commander
of those bombers?

592
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:17,413
Lieutenant Colonel
James Doolittle.

593
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:19,546
Maybe the best pilot
in the world.

594
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:23,014
And he intends to launch
his planes off the <i>Hornet,</i>

595
00:47:23,016 --> 00:47:26,447
strike Tokyo,
and then land in Free China.

596
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:27,449
Captain?

597
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:34,048
Enemy pickets 50 miles out.

598
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,514
They're gonna blow our cover.

599
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:37,848
Every mile we get Doolittle
closer to Japan,

600
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,647
is fuel he can use
to get the hell out of there.

601
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,783
But I'm not gonna
risk these carriers.

602
00:47:43,883 --> 00:47:45,581
What do we tell Doolittle?

603
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:46,816
The truth.

604
00:47:56,816 --> 00:47:58,482
We got the order to launch.

605
00:47:59,183 --> 00:48:00,583
How far out are we?

606
00:48:01,983 --> 00:48:04,114
Too far.

607
00:48:04,116 --> 00:48:06,683
We'll probably end up ditching
in the East China Sea.

608
00:48:07,816 --> 00:48:10,415
But if we bomb Tokyo,

609
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:13,149
we'll be the first enemy
in Japan's history

610
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:15,815
to hit their home territory.

611
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:17,717
If any of you want to bow out,

612
00:48:18,717 --> 00:48:19,984
now's your chance.

613
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:24,917
We all wanna fly, sir.

614
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:28,682
Man your planes.

615
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:30,017
I'll see you all in China.

616
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:36,648
They can't take off.

617
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,949
Certainly not with a load.

618
00:48:37,951 --> 00:48:40,481
And they sure as hell
can't land.

619
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:42,982
Ten bucks says they don't
make it off the deck.

620
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:44,117
Yeah, I'll take that bet.

621
00:49:27,818 --> 00:49:29,016
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

622
00:49:29,018 --> 00:49:30,083
<i>This is Radio Tokyo,</i>

623
00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:32,050
<i>talking about the collapse
of American forces</i>

624
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,283
<i>in the Philippines.</i>

625
00:49:33,285 --> 00:49:35,449
<i>Our glorious Japanese forces
have captured thousands...</i>

626
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:36,583
Evening, gents.

627
00:49:42,585 --> 00:49:44,450
What's going on, Captain?

628
00:49:44,452 --> 00:49:46,119
Those sound like
air raid sirens to me.

629
00:50:14,853 --> 00:50:16,151
Bombs away, sir.

630
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:17,552
Let's get out of here.

631
00:50:42,987 --> 00:50:44,918
- No.
- Taking these hostage.

632
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,852
Just half an hour.

633
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:48,451
Does America winning the war

634
00:50:48,453 --> 00:50:51,685
really depend on Edwin Layton
working himself to death?

635
00:50:51,687 --> 00:50:53,954
Some of our boys
bombed Tokyo today.

636
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:58,551
They were supposed
to land in Free China.

637
00:50:58,553 --> 00:50:59,852
But they're probably gonna
run out of fuel

638
00:50:59,854 --> 00:51:01,753
and have to ditch
in the China Sea.

639
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,818
If, by some miracle,
they actually make it

640
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,918
into Japanese
occupied territory,

641
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,520
they'll be tortured
and executed.

642
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:11,587
What can you do?

643
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,587
Most likely nothing.

644
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,185
But we're not gonna
lose any more men

645
00:51:16,187 --> 00:51:17,753
because I didn't
dig deep enough.

646
00:51:24,688 --> 00:51:25,855
I'll fix you a sandwich.

647
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:38,986
I keep recalculating,

648
00:51:38,988 --> 00:51:40,886
but with this
steady tailwind...

649
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:42,055
You think we're over land?

650
00:51:42,921 --> 00:51:44,419
Yeah. Maybe.

651
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:48,354
Only one way to find out.

652
00:51:59,888 --> 00:52:00,955
Everyone. We gotta bail out.

653
00:52:13,689 --> 00:52:16,420
I don't know if we're
over Chinese or Jap territory.

654
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:17,687
So, watch yourselves.

655
00:52:17,689 --> 00:52:18,989
I'll see you all in Quzhou.

656
00:52:29,555 --> 00:52:30,589
You're next, Potter.

657
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,671
The Japanese
are sending their carriers

658
00:53:42,673 --> 00:53:44,240
into the Coral Sea.

659
00:53:44,674 --> 00:53:45,739
Yes, sir.

660
00:53:45,741 --> 00:53:48,407
They're trying to break
our lifeline with Australia.

661
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:55,305
Send a secure message
to Admiral Halsey.

662
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:56,439
I want <i>Enterprise</i> to join

663
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,772
<i>Yorktown</i> and <i>Lexington</i>
in the Coral Sea.

664
00:53:58,774 --> 00:54:01,372
And tell Halsey
time is a factor.

665
00:54:01,374 --> 00:54:02,572
There's something else.

666
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:04,272
There always is.

667
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,439
I heard a theory.

668
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:06,806
What kind of theory?

669
00:54:06,808 --> 00:54:08,138
According to
one of my officers,

670
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,305
Coral Sea
is just a warm-up.

671
00:54:09,307 --> 00:54:11,572
He thinks that the Japanese
are planning something bigger.

672
00:54:11,574 --> 00:54:12,706
Much bigger.

673
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,305
What makes him think that?

674
00:54:14,307 --> 00:54:17,105
Little bits and pieces
that we've intercepted.

675
00:54:17,107 --> 00:54:18,672
A message about a
battleship not being ready

676
00:54:18,674 --> 00:54:20,138
for an upcoming operation.

677
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,205
Request for maps
of the Aleutian Islands.

678
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,372
What's the target?

679
00:54:23,374 --> 00:54:24,374
We don't know yet.

680
00:54:25,374 --> 00:54:27,772
Do you trust this officer?

681
00:54:27,774 --> 00:54:30,205
He's the most brilliant man
I know.

682
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:32,008
Well, have him figure it out.

683
00:54:36,627 --> 00:54:38,394
Always no match.

684
00:54:48,933 --> 00:54:50,067
Keep it.

685
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,733
Thank you.

686
00:55:21,034 --> 00:55:22,634
There are
no installations here.

687
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:25,765
What's their target?

688
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:27,166
People are target.

689
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:29,034
People.

690
00:55:31,734 --> 00:55:33,299
People.

691
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:34,868
And we just made it worse.

692
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:46,999
24 hours too late.

693
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:49,001
Damn it. Why couldn't
we have been here?

694
00:55:50,134 --> 00:55:51,299
This leaves us and <i>Hornet</i>

695
00:55:51,301 --> 00:55:52,967
as the only carriers
in the Pacific.

696
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:01,001
Attention on deck.

697
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:07,435
I wanna talk
to McClusky and Best.

698
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,135
As you were.

699
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:19,102
Oh, for Christ's sake.

700
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,066
You okay, Admiral?

701
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:23,569
I got this damn rash.

702
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:27,400
Listen up.
I'm done playing politics.

703
00:56:27,402 --> 00:56:28,434
The Navy...

704
00:56:28,436 --> 00:56:32,233
hell, the whole damn country
is counting on us.

705
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:34,667
And I need my best men
in the right spots.

706
00:56:34,669 --> 00:56:36,269
So, McClusky,

707
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,968
you are now in charge
of the air group.

708
00:56:40,736 --> 00:56:42,367
I don't have
a lick of confidence

709
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:44,066
in those damn torpedoes.

710
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,436
So, I want you
in a dive bomber.

711
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:48,534
And, Best,

712
00:56:48,536 --> 00:56:50,302
I'm bumping you up from XO.

713
00:56:52,335 --> 00:56:54,569
You're the new skipper
of Bombing Six.

714
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,003
Good luck, boys.

715
00:57:01,303 --> 00:57:03,670
Well, I guess you're gonna
have to learn to fly an SBD.

716
00:57:04,637 --> 00:57:07,268
I've logged plenty of hours
in the Dauntless.

717
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,401
Not diving at a live target.

718
00:57:09,403 --> 00:57:10,701
Can't be that hard.

719
00:57:10,703 --> 00:57:12,936
I mean, you do it.

720
00:58:37,238 --> 00:58:39,470
So, I just got
off the phone with Washington,

721
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:41,136
and their intelligence guys

722
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:43,637
think you're wrong
about this big operation.

723
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:45,637
They think that the Japs
are sending their carriers

724
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:47,036
back into the Coral Sea.

725
00:58:47,038 --> 00:58:49,670
Yeah, and they've ordered me
to keep <i>Enterprise</i> down there.

726
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:50,637
That's a mistake.

727
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:53,203
Washington is starting
from a faulty assumption

728
00:58:53,205 --> 00:58:55,637
and looking for evidence
to corroborate it.

729
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:57,572
So, what's
the Japs' real target?

730
00:58:58,138 --> 00:59:00,003
We believe it's Midway.

731
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:02,036
They see our base there
as a step towards Hawaii

732
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,572
and eventually the West Coast.

733
00:59:04,672 --> 00:59:06,003
When?

734
00:59:06,005 --> 00:59:07,138
In a few weeks.

735
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:11,136
I think it's time
to pay a visit

736
00:59:11,138 --> 00:59:12,637
to your friends
in Station HYPO.

737
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:14,405
Matt, bring the car around.

738
00:59:25,373 --> 00:59:28,137
I have to warn you, sir,
codebreakers are a rare breed.

739
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:30,471
Rochefort's way of doing
things is especially...

740
00:59:30,473 --> 00:59:31,704
particular.

741
00:59:31,706 --> 00:59:34,171
I don't care if he consults
coffee grounds

742
00:59:34,173 --> 00:59:35,371
while doing the boogie-woogie

743
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:37,438
as long as the intel is good.

744
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,573
Attention on deck.

745
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,039
Carry on, gentlemen.

746
00:59:43,606 --> 00:59:44,640
Where's Rochefort?

747
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:49,037
If you'll follow me, sir.

748
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:50,304
Didn't realize that the Navy

749
00:59:50,306 --> 00:59:52,704
had so many
trained codebreakers.

750
00:59:52,706 --> 00:59:53,905
We don't.

751
00:59:53,907 --> 00:59:56,604
Most of these men were
in the band on the <i>California.</i>

752
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:59,638
But since we don't have
much use for bands these days,

753
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,404
Rochefort thought that
their musical abilities

754
01:00:01,406 --> 01:00:02,504
might make them naturals

755
01:00:02,506 --> 01:00:04,440
at breaking the rhythms
of ciphers.

756
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:19,405
Sorry, Admiral, it, uh,

757
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,541
gets cold down here
in the dungeon.

758
01:00:22,741 --> 01:00:24,340
I'm told you're brilliant.

759
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,105
Well,
Lieutenant Commander Layton

760
01:00:29,107 --> 01:00:31,405
has been known to exaggerate.

761
01:00:31,407 --> 01:00:33,272
I hope not.

762
01:00:33,274 --> 01:00:35,071
He told me
he's absolutely certain

763
01:00:35,073 --> 01:00:36,305
the Japs are gonna hit Midway

764
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:37,474
and I need to know

765
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,539
whether or not
I can believe him.

766
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:42,005
Well, if you don't
believe him,

767
01:00:42,007 --> 01:00:43,107
we'll all be
speaking Japanese.

768
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,641
Or, most likely,
we'll be dead.

769
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,240
Show me how this works.

770
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,405
You mean, like a tour?

771
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:55,475
Exactly.

772
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:57,573
Like a tour.

773
01:00:57,575 --> 01:00:59,039
So, this is where it starts.

774
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:01,072
We intercept roughly 60%

775
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,640
of secure Japanese
radio traffic

776
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,273
and we've cracked
enough of their code

777
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:07,239
to be able to break about 40%
of those messages.

778
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:09,473
So, we're able to read
about a quarter

779
01:01:09,475 --> 01:01:11,339
of their secure
communications?

780
01:01:11,341 --> 01:01:13,573
Uh, no, not exactly.

781
01:01:13,575 --> 01:01:15,406
Here's some of our, uh,

782
01:01:15,408 --> 01:01:17,108
cracked messages.

783
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,139
It's gibberish to me.

784
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:23,573
Yes, but if you read
enough of it...

785
01:01:23,575 --> 01:01:25,606
Rochefort has a gift
for assembling the fragments.

786
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:27,673
He can recall a message
from two months ago,

787
01:01:27,675 --> 01:01:30,206
and plug it
into today's intercept.

788
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:32,108
Explain the disagreement
with Washington.

789
01:01:33,175 --> 01:01:34,139
Well,

790
01:01:34,141 --> 01:01:37,673
we all have access
to the same raw information,

791
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:41,041
but, uh, over here,
is where our paths diverge.

792
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:43,307
Translation and analysis.

793
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:44,474
Now, Washington agrees with us

794
01:01:44,476 --> 01:01:47,474
that Japs are gonna attack
a major target codenamed AF.

795
01:01:47,476 --> 01:01:49,307
But Washington believes
that AF

796
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:50,741
is located
in the South Pacific,

797
01:01:50,743 --> 01:01:54,107
which is why they ordered you
to keep <i>Enterprise</i> down there.

798
01:01:54,109 --> 01:01:56,674
Do you have any direct proof
that they're wrong?

799
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:58,042
Direct proof? No, but...

800
01:01:59,376 --> 01:02:00,576
Sir.

801
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:04,140
Imagine that
you're throwing a wedding.

802
01:02:04,142 --> 01:02:06,307
And maybe I've never seen
the invitation,

803
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:07,441
but I hear from the caterers

804
01:02:07,443 --> 01:02:09,374
that they have an event
on a certain date.

805
01:02:09,376 --> 01:02:11,474
The flower guy is buying up
all the roses

806
01:02:11,476 --> 01:02:12,607
on the island.

807
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:14,541
The best band is booked.

808
01:02:14,543 --> 01:02:17,276
That's what signal
intelligence can give you.

809
01:02:17,709 --> 01:02:19,340
Clues.

810
01:02:19,342 --> 01:02:21,207
Not a definitive answer.

811
01:02:21,209 --> 01:02:24,207
Sir? After Pearl, you told me
to stick to my guns.

812
01:02:24,209 --> 01:02:26,409
I swear to you,
Joe's right about this.

813
01:02:30,075 --> 01:02:32,475
I'm not generally predisposed

814
01:02:32,477 --> 01:02:35,275
to trust a bunch
of tuba players

815
01:02:35,277 --> 01:02:38,608
led by a man
wearing fuzzy slippers.

816
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:40,408
But...

817
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:42,742
I'll figure a way to get
the <i>Enterprise</i> back here.

818
01:02:42,744 --> 01:02:47,210
Meantime, you gentlemen
need to convince Washington

819
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:51,642
that the Japs' real target
is Midway.

820
01:02:51,644 --> 01:02:52,542
How, sir?

821
01:02:52,544 --> 01:02:54,542
Washington doesn't
exactly have a habit

822
01:02:54,544 --> 01:02:55,710
of listening to us.

823
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,943
Well, I'm sure
you'll think of something.

824
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,610
Come in.

825
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,477
An eyes-only message
from Pearl.

826
01:03:21,545 --> 01:03:22,545
Nimitz.

827
01:03:23,711 --> 01:03:26,075
He wants us to be spotted.

828
01:03:26,077 --> 01:03:28,042
Because if the Japs see us,

829
01:03:28,044 --> 01:03:29,609
we can break
our standing orders

830
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:31,711
with Washington
and return to Pearl.

831
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,411
We never received
this message.

832
01:03:41,344 --> 01:03:43,044
<i>Sir?
The admiral needs you.</i>

833
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:47,511
Okay.

834
01:03:48,144 --> 01:03:50,443
Yeah. Okay.

835
01:03:50,445 --> 01:03:51,711
Well, keep me informed.

836
01:03:53,144 --> 01:03:54,476
That was Washington.

837
01:03:54,478 --> 01:03:57,276
They've intercepted
several Japanese messages

838
01:03:57,278 --> 01:03:59,678
claiming that the target
of their upcoming attack

839
01:04:00,244 --> 01:04:02,176
is out of fresh water.

840
01:04:02,178 --> 01:04:04,276
Interesting, sir.

841
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:07,177
I heard that
Midway accidentally sent out

842
01:04:07,179 --> 01:04:08,744
an unencrypted transmission

843
01:04:08,746 --> 01:04:11,210
that their water plant
was broken.

844
01:04:11,212 --> 01:04:12,679
And is their water plant
broken?

845
01:04:14,212 --> 01:04:16,076
Not that I know of, sir.

846
01:04:16,078 --> 01:04:18,112
But that proves Midway is AF.

847
01:04:22,012 --> 01:04:23,777
Okay, tell your man, Rochefort

848
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:25,177
that everyone now agrees

849
01:04:25,179 --> 01:04:27,210
on where his wedding
is gonna be held.

850
01:04:27,212 --> 01:04:30,210
We just need to know
how many guests are coming

851
01:04:30,212 --> 01:04:33,078
and when they plan to arrive.

852
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,445
Mack, I think
we found the spot.

853
01:04:55,447 --> 01:04:56,511
Can't say,
Mr. Ford,

854
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:58,611
that I've ever helped
a big-time Hollywood director

855
01:04:58,613 --> 01:05:00,378
scout for a movie before.

856
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,678
What kind of film
you planning to make

857
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,778
in a godforsaken place
like this?

858
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,645
Friend of mine
in the Navy said

859
01:05:05,647 --> 01:05:08,711
that I might be able
to find some real action here.

860
01:05:08,713 --> 01:05:10,745
I think I've been hoodwinked.

861
01:05:10,747 --> 01:05:11,645
I don't know, sir.
From the way

862
01:05:11,647 --> 01:05:13,611
we've been fortifying
this little island,

863
01:05:13,613 --> 01:05:16,046
I'd say your friend
has some good intel.

864
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,180
Attention on deck.

865
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,380
Very funny.

866
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,613
Sit the hell down.

867
01:05:29,046 --> 01:05:30,711
I'm gonna keep this short.

868
01:05:30,713 --> 01:05:31,778
I know some of you thought

869
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:34,711
I was a pain in the ass
as XO...

870
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:36,678
Well, that's about
to get worse.

871
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,678
We're headed back to Pearl
to resupply,

872
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,244
and it's probably
because something big

873
01:05:40,246 --> 01:05:42,278
is coming down the pipe.

874
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,245
I'm therefore doubling
our scouting flights

875
01:05:44,247 --> 01:05:46,245
and I expect you
to practice diving runs

876
01:05:46,247 --> 01:05:48,145
whenever you get a chance.

877
01:05:48,147 --> 01:05:50,045
Don't be the man
who lets down the squadron

878
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:51,648
when we finally face the Japs.

879
01:05:53,548 --> 01:05:54,548
Dismissed.

880
01:06:03,147 --> 01:06:04,347
Can I talk to you, sir?

881
01:06:08,114 --> 01:06:09,414
I don't know
if I can do this, sir.

882
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,047
I thought I was a good pilot,

883
01:06:13,281 --> 01:06:15,381
but I've lost my confidence.

884
01:06:18,414 --> 01:06:20,114
Why did you become a pilot?

885
01:06:21,781 --> 01:06:25,112
Your dad wanted you
to be an officer, huh?

886
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:28,414
Actually, my dad didn't have
much respect for officers.

887
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:30,612
Said that most of them
didn't know

888
01:06:30,614 --> 01:06:31,981
their ass from their elbow.

889
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,280
You know, my dad was
a tough son of a bitch.

890
01:06:36,282 --> 01:06:38,513
You know
how I got his respect?

891
01:06:38,515 --> 01:06:40,148
By always staying
in the fight.

892
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:42,747
I wish I had the luxury

893
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,747
of worrying
about your confidence,

894
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:46,148
but we're short on pilots,

895
01:06:47,182 --> 01:06:48,215
so, you gotta suck it up.

896
01:06:50,415 --> 01:06:51,415
Yes, sir.

897
01:06:52,415 --> 01:06:53,415
Wait.

898
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:00,313
From now on,
you're my wingman.

899
01:07:00,315 --> 01:07:02,346
I'll be lookin' out for you.

900
01:07:02,348 --> 01:07:04,315
Now go suit up
for a scouting flight.

901
01:07:07,549 --> 01:07:08,549
Tell me.

902
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:10,515
What's your secret?

903
01:07:11,415 --> 01:07:12,680
My secret?

904
01:07:12,682 --> 01:07:14,615
He wants to know
why nothing bothers you.

905
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:19,082
My uncle was a welder
on the Empire State Building.

906
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:20,581
He'd walk on a beam,

907
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:23,448
1,000 feet up in the sky,
no ropes, nothing.

908
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:25,414
And everyone thought
he was crazy,

909
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,314
but to him,
he was just doing a job.

910
01:07:27,316 --> 01:07:29,347
And one Sunday,
he's walking home from church.

911
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,614
He's a block
away from his house,

912
01:07:30,616 --> 01:07:33,481
when a cab
jumps over the curb,

913
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:35,281
splatters him like a bug.

914
01:07:35,283 --> 01:07:36,650
You never know
what's gonna get you.

915
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,082
So, why worry about it?

916
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:43,550
Hey. Let's go.

917
01:07:45,316 --> 01:07:47,114
Simple scouting mission.

918
01:07:47,116 --> 01:07:49,481
On the way home, we'll
practice the dive, you got it?

919
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:50,548
Yes, sir.

920
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,014
We'll be going deeper
this time,

921
01:07:52,016 --> 01:07:53,781
so don't pull up too fast
on the bottom

922
01:07:53,783 --> 01:07:55,047
or you'll black out.

923
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,382
Oh, shit.

924
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:18,250
The ship's moving too slow.

925
01:08:45,217 --> 01:08:47,584
Abort! Abort takeoff!

926
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:51,384
<i>The ship's too slow!</i>

927
01:08:52,651 --> 01:08:54,783
We're not generating
enough wind for launch.

928
01:08:54,785 --> 01:08:57,151
No, stop! Stop!

929
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:12,516
Plane in water.

930
01:09:12,518 --> 01:09:13,783
<i>Plane in water.</i>

931
01:09:13,785 --> 01:09:15,583
Turn starboard, God damn it!

932
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:16,951
<i>Turn starboard.</i>

933
01:09:55,152 --> 01:09:57,651
Guess you don't like
the chokers either.

934
01:09:57,653 --> 01:10:01,451
I'd get grease on that thing
just trying to button it up.

935
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:04,117
Makes me look
like a damn waiter.

936
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:06,717
Nobody would ever confuse you
for a waiter.

937
01:10:09,786 --> 01:10:11,152
You look like hell, Bill.

938
01:10:11,686 --> 01:10:13,352
I'm fine.

939
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:16,017
Tired.

940
01:10:16,019 --> 01:10:17,651
Every man on the ship's tired.

941
01:10:17,653 --> 01:10:19,584
We've been out six months
without a break.

942
01:10:19,586 --> 01:10:20,584
There's a big difference

943
01:10:20,586 --> 01:10:23,751
between tired
and whatever the hell you are.

944
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:26,617
You're going ashore
to the hospital.

945
01:10:26,619 --> 01:10:28,751
Does this look like
a battle wound to you?

946
01:10:28,753 --> 01:10:30,451
It's a damn rash.

947
01:10:30,453 --> 01:10:32,518
Now, what are my men
gonna think

948
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,351
when their admiral
up and decides

949
01:10:34,353 --> 01:10:35,652
he needs a vacation?

950
01:10:35,654 --> 01:10:37,253
It's a direct order, Bill.

951
01:10:46,654 --> 01:10:48,320
And we keep losing men.

952
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:50,220
It's not even the Japs.

953
01:10:51,287 --> 01:10:52,718
Herman crashed on takeoff.

954
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,420
Tom Durkin disappeared
on patrol.

955
01:10:55,086 --> 01:10:56,587
And there's this other kid...

956
01:10:58,287 --> 01:10:59,554
Willie West.

957
01:11:00,654 --> 01:11:02,552
He didn't think
he could cut it.

958
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:04,320
I figured it was
just the usual jitters.

959
01:11:05,287 --> 01:11:06,953
I take him under my wing.

960
01:11:09,687 --> 01:11:12,051
I wrote a letter
to his mother yesterday

961
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:13,587
telling her I failed him.

962
01:11:22,788 --> 01:11:24,388
It's not your fault.

963
01:11:25,388 --> 01:11:26,688
He was right to be scared.

964
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:31,286
Everybody knows
something big is coming.

965
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:32,753
We're talking about
a couple dozen planes

966
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,085
against the whole
Japanese fleet.

967
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:37,121
And if we lose,
they own the Pacific,

968
01:11:37,788 --> 01:11:40,553
and they raid the West Coast.

969
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:43,321
Seattle, San Francisco,
Los Angeles...

970
01:11:44,555 --> 01:11:46,186
will burn.

971
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:48,321
And this damn war
will last a decade.

972
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:52,954
I've never seen you
this worried before.

973
01:11:54,087 --> 01:11:56,555
I never had to worry when
it was just me and my plane...

974
01:11:59,421 --> 01:12:01,488
but, Ann, it's different now.
I have to lead these men.

975
01:12:03,655 --> 01:12:05,586
What do I say to them?

976
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:06,622
Just...

977
01:12:07,522 --> 01:12:08,556
be honest.

978
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:12,322
And let them
see what I can see.

979
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:17,355
They'll follow you anywhere,
Dick Best.

980
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:39,220
<i>Sir, the</i> Yorktown <i>was hit</i>

981
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:40,754
<i>by a 500-pound bomb.</i>

982
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,754
We need at least two weeks
for repairs.

983
01:12:42,756 --> 01:12:44,487
Not acceptable.

984
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:47,522
Our initial estimate was three
months in dry dock in Seattle.

985
01:12:52,556 --> 01:12:54,688
I need this ship.

986
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:59,054
I don't care if you need to
patch the deck with plywood.

987
01:12:59,056 --> 01:13:01,657
<i>Yorktown</i> sails in 72 hours.

988
01:13:04,323 --> 01:13:06,087
Halsey is out.

989
01:13:06,089 --> 01:13:07,721
He's in the hospital
with shingles.

990
01:13:07,723 --> 01:13:10,388
So I've given command
of Task Force 16

991
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:11,688
to Admiral Spruance.

992
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,121
We're setting a trap.

993
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:14,788
Our carriers
will lie in wait

994
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,388
northeast of Midway.

995
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:20,354
Now, we have set up a picket
line of submarines here.

996
01:13:20,356 --> 01:13:21,588
As for Midway itself,

997
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:24,788
we have crammed every plane
we can spare onto that runway.

998
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:27,288
But this time, if we're lucky,

999
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:29,223
surprise will be on our side.

1000
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,121
Layton, how reliable
are these estimates

1001
01:13:34,123 --> 01:13:35,588
of the Japanese positions?

1002
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,354
They represent our best guess,

1003
01:13:37,356 --> 01:13:39,254
based on the intelligence
that we have.

1004
01:13:39,256 --> 01:13:42,656
I can't plan
around your guess.

1005
01:13:42,658 --> 01:13:45,522
I understand that we're asking
the impossible,

1006
01:13:45,524 --> 01:13:47,689
but we need you
to be specific.

1007
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:53,022
The Japanese will attack
on the morning of June 4th

1008
01:13:53,024 --> 01:13:57,022
from the northwest,
at a bearing of 325 degrees.

1009
01:13:57,024 --> 01:13:59,722
They will be sighted 175 miles
from Midway

1010
01:13:59,724 --> 01:14:01,524
at 0700 local time.

1011
01:14:04,324 --> 01:14:06,424
I trust Layton and his team.

1012
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:08,724
Make your plans accordingly.

1013
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:10,724
Dismissed.

1014
01:14:14,057 --> 01:14:15,088
<i>Clear the deck.</i>

1015
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:18,122
<i>Torpedo Squadron Six
coming in from Pearl.</i>

1016
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:19,155
<i>Clear the deck.</i>

1017
01:14:19,157 --> 01:14:21,724
<i>Torpedo Squadron Six
coming in from Pearl.</i>

1018
01:14:28,591 --> 01:14:30,191
He's in trouble.

1019
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:33,991
Shit.

1020
01:14:37,358 --> 01:14:39,723
<i>We need a rescue team!</i>

1021
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,723
- Easy. Easy. Easy.
- Easy, boys. Easy.

1022
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:44,690
Get him over.

1023
01:14:44,692 --> 01:14:46,190
Hand him off. One, two, three.

1024
01:14:46,192 --> 01:14:48,290
Easy, Lieutenant.

1025
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:49,459
How's your back doing,
Lieutenant?

1026
01:14:50,459 --> 01:14:52,991
It feels like someone dropped
a tractor on it.

1027
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:58,256
So, that's what
your squadrons are up against?

1028
01:14:58,258 --> 01:14:59,757
Four carriers.

1029
01:14:59,759 --> 01:15:02,123
Approximately 250 aircraft,

1030
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:03,757
plus the biggest battleship
in the world.

1031
01:15:03,759 --> 01:15:06,390
Yeah, not to mention
the Japs are unbeatable.

1032
01:15:06,392 --> 01:15:08,325
We've got the drop
on the bastards.

1033
01:15:09,425 --> 01:15:10,459
Make it count.

1034
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:14,690
How's Lindsey?

1035
01:15:14,692 --> 01:15:15,725
Not good, sir.

1036
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:26,724
Do you trust the intelligence?

1037
01:15:26,726 --> 01:15:27,858
I'm trying.

1038
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,624
Because we're betting
a hell of a lot on this hand.

1039
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:31,624
Yeah.

1040
01:15:31,626 --> 01:15:33,959
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but, uh...

1041
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:37,458
I liked you better
when you were cocky.

1042
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:39,057
Hey, you don't
have to worry about me.

1043
01:15:39,059 --> 01:15:40,491
Oh, really?

1044
01:15:40,493 --> 01:15:43,059
You've been blaming yourself
for that kid who went down.

1045
01:15:44,593 --> 01:15:47,157
How do I make it right?

1046
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:50,124
Make sure your men
are ready for tomorrow.

1047
01:15:50,126 --> 01:15:52,291
And you bring back
as many of 'em as you can.

1048
01:15:54,426 --> 01:15:55,426
Ship sighted.

1049
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,424
It's the <i>Yorktown!</i>

1050
01:16:07,561 --> 01:16:08,425
How the hell

1051
01:16:08,427 --> 01:16:10,327
did she get out of dry dock
in time?

1052
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:12,692
I don't know.

1053
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:15,125
I guess every battle
needs a miracle.

1054
01:16:15,127 --> 01:16:16,127
Whoo!

1055
01:16:17,627 --> 01:16:19,625
You've memorized
every position

1056
01:16:19,627 --> 01:16:21,358
on that board, Layton.

1057
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,425
Go home.

1058
01:16:22,427 --> 01:16:24,792
I think I'm going
to spend the night here, sir,

1059
01:16:24,794 --> 01:16:26,327
just in case
anything comes up.

1060
01:16:27,294 --> 01:16:29,192
Your wife doesn't mind?

1061
01:16:29,194 --> 01:16:31,091
Well, she knows the drill.

1062
01:16:31,093 --> 01:16:33,661
My wife knows the drill, too,
but she still minds.

1063
01:16:35,627 --> 01:16:36,525
And when the war's over,

1064
01:16:36,527 --> 01:16:38,225
I plan on spending
the rest of my life

1065
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:39,227
making it up to her.

1066
01:16:40,727 --> 01:16:42,258
Get some rest.

1067
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:43,260
Good night.

1068
01:17:07,595 --> 01:17:09,793
They've
scrambled all the squadrons.

1069
01:17:09,795 --> 01:17:12,326
Radar must've
picked up something.

1070
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:15,159
That's great, Mikey,
that's great.

1071
01:17:15,161 --> 01:17:17,359
Next time, get the horn up
a little higher, all right?

1072
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:18,760
- All right, sir.
- A little higher. Good.

1073
01:17:18,762 --> 01:17:20,328
All right. Lower the flag,
we're going again.

1074
01:17:24,261 --> 01:17:25,662
Get something
in your stomachs.

1075
01:17:27,195 --> 01:17:28,595
It's gonna be a long day.

1076
01:17:36,462 --> 01:17:38,560
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
boys.

1077
01:17:38,562 --> 01:17:41,395
Nobody thinks we can go
toe-to-toe with the Japanese.

1078
01:17:42,228 --> 01:17:43,463
Not in a fair fight.

1079
01:17:45,196 --> 01:17:47,196
Today, we're gonna
be big underdogs.

1080
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:48,627
Me?

1081
01:17:48,629 --> 01:17:51,594
I think the men in this room
can fly with anyone.

1082
01:17:51,596 --> 01:17:53,962
Maybe that's 'cause
I'm a cocky son of a bitch.

1083
01:17:56,062 --> 01:17:58,296
But it's also because
I've seen what you can do.

1084
01:18:01,729 --> 01:18:03,196
You're ready for this.

1085
01:18:11,296 --> 01:18:13,627
We're gonna give 'em
a shellackin'.

1086
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,795
They're coming!
The Japs are coming!

1087
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:57,161
Mr. Ford, we have
incoming aircrafts.

1088
01:18:57,163 --> 01:18:58,428
We need to get you
to a bunker.

1089
01:19:00,096 --> 01:19:02,228
Incoming aircrafts?

1090
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:03,697
Sir, you have to take cover,
sir.

1091
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,028
Holy shit! To the roof!

1092
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:09,595
Mr. Ford, wait!

1093
01:19:09,597 --> 01:19:11,195
With all due respect, sir,

1094
01:19:11,197 --> 01:19:12,361
there isn't going to be
a movie, sir,

1095
01:19:12,363 --> 01:19:13,228
if we don't get you to cover.

1096
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:15,728
I'm gonna shoot
the damn picture.

1097
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:16,730
Got it, Jackie?

1098
01:19:17,397 --> 01:19:18,598
Beautiful!

1099
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:38,696
Are you okay?

1100
01:19:38,698 --> 01:19:40,698
Keep shooting. Keep shooting!

1101
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,763
Japanese air attack
reported on Midway.

1102
01:19:47,765 --> 01:19:49,731
And one of our scout planes
just sighted the enemy fleet.

1103
01:19:50,164 --> 01:19:51,496
Spotted where?

1104
01:19:51,498 --> 01:19:53,663
He reports carriers
bearing 320 degrees,

1105
01:19:53,665 --> 01:19:56,729
180 miles northwest of Midway.

1106
01:19:56,731 --> 01:19:59,296
Well, Layton, you
and Rochefort were only off

1107
01:19:59,298 --> 01:20:01,729
five minutes,
five miles and five degrees.

1108
01:20:01,731 --> 01:20:03,631
Well, we'll endeavor
to do better next time, sir.

1109
01:20:05,298 --> 01:20:07,063
Give our pilots
the enemy position.

1110
01:20:07,065 --> 01:20:08,197
Tell them to attack.

1111
01:20:08,199 --> 01:20:09,332
Yes, sir.

1112
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,201
Hey, Lindsey,

1113
01:22:22,367 --> 01:22:24,466
you still owe me 10 bucks.

1114
01:22:24,468 --> 01:22:27,499
You trying to collect
before I get myself shot down?

1115
01:22:27,501 --> 01:22:29,599
Nah, I know you're good
for it, Lindsey.

1116
01:22:29,601 --> 01:22:31,567
You don't have to fly today.

1117
01:22:31,569 --> 01:22:33,767
Nobody would doubt
your courage.

1118
01:22:33,769 --> 01:22:35,669
I will lead my squadron in.

1119
01:22:41,469 --> 01:22:42,700
Good luck, sir.

1120
01:22:42,702 --> 01:22:44,300
I'll be right behind you.

1121
01:22:44,302 --> 01:22:46,502
I'll meet you
at the Japanese fleet.

1122
01:24:14,337 --> 01:24:16,135
They got
a <i>Jintsu</i> type cruiser.

1123
01:24:16,137 --> 01:24:17,335
Range 2,500 yards.

1124
01:24:17,337 --> 01:24:19,302
I'm not wasting a torpedo
on a cruiser.

1125
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,304
Where are the carriers?

1126
01:24:29,804 --> 01:24:31,368
Sir, we need to go deep.

1127
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:32,370
Man battle stations.

1128
01:24:33,771 --> 01:24:36,268
Battle stations.
Everybody, in your bunks.

1129
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:44,304
Well, Murray,

1130
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:46,337
this is it.

1131
01:25:25,038 --> 01:25:26,603
The <i>Enterprise</i> has launched
its SBDs

1132
01:25:26,605 --> 01:25:28,536
and their squadrons
of marine dive bombers

1133
01:25:28,538 --> 01:25:30,672
following a new
sighting report out of Midway.

1134
01:25:35,138 --> 01:25:37,336
<i>We gotta climb higher, boys.</i>

1135
01:25:37,338 --> 01:25:39,004
We need to conserve fuel.

1136
01:25:41,205 --> 01:25:43,804
Approaching altitude
14,000 feet.

1137
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:45,506
Release your oxygen, sir.

1138
01:25:55,339 --> 01:25:57,103
Are you okay, sir?

1139
01:25:57,105 --> 01:25:59,037
It's my oxygen.

1140
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:00,771
Must've gotten a bad mix.

1141
01:26:00,773 --> 01:26:02,237
We have to go back.

1142
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:03,637
It'll tear up your lungs.

1143
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:05,571
I'm not sending
the squadron out there

1144
01:26:05,573 --> 01:26:07,339
without their commander.

1145
01:26:08,573 --> 01:26:10,537
There she is.

1146
01:26:10,539 --> 01:26:12,737
We got a carrier,
maybe 4,000 yards.

1147
01:26:12,739 --> 01:26:14,571
Sir, the Japs are right on us.

1148
01:26:14,573 --> 01:26:16,204
Make tubes one and two ready.

1149
01:26:16,206 --> 01:26:18,270
Make tubes one and two
ready in all respects.

1150
01:26:18,272 --> 01:26:20,237
Make tubes one and two
ready in all respects.

1151
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:21,372
Tubes one and two ready, aye.

1152
01:26:26,473 --> 01:26:27,704
Flood down tube one.

1153
01:26:27,706 --> 01:26:28,706
Flood down tube one, aye.

1154
01:26:42,774 --> 01:26:43,973
Bearing.

1155
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,440
Mark.

1156
01:27:00,207 --> 01:27:01,738
- Matched.
- Tube one.

1157
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:03,006
Fire!

1158
01:27:36,107 --> 01:27:38,272
Six Baker 10,
do you have visual?

1159
01:27:41,374 --> 01:27:42,539
Nothin'.

1160
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:45,673
Must've gotten
a bum sighting report.

1161
01:27:45,675 --> 01:27:47,708
Or maybe
they've changed course.

1162
01:27:49,274 --> 01:27:50,974
Let's do a back search.

1163
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:54,174
Here they come again.

1164
01:28:19,175 --> 01:28:20,740
Target spotted.

1165
01:29:32,543 --> 01:29:33,743
The screws are fading.

1166
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:36,541
I think they're leaving, sir.

1167
01:29:36,543 --> 01:29:38,076
Take us to periscope depth.

1168
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:51,010
Enemy destroyer's
headed back to her fleet.

1169
01:30:03,244 --> 01:30:04,676
I've got a ship.

1170
01:30:04,678 --> 01:30:06,509
Jap destroyer at flank speed.

1171
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:07,409
What do you wanna bet

1172
01:30:07,411 --> 01:30:09,108
she's trying to catch up
with the carriers?

1173
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:10,442
<i>Sir, we've been up here</i>

1174
01:30:10,444 --> 01:30:11,509
<i>for almost two hours.</i>

1175
01:30:11,511 --> 01:30:13,108
What if we run out of fuel

1176
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:14,578
and the whole squadron
has to ditch?

1177
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:16,809
Then I'll probably end up

1178
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:18,411
scrubbing potatoes
at Leavenworth.

1179
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:21,142
To hell with it.

1180
01:30:21,144 --> 01:30:22,144
Follow me, boys.

1181
01:30:31,612 --> 01:30:33,743
I hope you're right, McClusky.

1182
01:30:33,745 --> 01:30:35,978
Bombing Six on me.

1183
01:30:53,045 --> 01:30:54,777
Think they've seen us?

1184
01:30:54,779 --> 01:30:57,245
When they see us, we'll know.

1185
01:31:13,812 --> 01:31:15,512
Brace for impact!

1186
01:32:26,581 --> 01:32:28,812
God damn it. That magnificent
son of a bitch

1187
01:32:28,814 --> 01:32:30,278
actually found them.

1188
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,745
<i>All right, boys.</i>

1189
01:32:31,747 --> 01:32:34,481
<i>Bombing Six, we've got
the first bastard in line.</i>

1190
01:32:58,381 --> 01:33:00,315
Mr. Best, watch out!

1191
01:33:04,415 --> 01:33:05,546
What the hell?

1192
01:33:05,548 --> 01:33:08,146
<i>McClusky was supposed
to go for the far carrier.</i>

1193
01:33:08,148 --> 01:33:09,348
Stay on me.

1194
01:33:29,582 --> 01:33:31,114
At 4,000.

1195
01:33:48,216 --> 01:33:49,447
3,000!

1196
01:33:49,449 --> 01:33:51,113
Do it, baby, come on!

1197
01:33:51,115 --> 01:33:52,115
Come on!

1198
01:33:58,182 --> 01:33:59,316
2,000!

1199
01:34:04,416 --> 01:34:06,182
1,800!

1200
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:51,748
Come on, Dickinson,
do what you're paid to do.

1201
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:04,515
Whoo!

1202
01:35:04,517 --> 01:35:07,181
Yeah!

1203
01:35:42,718 --> 01:35:45,349
<i>Feeling a little lonely, sir?</i>

1204
01:35:45,351 --> 01:35:47,449
Wish we'd brought
more planes to the party.

1205
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:50,115
<i>You always wanted
to be a hero, Kroeger.</i>

1206
01:35:50,117 --> 01:35:51,518
Now's your chance.

1207
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:25,550
Okay, Murray.

1208
01:36:25,552 --> 01:36:27,617
We put that carrier
out of action

1209
01:36:27,619 --> 01:36:29,586
even if we have to crash
on her deck.

1210
01:36:39,686 --> 01:36:40,686
4,000!

1211
01:36:58,587 --> 01:37:00,253
3,000!

1212
01:37:36,253 --> 01:37:37,253
1,800!

1213
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,454
1,600!

1214
01:37:46,354 --> 01:37:48,187
1,500!

1215
01:38:13,488 --> 01:38:15,419
That was a beauty, sir!

1216
01:38:15,421 --> 01:38:17,154
Right on her deck!

1217
01:38:34,555 --> 01:38:36,288
Any fighters on our tail?

1218
01:38:37,822 --> 01:38:39,153
No, sir.

1219
01:38:39,155 --> 01:38:40,455
They must be chasing
someone else.

1220
01:39:29,156 --> 01:39:30,189
We're going in!

1221
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:41,354
O'Flaherty and Gaido
are down, sir.

1222
01:39:41,356 --> 01:39:43,221
If you don't hit
them damn Zeros,

1223
01:39:43,223 --> 01:39:44,256
we're gonna be joining 'em.

1224
01:40:00,156 --> 01:40:01,323
Are you okay, sir?

1225
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:04,688
Radio our position.

1226
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:05,822
We gotta get a ship out here

1227
01:40:05,824 --> 01:40:07,524
to pick up Gaido
and O'Flaherty.

1228
01:41:27,091 --> 01:41:29,256
Do you want us
to contact Admiral Spruance?

1229
01:41:29,258 --> 01:41:31,525
No, he can't break
radio silence.

1230
01:41:34,225 --> 01:41:35,225
For me?

1231
01:41:39,758 --> 01:41:43,190
Rochefort intercepted
a Japanese signal.

1232
01:41:43,192 --> 01:41:46,123
He can't translate the body,
but look at the call sign.

1233
01:41:46,125 --> 01:41:47,457
That's from Admiral Nagumo.

1234
01:41:47,459 --> 01:41:49,057
But he's not transmitting
from the <i>Akagi.</i>

1235
01:41:49,059 --> 01:41:50,424
He's transmitting
from a cruiser.

1236
01:41:50,426 --> 01:41:52,559
Now, why the hell would
Nagumo leave his flagship?

1237
01:42:53,393 --> 01:42:55,058
They taught us
about dehydration

1238
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,126
in flight school.

1239
01:42:56,727 --> 01:42:58,625
Your skin starts to crack,

1240
01:42:58,627 --> 01:42:59,758
liver fails...

1241
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,091
Knock it off.

1242
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:03,126
What if nobody finds us?

1243
01:43:04,227 --> 01:43:05,393
We swim back to Pearl.

1244
01:43:07,193 --> 01:43:08,327
Good luck with sharks.

1245
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:10,694
We'll need something to eat.

1246
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,093
Wait. Wait, I see something.

1247
01:43:17,828 --> 01:43:19,793
Looks like a destroyer.

1248
01:43:19,795 --> 01:43:21,328
American or Jap?

1249
01:43:38,695 --> 01:43:41,759
You, tell us your ship,

1250
01:43:41,761 --> 01:43:43,628
or we throw you overboard.

1251
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:46,094
Cigarette?

1252
01:44:01,561 --> 01:44:04,161
You know, I had a lot
of friends at Pearl Harbor.

1253
01:44:06,696 --> 01:44:09,229
So how about
you go fuck yourself?

1254
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:26,828
Murray, get something to eat.

1255
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:29,127
I bet we're going back
out there.

1256
01:45:29,129 --> 01:45:31,163
We have to go upstairs
to report.

1257
01:45:31,697 --> 01:45:33,061
Hey, what happened?

1258
01:45:33,063 --> 01:45:34,761
I got strafed by a Zero.

1259
01:45:34,763 --> 01:45:37,761
Hey, how'd you know
to follow that Jap destroyer?

1260
01:45:37,763 --> 01:45:39,595
I played a hunch.

1261
01:45:39,597 --> 01:45:42,262
Well, your hunch might have
won us this battle.

1262
01:45:42,264 --> 01:45:44,529
But I gotta tell ya,

1263
01:45:44,531 --> 01:45:48,062
that looked like some
cowboy bullshit to me.

1264
01:45:48,064 --> 01:45:50,195
Well, if you can't beat 'em,
join 'em.

1265
01:45:51,498 --> 01:45:52,731
<i>Yorktown's</i> hit.

1266
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:55,462
What have we got left?

1267
01:45:55,464 --> 01:45:57,329
Couple of SBDs just returned.

1268
01:45:57,331 --> 01:45:58,729
The pilots are coming up
to report.

1269
01:46:00,664 --> 01:46:03,195
What's the news
from the enemy fleet?

1270
01:46:03,197 --> 01:46:05,062
Three carriers down.
One to go.

1271
01:46:05,064 --> 01:46:06,329
And our air group?

1272
01:46:06,331 --> 01:46:08,262
Only three torpedo bombers
came back,

1273
01:46:08,264 --> 01:46:09,462
and they're all shot up.

1274
01:46:09,464 --> 01:46:11,262
What about the dive bombers?

1275
01:46:11,264 --> 01:46:13,629
We can probably scrounge up
a dozen.

1276
01:46:13,631 --> 01:46:15,829
McClusky, you've been shot.

1277
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:18,095
- I can fly, sir.
- The hell you can.

1278
01:46:18,097 --> 01:46:19,564
Get your ass down to sick bay.

1279
01:46:22,631 --> 01:46:24,529
Put the pilots you trust

1280
01:46:24,531 --> 01:46:26,429
in any plane that can fly.

1281
01:46:26,431 --> 01:46:27,464
Yes, sir.

1282
01:46:31,599 --> 01:46:33,363
You okay, sir?

1283
01:46:33,365 --> 01:46:35,499
I'm fine.

1284
01:46:50,599 --> 01:46:52,632
Has anybody heard
from Dickinson?

1285
01:46:53,298 --> 01:46:54,663
No.

1286
01:46:54,665 --> 01:46:56,363
Not yet.

1287
01:46:56,365 --> 01:46:59,263
Look, I know you boys
have just been through hell.

1288
01:46:59,265 --> 01:47:01,499
But we gotta go back
and hit the last carrier.

1289
01:47:14,465 --> 01:47:16,232
I'll see
if I can find more men.

1290
01:47:34,066 --> 01:47:35,066
Hey.

1291
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:37,533
Strap up.

1292
01:47:38,666 --> 01:47:41,064
We're going back out.

1293
01:47:41,066 --> 01:47:42,164
I'm sorry, sir, but I think

1294
01:47:42,166 --> 01:47:44,531
you need to find
somebody else.

1295
01:47:44,533 --> 01:47:47,397
You don't know what it's like
to be in the back seat, sir.

1296
01:47:47,399 --> 01:47:49,333
You fly like you don't care
if we come home.

1297
01:48:01,333 --> 01:48:03,498
I wanna go home, too.

1298
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:06,400
I wanna spend more than a few
days at a time with my wife.

1299
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:09,267
See my little girl grow up.

1300
01:48:09,834 --> 01:48:11,167
And you're right.

1301
01:48:12,801 --> 01:48:14,765
If we go out there,

1302
01:48:14,767 --> 01:48:16,701
we probably
aren't coming back.

1303
01:48:17,601 --> 01:48:19,398
But this is our job,

1304
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,398
and we're the guys
who have to hold the fort

1305
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:23,067
till the cavalry arrives.

1306
01:48:26,801 --> 01:48:28,767
Look, if you really can't fly,

1307
01:48:29,701 --> 01:48:31,465
I'll find someone else.

1308
01:48:31,467 --> 01:48:34,599
But you should get back
in that plane.

1309
01:48:34,601 --> 01:48:37,699
You'll remember this moment
for the rest of your life.

1310
01:48:37,701 --> 01:48:39,599
And if you know
that you came through

1311
01:48:39,601 --> 01:48:41,532
when people
were counting on you,

1312
01:48:41,534 --> 01:48:43,367
you'll be able
to face anything.

1313
01:48:55,702 --> 01:48:57,502
We've come this far, Murray.

1314
01:48:58,768 --> 01:49:00,702
Don't make me go back
out there without you.

1315
01:49:14,301 --> 01:49:15,568
I'll warm her up, sir.

1316
01:50:13,669 --> 01:50:14,834
Get ready, Murray.

1317
01:50:14,836 --> 01:50:17,135
We're not sneaking up
on them this time.

1318
01:50:19,703 --> 01:50:21,336
Here they come!

1319
01:51:30,104 --> 01:51:31,336
Altitude.

1320
01:51:31,338 --> 01:51:33,171
We've got Zeroes on our tail.

1321
01:52:25,806 --> 01:52:27,005
This is for Pearl.

1322
01:53:10,373 --> 01:53:11,373
You're gonna be okay.

1323
01:53:13,673 --> 01:53:14,740
Thanks, boys.

1324
01:53:17,273 --> 01:53:18,505
What happened to you?

1325
01:53:18,507 --> 01:53:20,673
I ran out of fuel
about 20 miles out.

1326
01:53:21,807 --> 01:53:23,306
Ditched next to the Phelps.

1327
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,473
Where's Best?

1328
01:53:27,473 --> 01:53:29,039
That's one of his wingmen.

1329
01:53:29,773 --> 01:53:31,540
He hasn't come back yet.

1330
01:53:33,073 --> 01:53:35,740
He's probably just taking
a victory lap.

1331
01:53:40,574 --> 01:53:41,574
Yeah.

1332
01:53:45,307 --> 01:53:46,307
Hey.

1333
01:53:48,641 --> 01:53:50,239
Men like Dick Best
are the reason

1334
01:53:50,241 --> 01:53:51,341
we're gonna win this war.

1335
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:08,608
Come on, Best.

1336
01:54:20,307 --> 01:54:21,572
Any news?

1337
01:54:21,574 --> 01:54:22,839
The kids are out back.

1338
01:54:22,841 --> 01:54:24,040
Go, go.

1339
01:54:25,441 --> 01:54:26,441
Hi.

1340
01:54:28,308 --> 01:54:30,242
Cindy heard a rumor
from the base.

1341
01:54:31,075 --> 01:54:32,440
There's a big battle

1342
01:54:32,442 --> 01:54:34,640
and one of our carriers
is sinking.

1343
01:54:34,642 --> 01:54:36,573
And the pilots?

1344
01:54:36,575 --> 01:54:39,073
It sounds like we lost
a lot of them.

1345
01:54:39,075 --> 01:54:41,742
I am gonna go
powder my nose quickly.

1346
01:55:04,108 --> 01:55:07,106
The Japanese might charge
with their battleships.

1347
01:55:07,108 --> 01:55:10,106
So we will withdraw
for the night.

1348
01:55:10,108 --> 01:55:12,373
But their fleet might be
out of range in the morning.

1349
01:55:12,375 --> 01:55:14,640
Nimitz ordered us
to be judicious.

1350
01:55:14,642 --> 01:55:16,543
We won a great victory today.

1351
01:55:18,109 --> 01:55:19,376
Let's not blow it.

1352
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:01,076
God damn it! Dick Best!

1353
01:56:05,744 --> 01:56:07,342
Hang in there, kid.

1354
01:56:07,344 --> 01:56:08,644
We're almost home.

1355
01:56:26,444 --> 01:56:28,175
I thought you were dead.

1356
01:56:28,177 --> 01:56:29,777
Yeah. They said the same thing
about you.

1357
01:56:31,544 --> 01:56:32,644
I'm glad they were wrong.

1358
01:56:35,477 --> 01:56:37,141
Admiral's orders.

1359
01:56:37,143 --> 01:56:38,277
Give it to Murray.

1360
01:56:38,777 --> 01:56:39,777
He earned it.

1361
01:56:42,577 --> 01:56:44,143
Give me your hand.

1362
01:56:47,143 --> 01:56:48,310
You okay?

1363
01:56:51,677 --> 01:56:52,678
Yeah.

1364
01:56:53,745 --> 01:56:55,076
Corpsman!

1365
01:56:55,078 --> 01:56:56,445
I need a corpsman!

1366
01:57:00,578 --> 01:57:01,612
I got you.

1367
01:57:02,512 --> 01:57:03,512
Here we go.

1368
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,747
What happened to Bruno?

1369
01:58:46,847 --> 01:58:49,778
PBY flew over
his last known position.

1370
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:52,046
They spotted
an empty life raft.

1371
02:01:21,383 --> 02:01:22,650
The Japanese are retreating.

1372
02:01:34,116 --> 02:01:35,617
- We won.
- Yeah.

1373
02:02:15,317 --> 02:02:17,315
God bless those boys.

1374
02:02:17,317 --> 02:02:20,050
Turns out all they needed
was a fair fight.

1375
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:46,686
Half our men,

1376
02:03:47,853 --> 02:03:49,686
dead or missing.

1377
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:52,351
Yeah.

1378
02:03:52,353 --> 02:03:54,086
Hey, whatever happened
to that whiskey?

1379
02:03:55,386 --> 02:03:57,651
I was waiting for you
to sneak out of sick bay.

1380
02:04:20,454 --> 02:04:21,621
We did it.

1381
02:05:06,588 --> 02:05:07,588
Hang on, boys.

1382
02:05:13,121 --> 02:05:15,353
- Thanks.
- Of course.

1383
02:05:15,355 --> 02:05:16,686
Hey, Layton.

1384
02:05:16,688 --> 02:05:18,088
Hell of a job.

1385
02:05:21,755 --> 02:05:23,555
You boys really came through
for us.

1386
02:05:53,189 --> 02:05:54,189
There's Daddy!

1387
02:05:56,189 --> 02:05:57,189
Come on, baby.

1388
02:06:04,155 --> 02:06:05,656
- Hey!
- Daddy! Daddy!

1389
02:06:06,823 --> 02:06:08,422
Hey, sweetie.

1390
02:06:14,823 --> 02:06:16,422
Oh, thank God.

1391
02:06:17,356 --> 02:06:18,356
What happened?

1392
02:06:19,723 --> 02:06:22,654
Apparently,
I inhaled caustic soda.

1393
02:06:22,656 --> 02:06:23,821
What does that mean?

1394
02:06:23,823 --> 02:06:25,220
My lungs are shot.

1395
02:06:25,222 --> 02:06:28,121
The Navy's never gonna
let me fly again.

1396
02:06:28,123 --> 02:06:29,755
Well, get good
at something else.

1397
02:06:29,757 --> 02:06:32,423
You have the rest of your life
to figure it out.

1398
02:06:33,357 --> 02:06:34,423
Oh.

1399
02:07:11,148 --> 02:07:16,148
