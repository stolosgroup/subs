2
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,381
Vorsicht!

3
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:35,208
Rohr eins und zwei. Klar machen.

4
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:36,908
Rohr eins.

5
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:38,712
Klar machen.

6
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:43,017
- Rohr eins.
- Los.

7
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:44,615
- Los.
- Los.

8
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:15,484
Right on time.

9
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:18,490
Yes, a bit out of the way.
I hope we don't miss the news.

10
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:20,287
No, you won't miss the news.

11
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:21,223
Right.

12
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:26,991
For God's sake, slow down, Bill!
You're a maniac!

13
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,599
We're late.

14
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:29,693
To hell with that!

15
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:33,398
I'm only having a drink.
I'd like to be alive to enjoy it.

16
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:03,465
Hello, Bill.

17
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,768
Gentlemen, I want you to know that our
commanding officer just tried to kill me.

18
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:13,705
- Man's a maniac!
- Shut up!

19
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,780
Here's the news with Alvar Liddell.

20
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:18,175
An official announcement
from Washington...

21
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:20,082
You'd think we could afford a new radio!

22
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,678
... shows the Americans landed
in Algiers and Oran...

23
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,087
... on the Mediterranean coast
of French North Africa.

24
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,387
Hitler said he'd be in Cairo by Christmas.

25
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,291
That'll take the pressure off back home.

26
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:31,297
They've promised a second front
long enough.

27
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,696
American landings were carried out
in the night...

28
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,995
... made with British naval and air support.

29
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:40,839
Many divisions of the British Army
are on their way to reinforce them.

30
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:44,206
The Supreme Commander
is General Eisenhower.

31
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:46,906
Ike'll soon sort that lot out.

32
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:02,451
Your drink, sir.

33
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:19,374
Lewis, I didn't see you there.

34
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,777
Haven't seen you for weeks.
Where've you been?

35
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:24,283
Here and there.
Another hush-hush scheme...

36
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:27,712
...attempting to produce petrol
from cow manure.

37
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:29,116
Sound promising?

38
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:31,316
We get our best results from sacred cows.

39
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,619
How are things at SOE?

40
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:37,092
Splendid. Nearly every night
an electrifying bridge game.

41
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,728
Good old top-secret Colonel Pugh.

42
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,591
You're lucky you're in uniform.

43
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:45,332
I'm just a bloody tea planter.
What's tea got to do with the war?

44
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:47,705
I'm told it's good for morale.

45
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:52,235
SOE: Special Operations Executive.
What the devil do you chaps do?

46
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:54,206
Odd jobs.

47
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:55,538
Come on.

48
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:58,013
All right. Unusual operations.

49
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:01,444
You sound like a ruddy abortionist.

50
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,055
Not a bad description.

51
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:08,352
I see you're having lunch, so I'll
trot along. God bless. See you soon.

52
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:09,191
I hope so.

53
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:13,562
Thanks for the drink, Bill.
Don't offer me another lift, ever.

54
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:17,161
- Red, don't you owe me a drink?
- What was that about?

55
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, I scared the hell out of him
by driving too fast.

56
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:23,472
My own frustration, I suppose.
I'm just as envious of you as he is.

57
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,970
Being the managing director
of a chemical plant is not my idea...

58
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,275
...of a glorious contribution to the war.

59
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:30,881
What do you want me to say?

60
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:32,884
You're classified essential where you are.

61
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:36,581
If you want to consider me lucky
to be doing what I'm doing, go ahead.

62
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,782
What happened to your wife
and daughter in Coventry...

63
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:40,985
Come off it, Bill.

64
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:44,195
I'm sorry, Lewis. I didn't mean
to open up old wounds...

65
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:47,232
...but you do have some opportunity
for revenge.

66
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,794
Oh, good God. If I have to kill
some poor devils, it's not revenge.

67
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,838
It doesn't really diminish my anger
or my grief. Not one bit.

68
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,840
Now, what do you say we try
to have a pleasant lunch?

69
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:03,941
I'm sorry, Lewis.

70
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:07,044
- How's Doris?
- She's fine. She's fine.

71
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:11,385
Lewis, if you should ever hear of a job
that's so odd...

72
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:14,459
...that nobody else would want
to get involved in it...

73
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:17,258
...do think of the Calcutta Light Horse.

74
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,164
It's not very likely.

75
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:23,894
No, I know. We're all civilians these days
and a little thin on top...

76
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,302
...and thick in the middle,
but I guarantee...

77
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,898
...each of those fellows would pull
his own weight.

78
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:31,368
That's not an intentional joke.

79
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,878
You will remember it, won't you?
Just in case.

80
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:37,774
I shan't forget.

81
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,941
- Morning, Corporal.
- Morning, sir.

82
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,860
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

83
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,953
Colonel Pugh and Captain Stewart
are here.

84
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:26,362
Thank you.

85
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,768
- Lewis, how did things go in Calcutta?
- All set, sir.

86
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,772
By tomorrow night Force 136 should be
behind Japanese lines in Burma...

87
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,771
...blowing up various little items.

88
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,973
Good. All right, let's get down
to the new business.

89
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:43,983
I see you've been studying
the Admiralty's urgent request.

90
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:47,180
Astonishing. Forty-six freighters sunk
by German submarines...

91
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,517
...in the Indian Ocean in the past month.

92
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:52,990
The U-boats know exactly where
and when to strike.

93
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:56,627
Incredibly accurate information,
etcetera, etcetera.

94
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:01,232
Radio Monitoring finally managed
to home in on a powerful transmitter...

95
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,633
...400 miles south of Bombay
just last night.

96
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,265
What do you suppose
took them so long, sir?

97
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:08,135
Ours not to reason why.

98
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:11,038
Well, here we go Gavin.
Off to blow up a transmitter.

99
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:14,845
Not exactly. The bloody thing's not
in India proper.

100
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,549
It's in Goa, dammit.
Somewhere in the Mormugoa Harbour.

101
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:21,142
Neutral territory. Portuguese colony.

102
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,254
- That's a bit tricky.
- Naturally.

103
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:29,059
Also, our people aren't able
to break the code.

104
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:32,861
If Radio Monitoring are right,
and the transmitter is actually...

105
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,957
...in the harbor, it must be on a ship.

106
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:39,698
You don't suppose it's on one of the three
German freighters interned there?

107
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:42,468
The Portuguese authorities dismantled
the ships' radios...

108
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:44,568
...when they gave them permission to stay.

109
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:48,911
How do we know one of them doesn't have
another transmitter hidden somewhere?

110
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:51,678
We don't. Here we are
with the strictest orders...

111
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:54,014
...never to violate Portugal's neutrality.

112
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:56,078
What do you suggest we do about it, sir?

113
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:58,282
We can sit here and froth at the mouth...

114
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:02,327
...or find out where the information
to those U-boats originates.

115
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,923
I suggest that Gavin and I
spend a day or two in Goa...

116
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:08,797
...poking about to see
what we can dig up.

117
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:10,394
Dig up, or pick up?

118
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:13,995
- Oh, he speaks for himself, sir.
- I speak for myself.

119
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,406
Yes, well I was speaking for you.

120
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:23,505
Yes, all right, I suppose this is
top priority. Go ahead and dig.

121
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:52,572
Der Kapitan.

122
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:04,386
Well, that's the three of them.

123
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:08,888
Yes, but which has the transmitter?

124
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:46,831
There's our old friend.

125
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:52,036
Gentlemen, a great pleasure
to see you again.

126
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,067
Manuel.

127
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:55,932
Please.

128
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:00,778
How's the heart, Manuel?

129
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:02,709
My heart... I never...

130
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:05,814
- You joke with me.
- Not exactly.

131
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,284
Sit down, Manuel.

132
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,417
You look like your feet hurt.

133
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:14,783
The Germans outside,
which ship are they from?

134
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:15,894
The Ehrenfels.

135
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:18,520
- Captain Rofer.
- A very charming gentleman, actually.

136
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:22,094
No doubt. Well, what's been happening?

137
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:25,232
- Nothing, just the usual.
- The usual what?

138
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:27,600
People coming and going,
eating and drinking.

139
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,205
Everything normal.

140
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,005
How's the... gambling, Manuel?

141
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:36,512
A little slow. Naturally, the police
keep asking for more and more.

142
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:39,616
That's too bad. Let's get to the point.

143
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:43,144
My friend here has a nice fat packet
of escudos to lose...

144
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:44,415
...on your wheel.

145
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:47,220
- Personally, I would wish for him to win.
- Manuel!

146
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:52,362
How much are we talking about?

147
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:58,734
All of it. And then I commit suicide
right on your doorstep.

148
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:04,075
By the same token, I could give it
to you here, right now.

149
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:05,474
No. No, Senhor, no.

150
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,376
Maybe it'd be more fun to lose it
bit by bit. What do you think?

151
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,781
- Yes, Senhor.
- Meanwhile, you and I will have...

152
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:15,413
...a pleasant little chat
in your private office.

153
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:19,491
Please.

154
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,500
I'll be one minute.

155
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,511
Rien ne va plus.
No more bets, ladies and gentlemen.

156
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:08,271
Thank you.

157
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:13,275
Faites vosjeux, messieurs dames.
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.

158
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:17,477
- Rien ne va plus. No more bets.
- Good luck.

159
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,416
- It's bad luck to say that.
- Oh, instantly retracted.

160
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:24,515
Trente-quatre. Rouge. Pair et passe.

161
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:26,285
Thirty-four. Red and even.

162
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,821
It must have been the instant retraction.

163
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:31,520
Or maybe it was the good luck
to begin with.

164
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:33,595
Or how about plain destiny?

165
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,292
- Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.
- I'll think I'll try that again.

166
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:39,095
Good luck.

167
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:41,403
No more bets.

168
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:42,499
I hope so.

169
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,409
How about celebrating my impending loss
with a bottle of champagne?

170
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,708
Thank you, I don't drink when I gamble.

171
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:51,842
Smoke?

172
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:54,813
- Tap dance?
- Not recently.

173
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:56,545
How about tea in the lounge?

174
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:59,113
You do hear those little clicking sounds?

175
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:02,353
Trente et un. Noir et impasse.

176
00:15:02,562 --> 00:15:04,792
Thirty-one. Black and odd.

177
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:07,856
By the way, my name is Gavin Stewart.

178
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:11,060
I take it that is a wedding ring?

179
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,603
That's what it is.

180
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:15,072
- And you are Mrs...?
- Cromwell.

181
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,207
Let me hazard a guess, Mrs. Cromwell.

182
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:21,175
You are here in Goa on holiday...

183
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:24,115
...and your husband is a large gentleman
probably sitting...

184
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:25,582
...at the baccarat table.

185
00:15:25,618 --> 00:15:28,280
No, I live here and my husband is dead.

186
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:32,720
- Oh, I'm sorry. I tend to be...
- Over charming?

187
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:35,120
I really am sorry.

188
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:37,322
There's no need to be.

189
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:39,492
Let's watch our money disappear.

190
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:41,500
Rien ne va plus. No more bets.

191
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:45,301
Manuel, you're not thinking hard enough.

192
00:15:45,705 --> 00:15:47,900
- I'm doing my best.
- Well, let's try again.

193
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,501
We're talking about Indians
who visit your outdoor cafe frequently.

194
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:54,709
Yes, quite a few. I said so.
It's a very popular place.

195
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:59,012
And we're talking about someone else.
Probably a German who might...

196
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:02,251
...just pass by at the same time every day.

197
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:06,953
- It's not something l...
- Or who might drop in for a few minutes.

198
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:10,961
Or who might be followed down the street
by one of the Indians.

199
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:14,756
Look, I'd really like to help you,
but I don't notice these things.

200
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,858
I'm too busy in the place.

201
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,098
Manuel...

202
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:20,866
...listen.

203
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:24,067
Whatever you pay the police to let you
keep the gambling going...

204
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,102
...I can double it to have them
shut you down.

205
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,471
So, take a bit of friendly advice.

206
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:32,576
I want you to notice these things.

207
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:36,922
Faites vosjeux, messieurs dames.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

208
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:43,084
- Faites vosjeux, messieurs dames.
- You have faith.

209
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:44,924
'''Hope''' would be a better word.

210
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,099
Would you mind if I ask
what you're doing in Goa?

211
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:51,103
Losing. But with incredible grace.

212
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:54,035
Actually I'm here on business
just for the day.

213
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:56,336
I have to be back in Bombay
tomorrow night.

214
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:59,404
I may sound quaint, but I sell tea.

215
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:05,950
Vingt-deux. Noir. Pair et passe.
Twenty-two. Black and even.

216
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:07,551
Well, that does it.

217
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,751
You've lost quite a lot. I'm sorry.

218
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,882
The way I look at it, I won.

219
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:13,782
I met you...

220
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:15,952
...and I'd like to meet you again.

221
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:17,290
Perhaps you will...

222
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:19,058
...on your next trip.

223
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:20,957
I'll be here.

224
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:36,512
Faites vosjeux.
Place your bets ladies and gentlemen.

225
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,577
Senhor, I'm very frightened.

226
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,912
Manuel, I promised you that no one
will ever know you've said anything at all.

227
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:45,588
You don't even know their names.

228
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:49,593
All you know is that an Indian with a mole
on his cheek and a tall European...

229
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,323
...may be communicating with each other.

230
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:56,300
- Or they may not.
- Exactly. Lewis, we've a long drive.

231
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:57,996
Senhor. The gambling...?

232
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:01,629
Strictly between you and the police.

233
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,941
Mrs. Cromwell. May I be
of some assistance?

234
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:14,051
Manuel, I've been really lucky.
I'm taking home a lot of your money.

235
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,544
I'm so happy for you. Congratulations.

236
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:21,788
Well, you probably know I'll come back and
lose it all, but just now I feel marvelous.

237
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,658
Manuel, I'd like to give you
a little something.

238
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:27,666
- No, I couldn't accept.
- Why not?

239
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,167
Of course you could.

240
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:31,396
But I never tip you when you lose.

241
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:32,760
Manuel.

242
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:34,762
I insist!

243
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:38,710
Look, dammit! We've got to get rid
of that transmitter!

244
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:41,279
Do you know how many lives depend
on supplies lying...

245
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:42,871
...at the bottom of the Indian Ocean?

246
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,783
I think we do, sir. But we still don't know
exactly where it is.

247
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:50,219
I think our first priority is to find
whoever heads the spy ring.

248
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:53,419
How will you handle that?
Your lead in Goa...

249
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,820
...is rather fragile.

250
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:59,227
I'm not so sure. We know that the man
who gave it to us was murdered.

251
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:00,927
It's worth following up.

252
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:04,163
And just suppose you discover
who the head spy is. Then what?

253
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,533
Gavin and I kidnap him
and interrogate him rather thoroughly.

254
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,033
- In Goa?
- Right, if that's where he is.

255
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:13,543
Granted, there's a risk of being caught
in neutral territory.

256
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:15,546
We can always plead insanity, sir.

257
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:17,548
He speaks for himself.

258
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:21,882
Then do it, but it dislikes me.
If you two are caught...

259
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,582
...God knows what trouble we'll be in.

260
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:29,157
- Yes, all right. Go ahead and make plans.
- Thank you, sir.

261
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,157
- Watch it, Gavin.
- Why not?

262
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:45,567
Helen, get me 641 in Goa.

263
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,394
Compliments of the management.

264
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:14,005
That's what I call Portuguese hospitality.

265
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,903
Thank you very much.

266
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:18,401
Thank you. Welcome to Goa.

267
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:20,442
Thank you.

268
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:27,249
That was fast.

269
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,818
The truth is, Mackenzie has a telephone
built into his wooden leg.

270
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:32,948
What does it say?

271
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:36,858
'''Possible your man is Ram das Gupta.
Indian. About 32.

272
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:42,829
'''Large mole on right cheek.

197 Cabral Street, Goa.

274
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,137
'''Known political activist
for Indian independence.'''

275
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,868
I think we should meet this fellow.

276
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:58,946
That means right now.

277
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:03,878
Hurry up, children, you'll be late
for school.

278
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,719
Bom dia.

279
00:21:58,344 --> 00:22:00,676
- May I use your telephone?
- Sim, Senhor.

280
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,076
Thank you.

281
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:10,177
Ishla.

282
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,780
- Three, two, nine.
- Yes, sir.

283
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:19,130
He'll be calling me back.

284
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:25,535
Yes?

285
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:26,600
Who?

286
00:22:27,406 --> 00:22:28,600
Oh, damn.

287
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,235
Is there someone here named
Ram das Gupta?

288
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,507
This call is for a Mr. Ram das Gupta.
Perhaps he's outside.

289
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,514
- Senhor Ram das Gupta?
- Yes?

290
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,119
Telephone.

291
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,499
I'm sure you'd like to go to the toilet.

292
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:11,576
Now, listen very carefully.
Your name is Ram das Gupta.

293
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:15,710
You live at 197 Cabral Street.
You work at Inter-Europe Shipping.

294
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:19,090
Unless you fully cooperate,
we'll be delighted to kill you.

295
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,283
Is that understood?

296
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:24,292
Listen to this: '''The Ennismore Trader.
6,212 tons.

and 21.00 hours.''

300
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:38,533
That's one we've saved.

301
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,545
You are a naughty boy.
Now we'd like you to go back...

302
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:44,615
...to your table and continue
with your usual routine.

303
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,347
We'll be watching. The tiniest false move
and you're dead.

in Southern Asia.

306
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,209
Are you sure?

307
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:57,650
I'm sure.

308
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:38,886
Stay here, I'll be back.

309
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:48,002
Senhor.

310
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,663
Did that strong coffee upset your stomach?

311
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:17,563
- No.
- Pity.

312
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:25,503
If you don't keep your mouth shut,
our next meeting may not be this friendly.

00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:31,305
Mrs. Cromwell!

314
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,910
Hello... or words to that effect.

315
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,381
Hello.

316
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,183
What a coincidence. I've been sitting
over there waiting for you.

317
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,218
No, you haven't.

318
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:49,800
I cannot tell a lie. To tell you the truth,
I'm waiting for a business associate...

319
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:51,826
...who's never been on time in his life.

320
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:23,766
- By the way, it's Gavin.
- I remember.

321
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:28,703
Do I still call you Mrs. Cromwell?

322
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:31,970
No, wait! Don't answer that.
What's your dog's name?

323
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:34,302
- You won't laugh?
- Guaranteed.

324
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:36,908
Hamlet.

325
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,612
But he's not a Great Dane.

326
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:44,281
He doesn't know that.
And you may not believe this...

327
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,983
...but they named me Agnes.

328
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:52,090
I'm still not laughing, Agnes.

329
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:55,122
There I was, a helpless infant...
Coffee, please.

330
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:57,702
- A human arm for the dog, please.
- Pardon, Senhor?

331
00:27:57,736 --> 00:28:01,536
Just the coffee. You were saying?
A helpless infant...

332
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:05,833
May I say how spectacularly
you have matured?

333
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:11,041
But first, is it all right if I continue
to call you Mrs. Cromwell?

334
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,346
That's the best idea I've heard all day.

335
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,286
It's still early, Mrs. Cromwell.

336
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:54,191
I really must leave.
The beast needs exercise.

337
00:28:54,393 --> 00:28:57,419
Don't forget, we still have that date.

338
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:02,663
Thanks for the coffee.

339
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:05,368
Have a lovely walk, Mrs. Cromwell.

340
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,636
- Fast work.
- Well, man does not live by bread alone.

341
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:17,143
A man who loves dogs can't be all bad.

342
00:29:18,183 --> 00:29:20,777
Come along, I have some news for you.

343
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:28,558
There, those two men.

344
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,458
We pay the bill and then wait
outside Trompeta's house.

345
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,689
Right.

346
00:29:33,165 --> 00:29:35,599
We could wait there all day and night, too.

347
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:38,067
Won't the car look a trifle conspicuous?

348
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:42,573
I suppose it might, but we can't
just break into his house and take him.

349
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:47,167
We could, except we don't know
who else might be there.

350
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,372
I don't like the idea
of Gupta running about loose.

351
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,907
I mean, he knows we're not in tea.

352
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:01,322
All right...

353
00:30:02,194 --> 00:30:04,389
...we'll pick up Mr. Trompeta
in the morning.

354
00:30:06,832 --> 00:30:11,633
Well, in that event, Lewis,
I have a small favor to ask.

355
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:16,800
There's no need to look at me like that.

356
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,842
You know my country comes first.

357
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,936
You'd like me to take a long,
invigorating walk tonight.

358
00:30:22,013 --> 00:30:24,004
You could sit in the bar.

359
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,611
The walk will do me more good.

360
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:54,541
Excuse me, Senhor,
do you have a light for my cigarette?

361
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:46,817
Put your hands on your head.

362
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,230
You're a bloody fool.

363
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,625
You shoot me,
your life's not worth a rupee.

364
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:57,664
Nevertheless, I will also shoot the lady.

365
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,778
You killed him.

366
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:22,091
Yes, he was about to kill me and you.

367
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:25,685
That sort of thing tends
to make me impulsive.

368
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:27,589
Did you know him?

369
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,625
No.

370
00:33:33,939 --> 00:33:35,998
It was a nice throw. Thank you.

371
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:09,571
Good God! Who's that?

372
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,775
Well, it's a little complicated.

373
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,375
Where did you get the pistol?

374
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,380
From him.

375
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:22,576
That is just perfect.

376
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:26,318
We have an appointment tomorrow
with the Imperial Tea Company...

377
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:28,719
...not with the bloody police.

378
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,790
What was I supposed to do, Lewis?
Let him kill us?

379
00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:36,192
As you've probably gathered,
this is my boss.

380
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:37,791
How do you do?

381
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:42,700
A little civility wouldn't be out of place,
would it? I mean, it wasn't her fault.

382
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,836
I want to go now.

383
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:47,308
- I'll take you.
- No, thanks.

384
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:50,711
I didn't mean to sound rude.
You must be very upset.

385
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:53,143
Upset?

386
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:58,149
Why would I be upset?
I mean, it was just a simple murder.

387
00:34:59,457 --> 00:35:02,051
I promise you, you won't be involved
with the police.

388
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,792
That is, unless you wish
to involve yourself.

389
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:09,758
In Goa? That's all I need.
No, this is strictly your problem.

390
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:13,430
If it comes to it, I'll deny I was here.

391
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:14,904
As you wish.

392
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:19,165
Goodnight.

393
00:35:25,984 --> 00:35:27,781
Did you really have to kill him?

394
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:31,949
We could have worked on him and perhaps
learned something about Trompeta.

395
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,389
Honestly, Lewis, I really had no choice.
What happened to you?

396
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:38,960
Two very pleasant chaps tried to kill me
at the dock.

397
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:43,131
Did they? Maybe we should have
both sat in the bar.

398
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:44,634
Where are they now?

399
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,695
They're resting.

400
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:50,106
What do we do with him?

401
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:53,610
As Mackenzie said,
'''When in trouble, call room service.'''

402
00:35:57,549 --> 00:35:59,016
Bis heute nachmittag.

403
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:02,280
Sehr gut. Ich bereite alles vor
wie versprochen.

404
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:09,784
Could I trouble you for a match?

405
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,258
I don't smoke.

406
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:13,796
Would you please look
at the white car over there?

407
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:16,059
I think you might find it interesting.

408
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:20,666
If he has to kill you here and now, he will.

409
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:23,797
Let's you and I get into the car
very quietly.

410
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,396
Just relax, sit back. That's a good boy.

411
00:37:01,045 --> 00:37:03,343
Help! They're kidnapping me...

412
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:04,643
...help!

413
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,014
Dammit!

414
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:45,881
There's no longer much point...

415
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,117
...in delivering him to Intelligence.

416
00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:49,887
- Let's dump him here.
- No.

417
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:53,987
Wait till we've crossed the border.
We can't have him found in Goa.

418
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:46,177
A vossa identificacao, se faz favor?

419
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:48,315
Your papers, gentlemen?

420
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,316
Yes, of course.

421
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,888
Turned out nice again, hasn't it?

422
00:38:54,392 --> 00:38:55,518
Thank you.

423
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:06,132
And that gentleman?

424
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:09,463
Here it is. I'm sure you'll find
everything in order.

425
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:15,239
Perfectly, sir. Have a good trip, gentlemen.

426
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:32,451
You got away with killing Trompeta
and a fat lot of good it did us.

427
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:35,460
We did find out the transmitter's
on the Ehrenfels.

428
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:36,760
I understand your feelings.

429
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:40,302
No you don't. You took one hell of a risk
for next to nothing.

430
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:43,369
Whoever Trompeta's No. 2 man is
took over immediately.

431
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:45,806
We still haven't been able
to break the code.

432
00:39:45,877 --> 00:39:48,277
While you were on the train back to Delhi...

433
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:52,181
...three more ships have been sunk.
Did you hear what I said?

434
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:56,314
Three more ships have been sunk.
I'd like to go into that harbor...

435
00:39:56,387 --> 00:39:58,378
...with commandoes and blow the place up.

436
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:01,287
But we can't, which is rather frustrating.

437
00:40:02,593 --> 00:40:06,791
I've got no suggestions, which may
account for my unpleasant disposition.

438
00:40:11,402 --> 00:40:15,600
If the professionals can't do it,
we might have to turn to amateurs.

439
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:18,298
And what does that mean?

440
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:22,109
What if a group of British civilians
managed to board the Ehrenfels?

441
00:40:22,313 --> 00:40:26,010
If they were caught, it might be taken
as a drunken escapade.

442
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:30,214
You know, businessmen on holiday in Goa
without their wives...

443
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:35,120
...having a smashing good time. A little
chancy with the Portuguese government.

444
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:38,660
That's a masterpiece of understatement.
London would have our heads.

445
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,155
It might just succeed, sir.

446
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:46,236
And which civilians did you have in mind?

447
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:48,635
The Calcutta Light Horse, sir.

448
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:52,835
- The what?
- It's a part-time territorial unit.

449
00:40:52,944 --> 00:40:55,640
They haven't seen action for 40 years.

450
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:59,444
Lewis, you're talking about a mixed bag
of boozing, middle-aged...

451
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,279
...pot-bellied businessmen.

452
00:41:01,386 --> 00:41:04,981
No argument, but when the war started
every man Jack of them...

453
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:07,089
...volunteered for active service.

454
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:10,285
Those not accepted for whatever reasons
are all ex-soldiers.

455
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:15,295
They know weapons, they know tactics.
They'd give their right arms to help.

456
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,694
It's insane, Lewis, and you know it.

457
00:41:36,154 --> 00:41:38,122
Put together a plan and let's see it.

458
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:41,447
Thank you, sir.

459
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,237
Well done!

460
00:42:01,879 --> 00:42:03,972
- Have you seen Bill?
- No.

461
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:05,615
Probably in the bar.

462
00:42:11,689 --> 00:42:15,090
Obviously everything we've told you,
the operation, the destination...

463
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:17,491
...all of it is for your ears only.

464
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:19,524
Do you expect my men to volunteer...

465
00:42:19,597 --> 00:42:21,895
...without any idea of what for?

466
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:23,230
- Right.
- I thought so.

467
00:42:23,634 --> 00:42:27,627
All that the men must know
is that it couldn't be more important.

468
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:31,099
It'll be quite risky and it's top-secret.

469
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,105
Unfortunately, there'll be no pay in it,
no pensions if anyone's killed...

470
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:38,409
...or wounded, and no credit.

471
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:42,149
It all sounds unbelievably attractive to me.

472
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,518
I take it, no medals if all goes well?

473
00:42:44,622 --> 00:42:47,250
No medals. No recognition at all.

474
00:42:49,327 --> 00:42:50,521
I love it...

475
00:42:50,628 --> 00:42:52,118
...and so will they.

476
00:42:57,235 --> 00:42:59,795
- Melborne again.
- Bit early for casualties, isn't it?

477
00:43:01,072 --> 00:43:02,767
He'll be all right.

478
00:43:02,974 --> 00:43:05,772
- You okay, Dicky?
- Damn fool!

479
00:43:06,077 --> 00:43:07,669
Are you all right?

480
00:43:07,812 --> 00:43:11,304
Yes, I think so. Just knocked
all the wind out of me.

481
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:14,315
Well, there's enough of it in there,
Dicky lad.

482
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:17,616
- That's tremendously amusing.
- Must be a relief to your pony.

483
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:19,316
Robin, old chap...

484
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:22,982
...once I've adjusted my truss,
I'll be happy to thump you on the head.

485
00:43:23,094 --> 00:43:26,586
Come on, Dicky, just a bit of fun
in a cold, cruel world.

486
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,911
I've told you everything about
this operation that I'm allowed to.

487
00:44:19,383 --> 00:44:23,979
The Light Horse has not been in action
as a unit since the Boer War in 1900.

488
00:44:25,223 --> 00:44:28,624
But I hope and believe
that we soon will be.

489
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:34,498
I'm calling for between
15 and 20 volunteers.

490
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:36,089
One here, sir.

491
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:41,896
I was afraid of that. Thank you, gentlemen.
I appreciate it.

492
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,732
Now, those of you who are selected
will leave in about seven days.

493
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,105
You'll be gone for two weeks.

494
00:44:48,212 --> 00:44:50,908
It's best to tell your wives
you're ordered to Ranchi...

495
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:55,107
...for a two-week training period
of local defence, that sort of thing.

496
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:58,713
So, now will you all please give
your names and telephone numbers to...

497
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:00,450
...Sandy Lumsdaine.

498
00:45:11,102 --> 00:45:12,592
Here we go.

499
00:45:28,786 --> 00:45:30,117
Sorry, Jack.

500
00:45:30,388 --> 00:45:32,982
- Bill, I'm going on...
- We'll talk about it later.

501
00:45:35,926 --> 00:45:37,826
God bless us, everyone.

502
00:45:38,696 --> 00:45:40,891
Or help us. Take your choice.

503
00:46:12,863 --> 00:46:16,196
Move that game further down the beach
if you don't mind.

504
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:20,467
It starts off like a Hungarian omelet.
First steal one egg.

505
00:46:20,504 --> 00:46:22,768
We're actually stealing an entire ship.

506
00:46:22,873 --> 00:46:26,365
We can't rent one and naturally
the Navy has nothing available.

507
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:29,570
Then I have to sail the bloody thing
the whole way round India...

508
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:31,706
...from Calcutta to Cochin.

509
00:46:33,217 --> 00:46:36,084
Yes, you're the only one of us
with any experience at sea.

510
00:46:36,187 --> 00:46:40,385
And all I get is five Light Horse for crew,
plus three hired lascars.

511
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:43,225
We are not stealing the Queen Mary.

512
00:46:43,394 --> 00:46:46,693
We're not exactly looking
for a rowboat either.

513
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,692
Charlie Wilton knows engines
and I can navigate.

514
00:46:54,205 --> 00:46:55,797
Well, suppose we make it.

515
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,809
Then you bring the others
across by train to Cochin...

516
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:00,843
...I pick you up and we sail...

517
00:47:00,878 --> 00:47:04,336
...right in to Mormugoa Harbour
and blow up everything in sight.

518
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:05,280
Just like that.

519
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:08,043
Right. Nothing to it.
For a grand finale, we escape.

520
00:47:09,387 --> 00:47:11,753
Twenty of us against maybe 120 of them.

521
00:47:11,856 --> 00:47:14,757
There won't be 120 of them.
Gavin will see to that.

522
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:17,953
He'll be in Goa arranging
all sorts of brilliant diversions.

523
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:22,359
Come in. I think it's Jack.
He wants to see me.

524
00:47:24,568 --> 00:47:28,470
- Come in, Jack, take a seat.
- No thanks, sir, I'll stand.

525
00:47:28,773 --> 00:47:30,104
Forget the '''sir.'''

526
00:47:30,174 --> 00:47:34,201
I can't make a speech, but this is
the only chance I'll have...

527
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:37,306
...to settle accounts for my boy.

528
00:47:37,882 --> 00:47:39,179
Your boy?

529
00:47:39,216 --> 00:47:40,615
He was killed in Burma.

530
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:43,116
I didn't know. Sorry.

531
00:47:45,823 --> 00:47:48,485
Well, that's really what I came about.

532
00:47:49,126 --> 00:47:52,892
God knows, I know how you feel,
but you must realize...

533
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,397
I don't think you do at all.

534
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:58,400
But you don't understand the operation.
I don't know how to say this, but...

535
00:47:59,303 --> 00:48:01,771
We just can't risk your old ticker.

536
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,364
There's nothing wrong with it.
I have my pills.

537
00:48:04,442 --> 00:48:05,932
I'll take him.

538
00:48:06,744 --> 00:48:08,644
No liability at all.

539
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,243
I do have some strange deals to make
and I'm sure he'll handle some of them...

540
00:48:13,384 --> 00:48:15,181
...better than I can.

541
00:48:15,786 --> 00:48:17,151
Well, Bill?

542
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:22,991
All right, Jack. It's all yours.

543
00:48:46,183 --> 00:48:47,480
God, I'm dying.

544
00:48:47,585 --> 00:48:48,916
Hell, I'm dead.

545
00:48:48,986 --> 00:48:50,578
I've been dead nearly 20 minutes.

546
00:48:50,688 --> 00:48:52,883
I thought I smelled something strange.

547
00:49:05,669 --> 00:49:07,728
Good God, what are you doing?

548
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:09,032
Just toning up.

549
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:10,734
What on earth for?

550
00:49:10,975 --> 00:49:12,067
My health.

551
00:49:12,142 --> 00:49:15,236
Well, mind your hernia, dear.

552
00:49:20,851 --> 00:49:25,049
Why the hell don't you whistle
or something before you come out here?

553
00:49:30,861 --> 00:49:32,158
Mr. Melborne!

554
00:49:32,296 --> 00:49:33,388
Are you all right?

555
00:49:33,497 --> 00:49:37,058
No. I'm just having a private heart attack.

556
00:49:37,668 --> 00:49:39,067
Get out, Miss Wentworth!

557
00:49:41,372 --> 00:49:42,566
Come in.

558
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:48,206
Lewis! Delightful to see you.

559
00:49:48,712 --> 00:49:51,408
Is that Gavin? By george, it is Gavin.

560
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:55,278
If you mean the one with blood
rushing to his feet, you're right.

561
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:58,579
- Glad to see you back in one piece.
- It was a lovely mission.

562
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:02,324
There are some parts of Burma
that won't be the same again.

563
00:50:02,493 --> 00:50:05,291
Anything new coming up for Force 136, sir?

564
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:07,023
No, just for you.

565
00:50:07,831 --> 00:50:10,299
Marvelous. What can I do for you?

566
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:14,331
How would you like to blow up two
or three enemy ships in a neutral harbour?

567
00:50:14,605 --> 00:50:17,039
Delighted. Give me a couple days' notice...

568
00:50:17,107 --> 00:50:18,335
...to get my gear ready.

569
00:50:18,609 --> 00:50:22,101
It'll be in and out fast. There'll be
no second chance at these targets.

570
00:50:22,212 --> 00:50:24,043
I haven't needed one yet, have I?

571
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:27,614
The one thing I can't abide
is a lack of confidence.

572
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:30,912
- We'll be in touch, then.
- Fine. Onward and upward.

573
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,455
Anything new in the papers, Yogi?

574
00:50:33,824 --> 00:50:36,019
Yes, the world's upside down.

575
00:50:45,035 --> 00:50:48,630
That wouldn't sail across the Serpentine,
let alone around India.

576
00:50:48,973 --> 00:50:50,463
It's a bloody riverboat.

577
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:55,544
It's the right size, and there won't be
any great uproar when it's found missing.

578
00:51:01,785 --> 00:51:04,219
There's something very peculiar
going on, Bill.

579
00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:06,683
- What is it?
- What's what?

580
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,724
You never shave at night.

581
00:51:08,993 --> 00:51:12,121
Rather a novelty, I thought, for once.
Not to shave in the morning...

582
00:51:12,296 --> 00:51:13,786
...when I'm still asleep.

583
00:51:14,098 --> 00:51:16,293
- That's not it.
- Not what?

584
00:51:17,735 --> 00:51:20,898
Bill, you can really be
the most exasperating...

585
00:51:21,905 --> 00:51:24,339
Well, I'm probably being
even more exasperating.

586
00:51:24,942 --> 00:51:26,933
A good wife does not pry.

587
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:30,512
You can pry as much as you like.
No, the reason I'm shaving now...

588
00:51:30,614 --> 00:51:34,106
...is because I have to get up
tomorrow morning at 4:00...

589
00:51:34,151 --> 00:51:38,019
...and go charging up to Ranchi
in a bloody truck to do two weeks...

590
00:51:38,055 --> 00:51:39,852
...of incredibly boring training.

591
00:51:39,957 --> 00:51:42,926
Whatever it is,
it's far too important to you.

592
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:44,858
Oh, really.

593
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,425
It's another woman, isn't it?

594
00:51:50,968 --> 00:51:52,230
Isn't it?

595
00:51:52,836 --> 00:51:54,827
Another woman? Me?

596
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,006
I have never loved, nor will I ever love,
anyone but you.

597
00:52:05,883 --> 00:52:08,681
Now you've gone
and got me all lathered up.

598
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:41,403
- Hold it!
- What the hell is this?

599
00:53:42,312 --> 00:53:44,246
No questions, just answers.

600
00:53:44,314 --> 00:53:47,715
Now, if you create any problems,
we shall have to kill you.

601
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:06,094
Have you taken a look at the engine?

602
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:08,470
No, but I have a general idea.

603
00:54:08,572 --> 00:54:10,096
It belongs in a museum.

604
00:54:10,274 --> 00:54:12,674
So do some of us. Well, cheer up.

605
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,874
Let's take a stroll on the promenade deck.

606
00:54:16,013 --> 00:54:17,378
Oh, my God.

607
00:54:18,582 --> 00:54:21,779
I've got this end, you take care
of the other.

608
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:28,485
I've been saving this for a long time.
Now I know why. To us.

609
00:54:33,096 --> 00:54:34,222
To us.

610
00:54:39,236 --> 00:54:40,396
To us.

611
00:54:45,709 --> 00:54:47,142
To the operation.

612
00:54:47,211 --> 00:54:48,303
Amen.

613
00:54:58,622 --> 00:55:02,956
I haven't got the faintest idea what makes
this thing work. Do you?

614
00:55:05,896 --> 00:55:07,557
See you in Cochin.

615
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:34,514
'''The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.'''

616
00:56:36,086 --> 00:56:37,314
Get up and...

617
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:42,381
Not into the wind, Robin.
Oh, God, he's done it again.

618
00:56:42,592 --> 00:56:46,084
For God's sake, don't describe it.
I'm going down below to hit myself...

619
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:50,132
...over the head with a hammer.
Remember I've still got to cook.

620
00:57:12,055 --> 00:57:14,046
What an industrious chap.

621
00:57:17,294 --> 00:57:21,560
- You wouldn't, you sadistic...
- What wouldn't I?

622
00:57:21,598 --> 00:57:25,159
You know, Yogi, when we get
to wherever it is we're going...

623
00:57:25,469 --> 00:57:26,561
...I'll kill you.

624
00:57:26,603 --> 00:57:29,504
Mind over matter, Robin.
Think digestively.

625
00:57:34,378 --> 00:57:37,870
I must have been a damn fool
to have taken on this job.

626
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:39,771
Grab one.

627
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:58,233
Well, Jack old chum, if anyone has
to swim for it, this is where you'll be.

628
00:57:58,802 --> 00:58:02,761
Jack Cartwright, the entire on-shore rescue
and first-aid team.

629
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,931
You'd better put a lorry up there.

630
00:58:05,976 --> 00:58:09,434
Should you pick anyone up,
they're to be taken straight out of Goa.

631
00:58:09,646 --> 00:58:11,876
If you must drive through
the border barricades...

632
00:58:11,948 --> 00:58:14,178
...and take over that river ferry, do it.

633
00:58:20,357 --> 00:58:24,350
Oh, sorry. Thank God, you're not my wife.

634
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:28,955
Any kind of physical contact brings on
the most outrageous sexual demands.

635
00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:31,297
The woman's insatiable.

636
00:58:31,468 --> 00:58:33,060
You're a lucky fellow.

637
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:35,570
She bites, it's bloody undignified.

638
00:58:35,772 --> 00:58:38,297
At my age, I prefer a bit
of grateful whimpering...

639
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:41,173
...even if it's only from me.

640
00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:45,476
I may never survive the train ride.

641
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:48,176
Talking of survival, Lewis...

642
00:58:48,218 --> 00:58:50,379
...I swore to myself I'd never ask this...

643
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:53,479
...which is why I'm asking,
but all those explosives...

644
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:55,888
...we loaded onto that ridiculous Phoebe...

645
00:58:55,992 --> 00:58:57,619
...what on earth are they for?

646
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:23,052
It's my opinion we're going to storm
a mountaintop convent...

647
00:59:23,386 --> 00:59:25,251
...with bowler hats and varicose veins.

648
00:59:25,355 --> 00:59:26,652
And umbrellas.

649
00:59:26,756 --> 00:59:28,747
And the nuns'll shoot our tails off.

650
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:30,953
- Or someone will.
- Let's play bridge.

651
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:35,653
Old Lovecroft must have melons
for adenoids.

652
00:59:41,805 --> 00:59:43,295
The next round's on me.

653
00:59:43,807 --> 00:59:46,275
Cromwell. C-R-O-M-W-E-L-L.

654
00:59:48,912 --> 00:59:50,675
Hold on. Who is it?

655
00:59:51,181 --> 00:59:52,273
Jack.

656
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:56,677
It's open. Hello?

657
00:59:57,621 --> 00:59:59,521
Yes, you have it?

658
00:59:59,823 --> 01:00:01,814
What do you mean,
you can't give it to me?

659
01:00:01,992 --> 01:00:05,894
It's unlisted? Well, where are you?
I'll come down and pay you.

660
01:00:07,497 --> 01:00:10,898
We all have to learn to live
with the odd insult, don't we?

661
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:12,593
Try and beat that combination.

662
01:00:12,736 --> 01:00:15,534
An incorruptible telephone operator
and a woman with...

663
01:00:15,705 --> 01:00:17,730
...an unlisted telephone number.

664
01:00:18,008 --> 01:00:21,409
A raving beauty, dammit.
Come on, you have to put that...

665
01:00:21,511 --> 01:00:25,106
...in a safe-deposit box
at the Portuguese National Bank.

666
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:31,712
My God, they'll chuck me overboard.

667
01:01:05,722 --> 01:01:07,690
There's a periscope out there!

668
01:01:08,191 --> 01:01:09,488
Periscope!

669
01:01:13,797 --> 01:01:15,890
It's off the starboard bow.

670
01:01:16,499 --> 01:01:17,830
I don't see a thing.

671
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:19,195
Where is it?

672
01:01:19,402 --> 01:01:20,835
Look... there!

673
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:23,238
That's the port bow, idiot!

674
01:01:23,506 --> 01:01:25,906
Well, whatever it is,
God help us, we're dead.

675
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:30,237
I'll take the wheel.

676
01:01:32,115 --> 01:01:33,912
Give me those glasses. Where is it?

677
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,851
On the... On the port bow.

678
01:01:38,722 --> 01:01:42,419
If we're blown up, everybody get a bit
of wreckage and cling to it.

679
01:01:42,525 --> 01:01:44,117
That's hilarious.

680
01:01:49,132 --> 01:01:50,622
Wait a minute.

681
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:52,733
I've got it.

682
01:01:54,037 --> 01:01:57,871
What an incredible piece of camouflage.
It looks exactly like a shark fin.

683
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:01,174
They're clever devils, I'll give them that.

684
01:02:02,379 --> 01:02:04,279
It's a shark, Mr. Manners.

685
01:02:06,716 --> 01:02:08,911
Is that all you can say? '''Oh? '''

686
01:02:09,286 --> 01:02:12,585
Sorry. You know I... Sorry.

687
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,123
I prefer '''Oh.'''

688
01:02:17,494 --> 01:02:18,791
Damn fool.

689
01:02:19,796 --> 01:02:21,991
Six days each week
of government bureaucracy...

690
01:02:22,299 --> 01:02:24,824
...taxes the mind and body
to the limits of endurance.

691
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:26,892
It's good of you to see me,
Senhor Montero.

692
01:02:27,003 --> 01:02:27,731
Not at all.

693
01:02:27,804 --> 01:02:30,602
You want to enjoy your day off
and my time is limited...

694
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,904
...so may we drop the formalities?

695
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:34,538
As you wish.

696
01:02:34,611 --> 01:02:38,604
I want you to use your influence to
persuade the governor to have a reception.

697
01:02:39,215 --> 01:02:42,946
Among the invited guests will be
every port official from Mormugoa...

698
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,421
...and the officers from every ship
at anchor in the harbour.

699
01:02:46,523 --> 01:02:50,459
You will, on the same night, arrange
a carnival which will attract the crews...

700
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:52,820
...of all the ships. Well?

701
01:02:55,932 --> 01:02:57,832
You mentioned my sons.

702
01:02:58,468 --> 01:03:03,167
Yes, I can arrange that your sons continue
to enjoy their schooling in India...

703
01:03:05,175 --> 01:03:09,509
...and that their fees are paid directly
into a bank there. Yes or no?

704
01:03:13,183 --> 01:03:14,775
A wise decision.

705
01:03:16,086 --> 01:03:19,681
The invitations have already been printed.
The date is March 8.

706
01:03:20,223 --> 01:03:22,691
The time: 2100.

707
01:03:22,826 --> 01:03:24,589
Your reason for this, Senhor?

708
01:03:24,694 --> 01:03:27,527
That is a question you do not ask.
It is simply a display...

709
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:30,224
...of your country's hospitality
and neutrality.

710
01:03:32,202 --> 01:03:35,797
Now, these are for your immediate use.
I'm sure your list of expenses...

711
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:39,240
...will be very imaginative.
And one more thing:

712
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:42,403
I'd hate like hell to see anything go wrong.

713
01:03:42,512 --> 01:03:44,810
For your sake, and the children.

714
01:04:12,609 --> 01:04:14,702
Mrs. Cromwell.

715
01:04:15,912 --> 01:04:17,379
I don't know what comes first...

716
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,812
...the hello, the apology,
or the explanation.

717
01:04:19,883 --> 01:04:21,282
None of them. Excuse me.

718
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:24,218
- Well, I owe you at least two out of three.
- Please.

719
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:26,018
- How's Hamlet?
- Dammit!

720
01:04:28,525 --> 01:04:30,493
I prefer not to make a scene here.

721
01:04:30,593 --> 01:04:32,424
Why don't we sit down?

722
01:04:40,303 --> 01:04:41,429
How is Hamlet?

723
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:43,631
Look, I don't appreciate it.

724
01:04:44,808 --> 01:04:46,207
Some wine...

725
01:04:46,409 --> 01:04:48,604
...champagne, a lovely cigar?

726
01:04:50,413 --> 01:04:51,607
Later.

727
01:04:54,818 --> 01:04:59,118
Hello, Mrs. Cromwell, and I can't tell you
how sorry I am. That's two.

728
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:02,756
I find all that charm unbearable.

729
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:05,257
Quite truthfully, so do I.

730
01:05:05,295 --> 01:05:07,559
The best I can do is apologize.

731
01:05:07,664 --> 01:05:10,360
If you would accept that, we could talk.

732
01:05:12,402 --> 01:05:14,666
It was an ugly... incident.

733
01:05:15,872 --> 01:05:18,670
You killed a man as though
it were nothing.

734
01:05:19,776 --> 01:05:21,971
He was about to kill us both.

735
01:05:22,579 --> 01:05:24,570
You've done it before, haven't you?

736
01:05:27,884 --> 01:05:32,321
Yes. I was an officer in the Army
for a while and then the Bengali police...

737
01:05:32,422 --> 01:05:34,185
...made me a better offer.

738
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,019
And now you're a tea merchant.

739
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:39,390
Yes. I didn't like being a police officer...

740
01:05:41,598 --> 01:05:44,089
...and I don't wander around killing people.

741
01:05:47,904 --> 01:05:52,898
Next you're going to accuse me of killing
the poor, unfortunate owner of this place.

742
01:05:53,142 --> 01:05:55,042
It had crossed my mind.

743
01:05:56,012 --> 01:06:00,745
Mrs. Cromwell, I really would much rather
talk about you, and possibly even me.

744
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:05,250
You know it wouldn't take a great deal
for me to fall in love with you.

745
01:06:06,055 --> 01:06:08,546
No comment? All right, I have one.

746
01:06:11,294 --> 01:06:14,092
Why don't we pick up where we left off...

747
01:06:14,464 --> 01:06:18,264
...be exceptionally wary of each other
and see what develops?

748
01:06:19,602 --> 01:06:22,002
No comment. Yet.

749
01:06:28,878 --> 01:06:30,675
Wine, Mrs. Cromwell?

750
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:34,008
Wine.

751
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:37,976
- Whose deal is it?
- Yours.

752
01:06:39,322 --> 01:06:41,790
- Did you order us a beer?
- Yes.

753
01:06:43,526 --> 01:06:46,427
I wonder why they asked us
if we could swim.

754
01:06:47,297 --> 01:06:48,491
One thing's certain:

755
01:06:48,531 --> 01:06:52,194
This is better than thumping round
the coast in that dirty old bucket.

756
01:06:52,235 --> 01:06:55,693
I pity Breene. Awful bloody sailor,
you know. Suffers hell.

757
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:57,703
- So did Nelson.
- Nelson?

758
01:06:57,807 --> 01:06:59,001
Admiral Nelson, you fool.

759
01:06:59,108 --> 01:07:01,042
You know, '''England expects... '''

760
01:07:01,945 --> 01:07:03,537
Over here, chaps.

761
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:18,084
If they've been lucky, the Phoebe should be
outside Cochin Harbour tomorrow night...

762
01:07:18,795 --> 01:07:22,390
...and we'll be off
on a lovely sun-drenched cruise.

763
01:07:23,766 --> 01:07:26,997
You'll each receive a boarding schedule
and detailed instructions.

764
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:30,267
Please memorize them and destroy them.

765
01:07:30,373 --> 01:07:34,469
No one is to carry any letters
or documents that might associate him...

766
01:07:34,677 --> 01:07:36,110
...with the Light Horse.

767
01:07:36,312 --> 01:07:37,301
Tomorrow...

768
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,576
...you will each go separately to the bazaar
and buy two bottles of whisky...

769
01:07:42,418 --> 01:07:45,512
...which you will keep in your luggage
unopened.

770
01:07:46,489 --> 01:07:49,322
You're to be packed and ready
by 1700 hours.

771
01:07:50,827 --> 01:07:55,594
I can't give you any details on the
operation itself until we're safely at sea.

772
01:07:58,835 --> 01:08:00,268
Any questions?

773
01:08:01,137 --> 01:08:02,035
No, sir.

774
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:04,028
Good.

775
01:08:04,029 --> 01:08:08,329
If any of you might be thinking
of getting sozzled tonight...

776
01:08:08,345 --> 01:08:10,444
Splendid. I expect to.

777
01:08:11,247 --> 01:08:12,646
End of briefing.

778
01:09:27,156 --> 01:09:30,353
Desapareca daqui sujo... porco canalha.

779
01:09:35,765 --> 01:09:38,859
Senhor, ha-de perdoar esse zaragateiro.

780
01:09:40,203 --> 01:09:42,103
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

781
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,602
No, Senhor.

782
01:09:43,706 --> 01:09:44,695
English...Ja.

783
01:09:44,774 --> 01:09:47,868
Yes, Senhor.
You perhaps wish something?

784
01:09:48,811 --> 01:09:51,177
We can give you anything
you should desire.

785
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,474
Anything.

786
01:09:52,515 --> 01:09:53,777
This is your house?

787
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:55,078
Yes, Senhor.

788
01:09:55,218 --> 01:09:56,776
All clean girls...

789
01:09:57,086 --> 01:09:58,883
...and all beautiful.

790
01:09:59,288 --> 01:10:01,313
I have an unusual request.

791
01:10:02,825 --> 01:10:05,020
Nothing is strange here, Senhor.

792
01:10:05,194 --> 01:10:08,721
Many years ago I was a sailor.
Now I am a rich man.

793
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:13,131
But always a sailor in your heart.
I understand.

794
01:10:13,302 --> 01:10:15,031
You wish something special, yes?

795
01:10:15,104 --> 01:10:18,232
I would like to give every sailor
in the port...

796
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:22,200
...a gift to celebrate
my good fortune in life.

797
01:10:23,146 --> 01:10:27,105
Now, you will tell every nationality
of sailor in the harbour...

798
01:10:27,216 --> 01:10:32,210
...that for three days, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, they can come to this street...

799
01:10:32,722 --> 01:10:34,713
...and do with girls at no cost.

800
01:10:35,258 --> 01:10:37,852
What a beautiful thing you do, sir.

801
01:10:38,427 --> 01:10:41,658
I'm glad you think so.
Now, can we agree to the price?

802
01:10:42,932 --> 01:10:45,025
Please come, Senhor.

803
01:10:46,836 --> 01:10:50,932
You know this is exceedingly odd.
I hardly know anything about you.

804
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:55,535
I don't know where you live.
I don't even know your phone number.

805
01:10:55,778 --> 01:10:59,214
You don't have to.
All we've done is enjoy each other.

806
01:11:01,651 --> 01:11:04,711
I am falling in love with you,
Mrs. Cromwell.

807
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,114
I'll go better than that.

808
01:11:11,527 --> 01:11:12,789
I have.

809
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:17,897
Gavin, I don't want to go home now,
but I'm going to.

810
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:20,894
- All right, I'll take you.
- No.

811
01:11:23,306 --> 01:11:25,638
I still can't know where you live?

812
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:28,233
Not until I understand how I feel.

813
01:11:39,255 --> 01:11:41,553
I'd like to get dressed now.

814
01:11:51,734 --> 01:11:53,258
You do love me?

815
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,939
Give me time to think.
I promise to call you.

816
01:12:26,168 --> 01:12:28,329
They're the last two. Come along.

817
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,036
Come along.

818
01:12:34,744 --> 01:12:36,905
Sorry, Sandy, we got held up.

819
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:52,526
- Adeus, Senhor.
- Adeus.

820
01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:54,455
Gavin!

821
01:12:55,131 --> 01:12:58,965
Hello, Jack. How was your second visit
with your friendly whorehouse keeper?

822
01:12:59,035 --> 01:13:02,163
Absolute cert.
Every sailor knows all about it.

823
01:13:02,405 --> 01:13:06,569
As he was taking the rest of the money
he called me a true benefactor...

824
01:13:06,776 --> 01:13:08,903
...of all whores and seamen.

825
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:12,270
Rather appropriate play on words,
don't you think?

826
01:13:12,315 --> 01:13:16,308
I'm also his life-Iong friend
for whom he'd shed blood and brandy.

827
01:13:16,385 --> 01:13:18,580
- He shed the brandy, didn't he?
- He did.

828
01:13:18,688 --> 01:13:20,815
Why don't you go to your room
and lie down?

829
01:13:20,923 --> 01:13:23,517
There's nothing else to be done
until tonight.

830
01:13:23,626 --> 01:13:27,084
I was going to. I may even pray a bit.
Where are you going?

831
01:13:27,897 --> 01:13:31,424
Talking of praying, to church.
The phone call I waited for two days for...

832
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,694
...finally came.

833
01:13:32,802 --> 01:13:34,997
- I'm glad to hear it.
- So was I.

834
01:13:35,037 --> 01:13:37,130
- Did you say church?
- Yes.

835
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:53,348
Warte hier.

836
01:15:37,293 --> 01:15:38,419
Gavin?

837
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,799
Who are you?

838
01:15:55,945 --> 01:15:59,779
I'll need a table. Will you bring that
up here for me, please?

839
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:04,048
That's fine, thank you.

840
01:16:04,854 --> 01:16:08,290
Now then, we're on the last lap
of our little trip...

841
01:16:10,593 --> 01:16:12,891
...so I can now give you our destination...

842
01:16:12,962 --> 01:16:15,954
...and tell you what we're going to do
when we get there.

843
01:16:16,098 --> 01:16:18,999
We're headed for the neutral port
of Mormugoa.

844
01:16:19,368 --> 01:16:20,858
I told you so.

845
01:16:21,003 --> 01:16:22,766
In that port, at anchor...

846
01:16:22,872 --> 01:16:25,363
...is a German ship, the Ehrenfels.

847
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:28,803
Our job is to seize that ship.

848
01:16:30,379 --> 01:16:31,368
Good Lord.

849
01:16:31,413 --> 01:16:33,381
And hold a dance aboard?

850
01:16:33,516 --> 01:16:35,507
Or sink her where she is.

851
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:38,218
Also in that port are two other
German ships...

852
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,484
...so if we can knock them off
at the same time, so much the better.

853
01:16:44,293 --> 01:16:47,592
But first, the Ehrenfels.
Here is her deck plan.

854
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:51,491
Study it very carefully and then I'll deal
with any questions.

855
01:16:51,901 --> 01:16:52,925
- Bill?
- Yes?

856
01:16:53,435 --> 01:16:55,335
- We've got problems.
- What's wrong?

857
01:16:55,404 --> 01:16:59,101
- The main bearing is overheating.
- Can you do anything about it?

858
01:16:59,508 --> 01:17:03,137
Only if I stop the engine.
It's a question of dismantling...

859
01:17:03,245 --> 01:17:05,736
...the bearing and fitting a new shell.

860
01:17:05,948 --> 01:17:07,176
If I can.

861
01:17:10,386 --> 01:17:11,751
How long would it take?

862
01:17:11,787 --> 01:17:14,779
Two to three hours.
And, sir, I said, '''If I can.'''

863
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:19,057
Yes, I heard you, Charlie.
Can we keep going as it is?

864
01:17:19,361 --> 01:17:20,794
Not for long.

865
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:31,665
All right. Stop your engine.
See what you can do.

866
01:17:33,075 --> 01:17:35,168
We desperately needed that.

867
01:17:36,412 --> 01:17:38,812
We have a little leeway. Not much.

868
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:41,980
Carry on.

869
01:17:43,485 --> 01:17:44,611
Now...

870
01:17:46,488 --> 01:17:48,388
...on the foredeck, here...

871
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:14,843
I didn't want to push my luck
on the telephone, but why a church?

872
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:17,145
I didn't want to meet you in a cafe again.

873
01:18:17,186 --> 01:18:18,949
Or in a hotel room.

874
01:18:19,655 --> 01:18:20,952
No comment.

875
01:18:21,056 --> 01:18:22,785
I'm glad you called.

876
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:25,259
I don't know whether I am or not...

877
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:28,660
...I just know I'm afraid to trust
my own feelings.

878
01:18:29,298 --> 01:18:30,663
Which are?

879
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:32,693
Terribly confused.

880
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,365
I'm afraid I don't understand.

881
01:18:37,072 --> 01:18:38,096
Try.

882
01:18:40,409 --> 01:18:43,708
We can start tonight
at the governor-general's party.

883
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,974
You mean the governor-general of Goa?

884
01:18:48,884 --> 01:18:50,784
Why would he invite me to a party?

885
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:54,387
I don't even know the governor-general
and I'm sure it's mutual.

886
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:55,889
I'm invited.

887
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:58,525
Would you take me?

888
01:19:00,729 --> 01:19:02,458
All right, I'll take you.

889
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:05,329
9:00. 21 da Gama Street.

890
01:19:07,169 --> 01:19:09,433
Now you have my address.

891
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,567
The progress is astonishing.

892
01:19:15,344 --> 01:19:16,743
Are we leaving?

893
01:19:16,879 --> 01:19:18,870
You are. Alone. Please.

894
01:19:20,849 --> 01:19:24,546
Well, I am available the rest of the day.
Conversation only.

895
01:19:25,754 --> 01:19:27,551
Tea planter's honour.

896
01:19:28,057 --> 01:19:29,547
9:00.

897
01:20:36,225 --> 01:20:39,058
That may do it, and it may not.

898
01:20:39,928 --> 01:20:42,556
Two and a half hours.
All right, let's find out.

899
01:20:43,465 --> 01:20:44,932
Ready to move, Bill.

900
01:20:46,568 --> 01:20:47,728
Right.

901
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:07,887
What can you get out of her at full speed?

902
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:10,290
Six knots, maybe seven.

903
01:21:10,993 --> 01:21:12,187
Try ten.

904
01:21:50,766 --> 01:21:52,734
That's it. Your turn, Sandy.

905
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:02,066
Good. Underhill...

906
01:22:02,177 --> 01:22:05,874
Limpet mines attach magnetically
to the hull of the ship...

907
01:22:08,684 --> 01:22:12,313
...below the waterline.
They work on a pre-set timer.

908
01:22:12,621 --> 01:22:14,919
You mean this, this knob here?

909
01:22:15,591 --> 01:22:18,583
Yes, that's right. Now, Finley,
you'll take the Drachenfels.

910
01:22:18,694 --> 01:22:20,491
Sloane, you take the Braunfels.

911
01:22:20,596 --> 01:22:21,585
Right.

912
01:22:29,805 --> 01:22:30,897
Jack!

913
01:23:51,853 --> 01:23:53,320
- Senhor Stewart?
- Yes.

914
01:23:53,522 --> 01:23:55,854
- Good evening, sir. Please.
- Thank you.

915
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:12,166
Please, sit down.

916
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:14,869
Mrs. Cromwell shall be...

917
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:15,999
Ready soon?

918
01:24:16,111 --> 01:24:19,171
Yes. Not good English. Excuse, Senhor.

919
01:25:23,278 --> 01:25:24,210
Where is she?

920
01:25:30,285 --> 01:25:35,313
Thanks to Charlie Wilton, we should be
alongside the Ehrenfels on schedule...

921
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:38,721
...by 0100 hours.
I don't have to tell you how...

922
01:25:38,994 --> 01:25:43,124
...crucial this operation is
or how many allied lives it might save.

923
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:48,291
Our cover story once again.
We are businessmen on holiday.

924
01:25:48,403 --> 01:25:52,897
We rented this old tub in Bombay,
sailed down to Goa for the fun of it...

925
01:25:53,642 --> 01:25:56,736
...and on a drunken dare,
boarded the Ehrenfels.

926
01:25:57,112 --> 01:26:01,845
Of course, authentic drunken businessmen
seldom run about with machine guns.

927
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:06,678
Should any of you find yourselves in a
tight spot, if it's the last thing you do..

928
01:26:07,456 --> 01:26:09,447
...throw your guns over the side.

929
01:26:09,491 --> 01:26:11,652
If any of you have to swim for it...

930
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,952
...you know the location
of Cartwright's beach.

931
01:26:15,097 --> 01:26:17,759
Jack will be there waiting for you.

932
01:26:18,266 --> 01:26:21,667
Charlie, you will remain aboard
to nurse the engine.

933
01:26:21,703 --> 01:26:23,694
- Sir...
- That's an order, Charlie.

934
01:26:25,273 --> 01:26:27,764
Yes, sir. Shit, sir!

935
01:26:29,978 --> 01:26:32,412
Charlie, you really do have
a way with words.

936
01:26:33,081 --> 01:26:34,070
John...

937
01:26:34,883 --> 01:26:37,317
...you'll stay at the wheel. No arguments.

938
01:26:37,385 --> 01:26:39,285
Can I say, '''shit''' as well, sir?

939
01:26:39,387 --> 01:26:40,786
If you like.

940
01:26:40,889 --> 01:26:42,982
All right, let's open up the whisky.

941
01:26:43,091 --> 01:26:44,080
About time.

942
01:26:44,126 --> 01:26:47,425
One big swig now,
and no more until further orders.

943
01:26:50,599 --> 01:26:51,588
Cheers.

944
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,190
Down the hatch.

945
01:28:29,698 --> 01:28:33,361
Your Excellency, Gavin Stewart.
Hadley's of Bombay Limited.

946
01:28:33,401 --> 01:28:37,667
Mr. Stewart, how nice to see you.
Darling, may I present Mr. Stewart.

947
01:28:38,406 --> 01:28:39,771
A pleasure.

948
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:41,570
And my daughter, Teresa.

949
01:28:41,676 --> 01:28:42,608
Senhorita.

950
01:28:42,677 --> 01:28:44,167
And Mrs. Cromwell.

951
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:47,073
Mrs. Cromwell and I
already know each other.

952
01:28:47,415 --> 01:28:50,873
In fact, with your permission,
I'm going to steal her away from you.

953
01:28:50,919 --> 01:28:53,114
Please do. Enjoy yourselves.

954
01:28:53,321 --> 01:28:55,687
Thank you, sir. Shall we?

955
01:28:59,928 --> 01:29:01,919
You look absolutely beautiful.

956
01:29:02,964 --> 01:29:04,864
I don't blame you for being angry.

957
01:29:05,133 --> 01:29:09,126
I wouldn't have waited for me either.
I can't begin to apologize.

958
01:29:09,437 --> 01:29:11,029
Don't be silly, it's accepted.

959
01:29:12,941 --> 01:29:14,374
Where were you?

960
01:29:14,843 --> 01:29:18,973
Well, you won't believe me.
It's really a sort of tragedy of errors.

961
01:29:20,448 --> 01:29:24,077
First, a puncture in the middle of nowhere,
then I nearly ripped...

962
01:29:24,152 --> 01:29:26,848
...the sleeve off my jacket
trying to change the wheel.

963
01:29:26,955 --> 01:29:29,651
A mad dash for a replacement jacket,
which doesn't fit...

964
01:29:29,758 --> 01:29:30,782
So I see.

965
01:29:30,892 --> 01:29:34,589
And naturally, they're still not giving out
your phone number, and finally...

966
01:29:34,663 --> 01:29:37,655
...when I got to 31 da Gama Street,
there was no one at home.

967
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,960
Gavin... it's 21.

968
01:29:41,569 --> 01:29:42,866
Not 31?

969
01:29:44,205 --> 01:29:45,672
There you are, I am an idiot.

970
01:29:45,707 --> 01:29:46,901
Agreed.

971
01:29:47,108 --> 01:29:50,168
But a rather nice one.
I'd left by then anyway.

972
01:29:51,413 --> 01:29:55,076
I called your hotel.
They said you'd gone out quite early.

973
01:29:56,584 --> 01:30:00,315
How did you get in here without
an invitation? And I'm glad.

974
01:30:01,323 --> 01:30:03,883
Well, I crossed the majordomo's palm.

975
01:30:06,328 --> 01:30:07,590
Shocking.

976
01:30:07,729 --> 01:30:10,391
Now, to show you the stuff
I'm really made of...

977
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,734
...I'd like to apologize properly.

978
01:30:14,803 --> 01:30:17,897
First, I'd like to kiss you, Mrs. Cromwell.

979
01:30:21,209 --> 01:30:22,699
I'd like that.

980
01:31:20,035 --> 01:31:22,299
Lipstick doesn't become you.

981
01:31:23,004 --> 01:31:24,301
Let me.

982
01:32:19,894 --> 01:32:21,828
Would you care to join her?

983
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:24,294
Then, I assume you've seen nothing.

984
01:32:24,332 --> 01:32:25,799
Am I correct?

985
01:32:27,235 --> 01:32:28,600
Then start laughing.

986
01:32:29,137 --> 01:32:30,001
Laugh.

987
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:57,564
You'll remember your children, Senhor.

988
01:33:27,128 --> 01:33:29,323
All right, take your weapons.

989
01:33:49,951 --> 01:33:51,942
- Any problems?
- No, sir.

990
01:33:53,321 --> 01:33:54,413
Mr. Cartwright?

991
01:33:54,522 --> 01:33:56,149
Buried there, sir.

992
01:34:12,073 --> 01:34:14,303
Take my car and park it near the hotel.

993
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:16,866
Yes, sir. Are you all right, sir?

994
01:34:17,912 --> 01:34:19,402
Yes, fine thanks.

995
01:34:31,526 --> 01:34:32,686
There we are.

996
01:34:33,294 --> 01:34:36,195
The first of Gavin's brilliant diversions.

997
01:34:37,599 --> 01:34:39,897
I never had a moment's doubt, old bean.

998
01:34:39,934 --> 01:34:42,994
I did. If we'd relied on this compass,
we might've wound up...

999
01:34:43,037 --> 01:34:44,937
...in the Grand Canyon.

1000
01:34:47,342 --> 01:34:49,003
What a lovely sight.

1001
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:52,746
Reminds me of Brighton
when I was about 10 years old.

1002
01:34:53,047 --> 01:34:55,948
Dickie, I find it hard to believe
you were ever 10 years old.

1003
01:34:56,017 --> 01:34:57,109
Chuckle, chuckle.

1004
01:34:57,218 --> 01:34:58,207
Gentlemen...

1005
01:34:59,787 --> 01:35:01,948
Mr. Finley, Mr. Sloane, time to get ready.

1006
01:35:02,056 --> 01:35:03,387
Right, sir.

1007
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:08,458
If any of you have any final questions,
now would be a splendid time.

1008
01:35:09,397 --> 01:35:11,365
When do we get another drink, sir?

1009
01:35:11,466 --> 01:35:13,593
Right now, as a matter of fact.

1010
01:35:13,768 --> 01:35:16,999
I want each of you to take
another big swallow, just one.

1011
01:35:17,272 --> 01:35:20,673
Next, rinse your mouths thoroughly
with whiskey and spit it out...

1012
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:24,174
...then take what's left
and pour it over your clothing.

1013
01:35:24,212 --> 01:35:26,180
- All of it, sir?
- All of it.

1014
01:35:26,514 --> 01:35:29,677
I want every man here
to smell like a distillery.

1015
01:35:30,018 --> 01:35:32,384
All right. Get on with it!

1016
01:35:37,692 --> 01:35:39,489
Anybody got any soda?

1017
01:35:51,706 --> 01:35:54,300
I didn't mean to do that, I swear it.

1018
01:35:57,211 --> 01:35:59,771
This is the noblest sacrifice of all.

1019
01:35:59,947 --> 01:36:01,972
The fumes alone are getting me tiddly.

1020
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:06,986
You may save your second bottle
for our celebration on the way to Bombay.

1021
01:36:38,186 --> 01:36:39,710
When we board...

1022
01:36:40,021 --> 01:36:43,479
...I want no firing
unless it's absolutely necessary.

1023
01:36:46,227 --> 01:36:48,195
Should anything unpleasant happen...

1024
01:36:48,396 --> 01:36:51,991
...and we sustain dead or wounded,
they are not to be left...

1025
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:54,625
...aboard the Ehrenfels, nor any equipment.

1026
01:36:55,103 --> 01:36:57,936
Nothing which could identify us as British.

1027
01:36:59,507 --> 01:37:03,841
When I blow this whistle three times,
everybody off immediately.

1028
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:10,883
You'll do.

1029
01:37:12,887 --> 01:37:14,252
Take your stations.

1030
01:37:14,455 --> 01:37:17,083
All weapons loaded. Safety catches on.

1031
01:37:21,963 --> 01:37:23,760
Check our watches.

1032
01:37:24,465 --> 01:37:27,866
When you set your mines, remember,
give us 30 minutes.

1033
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:30,704
That's still not much time.

1034
01:37:30,772 --> 01:37:33,502
You surprise me. We'll have all the time
in the world.

1035
01:37:33,574 --> 01:37:35,007
Now, do get on with it.

1036
01:37:35,076 --> 01:37:38,409
You're the boss, Lewis.
My God, you breath is awful.

1037
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:16,471
Well, might as well.
Won't help me see in the dark, will it?

1038
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:11,120
Yogi, the mine.

1039
01:41:45,326 --> 01:41:47,123
- Klasse.
- Wundervoll.

1040
01:41:47,428 --> 01:41:50,022
- Fantastisch.
- Herrlich.

1041
01:41:58,039 --> 01:41:59,768
Come on, move.

1042
01:42:10,184 --> 01:42:11,913
Was ist?

1043
01:42:53,461 --> 01:42:55,156
Hands up. Silence!

1044
01:43:12,379 --> 01:43:15,314
- Sandy, come with me. You two stay here.
- Right.

1045
01:43:42,209 --> 01:43:43,437
This way.

1046
01:43:46,447 --> 01:43:47,914
Come with me.

1047
01:43:55,055 --> 01:43:57,421
Stay where you are. Not a sound.

1048
01:44:31,792 --> 01:44:34,192
I'm glad we're not staying on board.

1049
01:44:34,628 --> 01:44:36,425
Come on, let's go.

1050
01:44:57,518 --> 01:44:58,610
You!

1051
01:45:17,872 --> 01:45:19,772
Hold on. Blow this one!

1052
01:46:14,995 --> 01:46:16,053
Are you okay?

1053
01:46:16,263 --> 01:46:18,561
I think I'm still standing!

1054
01:46:20,768 --> 01:46:23,862
We've found it, Bill.
Get everyone organized to leave.

1055
01:46:23,971 --> 01:46:25,563
Sandy, look after Yogi.

1056
01:46:25,606 --> 01:46:28,166
- Come on, let's go.
- Barker, in here with me.

1057
01:46:35,282 --> 01:46:38,274
The code books. Get them on board
the Phoebe. Hurry.

1058
01:46:38,485 --> 01:46:39,679
Right.

1059
01:46:53,934 --> 01:46:55,799
Let's get it done and leave.

1060
01:47:31,071 --> 01:47:32,095
God!

1061
01:47:32,873 --> 01:47:34,170
My fault, Bill.

1062
01:47:34,274 --> 01:47:36,799
Never mind that.
Get ours to the Phoebe quick...

1063
01:47:37,211 --> 01:47:40,203
...and the Germans to the afterdeck
with the others.

1064
01:47:57,831 --> 01:48:00,425
Back on the Phoebe, everybody.
Back on the Phoebe.

1065
01:48:36,503 --> 01:48:39,370
Damn fools.
I mean, why don't they hurry up?

1066
01:48:47,281 --> 01:48:48,509
Good God.

1067
01:48:52,386 --> 01:48:54,684
Get them on the Phoebe, Bill.

1068
01:48:55,789 --> 01:48:56,778
Williamson!

1069
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:57,879
Sir.

1070
01:49:02,429 --> 01:49:05,762
Look after Dennison.
Red, put those with the others.

1071
01:49:06,233 --> 01:49:08,064
Come on my bonnie lads, move it!

1072
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:16,239
Turn around. I'll be watching you
from the top deck.

1073
01:49:16,477 --> 01:49:19,844
Make no mistake, I'll shoot
the first man who moves.

1074
01:49:24,651 --> 01:49:26,141
Where is Lovecroft?

1075
01:49:26,186 --> 01:49:28,086
Second deck. Wardroom.

1076
01:49:37,164 --> 01:49:38,597
In the Phoebe, Robin.

1077
01:50:09,997 --> 01:50:11,988
Red, take these weapons.

1078
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:46,028
Okay, I'll take him.

1079
01:50:52,739 --> 01:50:56,937
Everybody, over the side.
This ship is going to blow up.

1080
01:50:57,778 --> 01:51:01,077
Spring uber Bord.
Das Schiff ist in der Luft.

1081
01:51:10,290 --> 01:51:11,279
Start engines!

1082
01:51:11,592 --> 01:51:13,082
Start engines.

1083
01:51:52,633 --> 01:51:53,861
Push off!

1084
01:51:55,869 --> 01:51:57,131
Push off!

1085
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:00,971
Spanner, now let's see...

1086
01:52:04,378 --> 01:52:05,367
That's okay.

1087
01:52:12,586 --> 01:52:15,817
Bill, don't stand about! Get us underway!

1088
01:52:22,796 --> 01:52:24,286
Right, right.

1089
01:52:31,104 --> 01:52:32,594
Get them below.

1090
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:37,641
Help me up.

1091
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:49,646
I'm all right. Get out of here.

1092
01:52:50,223 --> 01:52:51,247
Lie down somewhere.

1093
01:52:51,358 --> 01:52:54,418
There's nothing to lie down on.
The timers aren't that accurate.

1094
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:57,019
- Charlie, give me an answer!
- I'm working.

1095
01:52:58,932 --> 01:53:01,162
You'd better have this.

1096
01:53:04,471 --> 01:53:06,564
This'll put pain to my polo for a bit.

1097
01:53:07,007 --> 01:53:10,704
You'll be playing polo with St. Peter
if this ship goes up.

1098
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:15,275
Ram, help Mr. Pugh.

1099
01:53:33,233 --> 01:53:37,101
- Somebody, what the hell's gone wrong?
- I'm working very hard, Billy.

1100
01:53:40,006 --> 01:53:43,203
- How long have we got on those mines?
- A couple of minutes, maybe.

1101
01:53:58,158 --> 01:53:58,920
Well...

1102
01:53:59,426 --> 01:54:00,393
Hold your breath.

1103
01:54:37,697 --> 01:54:40,291
Ease her up to full speed, Bill.

1104
01:54:55,916 --> 01:54:57,440
She's going up!

1105
01:55:15,469 --> 01:55:16,766
Good God!

1106
01:56:05,252 --> 01:56:06,651
Poor devils.

1107
01:56:14,861 --> 01:56:20,663
Bill, I wouldn't know how to begin
to thank you and the Light Horse.

1108
01:56:21,067 --> 01:56:24,503
I have a feeling they'll be
thanking you. I know I am.

1109
01:57:36,389 --> 01:57:42,327
