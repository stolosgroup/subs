JIM LAMPLEY:
Hard shots from Darius Jones

36
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,799
to the body and the head,

37
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,101
as he continues putting distance

between himself and Billy Hope
on the scorecards.

39

ROY JONES JR.:
This kid Jones is super fast,

40
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,944
and he's killing Billy
with just his left hand.

41
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,847
LAMPLEY: Jones,
a longer, quicker fighter,

42
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,882
has appeared to win
most of the rounds

43
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,884
to this point in the fight.

44
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,820
Keep them hands up!
Protect that eye!

45
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,155
Come on, chief!
Come on, move!

(crowd cheering)

47
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,626
There you go!

48
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,595
LAMPLEY: And the crowd comes alive
as Hope lands a right and a left.

49
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,797
Okay, here we go,
here we go.

50
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,435
LAMPLEY:
Good body shots by Hope.

51
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,236
- JONES: Dance with me, bitch.
- REFEREE: Let him go.

52
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,538
JONES JR.: There he goes
again with that attitude.

53
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,272
He never stops.

54
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,241
LAMPLEY: It's another
frustrating round for Hope.

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,544
He all right.
He ain't hurt him.

56
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,449
LAMPLEY: It's give and take,
ebb and flow,

57
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,016
here in this fight.

58
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,152
Come on, Billy,
turn the shit back!

59
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,321
LAMPLEY:
As Jones drives him back

60
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,256
- with another uppercut.
- JONES JR.: Whoa, good uppercut.

61
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,058
And now Jones again
going to the body...

62
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,760
Come on, baby,
get off those ropes!

63
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,395
LAMPLEY:
...trying to set up the finish

64
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,497
as he drives Hope back
into the ropes again.

65
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,532
- (Billy yells indistinctly)
- I got you, man. I got you.

66
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,368
- Huh? That's all you got?
- Uh-huh.

67
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,503
- That's all you got, huh?
- (Darius speaks indistinctly)

68
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,037
(bell clangs)

69
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,073
LAMPLEY: Watching,
close to Hope's corner,

70
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,042
- (crowd cheering)
- his beautiful wife, Maureen,

71
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,179
herself a product
of a Hell's Kitchen orphanage.

72
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,215
- BILLY: How's the eye?
- Take many more, it's gonna flow.

73
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,050
Yeah, just fix
the fuckin' eye.

74
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,086
LAMPLEY: State Commission
doctor taking a good look

75
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:22,723
at Hope's left eye
in the corner.

76
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,792
But the fight will continue.

77
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,595
We've seen Billy Hope
win fights in the past

78
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,964
looking even more the worse
for wear than is the case here.

79
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,800
Nothing has changed tonight.

80
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,502
LAMPLEY: Seated at ringside,

81
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,070
light heavyweight contender
Miguel "Magic" Escobar,

82
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,872
who would love
to fight the winner.

83
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,108
Okay, keep him on
the end of your stick.

84
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,043
And don't stand
in front of him.

85
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,380
Get yours, relocate. It's like
the bull and the matador.

86
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:49,082
This is your fuckin' ring.
You're the fuckin' champ, right?

87
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,751
Just go back in and do what
we do; you gotta end this.

88
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,319
Hey, Billy. Billy.

89
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,688
All right, do me a favor
and keep those hands up.

90
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,824
MAN:
Billy, stay focused.

91
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,760
End it. You don't have time
for this bullshit.

92
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,194
Put an end to this
so we can go the fuck home.

93
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,863
What do you think
I'm trying to do, Eli?

94
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,398
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

95
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,266
Get the shit off my eye!
Let's go! Come on!

96
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,135
- (crowd shouting)
- (overlapping chatter)

97
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,671
LAMPLEY:
Round ten about to begin.

98
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,939
(bell clangs twice)

99
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,974
(crowd chatter, jeering)

100
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,045
Watch that jab, watch the jab.

101
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:22,416
LAMPLEY: Billy Hope still
with that bleeding left eye.

102
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,887
Those who love him would say,
"Defense? What is that?"

103
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,355
- And a hard right cross!
- Yeah, Hope hurt him!

104
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,090
That's it, baby,
that's it.

105
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,859
LAMPLEY:
Good body shot by Darius Jones.

106
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,427
Giving Hope
a little of his medicine,

107
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,295
he comes back to the body
a second time.

108
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,130
JONES JR.: He hurt Hope
with that body shot.

109
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,332
LAMPLEY: Hard right by Hope
drives Jones

110
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,134
back into the ropes.

111
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,903
REFEREE:
Let him go. Let him go.

112
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,505
LAMPLEY: That's one
of the best clean shots

113
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,174
Hope has landed
since the middle of the fight.

114
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,543
And down goes Jones
on a left hook.

115
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,311
REFEREE:
Three...

116
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,181
- four, five...
- Tremendous turnaround

117
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,316
in favor of Hope,
here in round ten.

118
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,819
- Come to me, come to me.
- JONES JR.: Wow, what a shot!

119
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,754
ELI: You stay on him, Billy,
stay on him.

120
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,890
- Are you good? You good? All right.
- I'm good. I'm good.

121
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,458
LAMPLEY: Tony Weeks is
gonna let him keep fighting.

122
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:06,359
- JONES JR.: Oh!
- LAMPLEY: But not for long!

123
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:11,064
And another right hand
may have ended the fight.

124
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,366
- (cheering continues)
- ...six, seven...

125
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,502
eight...

126
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,969
nine...

127
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,505
- That's it.
- (bell clanging)

128
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,140
LAMPLEY:
This is over!

129
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,643
A comeback knockout win
for Billy Hope.

130
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,846
JONES JR.: I told you, Jim,
as long as there's a Billy,

131
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,482
there is Hope...
He always has a chance.

132
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:30,217
LAMPLEY: So light heavyweight
champ Billy Hope

133
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,620
has a fourth consecutive
title defense

134
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,055
in Madison Square Garden.

135
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,024
Let's go to David Diamante

136

for the official particulars
on the KO.

137
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,696
Ladies and gentlemen, from
the world's most famous arena,

138

Madison Square Garden, the
official time of the stoppage:

139
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:50,437
one minute and 18 seconds
of round number ten.

140
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,773
Your winner by knockout,

141
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,308

Billy "The Great" Hope!

146
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,630
JONES JR.: He reminds us of the
great, late Matthew Saad Muhammad.

147
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:20,801
Just when you think there's no
hope left, here comes Billy.

148
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,537
LAMPLEY: From an orphanage
in Hell's Kitchen

149
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:27,775
to a professional career fighting
in Madison Square Garden

150
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:33,180
is a distance of only a few blocks...
and a million miles.

151
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,283
But it's a journey Billy Hope
has made in his life.

take the belts out for
the press conference, yeah?

158
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,536
- The new one?
- With the other ones in the back of the car.

159
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,505
Yo, I'll bring that, Mikey.
You bring that one.

160
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,074
- See you at the press conference.
- Come on, Big Mike.

161
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:04,311
- We got a press conference.
- All right, we'll see you there.

162
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,714
(door closes)

163
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,115
Thanks, Eli.

164
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,594
Hey.

165
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,562
- No.
- I don't know what that is...

166
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,331
- Come here.
- I'm bleeding out of my mouth, baby.

167
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,766
I don't know
when it's coming clean.

168
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,500
What's that, baby?

169
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,036
(Billy sighs)

170
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,439
- What'd you say?
- It's fine, babe.

171
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,874
You want some water?

172
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,309
Yeah. I'm just gonna
take a shower first.

173
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,011
No, no, no.

174
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,546
Can you get
your socks off?

175
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,014
Yourself?

176
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,416
Yeah. I'll just fuckin'
shower in 'em.

177
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,223
(faucet squeaks,
shower water running)

178
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,365
- (reporters clamoring)
- Billy!

179
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,101
- BILLY: Okay, Mike, go ahead.
- Billy, most of us here

180
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,870
had you winning this early.

181
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,638
Were you expecting
such a difficult fight?

182
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:07,374
Oh. Heh.
Yeah, I don't know, "expect"?

183
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,743
I don't know.
You can't expect anything.

184
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:13,380
Um, I-I was really looking
forward to just showing up,

185
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,949
walk in the ring, and then
having him fall on the ground.

186
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,818
(laughter, scattered applause)

187
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,552
- REPORTER: Billy. Hey, Billy.
- (reporters shouting)

188
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,388
No, man, I mean...

189
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,391
I expected a hard fight.
You know? Um...

190
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,760
I put my family
through a lot. Uh...

191
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,395
by the way, Leila,

192
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,030
if you're watching,
go to sleep, baby.

193
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,999
(laughter)

194
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,034
Billy. Hey, Billy, Billy.

195
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:38,471
Billy. You're 43 and 0... undefeated.
Are you running out of legitimate...

196
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,674
BILLY:
Sorry, can you say that again?

197
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,210
- (whooping, cheering)
- It's impressive.

198
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,412
But who are you gonna fight?
Who are you gonna fight?

199
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,815
- Uh, you know, that's really Jordan and me...
- MIGUEL: I think I know one!

200
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,482
- Me!
- (crowd murmuring)

201
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,621
I mean, all the fans around the
world, they want to see it.

202
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,390
Y'all tell me, who else is there?
Your crew knows it.

203
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,559
All these beautiful people
in here know it.

204
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:03,463
I know it. I just want to know
why you won't give me my shot.

205
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,232
All I want is my shot.
I just want my shot.

206
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,367
MAUREEN: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Who are you?

207
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,803
You know exactly
who I am, baby.

208
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,472
- He's just trying to make a fight.
- And you're that contender?

209
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,441
You ain't never been hit
by a real man.

210
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,209
- (crowd oohing)
- All right?

211
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:19,179
Who's got that...
(speaking Spanish)

212
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,515
It's pretty clear that he hasn't
really been hit at all yet, huh?

213
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,684
- (laughter)
- What are you drinking in that cup, man?

214
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,286
Hey, you know what?
You ain't no champ.

215
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,221
You're all show
and you know that.

216
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,057
Why you so scared
to fight me, Billy?

217
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,225
We all came and gave
a good show tonight,

218
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,729
didn't we, Jordan? Yeah? And I'm pretty
sure we did business, didn't we?

219
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:38,298
Yeah, all right.
Y'all have a good night, okay?

220
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,834
MIGUEL:
Sign the contract, baby!

221
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,570
- Gonna be a fight, Billy?
- Just sign the contract, baby!

222
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,305
REPORTER:
Is there going to be a fight?

223
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,707
- I want you to line it up!
- Line it up?

224
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,142
Miguel's just
showboating, Billy.

225
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,078
I'm gonna shut him the fuck up.

226
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,280
Line it up.

227
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,382
Turay just makes sense.
If it makes money,

228
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,150
it makes sense. Two for the
bills, one for the belt.

229
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,119
The Turay fight
makes better sense.

230
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,288
No, no, no. You think
Miguel's a better fighter?

231
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,356
No. I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.

232
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,558
What do I got to do? What do
I got to do, say it again?

233
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,627
- You want me to say it again?
- You want to fight me?

234
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,430
Do you want to say it again?
What do you want me to do?

235
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,799
Why do you do this
in front of all...

236
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,967
(yells angrily)

237
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,668
- MAN: What happened?
- (excited chatter)

238
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,906
- What's the problem, Billy?
- Hey, yo, yo, I'm sorry.

239
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,508
I'm sorry about that.

240
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,276
- I'll just...
- Don't worry about it. Go on.

241
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,745
- Just, come on, man.
- Don't worry about this.

242
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,219
(lively chatter, horns honking)

243
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,135
BILLY (voice-over): I want
to get you out of this dress.

244
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,371
Yeah, me, too.
You have no idea.

245
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,839
Hey, Lee,
put those in the office.

246
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,841
- MAUREEN: Ugh!
- Come on. Come with me.

247
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,577
- Come with me. Where you going?
- (laughs): What?

248
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,913
- Come with me.
- Let me put my stuff down.

249
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,347
I got to get
you some ice...

250
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,883
- Leila?
- And some food...

251
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,284
Leila?

252
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,785
Hey, hey. Shh.

253
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,353
She might be sleeping.

254
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,055
- Leila...
- GLORIA: Hey.

255
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,024
- How's it going, Gloria?
- Congratulations, Mr. Billy.

256
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,725
Is she up? Is she up?

257
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,295
Yeah, she's probably
still waiting up for you.

258
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,763
Tell me she didn't
watch that fight.

259
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,570
Oh, I saw you.

260
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:58,805
I saw you.

261
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,540
Don't try and fool me.

262
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,176
- I'm coming for my hug.
- (fake snoring)

263
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,744
(laughs)

264
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,179
Hey, wake up.

265
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,515
- Aw! You... Yeah... Oh.
- (Leila laughs)

266
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,150
Hi, baby.

267
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,020
Oh, I missed you so much.

268
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,422
I missed you, Daddy.

269
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,927
Can I count?

270
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,394
Mm-hmm.

271
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,833
That's a big one.

272
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,135
Yeah.

273
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,770
BILLY:
Mm.

274
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,841
Eight.

275
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,176
Mm.

276
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,478
- You got hit a lot, Dad.
- Yeah,

277
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,779
you should see the other guy.

278
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,214
No, she should not.

279
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,715
- BILLY: Aw.
- She needs to go to bed.

280
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,451
- And so do you. Come on.
- (pats Billy)

281
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,653
- Party's over. Come on.
- (Billy laughing)

282
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,721
Why can't I go
see the fights?

283
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,323
Oh, 'cause your mother
thinks they're too...

284
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,025
Why can't she go
to your fights?

285
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,161
Your mom thinks they're
too violent, baby, come on.

286
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,329
But I see stuff like that
on TV all the time.

287
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,165
- I know you do.
- MAUREEN: What do you mean?

288
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,632
I watch "The Walking Dead"
with Gloria.

289
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,334
All right,
that's gonna stop.

290
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,170
You, up. Come on,
this is your hint.

291
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,505
- Okay, all right.
- MAUREEN: Come on.

292
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,207
Time for bed.
Please... no...

293
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,641
- Dad will let me.
- She has a phone?

294
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,310
She's had a phone
for two months.

295
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,911
Why are you looking at me
like I'm crazy?

296
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,846
'Cause you asked me
to get her the phone?

297
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,415
- Get a ten-year-old a phone?
- Out, out, out.

298
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,883
Do you have
the pass code on it?

299
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,518
Dad would say yes.

300
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,521
Well, sometimes I think
your daddy confuses you

301
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,491
with the other children who
hang around him night and day.

302
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,159
You're talking
about Mikey and Jon Jon, right?

303
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,660
That's right, baby.

304
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,229
Mm... (kisses)
I love you so much.

305
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,363
I'm serious.

306
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,165
Okay. Come on. Bedtime.

307
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,933
BILLY: Hey, get away
from my daughter.

308
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,502
You, get out.
Get out.

309
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,104
LEILA (laughs):
Go away, Dad.

310
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,173
- (Billy and Leila laugh)
- MAUREEN: Good night.

311
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,009
- BILLY: Hmm?
- Hmm?

312
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,710
What would you like?

313
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:47,347
I want...
I want to take a break.

314
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,018
I was just thinking we could
maybe blow off the Turay match,

315
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,353
rethink things, pick a fight

316
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:56,556
- for later next year, you know.
- Wait a minute.

317
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,957
Why?

318
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,993
I didn't like
what I saw tonight.

319
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,929
What did you see tonight?
You saw me win tonight.

320
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,331
Baby, look at your face.

321
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,632
What are you talking about?

322
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,269
Look at your face.

323
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,939
Baby, what are you saying?

324
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,607
(sniffles)

325
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,543
Hey, baby,
can I ask you something?

326
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,445
- What?
- What if I said this...

327
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,547
"Look at your face.
Look at your face,"

328
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,316
and then I started
crying? Okay?

329
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,784
(Maureen sniffles)

330
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,053
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,520
Nah, it's-it's all good.

332
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,022
- I'm sorry, but...
- It's good.

333
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,423
...you fucking scared me.

334
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,225
You can't fight
like that anymore.

335
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,027
Baby, we... we won tonight.

336
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,929
Yeah, but it's the way
you're fighting.

337
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,034
- What are you talking about?
- Oh...

338
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,771
The way I fight
bought us this house

339
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,839
and bought you that
fucking beautiful dress.

340
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,375
Yes, I know. I know.

341
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,110
And it gave Leila
that fucking private school.

342
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,545
- I know, baby. I know.
- All the shit in this house.

343
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,547
Our fucking life,
that's what my fighting bought.

344
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,283
But I want to enjoy it.

345
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,318
- Where is this coming from?
- With you.

346
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,622
(sighs)

347
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,525
This is the talk you have when
you lose, not when you win.

348
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,596
The more you get hit,
the harder you fight. I get it.

349
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,064
I don't want to hear
this right now.

350
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,932
Only now you're taking
way too many hits

351
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,934
- before you get off.
- Hey. Listen to me.

352
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,536
This was a good night...

353
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,372
I love you.
You are all I care about.

354
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,174
The three of us, that's it.

355
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,575
That's all that matters.

356
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,211
So I'm going to tell you
the truth.

357
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,147
You're going to be punch-drunk
in two years

358
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,048
if you keep this up.

359
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,521
Think about her.

360
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,490
When she graduates,
what do you want to look like?

361
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,694
(sighs) Fuck me.

362
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,363
Fuck.

363
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,734
(sighs)
Why do you got to lay

364
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,802
the fucking truth right now?

365
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,838
Fuck.

366
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,640
You say it,
I'll do it, all right?

367
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,708
You say it, I'll do it.

368
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,548
Come here, baby.

369
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,651
They're all gonna keep you in that
"Billy the Great" bubble, you know?

370
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,453
And they'll take
their pound of flesh,

371
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,222
but, baby, when
that bubble pops,

372
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:13,260
they're all just gonna
scatter like roaches.

373
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:17,230
And me and Leila are gonna
be here to pick up the pieces.

374
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,399
There are no pieces.

375
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,638
MAUREEN:
I know.

376
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,641
Hey, you know what?

377
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,477
- What?
- I wanna know...

378
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,745
- you know how I only went ten rounds?
- What's that?

379
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,249
I only went ten rounds tonight,
so do you know what that means?

380
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,785
Mmm... what does that mean?

381
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,821
That means that I still have...

382
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,459
...two rounds left in me.

383
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:47,994
MAUREEN:
Oh.

384
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,730
You want to go two rounds
with me, champ?

385
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:51,598
Mm-hmm.

386
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,900
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,102
- That's very impressive.
- Mmm.

388
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,271
Very brave.

389
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,539
(Billy chuckles)

390
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,442
(Maureen moaning softly)

391
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,978
- Good.
- (laughing): Good.

392
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,414
Wow.

393
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,860
(sighs)

394
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,130
(coughing)

395
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,466
Oh, fuck. Baby.

396
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,867
Ow... (sighs)

397
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,538
(quietly):
Fuck...

398
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,477
(groaning)

399
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,555
(quiet laugh)

400
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,057
(chuckles)

401
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,195
(sighs)

402
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:59,232
(groaning)

403
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,109
Uncle J, watch!

404
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,146
That's another gold medal
in your future, missy.

405
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,283
- Flip a little higher.
- No, no, no!

406
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,418
No. No, no, no... no flips.

407
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,786
Not too high, baby.

408
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,654
- Yeah, she's good.
- Heh heh.

409
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:25,825
Oh, I got, uh,
got a few things for you.

410
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,794
I put that together
for the people over at HBO.

411
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,896
It's a two-year,
three-fight deal.

412
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,063
Mm-hmm.

413
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,132
Hey, whoever wins...

414
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,501
whoever wins...

415
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,235
(laughter)

416
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,406
- ...gets one of these.
- JON JON: Again with the gifts?

417
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,773
How much you spend
on this shit?

418
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,442
Oh, shit, you all just won.

419
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,043
Oh, yo, I owe some shit
to the government.

420
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,912
Let me hock this shit.
Nah, just playing.

421
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,614
Yo, is this the shit
with the bezel right here?

422
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,248
Yo, this shit with the bezel?

423
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,917
Yeah, Gabe, it got the bezel
just like the last deal.

424
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,719
Ooh! Oh, this shit
got the bezel on it.

425
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,454
You don't got these shits
in, like, big-boy sizes?

426
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,656
- I win, you win. All right?
- That's too much.

427
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,791
It's not gonna happen.

428
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,693
Maureen, Billy's been
my fighter for ten years.

429
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,695
I know what's best for him.

430
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,564
And I've been his wife
for, like, a hundred.

431
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,265
I know what's better for him.

432
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,134
Come on, he needs time off.

433
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,202
To do what? Sit on a beach
and watch the sun go down?

434
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,505
- Yeah.
- How long he gonna do that, Mo?

435
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,075
One week? Two weeks? Then he's
gonna start looking around.

436
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,010
He'll fuck around
and bite his hand off

437
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,512
if you don't give him something
else to do with them.

438
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,180
(laughing):
Are you...

439
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,715
Are you hustling me?

440
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,451
We've been friends a long time.

441
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,854
Look at this. He didn't have
to pay me a dime for this.

442
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,856
You know, all of the
fighters is coming to me

443
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,858
and coming to me because of
my relationship with Billy.

444
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,760
- 'Cause we family, Mo.
- I know.

445
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,595
- LEILA: Daddy!
- JORDAN: Oh, man,

446
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,964
we was talking about you
like a dog, champ.

447
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:41,033
You should've heard the things Maureen was
saying about you. I said, "The champ?

448
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,602
Never!"

449
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,971
- Daddy, come jump with me!
- BILLY: Okay.

450
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,474
- (Jordan laughing)
- BILLY: You okay?

451
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,609
Yeah. How you doing?

452
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,944
- Took me too long to get here.
- You okay?

453
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,880
- Don't look at me like that.
- You been icing?

454
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,248
- Look, Billy, I told Maureen...
- Yeah?

455
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,352
I got HBO to commit
to $30 million.

456
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:00,787
Ten million per fight.

457
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,655
I just told you,
we're passing on Turay.

458
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:04,391
BILLY:
Yeah, man.

459
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,158
Daddy, come on!

460
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,461
Make sure she doesn't
break her neck.

461
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,862
(Jordan chuckles)

462
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,632
- He's laughing.
- JORDAN: Oh, boy.

463
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,568
- LEILA: Come on.
- BILLY: I'm coming.

464
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:18,304
(crickets chirping)

465
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,775
"I just want to thank everybody
from the Children's Club

466
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,711
"'cause this place
saved my life.

467
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,879
"I grew up in the system.

468
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:30,216
My mother had me when she
was incarcerated."

469
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,519
That... How do you spell
"incarcerated"?

470
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,121
- You should say "in jail."
- MAUREEN: I-N-C-A-R-C-E-R...

471
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,524
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter, babe.

472
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,460
"I got dumped into
foster care the..."

473
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,695
(sighs) I don't want to do this.
I can't do this.

474
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:46,132
- (mutters) - Hey, hey, come on.
It's okay, come here.

475
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,234
- I don't want -to talk about this.
- What? What do you mean?

476
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,603
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't need to stand up there

477
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,939
in front of a whole group of people
and tell them my fucking life story.

478
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,142
- I don't want to tell them.
- Stop, you're acting crazy. It's okay.

479
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,077
BILLY: No, they're gonna
look at me like I'm an idiot.

480
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,079
No, they love you.
Those kids love you.

481
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,748
And it's for them.
It's a charity, baby.

482
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,283
Don't be nervous.
You're fine. Okay?

483
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,818
Okay?

484
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,687
- Put your pants on.
- (Billy chuckles)

485
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,856
Let's go,
so we can get home, okay?

486
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,891
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

487
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,125
(Billy chuckling)

488
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,296
BILLY:
Hey, Leila.

489
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,534
I'm gonna tell you something.

490
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,969
And it is very important.

491
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,371
Okay? I want you to listen.

492
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,539
- I love you.
- I...

493
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,040
- I love you.
- (laughing)

494
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,442
LEILA:
So predictable.

495
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,443
Man.

496
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,344
(laughter)

497
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,714
ANNOUNCER (voice-over):
The Children's Club of New York

498
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,348
would like to welcome

499
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,984
the Light Heavyweight Champion
of the world,

500
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,686

501
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,288
(cameras clicking)

502
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:48,127
Uh, um...

503
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,629
All right, all right,
all right.

504
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,230
I'd rather take
a couple punches

505
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,265
than be up, be up here,
but, um...

506
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,268
(exhales sharply)

507
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,378
Well, I wouldn't be
up here tonight,

508
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:10,349
uh, if it wasn't for the...
for... for the Children's Club.

509
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,151
They gave me a bed.

510
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,854
They gave me
my first pair of gloves.

511
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,389
Some gloves...
You know, smelly, ratty and...

512
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,892
all tattered.

513
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,794
They were mine.

514
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,663
You know?

515
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,065
You got your soul
in those gloves.

516
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,100
- (utensils clatter)
- (quietly): Hey, hey, hey,

517
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,169
- They gave me a home.
- Hector, chill out.

518
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,072
Uh...
I met my boys.

519
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,207
- (cheering)
- That whole table,

520
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,544
- I would stay away from 'em if I was you.
- GABE: Billy!

521
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,345
Behave yourself... there are
a lot of rich people here.

522
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,380
(laughter)

523
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,715
Um...

524
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:44,183
when I was...

525
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,218
when I was...
when I was 12 years old,

526
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:48,054
there was this little girl.

527
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,958
She was skinny.
She had ratty hair.

528
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,562
She had been through it.
She stuck with me

529
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:59,632
when I was, uh, um...
was incarcerated.

530
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,033
(chuckles)
A couple times.

531
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,735
(scattered laughter)

532
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:06,539
And I knew she was there.
I wouldn't be here

533
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,407
without my wife Maureen.

534
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,543
(applause, shouts)

535
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,219
Now, you, with your fancy cars

536
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,088
and... or your fancy dresses

537
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,891
and your-your fancy suits

538
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,827
and your beautiful hair,

539
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,461
take some of that money and...

540
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:33,099
and give it, give it...
give us that shit.

541
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,902
- All right.
- (applause)

542
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,805
- (man shouts enthusiastically)
- (whistling)

543
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,578
(lively, overlapping
conversations)

544
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:48,480
Swagger? No, I got pizzazz.
That's a level above swagger.

545
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,382
(laughing):
That's that new shit.

546
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,318
Come on, everybody tired
of that old shit, man.

547
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,721
Miguel, Miguel. Bitch boy.
Here he comes.

548
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,422
MIGUEL:
Speaking of old shit.

549
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:57,790
Watch this.

550
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,291
Hey, Billy,
why you leaving so soon?

551
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,628
Come on, baby, let's go.

552
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:03,930
I hope you're not taking everything
personal. I'm just trying to sell a fight.

553
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:06,365
- Get the fuck off me, man.
- Don't give him any press.

554
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,534
What, I got to fuck your
bitch to talk to you?

555
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,470
Billy, let that go. Come on, keep walking.
Come on. Let's go.

556
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,073
How about this? I'll take your
bitch, then I'll take your belt.

557
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,308
Just let it go.
Baby...

558
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,344
- How about I take your belt...
- Let's go home.

559
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,512
- ...then I take your bitch?
- Let it go. Baby.

560
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,881
There he is. There he is.

561
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,215
Let's go home.
Walk away.

562
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,618
Stop it. Stop. Billy.
(grunts)

563
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:28,254
- MAUREEN: Billy...
- I'll take your belt, bitch.

564
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,422
- (onlookers exclaiming)
- MAUREEN: Billy!

565
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,224
- Stop it! Stop!
- Get out of the way, Mo!

566
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,261
(onlookers clamoring)

567
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,731
MAUREEN:
Billy! Billy!

568
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,199
(grunting)

569
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,071
Bitch-ass nigga!

570
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:49,942
Billy, stop!

571
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,744
- Stop it!
- (gunshot)

572
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,245
(people screaming, shouting)

573
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,281
Fuckin' little bitch!

574
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,516
GABE:
Get the fuck off me!

575
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,419
- I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
- Bitch-ass motherfucker!

576
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,022
It wasn't me, man!
He shot my...

577
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,024
(woman screaming)

578
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,393
Huh? Huh?

579
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:08,594
MAUREEN:
Billy?

580
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,629
- Hey, hey. Hey, what's up?
- Billy?

581
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,164
What's up, baby?

582
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:14,366
- (panting)
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

583
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,168
- What?
- I don't know.

584
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:17,804
- What happened?
- Something happened.

585
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:20,139
Hey, I don't know what to do.

586
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,141
- Am I okay?
- Yeah, yeah, you're okay.

587
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,642
Fuck. Fuck, baby.

588
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,578
Okay. Okay. What do I do?
Do I lie her down?

589
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,614
Do I lie her down?
I don't know what to do.

590
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,049
- JORDAN: Go get some help!
- SECURITY GUARD: Okay.

591
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,251
Hey, call 911, man! Come on!

595
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,960
Hector did that shit!
It wasn't me! Get off me!

596
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,594
Hector, what the fuck

597
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,630
What are you fucking
thinking, man?!

598
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,132
MAN:
Get a doctor here!

Okay, okay, okay.

605
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,948
Hey, look at me, look at me

606
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,883
Look at me

Look me in the eye,

609
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,790
It's not that bad.
It's not that bad, baby.

610
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,291
- It's not that bad.
- (moans)

611
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,927
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. No, no.

612
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:16,729
- Just... that's a little blood.

There you go.
Cradled in your arms.

Wait, baby, wait.

- Shit...

640
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,491
MAN: Is there a doctor here?

641
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:20,726
Doctor?!

642
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,097
We need a doctor!
We need a doctor!

DETECTIVE: We're sorry
to hear about your loss.

DETECTIVE 2: We're gonna try
to make this

647
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,351
as, uh, simple and easy
as possible.

648
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:47,954
We need an eyewitness
to identify the shooter.

649
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:50,622
No one's talking or they don't
want to be involved.

650
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:53,759
- Do you remember anything?
- What... what time is it?

651
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,628
It's 6:00 a.m. We know it's
been a long night for you,

652
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,364
but we got to ask
these questions.

653
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,132
The housekeeper's there
with my, um,

654
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,968
with my daughter, so I...
Can I just...?

655
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,469
Uh, I can't find my phone.

656
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,471
We just need another
moment of your time.

657
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:08,440
Uh, one of your crew, uh,
had a weapon on him.

658
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,376
He said he was
your security detail.

659
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,811
Unfortunately, he didn't
have a permit to carry.

660
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,047
My daughter wakes up at 6:00.

661
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:16,883
Okay.

662
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,051
I tell you what, Mr. Hope.

663
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,087
Uh, if, uh,
you can remember

664
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,255
anything, anything at all,
like we said, sir,

665
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,324
don't hesitate
to give us a call.

666

00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:46,097
So... pay them.

779
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,834
- With what?
- With my fucking money, Simon.

780
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,469
That's why I'm here, Billy.

781
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,070
The money,
it's drying up.

782
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,806
Look, you gotta see
what's happening here.

783
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,708
Um, you need to cut back.

784
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,477
I mean, they've already
taken two of the cars.

785
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,947
- What's it about, man?
- It... it's real simple.

786
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,316
What's it about,
you-you taking my money?

787
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,784
What?

788
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,787
- You stealing from me, Simon?
- No.

789
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,457
I'm-I'm just here
to help out.

790
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,692
- I can take care of this if you want me to.
- Please.

791
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,927
- JORDAN: This is fine.
- (Billy scoffs)

792
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,629
- You can give me that and...
- Okay.

793
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:18,897
You can leave this with me.

794
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,399
I'll take care of it.

795
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,267
SIMON:
Okay.

796
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,205
Billy, I just want to say
I'm really sorry.

797
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,241
- About everything.
- (Billy scoffs)

798
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,179
- Hey, look, Billy.
- (door opens)

799
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,847
You need this.

800
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,983
- (door closes)
- This solves all your problems.

801
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,352
- What is that?
- It's the contract.

802
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:43,221
To fight Turay.
Look, I'm not gonna pretend

803
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,156
I... I know the pain
you're going through.

804
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,958
But I do know for you
to get through it,

805
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,660
you're gonna have
to get back in that ring.

806
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,061
No, Mo doesn't want me
to sign that.

807
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:51,897
No, Mo didn't want you
to sign it then.

808
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,832
Now she would want you
to actually sign the contract.

809
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,200
Why you say that?

810
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:56,902
Billy, every time
I seen you fight,

811
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,837
you climb in there alone.

812
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,473
Every time you bled,
you bled your blood.

813
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,308
When you sat down on that stool
and it felt like death

814
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,544
and you thought you couldn't
get up, but you got up?

815
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,379
You did that.

816
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:10,482
You need to get back
to that.

817
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:13,018
You want Leila to grow up
the way you grew up?

818
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,887
You want her in the streets?

819
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:17,956
It's a three-fight deal, Billy.

820
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,958
Got to get back to doing
what we do, man.

821
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:23,729
When you're in the ring, you're gonna
feel different. I'm telling you.

822
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,263
(sniffles)

823
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,766
It's not about
contracts, right?

824
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,502
It's about family.

825
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:32,176
I don't know what I'd do
without you, man.

826
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,039
You ain't gotta worry
about that, man.

827
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,776
(signing)

828
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,651
(crowd cheering, blows thudding)

829
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:52,157
COMMENTATOR: Nobody would've
expected Kalil Turay

830
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,361
to have his way throughout
the fight against Billy Hope.

831
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,964
ELI: Billy, put them goddamn
hands up now!

832
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:01,299
COMMENTATOR:
Hope fighting in the wake

833
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,569
- of his wife's unexpected death.
- Get off that rope!

834
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,270
COMMENTATOR:
No aggression...

835
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:08,674
simply a will to continue
taking punishment...

836
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:09,875
Get off them goddamn ropes!

837
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,510
...and to allow Turay

838
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,745
to pound him with both fists

839
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,180
to the body and the head.

840
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,583
- Ending it, now!
- (grunting)

841
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:21,853
But it's been a bloodletting
from the first bell onward.

842
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:25,023
- (crowd cheering)
- Yes!

843
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,392
- Hope finally gets in a right hand.
- (bell clanging)

844
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,795
- (crowd booing) - Those have
been few and far between.

845
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,763
- By and large,
- Control your fighter!

846
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:37,135
It was a beat-down by Kalil
Turay, who appears to have scored

847
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,472
an upset victory
over Billy Hope

848
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:43,408
and perhaps has put
the finishing touches

849
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,276
on Hope's great career.

850
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,013
Focus, you hear me?
Huh? Billy, listen to me, man.

851
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,415
I'm not gonna watch this. I'm not
gonna watch this happen to you, man.

852
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,117
I'm not gonna watch
this happen to us.

853
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,785
Billy, if you don't
show me something here,

854
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,220
I'm gonna call it.
That's it. You hear me?

855
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,055
We're done.
Wake up, champ.

856
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,357
Don't call it, man.
No, don't call it.

857
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,126
What the fuck
are we doing here, huh?

858
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,761
I gotta end
this shit, Billy.

859
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,530
(distantly):
You hear me?

860
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,798
I'm not gonna watch this shit
happen to you, man, all right?

861
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:08,366
Remember when we were done,

862
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,235
when we were done,
you used to fight?

863
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,504
Like, get up, get up.
Let's go.

864
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:14,439
Come on, champ.
Let's go.

865
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,143
He keep looking
out the ring for Maureen.

866
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,445
He's losing
his fucking mind, bro.

867
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,515
REFEREE:
Seconds out.

868
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:24,950
This guy is done.

869
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,718
He's not the champ anymore.
Finish him.

870
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:29,621
Hands up. Fight back.
Focus. Come on.

871
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,422
REFEREE:
Corner ready?

872
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,462
(crowd cheering distantly)

873
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,230
(bell clangs twice)

874
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,169
- (panting)
- (crowd shouting)

875
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,349
(cheering)

876
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:00,518
Get the damn hands up,
Billy! Now!

877
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,888
(grunting)

878
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,162
- (groaning, exclaiming)
- Oh, man!

879
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,537
(cheering)

880
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:22,774
COMMENTATOR: Billy Hope has
refused to compete here tonight.

881
00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:24,409
(shouting)
...fuck you!

882
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:27,679
- (bell clanging)
- Another giant shot from Turay

883
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,615
and the referee
is gonna stop it.

884
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:31,549
- It's gonna be the end of that.
- REFEREE: It's over.

885
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,218
No, don't call it.
No, don't call it.

886
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,986
- REFEREE: That's it, it's over.
- No...!

887
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,988
COMMENTATOR:
And Hope headbutts the referee!

888
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:39,224
(crowd clamoring, booing)

889
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:42,527
COMMENTATOR: A horrible moment
as a final postscript

890
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,064
to what has been a horrible
night for Billy Hope,

891
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,099
and a career which produced
so many thrills...

892
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:51,469
- BILLY: I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- ...and so much joyous glory,

893
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:56,675
appears to have ended
ignominiously here tonight.

894
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:59,177
(water trickling in shower)

895
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:03,581
(Billy crying quietly)

896
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,196
Eli?

897
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:24,402
Eli?

898
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,206
Is Jordan here?

899
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:43,188
Is anybody still here?

900
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,994
JORDAN (voice-over):
You headbutt a referee, man.

901
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:50,862
What the fuck kind of shit
was that, man?

902
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:54,632
Broke his nose. Shattered his
motherfucking cheekbone.

903
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,567
What got into you, man?

904
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:59,671
We did the biggest deal
that we ever did, Billy,

905
00:43:59,705 --> 00:44:01,707
and you fucked it off, man.

906
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,509
It'll be a year before your
suspension is up for review,

907
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:07,212
which means zero income. The fine
for the assault on the referee

908
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,414
will be in the six figures.
He's suing you

909
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,582
for lost wages
and emotional trauma.

910
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,985
They're freezing all your
bank accounts immediately,

911
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:17,088
and to top that off the networks are
suing us for breach of contract, man.

912
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:19,124
Listen...

913
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:22,060
you're gonna have to sell the
house to cover the debt.

914
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:25,697
No, I don't wanna sell the house, man.
I'm not selling the house.

915
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:28,366
- That's Leila's home.
- You don't have a choice, Billy.

916
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,269
If you don't, it's gonna
get repossessed anyway.

917
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,238
- This is some serious shit.
- No, no, no.

918
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:36,742
I'll just train with Eli and then
we'll get ready for the next fight.

919
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:39,310
I'm not even sure trainers
will take you on right now.

920
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,346
What? I don't need another trainer.
I can just use...

921
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:43,681
Eli's working
with another fighter.

922
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:46,417
- Who? Who is he? Who is he?
- Miguel Escobar.

923
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:49,788
- Are you working with him, too?
- Yeah.

924
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:52,323
Billy, you know if
it makes money, it makes sense.

925
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:56,461
- Oh, you...
- It's just business, Billy.

926
00:44:56,494 --> 00:45:00,131
I know you miss Maureen.
I miss Maureen, too, man.

927
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:03,168
Shit, if she was here, she'd
be disgusted with you, man.

928
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,837
We need you to pull yourself together.
You need help, Billy.

929
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:08,039
Don't talk about

We're ready to begin.

The matter this morning
is provisional custody

of Leila Rae Hope, a minor...

1003

- When can I get her out?
- Don't interrupt, Mr. Hope.

The child has no other
family, is that right?

Uh, no, Your Honor.
Uh, both my client

00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,688
and his wife came up
through the system.

1007

So that's why

these circumstances are a little
bit more painful for you.

I'm her father.

that's not enough.

This court is aware of
the tragedy

1012
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:06,237
your family
has suffered, Mr. Hope.

1013
00:50:06,271 --> 00:50:07,972
Nonetheless,
you have chosen

1014
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,841
to demonstrate alarming
and dangerous behaviors,

1015
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,344
while having
custody of your daughter.

Loaded weapons,
alcohol, violence...

1017
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,086
Mr. Hope will follow a case plan
that the court has designed.

1018
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,954
Said plan will include
individual counseling,

1019
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:27,125
as well as sobriety
and anger management classes.

1020
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:32,029
And I order said child remanded into
the care of the Family Services,

1021
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,465
until which time
the father can demonstrate

1022
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:37,602
the abilities to perform duties
of a responsible parent.

30 days?

- 30 days is bullshit, man.

I don't know that?

I remember that-that,
you know...

1115
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,516
that was one hell of a fight,
you know?

Excuse me,

And I do remember...
You won the fight.

You got the decision.
Don't you remember?

Yeah, I won that fight. I think
Jordan Mains paid it off.

It's the fight game, you know?

How you gonna come in here

I'm just saying
that's why I'm here.

1126

Night Train was the only

I know you were
his trainer, and...

how you train, but...

to throw a punch,

01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:16,133
When can I see my daughter?

1238
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:19,369
And you think I should let you see your
daughter when you're a fuckin' mess?

1239
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:26,043
If I see my daughter, I'll
feel a lot better, all right?

1240
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,012
Will she feel a lot better?

1241
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,780
- Yes.
- Do you feel

1242
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:32,149
in a fit state
to see your daughter today?

1243
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:34,218
You want to help me?
Is that what you want to do?

1244
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,453
- You want to help me?
- I want to help Leila.

1245
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:40,090
That's my first priority.

1246
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:45,095
Hey.

1247
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:48,765
(chuckles)
Hey, baby.

1248
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,604
Hey...

1249
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,509
You okay?

1250
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:03,213
Can you give us a second?

1251
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,715
Leila, would you be
comfortable with that?

1252
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:08,652
- If I stand right over there?
- Sure.

1253
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:10,620
Okay.

1254
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:12,189
All right.

1255
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:14,258
I'm just over here.

1256
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:19,396
What's wrong, baby?

1257
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:21,131
- (sighs)
- Did somebody touch you?

1258
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:22,532
- Somebody hurt you?
- No...

1259
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:24,434
- They put a hand on you?
- No.

1260
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,971
They put a hand on you, baby?
You can tell me.

1261
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:29,173
- Mm-mm.
- Leila...

1262
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:31,408
You talk to me?

1263
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,810
There's nothing to say.

1264
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:35,612
You fucked up.

1265
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,714
Don't use that
language with me.

1266
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:40,584
Or what? You gonna
punish me or something?

1267
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,953
Look, I know that you're
mad at me right now...

1268
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,721
You don't know anything!

1269
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,224
- Hey, hey. Hey, wait, wait...
- Can I go outside now?

1270
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:48,525
Yes, you can.

1271
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,394
- Yes, you can.
- Leila...

1272
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:52,329
- just talk to me.
- Come on, Talia, let's go.

1273
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:54,298
Come on, we got a
couple minutes, baby.

1274
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,966
Is that your dad?

1275
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,834
(sighs)
I don't know anymore.

1276
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:03,073
Leila, will you come...
Leila, will you come back?

1277
01:04:03,107 --> 01:04:05,142
(door closes)

1278

1279
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,852
What you doing here?

1280
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:19,756
Could I buy you a beer?

1281
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:23,827
I don't drink.

1282
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:30,634
I'll take that job.

What's your name?

- Hoppy. (groans)
- What's that from?

1295
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:42,439
My mom liked bunnies, so...

HOPPY:
Man, to think that...

1298
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:49,479
Billy "The Great"
would walk in here.

1299

Just trying to get
some work here, you know?

1300
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:54,684
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

Yeah, if you finish
tying my... tying my shit...

- Oh. I can't say "shit."

1304
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:07,497
Step forward. You're being
too hard on yourself, son.

1305
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,366
You can't learn everything
in one day.

- Yes, sir.

1307
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:15,005
All right?

WOMAN:
Mr. Hope?

1310
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,449
Can I speak to you
for a moment, please?

1311
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,950
What's up?

Yo, is Leila all right?

Where's Leila?

01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:40,297
Uh, she doesn't want
to see you today.

1315
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,399
What do you mean?

1316

She doesn't want

I'm sorry.

1318
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:51,608
But I think we're gonna have
to give her some space

01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:53,477
and respect her wishes.

Yes, she did.

MAN (on TV): ...last night's

by knockout in the fourth round.

1326
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,832
An incredible knockout,

1327

Come on, marry me?

Okay, how about...
let me check my schedule.

I'll get back to you.

1335
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,324
What's up, man?

1336
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:42,992
Thought you said
you didn't drink.

1337
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:45,329
What, you think a man
can't pick up a new habit?

1338
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:47,331
What are you doing here, man?

1339
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:49,266
Seriously, this is my spot.

BILLY:
Can I get a wa... a water?

1341
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,337
Drinking's a solitary sport.

1342
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,305
It's a solitary one.

1343
01:07:55,339 --> 01:07:57,474
I'm just trying to...

1344
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,176
I'm just trying
to connect here, man.

1345
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:02,479
- I just...
- I just didn't want to go home.

1346
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:04,548
300 square feet of...

nothing, you know?

You got plans?

Uh, um, what you mean by that?

1350
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:18,228
You know what you're gonna do with all this
training that you think you so desperately need?

1351
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,896
What you gonna do with it?

1352
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,898
I'm gonna fight, and then
I'm gonna get my kid back.

1353
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,301
Then you're gonna end up
right back here?

- What do you think got you here?

1355
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:30,874
Um, fuck...
some scumbag killed my wife.

What do you think you did...
to be sitting here?

Why...

1358
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,317

all due respect, you know,

1360

I haven't really gotten
much sleep, man.

1362
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:46,990
I don't fucking...
I just told you...

1363
01:08:47,023 --> 01:08:48,358
What did you do?!

1364
01:08:48,392 --> 01:08:49,626
Why you keep asking me

Never mind.

You can't even hear
the question. (chuckles)

Why are you laughing?
What, is this funny to you?

Piece of shit.
Fuck you.

That's what this...

Yo, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

That's okay. We don't need...

Nobody wants your money.

I never really had any plans,

My wife always made
the plans for me.

I broke her heart.

Little kid, man,
she's a little girl.

She's trying to take care

She lost her mother, too.

01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:22,919
so she can feel better
about it, she can get better.

1394
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,788
This ain't
about how you feel.

1395
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:26,189
I mean,

1396
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,694
you got to let her go
through her thing

1397
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:34,598
and not think that thing
is your thing.

1398
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,736
(voice-over):
Then you can deal

1399
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:44,207
with life, like that stuff.

1400
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,610
Life...

1401
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:48,812
boxing, whatever you want.

1402
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,048
(sighs)

1403
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:06,663
(rapid thumping)

1404
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:26,650
Hey, come on. Come here, Hoppy.

1405
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:28,485
Let's go.

1406
01:11:28,518 --> 01:11:30,119
Ready? Jab.

1407
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:31,655
Jab.

1408
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:33,323
Slow it down. Jab.

1409
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:34,591
Yeah, make it accurate.

1410
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:36,793
No pows, power, pop...

1411
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:38,695
No power, no power yet.

1412
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,631
(electronic timer beeping)

1413
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:42,966
What, what, what, what?

1414
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,402
What, what, what,
what, what? Jab.

1415
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:47,437
There you go. That's... Bam!

1416
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:49,806
(shudders, whoops)

1417
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,042
(lock buzzes)

1418
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:57,180
Hey.

1419
01:11:57,213 --> 01:11:58,982
Um... She...

1420
01:11:59,015 --> 01:12:00,684
I don't wanna know...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1421
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:02,619
I know. Um...

1422
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:03,887
She used to sleep with this.

1423
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,955
Would you give that to her?

1424
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,657
- Make sure she gets that?
- Yeah.

1425
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:09,759
I will.

1426
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:11,561
Tell her I love her.

1427
01:12:11,595 --> 01:12:13,630
(lock buzzes)

1428
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:24,207
(siren wails in distance)

1429
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:27,911
We start tomorrow.

1430
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,813
What, like training?

1431
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,348
No, baking cookies.

1432
01:12:32,382 --> 01:12:34,684
I'm going to the bar.

1433
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:36,786
I do not want to see you there.

1434
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,755
Yeah, all right.

1435
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,726
A'ight.

1436
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:44,594
(door closes)

1437
01:12:44,628 --> 01:12:47,130
(chuckles)
Shining so bright.

1438
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:51,801
The way you fight...

1439
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:53,637
anger's your biggest tool.

1440
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:56,740
Fighting angry, that drains you

1441
01:12:56,773 --> 01:12:58,908
twice as fast.

1442
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:05,214
The other guy...
in the ring is your enemy,

1443
01:13:05,248 --> 01:13:08,952
but if all you trying to do
is kill him,

1444
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:10,754
then you expose yourself.

1445
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:13,256
You leave yourself vulnerable.

1446
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:15,191
Got to protect yourself.

1447
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:19,128
Make his mistakes...
be his destruction.

1448
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:21,731
Right now, you got two weapons:

1449
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,900
a shotgun and a grenade.

1450
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:26,736
All power, no precision.

1451
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:29,639
I want you to use
your other arsenal.

1452
01:13:29,673 --> 01:13:31,240
There you go, tap.

1453
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:35,779
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

1454
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:37,714
There you go.

1455
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,282
One, two.

1456
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:40,917
Yeah... one, two, yeah.

1457
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:44,087
(voice-over): Pow, pow, yeah.
Pow, pow, yeah.

1458
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,121
Yeah.

1459
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:47,957
This is what we're gonna do.

1460
01:13:49,693 --> 01:13:51,094
This is the wall, right here.

1461
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:53,797
My back's against the wall.

1462
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,866
It's part of the wall.
Blocking my chin.

1463
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,401
Huh? Shielding yourself.

1464
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,304
A block,
anything that comes that way.

1465
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:04,007
You're right here,
step and slide forward,

1466
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,242
roll...

1467
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,944
just step and slide.

1468
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:09,913
Forward, roll.

1469
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,482
This is the angle,
this is the angle.

1470
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:13,983
All right?

1471
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:15,151
Let's do it real slow.

1472
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,220
Take your time. Let's do it.

1473
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:22,458
My-my wife would've liked you.

1474
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:24,994
I appreciate that.

1475
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:27,797
Let's do this, all right?

1476
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:29,633
I'm serious.

1477
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:31,835
(rapid thumping)

1478
01:14:37,373 --> 01:14:38,842
Good, looking good.

1479
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,777
Good, good.

1480
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,879
Good. Slide it.

1481
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:44,548
Yeah, I hear it now.

1482
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:45,849
Slide it.

1483
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:48,184
Oh, yeah, I hear it now.

1484
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:50,954
Step... step...

1485
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,756
TICK:
Who that is?

1486
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:54,724
See who that is...
There you go, aah!

1487
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:55,959
That's it. Jab.

1488
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,326
Who that hate?

1489
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,262
Who that hate?
Who that hate?

1490
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:00,764
Who that hate?

1491
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,566
Who that hate?
Who that hate?

1492
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:05,134
Drop your hands, Don't even
worry about punching right now.

1493
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,537
Just back against the wall.
Okay? You're doing good.

1494
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:08,838
You're doing good, all right?

1495
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:12,341
Back. See my back? Okay.

1496
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:14,544
Yeah, keep the back
against the wall.

1497
01:15:14,578 --> 01:15:15,912
You feel that?

1498
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:17,046
Remember to slide.

1499
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,615
Keep making him miss...

1500
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:20,283
Keep making him miss.

1501
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:22,285
(voice-over): I'm gonna
introduce you to something

1502
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:26,355
that you never knew before
called defense.

1503
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:27,924
- Hey, Ramone?
- Yes, Coach?

1504
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:30,259
- Come over here.
- I have defense.

1505
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:33,963
Stop punches with your face...
That's not defense.

1506
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:35,932
- I want you to spar with him.
- All right.

1507
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:38,534
- T! Glove him up.
- Like, spar with him?

1508
01:15:38,568 --> 01:15:40,870
Don't worry. He's not gonna
be hitting anything.

1509
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,906
Wait, he's not gonna be hitting anything
or I'm not gonna be hitting anything?

1510
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:46,042
You're not gonna hit nothing.
You work on your defense.

1511
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:48,177
Like, don't hit anything?
Like with my glove?

1512
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:51,948
Don't touch him with your gloves.
Just block.

1513
01:15:51,981 --> 01:15:54,383
(electronic timer beeps)

1514
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:55,819
Hey, champ.

1515
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:57,453
(grunting)

1516
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,555
TICK: Move your feet,
move your feet.

1517
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:02,025
Come on, champ. You got to
turn your body when you block.

1518
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:04,894
You're just covering up.
Pivot out, pivot out.

1519
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:06,963
Step out, step out.

1520
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:08,798
Get some distance so
you can move your head.

1521
01:16:08,832 --> 01:16:11,434
Don't just stand in front of him.
Use your feet.

1522
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:13,402
Get off the rope.

1523
01:16:13,436 --> 01:16:16,205
- (grunting continues)
- Come on, champ.

1524
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:19,008
Let's see you move.

1525
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:20,810
(electronic timer beeps)

1526
01:16:20,844 --> 01:16:23,146
It's like fighting
a fucking gnat!

1527
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:25,114
Taking you out
like a boss, motherfucker.

1528
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:26,616
TICK: I heard that.

1529
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:28,517
And that's 50 for swearing.

1530
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:31,387
(door opens)

1531
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:37,894
How you doing?

1532
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,465
- Hey, Leila.
- Hey, Talia.

1533
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,171
I need help.

1534
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:57,981
Lei, what happened
to your glasses, baby?

1535
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:00,449
They're not cool.

1536
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:01,885
Quiz me.

1537
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:04,253
I may need
the definitions, too.

1538
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:14,330
- Dismantle.
- Dismantle.

M-A-N-T-L-E.

1541
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,468
(chuckles)
You're so smart.

1542
01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:21,337
(sniffles)

1543
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,978

- Gra... gra...
- That's all.

1546
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,532
JUDGE KAYLE (voice-over): Although
I see there has been progress,

1547
01:17:49,565 --> 01:17:52,501
unfortunately, Mr. Hope, legal
custody of the child shall remain

1548
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:55,705
with Family Services
until further evaluation.

1549
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:58,942
Court mandates that
your anger management program

1550
01:17:58,975 --> 01:18:03,880
continue for another 30 days, and
visitation will still be supervised.

1551
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:06,249
30? Another 30,
another 30 days?

1552
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:08,651
JUDGE:
Yes, Mr. Hope.

1553
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,256
You're free to go.

1554
01:18:18,327 --> 01:18:20,096
(sighs)

1555
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,265
It's too early for this.

1556
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:28,337
(grunts)

1557
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,139
Just a sip.

1558
01:18:33,342 --> 01:18:36,045
What were you doing there
in the courtroom today?

1559
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:38,047
Take care
of some parking tickets.

1560
01:18:38,081 --> 01:18:39,749
You don't have a car.

1561
01:18:39,783 --> 01:18:41,584
Jaywalking.

1562
01:18:45,688 --> 01:18:47,957
You all right?
How's your eye?

1563
01:18:47,991 --> 01:18:49,425
Yeah.

1564
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,428
- How's your eye?
- Now you're being smart.

1565
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,297
No, seriously, what's up
with your eye? What is that?

1566
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:57,666
Evil blue-eyed devil
just took it from me.

1567
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,735
You know, the thing with you
is that, like,

1568
01:18:59,769 --> 01:19:02,171
sometimes one eye is,
like, cloudy, right?

1569
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:04,140
And the other one is,
like, sunny.

1570
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:05,775
Like, cloudy, sunny,
cloudy, sunny.

1571
01:19:05,809 --> 01:19:07,076
Close one eye, it's cloudy.

1572
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:08,477
Close the other eye,
it's sunny.

1573
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:10,179
I was fighting Buster Quigley.

1574
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:11,653
Buster Quigley was
a nothing fighter.

1575
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,482
We were in the
middle of a match,

1576
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:16,085
and I was crushing him,
knocking him to the ground.

1577
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:18,121
Out of nowhere, he hit me.

1578
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:19,989
Bam. With a right hand.

1579
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:21,791
I went down,

1580
01:19:21,825 --> 01:19:24,193
my eye went dark.

1581
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:27,831
Doc told me I could
never fight again.

1582
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:29,398
That's too bad.

1583
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:31,634
It was tough today in court.

1584
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:33,469
With your kid.
Sorry about that.

1585
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:36,605
She doesn't want
to see me, anyway, so...

1586
01:19:39,142 --> 01:19:41,845
Don't give up on your kid.

1587
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:45,882
Hey... that story
even true or is that...

1588
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:47,650
- It's a fake eye.
- Yeah?

1589
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:49,986
HMO screwed up,
sent me the wrong color.

1590
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:53,189
It's too much of a hassle
to get them to...

1591
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:55,258
give it back.

1592
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:58,061
I like that blue-eyed
devil story better.

1593
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:01,764
Yeah, me, too.

1594
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:11,574
Hope!

1595
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:15,845
What's up?

1596
01:20:15,879 --> 01:20:17,213
(panting)

1597
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:19,215
- Give me that.
- Yeah.

1598
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:20,416
Yo, thanks, Hop.

1599
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:22,285
Be right back, Hop.

1600
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:26,389
What's up?

1601
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:29,192
Lou, uh, is working with
Keith "The Buzz Saw" Brady.

1602
01:20:29,225 --> 01:20:31,027
Light heavyweight kid,
won the Golden Gloves.

1603
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,428
Yeah, yeah,
I know him, yeah.

1604
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:34,397
TICK: They're working
at Freddy's gym,

1605
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:36,232
and they're doing this,
uh, charity event

1606
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:38,401
for wounded veterans.

1607
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:41,037
And they want to know
if you want to go eight rounds,

1608
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,838
with Brady, for the cause.

1609
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:45,208
Yeah, we think that you'd bring
in a lot of people, big crowd.

1610
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:48,744
Raise a lot of money. It's your
opportunity if you want it, Billy.

1611
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:51,414
You don't need a license
to fight for a charity, so...

1612
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,282
Good seeing you, Tick.

1613
01:20:53,316 --> 01:20:54,817
- Let me know.
- Yeah.

1614
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,370
- Nice meeting you, Billy.
- All right.

1615
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:03,426
What do you think?

1616
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:05,028
It's got one condition.

1617
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:06,896
Better do
what we practiced here.

1618
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:08,631
That's all I ask.

1619
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:11,968
It is kind of nice
to be wanted, yeah?

1620
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:14,803
(chuckles)

1621
01:21:14,837 --> 01:21:16,940
Hey, you know what? Um...

1622
01:21:16,973 --> 01:21:19,909
- Yo, I'm worried about Hoppy.
- What you mean?

1623
01:21:19,943 --> 01:21:22,745
He's been wearing the same set of
clothes for the past two days.

1624
01:21:22,778 --> 01:21:25,949
He said something about his mom and
dad getting in a fight last night,

1625
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:28,251
and then his dad went out
after his mom left.

1626
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:29,785
- His mom left?
- Yeah.

1627
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:37,493
His mom having some struggles.

1628
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:39,395
You should find out
if he's got a place to stay.

1629
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:41,264
If he's out on the street,
then we can figure out

1630
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:43,199
where we can put him,
what we need to do, all right?

1631
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,833
All right.

1632
01:21:49,872 --> 01:21:52,141
"Kodug"? Is that a word?

1633
01:21:52,175 --> 01:21:54,010
I feel like I've heard
someone say, like, kodug.

1634
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:57,346
Or Kodug's like a country
or something like that.

1635
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:00,349
Can we just
get out of here?

1636
01:22:00,383 --> 01:22:03,119
Baby, the, um...

1637
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:05,421
the judge, um...

1638
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:09,358
said it's gonna be
another month.

1639
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:12,261
(sighs)

1640
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:14,430
I'm gonna fight again.

1641
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:19,969
- What?
- I mean, it's a charity thing, you know what I mean?

1642
01:22:20,003 --> 01:22:22,305
It's not like a real,
like a professional fight.

1643
01:22:22,338 --> 01:22:23,639
You know, it's an exhibition.

1644
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:27,010
(sniffles)
Um, but, um...

1645
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:29,245
I'm gonna fight again.

1646
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,280
- Can I go?
- Now, you know Mommy

1647
01:22:31,314 --> 01:22:33,016
didn't like you
watching the fights.

1648
01:22:33,049 --> 01:22:34,617
Well, somebody has to be there.

1649
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,086
Yeah, baby,
I'll, I'll, I'll be okay.

1650
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,656
- But I want to go.
- I don't think I can work that out.

1651
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:42,891
Then-then you can't do it.

1652
01:22:42,925 --> 01:22:45,028
Dad, you have to tell them
you can't do it.

1653
01:22:45,061 --> 01:22:46,629
Leila, I got, I got to do it.

1654
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:48,664
No, you can't.
I have to be there, Dad.

1655
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,299
Baby, I am trying
to get you out, just...

1656
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,600
- When?
- Leila...

1657
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,302
- When?!
- Leila, I'm trying.

1658
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:54,737
When?!

1659
01:23:00,276 --> 01:23:02,045
You...

1660
01:23:02,078 --> 01:23:03,246
I hate you.

1661
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:05,114
I hate you!

1662
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:07,250
Why can't you just get me
out of this place?!

1663
01:23:07,283 --> 01:23:08,617
- Leila...
- Why are you not...

1664
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:11,354
I can't. I can't right now.

1665
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:13,056
- Baby, please.
- I don't trust you!

1666
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:14,723
Just trust me.
Come on, baby!

1667
01:23:14,757 --> 01:23:16,825
You keep making promises,
and you don't mean them!

1668
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:18,627
- That's not true.
- Leila, just calm down.

1669
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,529
You should've been the one
that was killed.

1670
01:23:20,563 --> 01:23:23,099
- You, not Mom!
- It's okay, it's okay.

1671
01:23:23,132 --> 01:23:24,467
- You!
- Come with me.

1672
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,269
- Let's calm down.
- You! You!

1673
01:23:26,302 --> 01:23:28,271
- (door opens)
- I hate you!

1674
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:30,673
(door closes)

1675
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:47,956
(audience cheering)

1676
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:49,458
(grunting)

1677
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:54,330
Ooh, that defense
looking good, Billy!

1678
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,739
(grunting continues)

1679
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:06,008
TICK: Nice! That's the way
to block! Way to block!

1680
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,100
Keep that distance,
keep that distance.

1681
01:24:15,518 --> 01:24:16,952
Jab, jab, jab, jab...!

1682
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:18,254
Good!

1683
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:20,356
Keep moving.

1684
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:27,830
- He could last another round.
- You could be right.

1685
01:24:29,332 --> 01:24:32,401
- (bell clanging)
- TICK: Time! Time.

1686
01:24:32,435 --> 01:24:34,570
To your corners. Corners.

1687
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:40,776
Give me the towel,
give me the towel.

1688
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,645
His jabs aren't quitting.

1689
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:44,213
Keep your hands up, 'cause
you're dropping your hands.

1690
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:46,315
Just keep jabbing.
Keep jabbing.

1691
01:24:46,349 --> 01:24:47,950
This round, this round...

1692
01:24:47,983 --> 01:24:49,585
I need you to be
a little more aggressive, okay?

1693
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:51,254
Just for points, not for blood.

1694
01:24:51,287 --> 01:24:53,822
Keep your calm.
Tap, tap, tap.

1695
01:24:53,856 --> 01:24:55,324
(applause)

1696
01:24:55,358 --> 01:24:56,425
REFEREE:
Seconds out.

1697

Let's go, let's go.

1698
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:04,833
Go the distance.

1699
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:10,173
(bell clangs)

1700
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:11,540
Box!

(grunting)

1702
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:18,247
Keep your head moving.

1703
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:20,082
Move the body!
Way to move the body!

1704
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,195
There you go, there you go.

1705
01:25:24,387 --> 01:25:25,521
That's it!

1706
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:29,492
- TICK: Keep jabbing!

1707

There you go!

1708
01:25:34,096 --> 01:25:35,498
That's it!

01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,401
Jab, jab, jab, jab!

01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:42,363
- (crowd cheering, applauding)
- Keep moving!

1711
01:25:43,706 --> 01:25:44,973
Just jab, just jab!

1712
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:01,424
TICK:
That's it!

1713
01:26:01,457 --> 01:26:03,025
- Way to go! Way to go!
- Damn!

1714
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:07,896
Three! Four!

1715
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:10,065
Five! Six!

1716
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:11,900
Seven!

1717
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:14,270
- Eight! Nine!
- Way to go, baby!

1718
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:15,604
- Ten!
- (bell clangs)

1719
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:17,440
That's it!

1720
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:22,678
- (applause continues)
- MAN: Yeah, Billy!

1721
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:26,815
All right, will you just
tell her that I called

1722
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:29,585
and that, uh,
tell Leila I'm okay,

1723
01:26:29,618 --> 01:26:32,355
and Daddy won.

1724
01:26:32,388 --> 01:26:33,689
Yeah, oh, thanks, yeah.

1725
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:36,625
(chuckles)
Yeah, thank you.

1726
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:40,229
Beautiful.

1727
01:26:40,263 --> 01:26:42,064
Beautiful fight, man.

1728
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,269
Beautiful fight, man.

1729
01:26:46,302 --> 01:26:49,037
You looked great,
like a whole 'nother fighter.

1730
01:26:49,071 --> 01:26:50,773
Yeah, thanks.

1731
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:54,142
Can I talk to you?

1732
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:56,011
(sighs)

1733
01:26:57,413 --> 01:26:59,382
What do you want to talk about?

1734
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:00,883
I came to see you, man.

1735
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:03,419
(sighs) Well, you should
be looking at Brady.

1736
01:27:03,452 --> 01:27:07,456
You know me, I like to stick
with the sure thing.

1737
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:09,758
Congratulations
on that title fight.

1738
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:11,894
I heard Miguel didn't have
a hard time with Turay.

1739
01:27:11,927 --> 01:27:14,062
How'd you like to fight
for that title?

1740
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:16,565
Yeah, cut the bullshit,
all right?

1741
01:27:16,599 --> 01:27:20,035
Look, you needed some time off. Now
it's time to get you back on top.

1742
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,306
- What are you saying?
- I got some friends down at the FAC.

1743
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:26,342
They owe me some favors. I think
I can get you a early review,

1744
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:28,110
get your license back.

1745
01:27:28,143 --> 01:27:30,212
The changes you've made in
the past couple of months,

1746
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,548
I think the changes
speak for themselves.

1747
01:27:33,682 --> 01:27:35,418
What's the plan?

1748
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:37,653
Vegas, six weeks.

1749
01:27:37,686 --> 01:27:39,822
It's a big one.

1750
01:27:42,391 --> 01:27:43,592
Hey, Tick.

1751
01:27:43,626 --> 01:27:44,993
Jordan.

1752
01:27:45,027 --> 01:27:46,595
You did a great job
with your fighter.

1753
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:48,063
He works hard.

1754
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,433
Coach, I'm gonna
put this stuff in the van.

1755
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:51,767
- Yeah, thanks, Jon.
- Yeah.

1756
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,736
It's a great opportunity, Billy.

1757
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,838
I'll be in touch.

1758
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:02,645
What's that about?

1759
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:04,880
Title shot, Vegas, six weeks.

1760
01:28:04,913 --> 01:28:06,649
Really?

1761
01:28:06,682 --> 01:28:08,451
Six weeks?

1762
01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:09,785
You know what
that's about, right?

1763
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:12,054
- Yeah.
- He's gonna sell it

1764
01:28:12,087 --> 01:28:15,057
like it's a-a revenge match
around the murder of your wife.

1765
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:18,226
Yeah, it'll all be about Mo.

1766
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,628
You're not considering it?

1767
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:21,364
Yeah.

1768
01:28:21,397 --> 01:28:24,667
I got to make some money, man.

1769
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,202
I can't lose my girl.

1770
01:28:27,235 --> 01:28:29,505
This man right here...
You fell down to the ground,

1771
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:31,073
he just stepped right over you.

1772
01:28:31,106 --> 01:28:32,808
He fixes fights.

1773
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,343
He's a liar.

1774
01:28:34,377 --> 01:28:35,811
Yeah, look, I'm not
talking about him.

1775
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:37,045
I'm talking about you.

1776
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:39,482
I can't do this without you.

1777
01:28:39,515 --> 01:28:41,283
I can't do this with you.

1778
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,452
Why?

1779
01:28:43,486 --> 01:28:45,120
I don't train pro fighters.

1780
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,356
What, you're saying to me
that someone came in

1781
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:49,830
and offered the boys a pro shot,
you wouldn't give it to them?

1782
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:55,364
All I need is the six weeks.

1783
01:28:55,398 --> 01:28:57,600
I need six weeks.

1784
01:28:57,633 --> 01:28:59,535
I'll give you my everything.

1785
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:01,804
You get my everything.

1786
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,906
This is about my family.

1787
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:10,078
I can't lose my daughter.

1788
01:29:15,484 --> 01:29:16,819
Tick?

1789
01:29:18,253 --> 01:29:20,923
I got nothing
to say to you, man.

1790
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:28,931
(Billy sighs)

1791
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,776
(thunder rumbling,
siren wailing)

1792
01:29:42,578 --> 01:29:45,047
(grunting)

1793
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:51,920
Tick.

1794
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,057
Who's winning?

1795
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,034
You know Hoppy died?

1796
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:08,771
What?

1797
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:10,639
He tried to protect his mom,

1798
01:30:10,673 --> 01:30:12,675
and his dad shot him.

1799
01:30:12,708 --> 01:30:14,743
He's dead.

1800
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:23,719
(grunting)

1801
01:30:28,323 --> 01:30:30,292
(panting)

1802
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,031
(sobs)

1803
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:42,871
I should've known.

1804
01:30:42,905 --> 01:30:44,973
When you told me
that his mom left,

1805
01:30:45,007 --> 01:30:47,409
I should've known right then.

1806
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:54,717
You're supposed to be able
to protect them, you know?

1807
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,219
These kids coming up in here,

1808
01:30:57,252 --> 01:30:59,922
I'm telling them a bunch
of stuff that's bullshit.

1809
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:01,690
It's bullshit.

1810
01:31:01,724 --> 01:31:03,526
"It's gonna be all right."

1811
01:31:03,559 --> 01:31:05,393
"You can control your destiny."

1812
01:31:05,427 --> 01:31:08,931
"You could control this,
you could control that."

1813
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:11,333
You can't control shit.

1814
01:31:11,366 --> 01:31:13,001
What the fuck, man?

1815
01:31:14,603 --> 01:31:17,439
(sighs)

1816
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:20,308
The fuck?

1817
01:31:20,342 --> 01:31:23,011
What is this?

1818
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:25,981
What kind of,
what kind of shit is this?

1819
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,918
(sighs)

1820
01:31:29,952 --> 01:31:32,387
God must have some kind of plan

1821
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:35,023
to teach me

1822
01:31:35,057 --> 01:31:37,192
some kind of lesson.

1823
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:39,427
I just can't figure out
what it is.

1824
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:48,436
(chuckles)

1825
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:50,405
You know what Hoppy told me?

1826
01:31:50,438 --> 01:31:55,443
- Hmm?
- "You're a dream crusher."

1827
01:31:55,477 --> 01:31:57,145
Uh...

1828
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:58,947
it's like, it's like,
(stammering): when, uh,

1829
01:31:58,981 --> 01:32:02,084
one of them, one of them-them
games they play.

1830
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:04,653
I-I'm the Dream Crusher.

1831
01:32:04,687 --> 01:32:06,555
(both laughing)

1832
01:32:10,926 --> 01:32:13,796
That's like, you know,

1833
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:15,598
crazy stuff, right?

1834
01:32:15,631 --> 01:32:17,365
(chuckles)

1835
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:20,335
So maybe I'm supposed to learn
how not to be a dream crusher.

1836
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,771
(laughs)
You know what I'm saying?

1837
01:32:22,805 --> 01:32:26,208
Why stop now?

1838
01:32:26,241 --> 01:32:28,043
(sniffs)

1839
01:32:28,076 --> 01:32:31,680
You think that you can, uh...

1840
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:34,482
beat Magic?

1841
01:32:34,516 --> 01:32:36,551
No.

1842
01:32:36,585 --> 01:32:38,386
I can't beat him.

1843
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:40,188
Not without you.

1844
01:32:40,222 --> 01:32:42,658
Promise me something.

1845
01:32:42,691 --> 01:32:45,360
- Mm-hmm.
- Whatever happens,

1846
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,262
you'll still keep
taking care of yourself,

1847
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:49,865
and you'll take care
of your daughter.

1848
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:51,499
(sniffs)

1849
01:32:51,533 --> 01:32:53,335
JUDGE KAYLE (voice-over):
Mr. Hope,

1850
01:32:53,368 --> 01:32:55,503
after careful review
of your file,

1851
01:32:55,537 --> 01:32:57,973
including the assessment
from your case worker,

1852
01:32:58,006 --> 01:33:00,909
I'm gonna remove
the visitation restrictions,

1853
01:33:00,943 --> 01:33:03,378
and the reunification
can begin next week.

1854
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:06,649
You attorney will receive
notification in the mail.

1855
01:33:06,682 --> 01:33:08,550
Good job, Mr. Hope.

1856
01:33:10,118 --> 01:33:12,354
(Billy chuckles)

1857
01:33:12,387 --> 01:33:14,556
Thank you.

1858
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:25,734
- You have new shoes?
- No, I've had these.

1859
01:33:25,768 --> 01:33:27,369
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1860
01:33:27,402 --> 01:33:30,005
Baby, I don't remember
those shoes. Remember...

1861
01:33:30,038 --> 01:33:32,875
I don't have that much food here,
baby, but I can make you an egg.

1862
01:33:32,908 --> 01:33:34,242
You want an egg?

1863
01:33:39,147 --> 01:33:41,516
No, why aren't you eating?
What's wrong, baby?

1864
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:44,319
- Why didn't you eat anything?
- You think I'm a baby.

1865
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:47,790
- I don't think you're a baby.
- Then how come you won't let me come?

1866
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:50,659
Look, 'cause I told you,
I told you it wasn't up to me.

1867
01:33:50,693 --> 01:33:53,061
Well, it's up to you now.

1868
01:33:57,065 --> 01:34:00,468
Look, when Mom,
when Mom was... you...

1869
01:34:00,502 --> 01:34:03,538

all the decisions, you know?

For you, for me,
and...

1873
01:34:13,348 --> 01:34:16,952
(chuckles) me, I can't
make them, you know?

1874
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:19,221
Not so much.

01:34:19,254 --> 01:34:21,156
I know.

1876
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:23,658
What do you know?

1877
01:34:23,692 --> 01:34:27,129
Mom always said
we had to take care of you.

No, baby, that's not how
it's supposed to work.

1880
01:34:34,136 --> 01:34:36,104
All right? I'm supposed
to take care of you.

1881
01:34:36,138 --> 01:34:38,707
But the truth is,
I'm hanging on

1882
01:34:38,741 --> 01:34:40,475
by a thread here.

1883

You sure you don't want
to eat something?

Just, just...

1885

No, Dad.

1886
01:34:56,925 --> 01:34:59,627

Hey.

The guy that I'm fighting,

he's the guy from the hotel
when-when Mommy was killed.

Okay?

They're gonna say
a lot of crazy things.

Same time... it's like

Same time that leg's

See how it's coming
at the same time?

You switch, then the right foot
has to land with a hook.

Do what you gotta do,

You can't avoid saying it...

That this evening could produce
a great story

1936
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:49,851
of redemption for Billy Hope, who's been
through so much, but realistically,

what chance is there that Hope
could come back and win

against such a skilled

young champion as Escobar?

1940
01:39:56,891 --> 01:39:58,860
JONES JR.: The cards
are stacked against Hope.

1941
01:39:58,893 --> 01:40:00,962
Um, his age, um,
the fact that he's been off,

1942
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,765
and this guy is probably
the best fighter

Billy Hope, entering first,

with no entry music,

flanked by his new trainer,
Tick Wills.

1948

The ultimate revenge motive
for Hope tonight,

1949
01:40:26,154 --> 01:40:28,256
'cause his heart, he believes

1950
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:31,426
he's avenging the death of
his wife in a bizarre incident

1951
01:40:31,459 --> 01:40:33,395
in which Escobar was involved,

1952
01:40:33,428 --> 01:40:36,598
an incident for which no perpetrator
has ever paid the price.

LAMPLEY (over TV): What about the
choice of walking with no music, Roy?

1954
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:42,804
JONES JR.: Anytime you've got
a crowd of this magnitude

1955
01:40:42,837 --> 01:40:45,373
and so much energy
in one building,

1956

really, you don't need music.

six-week build-up to this fight,

1958
01:40:50,212 --> 01:40:52,680

"All business, all business.

all that other stuff.

LAMPLEY:
And here comes Miguel Escobar.

1965
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:10,865
Escobar is a product
of Colombia.

1966
01:41:15,002 --> 01:41:18,440
In the past, Roy Jones, when we
spoke about fighters from Colombia,

1967
01:41:18,473 --> 01:41:23,411
almost always, they were big punchers.
This is a different story.

1968
01:41:23,445 --> 01:41:25,447
JONES JR.: Yeah, this is
a whole different story.

1969
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:27,415
Not often do we talk about
Colombian fighters

1970
01:41:27,449 --> 01:41:29,151
and talk about
the full package.

1971
01:41:29,184 --> 01:41:31,052
Most of them come
with an astronomical amount

1972
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:33,955
of punching power,
but not skills to match that.

1973
01:41:33,988 --> 01:41:36,924
Tonight we have a guy
who is just as good

1974
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:39,594
offensively, skill-wise,
as he is powerful.

1975
01:41:39,627 --> 01:41:42,530
I said, more recently,
Sergio Martinez,

1976
01:41:42,564 --> 01:41:44,666
but Carlos Melzon was a beast,

1977
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:46,868
but this kid
is a boxer-puncher

1978
01:41:46,901 --> 01:41:50,205
with great speed, great power...
Something to see, Jim.

1979
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:51,673
He's no champ!

1980
01:41:51,706 --> 01:41:53,841
LAMPLEY:
And Escobar now promoted

1981
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:55,277
by Jordan Mains,

1982
01:41:55,310 --> 01:42:00,047
the man who architected
Billy Hope's career.

1983
01:42:00,081 --> 01:42:01,082
(bell clangs)

1984
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:05,453
You have a good fight.

1985
01:42:05,487 --> 01:42:08,122
I only gave him
six weeks to train.

1986
01:42:10,358 --> 01:42:11,759
- Jon Jon?
- Yeah?

1987
01:42:11,793 --> 01:42:13,695
Slip it off.

1988
01:42:13,728 --> 01:42:16,698
You don't have to watch it if
you don't want to. You okay?

1989
01:42:16,731 --> 01:42:18,900
LAMPLEY:
And if the defection

1990
01:42:18,933 --> 01:42:21,803
of Jordan Mains weren't enough,
Hope's longtime trainer,

1991
01:42:21,836 --> 01:42:26,107
Eli Frost, trains Escobar
against him tonight.

1992
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,843
REFEREE (over P.A.): Okay,
gentlemen, you both received

1993
01:42:28,876 --> 01:42:30,878

in the dressing room.

1994

01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:39,587

1999
01:42:41,689 --> 01:42:43,625
he wants a good, clean fight.

2000
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,860
Quite a number
of ring observers

2001
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:49,397
expect that's the last thing we
have any chance of seeing here,

2002
01:42:49,431 --> 01:42:52,600

in both corners
as round one begins.

2004
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:58,139

2005

that in the casting
of this fight,

2006
01:43:00,642 --> 01:43:03,545
Escobar is the superior boxer,

2007
01:43:03,578 --> 01:43:06,914
Billy Hope
the more physical brawler.

2008
01:43:06,948 --> 01:43:08,550
You have to make him miss!
Make him miss!

2009

GABE:
Come on, son!

2010
01:43:10,418 --> 01:43:12,987

Escobar getting off,

2011

2012
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:17,959
Go to body shots! Go to
the body! Go to the body!

2013
01:43:17,992 --> 01:43:20,495
ELI:
Come on! Apply that pressure!

2014
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:21,963
Put it on him now!

2015
01:43:21,996 --> 01:43:24,766
Escobar with the showboat.
Look at him.

2016
01:43:24,799 --> 01:43:27,302
Trying to take
Billy's confidence.

2017
01:43:27,335 --> 01:43:29,036
Come on, Billy,
now, come on.

2018
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:31,038
LAMPLEY: Escobar energetic,
bouncing on his feet.

2019
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,807
JONES JR.:
Escobar seems to be able to get

2020
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,942
anything that he wants...
He can hit him

2021
01:43:34,976 --> 01:43:38,280
with a straight right, he can
hit him with a left hook...

- above the left eye.
- He's holding, ref! He's holding!

2025
01:43:47,188 --> 01:43:49,824
WEEKS: Let him go. I got you.
Let him go.

2026
01:43:49,857 --> 01:43:52,427
- (crowd yelling)
- (bell clangs)

2027
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:56,197
LAMPLEY: Escobar is hitting him, and
Tony Weeks steps in, in the corner.

2028
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:59,000
- You didn't see that?
- WEEKS: Let me see, let me see.

2029
01:43:59,033 --> 01:44:02,504
LAMPLEY: It appears that Escobar has
drawn blood right here in round one.

2030
01:44:02,537 --> 01:44:04,872
LAMPLEY:
Well, Hope did his best

2031
01:44:04,906 --> 01:44:06,841
to make Escobar pay
in round one.

2032
01:44:06,874 --> 01:44:09,677
What he wasn't able to do
was make him miss.

2033
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:11,846
BILLY:
He's a fast motherfucker.

2034
01:44:11,879 --> 01:44:13,515
That's all right, that's all right.
You faster.

2035
01:44:13,548 --> 01:44:16,150
Don't worry about that.
Just do what we worked on.

2036
01:44:16,183 --> 01:44:19,153
You make him miss, make him pay.
All right?

2037
01:44:19,186 --> 01:44:23,925
LAMPLEY: By now, fans well
aware of the difficult passage

2038
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:27,128
Hope has been through...
The loss of everything, really,

2039
01:44:27,161 --> 01:44:29,163
that was valuable to him,
including the loss,

2040
01:44:29,196 --> 01:44:31,666
for a period of time,
of his hunger to fight.

2041
01:44:31,699 --> 01:44:33,301
- (bell clangs)
- JON JON: Come on, Billy!

2042
01:44:33,335 --> 01:44:36,137
LAMPLEY:
Round two begins, and it's Hope

2043
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:38,806
who's the aggressor
at the beginning.

2044
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,343
Now Escobar counters back.

2045
01:44:41,376 --> 01:44:44,178
- Your defense! Come on!
- JONES JR.: And Billy's doing

2046
01:44:44,211 --> 01:44:46,881
just the opposite of what
a boxer is supposed to do.

2047
01:44:46,914 --> 01:44:49,150
You're supposed to hit
and not get hit.

2048
01:44:49,183 --> 01:44:51,085
Billy is not hitting,

2049
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,154
and getting the hell
knocked out of him.

2050
01:44:53,187 --> 01:44:55,027
Come on, Billy, move
your head, move your head!

2051
01:44:55,056 --> 01:44:57,359
LAMPLEY: Early on,
it looks like Escobar's jab

2052
01:44:57,392 --> 01:44:59,594
- is too quick for Billy Hope.
- (crowd roars)

2053
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:02,964
Escobar working
downstairs and up,

2054
01:45:02,997 --> 01:45:05,667
following the body shots
with hard punches upstairs.

2055
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:07,201
(bell clangs)

2056
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:10,338
JONES JR.:
Good exchange right there

2057
01:45:10,372 --> 01:45:11,839
before Tony separated them.

2058
01:45:11,873 --> 01:45:14,542
Come on, baby,
you got this.

2059
01:45:14,576 --> 01:45:16,744
Watch that right.
Just keep the pace.

2060
01:45:16,778 --> 01:45:18,380
Use your speed.
Work your way inside.

2061
01:45:18,413 --> 01:45:20,181
MAN: Let's go, Billy!
Don't give up, boy!

2062
01:45:20,214 --> 01:45:21,583
(clanging)

2063
01:45:21,616 --> 01:45:23,017
LAMPLEY:
First couple rounds

2064
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:24,852
seem to have gone
Escobar's way.

2065
01:45:24,886 --> 01:45:27,321
Let's see if Hope
can raise his energy level

2066
01:45:27,355 --> 01:45:28,823
and make it more of a fight.

2067
01:45:28,856 --> 01:45:30,492
Move your head!
Move your head!

2068
01:45:30,525 --> 01:45:31,759
Keep, keep him up!

2069
01:45:31,793 --> 01:45:33,995
(crowd cheering)

2070
01:45:35,229 --> 01:45:36,731
(crowd roars)

2071
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:37,732
(bell clangs)

2072
01:45:37,765 --> 01:45:39,834
(grunting)

2073
01:45:44,472 --> 01:45:46,641
(crowd cheering, whistling)

2074
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:48,042
(bell clangs)

2075
01:45:48,075 --> 01:45:50,244
LAMPLEY:
High time for Hope

2076
01:45:50,277 --> 01:45:53,381
to begin working to the body
and try to turn things around.

2077
01:45:53,415 --> 01:45:55,316
Three left hooks
to the ribcage.

2078
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:57,519
Escobar catches him
with a right.

2079
01:45:57,552 --> 01:46:00,522
Down goes Hope.

2080
01:46:00,555 --> 01:46:02,123
First knockdown of the fight.

2081
01:46:02,156 --> 01:46:04,426
WEEKS:
...three, four,

2082
01:46:04,459 --> 01:46:06,528
- MAN: Get up, baby!
- Five...

2083
01:46:06,561 --> 01:46:08,496
six...

2084
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:10,097
TICK:
Get up! Get up!

2085
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:12,700
LAMPLEY: That left eye
is bleeding freely.

2086
01:46:12,734 --> 01:46:14,836
(bell clangs)

2087
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:17,304
You all right? You okay?
All right, sit down.

2088
01:46:17,338 --> 01:46:18,740
No, no, no. His eye.

2089
01:46:18,773 --> 01:46:20,207
He's hurt!

2090
01:46:20,241 --> 01:46:21,976
LAMPLEY:
And it looks already as though

2091
01:46:22,009 --> 01:46:24,779
things may be slipping away
from Billy Hope.

2092
01:46:24,812 --> 01:46:26,848
ELI: You got to keep
the pressure on, baby.

2093
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:28,950
TICK: Don't worry about
the eye, I got the eye.

2094
01:46:28,983 --> 01:46:30,985
LAMPLEY: That's a
gruesome-looking left eye...

2095
01:46:31,018 --> 01:46:32,654
ANGELA: If there was a problem,
they would stop the fight...

2096
01:46:32,687 --> 01:46:34,355
There's not a problem, okay?

2097
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:36,023
- JON JON: How's it look, Doc?
- I can see.

2098
01:46:36,057 --> 01:46:37,959
- He's all right.
- Yeah, he's good to go.

2099
01:46:37,992 --> 01:46:39,393
- TICK: Good! Good!
- Good to go.

2100
01:46:39,427 --> 01:46:41,362
LAMPLEY:
Well, Hope's fans would say

2101
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:43,731
it wouldn't be Billy
if he weren't bleeding.

2102
01:46:43,765 --> 01:46:45,967
Show him.
It's time to show him, baby.

2103
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,334
- Time to show him this time.
- (bell clangs)

♪

2105
01:46:50,304 --> 01:46:53,741
LAMPLEY:
Back in the center of the ring.

2106
01:46:53,775 --> 01:46:55,409
Hope unloading
right-hand leads.

2107
01:46:55,443 --> 01:46:57,445
- Come on, Billy, show up!
- Hope trying to tuck

2108
01:46:57,479 --> 01:47:00,347
that injured left eye
behind his front shoulder.

2109
01:47:00,381 --> 01:47:03,951
JONES JR.: And Tick must be like
his Freddie Roach to Miguel Cotto,

2110
01:47:03,985 --> 01:47:06,521
because Tick has done
a great job with his defense.

2111
01:47:06,554 --> 01:47:09,524
LAMPLEY: Almost as though, Roy,
Billy Hope didn't show up again

2112
01:47:09,557 --> 01:47:12,426
till the blood started to flow
from that left eye.

2113
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:14,428
JONES JR.:
Now Billy's showing up, Jim.

2114
01:47:14,462 --> 01:47:18,032
I have never seen
Billy Hope block a punch.

2115
01:47:18,065 --> 01:47:20,902
- This is unbelievable. Look at him.
- Nice!

2116
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:25,039
JONES JR.: What a good three-punch
combination out of the shoulder roll

2117
01:47:25,072 --> 01:47:26,974
right there, from Billy Hope.

2118
01:47:27,008 --> 01:47:29,777
- (crowd roars)
- MAN: Come on, Billy!

2119
01:47:29,811 --> 01:47:32,747
LAMPLEY: This is
Hope's best round so far.

2120
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:36,951
(crowd roars)

2121
01:47:36,984 --> 01:47:39,053
That's it! That's it!

2122
01:47:39,086 --> 01:47:41,255
LAMPLEY: And they're talking
to each other

2123
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:43,958
- (bell clangs)
- in the center of the ring.

2124
01:47:43,991 --> 01:47:45,793
TICK: Good.
Stay in the shell.

2125
01:47:45,827 --> 01:47:48,162
Protect yourself. He's
switching his style up on us.

2126
01:47:48,195 --> 01:47:50,031
- He's rolling his shoulder.
- I can't hit that motherfucker.

2127
01:47:50,064 --> 01:47:52,466
- How's it looking, Doc?
- We got this, we got this.

2128
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,769
- MIGUEL: I'm good, Doc.
- Okay, yeah, you're good to go.

2129
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:56,037
Get the fuck...

(cheering, whistling)

2131
01:47:58,005 --> 01:48:00,174
You know who you are? You're a champion.
You can do it!

2132
01:48:00,207 --> 01:48:01,543
This is yours, all right?

2133
01:48:01,576 --> 01:48:02,544
You're a champion.

2134
01:48:02,577 --> 01:48:04,078
Let's go!

2135
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:06,347
LAMPLEY: Halfway through
the 12-round fight

2136
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:10,351
in Las Vegas, now they're even: Hope
bleeding from above the left eye.

2137
01:48:10,384 --> 01:48:13,821
Escobar bleeding
from above the right.

2138
01:48:17,391 --> 01:48:18,526
(bell clangs)

2139
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:22,329
Hope mounting
more and more offense now.

2140
01:48:22,363 --> 01:48:26,300
And now he fires back
with a big right hand.

2141
01:48:27,535 --> 01:48:29,103
(bell clangs)

2142
01:48:29,136 --> 01:48:31,138
- We got this.
- And they're working hard

2143
01:48:31,172 --> 01:48:33,875
to keep that right eye together
for Escobar, in his corner.

2144
01:48:33,908 --> 01:48:36,110
They're working just as hard

2145
01:48:36,143 --> 01:48:38,345
to keep Billy Hope's left eye
in the fight.

2146

- (crowd cheering)
- (bell clangs)

LAMPLEY:
Hard right hand!

2148
01:48:42,784 --> 01:48:44,351
Get off the rope!

2149
01:48:44,385 --> 01:48:46,087
LAMPLEY:
Hope trapped in the corner.

2150
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,355
Some of those shots
were blocked,

2151
01:48:48,389 --> 01:48:50,658
but it was another big rally
for Miguel Escobar.

2152
01:48:50,692 --> 01:48:52,794
Both men have been hurt

2153
01:48:52,827 --> 01:48:54,562
- (bell clangs)
- in this round.

2154
01:48:54,596 --> 01:48:58,532
Early rounds seemed to belong
to Miguel Escobar.

2155
01:48:58,566 --> 01:49:01,335
Middle rounds definitely
belonged to Billy Hope.

2156
01:49:01,368 --> 01:49:04,706
And now, as we come
to the 11th and 12th,

2157
01:49:04,739 --> 01:49:09,877
it's a close fight on the table for
whichever fighter wants it most.

2158
01:49:09,911 --> 01:49:11,613
- MAN: Shake it off, Billy!
- BILLY: I'm fuckin' tired, man.

2159
01:49:11,646 --> 01:49:13,615
TICK:
He's more tired than you are.

2160
01:49:13,648 --> 01:49:15,617
Two more, Billy... you just keep
doing what you're doing.

2161
01:49:15,650 --> 01:49:18,152
That fucker hits hard
as a motherfucker.

2162
01:49:18,185 --> 01:49:19,787
I need you to counter,
I need you to pivot.

2163
01:49:19,821 --> 01:49:22,323
I need you to stay
in the shell. Hear me?

2164
01:49:22,356 --> 01:49:24,158
You got to stay focused,
stay in this fight.

2165
01:49:24,191 --> 01:49:25,960
- Punch and move.
- You were his fuckin' trainer!

2166
01:49:25,993 --> 01:49:27,929
Why don't you tell me how to
fuckin' beat the guy, man?

2167
01:49:27,962 --> 01:49:29,964
(cheering, whistling)

2168
01:49:29,997 --> 01:49:31,966
TICK: You're ready for this.
You ain't tired.

2169
01:49:31,999 --> 01:49:34,235
You strong, you strong.
This is your time.

2170
01:49:34,268 --> 01:49:36,103
This is your moment, Billy.

2174
01:49:48,816 --> 01:49:51,318
(crowd noise growing louder)

2175
01:49:51,352 --> 01:49:53,387
MAN (chanting):
Billy Hope! Billy Hope!

2176
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:54,789
(bell clangs)

2177
01:49:54,822 --> 01:49:56,357
LAMPLEY:
Now with two rounds to go,

2178
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:59,627
let's see which man
can impose his will

2179
01:49:59,661 --> 01:50:00,928
in the championship rounds.

2180
01:50:00,962 --> 01:50:02,596
MAN:
Come on, move, go!

2181
01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:05,599
LAMPLEY: Both men bleeding
badly from one eye.

2182
01:50:05,633 --> 01:50:07,434
MAN:
Don't stay still! Let's go!

2183
01:50:07,468 --> 01:50:09,971
LAMPLEY: It has elevated
to a state of war.

2184
01:50:11,773 --> 01:50:13,941
JONES JR.:
That's right, Jim.

2185
01:50:13,975 --> 01:50:16,177
(grunting)

2186
01:50:18,846 --> 01:50:22,449
JONES JR.: There are cuts everywhere,
there's blood everywhere.

2187
01:50:22,483 --> 01:50:24,986
LAMPLEY:
Nothing to hold back now.

2188
01:50:25,019 --> 01:50:29,623
Underneath it all,
a subtext of hatred,

2189
01:50:29,657 --> 01:50:32,093
anger, revenge...

2190
01:50:32,126 --> 01:50:34,862
which may or may not
be relieved

2191
01:50:34,896 --> 01:50:37,431
by the violent combat

2192
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:40,534
in which they
now immerse themselves.

2193
01:50:40,567 --> 01:50:42,469
That's it! That's what
I'm talking about! That's it!

2194
01:50:42,503 --> 01:50:44,605
LAMPLEY: At this point,
it's a war of attrition...

2195
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:46,908
- (crowd roars)
- a fight to the finish.

2196
01:50:46,941 --> 01:50:50,778
MIGUEL: Listen, now, your wife
can't save you now, bitch!

2197
01:50:50,812 --> 01:50:52,013
Yeah, she can't save you now.

2198
01:50:52,046 --> 01:50:55,249
(Billy yelling)

2199
01:50:55,282 --> 01:50:56,951
TICK: What you doing?
Stick to the plan!

2200
01:50:56,984 --> 01:50:58,686
What are you trying to do?
Stick to the plan!

2201
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,521
- (bell clangs)
- LAMPLEY: Tony Weeks...

2202
01:51:00,554 --> 01:51:03,157
is caught between two monsters,

2203
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:05,259
- as they fire away...
- LEILA: What is he doing?

2204
01:51:05,292 --> 01:51:08,295
- What's going on?
- What is he doing?

2205
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:10,197
What did he do to my dad?

2206
01:51:10,231 --> 01:51:12,033
- What happened to him?
- MAN: It's okay, sweetie.

2207
01:51:12,066 --> 01:51:14,268
What's wrong with him?

2208
01:51:14,301 --> 01:51:16,403
Keep throwing them bars.
Just keep throwing them bars.

2209
01:51:16,437 --> 01:51:18,072
Come on, keep it
playing with his head.

2210
01:51:18,105 --> 01:51:19,707
Keep it playing...
Come on, Coach.

2211
01:51:19,741 --> 01:51:21,375
(gasping)

2212
01:51:21,408 --> 01:51:23,310
All right,
you're about to blow this.

2213
01:51:23,344 --> 01:51:25,747
You got to be calm,
you got to be calm.

2214
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:27,181
Everybody else
is walking slow.

2215
01:51:27,214 --> 01:51:29,150
This world is yours,
this world is yours.

2216
01:51:29,183 --> 01:51:31,152
Your soul is here...
Give me a towel.

2217
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:33,020
God is watching you.

2218
01:51:33,054 --> 01:51:34,856
Your wife is watching you.

2219
01:51:34,889 --> 01:51:36,858
I'm watching you.

2220
01:51:36,891 --> 01:51:38,392
Your daughter's watching you.

2221
01:51:38,425 --> 01:51:40,361
Don't let this man
control you.

2222
01:51:40,394 --> 01:51:42,196
Don't let him
control you.

2223
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:44,531
JONES JR.:
This is exceptional to me.

2224
01:51:44,565 --> 01:51:46,133
LAMPLEY:
And part of a resurgent career,

2225
01:51:46,167 --> 01:51:47,835
as Hope is trying to come back

2226
01:51:47,869 --> 01:51:49,871
from life-damaging
circumstances,

2227
01:51:49,904 --> 01:51:51,438
including, of course,

2228
01:51:51,472 --> 01:51:54,175
the unexpected death
of his wife Maureen.

2229
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,542
Don't let him get
into your head.

2230
01:51:55,576 --> 01:51:57,411
Don't let him
take this from you.

2231
01:51:57,444 --> 01:51:59,847
You got one shot. Go southpaw.
Go southpaw on his ass.

2232
01:51:59,881 --> 01:52:01,749
You go in there
and you kick his ass!

2233
01:52:01,783 --> 01:52:03,517
You hear me? You show up,
you show him... you show him

2234
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:05,319
- WEEKS: Seconds out!
- You're Billy the Great!

2235
01:52:05,352 --> 01:52:07,254
I want to see Billy the Great!

2236
01:52:07,288 --> 01:52:10,057
You got to go out there
and you... beat his ass!

2237
01:52:10,091 --> 01:52:11,258
Clap now.

2238
01:52:13,094 --> 01:52:14,661
LAMPLEY:
Already tonight,

2239
01:52:14,695 --> 01:52:16,730
a lot of expectations
have been amended

2240
01:52:16,764 --> 01:52:19,000
by the style of the fight,
by the competitiveness

2241
01:52:19,033 --> 01:52:20,802
of the fight, and now...

2242
01:52:20,835 --> 01:52:23,370
- (bell clangs)
- by the unexpected circumstance

2243
01:52:23,404 --> 01:52:25,506
of us entering the 12th round

2244
01:52:25,539 --> 01:52:28,009
of a fight that
no ringside expert

2245
01:52:28,042 --> 01:52:32,146
ever dreamed could
possibly go the distance.

2246
01:52:32,179 --> 01:52:34,281
- Come on, Billy!
- JONES JR.: I'm not sure

2247
01:52:34,315 --> 01:52:36,583
who's winning
this fight right now.

2248
01:52:36,617 --> 01:52:41,722
LAMPLEY: Escobar tasted both of those
big punches, and now he's not throwing,

2249
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:43,791
as Hope lines him up
and tries to tee off.

2250
01:52:43,825 --> 01:52:46,727
JONES JR.: Escobar is in
trouble, he's in bad trouble.

2251
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:51,032
LAMPLEY: Now Escobar comes back
with his own combination!

2252
01:52:51,065 --> 01:52:53,400
- Protect yourself!
- LAMPLEY: They take turns

2253
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:57,304
trading combinations
and covering up

2254
01:52:57,338 --> 01:52:59,974
as the momentum shifts
back and forth

2255
01:53:00,007 --> 01:53:02,944
from one fighter to the other.

2256
01:53:02,977 --> 01:53:06,213
Tremendous uppercut by Hope!
And down goes Billy!

2257
01:53:06,247 --> 01:53:08,282
Ref, come on! Come on!

2258
01:53:08,315 --> 01:53:10,651
LAMPLEY: Tony Weeks
is gonna call it a low blow.

2259
01:53:10,684 --> 01:53:12,619
He's hurting him.
He's hurting him.

2260
01:53:12,653 --> 01:53:14,555
- It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
- He's hurting him.

2261
01:53:14,588 --> 01:53:16,490
(crowd jeering)

2262
01:53:16,523 --> 01:53:18,225
Come on, Billy...!
Come on!

2263
01:53:18,259 --> 01:53:19,961
WEEKS: One point, low blow.
Hear that?

2264
01:53:19,994 --> 01:53:22,496
- One point, low blow...
- LAMPLEY: There's no count,

2265
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:25,967
and Escobar is losing a point
for the low blow.

2266
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,668
- Let me know when you're ready.
- I'm good.

2267
01:53:27,701 --> 01:53:29,070
You ready?
Okay, here we go. Time in.

2268
01:53:29,103 --> 01:53:30,604
Let's go.

2269
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:32,506
LAMPLEY:
This could be critical

2270
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:37,378
for what should be very
close scores at this moment.

2271
01:53:37,411 --> 01:53:39,646
We're about a minute away
from putting this

2272
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:41,849
in the hands
of three judges at ringside.

2273
01:53:41,883 --> 01:53:43,750
MAN:
Let's go!

2274
01:53:43,784 --> 01:53:47,288
LAMPLEY: Hope needs one last big shot.
Both men all-out.

2275
01:53:47,321 --> 01:53:51,358
Escobar comes back
with a hard right hand.

2276
01:53:55,062 --> 01:53:56,330
Come on, man.

2277
01:53:56,363 --> 01:53:58,265
Now we near the last minute

2278
01:53:58,299 --> 01:54:01,768
of what has become
a spectacular seesaw fight.

2279
01:54:05,139 --> 01:54:06,607
Switch up! Switch up!

2280
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,775
Now's the time, Billy!
Now's the time!

2281
01:54:08,809 --> 01:54:11,378
(shouting fades)

2282
01:54:12,947 --> 01:54:14,615
♪

2283
01:54:19,686 --> 01:54:21,788
(echoing boom)

2284
01:54:31,098 --> 01:54:33,734
(echoing thud)

2285
01:54:33,767 --> 01:54:37,004
(crowd cheering)

2286
01:54:37,038 --> 01:54:39,840
LAMPLEY: Now Hope switches feet
for a southpaw uppercut,

2287
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:41,875
and down goes Escobar!

2288
01:54:41,909 --> 01:54:44,011
- (all shouting triumphantly)
- Yeah, Billy! Yeah! Yeah!

2289
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:46,613
- Yeah!
- Southpaw! Yes!

2290
01:54:46,647 --> 01:54:49,650
LAMPLEY: Tremendous left-hand
shot by Billy Hope.

2291
01:54:49,683 --> 01:54:52,353
JONES JR.: What an unbelievable
left uppercut

2292
01:54:52,386 --> 01:54:53,554
from the southpaw position.

2293
01:54:53,587 --> 01:54:55,489
WEEKS:
...five, six...

2294
01:54:55,522 --> 01:54:58,559
JONES JR.: Wow! Who would've
ever seen this coming?

2295
01:54:58,592 --> 01:55:00,294
- WEEKS: Come here. You good?
- BILLY: I'm good.

2296
01:55:00,327 --> 01:55:02,263
You good? Okay, fight's over.
Fight's over. It's over!

2297
01:55:02,296 --> 01:55:05,066
LAMPLEY: Escobar is saved
by the bell,

2298
01:55:05,099 --> 01:55:06,867
just as he was getting up.

2299
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,903
And Billy Hope finishes
the fight with a flourish.

2300
01:55:09,937 --> 01:55:13,407
We'll see what that does
to the scorecards

2301
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,943
in what could have been
a very close fight.

2302
01:55:15,977 --> 01:55:19,580
JONES JR.: That may have been the
two-point round to get him over the hump.

2303
01:55:19,613 --> 01:55:21,582
LAMPLEY: Whether he won
the fight or not,

2304
01:55:21,615 --> 01:55:23,350
he'll have
tremendous satisfaction

2305
01:55:23,384 --> 01:55:26,954
from having knocked
Miguel Escobar down.

2306
01:55:26,988 --> 01:55:29,923
Now let's go to ring announcer
Jimmy Lennon Jr.

2307
01:55:29,957 --> 01:55:33,027
- To find out who's the winner.
- (bell clanging)

2308
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:35,562
Ladies and gentlemen,

2309
01:55:35,596 --> 01:55:37,999
after 12 rounds of action,

2310
01:55:38,032 --> 01:55:40,201
we have a split decision.

2311
01:55:40,234 --> 01:55:42,436
(crowd booing)

2312
01:55:42,469 --> 01:55:44,905
Judge at ringside, Casey Borne,

2313
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:48,475
scores the bout 115 to 113

2314
01:55:48,509 --> 01:55:52,546
for Miguel Escobar.

2315
01:55:52,579 --> 01:55:55,782
- LEILA (whispers): No.
- Judge Raoul Fromes sees it...

2316
01:55:57,351 --> 01:56:00,687
...115 to 114

2317
01:56:00,721 --> 01:56:02,756
for Billy Hope.

2318
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:04,258
(crowd cheering)

2319
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:09,730
And Judge Ricky Quiles
scores the bout

2320
01:56:09,763 --> 01:56:13,267
116 to 112...

2321
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:16,870
in favor of the winner...

2322
01:56:16,903 --> 01:56:18,505
and the new...

2323
01:56:18,539 --> 01:56:21,642
WBC Light Heavyweight Champion

2324
01:56:21,675 --> 01:56:24,178
- of the World, Billy...
- He did it!

2325
01:56:24,211 --> 01:56:25,946
He did it! He did it!
