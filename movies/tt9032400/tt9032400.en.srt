3
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,235
It is time.

4
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,689
It's beautiful, isn't it?

5
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,359
I'm Ikaris.

6
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,694
I'm Sersi.

7
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,142
Thank you, Ajak.

8
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,998
Shit.

9
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,379
Excuse me. Excuse me.

10
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,941
I know I'm late, Charlie.

11
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,990
"In this broad Earth of ours,

12
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,493
"Amid the measureless grossness
and the slag,

13
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,872
"Enclosed and safe
within its central heart,

14
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,625
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

15
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,378
The poet's hope and optimism in humanity...

16
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:28,008
echoes our recent universal victory,
the return of half our population...

17
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,259
And, thank God, there she is.

18
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,972
Our brilliant museum scientist, Ms. Sersi,
the person who will be...

19
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,683
and was always supposed to be
giving you your presentation today.

20
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,687
Thank you, Mr. Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

21
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:45,734
Today, we'll be learning about the importance
of apex predators in a balanced ecosystem.

22
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,070
Poetry?

23
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,782
I completely ran out of things to say,
and these kids make me nervous.

24
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,159
Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

25
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:55,786
See you tonight.

26
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,913
Ooh! "See you tonight."

27
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,332
All right, settle down.

28
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:03,836
So...

29
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,713
who can tell me what an apex predator is?

30
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,882
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

31
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,217
Very good.

32
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:14,054
Apex predators do hunt their prey for food,
like all predators.

33
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,098
But one thing that sets them apart...

34
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:20,894
is that there are no other animals
in their habitat strong enough to hunt them.

35
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,480
Who can give me an example?

36
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:24,648
Lions.

37
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,567
-Wolves.
-Correct.

38
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,404
Earthquake.

39
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,825
Get down. Get down!

40
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,828
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

41
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,999
Let me help you.
Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

42
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,967
It's all right. Come here.

43
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,096
You're all right. You're all right.

44
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,682
I like this song.

45
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:41,975
Me, too.

46
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,353
Do you wanna dance?

47
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,480
Wait, what the hell?

48
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,649
Your hand!

49
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,237
You've had too much to drink.
I gotta go.

50
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:02,788
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

51
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:07,960
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dane</i>

52
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:12,089
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

53
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,216
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

54
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,641
Is this from the Middle Ages?

55
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,101
It has your family crest.

56
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,728
It must have cost a fortune.

57
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,522
I'm a good eBay bidder.

58
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,690
Thank you.

59
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,650
Happy birthday.

60
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:39,908
So, have you given any more thought
to us moving in together?

61
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,244
Yeah, I thought about it.

62
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,414
I can't move in with you.

63
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,416
Yeah. Thought you'd say that.

64
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,417
I'm sorry.

65
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,086
And I think I know why.

66
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,464
Are you a wizard?

67
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:55,966
What?

68
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,926
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

69
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,094
No. I'm...

70
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,555
I've noticed some unusual things
happen when I'm around you.

71
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,808
Like our water always turns to coffee
whenever the waiter ignores us.

72
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,976
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

73
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,395
And Sprite says things...

74
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,065
like you and your ex-boyfriend
broke up a century ago.

75
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:13,692
She said that?

76
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,068
And he can fly.

77
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,154
He's a pilot.

78
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,115
Get a room, you two.

79
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,743
Can we go now?
It's past my bedtime.

80
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,916
Are you really in love?

81
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,334
What if I am?

82
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,669
You better tell him the truth, then.

83
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,463
I'm working on it.

84
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,476
You guys wanna get pizza?

85
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:48,894
No, thank you!

86
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:54,233
He won't live forever, you know.
Move in with him.

87
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,109
I live with you.

88
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,530
Dane.

89
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,117
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

90
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,911
Dane, run!

91
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,549
-Sersi?
-Let's go.

92
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,636
-What is that thing?
-A Deviant!

93
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:23,971
You said you killed them all!

94
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,138
You told him that?

95
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,932
-You believed me?
-I do now!

96
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,190
What are you doing?

97
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,400
Keep Dane safe!

98
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,443
Sersi, wait! What?

99
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,036
You're fine, dude.

100
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,329
Sprite!

101
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,461
No. Stairs.

102
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,210
Run! Go! Go!

103
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,753
-Go!
-Come on!

104
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,803
It knows where we are!

105
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,055
How?

106
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,723
I don't know!

107
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,184
Sprite!

108
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,149
Sprite!

109
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,419
Ikaris!

110
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,506
Evening, ladies.

111
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,425
Watch out!

112
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,943
Wizard.

113
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,823
Sorry.

114
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,929
Did it just heal itself?

115
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,575
Ikaris.

116
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,245
It's good to see you.

117
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,539
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

118
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,464
I'm Dane.

119
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,049
Hello, Dane.

120
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,760
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

121
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:06,484
We're Eternals, from a planet called Olympia.

122
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,071
We came here 7,000 years ago on the <i>Domo...</i>

123
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:13,659
our starship,
to protect humans from the Deviants.

124
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:18,829
We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago, but now they're back.

125
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,377
Look, if you don't want to move in with me,
you could just say.

126
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,002
Dane, this is serious.

127
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,173
I know. I'm just still getting over
the fact you're not a wizard.

128
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,342
I was hoping you could change me
into a giraffe.

129
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,010
I always wanted to be a giraffe
when I was a kid.

130
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,471
It's too bad I can't change sentient beings.

131
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:35,973
You would have made a very cute giraffe.

132
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,188
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

133
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,567
Or any war? Or all the other terrible things
throughout history?

134
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,319
We were instructed
not to interfere in any human conflicts...

135
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,529
unless Deviants were involved.

136
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:51,905
Why?

137
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:57,244
If we'd protected humanity from everything
for 7,000 years...

138
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:01,290
you'd never have had the chance to
develop in the way you were meant to.

139
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:05,669
But if the Deviants were eradicated
a long time ago...

140
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,171
why are you still here?

141
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,422
We've been waiting...

142
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,924
to be told we can go home.

143
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,969
So...

144
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,013
Ikaris.

145
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,765
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

146
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,602
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

147
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,062
In the fifth century BC?

148
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,898
How long were you two together?

149
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,566
5,000 years.

150
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,944
I guess you can call that long-term.

151
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,447
What happened?

152
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,532
He left.

153
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:39,286
I always thought he'd come back, but...

154
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,538
he never did.

155
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,498
So, I moved on.

156
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,334
I'm glad you did.

157
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,377
I'm sorry.

158
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,297
I have to go.

159
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,975
<i>This morning,
an unprecedented global earthquake...</i>

160
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,727
<i>swept nation-states across the world...</i>

161
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,938
<i>causing damage and panic.</i>

162
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,690
<i>Many have speculated its connection
with the Blip.</i>

163
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,109
<i>The UN has called for an emergency meeting...</i>

164
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,403
That Deviant healed itself.

165
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,448
They could never do that before.

166
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,620
And it was coming after us instead of humans.
What's going on?

167
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:24,498
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

168
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,750
That Deviant is news to me.

169
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,588
Something's happening to Earth.

170
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,675
Can't be a coincidence.

171
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,928
We need to find the others.

172
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,514
I haven't seen some of them for centuries.

173
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,599
I doubt much has changed.

174
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,612
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

175
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,120
But we need to stick together.

176
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,582
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

177
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,877
Let's go to Ajak first.

178
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,754
She'll know what to do.

179
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,302
You hear that, Sprite?

180
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,971
Family reunion.

181
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,848
It's about time.

182
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,237
Hey, that one was mine!
Never mind.

183
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,584
Ajak.

184
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:15,752
Arishem.

185
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,798
We continue to keep Babylon safe
from the Deviants.

186
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,467
More people have come to seek refuge.

187
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:25,387
It is now the largest city on Earth.

188
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:28,390
The Eternals serving their missions
across the galaxies...

189
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,267
will learn from your success.

190
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:31,810
Thank you.

191
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:38,066
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

192
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:42,863
But I have noticed something special
about this planet.

193
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,285
And I fear that maybe this time
the cost may...

194
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:51,163
Do not become attached to this planet.

195
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,167
You must focus on the true purpose
of your mission.

196
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,086
I understand.

197
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:01,173
I will not let you down.

198
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:26,907
Phastos.

199
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,993
Did you go to the party last night
like I told you to?

200
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,161
The party, yeah.

201
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,829
-Yeah, it was...
-He worked all night.

202
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,248
Who was talking to you?

203
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,583
Get a life.
And where is Sersi?

204
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,751
Late as usual.

205
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,921
I'm sorry, but I have something
very exciting to show you, okay?

206
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,799
Wait till you see this.

207
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:48,595
What is it?

208
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,305
It's an engine.

209
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,517
It moves steam from high pressure
to low pressure.

210
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,728
It'll help them till their fields
at an incredibly fast rate.

211
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,272
It's gonna freak them out.

212
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,275
I mean, they only have
had the wheel 1,000 years, so...

213
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:06,363
You know, we could do that thing
where you use your mind to control them...

214
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,531
and then they could do it quicker.

215
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:08,949
Ajak, you listening to this?

216
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,952
Phastos, this steam...

217
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,121
-Engine. It's a steam engine.
-It's too soon.

218
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:15,706
And there she is.

219
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,583
What did I miss?

220
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:21,795
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

221
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,881
I am sure you have something simpler.

222
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:24,882
Simple.

223
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,633
Okay, let's see.

224
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,929
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

225
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,599
the plow.

226
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,560
'Cause that's what it does.

227
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,020
Plows dirt.

228
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:41,440
I met another group of settlers who are
building their homes in the northern fields.

229
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:42,983
They'll need to plant their own crops.

230
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,110
-Thanks, Sersi.
-Listen...

231
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:49,156
humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

232
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:54,870
But there is no telling what wonders
they will discover as they advance.

233
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,026
I just saw that.

234
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,070
There's so many other chairs, man.

235
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,404
You know, I could use my powers...

236
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,156
Come and have a drink with me.

237
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:32,616
No.

238
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,535
I can't let you go
and fight Deviants on your own.

239
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,870
-We need to guard the city.
-Get out of my way.

240
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:40,499
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

241
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,419
We need to trust Arishem's design
for this planet.

242
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,840
Thena.

243
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,678
It's an honor to fight alongside you.

244
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,556
And you.

245
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:02,145
My beautiful Makkari. You're late.

246
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:01,121
Well, she also says that
stealing is very, very bad.

247
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:09,338
Deal.

248
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:23,894
I promise I won't let my feelings for Sersi
distract me from my mission.

249
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:27,231
Humans are far from being able to
protect themselves from the Deviants.

250
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,316
We still have much to do.

251
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,986
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

252
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,072
I can feel it.

253
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,284
But you are allowed to live a life, you know?

254
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,329
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

255
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,731
Try.

256
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,360
Sorry. I'm making a mess.

257
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:17,990
Well, not bad.

258
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,275
It matches your eyes.

259
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,155
You're learning their language now?

260
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,449
If I want to spend more time with you...

261
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,576
I need to get to know them.

262
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:09,958
Wait, what did I say?

263
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,337
You said, "I am very beautiful."

264
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:17,549
You...

265
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:23,055
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

266
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,527
I'm yours, Sersi...

267
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:38,695
if you'll have me.

268
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,242
I love you, Ikaris.

269
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,663
I love you, Sersi.

270
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,398
Hello?

271
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,237
Ajak?

272
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,638
Ajak!

273
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,249
It was a Deviant.

274
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:47,092
<i>Our love</i>

275
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:50,596
<i>And our devotion</i>

276
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:56,268
<i>Were as deep as any ocean</i>

277
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,275
It was the last time I saw her.

278
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:09,323
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,
so I went to London.

279
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,953
Turned out, both of us were lonely
and we needed each other.

280
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,790
I guess, in her way...

281
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,960
Ajak never stopped trying to take care of us.

282
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:31,887
Bye, Ajak.

283
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,977
It's the first time in 7,000 years
one of us has died.

284
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,064
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London...

285
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:44,024
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

286
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,901
Deviants have never done that in the past.

287
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,111
It healed itself just like Ajak.

288
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:51,198
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

289
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,059
Arishem.

290
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:20,185
Sersi.

291
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:21,978
It is almost time.

292
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:26,065
Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?

293
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,110
What happened, Sersi?

294
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,739
The sphere
that Ajak used to talk with Arishem...

295
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,409
it came out of her body and went inside me.

296
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,286
Did you talk with Arishem?

297
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,539
Yes. He said...

298
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:42,875
it's almost time.

299
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:45,835
Can you try talking to him again?

300
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,213
I don't know how.

301
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,257
But she chose you to replace her.

302
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,176
And she gave you the sphere.

303
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,427
Hold on, Sprite.

304
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:56,554
Are you sure you talked with Arishem?

305
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:58,015
What else would it be?

306
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,517
Mahd Wy'ry.

307
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,055
Where are the others?

308
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,477
There were more Deviants than you said.

309
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,312
Well, I'm sure that was a lot of fun for you.

310
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:46,855
It was.

311
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,109
Once the others kill these last Deviants...

312
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,112
we will have eliminated them all
from the planet.

313
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,549
Don't.

314
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,344
We don't interfere in their wars.

315
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,013
This isn't war.

316
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,974
It's genocide.

317
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,393
Their weapons have become too deadly.

318
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,939
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
helping them advance, Phastos.

319
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:32,693
Technology is a part of
their evolutionary process, Druig.

320
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,403
It's not exactly something that I can stop.

321
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,572
No, you can't. But I can.

322
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:40,325
It's too late.

323
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:42,953
-Thena?
-Everyone is going to die.

324
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,080
Are you okay?

325
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:47,499
Thena?

326
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,588
-Thena? Thena, no!
-Thena!

327
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:24,119
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

328
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,080
Listen to my voice.

329
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,459
You are safe.

330
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:34,171
You are loved.

331
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,882
You're our Thena.

332
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:45,349
Hey, Thena!

333
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,768
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

334
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:07,663
-Is she okay?
-Yeah.

335
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,082
Sersi.

336
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:11,250
Thena, please.

337
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,335
Come back to us.

338
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,045
Okay.

339
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:33,730
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

340
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,819
There is no cure...

341
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,154
so no one really talks about it.

342
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:46,994
What happened?

343
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,245
Thena.

344
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:49,955
You attacked everyone.

345
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,749
Wounded Sersi, Phastos...

346
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,877
you nearly killed Makkari.

347
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:59,173
I don't remember.

348
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,425
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

349
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:05,762
Your mind is fracturing
under the weight of your memories.

350
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:10,184
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

351
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,563
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship...

352
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,566
where we have the technology to help you.

353
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:22,112
What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

354
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:23,780
She could have killed all of us.

355
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:24,948
Please.

356
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:29,119
Please, I want to remember.

357
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:32,039
I want to remember my life.

358
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,166
Thena, I love you.

359
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,959
But listen to me.

360
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:39,713
It's not important if you remember or not.

361
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:42,007
Your spirit will remain.

362
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:44,968
You will always be Thena deep inside.

363
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:46,428
Trust me.

364
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:47,846
Why should she trust you?

365
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,267
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

366
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:54,269
Druig, I know you're upset, but...

367
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:55,479
Upset?

368
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:00,692
We've trusted you for 7,000 years,
and look where you've gotten us.

369
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:07,199
I've watched humans destroy each other
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

370
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,745
Do you know what that does to someone
after centuries?

371
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:15,123
Could our mission have been a mistake?

372
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:19,127
Are we really helping these people
build a better world, huh?

373
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:30,556
We're just like the soldiers down there.

374
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,559
Pawns to their leaders.

375
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,311
Blinded by loyalty.

376
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,066
It ends now.

377
00:40:58,834 --> 00:40:59,835
Let them go.

378
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:01,336
You're gonna have to make me.

379
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,504
Stop.

380
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,596
If you wanna stop me...

381
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,765
you're gonna have to kill me.

382
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:39,333
I'll watch over Thena.

383
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,126
Let her keep her memories.

384
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,421
One day, when she attacks you...

385
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:47,090
you might have to kill her.

386
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:54,973
We'll take that chance.

387
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:05,943
You may all go.

388
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,113
The Deviants are gone.

389
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,951
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

390
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,702
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

391
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,704
We're a team, we should stay together.

392
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:20,791
I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris.

393
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:23,293
Do not forget your place.

394
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:28,757
This is where we say goodbye.

395
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,468
You are free to go.

396
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:35,013
I want you to go out there.

397
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,933
And live a life for yourselves.

398
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,852
Not as soldiers.

399
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:43,522
Not with the purpose
you were given.

400
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,692
Find your own purpose.

401
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:51,738
And one day, when we see each other again...

402
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:57,202
I want you to tell me what you found.

403
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,500
<i>Come my way</i>

404
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,171
{\an8}<i>Get the evil away</i>

405
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,757
<i>You came to save</i>

406
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,511
<i>And now you're here</i>

407
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:21,435
<i>Now you have come home
Give it all to me</i>

408
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:25,314
<i>You would risk it all
For my victory</i>

409
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,401
<i>Waiting for you
Scarcely can I</i>

410
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:09,441
I am Karun Patel.

411
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,318
Kingo's valet.

412
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:15,531
It's truly an honor to be in the presence
of the great Eternals.

413
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:20,786
<i>The ring of fire
Like the sun</i>

414
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:24,623
<i>You have risen
Mighty one</i>

415
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:36,802
Cut! Okay, everyone, that was good.

416
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:38,720
But we could do 10% better.

417
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,973
That was beautiful. Very, very good.

418
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:42,140
Really, so good.

419
00:44:43,225 --> 00:44:45,310
My friends from college are here.

420
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:46,854
Hello, boss!

421
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,148
Perfect timing! Welcome to the set of...

422
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:54,361
I'm playing you!

423
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:56,196
-You like the costume?
-We need to talk.

424
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:57,698
Tell the director
I have some notes for him...

425
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,032
We need to talk to you in private.

426
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:03,120
Oh, Karun, he's worked with me for 50 years.
I trust him completely.

427
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:05,706
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire...

428
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:07,165
and he tried to stake me through the heart.

429
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:09,418
I have apologized so many times.

430
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,171
Not quite enough times. Very close, though.
I'll let you know.

431
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:15,340
I have to get ready for the next scene.
Come to my tent, we'll talk there.

432
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:16,675
You guys are gonna love the next scene.

433
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:19,761
I come in on a wire
'cause, you know, I can't fly.

434
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:21,680
Wait, are we getting back together?

435
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:22,848
We need to talk.

436
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:23,974
I've been waiting for the day...

437
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:26,310
the world learns the true identity
of the Shadow Warrior.

438
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:27,936
Ajak's dead.

439
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,401
She was killed.

440
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:36,695
It was a Deviant.

441
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,868
The Deviants are back.

442
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:44,494
We don't know how many there are.

443
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,833
You need to come with us.

444
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:08,185
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

445
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,896
We just started shooting this movie.
It's the first of a trilogy.

446
00:46:11,522 --> 00:46:13,524
We just got BTS to do a cameo...

447
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,276
Sir...

448
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:18,654
-may I say something?
-Please don't say anything.

449
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,863
I think you should go.

450
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,240
I just said don't say anything.

451
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:25,661
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"

452
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:28,497
Remember? It's your favorite line...

453
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:33,168
from <i>The Shadow Warrior 2: Voyage of Time.</i>

454
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:35,754
Your family needs you.

455
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:48,851
Seven thousand years.

456
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:54,356
That's how long the battle between Eternals
and Deviants has raged for.

457
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:56,984
You think I'm a movie star.

458
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,987
<i>Well, I am. But I am also...</i>

459
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:02,489
<i>an Eternal.</i>

460
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:04,157
<i>Kingo, what are you doing?</i>

461
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:08,287
I think we should be remembered, so...

462
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:12,499
I am making a documentary about us.

463
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,669
You are about to meet
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

464
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:18,046
Sprite, tell them about yourself.

465
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:19,548
Oh, wait.

466
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:25,929
<i>Okay, well, we'll circle back to her.</i>

467
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:28,807
This is Sersi.

468
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:30,392
Sersi...

469
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,394
tell them about yourself.

470
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:35,647
<i>We're rolling.</i>

471
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:36,648
<i>Well...</i>

472
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:42,905
I can change a rock into water.

473
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:46,200
I could turn a rock into wood.

474
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:48,452
Or a rock into metal.

475
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:50,787
Actually, one time, I turned a rock into air.

476
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:51,830
Cut.

477
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:56,043
You know what? Why don't you think about it,
and we'll get back to you, okay?

478
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,461
Let's go.

479
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:02,508
Sprite says you're addicted to this thing.

480
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:05,802
Oh, this?

481
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:08,180
Look at this.

482
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:13,143
You know, seeing as we don't age.

483
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:15,479
I think you look quite good.

484
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:18,065
Don't you?

485
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:26,114
Nobody ever wonders how you managed to be
the leading man for over 100 years?

486
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:27,824
I don't know what you're talking about.

487
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:30,160
That is my great-great-grandfather...

488
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,663
that is my great-grandfather...

489
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:33,830
grandfather...

490
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,041
father, and me.

491
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:39,211
I'm part of the greatest dynasty
in the history of Bollywood.

492
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,671
Pretty impressive, right?

493
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,881
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

494
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:48,095
Okay, I got sick of moving every five years.

495
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:51,223
People freak out
when they notice that you don't...

496
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:54,309
age.

497
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:57,020
I thought we were friends.

498
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:05,904
Do you know why I love movies?

499
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,365
Because of you.

500
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:11,326
I missed sitting in the audience,
listening to your stories...

501
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:12,744
watching your illusions.

502
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,793
We should've all stayed together.

503
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,881
Ajak would still be alive.

504
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:27,259
She should have never let us go.

505
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,897
This is the Deviant you fought in London?

506
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:41,732
It's different.

507
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:44,568
There must be more out there than we thought.

508
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:48,155
Is this a Deviant, sir?

509
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,364
Yep.

510
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:51,992
It's a beautiful creature.

511
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,621
What? This? This?
No. It's hideous.

512
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:58,415
You've never had one
try to bite your head off. Roll.

513
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,295
You're about to meet two of the
greatest warriors the world has ever known.

514
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:07,174
<i>Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.</i>

515
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:09,051
And her trusty friend...

516
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:10,302
Door.

517
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:12,930
...a mighty powerhouse of strength...

518
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:16,058
<i>the fearsome Gilgamesh!</i>

519
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,603
Gilgamesh!

520
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:24,191
<i>What took you so long?</i>

521
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:29,112
You look younger today, Sprite.

522
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:30,781
I have the same apron.

523
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:32,574
Who the hell are you?

524
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,077
I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.

525
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:38,330
Oh, valet. Like Alfred in <i>Batman.</i>

526
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:41,166
Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.

527
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,919
No shit. I could have used some help.

528
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:46,547
We were attacked by a Deviant in London, too.

529
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:48,465
Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

530
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:50,342
You couldn't?

531
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:52,511
I was distracted.

532
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:53,971
Sure, man.

533
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:57,474
Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?

534
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:01,353
I'm sorry, Gil.

535
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,397
Ajak's dead.

536
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:07,526
It's true, buddy.

537
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:09,403
We lost her.

538
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:42,561
Sersi.

539
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:45,856
The attack triggered her.

540
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:47,941
She's no fun to be around right now.

541
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:51,028
Hey, Thena.

542
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,322
Look who's here.

543
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:55,365
Give me your hand.

544
00:51:58,118 --> 00:51:59,161
Thena.

545
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:02,331
Everyone in Centuri-6 is going to die.

546
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,082
Give me your hand.

547
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:06,460
It's too late. We can't save them.

548
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:07,503
Thena.

549
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:15,802
Thena.

550
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:19,223
We came to Earth together on our ship.

551
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:23,227
You're an Eternal.

552
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:26,813
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

553
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,066
The legendary protector of Athens.

554
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,486
The goddess of war.

555
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:36,823
Remember who you are.

556
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:46,333
Remember.

557
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:04,184
-Thena.
-Hi.

558
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:06,144
Hello.

559
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,480
Hey, who's your gardener?

560
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:12,192
This is just what you guys eat every day?

561
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:13,944
-Yeah, this is amazing.
-Every day.

562
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,196
-Thank you for this.
-Oh, you're welcome.

563
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:17,531
Help yourself.

564
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:20,868
This one is a trio of wine, beer, and mead.

565
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:23,495
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

566
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:25,747
That's so thoughtful.

567
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:34,131
Should she be drinking?

568
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:38,802
No, hers is non-alcoholic. For kids.

569
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:43,056
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

570
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:46,685
For kids.

571
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:50,230
I was just kidding.

572
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:53,775
Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you...

573
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:57,070
after we helped defeat Laufey's army
in Tonsberg.

574
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:58,322
What?

575
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:00,657
I'm a big baby.

576
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,701
Very mature. Can you stop?

577
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:04,912
-Stop.
-Speaking of Odin...

578
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:07,664
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

579
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:10,459
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

580
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:12,961
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone...

581
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:15,088
who do you think is gonna lead the Avengers?

582
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:17,257
I could lead them.

583
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:18,634
I figure I'd be good at that.

584
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,635
Yeah, you would.

585
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:22,012
Ajak didn't even choose you to lead us.

586
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:24,598
Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

587
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:25,766
-Harsh.
-I'm gonna let that one slide...

588
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:28,477
because, you know, you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

589
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:29,853
So what, you can fly.

590
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,730
I'm better-looking, everybody knows that.

591
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:32,898
Where you going?

592
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,568
I'm just gonna get some air.

593
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:43,825
This is really good, Gil.

594
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:47,204
You know, I could sell this.
Put my face on it, move some units.

595
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:48,664
I made it from corn.

596
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:52,668
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

597
00:55:06,723 --> 00:55:09,560
Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

598
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:11,687
Yeah, it's a planet.

599
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:16,233
She thinks she used to live there
until it was destroyed.

600
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,070
Always talks about
massive quakes ripping it apart.

601
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:22,155
Everyone died, including herself.

602
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:25,242
We had an unprecedented global earthquake
three days ago.

603
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,744
Oh, that's what that was.

604
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:29,663
I thought I was drunk.

605
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,583
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

606
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,878
I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

607
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:37,921
I've tried so many times.

608
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:41,216
Maybe you're trying too hard.

609
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:44,761
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

610
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:33,352
Sersi.

611
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:35,312
Arishem.

612
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:37,773
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

613
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,359
We think it absorbed her power.

614
00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:43,278
And something unusual is happening to Earth.

615
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:46,448
It is a side effect of the emergence.

616
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,493
The emergence?

617
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:54,414
It is time for you to learn
the true purpose of your mission.

618
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:59,920
You were sent to Earth to
bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

619
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:05,801
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

620
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:10,889
I plant Celestial seeds into host planets
across the universe.

621
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:16,895
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

622
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:23,902
<i>In order to grow...</i>

623
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:27,906
<i>Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy
from intelligent life.</i>

624
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:32,411
<i>The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans...</i>

625
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:35,247
<i>until the Eternals eliminated them.</i>

626
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:41,795
<i>Now, the human population of this planet
has reached the required amount.</i>

627
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:45,007
<i>It is time for the emergence to begin.</i>

628
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:06,069
But...

629
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,114
everyone on Earth will die.

630
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:13,869
The end of one life, Sersi...

631
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:18,040
<i>is the beginning of another.</i>

632
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:34,765
<i>Our universe
is a constant exchange of energy.</i>

633
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:39,811
<i>An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.</i>

634
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:42,981
<i>Celestials use energy...</i>

635
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:46,235
<i>gathered from host planets to create suns...</i>

636
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:50,155
<i>generating gravity, heat, and light...</i>

637
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:52,824
<i>for new galaxies to form.</i>

638
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:59,456
<i>Without us...</i>

639
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:02,793
<i>our universe will fall into darkness.</i>

640
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,422
All life will die.

641
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:10,384
Ajak knew the truth?

642
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:15,681
She has helped many Celestials
to emerge over millions of years.

643
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:17,558
So have you.

644
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,812
Earth was my first mission.

645
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:27,401
I was home, on Olympia.

646
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:31,196
There is no Olympia.

647
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:52,342
This is your true home, Sersi.

648
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:55,095
The World Forge.

649
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:02,186
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

650
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,182
Everything dies except us...

651
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:43,519
because we were never alive.

652
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,525
Why don't I remember any of this?

653
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:04,581
Because your memories are erased and reset
after each emergence.

654
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,251
They are stored here.

655
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:11,588
Why do you keep them?

656
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:15,676
I keep them in order to study the Deviants.

657
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:19,388
I created the Deviants, Sersi...

658
01:01:19,555 --> 01:01:22,474
for the same purpose I created you.

659
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:27,396
<i>Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.</i>

660
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:34,278
<i>I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them...</i>

661
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,989
<i>so intelligent life could grow.</i>

662
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:45,205
<i>But there was a flaw in their design.</i>

663
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:47,749
<i>They evolved.</i>

664
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,960
<i>Became predators themselves.</i>

665
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,131
And I lost control of them.

666
01:01:56,216 --> 01:01:59,219
I built and programmed you, Eternals...

667
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:03,223
to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution...

668
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,559
to correct my mistake.

669
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:11,982
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place...

670
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:14,401
as the Prime Eternal.

671
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:16,778
Do not fail me.

672
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:37,883
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

673
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:41,345
And our past memories are stored somewhere...

674
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:43,722
in space?

675
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:46,225
And Arishem made the Deviants.

676
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,811
I'm sorry, Thena.

677
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,396
You tried to warn us.

678
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:55,567
The last time Arishem reset your memories,
something must have gone wrong.

679
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:57,361
What do you mean?

680
01:02:57,528 --> 01:03:00,864
Well, that's what Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

681
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:04,535
All this time, Thena was remembering
all the other planets we were sent to...

682
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,787
and everyone dying during the emergence.

683
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:08,705
I thought we were heroes.

684
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:10,707
Turns out we're the bad guys.

685
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:13,168
We're not the bad guys, okay?

686
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:16,213
We've helped the Celestials
expand life across the universe.

687
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,550
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

688
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:22,636
Every time innocent lives
have been sacrificed for the greater good...

689
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:24,847
it turns out to be a mistake.

690
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,140
We have to stop the emergence.

691
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:30,936
Sersi, we have no right
to stop the birth of a Celestial.

692
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:33,981
There has to be a way Tiamut can emerge
without destroying the Earth.

693
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:38,277
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

694
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:41,321
Could Druig control its mind?

695
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:43,740
Maybe put it to sleep?

696
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:45,033
"Put it to sleep"?

697
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:46,618
Are you serious?

698
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:49,288
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

699
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,332
So I could take a vacation to Fiji, you know?

700
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:55,210
-We're talking about a Celestial, okay?
-We have to try.

701
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:58,714
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

702
01:03:58,881 --> 01:04:00,215
Right.

703
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:05,053
I'm human. I'm a little biased.

704
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:10,934
And do what?

705
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,187
Watch TV?

706
01:04:13,353 --> 01:04:16,857
When I could be
with the Earth's original superheroes...

707
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:19,443
as they try to save the world?

708
01:04:20,277 --> 01:04:21,486
Fine.

709
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:24,198
If you want to, stay.

710
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:26,116
Thank you very much, sir.

711
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,036
Gilgamesh...

712
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:30,746
could you please get rid of the saliva beer?

713
01:04:30,913 --> 01:04:32,206
I thought you liked it, man.

714
01:04:32,372 --> 01:04:34,374
We need to go. Now.

715
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:36,585
Find the others.

716
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:38,170
Once we're all together...

717
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:41,048
we'll decide what to do about the emergence.

718
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:16,583
It's very nice here, sir.

719
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,043
Don't be fooled.

720
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:21,255
Ignorance is bliss.

721
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:38,438
Hello, Sprite.

722
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,156
I missed all of you.

723
01:05:51,118 --> 01:05:55,038
Please, make yourselves at home.

724
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:02,880
You've given me a lot of bad news
in one go, my lady.

725
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:04,798
Will you help us?

726
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:06,300
I am glad that...

727
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:14,558
Hey, what's your service?

728
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,518
I'm not getting any bars.

729
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:21,565
Do you all remember this forest?
Beautiful.

730
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:24,776
It was the last place we all lived together.

731
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:29,198
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now...

732
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:32,367
from the outside world and from themselves.

733
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:37,247
Your kind, my friend, you will be responsible
for your own extinction one day.

734
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:39,333
Don't you think?

735
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,961
I think we must learn from our mistakes
and do better, sir.

736
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:45,005
You must not give up hope.

737
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:49,343
Oh, no, you didn't.

738
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:52,012
Okay, new rule,
no more possessing people's valets.

739
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:53,639
Where is your sense of humor, Kingo?

740
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:54,806
I'm sorry, sir.

741
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:57,184
Don't apologize, it's not your fault.

742
01:06:57,935 --> 01:07:00,562
You are not a god.
You know that, right?

743
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:04,358
How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.

744
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:06,109
I've directed some things, too.

745
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:07,653
Oh, yeah? Like what?

746
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:09,863
Some Internet content.

747
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:11,615
How many views?

748
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,700
I don't do it for the views.

749
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:15,661
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

750
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:18,121
-We need him.
-Ikaris.

751
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:20,249
I missed you.

752
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:23,252
Are you gonna charm me or threaten me?

753
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:25,462
I mean, there's a third option,
if you prefer that.

754
01:07:25,629 --> 01:07:28,507
It must be heartbreaking to find out
that you're not Mother's favorite.

755
01:07:28,674 --> 01:07:30,342
And I'm sure she'd be real proud
of what you've been up to.

756
01:07:30,509 --> 01:07:31,510
Druig, this is serious.

757
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:33,470
I'll tell you what's serious.

758
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:38,350
I've just been told I've been sent on
a suicide mission for the past 7,000 years...

759
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:41,895
and that my entire existence is a lie.

760
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:48,402
So, excuse me for not giving a shit
about your plan right now.

761
01:07:53,282 --> 01:07:54,700
Druig sucks.

762
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:56,493
He does, sir.

763
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:18,724
I don't like this place.

764
01:08:19,183 --> 01:08:22,394
Druig needs to think,
and Sersi wants us to wait, so...

765
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,770
we wait.

766
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:29,484
I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.

767
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:32,779
Those were the good old days.

768
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:37,201
What if I can't fight anymore?

769
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:39,912
Of course you can.

770
01:08:40,953 --> 01:08:42,997
What if I hurt you again?

771
01:08:43,372 --> 01:08:48,587
Come on. You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.

772
01:08:53,425 --> 01:08:54,843
Thank you.

773
01:08:56,303 --> 01:08:57,554
For what?

774
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:01,642
For always taking care of me.

775
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:05,729
I'd do it again.

776
01:09:08,564 --> 01:09:10,526
On any planet.

777
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,129
I like watching him, too.

778
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:32,464
Jeez.

779
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,216
I don't think it's creepy at all.

780
01:09:37,845 --> 01:09:39,680
Have you read <i>Peter Pan?</i>

781
01:09:39,846 --> 01:09:42,975
Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter...

782
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:47,479
Sersi is Wendy, you are Tinker Bell,
for obvious reasons...

783
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:51,108
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

784
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:53,068
What's your point?

785
01:09:53,527 --> 01:09:56,071
Tinker Bell's always been in love with Peter.

786
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:02,703
And it's hard for her
'cause she can never be with him.

787
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:07,124
I'm sorry, Sprite.

788
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:10,294
Kingo...

789
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,382
why did Arishem make me this way?

790
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:18,927
I don't know.

791
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:27,895
I thought you broke it.

792
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:29,855
Always bring backups.

793
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:36,778
You have a very angry family, sir.

794
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:39,406
Yeah, it's a big issue.

795
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:42,492
<i>What about King Midas?
Everything he touched turned to gold.</i>

796
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:43,660
<i>-Was that you?
</i>-Dane.

797
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:45,746
<i>-Confucius? Aristotle?
</i>-Call your uncle.

798
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:47,497
<i>What? My uncle? No.</i>

799
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:49,833
You've always wanted
to make amends with him, right?

800
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,377
Now is the time. Trust me.

801
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,129
<i>Sersi, you're so weird.</i>

802
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:55,547
Dane? Dane?

803
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,426
You're breaking up.

804
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:00,636
You're breaking up?

805
01:11:03,347 --> 01:11:04,973
How did he take the news?

806
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,976
Couldn't bring myself to tell him
it was the end of the world.

807
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,395
There's nothing he could do.

808
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:11,563
Sersi.

809
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:16,652
I'm worried about you.

810
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:20,614
If Arishem finds out
you're trying to stop the emergence...

811
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:25,494
I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

812
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,543
I'm not afraid.

813
01:11:33,794 --> 01:11:36,213
This violent cycle has to end.

814
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:42,553
Hey, stop worrying about me.

815
01:11:43,637 --> 01:11:44,972
Old habit.

816
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:54,273
Why did you leave?

817
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:57,192
I told myself...

818
01:11:58,068 --> 01:12:00,070
something must have happened to you.

819
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:02,239
So, I waited.

820
01:12:02,406 --> 01:12:04,867
Days became years...

821
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:07,244
and you never came back.

822
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,706
Sersi...

823
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:13,292
I've missed you.

824
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:17,963
I didn't want to leave.

825
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:22,259
There's something I have to tell...

826
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:24,094
Ikaris!

827
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,929
Ikaris!

828
01:12:35,105 --> 01:12:36,607
Watch out!

829
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:38,358
Clear the camp!

830
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:42,738
Get behind me!

831
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:43,906
One of them took Ikaris.

832
01:12:44,072 --> 01:12:45,240
It's an ambush!

833
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:56,210
Very nice, sir!

834
01:12:56,543 --> 01:12:58,086
<i>Are you mental? Hide!</i>

835
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,631
We need action sequences.

836
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:02,466
Sir!

837
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,843
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

838
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:09,973
How many cameras did you bring, young man?

839
01:13:17,814 --> 01:13:19,233
Kingo!

840
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:20,817
Come on!

841
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:28,742
This way!

842
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:30,077
Quickly! Come on!

843
01:13:35,207 --> 01:13:36,959
Get in! Get in!

844
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:15,747
Ikaris!

845
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:35,142
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

846
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:39,479
No.

847
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:42,858
Terrible timing, Thena.

848
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:44,693
Thena!

849
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:54,453
Stop, Thena!

850
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:31,031
Let them go.

851
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:32,741
Now is not the time, Sersi.

852
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:36,078
Please. I know you're better than this.

853
01:15:45,337 --> 01:15:46,463
Druig.

854
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:49,675
Go! Get to the river!

855
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,652
Gilgamesh.

856
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:11,029
A little help here?

857
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:12,322
Stay here.

858
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:13,991
Say it.

859
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:16,410
Stay here.

860
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,662
Good. You're okay.

861
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:31,884
They're headed for the camp.

862
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:33,760
Go. They need you.

863
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:35,345
Go, Ikaris.

864
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:45,480
Sprite, buy me some time!

865
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:56,575
Can you hurry up?

866
01:16:58,702 --> 01:16:59,620
Now!

867
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:05,459
Dishoom.

868
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,012
Karun! Did you get that?

869
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:18,931
I did, sir!

870
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:55,759
-Kingo!
-Just go.

871
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:57,386
I'm not leaving you.

872
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:58,762
Sprite!

873
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:34,464
Ikaris!

874
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:19,551
Sersi! Are you all right?

875
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:31,813
How did you do that?

876
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:34,399
I don't know.

877
01:19:47,538 --> 01:19:49,289
Stop, stop, stop.

878
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:52,167
Thena.

879
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:37,337
No. Gilgamesh.

880
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:39,131
Stay back.

881
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:48,807
Ajak...

882
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:51,852
Her memories...

883
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:55,939
I understand now.

884
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:59,359
I can see what she saw.

885
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:02,654
So many planets.

886
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:09,036
So much life destroyed
every time a Celestial is born.

887
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:11,622
Arishem used us...

888
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:16,251
and left us to die with each emergence.

889
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:18,045
We just wanted to survive.

890
01:21:20,506 --> 01:21:22,633
And then he sent you.

891
01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:28,096
I will kill you all
for what you have done to my kind.

892
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:31,058
You are not saviors, Eternals.

893
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,268
You are murderers.

894
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:37,856
Ikaris!

895
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:54,289
Thena.

896
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,544
Hey.

897
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:02,047
Remember.

898
01:22:10,347 --> 01:22:11,807
No.

899
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:14,977
No.

900
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,898
I'll remember.

901
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:21,608
I'll remember.

902
01:22:44,548 --> 01:22:46,717
I'll remember.

903
01:23:29,134 --> 01:23:30,719
When I left...

904
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:36,058
I thought about taking over the minds
of every human on this planet.

905
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:40,270
Violence, fear, greed...

906
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:41,980
all gone.

907
01:23:42,147 --> 01:23:43,315
Why didn't you?

908
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:46,068
Because without their flaws...

909
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,529
they wouldn't be human.

910
01:23:51,532 --> 01:23:54,535
Please, Druig. You can't stay here anymore.

911
01:23:55,285 --> 01:23:58,747
These Deviants are trying to keep us
from killing their own kind.

912
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:01,750
They have a conscience now.
That makes them more dangerous.

913
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:03,836
No, Sersi.

914
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,339
That makes them us.

915
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:10,008
Eternals and Deviants.

916
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:12,845
Arishem's children.

917
01:24:14,012 --> 01:24:17,766
But you are asking me to take control
of a mind of a Celestial.

918
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:21,186
I do not have that kind of power.

919
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:23,063
We'll need Phastos.

920
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:27,025
Well, good luck.

921
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:30,779
He gave up on humans a long time ago.

922
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:04,730
I did this.

923
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:08,984
If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

924
01:25:14,406 --> 01:25:16,283
Druig was right.

925
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,244
Our mission was a mistake.

926
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:21,455
These people...

927
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:24,499
they're not worth saving.

928
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:26,502
Oh, Phastos.

929
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:28,128
They're not worth saving.

930
01:25:40,307 --> 01:25:42,059
-Thanks.
-Give me a good one.

931
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:43,602
-All right.
-Over here.

932
01:25:43,769 --> 01:25:44,686
And...

933
01:25:45,354 --> 01:25:46,396
-Oh, that's great, man!
-Yeah!

934
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:47,689
-Yeah!
-Oh, yeah!

935
01:25:47,856 --> 01:25:49,525
-Nice.
-Good one. All right, ready? Throw!

936
01:25:50,817 --> 01:25:51,652
So close.

937
01:25:51,818 --> 01:25:52,903
-Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
-Yeah, okay.

938
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,030
-Watch this.
-Let me see. Let me see it.

939
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:57,741
Dad. I'm only a starter.

940
01:25:57,908 --> 01:25:58,909
Hi.

941
01:25:59,076 --> 01:26:00,369
Hello. Can we help you?

942
01:26:00,536 --> 01:26:01,453
Throw it again.

943
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:04,206
Hey, Jack. Ben.

944
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:08,794
Hey, guys.
These are my friends from college.

945
01:26:11,129 --> 01:26:16,176
This is Sylvia and Isaac.
That's Isaac.

946
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:18,679
-Isaac.
-Dad, that's Superman.

947
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:21,265
-Dad, that's Superman!
-Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

948
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:23,392
-No, no! He is Superman.
-That is definitely not Superman.

949
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:27,479
I saw him on TV.
He was in London, fighting a monster.

950
01:26:28,105 --> 01:26:31,525
And you were with a cape and you were
shooting laser beams out of your eyes.

951
01:26:32,234 --> 01:26:33,235
I don't wear a cape.

952
01:26:33,402 --> 01:26:35,654
-Oh, sorry.
-Okay, well, we should just go inside, right?

953
01:26:35,821 --> 01:26:38,323
Can I call you Clark? Is that what you
go by now? Because, you know...

954
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:40,117
You've called me worse.

955
01:26:40,284 --> 01:26:41,827
You got it, Jack?

956
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:43,078
Way to go.

957
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:45,289
-Yes.
-All right. Show me how it's done.

958
01:26:45,664 --> 01:26:48,250
Round and round and round
and round and round.

959
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:53,463
-Yep, you got it. Keep going.
-Come on.

960
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:05,184
Yeah. Incredibly natural, guys.

961
01:27:07,936 --> 01:27:10,022
So, after all these years...

962
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:12,274
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

963
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:13,942
No need to rub it in.

964
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:19,990
It all makes sense why she wouldn't let us
interfere with human conflicts.

965
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:22,201
Conflicts lead to war...

966
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:26,955
and war actually leads to advancement
in lifesaving technology and medicine.

967
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:29,124
So our mission was never to...

968
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:32,044
make a peaceful or harmonious world...

969
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:35,964
but to increase the population at all costs.

970
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:39,176
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

971
01:27:39,343 --> 01:27:40,344
That's bleak.

972
01:27:40,511 --> 01:27:42,012
Well, so is telling
your husband and your child...

973
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:43,764
that they could be dead within a few days.

974
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:46,016
Thought you'd given up on humans.

975
01:27:46,767 --> 01:27:48,727
I got lucky. Okay?

976
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:53,023
I have a family now.

977
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:55,526
They've given me faith again.

978
01:27:56,610 --> 01:28:00,697
And I see the good in humanity in them
every single day.

979
01:28:00,864 --> 01:28:02,491
So, look, I cannot help you.

980
01:28:02,658 --> 01:28:03,784
-I am never leaving them.
-Phastos...

981
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:05,035
I'm sorry, Sersi.

982
01:28:05,202 --> 01:28:06,578
It was wrong for me to use my powers...

983
01:28:06,745 --> 01:28:08,664
without thinking about the consequences
in the first place.

984
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:13,585
So, now, I choose to use my hands
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?

985
01:28:14,127 --> 01:28:15,337
Do you?

986
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:17,589
I don't use my powers anymore.

987
01:28:17,756 --> 01:28:19,091
You sure?

988
01:28:19,258 --> 01:28:20,092
What are you...

989
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:27,015
What the hell is wrong with you?
My child is right down the hallway!

990
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:29,184
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

991
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:31,562
-Oh, my God.
-I bet you've built the perfect safe house.

992
01:28:31,728 --> 01:28:33,272
What is this even made of? Vibranium?

993
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:34,356
Don't!

994
01:28:38,569 --> 01:28:40,070
Fall collection.

995
01:28:40,237 --> 01:28:41,488
IKEA.

996
01:28:41,655 --> 01:28:42,656
Ass.

997
01:28:42,823 --> 01:28:45,534
How did you even deal with this guy
for over 5,000 years?

998
01:28:45,701 --> 01:28:48,287
If you stay here, you might as well
invite the Deviants to dinner.

999
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:49,997
Never mind waiting for the end of the world.

1000
01:28:50,163 --> 01:28:51,415
He has a point.

1001
01:28:51,582 --> 01:28:54,585
No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up
in my life and expect me to go with you.

1002
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:56,753
-I'm not gonna...
-You should go, <i>habibi.</i>

1003
01:28:57,546 --> 01:28:58,839
You want me to go?

1004
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:01,800
You know what my mom would say to you
right now, right?

1005
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,472
He's a chronic procrastinator.

1006
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:09,600
I'm not leaving you two. No way.

1007
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:11,560
I'm not happy about it...

1008
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:15,480
but if there's a chance for us to watch Jack
grow up to live a life of his own...

1009
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:17,357
we should take it.

1010
01:30:45,696 --> 01:30:47,531
The <i>Domo.</i>

1011
01:30:48,699 --> 01:30:50,200
Wow.

1012
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:03,130
<i>A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.</i>

1013
01:31:03,964 --> 01:31:06,842
<i>An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.</i>

1014
01:31:07,009 --> 01:31:09,595
<i>What are you doing? You know you're
creeping us out. You know that, right?</i>

1015
01:31:10,262 --> 01:31:12,681
<i>Oh, God! Stay calm, T, please!</i>

1016
01:31:16,476 --> 01:31:18,854
<i>Chips. It's just chips.</i>

1017
01:31:19,271 --> 01:31:23,442
<i>As you can see, being an Eternal does not
preclude you from having human emotions...</i>

1018
01:31:23,609 --> 01:31:25,402
<i>such as cowardice.</i>

1019
01:31:27,905 --> 01:31:29,489
What has she done?

1020
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:33,327
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

1021
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:37,873
This is Makkari.
Or should I say Miss Havisham?

1022
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,750
None of us have seen her for centuries.

1023
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:04,733
Is that the Ebony Blade?

1024
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,151
Excalibur.

1025
01:32:07,694 --> 01:32:09,279
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

1026
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:23,544
That, and the world is ending.

1027
01:32:28,048 --> 01:32:29,299
Have you seen my movies?

1028
01:32:33,095 --> 01:32:34,096
DVD?

1029
01:32:34,471 --> 01:32:36,014
It's all about streaming now.

1030
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:38,100
You know, what you need is a Kindle.

1031
01:32:38,267 --> 01:32:40,310
Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

1032
01:32:40,936 --> 01:32:43,730
You know, I just realized
that if you don't know what an iPad is...

1033
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:46,024
there's almost no way to explain it.

1034
01:32:50,237 --> 01:32:54,575
So, how did you end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet...

1035
01:32:54,741 --> 01:32:57,661
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

1036
01:33:00,747 --> 01:33:02,124
Did you miss me?

1037
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:04,877
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this...

1038
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:07,129
-Is this new? Because I hate it.
-Are you two...

1039
01:33:07,296 --> 01:33:10,257
Phastos, I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1040
01:33:10,424 --> 01:33:11,884
Okay, get ready for it.

1041
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:16,305
Bracelets?

1042
01:33:16,805 --> 01:33:17,890
You made us bracelets?

1043
01:33:18,056 --> 01:33:19,975
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1044
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:23,812
Celestials are the most powerful
energy generators in the universe.

1045
01:33:23,979 --> 01:33:27,232
When Arishem made us,
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy...

1046
01:33:27,441 --> 01:33:30,569
to keep our bodies regenerating.
The bracelets, in theory...

1047
01:33:30,736 --> 01:33:32,696
shut down our regeneration process.

1048
01:33:32,863 --> 01:33:35,949
And once that happens,
our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy.

1049
01:33:36,283 --> 01:33:37,284
What for?

1050
01:33:37,451 --> 01:33:40,245
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy...

1051
01:33:40,787 --> 01:33:44,082
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1052
01:33:44,249 --> 01:33:46,752
If I can find a way to connect us all...

1053
01:33:46,919 --> 01:33:48,879
one of us could become immensely powerful...

1054
01:33:49,046 --> 01:33:51,757
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest...

1055
01:33:51,924 --> 01:33:53,091
forming...

1056
01:33:56,678 --> 01:33:58,055
a Uni-Mind.

1057
01:34:01,808 --> 01:34:03,769
"Uni" meaning "one," "mind" meaning "mind."

1058
01:34:03,936 --> 01:34:04,937
Oh, no, we heard you the first time.

1059
01:34:05,103 --> 01:34:06,396
-Terrible name.
-We'll brainstorm...

1060
01:34:07,064 --> 01:34:08,065
"Brainstorm"!

1061
01:34:08,232 --> 01:34:09,733
-That's a way better name!
-No, I invented it...

1062
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:10,901
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

1063
01:34:16,865 --> 01:34:19,284
We find humans a new home on another planet.

1064
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:22,287
Are we building a big ship, too?
Take a pair of each animal?

1065
01:34:22,454 --> 01:34:24,831
Well, you know what's never saved the planet?
Your sarcasm.

1066
01:34:24,998 --> 01:34:26,834
Space colonization could take decades.

1067
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,377
It can happen quickly with our help.

1068
01:34:28,544 --> 01:34:30,963
What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?

1069
01:34:31,129 --> 01:34:34,883
We could be responsible for billions of lives
not being created across the universe.

1070
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:36,385
Boss, am I right?

1071
01:34:38,053 --> 01:34:39,805
Say something, Ikaris.

1072
01:34:39,972 --> 01:34:41,640
You don't think we should be doing this.

1073
01:34:48,397 --> 01:34:50,774
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

1074
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:54,111
Sersi should decide.

1075
01:34:56,738 --> 01:34:58,532
Forget who Ajak chose.

1076
01:34:58,699 --> 01:35:01,869
You're the strongest.
You should be making this decision.

1077
01:35:02,953 --> 01:35:05,247
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

1078
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:06,790
Sprite.

1079
01:35:15,924 --> 01:35:17,176
Okay, this is not...

1080
01:35:17,342 --> 01:35:18,635
-Ikaris.
-Don't run after him.

1081
01:35:18,802 --> 01:35:20,804
Kingo, I...
You guys.

1082
01:35:21,221 --> 01:35:23,682
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

1083
01:35:23,849 --> 01:35:25,726
I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.

1084
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:27,227
I'm okay, Kingo.

1085
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:29,104
If you think we should do this, I trust you.

1086
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:31,940
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1087
01:35:33,942 --> 01:35:35,444
What did you say?

1088
01:35:35,694 --> 01:35:38,155
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1089
01:35:39,907 --> 01:35:42,784
I'm not who you think I am.

1090
01:36:21,114 --> 01:36:22,741
How long do we have?

1091
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:24,743
Seven days.

1092
01:36:25,285 --> 01:36:26,578
Good.

1093
01:36:28,163 --> 01:36:30,165
We completed our mission.

1094
01:36:33,001 --> 01:36:34,545
Where is she?

1095
01:36:34,711 --> 01:36:35,712
London.

1096
01:36:36,547 --> 01:36:38,131
She has a good life there.

1097
01:36:38,298 --> 01:36:40,384
I'm sure she's missed you.

1098
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:43,846
If I'd gone back to her,
I would only have told her the truth.

1099
01:36:45,681 --> 01:36:47,307
She would've suffered...

1100
01:36:47,474 --> 01:36:49,977
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

1101
01:36:50,143 --> 01:36:51,311
Ikaris.

1102
01:36:52,354 --> 01:36:54,022
We have to tell them the truth.

1103
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:55,607
What?

1104
01:36:55,983 --> 01:36:57,526
-Why?
-Because together...

1105
01:36:57,693 --> 01:36:59,778
we might be able to stop the emergence.

1106
01:37:00,529 --> 01:37:02,197
"Stop the emergence"?

1107
01:37:02,364 --> 01:37:03,365
Listen...

1108
01:37:03,532 --> 01:37:05,367
-Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...
-Listen to me, Ikaris.

1109
01:37:05,534 --> 01:37:08,579
I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

1110
01:37:08,745 --> 01:37:11,373
And I have never doubted him.

1111
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:13,208
-Until now.
-Why now?

1112
01:37:14,168 --> 01:37:15,544
Why now?

1113
01:37:20,424 --> 01:37:25,053
Five years ago, Thanos erased
half of the population of the universe.

1114
01:37:26,513 --> 01:37:28,348
Delayed the emergence.

1115
01:37:30,392 --> 01:37:32,352
But the people of this planet...

1116
01:37:32,519 --> 01:37:35,772
brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

1117
01:37:36,982 --> 01:37:40,110
You know, after I let you all go...

1118
01:37:40,277 --> 01:37:43,155
I traveled the world, living among them.

1119
01:37:43,322 --> 01:37:46,909
I have seen them fight and lie and kill...

1120
01:37:47,201 --> 01:37:49,536
but I have also seen them...

1121
01:37:49,703 --> 01:37:52,122
laugh and love.

1122
01:37:52,289 --> 01:37:56,293
I've seen them create and dream.

1123
01:37:59,505 --> 01:38:00,881
This planet...

1124
01:38:01,548 --> 01:38:03,133
and these people...

1125
01:38:04,593 --> 01:38:06,261
have changed me.

1126
01:38:07,846 --> 01:38:11,892
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

1127
01:38:12,059 --> 01:38:13,685
Not this time.

1128
01:38:15,521 --> 01:38:17,231
I trust you, Ajak.

1129
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:23,320
I'll follow you to the end...

1130
01:38:24,655 --> 01:38:26,156
as I always have.

1131
01:38:26,323 --> 01:38:27,699
Thank you.

1132
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:31,286
We have to bring everyone back together.

1133
01:38:33,914 --> 01:38:36,250
There's something I have to show you first.

1134
01:38:46,885 --> 01:38:48,554
It's just up ahead.

1135
01:38:56,061 --> 01:38:58,564
They must have been trapped in the ice
for centuries...

1136
01:38:58,730 --> 01:39:01,650
and broke free last week
when the glacier started to melt...

1137
01:39:01,817 --> 01:39:04,528
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

1138
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:08,073
They killed an entire company of oil workers.

1139
01:39:08,866 --> 01:39:10,492
I tracked them here.

1140
01:39:13,996 --> 01:39:16,331
I suspected you might have changed your mind.

1141
01:39:17,499 --> 01:39:19,543
I can't let you betray Arishem.

1142
01:39:21,253 --> 01:39:23,338
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

1143
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:26,508
When the others realize
something is happening to the Earth...

1144
01:39:27,176 --> 01:39:28,343
they'll come to you.

1145
01:39:29,052 --> 01:39:31,930
When they find your body,
they'll know the Deviants are back.

1146
01:39:32,347 --> 01:39:35,017
It'll keep them busy until the emergence.

1147
01:39:36,727 --> 01:39:39,062
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

1148
01:39:39,396 --> 01:39:41,857
Kept your secret for centuries...

1149
01:39:42,191 --> 01:39:44,943
lied to everyone I cared about...

1150
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:49,740
but never have I doubted my purpose
to serve the Celestials.

1151
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:52,367
Oh, Ikaris.

1152
01:39:57,247 --> 01:40:00,125
I've led you down the wrong path.

1153
01:40:00,918 --> 01:40:02,336
It's the only path I know.

1154
01:42:56,093 --> 01:42:58,053
Thought I'd find you here.

1155
01:42:58,554 --> 01:43:00,973
I've thought about this place a lot.

1156
01:43:02,182 --> 01:43:04,518
Amazing how things change over time.

1157
01:43:05,102 --> 01:43:07,229
Maybe we're the ones who've changed.

1158
01:43:10,065 --> 01:43:11,942
I know you don't agree with our plan.

1159
01:43:13,068 --> 01:43:16,071
I've always thought of the Celestials
like the ocean.

1160
01:43:17,906 --> 01:43:21,410
They give life
and they take life away without bias.

1161
01:43:21,827 --> 01:43:24,538
If they were gone,
this universe would eventually end.

1162
01:43:25,038 --> 01:43:27,457
What you're trying to do is free humanity
from the natural order.

1163
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:31,461
It's not natural to allow all life
on an entire planet to be destroyed.

1164
01:43:32,171 --> 01:43:33,922
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

1165
01:43:34,089 --> 01:43:36,049
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

1166
01:43:36,842 --> 01:43:37,843
It'll all end soon.

1167
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:40,846
Except there is no end, is there?

1168
01:43:41,096 --> 01:43:43,599
We'd carry on without our memories...

1169
01:43:43,765 --> 01:43:45,309
or free will...

1170
01:43:45,475 --> 01:43:47,060
for eternity.

1171
01:43:52,774 --> 01:43:54,151
You're afraid.

1172
01:43:54,568 --> 01:43:57,196
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

1173
01:43:57,905 --> 01:43:59,865
I only wish that when we do...

1174
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:03,702
I would be able to remember you.

1175
01:44:05,787 --> 01:44:08,248
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

1176
01:44:08,707 --> 01:44:11,627
I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

1177
01:44:17,799 --> 01:44:18,884
Ikaris.

1178
01:44:43,742 --> 01:44:45,035
Sersi?

1179
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:50,499
It's started.

1180
01:44:53,961 --> 01:44:55,629
Oh, no. My God.

1181
01:44:56,213 --> 01:44:57,214
What about the Uni-Mind?

1182
01:44:57,673 --> 01:45:00,425
I haven't figured out a way to connect us,
but I'm close.

1183
01:45:00,592 --> 01:45:02,135
-I'm very, very close.
-How much longer?

1184
01:45:02,302 --> 01:45:04,304
I don't know, Sersi!

1185
01:45:07,516 --> 01:45:08,851
Find the point of emergence.

1186
01:45:32,749 --> 01:45:35,335
You always knew the end was coming.

1187
01:45:35,502 --> 01:45:38,130
It must be a relief.

1188
01:45:38,297 --> 01:45:40,299
That Deviant is still tracking us.

1189
01:45:41,008 --> 01:45:43,552
Revenge won't bring peace for you, Thena.

1190
01:45:44,052 --> 01:45:46,263
But killing it might.

1191
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:00,777
Ikaris?

1192
01:46:02,196 --> 01:46:03,655
What are you doing?

1193
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:12,247
I wanted you to leave this world in peace.

1194
01:46:13,624 --> 01:46:16,043
Without knowing about the emergence.

1195
01:46:16,418 --> 01:46:18,003
But I failed.

1196
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,550
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

1197
01:46:30,766 --> 01:46:32,100
I'm close to figuring it out.

1198
01:46:36,605 --> 01:46:37,898
Boss, what are you doing?

1199
01:46:38,065 --> 01:46:39,566
I've let this go on long enough.

1200
01:46:39,733 --> 01:46:40,651
Don't hurt him!

1201
01:46:42,778 --> 01:46:44,363
He lied to us.

1202
01:46:45,239 --> 01:46:46,990
He already knew about the emergence.

1203
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:49,034
No, he didn't.

1204
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:51,912
Ajak told me everything when we left Babylon.

1205
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:54,289
What?

1206
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:57,668
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

1207
01:46:57,835 --> 01:46:58,836
No.

1208
01:47:00,128 --> 01:47:02,798
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

1209
01:47:02,965 --> 01:47:06,260
If Ajak wanted you to take her place,
why did she choose me?

1210
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:12,641
What have you done?

1211
01:47:13,976 --> 01:47:15,602
He killed her.

1212
01:47:18,355 --> 01:47:19,356
I had to.

1213
01:47:20,774 --> 01:47:22,651
She loved you.

1214
01:47:25,445 --> 01:47:27,114
-Did she?
-She loved you.

1215
01:47:29,491 --> 01:47:31,827
Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

1216
01:47:32,828 --> 01:47:34,830
To know that one day all this would end?

1217
01:47:36,957 --> 01:47:39,334
To keep on lying to you?

1218
01:47:40,794 --> 01:47:42,880
If we gave humanity the choice...

1219
01:47:43,046 --> 01:47:48,135
how many of them would be willing to die
so that billions more could be born?

1220
01:47:48,302 --> 01:47:50,679
We're not giving them a choice.

1221
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:54,808
Is this why you're willing to kill?

1222
01:47:55,809 --> 01:47:58,478
You are so pathetic!

1223
01:47:58,896 --> 01:48:01,190
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

1224
01:48:01,815 --> 01:48:04,860
I exist for Arishem.

1225
01:48:05,027 --> 01:48:06,278
As do you.

1226
01:48:06,778 --> 01:48:07,779
It's who you are.

1227
01:48:07,946 --> 01:48:12,618
I wouldn't change a single thing
about who I am.

1228
01:48:12,784 --> 01:48:14,745
Born or made.

1229
01:48:14,912 --> 01:48:17,164
But I do not exist for Arishem...

1230
01:48:17,331 --> 01:48:19,291
I exist for my family!

1231
01:48:19,458 --> 01:48:21,919
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

1232
01:48:24,963 --> 01:48:26,173
-No!
-Makkari!

1233
01:48:28,509 --> 01:48:29,968
Get out of here!

1234
01:48:33,013 --> 01:48:34,389
Kingo.

1235
01:48:42,314 --> 01:48:44,900
You do not turn against your family.

1236
01:48:45,817 --> 01:48:48,195
Gilgamesh died because of you.

1237
01:48:50,113 --> 01:48:51,573
You won't succeed against me.

1238
01:48:52,574 --> 01:48:55,160
And I will kill every one of you
if I have to.

1239
01:49:02,918 --> 01:49:04,044
Wait.

1240
01:49:05,003 --> 01:49:06,046
I'm going with you.

1241
01:49:06,213 --> 01:49:07,256
Sprite...

1242
01:49:09,049 --> 01:49:10,092
What is this?

1243
01:49:27,609 --> 01:49:29,444
Because she loves him.

1244
01:49:31,238 --> 01:49:33,699
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

1245
01:49:34,867 --> 01:49:37,035
He really fooled us, didn't he?

1246
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:39,204
Karun, let's go.

1247
01:49:39,746 --> 01:49:40,956
Wait, where the hell are you going?

1248
01:49:41,123 --> 01:49:43,041
I can't help you guys.

1249
01:49:44,084 --> 01:49:45,711
I still think Ikaris is right.

1250
01:49:45,878 --> 01:49:48,922
So, that's it, huh? Just gonna follow him?

1251
01:49:49,715 --> 01:49:51,717
I love the people of this planet.

1252
01:49:52,176 --> 01:49:54,469
But if you stop this emergence...

1253
01:49:54,636 --> 01:49:57,014
you are preventing
so many other worlds like this one...

1254
01:49:57,181 --> 01:49:58,765
from being created.

1255
01:49:59,474 --> 01:50:01,310
I still have faith in Arishem.

1256
01:50:01,768 --> 01:50:04,938
But I refuse to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

1257
01:50:10,903 --> 01:50:13,488
Even with my help, we're no match.

1258
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:15,908
It's Ikaris.

1259
01:50:19,286 --> 01:50:20,287
But...

1260
01:50:21,079 --> 01:50:22,956
I hope to see you on the next planet.

1261
01:50:50,609 --> 01:50:51,610
Look...

1262
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:55,322
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris...

1263
01:50:56,114 --> 01:50:57,991
we'll need to have a backup plan.

1264
01:50:58,158 --> 01:50:59,868
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified...

1265
01:51:00,035 --> 01:51:01,411
are not enough to kill a Celestial, so...

1266
01:51:01,578 --> 01:51:04,122
Well, Sersi did turn a Deviant into a tree.

1267
01:51:05,123 --> 01:51:06,250
I'm sorry, what?

1268
01:51:06,917 --> 01:51:08,377
You didn't wanna tell me that?

1269
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:11,839
I don't know how it happened, okay?

1270
01:51:12,005 --> 01:51:14,424
And I'm pretty sure I couldn't do it again.

1271
01:51:14,591 --> 01:51:17,135
Well, now is the time to try,
don't you think?

1272
01:51:17,302 --> 01:51:19,263
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

1273
01:51:19,429 --> 01:51:22,641
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep,
not to kill it.

1274
01:51:22,808 --> 01:51:24,184
I can't kill a Celestial.

1275
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:25,978
Sersi. Sersi.

1276
01:51:26,144 --> 01:51:27,521
We can't!

1277
01:51:33,485 --> 01:51:34,611
We can't.

1278
01:51:34,778 --> 01:51:36,321
It's okay, Sersi.

1279
01:51:37,656 --> 01:51:39,032
I got this.

1280
01:51:55,257 --> 01:51:56,884
There's no time for that.

1281
01:51:58,051 --> 01:52:00,762
I didn't see the lies right in front of me.

1282
01:52:02,055 --> 01:52:04,933
I'm not even sure why Ajak chose me to lead.

1283
01:52:06,476 --> 01:52:08,020
I asked Gilgamesh once...

1284
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,856
why he chose to protect me.

1285
01:52:11,273 --> 01:52:12,691
He said...

1286
01:52:13,150 --> 01:52:16,486
"When you love something, you protect it.

1287
01:52:17,196 --> 01:52:21,825
"It is the most natural thing in the world."

1288
01:52:24,494 --> 01:52:29,041
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

1289
01:52:30,459 --> 01:52:35,881
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

1290
01:52:38,383 --> 01:52:39,676
Sersi.

1291
01:52:41,929 --> 01:52:43,263
Get up.

1292
01:52:51,188 --> 01:52:53,649
Ajak chose you for a reason.

1293
01:52:58,904 --> 01:52:59,863
Sersi!

1294
01:53:00,322 --> 01:53:01,365
Sersi!

1295
01:53:01,532 --> 01:53:03,116
Sersi. We need you!

1296
01:53:03,283 --> 01:53:04,826
I already gave that speech.

1297
01:53:04,993 --> 01:53:06,036
What?

1298
01:53:06,203 --> 01:53:07,454
You did... What...

1299
01:53:07,621 --> 01:53:10,624
Sersi, the sphere inside of you...

1300
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:12,334
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

1301
01:53:12,501 --> 01:53:15,629
Maybe I can repurpose it...

1302
01:53:15,796 --> 01:53:18,048
and create a connection between...

1303
01:53:18,549 --> 01:53:19,550
well, all of us.

1304
01:53:20,008 --> 01:53:22,302
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

1305
01:53:22,469 --> 01:53:24,137
-Great.
-Yeah.

1306
01:53:24,847 --> 01:53:26,098
But...

1307
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,976
I have to take it out of you.

1308
01:53:31,895 --> 01:53:33,105
Okay.

1309
01:53:34,606 --> 01:53:35,691
Do it.

1310
01:53:37,317 --> 01:53:38,443
Okay.

1311
01:53:46,451 --> 01:53:48,036
Don't kill her.

1312
01:53:48,203 --> 01:53:49,413
Thena...

1313
01:53:50,664 --> 01:53:51,707
Do it.

1314
01:54:05,387 --> 01:54:06,680
Will it work?

1315
01:54:11,393 --> 01:54:12,811
It has to.

1316
01:55:04,613 --> 01:55:06,406
I'm glad you're here.

1317
01:55:10,619 --> 01:55:12,204
Thank you, Sprite.

1318
01:55:27,052 --> 01:55:28,720
Protect the emergence.

1319
01:55:28,887 --> 01:55:30,639
You're really gonna kill them?

1320
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,023
Where's Druig?

1321
01:55:40,566 --> 01:55:41,775
He's busy.

1322
01:55:41,942 --> 01:55:44,027
Thena, play nice.

1323
01:55:47,823 --> 01:55:49,241
You've never had to fight me.

1324
01:55:49,408 --> 01:55:50,534
But I've always wanted to.

1325
01:55:58,959 --> 01:56:01,170
It's time to put a god to sleep.

1326
01:57:08,612 --> 01:57:10,447
I should've done this five centuries ago.

1327
01:57:57,786 --> 01:57:59,288
Druig's gone.

1328
01:58:00,205 --> 01:58:01,582
It's over.

1329
01:59:09,107 --> 01:59:09,942
Phastos.

1330
01:59:14,363 --> 01:59:16,156
I have to try and stop this.

1331
01:59:16,323 --> 01:59:18,075
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

1332
01:59:18,242 --> 01:59:20,035
-Keep Ikaris busy.
-We've got you.

1333
01:59:20,202 --> 01:59:21,203
Go.

1334
01:59:30,045 --> 01:59:30,963
Enough.

1335
02:00:01,159 --> 02:00:02,411
Thena, stop!

1336
02:00:34,526 --> 02:00:35,903
Why are you helping Ikaris?

1337
02:00:36,778 --> 02:00:38,155
We can't let it absorb our powers.

1338
02:00:39,489 --> 02:00:40,616
Too late.

1339
02:00:42,284 --> 02:00:44,912
Thena, he's trying to goad you. Don't...

1340
02:01:00,802 --> 02:01:01,803
Makkari!

1341
02:01:10,979 --> 02:01:12,189
Where's Sersi?

1342
02:01:12,564 --> 02:01:14,733
You always did underestimate her.

1343
02:01:16,193 --> 02:01:17,444
Oh, no.

1344
02:01:18,278 --> 02:01:19,905
Not so fast.

1345
02:01:24,368 --> 02:01:25,744
Boss.

1346
02:01:29,915 --> 02:01:32,793
I don't know about you,
but this is really satisfying, right?

1347
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:35,295
Let me go, Phastos! I can't let her do this!

1348
02:01:35,462 --> 02:01:36,755
I don't think so.

1349
02:01:37,172 --> 02:01:40,634
I've been wanting to clip your wings
for a long time, Ikaris!

1350
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:54,940
Thena.

1351
02:01:57,651 --> 02:02:00,571
Oh, you've changed.

1352
02:02:01,947 --> 02:02:03,574
You're broken.

1353
02:02:04,408 --> 02:02:05,909
Damaged.

1354
02:02:06,493 --> 02:02:08,328
Useless.

1355
02:02:10,581 --> 02:02:14,418
You can't protect any of them.

1356
02:02:28,348 --> 02:02:29,725
Sersi.

1357
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:37,399
You're not powerful enough to do this.

1358
02:02:37,566 --> 02:02:39,484
And you won't.

1359
02:02:39,902 --> 02:02:41,653
You're not a killer.

1360
02:02:41,820 --> 02:02:43,405
Maybe I've changed.

1361
02:02:43,864 --> 02:02:46,366
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

1362
02:02:46,533 --> 02:02:49,161
Are you really willing
to let everyone on this planet die?

1363
02:02:57,961 --> 02:02:59,755
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1364
02:03:12,226 --> 02:03:14,436
I've always envied you, Sersi.

1365
02:03:16,522 --> 02:03:18,565
'Cause you get to live as one of them.

1366
02:03:19,107 --> 02:03:20,192
And I never could.

1367
02:03:21,443 --> 02:03:23,695
You know why I hated living with humans?

1368
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:27,074
Because they reminded me of
things I didn't even know I wanted.

1369
02:03:27,574 --> 02:03:30,953
Because of them, now I wanna know
what it feels like to grow up.

1370
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:33,789
To fall in love.

1371
02:03:34,581 --> 02:03:36,208
To have a family.

1372
02:03:37,501 --> 02:03:41,171
And to know, in the end, I've lived.

1373
02:03:48,303 --> 02:03:49,429
It's all over now.

1374
02:03:50,264 --> 02:03:52,599
We get to start over somewhere new.

1375
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:58,146
Well, that was very moving.

1376
02:03:58,313 --> 02:03:59,565
Druig.

1377
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:06,822
I can't do this.

1378
02:04:10,492 --> 02:04:12,369
This is your fight now.

1379
02:04:56,955 --> 02:04:58,165
Thena.

1380
02:04:59,541 --> 02:05:00,792
It's me.

1381
02:05:01,376 --> 02:05:02,544
Gilgamesh.

1382
02:05:03,962 --> 02:05:05,005
Look at me.

1383
02:05:06,048 --> 02:05:07,341
Gilgamesh?

1384
02:05:07,508 --> 02:05:09,051
Stay here.

1385
02:05:11,762 --> 02:05:13,013
Say it.

1386
02:05:13,555 --> 02:05:15,224
Stay here.

1387
02:05:16,099 --> 02:05:17,809
You'll be okay.

1388
02:05:19,853 --> 02:05:21,688
Give me your hand.

1389
02:05:34,993 --> 02:05:36,203
It's a shame.

1390
02:05:38,247 --> 02:05:39,873
You and I...

1391
02:05:40,457 --> 02:05:42,376
we're just tools of a god.

1392
02:05:43,752 --> 02:05:46,964
Built to kill.

1393
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:51,051
Thena.

1394
02:05:54,513 --> 02:05:55,889
Remember.

1395
02:06:26,378 --> 02:06:27,963
I remember.

1396
02:07:57,261 --> 02:07:58,720
Come on, Sersi.

1397
02:07:59,763 --> 02:08:00,848
Come on.

1398
02:10:10,018 --> 02:10:11,770
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1399
02:12:40,919 --> 02:12:42,462
I'm sorry.

1400
02:12:44,173 --> 02:12:45,632
I know.

1401
02:14:01,208 --> 02:14:02,251
How?

1402
02:14:02,709 --> 02:14:04,086
How did you do it?

1403
02:14:05,212 --> 02:14:08,465
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

1404
02:14:08,882 --> 02:14:11,260
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

1405
02:14:11,426 --> 02:14:12,761
I always wondered how we survived...

1406
02:14:12,928 --> 02:14:15,597
the destruction of other planets
that we were on.

1407
02:14:15,973 --> 02:14:18,475
By being connected to the Celestial
as it emerged.

1408
02:15:22,206 --> 02:15:23,415
Is he gone?

1409
02:15:33,091 --> 02:15:34,343
Sprite.

1410
02:15:36,845 --> 02:15:39,431
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

1411
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:42,559
I think I can make you human.

1412
02:15:43,936 --> 02:15:46,855
All the things you said you wanted,
you can have them.

1413
02:15:47,022 --> 02:15:49,900
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

1414
02:15:50,067 --> 02:15:51,109
Are you ready for that?

1415
02:15:53,529 --> 02:15:54,947
I am.

1416
02:16:32,359 --> 02:16:34,486
{\an8}<i>The sudden appearance of an enormous
stone figure in the Indian Ocean...</i>

1417
02:16:36,154 --> 02:16:38,949
{\an8}<i>...has left more questions than answers
for authorities.</i>

1418
02:16:39,825 --> 02:16:43,327
<i>U.S. and Australian naval ships
are maintaining defensive positions...</i>

1419
02:16:43,495 --> 02:16:44,495
<i>but at this...</i>

1420
02:16:44,663 --> 02:16:46,540
You guys did that?

1421
02:16:47,332 --> 02:16:49,626
I love you so much.

1422
02:16:56,924 --> 02:16:58,302
Are you okay?

1423
02:16:59,218 --> 02:17:01,221
I get confused sometimes.

1424
02:17:01,388 --> 02:17:03,432
Yeah. Me, too.

1425
02:17:06,018 --> 02:17:08,312
So, Dad said you're the goddess Athena.

1426
02:17:08,477 --> 02:17:10,564
"Thena." Drop the "A."

1427
02:17:13,483 --> 02:17:15,318
What's your superpower?

1428
02:17:19,198 --> 02:17:21,450
Can you just... Look... One second.

1429
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:23,826
Okay. All right.

1430
02:17:24,369 --> 02:17:26,079
See, that thing is... Okay.

1431
02:17:26,245 --> 02:17:27,748
Almost gave you a shave and a haircut,
didn't she?

1432
02:17:27,915 --> 02:17:29,374
Stand behind me, actually.

1433
02:17:29,540 --> 02:17:31,502
You remember earmuffs?
Remember how we practiced earmuffs?

1434
02:17:31,668 --> 02:17:33,378
Thank you so much.

1435
02:17:35,547 --> 02:17:38,258
You know that your babysitting privileges
are completely revoked, right?

1436
02:17:38,424 --> 02:17:39,468
Like, it's done.

1437
02:17:39,968 --> 02:17:41,844
Thank you. Violence... Hey.

1438
02:17:42,012 --> 02:17:44,848
Violence is never the answer.
Right, T?

1439
02:17:45,014 --> 02:17:47,643
You gotta always use your brain.

1440
02:17:47,808 --> 02:17:49,520
Like you did fighting on the beach?

1441
02:17:49,686 --> 02:17:50,938
Your dad...

1442
02:17:51,103 --> 02:17:53,482
spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy...

1443
02:17:53,648 --> 02:17:55,150
and he had no choice but to listen to me,
so no violence.

1444
02:17:59,237 --> 02:18:00,739
When are you guys leaving?
When is that happening?

1445
02:18:00,906 --> 02:18:02,782
That's happening soon, right?

1446
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:05,786
Yes, there's Druig.
Don't go anywhere near him.

1447
02:18:06,327 --> 02:18:07,454
Yeah!

1448
02:18:09,873 --> 02:18:11,208
Okay, that's far enough, Jack.

1449
02:18:11,375 --> 02:18:13,709
Wow, Dad, the <i>Domo</i>'s so cool.

1450
02:18:13,877 --> 02:18:15,504
Your dad fixed that with his bare hands.

1451
02:18:15,671 --> 02:18:17,255
Can we go to space, too, one day?

1452
02:18:17,422 --> 02:18:19,924
Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

1453
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,218
Hey, Phastos.

1454
02:18:23,053 --> 02:18:24,429
Take care.

1455
02:18:24,805 --> 02:18:26,389
This world is lucky to have you.

1456
02:18:27,224 --> 02:18:28,851
Thank you.

1457
02:18:29,017 --> 02:18:30,686
I know you're not a hugger, so...

1458
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:34,940
Okay.

1459
02:18:37,901 --> 02:18:41,989
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there...

1460
02:18:42,155 --> 02:18:45,157
that they'll accept the truth the way we did?

1461
02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:04,761
Told you that thing was addictive.

1462
02:19:05,929 --> 02:19:06,972
Please visit?

1463
02:19:07,598 --> 02:19:08,807
I'll try.

1464
02:19:09,391 --> 02:19:10,726
When I get time off from school.

1465
02:19:10,893 --> 02:19:13,562
Oh, wow. Listen, it's gonna be good for you
to be in a human environment.

1466
02:19:13,728 --> 02:19:15,522
You'll pick up some social skills.

1467
02:19:16,064 --> 02:19:17,441
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

1468
02:19:18,816 --> 02:19:20,818
That explains so much.

1469
02:19:30,537 --> 02:19:32,080
Gonna miss you.

1470
02:19:32,623 --> 02:19:33,832
Me, too.

1471
02:19:37,503 --> 02:19:38,629
Madam.

1472
02:19:39,087 --> 02:19:40,379
Thanks, Karun.

1473
02:19:40,964 --> 02:19:43,424
Sometimes I wonder if we did the right thing.

1474
02:19:45,052 --> 02:19:46,136
Killing Tiamut.

1475
02:19:46,303 --> 02:19:48,055
It's too late for that.

1476
02:19:48,222 --> 02:19:50,182
But you followed your heart.

1477
02:19:50,349 --> 02:19:51,808
We all did.

1478
02:19:54,019 --> 02:19:55,020
Even Ikaris.

1479
02:20:02,611 --> 02:20:04,571
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

1480
02:20:05,739 --> 02:20:07,866
He's a lot cuter in person.

1481
02:20:10,285 --> 02:20:13,497
So, after all that,
you still can't change me into a giraffe?

1482
02:20:14,164 --> 02:20:17,835
Well, I could next time
I'm connected to a Celestial...

1483
02:20:18,001 --> 02:20:20,212
during an emergence
whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

1484
02:20:20,379 --> 02:20:23,173
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

1485
02:20:27,135 --> 02:20:28,554
What'll you do now?

1486
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:30,013
Not sure.

1487
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:32,182
This planet's my home, but...

1488
02:20:33,934 --> 02:20:36,645
I can't pretend to be human anymore.

1489
02:20:43,235 --> 02:20:44,820
I love you, Sersi.

1490
02:20:46,363 --> 02:20:47,447
I don't care what you are.

1491
02:21:01,253 --> 02:21:03,881
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

1492
02:21:04,047 --> 02:21:07,050
I have no more secrets, I promise.

1493
02:21:07,217 --> 02:21:08,719
Actually...

1494
02:21:08,886 --> 02:21:11,180
I have one I want to tell you.

1495
02:21:12,264 --> 02:21:13,807
What is it?

1496
02:21:15,767 --> 02:21:18,270
It turns out my family history is...

1497
02:21:19,188 --> 02:21:20,772
complicated.

1498
02:21:24,193 --> 02:21:25,569
Sersi?

1499
02:21:26,361 --> 02:21:27,863
Sersi, what's wrong?

1500
02:21:29,323 --> 02:21:30,657
Sersi?

1501
02:21:54,473 --> 02:21:55,849
Sersi?

1502
02:21:56,725 --> 02:21:57,976
Sersi?

1503
02:21:58,852 --> 02:22:01,021
Sersi!

1504
02:22:15,827 --> 02:22:19,206
You have chosen to sacrifice a Celestial...

1505
02:22:19,581 --> 02:22:22,000
for the people of this planet.

1506
02:22:23,293 --> 02:22:25,087
I will spare them...

1507
02:22:25,254 --> 02:22:29,967
but your memories will show
if they're worthy to live.

1508
02:22:31,468 --> 02:22:35,681
And I will return for judgment.

1509
02:22:51,071 --> 02:22:53,115
You all right, Ted?

1510
02:22:54,825 --> 02:22:56,702
Did you see that?

1511
02:26:06,308 --> 02:26:07,643
Arishem.

1512
02:26:09,895 --> 02:26:11,605
We have to go back.

1513
02:26:24,576 --> 02:26:25,911
What?

1514
02:26:38,799 --> 02:26:39,883
Wow.

1515
02:26:40,759 --> 02:26:43,387
My ears. My eyes are numb.

1516
02:26:43,554 --> 02:26:46,390
No more drunk teleporting for you.

1517
02:26:47,724 --> 02:26:48,892
Hang on, hang on.

1518
02:26:54,773 --> 02:26:56,233
Behold...

1519
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:59,486
the royal prince of Titan...

1520
02:26:59,653 --> 02:27:02,865
brother of Thanos, the Knave of Hearts...

1521
02:27:03,031 --> 02:27:04,116
defeater...

1522
02:27:05,450 --> 02:27:07,411
-...of Black Robert...
-Roger.

1523
02:27:09,329 --> 02:27:11,790
Defeater of Black Roger.

1524
02:27:12,416 --> 02:27:13,709
The great adventurer...

1525
02:27:14,251 --> 02:27:18,172
Starfox of Mystery Planet.

1526
02:27:18,755 --> 02:27:20,966
What a pleasure to make your acquaintance...

1527
02:27:21,508 --> 02:27:23,385
my fellow Eternals.

1528
02:27:24,428 --> 02:27:26,763
You know, you really don't have to
do the whole thing every time.

1529
02:27:26,930 --> 02:27:28,140
Everything you do is impressive.

1530
02:27:28,307 --> 02:27:29,308
-What am I gonna leave off the list?
-No, I know it's impressive.

1531
02:27:29,558 --> 02:27:30,559
Who are you?

1532
02:27:32,811 --> 02:27:33,937
I'm Eros.

1533
02:27:34,438 --> 02:27:35,480
This is Pip.

1534
02:27:35,898 --> 02:27:39,109
And you are as beautiful
as legends say, Thena.

1535
02:27:39,276 --> 02:27:40,569
What do you want, lads?

1536
02:27:40,736 --> 02:27:42,404
Pip and I are here to help,
aren't we?

1537
02:27:47,868 --> 02:27:49,953
Your friends are in big trouble.

1538
02:27:51,622 --> 02:27:53,707
And we know where to find them.

1539
02:34:45,118 --> 02:34:46,578
You can do this.

1540
02:34:47,829 --> 02:34:49,665
You can do this.

1541
02:35:13,939 --> 02:35:15,440
I'm sorry.

1542
02:35:17,651 --> 02:35:19,278
I have to try.

1543
02:35:33,375 --> 02:35:35,961
Sure you're ready for that, Mr. Whitman?

1544
02:35:42,089 --> 02:35:47,089
