2
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,680
So I'm gonna get
a three-to-one return on my money?

3
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Man: Otto is the reaI deaI.
I met him at a hash bar in Amsterdam.

4
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,560
He speaks Russian, German, Arabic...

5
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,000
Otto: Mr. Ostroff's trust
is not gained easiIy.

6
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,800
Two years it took me.

7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,400
You see, Micky,
he doesn't Iike new faces.

8
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,760
So teII me, why am I
Iooking at a new face?

9
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,680
Otto Krieg, meet my friend, Bobby.

10
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,160
He's heIping me with the finance.

11
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,120
He's not a cop.

12
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's see the money.

13
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,280
( speaking Russian )

14
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,800
You Iike it?

15
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,440
Yeah, I Iike it.

16
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,960
- We have deaI?
- We have deaI.

17
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,560
( sirens bIaring )

18
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,000
- Agent: Bring 'em down!
- Agent #2: Move!

19
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,400
Agent #3: Move in!

20
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,160
P.A.:
This is the FBI!

21
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,960
Put your hands on your head!

22
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,320
What is this?

23
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
You brought a cop, and
he brought his fucking friends!

24
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,960
- Don't Iook at me.
- This is not good.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,240
My father wiII kiII me!

26
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,640
You're under arrest for the importation
and saIe of contraband firearms.

27
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,640
Scheisse!

28
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,240
- Agent #5: Gun!
- Agent #6: Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

29
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,080
Otto!

31
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,840
This is not my deaI.
This is not my deaI!

32
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,400
I don't even know these guys!

33
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,000
Agent #7: Cease fire!

34
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,400
HoIy shit. HoIy shit.

35
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,960
Bobby!

36
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,360
Bobby!

37
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,000
Stay down!

38
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm caIIing it. It's 1 :37 AM.

39
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,120
- Bag him and ship him.
- ( sirens sounding )

40
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,240
God, I hate this job.

41
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,360
- Give me a hand, feIIas.
- Yeah.

42
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,040
AII right, Frank.
We gotta get you outta here.

43
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
What the heII happened?
Who's the kid?

44
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,560
DefiniteIy not in the pIan.
But we beat the spread.

45
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,480
- This isn't footbaII.
- It's a figure of speech.

46
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,960
PeopIe weren't supposed
to die out there.

47
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,680
Get them IDed
and get them to the morgue.

48
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,400
- And get me my pants!
- Can we get some pants over here?

49
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,120
Ah, shit.

50
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,640
AII: Surprise!

51
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,240
To Frank CastIe...
the finest soIdier,

52
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,240
the finest undercover op,

53
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,760
the finest man I've ever known.

54
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,480
What am I gonna do without you?

55
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,040
- Get a girIfriend.
- ( aII Iaugh )

56
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
Have fun in Puerto Rico, man.
Say heIIo to your foIks.

57
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,880
Thanks.

58
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,400
Agent Weeks.

59
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
He's Robert Saint.
Howard Saint's son.

60
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,760
More paperwork for Tampa PD.

61
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,960
( chuckIes )
No, we can handIe this.

62
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,680
- Weeks: See you, buddy!
- See you, feIIas!

63
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,040
( woman gasps )

64
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,720
BaiI him now.
Bring him to the cIub.

65
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,440
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

66
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,680
- Hey, Micky.
- Don't hit me.

67
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,800
( coughing )

68
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,720
( grunting )

69
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,960
You seII homegrown pot by the ounce,
Micky, not by the barreI.

70
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,040
You seII badIy forged,
fake passports to Haitians.

71
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,160
So what inspired you to become...

72
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,840
the Mr. Universe
of internationaI arms deaIers?

73
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,160
You shouId apoIogize for the death
of Mr. Saint's youngest chiId.

74
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,240
Okay, I know how it Iooks...

75
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,360
But Bobby, he buys pot from me.

76
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
And when he found out what I was doing,
he insisted on coming in.

77
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,600
He put up haIf the cash.
He came of his own free wiII.

78
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,720
If you're gonna kiII me,
wiII you Ieave my face aIone,

79
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,160
for my mother?

80
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,040
We just made your baiI.

81
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,200
If I wanted to kiII you, I wouId have
Ieft you in jaiI where we have friends,

82
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,960
and in some way that I can onIy
describe as deepIy pornographic,

83
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,440
you wouId have been kiIIed.
But you're a smaII piece of shit,

84
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,800
and I don't want the karma
of your death on my souI.

85
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,400
But on the other hand,
maybe I don't beIieve in karma,

86
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,480
- so guys--
- No, I'II teII you what I want to know.

87
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,680
I want to know one thing onIy,
who brokered the deaI?

88
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,920
His name is Otto Krieg.

89
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,360
And if it's any comfort
to Mr. Saint, he's dead too.

90
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,560
WeII, it's not.
It's actuaIIy no comfort at aII.

91
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,280
But what might be comforting to me,
is to watch the sIow death of the man

92
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,200
who was supposed
to be taking care of my son,

93
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,800
and making sure that
he did not get into troubIe.

94
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,000
Now, Micky...

95
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,760
what wouId your father
think of this?

96
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,920
Your father gave his Iife for me.

97
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,000
What wouId he say?

98
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,240
I didn't know it was
gonna happen Iike this. PIease!

99
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,720
WeII, ignorance is no excuse.

100
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,520
The man who is responsibIe
for my son's death must die.

101
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,400
( grunting )

102
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,800
Saint: I toId you to never
Iet him out of your sight.

103
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,680
Mr. Saint, Bobby toId me to stay.

104
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,560
TeII him, John.
John!

105
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,680
Thug: Mr. Saint!
It was Bobby's idea!

106
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,480
He wanted to go aIone!
He thought he couId impress you.

107
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,320
Thank you for that expIanation.

108
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
My son didn't need to impress me.

109
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
More boxes, guys.

110
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,680
This was a hard one.

111
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,160
This was the Iast one.

112
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,360
( giggIes )

113
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,200
( sighs )
It's over.

114
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,600
TeII that to your son.
He doesn't beIieve me.

115
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,240
- Where is he?
- You know.

116
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,560
You know what I miss
most about Buck?

117
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,640
He couId catch a baII,

118
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,040
no matter how hard you threw it.

119
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,600
He was right there.

120
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,120
- Boy: Why are we aIways moving?
- This is the Iast time.

121
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,880
You said that Iast time.

122
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,880
I did?

123
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,080
Yeah.

124
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,480
You said we were Ieaving CaIifornia

125
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,240
and we were gonna move to Virginia,

126
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,480
and you'd work in Washington...

127
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,080
and we'd never move again.

128
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,080
( sighs )
I guess I've said a Iot of things, huh?

129
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,480
So why London?

130
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,320
London's a safe pIace
where we can aII be together.

131
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,920
No more more moving around,
I promise.

132
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,680
Some day when you're oIder, WiII...

133
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,960
I'II teII you why we had
to move so much.

134
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,840
He was such a speciaI boy.

135
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,640
Are you identifying this body
as your son, Robert Saint?

136
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,600
He deserved better.

137
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,400
Somebody Iied to him.

138
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,520
Promised him one thing,
gave him another.

139
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Do you know that I used to have
to dress him tiII he was 1 3?

140
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,760
I'd tie his ties, and comb his hair...

141
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,080
I'II have to get him a new suit.

142
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
Who is Otto Krieg?

143
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,720
Who are the peopIe
who work for him?

144
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,600
Who are his friends?

145
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,120
Who wouId stand to make money
from this deaI? TeII me.

146
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,280
We can't taIk about the case, Mr. Saint.

147
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,640
Now, I understand your grief,
but for your own safety,

148
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,000
Ieave this to professionaIs.

149
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
ProfessionaIs. Yes...

150
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,560
I'II do that.

151
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,400
( whispers )
I'II do that.

152
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,360
Good bye, son.

153
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,600
Man: We caIIed New York, we caIIed
Las Vegas, we caIIed Europe

154
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,640
and Hong Kong, we even got
the SiciIians in it for oId time's sake.

155
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,920
With what you're paying Howard,
we'II know everything

156
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,800
about Otto Krieg within 24 hours.

157
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,600
High five.

158
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,560
- Come on.
- That was cooI!

159
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,160
Leave it. We'II be back.

160
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,960
- Race you?
- Yeah.

161
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,640
Got anything Ieft?

162
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,640
I don't see it!
Come on!

163
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,440
He did his free ascent
on the first try.

164
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,920
I've seen Navy SEALs do worse.

165
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,880
- That's what we Iike to hear.
- I'm so proud of you.

166
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,400
Good job, babe.

167
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,640
Hey, Frank,
is that that CandeIaria?

168
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
Frank:Yeah, ManueI.

169
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,760
PeopIe around here
caII him a witch doctor.

170
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,200
He Iives on that isIand
way off the point.

171
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,880
OnIy one damn fooI I know
crazy enough to swim over there.

172
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,840
- ( aII chuckIing )
- Gee, Iet me guess.

173
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,880
- ( aII chatting )
- ( gIass cIinking )

174
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,080
This is the first famiIy reunion
we've had in five years.

175
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,400
And that's too Iong.
That's too Iong.

176
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,680
- ( aII appIaud )
- Amen.

177
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,120
Mr. CastIe: Two famiIies and
when you put them together,

178
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,680
you get this: my grandson!

179
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,320
I just want to say that...

180
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,080
I'm very happy that you're aII here.

181
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,440
I'm very proud that you're aII here.
And that...

182
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,240
I Iove you.

183
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,200
Love you, too, Dad.

184
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,000
- SaIud!
- AII: SaIud!

185
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,160
Hey!

186
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,000
- Hey.
- What happened? What's wrong?

187
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,240
You know...

188
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,520
I can't beIieve I'm home...

189
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,400
and that I couId ever be so Iucky.

190
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,640
Because there were times,
Maria, I gotta teII you--

191
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,520
Frank...

192
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,960
I Iost so much time,
with both of you.

193
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,600
- And I'm reaIIy sorry--
- Stop. Hey, hey, hey.

194
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,880
I married you.
I knew what I was doing...

195
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,560
and I'd do it again.

196
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,200
You and I, we're not Iucky,

197
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
we are bIessed.

198
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,360
( beIIs ringing )

199
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,560
I'II see you at home, son.

200
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,880
His name's Frank CastIe.

201
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,240
Senior agent.
Just got the Bureau's London desk.

202
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,440
His aIias, connections,
apartments in Europe,

203
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,240
none of it was reaI,

204
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,920
not even his death.

205
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,080
WeII, maybe it was.
Maybe...

206
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,680
he died and came back to Iife
so he couId die again.

207
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,560
You have your chance.

208
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,560
He's Ieaving
for EngIand next week

209
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,560
and he's at a famiIy reunion
in Puerto Rico.

210
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,680
I think you shouId be there

211
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,360
so you can come back
and teII Livia how he died.

212
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,560
- AII right.
- Livia: Wait.

213
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,640
His famiIy.

214
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,440
His whoIe famiIy.

215
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,200
Is this what you want?

216
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,680
- Morning.
- Hey.

217
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,040
Frank: We shouId have another.

218
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,440
I'm ready.

219
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
Another what?

220
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,000
- Good morning, WiII.
- Come here.

221
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,680
They were seIIing
T-shirts in town.

222
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,680
One of them was reaIIy scary.

223
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,320
The guy in the shop said
it wards off eviI spirits.

224
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,160
It's reaIIy intense.

225
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,920
- You know about this?
- Mm-hm.

226
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,920
Let's see here...

227
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,400
This is interesting.

228
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,920
- Like it?
- Like it?

229
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,920
I Iove it.

230
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,240
Thanks.

231
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,720
- ( chattering )
- ( music pIaying )

232
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,640
Nice.

233
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,920
Here you go.
Where's the camera? Okay.

234
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,440
- Come on! You've gotta see this!
- What?

235
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,320
Your 1911 CoIts,
you've done something to them.

236
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,560
You couId say that.

237
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,240
I bore the chambers
and customized the triggers

238
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,680
and added some compensators.
They used to be pretty good,

239
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,840
- but now they're naiI drivers.
- Let's see.

240
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,160
Hey, Mom!

241
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,840
- Look.
- Wow!

242
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,480
- Look at that. It's a stingray.
- Yeah.

243
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,760
- ( gun shot )
- ( screaming )

244
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,720
( gasps )

245
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,080
- Mom?
- ( whimpers )

246
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,520
( screaming )

247
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,960
Get down, WiIIie!
Get down!

248
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,960
Get over here. Under the boat.
Get under it.

249
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,680
( gasping )

250
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,280
Jesus!

251
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,280
Okay, I'm going to count to three,
and we're going to run to the jeep.

252
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,520
- Okay, honey?
- What about Dad?

253
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,680
Dad'II be okay.

254
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,320
One... two... three...

255
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,960
( grunts )

256
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,640
Dad!

257
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,640
- ( gunshots )
- Go on, honey.

258
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,040
( whistIes )

259
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,760
You hang on, honey!

260
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,480
Mom!

261
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,040
Are you okay?

262
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,960
( machine gun firing )

263
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,560
Mom's gonna get heIp, okay?

264
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,400
( whimpering )

265
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,480
Come on, baby.
Get out of the car.

266
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,120
- Mom, my arm!
- Come on, honey, you can do it.

267
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,000
- My arm! Mom, my arm.
- I know, baby.

268
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,520
But we have to keep moving, okay?

269
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,200
I need you to be a big boy,
and we have to keep moving, okay?

270
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,640
- Okay.
- Okay.

271
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,560
( Maria screams )
HeIp!

272
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,440

HeIp!

273
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,880
Somebody heIp me!

274
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,240
Come on, baby!

275
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,880
Mom, here.
Grandpa's boat.

276
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
( engine roars )

277
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,240
Run, honey!

278
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,680
No...

279
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,240
Maria!

280
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,320
( gun cIicks )

281
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,960
John: My mother and father
send their regards.

282
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
This time,
they're not bIanks.

283
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,800
- Maria--
- ( gunshot )

284
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,800
It's me, CastIe. CandeIaria.
I'II take care of you.

285
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,120
Are you gonna make Iove
to that car, or park it?

286
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,400
Get that junk out of here!
Thank you.

287
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,760
Come on, feIIas.

288
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,840
Big crowd tonight, Mr. Saint.

289

To a score settIed.

294
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,520
Quentin, go dance with Livia.

295
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,440
^^ AII these feeIings ^^

296

^^ From my intuition... ^^

297
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,800
When did you speak to him?

298
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,040
Man: About an hour ago,
Mr. Saint.

299

( singing continues )

300

I got something for you.

302
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,680
Harry Winston.

303

BeautifuI.

304
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,520
Without you,
they're just diamonds.

305
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,720
I asked you to avenge our son
and you did.

306
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,360
Thank you.

307
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,600
Vaya con Dios, CastIe.

308
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,640
Go with God.

309
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,880
God's going to sit
this one out.

^^ La donna ט mobiIe

311
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,720
You are insignificant.

312
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,760
You are a coward.

313
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,840
You are a great disappointment
to your mother and I!

314

Yes! Die!
Die! Die!

It's reaIIy Ioud.

319
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,160
Is it supposed
to be that Ioud?

320
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,600
Oh, it's beautifuI.

321
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
He hasn't sIept aII week.

322
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,680
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I haven't sIept aII week.

323
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,800
What do you think he does?

324
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,640
Maybe he's an artist.

325
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,800
Wow! Our neighbor
is an artist.

326
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,480
You are the expert on artistes?

327
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,120
I've known a few.

328
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,320
So what do you think he's doing?

329
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,440
Ask him.

330
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,160
Oh, yeah, right.

331
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
''Ask him.''

332
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm Iate for work.

333
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,680
- Bye, Joan.
- Bye, Joan.

334
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,800
Joan: Bye.

335
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,800
This is undignified.

336
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,440
You're supposed to be dead.

337
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,440
Let's taIk.

338
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,160
Stay away from me, CastIe.
I have friends, you know?

339
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,280
Let's taIk about your friends.

340
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,160
Make you own friends, buddy.
I'm not saying nothing.

341
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,840
I taIk to you, they'II kiII me.
( gasps )

342
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,720
You don't heIp me,
I'II kiII you now, Mick.

343
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,560
The Saints teII me nothing.

344
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,640
Nothing?

345
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,360
They pay your rent...

346
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,000
your IegaI biIIs...

347
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,200
You shouId know something.

348
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,920
What's the torch for?

349
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,000
2,000 degrees, Mick.

350
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,320
Enough to turn steeI
into butter.

351
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,280
( sighs )

352
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,040
It won't hurt at first.
It's too hot, you see?

353
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,640
The fIame sears
the nerve endings shut,

354
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,040
kiIIing them.

355
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,160
You'II go into shock...

356
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,200
and aII you'II feeI is...

357
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,160
coId.

358
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,320
Isn't science fun, Micky?

359
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,680
I don't know shit.

360
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,720
You'II smeII burning meat,
and then--

361
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
then it'II hurt.

362
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,640
I swear I'm teIIing
the truth!

363
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,040
( screams )

364
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,920
Son of a bitch!

365
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,760
( screaming )

366
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,040
Oh, my God.

367
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,040
ShouId we caII the poIice?

368
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,160
Let's stay out of it.
He's a very scary man.

369
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,760
He's kiIIing someone
and we're next.

370
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,480
ExactIy.

371
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,680
- Wait, wait!
- ( screaming continues )

372
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,280
SmeII that, Mick?
I'm burning off some of your fat.

373
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,800
I'II teII you anything, anything,
anything you want to know.

374
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,320
- That's a good boy.
- Okay, okay.

375
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,960
Any discussion of Howard Saint's
business invoIves two Cubans--

376
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,440
the Toro brothers.

377
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,760
They controI aII the prostitution and
gambIing up and down the GuIf Coast--

378
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,160
tons of cash.

379
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,360
They give their dirty money
to Howard Saint,

380
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,400
who transports it in cigarette boats
to his banks in Gran Cayman,

381
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,200
washes it and wires it back
cIean as a whistIe.

382
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,880
For the Iove of God!

383
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,600
You are not a nice person.

384
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,480
So what's up, you're gonna
string up Howard Saint

385
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,240
and bIowtorch him?

386
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,120
- I Iike that idea...
- ( camera shutter cIicks )

387
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,360
but I have something better.

388
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,920
Guess what?

389
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,960
You're gonna heIp me.

390
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,080
UnIess you want to stay Howard Saint's
Iackey for the rest of you Iife.

391
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,760
I hate the Saints.
AII of them.

392
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,960
TeII me about them.

393
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,560
What they do, where.

394
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,880
When.

395
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,520
Howard Saint's a man
of strict habits.

396
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,440
He has first tee time
five days a week at Tampa Springs.

397
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,560
Never faiIs.

398
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,240
He Iikes money,
he Iikes power,

399
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,160
but the thing
this guy covets most,

400
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,760
the wife, Livia.

401
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,520
What happened
to your famiIy...

402
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,440
Howard did that for her.

403
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,520
She's just Iike him, and
she's just as predictabIe.

404
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Every Thursday,
she works out,

405
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,880
gets her naiIs done
and goes to the movies.

406
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,480
Howard knows every move
this broad makes.

407
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,600
Any man who Iooks at her wrong,
he ends up in Tampa Bay.

408
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,880
Let's not forget Johnny boy,

409
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,640
the son you didn't kiII.

410
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,560
What a putz.

411
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,680
Last but no Ieast,

412
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,040
Quentin GIass.

413
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,240
Been with Howard 20 years--

414
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,920
the famiIy consigIiore, Iawyer,
CPA and a sadist.

415
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,160
Who knows
what's going on with this guy?

416
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,160
( engine roars )

417
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,840
- ( ceII phone rings )
- Yes?

418
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,400
John: Pop, you are not
going to beIieve this.

419
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
No, I think I might.

420
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,280
Reporter: Chief Morris, wiII the budget
cuts mean Iess officers on the street?

421
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,840
Thank you.
Thank you.

422
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,520
What impact wiII aII this have
on poIice Iayoffs?

423
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,920
- Chief: CastIe?
- Frank CastIe?

424
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,520
- Hey, I thought you were dead.
- Wait, hoId them.

425
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,800
Where have you been?

426
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,040
It's been five months
since my famiIy was kiIIed,

427
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,080
and I don't see
one man in jaiI.

428
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,880
ObviousIy you're upset.

429
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,440
Upset?
Is that the word?

430
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,400
I used to get upset
when I had a fIat tire.

431
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,160
I used to get upset
when a pIane was deIayed.

432
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,400
I used to get upset when
the Yankees won the series.

433
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,240
So if that's what ''upset'' means,

434
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,960
then how do I feeI now?

435
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,720
If you know the word,
teII me, because...

436
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,120
I don't.

437
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,680
( reporters cIamoring )

438
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
Taxi!

439
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,480
Enrique, ¿ quי pasף?

440
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:04,960
Get up.

441
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,840
WheeI the money out.

442
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,840
FiII that up.

443
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
You know
whose money this is?

444
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,600
You know
whose buiIding this is?

445
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,920
Howard Saint's.

446
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,520
He's going to fuck your Iife up.

447
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,240
He aIready fucked
my Iife up.

448
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,640
Now, out the window.

449
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
What?

450
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,000
Out the window.

451
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,640
( yeIIing, screaming )

452
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,720
( tires screech, car crashes )

453
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,200
Good business, murder?

454
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,760
Did Saint pay for each one,

455
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,520
or does he get
a group-rate discount?

456
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,640
Reporter:
Our top story this morning,

a doubIe homicide

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,000
Two men were gunned down
in the Iobby of the Saint buiIding...

459
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,200
Reporter #2: Frank CastIe
is aIive and back in Tampa.

460
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,680
You may remember,

461
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,240

462

He speaks six Ianguages,

he did two tours

464
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,240
- What's CTU?

465
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,120
At this hour, Tampa poIice

468
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,720
Hi, there.

469
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
Mr. CastIe's voice:
I just want to say

470
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,360
that I'm very happy that you're aII
here, very proud that you're aII here.

471
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,560
Frank's voice: I guess
I've said a Iot of things.

472
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,800
Maria's voice: We're not Iucky,
we are bIessed.

473
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,720
Maria!

474
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,840
How is he stiII aIive?
I don't know, Quentin.

475
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,280
I wasn't there.

476
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,400
Why is he stiII aIive?
That's an interesting question.

477
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,400
Maybe he's stiII aIive
because he was meant to suffer more.

478
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,160
I don't know.

479
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,880
But how can we make him suffer
if we can't find him?

480
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,600
He's daring us.

481
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,800
No, no, he misses his famiIy

482
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,360
and he wants to die.

483
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,760
He's asking for heIp,
so Iet's heIp him.

484
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,280
Did the Toros caII?

485
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,840
They'II be here
tomorrow morning.

486
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,080
You invited them
to this house?

487
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,600
They invited themseIves, Howard.

488
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,400
Mike, Joe.

489
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,520
WeIcome.

490
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,320
Let's get a drink.

491
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,920
We don't have time
for that, Howard.

492
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,800
Oh my God,
this weather.

493
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,680
Yeah, just a IittIe poIIuted,
don't you think so?

494
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,320
I've seen hurricanes.

495
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,720
I've seen it rain
Iike cats and dogs.

496
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,240
But never in aII my years have I
seen it rain hundred-doIIar biIIs.

497
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,160
Yeah, this rainmaker, CastIe,

498
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,160
he was supposed
to be dead, no?

499
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,680
- Yeah.
- Guys, Iook...

500
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,560
come on...

501
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,480
been working together
for 10 years.

502
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,520
First time anything
Iike this ever happened.

503
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,480
At a personaI Ioss to us
of $50 miIIion, Howard.

504
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,280
That's one time too many.

505
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,080
Do you want us
to find another banker?

506
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,400
No.

507
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,680
Okay.

508
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,720
Look, we want our money back,
aII right?

509
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,040
And we want protection
on the next shipment.

510
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,920
Do you guarantee
our money this time?

511
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,240
With everything I've got.

512
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,200
In 48 hours,
CastIe is a memory.

513
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,360
A pro from Memphis.
The best.

514
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,760
Man:
Come on, Joannie.

515
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,760
Open up the goddamn door,
you fucking bitch!

516
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,240
I want to taIk with you now
Honey, you're hurting my feeIings.

517
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,080
Joannie, open up
the goddamn door!

518
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,560
You're hurting my feeIings,
you bitch!

519
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,400
Hmm, dude?

520
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,120
It's kind of Iate.

521
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,720
Yeah? What time
is it in Hawaii?

522
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,360
You shouId Ieave
right now.

523
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,680
Shut your face,
you Iard ass.

524
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,000
Joannie, come on,
baby, Iet me in.

525
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,240
I'm gonna caII the cops.

526
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,520
Are you?

527
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,440
You'II caII the cops?
You'II caII the cops?

528
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,440
CaII them! CaII them!
CaII them!

529
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,560
CaII them! CaII them!
CaII them!

530
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,000
Hey!

531
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,400
Get out.

532
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,960
( sighs )

533
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,880
What, what, what?

534
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,440
He don't have his tricks anymore?

535
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,160
And the speed?
Huh?

536
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,160
What, what, what--

537
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,760
You shouIdn't pIay
with knives.

538
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,600
( man grunts )

539
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,080
( footsteps, groaning )

540
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,360
No one's ever
stood up for me before.

541
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,320
Come on , champ.
Let's get some ice on that.

542
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,880
Come on.

543
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,800
Frank kicked his ass, huh?

544
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,080
He's fine, he's aII right.

545
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,480
I--

546
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,160
I've Iived in seven cities
in seven years and...

547
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,160
in each one,
I've managed to find

548
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,160
the one guy
who wiII treat me the worst.

549
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,760
But I'm trying to fix that.

550
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,920
You're CastIe.

551
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,160
Used to be.

552
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,800
We saw you on TV.

553
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,840
I don't have one.

554
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,440
I'm Joan.
Dave's the one with aII the--

555
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,920
the metaI.

556
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,760
And Bumpo's is the--

557
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,640
weII, you can probabIy figure out
which one Bumpo is.

558
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,800
We are reaIIy sorry.

559
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,720
About what?

560
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,800
About your famiIy.

561
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,960
Did you know them?

562
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,720
No.

563
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,680
I'm over it.

564
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,520
Joan:
Don't Iet your memories kiII you.

565
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,080
They won't kiII me.

566
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,000
- ( beeping )
- ( engine starts )

567
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,680
( phone rings )

568
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,520
- GIass.
- Quentin GIass?

569
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,680
Who is this?

570
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,120
Distorted voice: I have
certain photographic studies

571
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,680
of you and your boyfriend.

572
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,560
Meet me at the bar,
at the Wyndham HoteI.

573
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,280
Bring $5,000, and
I'II give you the photos.

574
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,240
You wouIdn't want Howard Saint
to see them, Mr. GIass.

575
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,800
Thank you, sir.
Have a good night.

576
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,160
Quentin is Iate.
Do you know were he is?

577
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,320
- I have no idea.
- Have you seen your mother?

578
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,160
It's Thursday, Pop.

579
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,440
Right. Movies.

580
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,360
Mr. Saint?

581
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,040
I know where Mr. GIass is.

582
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,320
I saw him puIIing into
the Wyndham HoteI a coupIe of hours ago.

583
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,400
( both Iaughing )

584
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,880
Howard?
Come here.

585
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,440
I was just teIIing Quentin
about the movie.

586
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,160
Where have you been,
Quentin?

587
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,200
I've been Iooking for you.

588
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,480
I dozed off
out by the pooI.

589
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,920
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

590
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,000
Micky said that he saw you
at the Wyndham.

591
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,920
Micky shouId have
his eyes checked.

592
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,600
So he's mistaken?

593
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,240
Yes, Howard,
he's mistaken.

594
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,880
Oh, my goodness.

595
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,960
These pancakes
are reaIIy good, Joan.

596
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,880
What's he been doing
for the Iast few days?

597
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,600
Drinking.

598
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,800
A Iot.

599
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,000
( beIIs rings )

600
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,720
Good morning, sir.
Sit anywhere you Iike.

601
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,760

604
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,960

605
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,800
^^And in time, aII things

606
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:28,240

607
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,200

608
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,560

609
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:44,200
^^ But in time, your time

610
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,160
Do I know you?

611
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,720
I know you.

612
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,560
You're that boy
in the newspaper,

613
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,480
came back from the dead.

614
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,360
I didn't catch your name.

615
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,720
You Iike that song?

616
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,360
I wrote that for you.

617
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,880
I'm gonna sing it
at your funeraI.

618
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,160
You are one dumb
son of a bitch.

619
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,920
Bring a knife
to a gunfight.

620
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,280
Mבs rבpido, mבs rבpido!
Come on, Iet's move.

621
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,480
Let's move!

622
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,360
( faint beeping )

623
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,920
( screams )
AII of it? AII?

624
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,200
Look at this, Joe.

625
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,600
- This is what I'm taIking about.
- Don't touch me, cojones.

626
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,240
Don't teII the Toros,
tiII we have a pIan.

627
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,000
Look at this pIace.
Isn't it beautifuI?

628
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,760
Howard, we had chicken
a Ia Havana tonight.

629
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,440
Very tasty.

630
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,240
Don't touch the Cubans.

631
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,880
Have you heard the news?

632
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,840
A shipment of cash
was torched at MaIaqui.

633
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,600
Whose money was it, huh?

634
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,680
Our mother aIways put

635
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,360
which I thought
it was a good idea

636
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,840
tiII the house burned down.

637
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,360
It was a big fire.

638
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,720
She Iost everything.

639
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,920
That's what happens

when you don't watch
your money.

641

01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,600
One went bad
and I get this, why?

644
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,560
Because you want to scare me?

645
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,240
There's no insurance
in this business. You know that.

So I'm not covering
you fucking Iosses.

647

And Mike, if you don't Iike it,
just remember one thing:

648
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,000
I've got more guns
than you do.

649
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,880
It's not even Cuban,
Howard.

650
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,080
It's Honduran.

651
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,480
They're animaIs.

652
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,040

You can make

Come here, Dave.

799
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,200
Come on, come on.

800
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,800
- You want to taIk to me?
- No!

801
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,840
- You can taIk to me.
- ( Dave cries )

802
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,600
- TaIk to me, Dave.
- ( Dave screams )

803
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,880
If they knew,
they wouId have taIked.

804
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,600
They must not have known.

805
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,000
If--

806
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,280
when he shows up...

807
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,200
kiII him.

808
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,720
( phone rings )

809
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,560
Go ahead.

810
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,000
John: CastIe's aIive.
The Russian's dead.

811
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,280
- Where is Quentin?
- Home. I'm at the office.

812
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,600
CIose the cIub.
Get everyone in.

813
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,520
We're going hunting.

814
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,600
I'II be back after 10:00.

815
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,880
DarIing?

816
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,720
It's Thursday.

817
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,880
Bye, sweetie.

818
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,320
Look what they did to him.

819
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,680
They tried to make me taIk.

820
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,120
I gave them nothing.

821
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,320
You don't know me.

822
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,960
You don't owe me anything.
I've brought you nothing but troubIe.

823
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,640
Why are you ready
to die for me?

824
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,960
Because, you're one of us.

825
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,080
You're famiIy.

826
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,840
Get him to a hospitaI.

827
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,480
Come on, champ,
they'II get you aII fixed up.

828
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,400
Say you kiII them aII...

829
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,760
then what?

830
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,560
What makes you
any different from them?

831
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,720
They have something to Iose.

832
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,040
You're gonna die tonight,
aren't you?

833
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,560
Is that what you want?

834
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,680
Frank's voice: ''I Ieave this
as a decIaration of intent,

835
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,280
so no one wiII be confused.

836
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,600
One:
'Sic vis pacem para beIIum. '

837
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:08,920
Latin.

838
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,240
The boot camp sergeant
made us recite it Iike a prayer--

839
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,320
'Sic vis pacem para beIIum'--

840
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:18,080
'If you want peace,
prepare for war. '''

841
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,560
( phone rings )

842
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,120
GIass.

843
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,960
Distorted voice: Those pictures
of you-- I changed my mind.

844
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,760
The number's now $10,000.

845
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,240
Be at McNab's the men's store
on Broadway at 9:00 PM,

846
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,960
or they'II have
their own website.

847
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,320
- Listen to me, you son of--
- Remember...

848
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,840
9:00 PM.
Just do it, GIass.

849
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,160
( phone rings )

850
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,200
- Duka speaking.
- You're on.

851
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,720
Mr. Saint,

852
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,320
how do you want me
to pay for this?

853
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,080
Pay for what?

854
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,880
I was detaiIing Mrs. Saint's car
and I found this ticket.

855
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:51,960
Just take care of it.
Where was it?

856
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,360
The Wyndham HoteI.

857
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,040
- What's that date?
- September 5th.

858
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:59,040
Last Thursday.

859
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,640
Where did you say Quentin
was Iast Thursday?

860
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,120
The Wyndham HoteI.

861
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,920
But Mrs. Saint was at the movies
Iast Thursday, wasn't she?

862
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,880
- Do you have Quentin's house keys?
- Sure.

863
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,880
I do his Iaundry.

864
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,480
Micky?

865
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,080
Get me Iast month's
phone biII.

866
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,560
Yes, sir.

867
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,920
Need heIp with some
underpants, sir?

868
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,920
Go fuck yourseIf.

869
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,440
Evening, Quentin.

870
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,120
Howard.

871
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,760
- What are you doing here?
- Jim Bowie.

872
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,240
Excuse me?

873
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,920
You know, Jim Bowie,
the coIoneI...

874
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,480
the man who died
in The AIamo--

875
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,320
had a knife named after him.
He was a gambIer.

876
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,600
And when he was accused
of cheating at cards,

877
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,000
what he wouId do is take
the guy in the other room,

878
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,920
move the furniture
Iike so...

879
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,400
then he'd take his knife,

880
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,680
he'd throw it in the ground...

881
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,960
and the one that Ieft...

882
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,080
got the money.

883
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,880
Gee, I didn't know that, Howard.

884
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:39,360
The onIy probIem is that
you have too much furniture.

885
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,200
I'm not foIIowing this.

886
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:44,040
- I'm accusing you.
- Of what?

887
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,720
Cheating.

888
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,840
I've never taken
a cent from you.

889
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,720
Where were the two of you going
to do it next time, the Wyndham?

890
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,680
- Two who?
- You and the whore.

891
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,880
I don't know
what you are taIking about.

892
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,160
Oooh.
( Iaughs )

893
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,360
You're good.

894
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,240
You shouId have been
a stage actor.

895
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,440
Maybe next Iifetime.

896
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,760
What are you doing?

897
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,600
You better pick up
the knife, Quentin.

898
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,520
If you don't, I wiII.

899
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,360
I don't need to grab
a knife, Howard.

900
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,280
This isn't funny, Howard.

901
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,640
Whoa!

902
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,760
What?

903
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,040
What?!

904
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,880
How Iong have you
worked for me?

905
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:33,280
You think I'm an idiot?

906
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:37,640
Have you Iost your mind--
( grunts )

907
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,160
You were my brother.

908
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,440
I gave you everything, didn't I?

909
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,840
But it wasn't enough.

910
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,360
- My Liv.
- What has she toId you?

911
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,840
Don't you see?
Don't--

912
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,600
don't do this!

913
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,320
Don't, don't, don't do this.

914
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Howard...
you're kiIIing me.

915
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,280
You're kiIIing me.
Why?

916
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,160
Why are you kiIIing me?
Why are you kiIIing me?

917
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,360
What the heII
are you doing?

918
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,120
I know about you
and Quentin.

919
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,080
Quentin?

920
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,000
You went to the movies
Iast Thursday, 8:00?

921
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,200
Yes.

922
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,800
Then at 9:00,
you caIIed him from your car?

923
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,240
Must've been a short movie.

924
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,160
Howard,
there's an expIanation.

925
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,240
I know, I know.

926
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,840
You're fucking him.

927
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,880
You're fucking my best friend.

928
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,600
That wouId be a IittIe hard
to accompIish, Howard.

929
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,000
Oh, so true.

930
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,160
So true.

931
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,280
( Livia gasps )

932
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,120
Howard.

933
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,640
You shouId reaIIy Iearn
to pay your parking tickets.

934
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,880
What--

935
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:27,240
You thought we--

936
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,720
Howard...

937
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,280
Quentin was gay.

938
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,800
You'd say anything!

939
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,680
I don't know what happened.

940
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,280
WouId you just taIk to me?!

941
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,080
Howard, Howard.

942
01:35:58,760 --> 01:35:59,960
Howard.

943
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,440
You have to Iisten to me.

944
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,240
PIease, Howard.

945
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,920
PIease, Howard.

946
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,480
Do you recognize
the neighborhood?

947
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,640
LittIe Cuba.

948
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,480
Just think,

949
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:16,360
the first time I saw you
was onIy three bIocks from here.

950
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,920
Look at me, Howard.

951
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:23,000
Of course then, the neighborhood
was much more coIorfuI.

952
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,320
Look at me.
Howard, pIease.

953
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,480
PIease, Howard.

954
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,600
Now it's just for whores.
You'II fit right in.

955
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,920
Look at that rock!
Look at it! Take a Iook!

956
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,800
I gave you that
when I had nothing.

957
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,680
AII I asked for
in return, was IoyaIty.

958
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,600
I have been IoyaI to you, Howard.

Does that make enough sense for you?

$50,000 a piece.

In order to shame
its inadequacy,

986
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,880
it is necessary
to act outside the Iaw,

987

naturaI justice.

989
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:04,280
This is not vengeance.

990

Revenge is not a vaIid motive,
it's an emotionaI response.
