2
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,081
Morning.

3
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:51,191
What did the doctor say yesterday?

4
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,623
My blood pressure is a bit high.

5
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:54,998
That's all.

6
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,498
High blood pressure?

7
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:58,623
That's bad.

2016 HONG KONG BALLET COMPETITION

9
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:01,081
You might not carry to term.

10
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,373
You had better stay home.

11
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:06,581
I can't.

12
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:07,873
Why not?

13
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,498
Go back to work after the baby is born.

14
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:14,623
Good boy.

15
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,456
Honey.

16
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:19,248
Be careful.

17
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:21,248
You, be careful.

18
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:24,165
- You, be careful.
- You, be careful.

19
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:25,248
- You.
- You.

20
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,206
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.

21
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,748
Why are you all standing around?

22
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:40,915
Back to work!

23
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,831
Boy, snap out of it.

24
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:45,355
Something big is going down tonight.

25
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:46,873
Look alive.

26
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Here.

27
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,665
What's this?

28
00:04:51,748 --> 00:04:53,831
What else? It's for you.

29
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:57,165
Miscellaneous baby stuff from my children.

30
00:04:57,248 --> 00:05:00,373
My wife told me to give it to your wife.

31
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:01,581
Thank you.

32
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,165
But I'm having a son.

33
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:04,831
I don't need the girl stuff.

34
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:07,290
Then have a daughter next.

35
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,790
I'm not taking it back.

36
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,123
- My wife will kill me.
- Okay.

37
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:12,331
Thank you.

38
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,248
Don't thank me yet.

39
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:15,581
You received another complaint.

40
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,290
What now?

41
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:20,081
Did you arrest Tall Ming
in Causeway Bay last week?

42
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:21,290
Yes.

43
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,123
Did you notify the division commander?

44
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,456
If I waited for his order,
it would have been too late.

45
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,081
Same excuse again.

46
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:28,456
You solved the case.

47
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,665
But Officer Kwan lost face.

48
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,915
You're good, but you're not a team player.

49
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:36,748
For once, try to get along with others.

50
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,456
So what happened? Did you settle it?

51
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,956
I took him out to dinner and fixed it.

52
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,290
- Great.
- Pay me back for the dinner.

53
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:45,498
I owe you. Let's go.

54
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:49,831
I am the field commander
of this joint operation.

55
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,081
Here is tonight's operation order.

56
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:55,540
Wong Kwun. We have tracked him for years.

57
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,373
Murder, arson, blackmail,

58
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,290
drugs, you name it.

59
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,540
CIB has a lead that at 9 p.m. tonight

60
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:03,623
Long Hair from the Vietnamese Gang

61
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:05,831
will do a major drug deal with Wong Kwun.

62
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:08,831
We will take them down
no matter how strong they are!

63
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,998
Our final briefing
will be at 8 p.m. tonight.

64
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,748
This operation is confidential.

65
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,415
The location will be released
before the operation starts.

66
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:19,206
We will arrest all those scumbags tonight!

67
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,373
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:21,290
Dismissed.

69
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:22,373
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

70
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,248
- Yes, Beau?
- Bong.

71
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:29,040
I need your help.

72
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,498
Without you,
tonight's operation might get canceled.

73
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,040
- All right.
- Hurry.

74
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:34,540
I can't handle it. Okay?

75
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:35,831
I'm on my way.

76
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,873
Where the hell is he?

77
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:45,165
Beau!

78
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:46,248
You're late.

79
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,690
- The brass is waiting.
- Why will the operation be canceled?

80
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:53,373
You're lying again.

81
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,165
If I didn't say that, would you have come?

82
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,415
The brass is waiting for you.

83
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:58,331
It's urgent. Help me, okay?

84
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:00,599
Refuse this and I will be dead.

85
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:02,290
My future will be ruined, okay?

86
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:04,206
Considering I'm your boss,

87
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,248
classmate, and good buddy,

88
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:07,331
please help.

89
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:09,290
I'm not your buddy.

90
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:11,831
Sorry! The busy man has finally arrived.

91
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:13,290
Officer Cheung!

92
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:14,498
How are you, Officer Chow?

93
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,331
Not as fit as you.

94
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,290
Please sit. I will introduce everyone.

95
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:23,165
Officer Tai, our division commander.

96
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:24,748
You know Officer Lee.

97
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:26,040
This is Officer Ho.

98
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:28,873
- Senior Superintendent of CAPO.
- Hello, Officer Ho.

99
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,331
- Mr. Youli Chan.
- Hello.

100
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,956
And his son.

101
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Mr. Chan has been our longtime supporter

102
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:37,873
and has asked to meet with you today.

103
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:38,956
Do you remember

104
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,748
the Hang Choi Bank robbery
in Tai Kok Tsui in 2013?

105
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:43,748
Officer Cheung cracked the case.

106
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,748
And, of course, in 2016,

107
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,206
the gunfight at Sai Kung Pier.

108
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,206
Officer Cheung singlehandedly captured

109
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,290
seven international criminals
with just two rounds.

110
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:55,081
- Gosh!
- They were former soldiers.

111
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:57,123
- Amazing.
- Amazing.

112
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,998
To Officer Cheung,
who has solved many cases over the years!

113
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,456
- Cheers, Officer Cheung.
- Cheers, Officer Cheung.

114
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:07,415
Gentlemen,

115
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:10,623
you asked me here today.

116
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,206
What can I do for you?

117
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:17,873
Officer Cheung, we know you are good,

118
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,873
but you just need

119
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,123
an opportunity.

120
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:24,290
Hello, Officer Cheung.

121
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:26,623
I am Mr. Chan's lawyer.

122
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,040
A few nights ago,

123
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:31,498
Mr. Chan Jr. had too much to drink

124
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:33,206
and accidentally injured this policeman.

125
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:37,373
He has forgiven Mr. Chan Jr.

126
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:39,706
- Therefore...
- I get it.

127
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,165
But I have already
turned in the report, so...

128
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,123
It's back on your desk.

129
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:47,373
Give it back to me next week.

130
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:49,748
That's right.

131
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:52,831
As you can see,

132
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,623
the victim is enjoying his lunch.

133
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:58,248
So even if it gets to court,
it may not hold water.

134
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,456
Beau, don't fuck around.

135
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,748
Don't you know me by now?

136
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:03,581
I want to help you
get promoted, that's all.

137
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:04,790
You set me up!

138
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:07,415
How? I'm not asking you to sell your ass.

139
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:08,915
This is worse.

140
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:15,248
Whether you agree or not,
the result will be the same.

141
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,040
The brass wants to impress the rich guy.

142
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,706
Just play along.

143
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:24,040
You're not young anymore
and will soon be a dad.

144
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:26,248
Please, I beg you.

145
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:27,623
I love you.

146
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:38,040
Sorry.

147
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,790
Officer Cheung, are you okay?

148
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,873
He's fine. He just drank too much water.

149
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:46,623
Have you made it clear?

150
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:48,540
Crystal clear.

151
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:05,081
This is good tea.

152
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:06,165
Waiter.

153
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,665
Is it expensive?

154
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:11,998
It's the best Iron Buddha Tea.

155
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:14,331
- It's 600,000 dollars per catty.
- 600,000 dollars?

156
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:16,956
It's good stuff.

157
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:23,998
I took two sips.

158
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,706
200 dollars should cover it.

159
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:28,040
Excuse me. I must go.

160
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:29,206
Officer Cheung.

161
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:32,373
Do you know what you're doing?

162
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:34,290
Of course I do. Do you?

163
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,373
Bong!

164
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:39,998
I'm warning you now.

165
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,040
Listen up.

166
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:46,331
If anybody screws up,

167
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:51,206
they will have hell to pay.

168
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:08,290
Chow.

169
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:11,248
Why are you taking so long
over some Kevlar vests?

170
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,248
What's wrong?

171
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:17,206
I don't have your UI.

172
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,165
What?

173
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,290
Any questions?

174
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:23,456
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

175
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
Let's go!

176
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,540
Sorry, Bong.

177
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:32,748
I'm just following the procedure.

178
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,331
Your UI is not showing.

179
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,290
You're not a part of this operation.

180
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,165
Yes?

181
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:48,456
Location?

182
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:50,873
Location?

183
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:52,415
I can't tell you.

184
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:55,040
Are you fucking with me too?

185
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:57,290
Not me. I'm just following orders.

186
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:59,373
I told you to be a team player.

187
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:02,081
- Don't upset the higher-ups.
- They're boot-lickers!

188
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:04,373
CAPO and ICAC are investigating them.

189
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:07,123
But that takes time, right?

190
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:10,623
Yiu, you know I have waited four years!

191
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,790
I must capture
the bastard Wong Kwun tonight.

192
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:14,206
I know.

193
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,498
You just can't let it go. Neither can I.

194
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:17,665
Stay put.

195
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:20,123
They're looking to get rid of you.

196
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:22,206
I don't want you to lose your job.

197
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,373
Trust me. Wong Kwun is an easy job.

198
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:27,165
I will personally bring him back.

199
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:30,665
- You can take his statement, okay?
- Quit the bullshit! Location!

200
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:32,081
- Location!
- Goodbye.

201
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:36,665
Call your friend in CIB.

202
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,415
- I will get the car.
- Now!

203
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,748
OB calling Control Post.

204
00:13:48,831 --> 00:13:50,706
I estimate over 20 lookouts onsite.

205
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,670
We believe the target will make the deal
at the third-floor skating rink.

206
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,373
Attention, all units.

207
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:00,081
The target is at the skating rink.

208
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:02,206
A-Team, surround the skating rink.

209
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,748
Back Stop, guard all entrances and exits.

210
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:23,081
Got it! Seaview Plaza, Tsuen Wan.

211
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,206
Officer Yiu, the Vietnamese Gang is here.

212
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,290
Take action?

213
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:31,706
Calm down. Wait until the goods
and money change hands.

214
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,331
All units, in position.

215
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:37,956
When the Vietnamese Gang arrives,
we will get them all at once.

216
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,956
What's wrong?
The monitors have gone blank!

217
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,956
Officer Yiu?

218
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,831
- Sir, we have interference.
- We're on it.

219
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:34,790
Hello, Vietnamese boys.

220
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:39,540
Are those party masks?

221
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,998
What the fuck?

222
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:47,373
That's some awesome shit, man!

223
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:55,873
Okay, straight to business.

224
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,706
Transfer the funds.

225
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,081
Fuck!

226
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:17,456
Are there cops outside?

227
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,901
Boss, there really are cops here.

228
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:24,665
Bastard, you dare mess with me?

229
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:43,331
Open fire at the scene!
Requesting urgent backup!

230
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:46,081
Officer Yiu, please respond! Officer Yiu!

231
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:55,873
All units, can you hear me?

232
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:57,331
Can you hear me?

233
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,956
What the fuck?

234
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:06,831
Yes!

235
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:19,956
Hang in there!

236
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:55,790
You bastards.

237
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:20,373
Hello, sir.

238
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:49,331
You bastards.

239
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:54,290
You look ridiculous.

240
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:56,706
Who are you?

241
00:19:57,706 --> 00:19:58,998
Show your faces.

242
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,748
Let me see.

243
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:03,665
I dare you.

244
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:05,206
Go one-on-one with me.

245
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,790
Mano a mano!

246
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,665
It has been a long time.

247
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:44,331
Over there!

248
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,331
We're at Seaview Plaza.

249
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,456
Over 20 injured. Get ambulances here.

250
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,206
What's wrong with you?

251
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,998
I said rob, not kill.

252
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:16,956
You killed so many cops.

253
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:19,873
Relax, anger is bad for you.

254
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,290
Here. Where's our pay?

255
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:30,831
The cops are too close.

256
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,540
Take your time selling the goods.

257
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,623
You're teaching me?

258
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:37,373
Ngo.

259
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:39,831
What's with you?

260
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:43,331
We suffered all those years in jail.

261
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:45,081
Make all the money you can.

262
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,540
But don't go too far.

263
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:51,498
Too late. Don't ask.

264
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:53,123
Hey!

265
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:02,873
Chu, burn that car.

266
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:06,040
Wah, listen for any news.

267
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:08,123
- Keep us far from the cops.
- Got it.

268
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:10,498
Chuen.

269
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:13,915
Keep the guns, ammo, and vests.

270
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:16,998
No one here should know
where you store them.

271
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:19,540
Chiu.

272
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:23,748
The walkie-talkies.

273
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:25,706
None worked! What's wrong with you?

274
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,331
Sorry, Ngo.

275
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,748
After this is over,
I will divide the money that is left.

276
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:45,623
Meanwhile, stay under the radar.

277
00:23:45,706 --> 00:23:48,498
Take care of your daughter.
Go to work as usual.

278
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:50,290
Don't go out unless you must.

279
00:23:56,248 --> 00:24:00,081
- Let's drink to Bill.
- To Bill.

280
00:25:02,206 --> 00:25:05,123
License check! Lights on, music off!

281
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:06,331
ID cards.

282
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:08,878
- I don't have it.
- Do you not have an ID card?

283
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:10,665
Quit bullying me, damned woman!

284
00:25:10,748 --> 00:25:11,915
Damn you!

285
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:13,373
- Come here!
- Sit down!

286
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:14,998
What are you doing?

287
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,290
Where is Wong Kwun's stuff?

288
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,581
- No idea!
- Bong, something has happened.

289
00:25:18,665 --> 00:25:20,415
- You really don't know?
- No!

290
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:24,456
I will pretend you really don't know

291
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,748
and give you another chance.

292
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:28,623
Close this joint or be my informant.

293
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:39,498
Wrap it up.

294
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,206
- What are you doing?
- Out of the way!

295
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:36,998
What are you doing?

296
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:57,540
Attack!

297
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:00,706
Attack!

298
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,373
- Victory!
- Flip the table over.

299
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:08,081
- Bad try!
- Want to play again?

300
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:10,915
- It's just luck.
- Lucky Bong.

301
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:12,623
Yes, sir?

302
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:17,998
Roger.

303
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:21,290
At 3:30 a.m. today,

304
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,915
business mogul S T Fok
was kidnapped at his home.

305
00:27:23,998 --> 00:27:25,040
That is bad news.

306
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:26,623
What's worse is

307
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:28,706
he was with his female secretary.

308
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:31,790
The ransom is one billion dollars.

309
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:34,373
They warned Mrs. Fok
not to call the police.

310
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:38,040
So she called the Secretary of Security.

311
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,581
Could it be the mistress
who wants a billion dollars?

312
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:43,040
It's possible.

313
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:46,206
DCP has been cleared.

314
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,456
The operation is top-secret

315
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,165
for the safety
of the rescue mission and Mr. Fok himself.

316
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:53,956
These two thugs
have committed every crime.

317
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,165
One is called Coke,
the other is Wong Kwun.

318
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:57,581
These are their files.

319
00:27:59,415 --> 00:28:00,415
Listen up.

320
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:03,581
The brass takes
Mr. Fok's kidnapping very seriously,

321
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:05,998
so we must rescue him
as quickly as possible.

322
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:08,623
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:12,123
Ngo and Bong.

324
00:28:15,665 --> 00:28:18,956
Save Mr. Fok by any means necessary.

325
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,623
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:23,540
Goodbye, sir.

327
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:29,290
Shall we bet on his share price dropping?

328
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:40,748
INTERNATIONAL NIGHTCLUB
GOLDEN APPLE NIGHTCLUB

329
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:43,206
SHANGHAI HAIRSTYLE

330
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,456
- Congratulations.
- On what?

331
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,373
Another promotion next month.

332
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:49,956
You got your wish. Stay humble.

333
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,831
Envy me?

334
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:52,748
A little.

335
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,915
Congratulations, Star of Tomorrow.

336
00:28:54,998 --> 00:28:57,748
- It's the same job.
- No, it's not.

337
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:59,998
We might only catch ten thieves now.

338
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:01,206
When I get promoted,

339
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,748
we can catch hundreds and thousands.

340
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:03,873
Then there will be peace.

341
00:29:03,956 --> 00:29:04,998
That would be good.

342
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:06,761
When you get married, there will be peace.

343
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:09,123
- Set more tables at your wedding banquet.
- Exactly.

344
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,665
- There are a lot of us.
- Of course.

345
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:13,706
- He won't lose money with so many of us.
- Count me out.

346
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,915
Sir, we have eyes
on Coke going to his car.

347
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,623
Will the groom take him on?

348
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:26,790
I will take him.

349
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:28,331
Wong Kwun is all yours, Bong.

350
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:29,790
Then there will be peace.

351
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,581
- Stay sharp.
- Roger.

352
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,873
We have eyes on Wong Kwun
about to leave in his van.

353
00:30:10,915 --> 00:30:13,540
I wait for you every time.
Next time, it's your turn.

354
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:15,623
How much are we betting on?

355
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:16,915
A mahjong game?

356
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:19,956
Make our move anyway.

357
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:32,915
Where is S T Fok?

358
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,915
Speak!

359
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,415
Where is the hostage? Speak!

360
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,623
I don't know what you are talking about.

361
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:45,665
What hostage? What are you talking about?

362
00:30:45,748 --> 00:30:47,165
Get up!

363
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:50,915
No one is beating you up.

364
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,831
Sir?

365
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:57,123
What is the situation?

366
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,456
He won't say anything. Give me more time.

367
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,790
Your time is up.

368
00:31:00,873 --> 00:31:02,456
I don't care how you do it.

369
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,373
Mr. Fok must be safe
before the stock market opens tomorrow.

370
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,331
This is a private operation.

371
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:09,873
Everything is off the record.

372
00:31:09,956 --> 00:31:11,956
The commissioner will not know about it.

373
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,706
If things go bad,
I will have your back, okay?

374
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:19,165
But if you mess up,

375
00:31:19,248 --> 00:31:21,790
the brass will crush us both.

376
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:22,873
Got it?

377
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:24,623
Yes, sir.

378
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:40,123
What's going on? You're crazy!

379
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:42,206
Where is the hostage? Speak!

380
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,456
Speak!

381
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:51,456
Speak!

382
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:54,915
Bastard!

383
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:05,831
You will hear from my lawyer.

384
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:07,581
I don't know anything.

385
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
What are you doing?

386
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:15,331
- Come here!
- What are you doing?

387
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:19,915
I will count to three.

388
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:21,748
We'll see if you're really that tough.

389
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:24,915
I will make you swallow your own teeth!

390
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:26,706
One!

391
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,790
Two!

392
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:34,706
I will talk!

393
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:42,540
143 Wan Lee Street.

394
00:32:42,623 --> 00:32:43,873
Bill, make the call.

395
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:50,165
143 Wan Lee Street, now!

396
00:32:58,915 --> 00:32:59,956
He's here.

397
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,040
Mr. Fok, don't worry. We are the police.

398
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:15,040
You could have saved yourself a beating.

399
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,790
Do you like being beaten?

400
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,415
Did your mom teach you that?

401
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,748
You asked for it.

402
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:26,915
The bastard is biting me!

403
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:29,040
Let go!

404
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:31,248
Let him go!

405
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:36,331
Let go!

406
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:11,373
Police! License check.

407
00:34:11,456 --> 00:34:12,665
Take out your ID cards.

408
00:34:12,748 --> 00:34:13,915
Stop playing now.

409
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,665
Stop. Show your ID card.

410
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:18,248
Behave.

411
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:19,248
Freeze!

412
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:20,873
- Out of the way!
- Freeze!

413
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:23,790
Open the door! Come out!

414
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:25,415
Stop fooling around! Do you hear me?

415
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,623
Come out!

416
00:34:27,706 --> 00:34:29,581
Shall I blast the door open? Come out!

417
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:30,665
He's hiding something.

418
00:34:31,248 --> 00:34:32,498
Come out!

419
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:41,415
Hi, Bong.

420
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:42,498
Hi, Jaws.

421
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,040
Moe, what have you done?

422
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,373
How bold.

423
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:47,331
You dare to take Wong Kwun's stuff?

424
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:48,623
Where did you get it from?

425
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:51,040
I don't know.

426
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,831
I really don't know.

427
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:56,415
Guai!

428
00:34:56,498 --> 00:34:57,498
It's from Guai.

429
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:03,831
CSU has determined that
the last lot of Wong Kwun's drugs

430
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:06,081
was the same as the stuff
from Au Man-guai,

431
00:35:06,165 --> 00:35:07,790
also known as Guai.

432
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:10,706
A few years ago,
he was jailed for manslaughter.

433
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,956
He was released six months ago

434
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,540
and hid in Cha Kwo Ling

435
00:35:14,623 --> 00:35:16,206
to recruit men.

436
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,540
A lot of fake refugees joined him.

437
00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:20,063
He also groomed many knife fighters.

438
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:22,040
In other words, he's a nutcase.

439
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:24,415
That's a dangerous area.

440
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,206
My friend in DATS told me

441
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,540
a cop went there and was chopped up.

442
00:35:29,623 --> 00:35:32,581
They got a South Asian boy to cop to it.

443
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:33,945
There was nothing DATS could do.

444
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,706
No luck. Boss says we need a warrant.

445
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,373
We won't get it tonight.

446
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:42,581
So? Let's go anyway!

447
00:35:42,665 --> 00:35:45,040
We have neither a permit nor backup.

448
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:46,623
It will be dangerous.

449
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:50,748
So? Let's just go home and sleep, then.

450
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:52,540
We are policemen!

451
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:54,623
There's a criminal,
but we don't catch him?

452
00:35:54,706 --> 00:35:56,081
How is that right?

453
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:57,456
You're not afraid, are you?

454
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,831
No, it's not that.
We must follow the rules.

455
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:02,706
You're telling me about rules?

456
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,415
If you're scared, just say so!

457
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:05,956
Hey.

458
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,373
You're funny.

459
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,415
Sometimes aggressive, sometimes sleepy.

460
00:36:09,498 --> 00:36:10,373
Which side are you on?

461
00:36:10,456 --> 00:36:12,581
I would like to sleep,
but we lost so many colleagues!

462
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:14,182
- I can't sleep!
- I can't sleep either!

463
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,540
- Stop it.
- Okay.

464
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:17,206
Okay.

465
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:19,040
Let's call it a day.

466
00:36:21,873 --> 00:36:22,956
That's it, then.

467
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:26,290
We have been on duty
for over 20 hours straight.

468
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:28,498
Okay?

469
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:31,165
I know you're tired. Go home and rest.

470
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:32,165
Bong.

471
00:36:32,248 --> 00:36:34,290
- We're just letting him go?
- Just go home.

472
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,206
- Listen to Bong. Call it a day.
- Bye!

473
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:53,623
ASIAN, YAU TSIM MONG DISTRICT,
PROCURING, GAMBLING, NARCOTICS

474
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,665
Gather around, everyone.

475
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:13,165
Things have changed.

476
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:14,790
Guai's goods are on the street.

477
00:37:14,873 --> 00:37:16,165
Cheung Sung-bong found them.

478
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:19,165
Cops are everywhere. We could get caught.

479
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:21,165
So what should we do now?

480
00:37:43,331 --> 00:37:45,040
You dare mess with me?

481
00:37:45,123 --> 00:37:46,290
Do you have a death wish?

482
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:47,706
Damn you!

483
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,790
Stop it!

484
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:51,290
Bastard!

485
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:55,540
Stay out of trouble!

486
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,956
Stay out of trouble!

487
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:02,248
Don't call me unless it's urgent!

488
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,915
- What are you doing?
- What is he doing?

489
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:18,206
Who are you?

490
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,623
Who are you? Get down!

491
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:31,123
What? A cop is looking for me?

492
00:38:31,206 --> 00:38:33,040
What the fuck?

493
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:41,831
What do you want? Who are you?

494
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,873
What do you want, sir?

495
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:52,665
There he is!

496
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:53,706
Let him go!

497
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,456
- Out of the way!
- There he is!

498
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:06,498
Go away!

499
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,915
- Sir, I'm not involved!
- Caught red-handed!

500
00:39:13,581 --> 00:39:15,623
- Stop filming!
- This will get you 30 years.

501
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:17,123
Caught you!

502
00:39:17,706 --> 00:39:19,540
Guai, congratulations!

503
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,998
You have been caught red-handed!

504
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,665
Hey!

505
00:39:22,748 --> 00:39:24,040
- Guai.
- Sit down.

506
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:26,290
This damn cop insisted I bring him to you.

507
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:27,748
Sit down.

508
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:30,123
Shut up!

509
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:35,206
Well?

510
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:42,248
Quiet, downstairs.

511
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:44,748
It's just one handgun, not a machine gun.

512
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,665
Well, sir?

513
00:39:49,748 --> 00:39:51,248
How can I help you?

514
00:39:52,165 --> 00:39:55,540
Eight of my colleagues died
in last week's Tsuen Wan case.

515
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:59,081
A dozen are still in the ICU.

516
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:01,998
All for this stuff.

517
00:40:03,415 --> 00:40:06,373
This is Wong Kwun's stuff,
and you have it now.

518
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,165
Explain yourself.

519
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:17,081
What if I said I found it?

520
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,290
Let's be frank, Au Man-guai.

521
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:23,165
You're in it for the money.

522
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:26,373
Tell me who did it,
and you will get a lighter sentence.

523
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:40,623
Here, take it.

524
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:43,915
You don't want it?

525
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:46,748
Give it to your men

526
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:48,665
to cover funeral expenses.

527
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:52,831
Being nice doesn't work with you.

528
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:56,283
You're coming to the station!

529
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:58,581
Don't you dare!

530
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,581
Calm down!

531
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:02,540
Don't try it.

532
00:41:02,623 --> 00:41:05,331
What a mess. Let me clear this up first.

533
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:31,831
Boss, just tell him!

534
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:32,956
No way!

535
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:50,081
You bastard!

536
00:42:01,456 --> 00:42:04,956
Freeze! All of you, drop your weapons!

537
00:42:23,456 --> 00:42:26,373
- Come out!
- Come out!

538
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:29,373
- Come out!
- Come out if you dare!

539
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:34,081
I will kill you when you come out!

540
00:43:10,373 --> 00:43:11,498
Stop!

541
00:43:47,498 --> 00:43:48,998
Go back to the station with me.

542
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:51,248
Save it!

543
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:52,415
Let's go.

544
00:43:53,373 --> 00:43:54,373
Back to the station.

545
00:43:55,248 --> 00:43:56,248
Go to hell!

546
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:16,915
Tell me who did it!

547
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:18,165
No way in hell!

548
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:33,290
Tell me!

549
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,706
After long and detailed planning
by the police,

550
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:56,123
we successfully raided
a drug distribution facility

551
00:45:56,206 --> 00:45:57,915
and found over 48 million dollars' worth

552
00:45:57,998 --> 00:45:59,331
of pure crystal meth.

553
00:45:59,415 --> 00:46:00,415
Our labs show

554
00:46:00,498 --> 00:46:03,290
that it is from the same lot as
the drug-related robbery and murder

555
00:46:03,373 --> 00:46:04,915
from last week.

556
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:08,706
The criminals involved in the case
were all shot dead by police

557
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,998
during our very successful operation.

558
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:13,373
The bastards love to brag.

559
00:46:14,331 --> 00:46:17,415
They take all the credit
while we take all the risks.

560
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:22,123
That's life. What can we do?

561
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,040
Change careers.

562
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,331
What? I was joking.

563
00:46:41,123 --> 00:46:42,415
I'm going home.

564
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:47,040
Are you really going home?

565
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:48,581
Yes.

566
00:46:52,165 --> 00:46:54,498
We will get those bastards.

567
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,665
Damn, a whole tooth.

568
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:19,706
Let me clean you up.

569
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:28,081
You're all beat up.

570
00:48:28,165 --> 00:48:29,873
This is the last time.

571
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:36,248
I'm sorry.

572
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,206
BILL CHEUNG

573
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,373
What did we do?
Please give us another chance.

574
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:10,790
We were loyal and dutiful.

575
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:12,873
We rescued people.

576
00:49:13,498 --> 00:49:15,498
Why won't anyone rescue us?

577
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:18,498
Why?

578
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,331
My wife and kids are waiting for me!

579
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:16,498
Leave.

580
00:50:27,581 --> 00:50:29,956
I told you to leave! Understand?

581
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:33,331
Hey!

582
00:50:33,415 --> 00:50:35,790
Enough! That's enough.

583
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,665
No offense.

584
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,415
None taken.

585
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:54,831
Don't you have bad guys to catch?

586
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,248
I come every year
to pay my respects to Bill.

587
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,165
Just to visit him.

588
00:51:01,165 --> 00:51:03,165
I heard you will be a dad soon.

589
00:51:03,248 --> 00:51:04,248
Congratulations.

590
00:51:05,081 --> 00:51:07,081
Yes, soon.

591
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,498
I will be a dad soon.

592
00:51:10,623 --> 00:51:13,623
And you? Are you still seeing Ching?

593
00:51:14,706 --> 00:51:15,706
No.

594
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:19,373
Not since I got out.

595
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:22,623
I was jailed for years.
We canceled the wedding banquet.

596
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:25,206
I couldn't expect my fiancée to wait.

597
00:51:28,915 --> 00:51:30,331
Over the years,

598
00:51:31,123 --> 00:51:32,415
I often went to see you.

599
00:51:32,498 --> 00:51:34,373
But you didn't want to see me. I get it.

600
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:38,415
I was in jail. What was there to see?

601
00:51:40,456 --> 00:51:41,623
Now you're out.

602
00:51:42,873 --> 00:51:44,081
What are your plans?

603
00:51:47,456 --> 00:51:48,998
Do you know that Wong Kwun is dead?

604
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:53,331
So I heard.

605
00:51:54,706 --> 00:51:56,290
We planned for years.

606
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,540
We were going to take them down
during a drug deal last week.

607
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:04,540
But out of nowhere,

608
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,956
a group who knew
the police's plans ambushed us,

609
00:52:08,873 --> 00:52:11,415
took the goods, and killed many people,

610
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:13,665
including eight of our colleagues.

611
00:52:13,748 --> 00:52:14,790
Yiu was one of them.

612
00:52:16,456 --> 00:52:17,540
How reckless of him.

613
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,498
Yiu was a cop for over 30 years.

614
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,165
He was a good cop and a good man.

615
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:30,581
You know he was my mentor.

616
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:32,790
Yes.

617
00:52:33,665 --> 00:52:35,290
Without him, you wouldn't be a cop.

618
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:36,933
If not for you, I wouldn't have either.

619
00:52:38,748 --> 00:52:41,373
But this society doesn't reward good men.

620
00:52:43,248 --> 00:52:46,040
Bill was a good man. Now, he rests here.

621
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,331
I won't spare those bastards.

622
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:51,540
I will catch them all.

623
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:53,706
Good luck with that.

624
00:53:14,415 --> 00:53:15,998
We got Wong Kwun.

625
00:53:16,081 --> 00:53:17,831
He is lawyered up and not talking.

626
00:53:17,915 --> 00:53:19,595
How are things on your end? Where are you?

627
00:53:19,665 --> 00:53:20,998
Tsing Yi Dockyards.

628
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:29,790
Hey!

629
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,915
Stop!

630
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:33,790
Are you nuts? You guys are cops!

631
00:53:48,665 --> 00:53:50,081
He's dead!

632
00:54:33,831 --> 00:54:35,040
What now?

633
00:54:36,165 --> 00:54:38,665
We were told to rescue Mr. Fok. We did.

634
00:54:38,748 --> 00:54:40,040
Were we wrong?

635
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:41,790
Either the suspect dies

636
00:54:41,873 --> 00:54:43,165
or Mr. Fok does.

637
00:54:43,915 --> 00:54:45,123
Who would you choose?

638
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,331
I'm tired. I'm leaving.

639
00:54:54,373 --> 00:54:55,373
Bong.

640
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:57,290
Bong!

641
00:55:12,998 --> 00:55:15,456
Due to the sensitive nature of this case,

642
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,540
this trial will be conducted
behind closed doors.

643
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:20,956
Mr. S T Fok,

644
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,081
from what you remember,
besides the late Ho Wai-lok,

645
00:55:24,165 --> 00:55:27,165
was the other suspect,
Wong Kwun, involved in the kidnapping?

646
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:29,540
I really am not sure.

647
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:34,665
There was no need
to kill anyone, was there?

648
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,123
What? If not for us, you would be dead!

649
00:55:37,206 --> 00:55:39,331
We saved your life
and you said there was no need?

650
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,165
Please calm down.

651
00:55:41,248 --> 00:55:44,123
Defendants, control your emotions.

652
00:55:46,831 --> 00:55:48,373
Mr. Seto Kit,

653
00:55:48,456 --> 00:55:50,581
according to my clients' statements,

654
00:55:51,206 --> 00:55:53,706
you instructed them to lynch the victim

655
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,706
in order to solve the case.

656
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,290
Do you admit to that?

657
00:56:01,373 --> 00:56:03,623
Yes, I repeatedly requested

658
00:56:03,706 --> 00:56:05,466
that they solve the case
as soon as possible,

659
00:56:05,956 --> 00:56:07,956
but I didn't tell them to lynch

660
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,540
or kill anyone.

661
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:12,831
Superiors often ask their subordinates

662
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,623
to complete their tasks quickly.

663
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:15,831
That is within reason.

664
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:19,081
But there are strict police guidelines

665
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:22,081
regarding force used in various operations

666
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:25,665
which officers must follow.

667
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:28,748
Thus, whether the six defendants
killed anyone

668
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,040
is unrelated to the fact that I asked them

669
00:56:32,123 --> 00:56:33,915
to solve the case quickly.

670
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:37,915
What? You said you would have our backs!

671
00:56:37,998 --> 00:56:39,415
Don't deny it now!

672
00:56:40,165 --> 00:56:41,581
Please calm down.

673
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:42,790
Calm down.

674
00:56:48,498 --> 00:56:50,665
I swear by Almighty God

675
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:56,040
to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

676
00:57:06,873 --> 00:57:08,665
Senior Inspector Cheung Sung-bong,

677
00:57:08,748 --> 00:57:11,206
according to the statements
of all six defendants,

678
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:13,540
you witnessed
the entire process on that day.

679
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:15,373
So I ask you.

680
00:57:15,456 --> 00:57:17,873
Did you see the victim resist arrest

681
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:19,998
and fall to the ground to his death?

682
00:57:24,998 --> 00:57:26,748
First, I must emphasize

683
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:29,998
that we received orders
from our superiors that night

684
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:33,206
to capture the two criminals,
Ho Wai-lok and Wong Kwun.

685
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,248
Your Honor, the witness
is avoiding the question.

686
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:39,665
I only asked
if he saw the victim resisting arrest.

687
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:42,540
Witness, please answer the question.

688
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,205
I had not yet arrived
at the scene when it happened.

689
00:57:51,706 --> 00:57:54,498
So that is clearly a "no."

690
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:59,165
Did you see
the six defendants beating Ho Wai-lok?

691
00:58:23,331 --> 00:58:25,373
Ho Wai-lok was

692
00:58:25,456 --> 00:58:27,040
an extremely dangerous criminal.

693
00:58:27,123 --> 00:58:29,623
I firmly believe that we as police

694
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,331
had to deal with him
with considerable force.

695
00:58:32,415 --> 00:58:33,998
"Considerable force"?

696
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:36,123
What does that mean?

697
00:58:36,206 --> 00:58:39,915
We cannot guess
how much force is "considerable."

698
00:58:40,623 --> 00:58:42,040
Just answer me.

699
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:44,998
Did you see
the defendants beat Ho Wai-lok?

700
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:49,498
And, Inspector Cheung, let me remind you

701
00:58:49,581 --> 00:58:52,873
that you are currently under oath.

702
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:57,498
Yes or no?

703
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,456
Yes or no?

704
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,081
Witness, please answer the question.

705
00:59:18,165 --> 00:59:19,040
Yes.

706
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:20,165
Thank you.

707
00:59:59,623 --> 01:00:01,081
Drink!

708
01:00:01,165 --> 01:00:02,081
You're late! Drink!

709
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,915
Drink it all!

710
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:05,790
Joseph is at the other club.

711
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:07,290
- Let's join him.
- Yes!

712
01:00:07,373 --> 01:00:09,040
Sure, I'll get the bill.

713
01:00:09,123 --> 01:00:10,123
Check, please.

714
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,873
I got it.

715
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:12,956
How nice of you.

716
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,373
- Thank you. You're so generous.
- It's nothing.

717
01:00:16,248 --> 01:00:18,998
Look at that! That looks fancy.

718
01:00:19,081 --> 01:00:19,998
It's nothing special.

719
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:22,081
Nothing? It costs over a million dollars.

720
01:00:22,623 --> 01:00:23,956
I guess so.

721
01:00:24,581 --> 01:00:25,831
Keep the change. Thank you.

722
01:00:25,915 --> 01:00:28,456
Thank my babe. He treated you tonight.

723
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,748
Thank you, babe!

724
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:32,873
- Thank you!
- "Babe!" Gross!

725
01:00:38,165 --> 01:00:39,748
You're really giving it to me?

726
01:00:41,415 --> 01:00:44,290
Yes, whatever makes you happy.

727
01:00:46,373 --> 01:00:48,623
Thank you, you're so sweet.

728
01:00:48,706 --> 01:00:50,165
Babe.

729
01:00:52,456 --> 01:00:53,831
You're taking more?

730
01:00:56,915 --> 01:00:59,165
It's fine, I don't mind.

731
01:01:01,456 --> 01:01:03,123
Wait here. I'm going to take a shower.

732
01:01:21,581 --> 01:01:24,206
Hey! Don't snoop on my phone!

733
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,790
Who is this?

734
01:01:29,623 --> 01:01:31,081
Just a friend.

735
01:01:31,165 --> 01:01:32,748
Give me my phone back.

736
01:01:32,831 --> 01:01:35,290
- No, you are mine!
- You're hurting me!

737
01:01:35,915 --> 01:01:37,498
Bonnie, don't go.

738
01:01:39,873 --> 01:01:41,540
Sorry, I...

739
01:01:41,623 --> 01:01:42,873
Are you stupid?

740
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:45,415
Have you seen what you look like?

741
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,248
It's scary, dude.

742
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:53,248
And you're impotent, damned jailbird!

743
01:01:54,748 --> 01:01:56,665
I hate being called "damned jailbird"!

744
01:01:56,748 --> 01:01:58,706
If not for jail,
would my face look like this?

745
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:00,456
Bitch!

746
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:08,706
Bong, Marine Police
picked up a female corpse

747
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:09,950
at Chai Wan Pier an hour ago.

748
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:11,358
The victim's name is Kwan Mei-you.

749
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:13,040
This watch was found on her body.

750
01:02:13,123 --> 01:02:14,915
CIB traced the serial number.

751
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:18,123
It was worn by Wong Kwun
on the day he was killed.

752
01:02:18,206 --> 01:02:20,498
The victim was last seen in Wan Chai

753
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:23,665
renting a room with Chiu Chi-keung.

754
01:02:23,748 --> 01:02:26,040
They were seen
on surveillance cameras entering a room.

755
01:02:26,123 --> 01:02:29,123
But only Chiu came out,
dragging a suitcase.

756
01:02:33,373 --> 01:02:34,623
What do you think?

757
01:02:42,081 --> 01:02:43,331
Ngo did it.

758
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:46,790
He better not have.

759
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:49,290
Get to work.
Look into Chiu's phone records.

760
01:02:49,373 --> 01:02:50,540
- Yes, sir.
- Roger.

761
01:03:23,956 --> 01:03:25,123
Sit.

762
01:03:36,581 --> 01:03:38,373
This is a huge job.

763
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:42,123
Do you have what it takes?

764
01:03:42,206 --> 01:03:43,456
Don't mess with me.

765
01:03:43,956 --> 01:03:45,915
It's a chance in a million.

766
01:03:45,998 --> 01:03:47,873
Banks seldom switch security systems.

767
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,748
You're not the only interested party.

768
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:52,290
Don't waste our time.

769
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:56,248
Of course I'm interested.

770
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:58,498
Is your information correct?

771
01:03:58,581 --> 01:03:59,498
Of course.

772
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:01,790
If you're in, we will give it to you now.

773
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,956
Bong, the target stopped
at the Mei Fai Building ahead.

774
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:22,540
Keep moving, sir.

775
01:04:23,248 --> 01:04:24,290
Go.

776
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:32,748
Target is moving to three o'clock.

777
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:34,248
Chow, your team will follow Chiu.

778
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:35,331
Roger.

779
01:04:43,998 --> 01:04:46,248
Jaws, let me off at Mei Fai Building.

780
01:04:46,331 --> 01:04:48,081
- Stay on them.
- Yes, sir.

781
01:04:55,415 --> 01:04:56,581
Cops.

782
01:05:02,456 --> 01:05:04,373
Ngo, we're being followed by cops.

783
01:05:05,248 --> 01:05:06,706
Throw out all your SIM cards.

784
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:08,206
Your location?

785
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:09,748
We're heading to Chai Wan.

786
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,290
What is going on?

787
01:05:20,623 --> 01:05:22,040
Why are cops following us?

788
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:24,415
What have you done this time?

789
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:29,373
Sorry.

790
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:32,123
Bastard! Stay alert!

791
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,456
I will follow Wah. You stay with Chiu.

792
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,665
Roger.

793
01:06:16,998 --> 01:06:18,165
Freeze!

794
01:06:18,248 --> 01:06:19,165
Freeze. Hands up.

795
01:06:19,248 --> 01:06:20,248
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

796
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,623
What? I can't go for a run?

797
01:06:22,706 --> 01:06:24,081
You ran me down!

798
01:06:24,165 --> 01:06:25,165
Cuff him.

799
01:06:25,623 --> 01:06:27,415
- Into the car!
- Yes, sir.

800
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,468
Police. Do you have
comprehensive insurance?

801
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:07,123
All units,

802
01:09:07,206 --> 01:09:08,526
don't let Chiu reach the highway.

803
01:09:08,581 --> 01:09:09,941
Stop him at the next intersection.

804
01:09:09,998 --> 01:09:10,998
Roger.

805
01:09:39,206 --> 01:09:40,831
Police at work. Go back into your cars.

806
01:09:40,915 --> 01:09:42,206
Close your doors.

807
01:09:47,956 --> 01:09:50,165
- Do not come out. Hide.
- Stay in the car. Windows up.

808
01:09:51,623 --> 01:09:52,623
Close the door.

809
01:10:00,123 --> 01:10:01,290
Chiu is here.

810
01:10:01,373 --> 01:10:03,123
Freeze! Hands up!

811
01:10:58,373 --> 01:10:59,373
Damn it!

812
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:00,623
Went for a run?

813
01:12:01,206 --> 01:12:02,581
You jumped out of a car!

814
01:12:02,665 --> 01:12:05,040
So what?

815
01:12:05,123 --> 01:12:06,956
There is no law that says I can't!

816
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,206
What's more,

817
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:12,206
you cops drove recklessly
and crashed into me.

818
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:14,706
- I will sue you.
- Don't mess with me!

819
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,998
Chiu is your buddy. You're part of this.

820
01:12:18,081 --> 01:12:19,165
Admit it!

821
01:12:20,165 --> 01:12:22,165
So much bullshit.

822
01:12:22,248 --> 01:12:23,540
Don't you find it annoying?

823
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,040
Is this how cops do things nowadays?

824
01:12:26,915 --> 01:12:28,706
Arresting people on a whim?

825
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,540
You need evidence to charge me.

826
01:12:32,206 --> 01:12:33,373
Where is it?

827
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,831
How are you, Wah?

828
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:54,540
How is your family, Wah?

829
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,040
Your daughter must be six years old now.

830
01:13:00,081 --> 01:13:01,706
She must be in primary school.

831
01:13:02,665 --> 01:13:04,248
Shouldn't you stay out of trouble

832
01:13:05,373 --> 01:13:06,790
and spend more time with her?

833
01:13:06,873 --> 01:13:09,040
You have been caught red-handed.

834
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:12,831
After a few more years in jail,
she won't even recognize you.

835
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:15,290
You must think of her.

836
01:13:15,998 --> 01:13:17,415
Last chance.

837
01:13:23,748 --> 01:13:25,665
Okay.

838
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:27,415
You know what to do.

839
01:13:37,415 --> 01:13:38,706
Get up!

840
01:13:40,956 --> 01:13:42,040
No more!

841
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:53,956
I'm sorry.

842
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,540
I was greedy.

843
01:13:58,123 --> 01:13:59,831
I stole Wong Kwun's watch.

844
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:02,915
There must be a way to rescue Wah.

845
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,748
He can keep secrets.

846
01:14:05,831 --> 01:14:07,456
He won't rat us out.

847
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,040
We still have time.

848
01:14:12,831 --> 01:14:14,331
Chiu has been caught.

849
01:14:15,415 --> 01:14:16,581
But I know the police

850
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:18,415
don't have enough evidence to charge us.

851
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:19,665
Stay cool.

852
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:21,623
There is nothing we can do.

853
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:23,623
We're on the same team.

854
01:14:23,706 --> 01:14:25,081
When someone makes a mistake,

855
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:26,665
the others have to make up for it.

856
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:28,623
It's the same with anyone.

857
01:14:30,581 --> 01:14:32,040
The question now is

858
01:14:32,123 --> 01:14:34,623
how we can rescue Wah

859
01:14:35,581 --> 01:14:37,248
from Cheung Sung-bong.

860
01:14:39,498 --> 01:14:40,873
There is only one way.

861
01:14:49,123 --> 01:14:50,540
How many times have I said it?

862
01:14:50,623 --> 01:14:51,956
If anybody screws up,

863
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,748
they will have hell to pay.

864
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:23,790
These are former policemen.

865
01:15:23,873 --> 01:15:26,373
Four years ago,
they were jailed for manslaughter.

866
01:15:26,456 --> 01:15:27,873
They were released six months ago.

867
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:29,206
We have reason to believe

868
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:32,123
they were involved
in several armed robberies and murders.

869
01:15:32,206 --> 01:15:34,748
We have checked all border records.

870
01:15:34,831 --> 01:15:38,456
Last week, they sent
all their families out of Hong Kong.

871
01:15:39,123 --> 01:15:42,290
It looks like
something major will happen soon.

872
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:45,373
We only have evidence to charge Chiu.

873
01:15:45,873 --> 01:15:48,248
We must catch them all.

874
01:15:48,331 --> 01:15:49,540
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

875
01:15:49,623 --> 01:15:50,748
Okay, let's go.

876
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:51,831
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

877
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:52,915
Stop, all of you!

878
01:15:53,665 --> 01:15:55,206
Who gave you permission to go?

879
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,290
I did.

880
01:15:57,373 --> 01:15:59,206
Do you know
how many complaints we have had?

881
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:01,456
- Bong, we need to talk.
- Set out!

882
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:02,540
Bong!

883
01:16:07,123 --> 01:16:08,123
Bong.

884
01:16:09,373 --> 01:16:10,415
Please.

885
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,831
I know how you feel.
I don't like it either.

886
01:16:19,915 --> 01:16:21,331
But you must realize this.

887
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:23,915
So many colleagues died
last time at the mall.

888
01:16:23,998 --> 01:16:25,623
We must not make any more mistakes.

889
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:27,206
Moreover,

890
01:16:27,665 --> 01:16:29,665
I have handed this case
back to Officer Tai.

891
01:16:29,748 --> 01:16:32,456
- We will let it go now, okay?
- Not okay.

892
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,456
- It's not okay.
- This is an order.

893
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,016
- There's no way around it.
- Not okay.

894
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,456
You're a policeman!

895
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:38,665
So are you.

896
01:16:40,206 --> 01:16:41,331
It's an order.

897
01:16:41,415 --> 01:16:42,956
What can I do? Tell me.

898
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,165
Don't lord your title over me, okay?

899
01:16:46,248 --> 01:16:47,623
- Beau.
- I can't...

900
01:16:47,706 --> 01:16:48,956
Try to be human about this.

901
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,415
So many colleagues have died.
What else can I do?

902
01:16:54,373 --> 01:16:55,956
You're putting me in a bad spot.

903
01:16:57,873 --> 01:16:59,748
You can handle it, okay?

904
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,040
Okay. Let's go.

905
01:17:02,123 --> 01:17:03,415
- Bong.
- Bong.

906
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:06,456
Ngo and his men are here.
They said they came to report a case.

907
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,123
What a big welcome!

908
01:17:29,206 --> 01:17:30,956
We are just here to report a case.

909
01:17:35,248 --> 01:17:36,290
Perfect.

910
01:17:36,915 --> 01:17:38,081
You saved us a trip.

911
01:17:38,165 --> 01:17:39,290
Make some coffee.

912
01:17:40,706 --> 01:17:42,956
Yau Kong-ngo,
in these six months after your release,

913
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,123
there is no record
of your employment, residence,

914
01:17:45,206 --> 01:17:47,248
travel, bank, or any other records.

915
01:17:47,331 --> 01:17:48,623
You must have something planned.

916
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,831
Wong Kwun was killed two weeks ago,

917
01:17:51,915 --> 01:17:53,165
and his goods were taken.

918
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:56,540
We lost eight colleagues. Did you do it?

919
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:58,998
You had a conflict with Wong Kwun.

920
01:17:59,081 --> 01:18:00,456
That is reason and motive.

921
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,706
Admit it.

922
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:04,081
Wah confessed

923
01:18:04,165 --> 01:18:06,206
for the sake of his wife and daughter.

924
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:09,831
He said you were involved
as the mastermind.

925
01:18:09,915 --> 01:18:11,706
I don't believe that.

926
01:18:12,498 --> 01:18:14,373
You must have come prepared.

927
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,040
Please explain.

928
01:18:24,706 --> 01:18:26,206
What are you laughing about?

929
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:31,873
I was in that seat for over a decade.

930
01:18:32,873 --> 01:18:35,956
I have said the same things you have said.

931
01:18:38,248 --> 01:18:40,040
Take a guess whether I believe you.

932
01:18:45,456 --> 01:18:47,581
I came today to report a case.

933
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:49,706
My friend is missing.

934
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:51,165
His name is Chiu Chi-keung.

935
01:18:51,248 --> 01:18:53,290
You bastard cop-killer!

936
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:07,081
Fine.

937
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,665
Since you suspect us,

938
01:19:09,748 --> 01:19:11,248
we're willing to cooperate.

939
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:14,248
We will stay here for 48 hours,

940
01:19:14,331 --> 01:19:15,498
starting now.

941
01:19:16,248 --> 01:19:19,040
Give me a coffee, please.

942
01:19:19,123 --> 01:19:21,123
With milk, thank you.

943
01:19:21,206 --> 01:19:23,415
Right away. Drink it if you dare.

944
01:19:34,456 --> 01:19:35,706
He makes sense.

945
01:19:38,415 --> 01:19:39,915
I will get you your coffee.

946
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:56,790
Less sugar and fresh milk.

947
01:19:57,373 --> 01:19:58,456
Thank you.

948
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,706
Some things haven't changed.

949
01:20:07,373 --> 01:20:09,573
I haven't smelled
the interrogation room in a long time.

950
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,800
I remember
the first time I took a statement.

951
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:15,706
You were next to me, right over there.

952
01:20:18,331 --> 01:20:20,498
I remember. It was Hoklo Mun.

953
01:20:22,123 --> 01:20:23,763
I was the bad cop. You were the good cop.

954
01:20:24,498 --> 01:20:26,298
You were so scared
that you got a stomachache.

955
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,540
You love to remember my worst moments.

956
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,206
Well?

957
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:36,623
Chiu has vanished.

958
01:20:37,206 --> 01:20:38,706
We are trying to find him.

959
01:20:39,415 --> 01:20:40,956
I have told him many times

960
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,581
to stay away from shady guys

961
01:20:42,665 --> 01:20:44,040
or he would get in trouble.

962
01:20:44,123 --> 01:20:45,165
See?

963
01:20:45,248 --> 01:20:47,873
Great, since you are here,

964
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:50,831
what can you tell us?

965
01:20:51,581 --> 01:20:53,873
Bong, if not even you
can catch those bad guys

966
01:20:54,373 --> 01:20:56,998
despite all the colleagues
who died along the way,

967
01:20:57,081 --> 01:20:58,581
how can I hope to help you?

968
01:21:04,331 --> 01:21:06,748
Of course you can. You're so clever.

969
01:21:06,831 --> 01:21:08,498
I have a question for you.

970
01:21:09,706 --> 01:21:10,998
Who is so bold,

971
01:21:11,831 --> 01:21:14,040
has so little regard
for the law, so heartless,

972
01:21:14,623 --> 01:21:15,873
and so cold-blooded?

973
01:21:15,956 --> 01:21:18,123
Also, arresting them all
would bring peace.

974
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,040
What is your opinion on that?

975
01:21:23,248 --> 01:21:24,706
I don't have an opinion.

976
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:26,456
Perhaps they have something against you.

977
01:21:27,248 --> 01:21:29,415
In the end,
you need evidence to charge people.

978
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:31,415
Without it,

979
01:21:32,706 --> 01:21:33,873
you can't do anything.

980
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:36,206
We will get evidence sooner or later.

981
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:40,915
Being so high-profile,
they are bound to make a mistake.

982
01:21:40,998 --> 01:21:42,831
Once they do, we will catch them.

983
01:21:44,665 --> 01:21:46,123
You are so confident.

984
01:21:47,248 --> 01:21:49,998
I worry that more colleagues
will die when the time comes.

985
01:21:50,081 --> 01:21:52,540
This time, the bad guys will die first.

986
01:21:53,873 --> 01:21:56,581
As policemen,
we can't worry about those things

987
01:21:56,665 --> 01:22:00,915
or we would have become postmen, right?

988
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:05,040
Postmen have it made,
just attending to mail all day.

989
01:22:05,915 --> 01:22:07,248
You seem to be

990
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:10,373
attending funerals all day.

991
01:22:19,165 --> 01:22:20,790
Let's see who will attend whose.

992
01:22:37,581 --> 01:22:38,915
You're different from them.

993
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:41,456
If you wish to become
the prosecution's witness,

994
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,748
it is not too late.

995
01:22:43,331 --> 01:22:44,873
I'm here to report a missing person.

996
01:22:45,373 --> 01:22:48,581
Don't interrogate me like I'm a criminal.

997
01:22:48,665 --> 01:22:51,123
I came to give you clues

998
01:22:51,206 --> 01:22:53,623
to help you find Chiu faster.

999
01:22:53,706 --> 01:22:56,706
The bad guys are all out there,
yet you're here talking to me.

1000
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:58,165
Damn all this.

1001
01:23:07,123 --> 01:23:08,623
More coffee!

1002
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:18,498
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

1003
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:20,748
Okay, from the top.

1004
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:24,873
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

1005
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:27,081
Okay, stand still.

1006
01:23:27,165 --> 01:23:29,665
Watch me. Good job.

1007
01:23:37,165 --> 01:23:39,081
Chiu is dead. Police found his body.

1008
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:41,151
They found a letter at the scene.

1009
01:23:41,206 --> 01:23:42,915
He took responsibility for everything.

1010
01:23:42,998 --> 01:23:44,915
With him dead, all the leads are gone.

1011
01:23:44,998 --> 01:23:46,623
It will be hard for us to charge them.

1012
01:23:58,915 --> 01:24:00,498
Everybody, out.

1013
01:24:17,206 --> 01:24:19,665
You need evidence to arrest people?

1014
01:24:29,415 --> 01:24:31,331
Evidence! Arrest!

1015
01:24:32,831 --> 01:24:34,331
That's brave.

1016
01:24:34,415 --> 01:24:36,040
What I am about to say

1017
01:24:36,123 --> 01:24:37,998
will not be a legitimate testimony.

1018
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:39,373
You cannot use it in court.

1019
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:42,706
You're killing your own buddies now?

1020
01:24:44,623 --> 01:24:45,748
You killed Chiu.

1021
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:48,456
It was you at the Wong Kwun incident.

1022
01:24:49,748 --> 01:24:52,998
You also killed Yiu and all our men.

1023
01:24:55,165 --> 01:24:57,498
Why did you kill all those innocent men?

1024
01:24:59,081 --> 01:25:00,790
- Why?
- Innocent?

1025
01:25:01,998 --> 01:25:03,831
Who can be more innocent than us?

1026
01:25:04,748 --> 01:25:06,706
We gave our all to the police force.

1027
01:25:07,706 --> 01:25:08,998
We solved the case.

1028
01:25:09,081 --> 01:25:10,915
In court, you only needed to say one word,

1029
01:25:10,998 --> 01:25:13,206
and the five of us
wouldn't have gone to jail.

1030
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:16,790
But you gave up on us and put us in jail!

1031
01:25:16,873 --> 01:25:18,290
Every night in jail,

1032
01:25:18,373 --> 01:25:20,915
the people we had arrested
would seek revenge on us.

1033
01:25:20,998 --> 01:25:22,331
Here. These.

1034
01:25:22,415 --> 01:25:23,998
Is that innocence?

1035
01:25:24,081 --> 01:25:25,956
You think you're so noble

1036
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,956
because you spoke one truth in court.

1037
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,290
You defended a crook
over your own brothers.

1038
01:25:30,373 --> 01:25:31,998
Coke was a criminal!

1039
01:25:32,081 --> 01:25:34,581
Don't confuse right and wrong.

1040
01:25:34,665 --> 01:25:36,915
You went too far and needed to pay for it.

1041
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:38,331
You committed murder.

1042
01:25:38,415 --> 01:25:40,415
You had to go to jail.

1043
01:25:40,915 --> 01:25:41,998
Is that innocence?

1044
01:25:42,081 --> 01:25:43,081
What did you do?

1045
01:25:43,123 --> 01:25:44,956
You killed your colleagues and buddies.

1046
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:47,998
And you killed Yiu!

1047
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:50,623
You call that righteousness?

1048
01:25:51,331 --> 01:25:53,248
You were settling a private grudge.

1049
01:25:53,331 --> 01:25:54,540
If you wanted revenge,

1050
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:58,373
why didn't you just come to me?

1051
01:26:02,581 --> 01:26:04,123
That was the original plan,

1052
01:26:04,831 --> 01:26:06,665
but you weren't at the mall that day.

1053
01:26:16,498 --> 01:26:18,540
Forty-eight hours have gone by so fast.

1054
01:26:19,248 --> 01:26:20,373
You have to let me go.

1055
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:23,456
Bong!

1056
01:26:24,748 --> 01:26:27,998
Your wife is being
held hostage at the dance hall.

1057
01:26:28,081 --> 01:26:29,290
There's a bomb.

1058
01:26:31,248 --> 01:26:32,415
You bastard!

1059
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:15,498
Open fire at the scene.
PNC has been shot and injured.

1060
01:27:15,581 --> 01:27:17,040
Bong, it's Seto Kit.

1061
01:27:17,123 --> 01:27:18,723
He has your wife and demands to see you.

1062
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:19,915
He fired three shots.

1063
01:27:22,206 --> 01:27:24,581
Bong, in addition to your wife,

1064
01:27:24,665 --> 01:27:26,956
there are 10 children and 4 parents.

1065
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,320
It's a very dangerous situation.

1066
01:27:28,873 --> 01:27:31,123
Also, Seto Kit has a bomb around his neck.

1067
01:27:31,206 --> 01:27:32,748
EOD checked and said that

1068
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,456
there is a detector linked to his pulse.

1069
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:36,331
The design is very complex.

1070
01:27:36,415 --> 01:27:39,498
The bomb squad has
no idea how to defuse it yet.

1071
01:27:39,581 --> 01:27:40,623
What can we do?

1072
01:27:41,331 --> 01:27:44,123
If we don't want the bomb to explode,

1073
01:27:44,206 --> 01:27:46,373
all we can do is
stop his pulse by shooting him dead.

1074
01:27:48,998 --> 01:27:50,123
One more problem.

1075
01:27:50,206 --> 01:27:53,331
Seto cuffed himself to your wife.

1076
01:27:57,165 --> 01:27:58,415
Stop!

1077
01:27:58,498 --> 01:28:00,540
Do you want more people to die?

1078
01:28:00,623 --> 01:28:02,123
Where is Cheung Sung-bong?

1079
01:28:02,206 --> 01:28:05,248
I'm here. Sir, let's talk it out.

1080
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:07,998
Release my wife and the other hostages.

1081
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:10,998
Come out. We will talk all you want.

1082
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:14,040
Shut up!

1083
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,290
Are you finally here?

1084
01:28:18,873 --> 01:28:19,956
I'm here.

1085
01:28:21,998 --> 01:28:23,040
What do you want me to do?

1086
01:28:23,123 --> 01:28:24,456
The men back there, get out.

1087
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:25,831
I only want to see him.

1088
01:28:25,915 --> 01:28:28,373
Get out! Back out!

1089
01:28:29,123 --> 01:28:30,206
Okay.

1090
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:32,415
Calm down.

1091
01:28:33,456 --> 01:28:35,165
Let the EOD

1092
01:28:35,248 --> 01:28:37,415
help you take off the bomb, okay?

1093
01:28:37,498 --> 01:28:40,998
If you want to help me, listen up

1094
01:28:41,081 --> 01:28:44,706
or my wife and daughter will die.

1095
01:28:46,206 --> 01:28:47,540
Calm down.

1096
01:28:48,165 --> 01:28:50,331
Let me finish first!

1097
01:28:52,331 --> 01:28:53,748
Four years ago,

1098
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:55,831
my behavior was inexcusable.

1099
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,873
I said you had to rescue him.

1100
01:28:58,956 --> 01:29:01,498
I forced Ngo to be more aggressive.

1101
01:29:01,581 --> 01:29:02,915
I also said

1102
01:29:02,998 --> 01:29:04,581
that if you fail to rescue Mr. Fok,

1103
01:29:04,665 --> 01:29:06,790
the whole team will be fired.

1104
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,873
I forced them onto this path.

1105
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,123
I was greedy for the credit.

1106
01:29:14,165 --> 01:29:16,915
I wanted to be on S T Fok's good side.

1107
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,706
I should have taken responsibility,

1108
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:22,498
but I didn't.

1109
01:29:23,706 --> 01:29:25,665
They were innocent.

1110
01:29:26,873 --> 01:29:29,123
I am the shame of the police force.

1111
01:29:29,206 --> 01:29:31,790
- I am the shame of the police force!
- I hear you, okay?

1112
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:33,706
Bong.

1113
01:29:34,415 --> 01:29:36,040
You love to hear the truth, don't you?

1114
01:29:36,998 --> 01:29:38,415
That was the truth.

1115
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:41,581
But we don't think he was sincere enough.

1116
01:29:41,665 --> 01:29:43,165
Let's give him 30 more seconds

1117
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,498
and hope he can be more sincere.

1118
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,748
Why did this happen?

1119
01:29:54,831 --> 01:29:57,165
EOD, withdraw.
Everyone has to leave immediately.

1120
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,081
Bong!

1121
01:29:58,165 --> 01:29:59,206
Retreat now!

1122
01:29:59,956 --> 01:30:00,956
Stay away!

1123
01:30:02,998 --> 01:30:04,165
Stay away!

1124
01:30:06,623 --> 01:30:08,331
Give me wire cutters. Hurry!

1125
01:30:08,831 --> 01:30:10,665
Wire cutters, now!

1126
01:30:10,748 --> 01:30:13,081
I have already confessed.

1127
01:30:13,165 --> 01:30:14,956
Take the children and go! Quickly!

1128
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,415
- Go!
- Run!

1129
01:30:16,498 --> 01:30:18,873
Help them, quickly! Go, evacuate!

1130
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:20,165
Get the children out of here.

1131
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,081
Everybody, out! It's going to blow! Run!

1132
01:30:22,165 --> 01:30:23,790
Bong, get out now!

1133
01:30:24,415 --> 01:30:26,415
Go. Leave me.

1134
01:30:27,123 --> 01:30:28,248
We will be fine.

1135
01:30:29,081 --> 01:30:30,706
The timer is connected to his pulse.

1136
01:30:31,206 --> 01:30:32,456
If his heart stops,

1137
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:33,623
so will the timer.

1138
01:30:33,706 --> 01:30:36,415
Shoot him dead
if you want to save your wife.

1139
01:30:37,956 --> 01:30:39,206
Sir, there is no more time.

1140
01:30:40,665 --> 01:30:41,915
You can do this.

1141
01:30:41,998 --> 01:30:43,081
Okay.

1142
01:30:44,665 --> 01:30:45,665
Fire!

1143
01:30:57,706 --> 01:30:58,790
It's over.

1144
01:30:59,623 --> 01:31:00,498
You're okay.

1145
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:02,873
I hope you understand
how little control we had back then.

1146
01:31:05,665 --> 01:31:06,706
Good luck.

1147
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,415
Get everyone out, now!

1148
01:31:42,081 --> 01:31:45,248
Officer Cheung, we are
from Internal Investigations.

1149
01:31:45,331 --> 01:31:49,415
You are suspected of
intentionally shooting at the SDU,

1150
01:31:49,498 --> 01:31:53,540
disobeying multiple orders,
and violating police policies.

1151
01:31:53,623 --> 01:31:55,248
This is the warrant for your arrest.

1152
01:31:55,331 --> 01:31:57,915
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

1153
01:31:57,998 --> 01:31:59,638
Please cooperate with our investigation...

1154
01:31:59,665 --> 01:32:03,248
Doctor, how are my wife and baby?

1155
01:32:03,331 --> 01:32:06,998
Mrs. Cheung's blood pressure
and heart rate are high

1156
01:32:07,081 --> 01:32:09,706
due to the trauma.

1157
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:12,331
Please don't worry. She is stabilized.

1158
01:32:12,415 --> 01:32:14,081
- Thank you.
- Please don't worry.

1159
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:17,623
Officer Cheung,

1160
01:32:17,706 --> 01:32:20,498
as a fellow officer, don't make this hard.

1161
01:32:21,165 --> 01:32:22,805
Are you serious? His wife is unconscious.

1162
01:32:22,873 --> 01:32:25,081
Fine, I will go with you.

1163
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:42,915
Wing.

1164
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:45,623
Well?

1165
01:32:45,706 --> 01:32:47,165
Has everything been arranged?

1166
01:32:48,248 --> 01:32:49,665
Yes, long ago.

1167
01:32:49,748 --> 01:32:53,206
I have the most powerful guns
and bombs ready for you.

1168
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:57,456
The bank vault
and security details are all here.

1169
01:32:59,165 --> 01:33:00,248
But...

1170
01:33:03,456 --> 01:33:04,748
You are not part of this.

1171
01:33:04,831 --> 01:33:06,081
What do you mean?

1172
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:08,831
You dare ask me?

1173
01:33:08,915 --> 01:33:10,790
You have been exposed.

1174
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,040
You are now fugitives.

1175
01:33:13,123 --> 01:33:14,956
I don't want to go to jail yet.

1176
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,165
Don't give me that.

1177
01:33:16,248 --> 01:33:17,373
You would give up on

1178
01:33:17,456 --> 01:33:19,040
100 million USD?

1179
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:22,248
I said you have no part in this,

1180
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:24,081
but I never said I wouldn't do it.

1181
01:33:26,331 --> 01:33:28,873
To tell you the truth,
I have found another partner.

1182
01:33:29,623 --> 01:33:31,248
You may go.

1183
01:33:38,248 --> 01:33:39,290
What?

1184
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:41,456
Why are you still here?

1185
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,581
Get out!

1186
01:34:37,248 --> 01:34:38,540
You have no part

1187
01:34:38,623 --> 01:34:40,165
in this job either.

1188
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:58,581
Officer Cheung.

1189
01:34:59,456 --> 01:35:02,748
That's it then. Wednesday night, 8 p.m.

1190
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,581
What are you waiting for? Let's begin.

1191
01:35:06,665 --> 01:35:08,456
I have a meeting to get to.

1192
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:09,540
Turn it off.

1193
01:35:14,498 --> 01:35:16,415
Senior Inspector Cheung Sung-bong,

1194
01:35:16,498 --> 01:35:18,581
this is an internal investigation hearing

1195
01:35:18,665 --> 01:35:21,581
presided over by SACP Lok Chi-fai.

1196
01:35:21,665 --> 01:35:24,331
The results will be submitted
to the Secretary of Justice.

1197
01:35:24,415 --> 01:35:26,790
You may be convicted. Do you understand?

1198
01:35:30,081 --> 01:35:33,373
You shot at the SDU team. Am I correct?

1199
01:35:35,581 --> 01:35:36,623
You are correct.

1200
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:39,456
If you do not have
a reasonable explanation,

1201
01:35:40,081 --> 01:35:41,761
the Department of Justice will charge you.

1202
01:35:41,831 --> 01:35:43,290
You may be jailed.

1203
01:35:43,373 --> 01:35:44,790
Do you understand?

1204
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,040
Yes.

1205
01:35:54,373 --> 01:35:56,165
- Excuse us, sirs.
- What are you doing here?

1206
01:35:58,915 --> 01:36:00,831
No auditors are allowed
at the hearing. Get out.

1207
01:36:00,915 --> 01:36:04,498
I know it is wrong of us to barge in.

1208
01:36:04,581 --> 01:36:06,165
But we hope

1209
01:36:06,248 --> 01:36:09,331
you will be merciful and not fire him.

1210
01:36:09,415 --> 01:36:11,206
Regardless of your relationship with him,

1211
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:13,206
per regulations, you must leave now.

1212
01:36:13,290 --> 01:36:15,581
Sir, we are a team.

1213
01:36:15,665 --> 01:36:17,706
If he did anything wrong, so did we.

1214
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:20,123
We must all bear the responsibility, sir!

1215
01:36:30,998 --> 01:36:33,206
The police force is
about responsibility and discipline,

1216
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:34,290
not emotions.

1217
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:36,831
If you don't leave now,

1218
01:36:36,915 --> 01:36:38,415
you will be disciplined.

1219
01:37:06,415 --> 01:37:07,706
Sirs,

1220
01:37:11,665 --> 01:37:13,915
the world really is

1221
01:37:14,623 --> 01:37:16,540
not just black and white.

1222
01:37:18,123 --> 01:37:20,415
There are a lot of grey areas.

1223
01:37:22,415 --> 01:37:25,665
In this incident, I really had no choice.

1224
01:37:26,915 --> 01:37:27,998
True,

1225
01:37:28,081 --> 01:37:30,665
I was wrong to shoot at policemen.

1226
01:37:32,165 --> 01:37:33,248
But I believe

1227
01:37:33,331 --> 01:37:35,206
that anyone else in my position

1228
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:37,498
would not have made another choice

1229
01:37:37,581 --> 01:37:38,581
because...

1230
01:37:39,956 --> 01:37:41,373
I was saving my wife.

1231
01:37:44,206 --> 01:37:46,040
I think you
would have done the same thing.

1232
01:37:49,748 --> 01:37:52,290
I entered the Academy when I was 19.

1233
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:55,831
I understand how to play this game.

1234
01:37:55,915 --> 01:37:59,415
Today, many people
who join the police force

1235
01:38:00,498 --> 01:38:03,040
think about making connections
rather than catching bad guys.

1236
01:38:03,665 --> 01:38:05,456
True, we learned a lot,

1237
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:07,331
but all we do

1238
01:38:07,415 --> 01:38:09,831
is cover our asses and wait.

1239
01:38:10,415 --> 01:38:11,581
I get why I'm here.

1240
01:38:12,581 --> 01:38:14,331
Sir, it's just a job.

1241
01:38:14,415 --> 01:38:15,956
Must we risk our lives?

1242
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,040
But at the right time,

1243
01:38:22,623 --> 01:38:26,290
we can be very persistent for one cause.

1244
01:38:27,248 --> 01:38:28,956
We can even sacrifice ourselves,

1245
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,540
ignoring our own safety.

1246
01:38:31,831 --> 01:38:33,373
What are we thinking?

1247
01:38:33,456 --> 01:38:36,540
Not how to do less work,

1248
01:38:37,331 --> 01:38:39,498
but how to do better work.

1249
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:47,581
Anything else?

1250
01:38:49,081 --> 01:38:50,081
Yes.

1251
01:38:52,831 --> 01:38:56,165
Regretfully, these criminals will escape.

1252
01:38:56,873 --> 01:38:58,373
I couldn't catch them.

1253
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:11,831
It's decided.

1254
01:39:17,873 --> 01:39:19,040
Today's hearing

1255
01:39:20,915 --> 01:39:23,206
is adjourned

1256
01:39:24,081 --> 01:39:25,790
because I'm not feeling well.

1257
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:29,040
We shall continue tomorrow
at the same time.

1258
01:39:29,123 --> 01:39:31,915
I cannot control
whether the DOJ will charge you.

1259
01:39:33,206 --> 01:39:34,998
But you are still a policeman

1260
01:39:35,665 --> 01:39:37,040
for the next 24 hours.

1261
01:39:39,373 --> 01:39:40,748
Don't disappoint me.

1262
01:39:44,498 --> 01:39:46,373
Hurry and catch those bastards.

1263
01:39:48,123 --> 01:39:49,123
Thank you, sir.

1264
01:39:51,456 --> 01:39:52,790
Thank you, sir.

1265
01:39:54,748 --> 01:39:55,748
Thank you, sir.

1266
01:40:08,623 --> 01:40:10,915
Bong, Central Crime Unit
has taken over the case.

1267
01:40:10,998 --> 01:40:12,998
They found a USB drive on Ma Gau-wing

1268
01:40:13,081 --> 01:40:15,165
containing all
the security data of BPA Bank.

1269
01:40:15,248 --> 01:40:17,665
They suspect a bank truck robbery.

1270
01:40:17,748 --> 01:40:19,331
All manpower is stationed there.

1271
01:40:34,915 --> 01:40:36,373
Got it. Thank you.

1272
01:40:37,456 --> 01:40:40,123
Bong, we just learned
that someone named David Wong

1273
01:40:40,206 --> 01:40:41,373
is among the dead.

1274
01:40:41,456 --> 01:40:44,415
He was the head of security
for Fok's HK Fortune Banking.

1275
01:40:44,498 --> 01:40:46,998
There is a shareholders meeting
at HK Fortune Banking today.

1276
01:40:47,081 --> 01:40:49,040
That means S T Fok
has returned from the US.

1277
01:40:52,331 --> 01:40:54,956
It is said that all merchants are evil.

1278
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,998
Doing business is like warfare.

1279
01:40:58,081 --> 01:41:00,081
You can't win
without a bright and clear mind.

1280
01:41:00,165 --> 01:41:02,206
Who would want to be cannon fodder?

1281
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:03,456
It's simple.

1282
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,581
The lower class earns money with labor.

1283
01:41:05,665 --> 01:41:07,998
The middle class
earns money with knowledge.

1284
01:41:09,165 --> 01:41:11,081
Officer Hsia, the target isn't here.

1285
01:41:11,165 --> 01:41:13,331
- They already let you out?
- The target is not here.

1286
01:41:13,415 --> 01:41:15,248
The USB drive found on Ma Gau-wing

1287
01:41:15,331 --> 01:41:17,915
was planted to misdirect the police.

1288
01:41:18,498 --> 01:41:21,290
Look at me! The target is at Fok's bank.

1289
01:41:21,373 --> 01:41:23,290
HK Fortune Banking!

1290
01:41:23,373 --> 01:41:24,623
Prove it.

1291
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:29,373
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1292
01:41:34,498 --> 01:41:36,165
The evidence in this USB drive

1293
01:41:36,248 --> 01:41:38,040
is the bank truck routes

1294
01:41:38,123 --> 01:41:40,248
and security guard shift changes.

1295
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:42,915
Everything points to the target being

1296
01:41:42,998 --> 01:41:44,998
this bank's cash-in-transit truck.

1297
01:41:45,081 --> 01:41:47,206
There is no harm
in sending some men there.

1298
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:07,540
What do you think you're doing?

1299
01:42:07,623 --> 01:42:09,498
Don't try anything! What are you doing?

1300
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:13,706
Don't mess with us.

1301
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:16,540
Look, I won't transfer any manpower.

1302
01:42:16,623 --> 01:42:17,956
Why don't you go there yourselve

1303
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:21,040
since you are used to breaking the rules?

1304
01:42:21,123 --> 01:42:22,665
Just stay out of my way.

1305
01:42:22,748 --> 01:42:23,831
Understand?

1306
01:42:24,706 --> 01:42:26,873
We are here
to give you leads, not get in your way.

1307
01:42:26,956 --> 01:42:28,498
What you are doing here is useless!

1308
01:42:28,581 --> 01:42:30,461
- Understand?
- You are in no position to speak!

1309
01:42:30,498 --> 01:42:32,581
Do you know you have
violated your superior's orders?

1310
01:42:32,665 --> 01:42:33,905
I have the right to report you!

1311
01:42:37,248 --> 01:42:38,456
Control Room, done.

1312
01:42:42,331 --> 01:42:43,956
Mr. Fok, we are ready.

1313
01:42:44,581 --> 01:42:45,706
Don't try anything stupid!

1314
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,498
It's useless for me to come in here.

1315
01:42:54,581 --> 01:42:57,206
- This door is controlled by security...
- Come here.

1316
01:43:05,873 --> 01:43:07,998
Open it!

1317
01:43:08,581 --> 01:43:11,415
Don't shoot!

1318
01:43:17,373 --> 01:43:19,581
I beg you. I was wrong.

1319
01:43:19,665 --> 01:43:20,998
I did you wrong.

1320
01:43:21,665 --> 01:43:23,290
I am grateful you rescued me.

1321
01:43:23,915 --> 01:43:26,581
My statement in court wasn't aimed at you.

1322
01:43:27,206 --> 01:43:28,248
That's not what I meant.

1323
01:43:28,331 --> 01:43:30,415
But you did kill someone!

1324
01:43:31,748 --> 01:43:33,956
Please take all this money.

1325
01:43:34,456 --> 01:43:36,373
I can arrange your escape
anywhere you choose.

1326
01:44:08,581 --> 01:44:09,456
Call for backup!

1327
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:10,415
Calling Control.

1328
01:44:10,498 --> 01:44:12,298
Suspects discovered
leaving HK Fortune Banking

1329
01:44:12,373 --> 01:44:13,748
and heading towards Tsim Sha Tsui.

1330
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:15,351
They are believed to be heavily armed.

1331
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:16,623
Requesting backup.

1332
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:24,415
Bong, we have news.

1333
01:44:24,498 --> 01:44:27,165
S T Fok's body has been found
in HK Fortune Banking's vault.

1334
01:44:38,873 --> 01:44:39,873
Sit tight!

1335
01:45:09,915 --> 01:45:10,998
Get out of here!

1336
01:45:11,081 --> 01:45:12,331
It's dangerous!

1337
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:33,956
Move! Out of the way!

1338
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:38,956
Out of the way!

1339
01:45:39,706 --> 01:45:40,706
Out of the way!

1340
01:45:59,956 --> 01:46:02,081
Get out of the way! It's dangerous!

1341
01:46:02,165 --> 01:46:03,540
Move!

1342
01:46:07,081 --> 01:46:08,165
Out of the way!

1343
01:46:20,706 --> 01:46:23,581
Ngo, drop your weapons!

1344
01:46:24,206 --> 01:46:25,665
You won't get away with this!

1345
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:32,165
Fuck you!

1346
01:46:51,498 --> 01:46:53,331
Jaws, cover fire!

1347
01:47:00,248 --> 01:47:01,331
Forward!

1348
01:47:31,498 --> 01:47:33,498
Bong, they are crazy!

1349
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,498
Can everyone get away?

1350
01:48:47,581 --> 01:48:48,831
Easy as pie!

1351
01:48:48,915 --> 01:48:50,206
Let's eat hot pot tonight!

1352
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:51,623
Roger!

1353
01:50:05,373 --> 01:50:06,790
Mom!

1354
01:50:09,248 --> 01:50:10,081
Surrender.

1355
01:50:10,165 --> 01:50:11,956
- What do you mean?
- Listen to me, Wah.

1356
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:13,160
Do you want everyone to die?

1357
01:50:13,206 --> 01:50:15,206
Drop your gun! I said, drop it!

1358
01:50:15,290 --> 01:50:17,040
It's not too late to surrender.

1359
01:50:17,831 --> 01:50:19,623
- Put down your gun!
- Okay!

1360
01:50:19,706 --> 01:50:21,748
I will. Please calm down.

1361
01:50:22,581 --> 01:50:24,081
You used to be a cop too.

1362
01:50:24,165 --> 01:50:25,831
Why are you taking a little girl hostage?

1363
01:50:25,915 --> 01:50:27,373
You have a daughter too!

1364
01:50:30,581 --> 01:50:31,623
Come here!

1365
01:51:20,248 --> 01:51:21,498
Ngo.

1366
01:51:25,081 --> 01:51:26,498
I can't go on.

1367
01:51:36,748 --> 01:51:37,748
Hang in there.

1368
01:51:48,248 --> 01:51:49,581
I need to rest.

1369
01:51:54,415 --> 01:51:56,055
Let's be buddies again in our next lives.

1370
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:04,623
Run!

1371
01:52:57,831 --> 01:52:59,165
You have nowhere to run.

1372
01:53:00,831 --> 01:53:02,081
Surrender.

1373
01:53:03,831 --> 01:53:05,165
And go back to jail?

1374
01:53:06,748 --> 01:53:09,873
You say one thing and do something else.

1375
01:53:09,956 --> 01:53:11,415
Ching was that way too.

1376
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:13,915
So as soon as I got out, I killed her.

1377
01:56:34,165 --> 01:56:35,290
Get up!

1378
01:59:40,290 --> 01:59:41,540
I have lost.

1379
01:59:42,081 --> 01:59:44,040
But I won't bow to my fate!

1380
01:59:45,081 --> 01:59:48,748
I had one thought when I was in jail.

1381
02:00:01,123 --> 02:00:02,498
If it had been you

1382
02:00:02,581 --> 02:00:04,206
who chased Coke that day,

1383
02:00:05,331 --> 02:00:06,915
would our destinies

1384
02:00:07,956 --> 02:00:09,623
have been reversed?

1384
02:00:10,305 --> 02:01:10,454
