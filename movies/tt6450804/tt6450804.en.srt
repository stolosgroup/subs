<i>It's like
a giant strobe light...</i>

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,981
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,488
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,059
<i>Children look like
burnt paper...</i>

6
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:28,328
<i>black...</i>

7
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,697
<i>not moving.</i>

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,768
<i>And then
the blast wave hits them.</i>

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,076
<i>And they fly apart
like leaves.</i>

10
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,045
<i>Dreams of the end of the world</i>

11
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,114
<i>are very common.</i>

12
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:53,888
<i>It's not a dream,
you moron. It's real.</i>

13
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,822
<i>I know the date it happens.</i>

14
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,225
<i>I'm sure
it feels very real to you.</i>

15
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,626
<i>On August 29th, 1997,</i>

16
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:05,164
<i>it's gonna feel pretty fuckin'
real to you, too!</i>

17
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:09,467
<i>Anybody not wearing two million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

18
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,070
- <i>Get it?</i>
- <i>Sarah...</i>

19
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:14,139
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive?</i>

20
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,308
<i>You're already dead.
Everybody.</i>

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,911
<i>Him, you!
You're dead already!</i>

22
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,814
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

23
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,515
<i>You're the one
living in a fucking dream!</i>

24
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,621
<i>'Cause I know it happened!
It happened!</i>

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,364
<i>There once was a future</i>

26
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,334
<i>in which humankind
was hunted...</i>

27
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,337
<i>by a machine
that could think...</i>

28
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,540
<i>and Terminators built to kill.</i>

29
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,578
<i>A future without hope.</i>

30
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,675
<i>That future never
happened because I stopped it...</i>

31
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,548
... <i>to protect my son...</i>

32
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,219
<i>and to save us all.</i>

33
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,039
No!

34
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:27,406
No!

35
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,735
No.

36
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,836
No!

37
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:01,242
<i>Once I saved
three billion lives...</i>

38
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:02,808
John!

39
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,877
<i>...but I couldn't save my son.</i>

40
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,311
John!

41
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,883
<i>A machine took him from me.</i>

42
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,888
<i>And I am terminated.</i>

43
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,141
Are you okay?

44
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,866
Okay, okay, okay.

45
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:15,801
Thanks, lady.

46
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,938
You just saved our asses.

47
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,788
Don't thank me yet.

48
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,716
Hey, little brother.
Good morning.

49
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,685
I brought tamales and atole.

50
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:49,861
Well, if you want to
be big in America, you would say...?

51
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,468
I'm going to
pass Bruno Mars...

52
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,803
pronto?

53
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:58,005
Good.

54
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,075
- Let's go.
- Okay.

55
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:09,183
Uh-huh.

56
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,034
Let's go, Diego.
We're running late.

57
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,636
- I had something going there.
- Yeah.

58
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,204
- I saw it.
- Come on.

59
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,939
You think I was
flirting with her too much?

60
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,976
I think all the parts where
you were talking were too much.

61
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,347
Funny.

62
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:44,871
Dani?

63
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:46,173
Mmm-hmm.

64
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,626
Hey, hey, hey!

65
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,736
There's a new guy
at my station.

66
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:18,305
I see that.

67
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,806
Robot.

68
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,380
<i>Senor</i> Sanchez,
what's going on?

69
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,085
Diego...

70
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,186
<i>Si.</i>

71
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,155
I'll go.

72
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,791
- Take my spot.
- No, no, no.

73
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,536
Dani Ramos.

74
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,177
How's the game?

75
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:23,002
Please, Mr. Grummond.
It's my brother.

76
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:25,372
But, Dani,
he ain't you.

77
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,208
What's next?

78
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:30,977
3,000 people out there.

79
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:32,277
What happens if I tell them

80
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,548
they're just keeping a
spot warm for some machine?

81
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,482
That is not your father.

82
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,986
That is a machine that was
sent here to kill you.

83
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:49,055
- Let me go!
- You come with me

84
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:51,456
or you're dead
in the next 30 seconds.

85
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,424
Come on.

86
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:07,305
Who are you?

87
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,943
I'm the person
saving your life.

88
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,666
Dani!

89
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,430
Go, Dani.

90
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,768
Stay behind me!

91
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,829
Hey, lady!

92
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,135
Grace.

93
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,739
My name is Grace.

94
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,372
That won't kill it.

95
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,874
- We gotta go. Move!
- What?

96
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:49,911
- Go!
- Diego!

97
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:53,813
To where?

98
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:55,315
Keep going!

99
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:58,820
Come on!

100
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:01,755
Here. This way.

101
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,560
Come on!

102
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:07,995
Hey!

103
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:09,360
Please!

104
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,063
Can you tell us
what that thing is?

105
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:13,032
It's a Terminator. A Rev-9.

106
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:15,069
He was sent here
from the future. I was, too.

107
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:16,902
Get in.

108
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:17,970
Get in!

109
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:25,978
Are you a machine, too?

110
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,246
No, I'm human like you.

111
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:29,281
But, uh, your arm...

112
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:31,516
I'm augmented.

113
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:32,954
- What?
- Augmented?

114
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:42,928
Fuck! Shit!

115
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,937
Oh, shit.

116
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:54,809
No!

117
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:05,552
Faster! Go faster!

118
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:25,472
I know you're scared,
but I am here to protect you.

119
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:27,108
Why us?

120
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,211
You, Dani.
You're my mission.

121
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:33,413
Me?

122
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:36,483
No, no, no!

123
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:49,997
Look out!

124
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:24,832
Go faster! Go faster!

125
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,063
Fuck!

126
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:05,206
No! No!

127
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:09,642
Oh, my God!

128
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,780
No!

129
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:16,482
Drive!

130
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:18,549
- What?
- Can you drive?

131
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,518
- No, I mean, I can't...
- I can! I can!

132
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,788
Yeah.

133
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,792
Hold it. Grace...

134
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,528
Dani, put your seat belt on.

135
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:17,702
Diego...

136
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,278
Grace! Help me!

137
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,714
It's Diego!

138
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,116
Please! Take him out.

139
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,119
Dani.

140
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:34,486
I can't.

141
00:22:34,488 --> 00:22:36,321
What? No, no!

142
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:38,323
Don't. He will bleed out.

143
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,035
<i>Senor?</i>

144
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,439
Diego.

145
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,178
- Dani, we have to go.
- I'm not leaving him.

146
00:22:58,245 --> 00:22:59,914
Take her. Save her.

147
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,949
- No!
- I'm sorry.

148
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:04,952
Please!

149
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:21,366
No.

150
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:22,834
- Diego!
- Dani!

151
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,706
Dani! Dani, stop!

152
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,108
Why did you do that?

153
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,178
We have to go,
or he died for nothing.

154
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,481
- No.
- Come on.

155
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:36,283
Diego!

156
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,390
Oh, shit.

157
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,865
When they start
to kill me, run.

158
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,135
What?

159
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,747
I'll be back.

160
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:25,159
Who the fuck is that?

161
00:25:26,427 --> 00:25:27,428
I don't know.

162
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:29,863
But we have to move.

163
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:33,598
Go.

164
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,835
We can't just...

165
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:36,935
Grace, it's that lady's car.

166
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,437
Dani, you go
or it kills you.

167
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:39,573
It's that simple.

168
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,383
Son of a bitch!

169
00:25:56,523 --> 00:25:57,524
Dani...

170
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:00,394
I need some water.

171
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:04,365
If we can
maybe look in the back.

172
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,136
I wanna go home.

173
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:10,637
Take me home.

174
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:12,873
We're not doing that.

175
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,243
I have to tell my father
about Diego.

176
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:17,943
It's not possible.

177
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:19,644
He doesn't know
about Diego.

178
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,079
I need to see my father!

179
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,549
Your father is dead.

180
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:25,552
What?

181
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:29,356
It needs physical contact
to copy people.

182
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,159
And they don't survive.

183
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:35,362
No.

184
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:37,896
No.

185
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:00,988
What's wrong with you?

186
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,991
I'm crashing.

187
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,561
You're burning up.

188
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:13,400
My metabolism was tuned
for short, intense bursts.

189
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:18,038
You either stop a Terminator
in the first few minutes...

190
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,674
or you're dead.

191
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:25,279
I need meds.

192
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:31,185
Hey!

193
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,318
Grace!

194
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,321
Wake up!

195
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:53,707
Where are you going?

196
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,343
Get back in the car.

197
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:00,481
I have to protect you.

198
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,685
You can't even walk.

199
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:07,354
I'm going to the police.

200
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:12,224
You do that,
it'll find you.

201
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:15,629
You put a hundred cops between
you and a Terminator...

202
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,266
you'll get
a hundred dead cops.

203
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:24,605
Dani, please.

204
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:40,552
Wait. Come here.

205
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:43,423
- You said you can't drive.
- Yeah.

206
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,425
I'll figure it out.

207
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:08,382
Hey!

208
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:11,884
Hey!

209
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:13,184
Grace, Grace!

210
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,355
It's okay. We're here.

211
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,424
Fuck, you're heavy.

212
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:22,529
We're here.

213
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:28,168
Grace.

214
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:43,348
I need any anticonvulsant.

215
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:47,421
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate,
insulin, benzodiazepine...

216
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:50,457
Do you have
a doctor's prescription?

217
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,960
Here's my prescription.

218
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:55,228
What are you doing?

219
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,231
Fuck it.

220
00:29:58,699 --> 00:29:59,700
Move.

221
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,786
It's okay.

222
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:22,824
Grace.

223
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:25,659
Grace.

224
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:27,794
Grace?

225
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,611
Grace.

226
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:05,232
I save your ass...

227
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,169
and you steal my truck.
Nice.

228
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:10,905
I...

229
00:31:12,907 --> 00:31:14,876
Never mind. It's burnt.

230
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:17,310
What's wrong with her?

231
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,444
I don't know.

232
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:22,114
She's sick or something.

233
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:23,918
Well, I need answers
from you two.

234
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:26,219
So let's get her in the car.

235
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:29,523
Give me that
before you hurt yourself.

236
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:40,802
So, who are you?

237
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,272
Um, Daniella Ramos.

238
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:47,774
Dani.

239
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:50,775
I'm nobody.

240
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:54,548
Well, Dani, you must be somebody,
or they wouldn't have sent...

241
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,852
whatever she is
to protect you.

242
00:32:00,387 --> 00:32:02,456
Hey, you got a phone?

243
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,660
- Yes.
- Could I see it for a sec?

244
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:13,331
Hey!

245
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,904
Might as well be
wearing a tracking bracelet.

246
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:19,805
When I'm ready
to kill that thing,

247
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,775
then I'll let it know
where we are.

248
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:31,018
We should have done this
in the bathtub.

249
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:33,855
Have you seen the bathtub?

250
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:41,659
Uh-uh.

251
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:44,196
I keep my cell phone
in the chip bag.

252
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:47,099
The foil blocks
the GPS signal

253
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:48,535
so they can't track me.

254
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:51,538
Who's trying to track you?

255
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,574
I'm wanted
in a couple of states.

256
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:56,978
50, actually.

257
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,348
But why 10 bags?

258
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:04,651
Because I really like
potato chips.

259
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,660
Her meds...

260
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,931
how do you know
how much of each to use?

261
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:19,432
I don't.

262
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:42,589
No one will know
who he is.

263
00:33:43,757 --> 00:33:44,758
Who?

264
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:51,933
My brother.

265
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,634
He was in the truck when...

266
00:34:03,277 --> 00:34:05,079
Who will be there
to bury him?

267
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:09,416
Or my father?

268
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,021
No funerals.

269
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:17,825
No one there to say goodbye.

270
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:22,729
Funerals don't help them.

271
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:27,800
And goodbyes don't help you.

272
00:34:27,802 --> 00:34:30,470
You just have to learn
to live with it.

273
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:35,773
<i>Come in, base.</i>

274
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:39,013
<i>This is Dragonfly Three
requesting close air support.</i>

275
00:34:39,646 --> 00:34:40,980
We are five klicks out,

276
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:44,049
carrying wounded
precious cargo. Over.

277
00:34:44,051 --> 00:34:46,451
<i>Roger that, Dragonfly Three.</i>

278
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:49,522
<i>Be advised there are hostiles
inbound on vector five.</i>

279
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,495
The trauma crew is standing by for
the commander at the south tunnel.

280
00:34:57,497 --> 00:35:00,533
We have Rev-7s in pursuit.
Weapons free.

281
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:22,888
Let's move!

282
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,658
We got 30 seconds.

283
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:28,996
- Get off there now! Move back!
- Go!

284
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:33,134
Incoming!

285
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:57,022
You get
the commander inside.

286
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:58,891
Okay.

287
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:01,561
You three, with me!
Hold them back!

288
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:05,699
Come on!

289
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:09,502
Look out!

290
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:38,265
We're being overrun!
We need reinforcements now!

291
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:44,205
Cover her!

292
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,912
Move! Coming in!

293
00:36:52,413 --> 00:36:53,544
Shit!

294
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:55,447
She's got multiple
stab wounds.

295
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:56,815
A lot of chest trauma here.

296
00:36:56,817 --> 00:36:58,484
Let's get these
holes sealed up.

297
00:36:58,486 --> 00:36:59,650
Get a chest tube
in the right side.

298
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:00,953
This is gonna hurt
like a motherfucker.

299
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:02,021
Wait, wait.

300
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:03,057
No!

301
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:07,226
- Here.
- No, no!

302
00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:09,761
I need to protect
your commander.

303
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:11,096
The commander is safe,
thanks to you.

304
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,200
Don't worry, soldier.
You'll make it.

305
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:15,234
I volunteer.

306
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:16,703
Make me an Augment.

307
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,845
Midline sternotomy
with manubrial splitting.

308
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:29,950
Lung deflation
and cardiac localization.

309
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:33,318
Okay, let's gear up.

310
00:37:34,654 --> 00:37:35,954
Sarah?

311
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:36,957
Talk.

312
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:39,860
Talk fast.

313
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:44,331
You first.

314
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:48,766
Get off me.

315
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:54,707
Sarah!

316
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:02,950
Hey, Sarah!
Open the door.

317
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:05,853
Dani!

318
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,120
- You okay?
- Yeah, you okay?

319
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:09,488
Yeah.

320
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,690
What happened?

321
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:13,591
Locked me
out of the room?

322
00:38:13,593 --> 00:38:17,965
Sometimes mommies and daddies
have to have grown-up discussions.

323
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:23,270
So you're here
to protect her.

324
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:26,505
What are you?

325
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:28,309
Never seen one
like you before.

326
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:30,675
Almost human.

327
00:38:30,677 --> 00:38:32,113
I am human.

328
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,313
Just enhanced.

329
00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:36,614
You know,
increased speed and strength,

330
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:38,117
thorium micro-reactor.

331
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,818
Which means I can
rip your throat out

332
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,589
if you piss me off,
so don't.

333
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:45,025
When are you from?

334
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,894
2042.

335
00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:48,863
Your turn.

336
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,948
My name is Sarah Connor.

337
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,649
When I was about her age...

338
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:14,553
a Terminator
was sent to kill me...

339
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:16,824
to stop the birth
of my son, John.

340
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:19,659
Leader of the Resistance.

341
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:21,692
Which resistance?

342
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:23,864
The human resistance.

343
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:25,933
Against Skynet?

344
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:30,735
The AI that's trying
to wipe us all out?

345
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:32,306
I've never heard of it.

346
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:35,176
Good.

347
00:39:35,943 --> 00:39:37,677
John and I changed that.

348
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:39,980
We changed the future.

349
00:39:40,648 --> 00:39:42,749
Saved three billion lives.

350
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:48,088
You're welcome.

351
00:39:51,392 --> 00:39:52,826
Where's your son now?

352
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:04,405
Skynet had sent several
Terminators to hunt him.

353
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:09,810
One finally caught up
with us...

354
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:17,784
and carried out orders from
a future that never happened.

355
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:22,056
Since then...

356
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:25,426
I hunt Terminators.

357
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:31,065
And I drink till I black out.

358
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:34,001
Enough of a resume for you?

359
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,936
No.

360
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,205
How did you know
we'd be on that freeway?

361
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:42,742
Interview's over.
We gotta move.

362
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:44,478
We?

363
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:46,744
There is no "we."

364
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:49,414
Dani's with me.
It's my mission to protect her.

365
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,482
Oh, yeah?

366
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:52,186
How's that working out
for you?

367
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:57,089
Clearly you don't know
everything about this time.

368
00:40:57,091 --> 00:41:00,959
How anyone with a phone
is a walking sensor platform.

369
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:03,629
How every intersection,
every gas station

370
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:05,697
and 7-Eleven has cameras.

371
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:07,065
Nobody walks
through this world

372
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:09,334
without leaving a digital
trail a mile wide.

373
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:12,838
And my guess is that
Terminator hunting her...

374
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,242
can access that data
anytime.

375
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:23,350
You two won't last 10 hours.

376
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:39,831
Let's get
something straight.

377
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,934
If you put her in danger
or you get in my way,

378
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:45,005
I will fuck you up.

379
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,441
Right.

380
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,376
I drive.

381
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,181
So, that machine...

382
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:56,050
who sent it?

383
00:41:58,018 --> 00:41:59,718
I can't fight it
if I don't know

384
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,155
what we're up against.

385
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,490
It's a Rev-9 model.

386
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:06,391
You don't fight it.

387
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:07,859
You run from it.

388
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,430
Yeah, but who sent it?

389
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,165
Not who.

390
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:14,001
What. And it wasn't some...

391
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,301
Skynet thing.

392
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:18,572
In the future
that actually happened...

393
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,407
it's called Legion.

394
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:21,808
Legion.

395
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,042
An AI built
for cyber warfare.

396
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:27,612
Those assholes
never learn.

397
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:29,081
And it attacked.

398
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,918
- Attacked who?
- Us.

399
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:33,487
Everybody. Humanity.

400
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:41,362
Sarah, how did you know
we would be on that bridge?

401
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:48,133
I get these texts.

402
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:51,703
Precise GPS coordinates,
dates, times,

403
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:53,305
down to the second.

404
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:55,943
They always end
with the same two words.

405
00:42:57,812 --> 00:42:59,846
"For John."

406
00:42:59,848 --> 00:43:02,581
So I pack up
every weapon I've got,

407
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,149
and I head
to those coordinates

408
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:07,119
to kill whoever
is messing with me.

409
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:10,188
The air splits open
above a parking lot

410
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,093
and a Terminator drops out.

411
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:16,829
So I destroy it.

412
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:19,664
And then two years later,
same thing.

413
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:23,535
Location, time, date,
"For John."

414
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,038
I frag that one, too.

415
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:29,141
And last week,
I get two texts,

416
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:31,076
both in Mexico City.

417
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:33,378
Did you ever find out
who sends those texts?

418
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,816
No. They're
always encrypted.

419
00:43:36,818 --> 00:43:38,485
Do you still have them
on your phone?

420
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:40,320
Dani.

421
00:43:49,596 --> 00:43:50,662
What are you doing?

422
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:52,032
Future shit.

423
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:58,570
What's wrong? What is it?

424
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:01,542
These texts
came from outside Laredo.

425
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,043
Two days ago,

426
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:08,079
my commander had them tattoo
these coordinates on me.

427
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:09,614
As if I couldn't
remember shit.

428
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:10,917
Told me to go here in case

429
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:12,486
anything went sideways
with my mission.

430
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:16,490
It's the same location
your texts come from.

431
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:20,125
Whoever sent you these texts
is the same person

432
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:21,728
I was told to go to for help.

433
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,763
What does it mean?

434
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:26,567
It means
we're going to Texas.

435
00:44:27,936 --> 00:44:29,768
You wanna cross
the U.S. border

436
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,237
with an undocumented
Mexican national

437
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,539
and a woman who had
her own episode

438
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,541
on <i>America's Most Wanted?</i>

439
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:38,612
I know someone
who can get us across.

440
00:44:40,915 --> 00:44:42,115
Someone you trust?

441
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,751
Yes. My uncle.

442
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:47,588
Well, we need
to ditch the car.

443
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:49,590
Get off the grid.

444
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:17,351
Why do you care
what happens to her?

445
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:19,720
Hey, ladies.

446
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:24,891
Because I was her.

447
00:45:24,893 --> 00:45:26,591
And it sucks.

448
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:28,161
Let's go.

449
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:41,341
Well, this is
off the grid, all right.

450
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:45,176
But I wish it wasn't
so crowded here.

451
00:45:45,178 --> 00:45:47,447
Well, I wish you two
weren't so white.

452
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:56,590
Let's go, <i>chicas.</i>

453
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:13,707
<i>Gracias.</i>

454
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,837
Grace,
tell me what happens

455
00:47:17,237 --> 00:47:19,139
when this all falls apart.

456
00:47:23,276 --> 00:47:24,678
Nothing happens.

457
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:28,981
There's no warning.

458
00:47:28,983 --> 00:47:30,852
Day one,
everything just stops.

459
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:34,788
No phones, no power.
Cities go dark.

460
00:47:36,024 --> 00:47:37,658
Grace, stay there.

461
00:47:38,826 --> 00:47:40,193
<i>They told us</i>

462
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:42,830
<i>we had to leave,</i>

463
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:46,667
<i>just until things
got back to normal.</i>

464
00:48:02,616 --> 00:48:05,252
But normal
was never coming back.

465
00:48:08,522 --> 00:48:10,056
Day two,

466
00:48:10,058 --> 00:48:11,523
they launched nukes.

467
00:48:11,525 --> 00:48:13,458
They thought they could
contain Legion

468
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,930
with tactical EMP strikes.

469
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,937
And by day three,
the whole world was at war.

470
00:48:27,175 --> 00:48:28,608
Millions died.

471
00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:32,477
And then,
when the food ran out,

472
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:33,480
billions.

473
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:42,355
Some men killed my dad
over a can of peaches.

474
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,691
I'm sorry.

475
00:48:46,693 --> 00:48:48,293
When we thought
the worst was over,

476
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:51,531
then Legion started
to hunt survivors.

477
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,171
We know
you got food, kid.

478
00:49:32,173 --> 00:49:33,373
Give it up.

479
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:47,153
I don't know how I made it
through the next few years.

480
00:49:47,155 --> 00:49:48,990
I just try
not to think about it.

481
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:52,359
But I got lucky.

482
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,427
Someone found me,

483
00:49:56,797 --> 00:49:57,965
saved me,

484
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:03,836
and then we started
fighting back.

485
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:05,305
And let me guess.

486
00:50:07,507 --> 00:50:11,578
Dani gives birth to the
one man that can stop it.

487
00:50:14,447 --> 00:50:17,149
- What?
- The future wants you dead

488
00:50:17,151 --> 00:50:20,052
for the same reason
it wanted me dead.

489
00:50:20,054 --> 00:50:22,254
But I'm nothing.
I'm nobody.

490
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:23,891
Yeah, you're
not the threat.

491
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:28,495
It's your womb.

492
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,868
Fine.
Let someone else be

493
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,704
Mother Mary for a while.

494
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:39,839
If you're Mother Mary,

495
00:50:39,841 --> 00:50:41,976
why do I so wanna
beat the shit outta you?

496
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,611
Dani!

497
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:06,193
My clients
get across safely.

498
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:08,626
To a better life.

499
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:10,930
I don't leave them
to die in the desert

500
00:52:10,932 --> 00:52:11,864
as some others do.

501
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:14,601
Can you get us
across the border?

502
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:20,540
Forgive me, but gringas
are not my usual clientele.

503
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,980
You two do something
illegal maybe?

504
00:52:27,982 --> 00:52:30,583
Something my Dani
doesn't wish to say?

505
00:52:31,484 --> 00:52:33,453
<i>Tio,</i> there's...

506
00:52:35,256 --> 00:52:36,857
This is going to sound crazy,

507
00:52:37,757 --> 00:52:39,959
but there's a machine
out there.

508
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:41,526
A robot.

509
00:52:41,528 --> 00:52:43,262
It's what killed
<i>Papi</i> and Diego,

510
00:52:43,264 --> 00:52:44,631
and it wants to kill me.

511
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:46,566
We have to get away from it.

512
00:52:47,168 --> 00:52:48,468
That's a new one.

513
00:52:58,678 --> 00:53:00,580
Grace is part machine, too.

514
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:23,770
This way, ladies.

515
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:35,114
Hey, fellas.

516
00:53:35,116 --> 00:53:36,150
What's up?

517
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,056
Ain't that just
like the Border Patrol.

518
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:47,059
Five minutes late,
and neglects to bring us donuts.

519
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:49,395
Terrance, shut the fuck up.

520
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:13,018
<i>Griffin 33 in contact</i>

521
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,688
<i>with intersection
due west of the Greene Bridge.</i>

522
00:54:16,689 --> 00:54:18,792
<i>9-11 Griffin 33 wilco.</i>

523
00:54:20,294 --> 00:54:23,064
<i>Griffin 33 9-11,
that is your target.</i>

524
00:54:39,646 --> 00:54:40,848
Almost there.

525
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,315
One more kilometer
to the river.

526
00:54:43,317 --> 00:54:44,318
Wait.

527
00:54:47,021 --> 00:54:48,055
Take cover.

528
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:52,359
There's a drone up there.

529
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:55,360
I don't hear anything.

530
00:54:55,362 --> 00:54:57,329
Yeah, well, you're not
an augmented super soldier

531
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:58,598
from the future,
are you?

532
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:01,235
We have to hurry.

533
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:04,702
Attention, all patrols.

534
00:55:04,704 --> 00:55:07,106
Be advised,
new coordinates issued.

535
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:09,707
<i>Suspects are now
220 meters south</i>

536
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:11,977
<i>of Checkpoint 7-Bravo.</i>

537
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:15,180
<i>They are known members
of the Sinaloa Cartel.</i>

538
00:55:15,182 --> 00:55:19,384
<i>Wanted by American
and Mexican authorities.</i>

539
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:23,023
<i>They should be considered armed and dangerous.</i>

540
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:25,692
Deadly force is authorized.

541
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:32,763
When you reach the wall,

542
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:34,632
there's a door beneath.

543
00:55:34,634 --> 00:55:36,070
Flacco will
show you the way.

544
00:55:53,053 --> 00:55:54,321
I will go first.

545
00:56:07,234 --> 00:56:08,235
Oh, shit.

546
00:56:09,336 --> 00:56:12,471
<i>Stop! U.S. Border Patrol.</i>

547
00:56:12,473 --> 00:56:14,375
<i>Put your weapons
on the ground.</i>

548
00:56:15,742 --> 00:56:18,345
We get locked up,
it comes for her, she's dead.

549
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,580
<i>I'm not gonna
tell you again!</i>

550
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:23,184
<i>Put them on the ground!</i>

551
00:56:24,385 --> 00:56:25,617
Okay.

552
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,085
Dani! Dani!

553
00:56:27,087 --> 00:56:29,890
They can shoot me,
but I'm not watching you die.

554
00:56:32,092 --> 00:56:33,325
It's okay.

555
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:34,328
It's okay.

556
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:38,964
If they
separate me from her,

557
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:42,434
- please get her out of there.
- All right.

558
00:56:42,436 --> 00:56:45,372
<i>Walk forward
and away from your weapons.</i>

559
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:51,744
<i>Get on the ground!</i>

560
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:06,158
Get up, move it.

561
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,828
- You get them?
- Yep.

562
00:57:19,974 --> 00:57:21,739
<i>We have one male suspect</i>

563
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:23,844
<i>and three female suspects
in custody.</i>

564
00:57:28,716 --> 00:57:30,017
- Dani!
- Hey!

565
00:57:44,064 --> 00:57:45,299
We need help here!

566
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:05,550
Sorry, but I don't
have time for this shit.

567
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:07,319
And it's not my problem.

568
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:09,054
I need basic information.

569
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:11,857
Name, age, country of origin.

570
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:15,460
It's the truth, ma'am.
I swear it.

571
00:58:15,462 --> 00:58:19,031
This machine, it killed
my brother and my father,

572
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:20,399
and now it wants to kill me,

573
00:58:20,401 --> 00:58:21,933
- and he...
- Uh-huh.

574
00:58:21,935 --> 00:58:25,005
Please! Officer,
you have to believe me.

575
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:26,874
You're in danger, too.

576
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:29,510
No. I'm in Processing.

577
00:58:30,244 --> 00:58:31,310
You ought to
save your story

578
00:58:31,312 --> 00:58:33,447
till you get where
you're going, honey.

579
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:37,251
Heart rate
slightly elevated.

580
00:58:39,053 --> 00:58:41,455
Lungs are clear.
Let's get that wound exposed.

581
00:58:42,823 --> 00:58:44,224
Trachea's midline.

582
00:58:45,225 --> 00:58:46,927
Let's check
for any exit wounds.

583
00:58:55,169 --> 00:58:57,037
Nice body search, fellas.

584
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:09,016
What is that?

585
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:11,952
I've never seen
anything like this.

586
00:59:12,686 --> 00:59:15,487
Let's get some pictures.

587
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:17,925
<i>That's confirmed.
We have eyes on it now. Go ahead.</i>

588
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,425
Hey.

589
00:59:20,427 --> 00:59:23,695
I just got TDY'd here
to pick up a new detainee.

590
00:59:23,697 --> 00:59:24,863
Where they being held?

591
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:26,631
Check in
with the desk sergeant.

592
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:29,069
- He'll direct you.
- Thank you.

593
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:53,792
Evenin'.

594
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:56,495
Supposed to pick up
a detainee. Dani Ramos.

595
00:59:56,497 --> 00:59:57,598
Please locker your weapon.

596
01:00:05,874 --> 01:00:07,441
What's been done to her?

597
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:10,644
How is she even alive
with all this stuff in her?

598
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:15,815
Expect a big ping, brother.

599
01:00:15,817 --> 01:00:17,215
My whole body's a weapon.

600
01:00:17,217 --> 01:00:19,153
Save it for the ladies.

601
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:22,855
Sorry. Metal hip.

602
01:00:22,857 --> 01:00:24,324
Two tours in Afghanistan.

603
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:27,961
All right. Thank you
for your service.

604
01:00:31,698 --> 01:00:32,699
Psst.

605
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:37,938
Connor.

606
01:00:39,808 --> 01:00:41,508
Sarah Connor.

607
01:00:42,911 --> 01:00:44,545
I'm Officer Rigby.

608
01:00:45,546 --> 01:00:46,980
It's an honor.

609
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:54,154
Hey, guess what.

610
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:56,455
You're famous.

611
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:58,659
And we don't get a lot
of famous around here.

612
01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:01,793
Let's go.

613
01:01:01,795 --> 01:01:03,997
You belong
in your own private cage.

614
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:07,468
I want to go, too!

615
01:01:33,794 --> 01:01:35,128
Hey! Catch her!

616
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:48,175
Did I say you can
look at my private parts?

617
01:01:50,879 --> 01:01:52,244
Where do they take
the new prisoners?

618
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:54,281
They're called detainees
and we...

619
01:01:55,716 --> 01:01:59,251
They're taken to the south end
holding area for processing...

620
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:01,288
Thanks.

621
01:02:40,561 --> 01:02:41,660
Right this way, ma'am.

622
01:02:41,662 --> 01:02:44,629
Our senior living section
is on the second floor.

623
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:49,167
Hey!

624
01:03:21,702 --> 01:03:23,136
Grace! Grace!

625
01:03:24,072 --> 01:03:26,106
- You okay?
- He's here. We gotta go.

626
01:03:27,075 --> 01:03:29,274
Get back!
Everybody, get back!

627
01:04:01,608 --> 01:04:02,609
Come on.

628
01:04:10,183 --> 01:04:11,385
Get in!

629
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:18,358
We gotta go.

630
01:04:20,862 --> 01:04:22,360
There's Sarah.
She's coming.

631
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:25,799
- There's no time.
- What?

632
01:04:28,735 --> 01:04:30,370
No! I'm not leaving her!

633
01:04:31,738 --> 01:04:32,739
Dani!

634
01:04:37,678 --> 01:04:39,277
Sarah, run!

635
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:40,913
- Sarah, get her!
- Get in!

636
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,041
Dani, you need
to understand something.

637
01:05:09,043 --> 01:05:10,878
You can't do stupid shit
like that.

638
01:05:11,678 --> 01:05:14,180
You cannot put yourself
at risk.

639
01:05:14,182 --> 01:05:16,781
- He would have killed Sarah.
- That doesn't matter!

640
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:18,750
When are you gonna get it?

641
01:05:18,752 --> 01:05:22,422
Everybody dies
if you don't make it.

642
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,665
She's right.

643
01:05:32,566 --> 01:05:33,767
What?

644
01:05:39,372 --> 01:05:41,339
Hey there, fellas.

645
01:05:41,341 --> 01:05:43,075
Y'all come
to see the shitshow?

646
01:05:43,077 --> 01:05:44,676
What the hell
happened here?

647
01:05:44,678 --> 01:05:47,113
Detainee got loose,
unlocked all the cages,

648
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:48,682
just chaos from there.

649
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:51,083
I don't mind tellin' you,

650
01:05:51,085 --> 01:05:53,653
I prayed more in five minutes
than I have my whole life.

651
01:05:54,122 --> 01:05:56,021
Heard that.

652
01:05:56,023 --> 01:05:59,894
Say, you boys know where I can
get my hands on a chopper?

653
01:06:07,935 --> 01:06:09,436
We're over the coordinates.

654
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:12,773
Land
a klick short.

655
01:06:37,265 --> 01:06:39,599
So, Carl? That's the plan?

656
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:42,569
Carl's the mystery texter.

657
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:10,097
<i>No!</i>

658
01:07:10,965 --> 01:07:12,399
<i>No!</i>

659
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:15,870
Sarah Connor.

660
01:07:17,004 --> 01:07:18,403
Sarah!

661
01:07:18,405 --> 01:07:21,040
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

662
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:22,875
What the fuck are you doing?

663
01:07:22,877 --> 01:07:24,143
- Let me have it!
- No.

664
01:07:24,145 --> 01:07:26,312
Sarah, you need
to calm down.

665
01:07:26,314 --> 01:07:28,115
That thing killed John!

666
01:07:30,251 --> 01:07:32,019
- Is that true?
- Yes.

667
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:34,452
But I'm not
what you think I am.

668
01:07:34,454 --> 01:07:36,856
I'll kill you,
you motherfucker!

669
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:37,789
Sarah, Sarah.

670
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,992
- If this man can help us...
- Not a man.

671
01:07:39,994 --> 01:07:41,861
A Terminator.

672
01:07:41,863 --> 01:07:44,395
Shoot him in the face
and see what's underneath!

673
01:07:44,397 --> 01:07:45,900
I don't care what he is!

674
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:48,903
Please.

675
01:08:07,255 --> 01:08:09,054
- So you're a...
- Yes.

676
01:08:09,056 --> 01:08:11,092
Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.

677
01:08:12,626 --> 01:08:13,793
May I ask what you are?

678
01:08:14,962 --> 01:08:15,963
No.

679
01:08:36,384 --> 01:08:37,617
Sarah?

680
01:08:51,966 --> 01:08:55,136
I don't have
a photograph of John.

681
01:09:00,341 --> 01:09:02,143
I never took any.

682
01:09:07,081 --> 01:09:08,715
I thought that...

683
01:09:13,387 --> 01:09:14,855
they couldn't find him...

684
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:19,492
if they didn't know
what he looked like.

685
01:09:21,929 --> 01:09:24,597
But now I'm forgetting
his face.

686
01:09:28,169 --> 01:09:29,569
I'm sorry.

687
01:09:35,508 --> 01:09:37,011
So why
is the girl targeted?

688
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:40,145
You don't need to know.

689
01:09:40,147 --> 01:09:42,482
Well, can you at least
tell me how you found me?

690
01:09:50,224 --> 01:09:51,258
Who gave you that?

691
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:10,710
Thanks.

692
01:10:20,687 --> 01:10:22,890
- Please sit down.
- Cut the shit.

693
01:10:30,498 --> 01:10:32,331
Nice family.

694
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:34,201
She a Terminator, too?

695
01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:39,006
That's your
little Terminator kid?

696
01:10:39,507 --> 01:10:40,941
His name is Mateo.

697
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:42,975
I met his mother, Alicia,

698
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:45,310
a few months
after I killed John.

699
01:10:45,312 --> 01:10:47,281
Oh, you don't get
to say his name.

700
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:49,649
Ever.

701
01:10:53,553 --> 01:10:55,454
Her husband
had beaten her.

702
01:10:55,456 --> 01:10:56,957
He was trying
to kill her child.

703
01:10:57,491 --> 01:10:58,959
She had nowhere to go.

704
01:11:00,394 --> 01:11:02,961
Caring for this family
gave me purpose.

705
01:11:02,963 --> 01:11:04,997
'Cause without purpose,
we are nothing.

706
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:08,102
Touching story.
Does it have a point?

707
01:11:08,869 --> 01:11:11,338
While raising Mateo,
my son,

708
01:11:12,605 --> 01:11:14,840
I began to understand
what I had taken from you.

709
01:11:14,842 --> 01:11:17,278
Wait. You grew a conscience?

710
01:11:18,879 --> 01:11:21,046
The equivalent of one, yes.

711
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:22,749
It's an infiltrator.

712
01:11:23,117 --> 01:11:24,483
It's lying.

713
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:27,986
When my mission was completed,
there were no further orders.

714
01:11:27,988 --> 01:11:30,621
So for 20 years,
I kept learning

715
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:31,926
how to become more human.

716
01:11:33,461 --> 01:11:34,893
So what about the texts?

717
01:11:34,895 --> 01:11:37,329
When chronal
displacement occurs

718
01:11:37,331 --> 01:11:38,796
there's a shockwave
through time

719
01:11:38,798 --> 01:11:40,399
measurable before the event.

720
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:43,202
That's how, not why.

721
01:11:43,204 --> 01:11:45,337
To give you purpose, Sarah.

722
01:11:45,339 --> 01:11:47,840
I thought it would bring
meaning to your son's death.

723
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:57,617
You know what would
give meaning to his death?

724
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,354
No, Sarah!

725
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,327
This will be very hard
to explain to Alicia.

726
01:12:08,329 --> 01:12:10,429
It's a Terminator!

727
01:12:10,431 --> 01:12:12,464
And we are fighting
a Terminator.

728
01:12:12,466 --> 01:12:14,335
One that we can't stop.

729
01:12:18,038 --> 01:12:20,638
Do you believe
in fate, Sarah?

730
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,808
Or do you believe that we all
can change the future

731
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:25,045
every second by every
choice that we make?

732
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:28,949
You chose
to change the future.

733
01:12:30,783 --> 01:12:33,254
You chose
to destroy Skynet.

734
01:12:34,388 --> 01:12:35,923
You set me free.

735
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:39,790
And now,

736
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:42,029
I'm going to help you
protect the girl

737
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:44,899
because I choose to.

738
01:12:51,505 --> 01:12:53,472
That's Alicia.

739
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:55,209
She needs my help
with the groceries.

740
01:13:02,082 --> 01:13:04,149
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

741
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:05,651
We have company.

742
01:13:05,653 --> 01:13:07,121
Company? Who?

743
01:13:15,795 --> 01:13:17,398
Was there enough
hot water?

744
01:13:18,499 --> 01:13:20,067
- Yes, thank you.
- Thanks.

745
01:13:21,268 --> 01:13:22,369
Here you go.

746
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:28,142
Carl, your friends
look hungry.

747
01:13:29,009 --> 01:13:30,708
Would you like
some sandwiches

748
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,144
and chips or something?

749
01:13:32,146 --> 01:13:34,215
That's
a great idea, Alicia.

750
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:40,785
Mateo, why don't you go
and help your mother?

751
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:42,456
Sure, Dad.
I'm on it.

752
01:13:49,363 --> 01:13:50,831
So, you're Carl.

753
01:13:51,999 --> 01:13:53,799
That's what everyone
calls me, yes.

754
01:13:53,801 --> 01:13:56,337
I'm never gonna
fucking call you Carl.

755
01:14:00,574 --> 01:14:01,976
They don't know?

756
01:14:04,878 --> 01:14:06,378
- No.
- She hasn't noticed that

757
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,614
you weigh 400 pounds?

758
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:10,082
That you never sleep?

759
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:12,150
Our relationship
is not physical.

760
01:14:12,152 --> 01:14:14,353
She appreciated that I
could change diapers.

761
01:14:14,355 --> 01:14:17,022
Efficiently and
without any complaints.

762
01:14:17,024 --> 01:14:20,294
I am reliable,
I'm a very good listener

763
01:14:20,928 --> 01:14:22,529
and I'm extremely funny.

764
01:14:25,566 --> 01:14:27,765
Okay.

765
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:29,735
How do we stop
this thing?

766
01:14:29,737 --> 01:14:32,172
We choose our weapons
and our ground,

767
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,706
we set up a kill box,

768
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,541
and then we use Dani
to bring it to us.

769
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:38,710
- What?
- And then we take it down.

770
01:14:38,712 --> 01:14:41,713
No. No way.
Dani is not bait.

771
01:14:41,715 --> 01:14:43,415
Sarah is right.

772
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:47,119
Our one tactical advantage is that
the Terminator only sees its mission.

773
01:14:47,121 --> 01:14:49,755
Wherever Dani goes,
he will follow.

774
01:14:49,757 --> 01:14:51,823
Damn right it will.
And I will be there.

775
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:55,761
Well, I'm not about to stake
her out like some goat for you.

776
01:14:55,763 --> 01:14:57,596
What's your plan?
More running?

777
01:14:57,598 --> 01:15:01,033
My plan is to hide her at the
bottom of a mineshaft if I have to.

778
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:03,201
- At least until I...
- Just stop it!

779
01:15:03,203 --> 01:15:05,372
I'm not hiding at the
bottom of a mineshaft.

780
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:11,009
I'm not gonna live in fear
the rest of my life.

781
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:13,447
Even if your plan means
that might not be long.

782
01:15:15,582 --> 01:15:17,918
I want to stand and fight.

783
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,253
So, we choose
our weapons

784
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:22,788
and our ground.

785
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,423
We're gonna set up a...

786
01:15:24,425 --> 01:15:26,224
- Kill box.
- Kill box.

787
01:15:26,226 --> 01:15:28,829
And then, we're gonna
use me as bait.

788
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:31,565
And then,
we kill that thing.

789
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,167
Okay?

790
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:37,604
This plan has a high
probability of success.

791
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:45,112
Okay.

792
01:15:47,614 --> 01:15:48,615
What weapons?

793
01:16:09,937 --> 01:16:12,070
You just keep these around?

794
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:14,673
Even without
a rogue AI taking over,

795
01:16:14,675 --> 01:16:16,708
I calculate a 74% chance

796
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:19,911
that human civilization
will collapse into barbarism.

797
01:16:19,913 --> 01:16:21,446
And in that eventuality,

798
01:16:21,448 --> 01:16:24,385
these weapons will be vital
to protect my family.

799
01:16:25,854 --> 01:16:27,054
Also...

800
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:29,923
this is Texas.

801
01:16:41,502 --> 01:16:42,603
Go. Rapid fire.

802
01:16:47,274 --> 01:16:49,274
You're anticipating
the recoil.

803
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:51,245
Put your weight forward,
arms up.

804
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:53,011
And wider stance.

805
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:54,146
Don't lock out
your elbows.

806
01:16:54,148 --> 01:16:55,614
Enough of this bullshit.

807
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:57,084
Let's get serious.

808
01:17:05,259 --> 01:17:07,626
A Terminator has just
killed your whole family.

809
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:08,996
What do you do?

810
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,608
You know these guns
won't kill it.

811
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:25,179
They'll only slow him down.

812
01:17:26,547 --> 01:17:29,681
According to your description
of his capabilities,

813
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:31,082
our best option
is to secure

814
01:17:31,084 --> 01:17:32,953
a military-grade
energy weapon.

815
01:17:33,787 --> 01:17:34,988
An EMP?

816
01:17:36,089 --> 01:17:37,222
What is that?

817
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:39,257
An electromagnetic pulse.

818
01:17:39,259 --> 01:17:40,792
If we had one
close range,

819
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:42,296
it would fry a Rev-9.

820
01:17:43,096 --> 01:17:45,263
I might know a guy.

821
01:17:45,265 --> 01:17:47,734
Air Force intelligence officer
out of Bingham.

822
01:17:48,635 --> 01:17:50,368
It's 94 miles from here.

823
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:52,005
We should leave
this afternoon.

824
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,841
Okay.

825
01:17:54,843 --> 01:17:57,275
You've been tracking me?

826
01:17:57,277 --> 01:18:00,345
If you want to keep your phone
in a bag of potato chips,

827
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:02,749
then keep your phone
in a bag of potato chips.

828
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:28,640
Take good care of Mama.

829
01:18:28,642 --> 01:18:29,743
I will.

830
01:18:30,344 --> 01:18:31,578
You're gonna be okay.

831
01:19:10,651 --> 01:19:12,119
What did you tell them?

832
01:19:13,153 --> 01:19:14,419
I told them
you coming here

833
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:17,155
makes this place unsafe
for them.

834
01:19:17,157 --> 01:19:21,461
Also, the day I warned them
might come, has come.

835
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:24,565
My past has
caught up with me.

836
01:19:26,901 --> 01:19:28,101
And...

837
01:19:30,304 --> 01:19:31,738
I won't be back.

838
01:19:37,845 --> 01:19:39,179
Do you love them?

839
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:44,151
Not like a human can.

840
01:19:45,252 --> 01:19:47,588
For many years I thought
it was an advantage.

841
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:51,692
It isn't.

842
01:19:53,962 --> 01:19:55,362
I'm sorry.

843
01:20:05,873 --> 01:20:07,472
I just want you to know

844
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:10,277
that when Dani's safe
and this is all over,

845
01:20:11,612 --> 01:20:13,113
I am going to kill you.

846
01:20:14,082 --> 01:20:15,582
I understand.

847
01:21:28,156 --> 01:21:31,256
There's much more to it
than just picking the right color.

848
01:21:31,258 --> 01:21:34,994
It's the texture,
the weight of the material.

849
01:21:34,996 --> 01:21:37,362
- One wrong choice...
- Sarah, you okay?

850
01:21:37,364 --> 01:21:40,231
...it can destroy
the look of the entire room.

851
01:21:40,233 --> 01:21:41,801
- Fine.
- There was this one customer

852
01:21:41,803 --> 01:21:42,968
that came to me.

853
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,870
He wanted to have
solid-color drapes

854
01:21:44,872 --> 01:21:46,237
in a little girl's room.

855
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:47,875
I said, "Don't do it."

856
01:21:48,943 --> 01:21:50,742
You need butterflies,

857
01:21:50,744 --> 01:21:52,379
polka dots, balloons.

858
01:22:05,193 --> 01:22:06,727
Stay put.

859
01:22:12,066 --> 01:22:15,201
Always good
to see you, Major.

860
01:22:15,203 --> 01:22:17,604
It's never good
to see you, Connor.

861
01:22:18,538 --> 01:22:20,607
You got my birthday present?

862
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:31,449
You know, Sarah,

863
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:33,720
I don't commit treason
for just anybody.

864
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:37,555
What's the range
of the EMP

865
01:22:37,557 --> 01:22:39,559
against a Class Four
hardened target?

866
01:22:41,162 --> 01:22:42,496
Bodyguard?

867
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:44,932
I do drapes.

868
01:22:47,135 --> 01:22:50,102
He's part of
my operations team.

869
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:52,974
And he should just
shut the fuck up.

870
01:22:54,608 --> 01:22:56,743
Major, what kind of helos
fly out of Bingham?

871
01:22:58,411 --> 01:23:00,781
Black Hawks
and Chinooks. Why?

872
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,283
He's found us.

873
01:23:11,893 --> 01:23:12,894
Take cover!

874
01:23:15,196 --> 01:23:17,064
Major!

875
01:23:23,938 --> 01:23:25,338
We're in. Go.

876
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:58,170
Head for the base.
About two miles down this road.

877
01:23:58,172 --> 01:23:59,606
It'll be on us again
in a minute.

878
01:24:04,377 --> 01:24:05,811
This is Major Dean,

879
01:24:05,813 --> 01:24:08,981
361st Intelligence, Surveillance,
and Reconnaissance Group.

880
01:24:08,983 --> 01:24:11,183
<i>Declaring THREATCON Delta.</i>

881
01:24:11,185 --> 01:24:14,686
<i>I'm currently two miles south of
Bingham Air Base in a white van.</i>

882
01:24:14,688 --> 01:24:16,487
<i>Headed for the west gate.</i>

883
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:19,659
<i>Pursued by hostiles
in a stolen police helicopter.</i>

884
01:24:30,271 --> 01:24:31,703
Where are we going?

885
01:24:31,705 --> 01:24:33,638
Can't all those soldiers
back there help us?

886
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,809
They'll be able to slow it
down, but they can't kill it.

887
01:24:36,811 --> 01:24:38,077
The C-5.

888
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:39,345
Can you fly that?

889
01:24:39,347 --> 01:24:40,680
Of course.

890
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:44,350
<i>You are
entering unauthorized airspace.</i>

891
01:24:44,352 --> 01:24:46,720
<i>Turn around now
or we will open fire.</i>

892
01:24:49,824 --> 01:24:50,825
Get ready.

893
01:24:57,764 --> 01:24:58,931
What the hell?

894
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:00,565
Stand down!

895
01:25:00,567 --> 01:25:03,104
These people are district
contractors. Friendlies.

896
01:25:04,437 --> 01:25:06,038
I'll do what I can
to cover your backs

897
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,407
until you can get airborne.

898
01:25:18,485 --> 01:25:21,122
Hey, they're
not clear! Stop 'em!

899
01:25:35,036 --> 01:25:36,137
We have been reacquired.

900
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:41,809
Take cover!

901
01:25:47,014 --> 01:25:48,481
Don't touch me.

902
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:23,650
I'm out.

903
01:26:41,501 --> 01:26:42,702
Carl!

904
01:27:27,148 --> 01:27:28,615
Sorry about your shed.

905
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:35,553
<i>Bridge 42,
this is Viper 16. Stay in tension.</i>

906
01:27:35,555 --> 01:27:37,122
Hopefully they won't
shoot us down.

907
01:27:37,124 --> 01:27:38,756
<i>Noble Eagle Ops,
this is Viper 16.</i>

908
01:27:38,758 --> 01:27:39,825
Where are we going?

909
01:27:39,827 --> 01:27:41,726
Figuring that out next.

910
01:27:41,728 --> 01:27:44,496
But those Humvees are rigged
for parachute landing,

911
01:27:44,498 --> 01:27:45,998
so we can punch out

912
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,002
and then find some remote
spot to use the EMP.

913
01:27:48,568 --> 01:27:49,937
We have a problem.

914
01:27:58,112 --> 01:28:03,048
So... if we fight him
without those, can we win?

915
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:07,154
Based on the weapons we have,
I estimate our chances at 12%.

916
01:28:11,325 --> 01:28:12,725
That's not zero.

917
01:28:13,394 --> 01:28:14,560
It's not much better.

918
01:28:14,562 --> 01:28:17,229
Then we have to find
some more weapons

919
01:28:17,231 --> 01:28:18,564
and we stick to the plan.

920
01:28:18,566 --> 01:28:22,002
- We set the trap and then we can...
- No, Dani, you can't do that.

921
01:28:23,904 --> 01:28:24,972
Why?

922
01:28:25,906 --> 01:28:28,173
Because my son is supposed
to save us all?

923
01:28:28,175 --> 01:28:29,310
And until then, what?

924
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:31,944
We just keep
watching people die?

925
01:28:31,946 --> 01:28:33,545
The future of the human race
depends on you making it...

926
01:28:33,547 --> 01:28:35,280
I don't give a shit
about the future.

927
01:28:35,282 --> 01:28:38,550
Or what I'm maybe
supposed to do someday.

928
01:28:38,552 --> 01:28:41,322
What matters are the
choices we make now.

929
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:46,827
I've seen that look
too many times before.

930
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:50,197
You knew me.

931
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:55,970
In the future.

932
01:28:57,905 --> 01:28:58,906
Yeah.

933
01:29:01,475 --> 01:29:02,877
I know you.

934
01:29:04,044 --> 01:29:05,212
It was you...

935
01:29:07,214 --> 01:29:10,050
who found me in the ruins
after Judgment Day.

936
01:29:11,051 --> 01:29:12,219
<i>You saved me.</i>

937
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:44,151
HKs.

938
01:29:45,886 --> 01:29:49,190
Shoot me, and we'll all
be dead in 10 seconds.

939
01:29:50,157 --> 01:29:52,860
This is what Legion
wants us to do.

940
01:29:54,528 --> 01:29:55,762
Kill each other.

941
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:03,902
We should be fighting
the machines.

942
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:06,737
What's the point?
We can't win.

943
01:30:06,739 --> 01:30:09,575
Legion didn't exist
until humans created it.

944
01:30:09,577 --> 01:30:11,111
We made that thing.

945
01:30:11,879 --> 01:30:13,214
We can destroy it.

946
01:30:13,981 --> 01:30:15,746
Are we supposed
to lie down and die

947
01:30:15,748 --> 01:30:17,885
because some machine
decided it?

948
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,387
Is that our fate?

949
01:30:21,655 --> 01:30:23,057
Well, fuck fate.

950
01:30:44,645 --> 01:30:45,913
What's your name?

951
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:47,381
Grace.

952
01:30:57,291 --> 01:30:58,292
Grace.

953
01:30:59,493 --> 01:31:00,861
I'm Daniella.

954
01:31:02,263 --> 01:31:03,264
Dani.

955
01:31:05,599 --> 01:31:06,834
<i>You saved me</i>

956
01:31:08,269 --> 01:31:09,503
<i>and you raised me,</i>

957
01:31:13,507 --> 01:31:15,142
<i>and you taught me to hope.</i>

958
01:31:18,045 --> 01:31:21,315
<i>Like you saved
and taught the others.</i>

959
01:31:23,751 --> 01:31:26,752
<i>You turned scavengers
into militias</i>

960
01:31:26,754 --> 01:31:29,154
<i>and militias into an army.</i>

961
01:31:29,156 --> 01:31:33,827
<i>We rose up out of the ashes
and we took our world back.</i>

962
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,931
You taught us

963
01:31:39,733 --> 01:31:41,802
there is no fate

964
01:31:42,836 --> 01:31:45,139
but what we make
for ourselves.

965
01:31:50,711 --> 01:31:51,912
Dani,

966
01:31:53,647 --> 01:31:58,285
you are not the mother of
some man who saves the future.

967
01:32:01,455 --> 01:32:02,923
You are the future.

968
01:32:04,692 --> 01:32:06,527
That's why Legion
wants you dead.

969
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:11,932
She's John.

970
01:32:18,672 --> 01:32:20,007
You're John.

971
01:32:21,108 --> 01:32:23,110
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before.

972
01:32:24,178 --> 01:32:27,014
But you told me that
the Dani I'd meet in the past

973
01:32:28,015 --> 01:32:29,350
couldn't handle it.

974
01:32:30,317 --> 01:32:32,186
But you're not that
Dani anymore.

975
01:32:34,121 --> 01:32:35,422
<i>Delta Echo 12.</i>

976
01:32:35,989 --> 01:32:37,391
<i>This is KC-320.</i>

977
01:32:38,025 --> 01:32:39,259
<i>Ready to refuel.</i>

978
01:32:39,727 --> 01:32:40,928
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

979
01:32:45,532 --> 01:32:48,602
<i>Copy that, KC-320,
but aren't you a bit early?</i>

980
01:32:53,207 --> 01:32:54,439
It's him.

981
01:32:54,441 --> 01:32:55,674
We gotta go. Now.

982
01:32:55,676 --> 01:32:56,877
Strap in to the Humvee.

983
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:46,527
Grace!

984
01:33:56,905 --> 01:33:58,172
Dani!

985
01:34:05,847 --> 01:34:07,114
Dani!

986
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,351
Fuck.

987
01:34:18,592 --> 01:34:20,160
Open the cargo bay.

988
01:35:05,639 --> 01:35:06,640
I'll get Sarah!

989
01:35:10,912 --> 01:35:13,580
- Sarah! The door?
- It's jammed!

990
01:36:10,137 --> 01:36:11,505
Get the straps.

991
01:36:53,714 --> 01:36:54,715
Shit!

992
01:36:58,185 --> 01:36:59,386
What's happening?

993
01:37:08,795 --> 01:37:10,997
Grace! Where is she?

994
01:37:10,999 --> 01:37:12,299
I don't see her.

995
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:15,268
Oh, fuck.

996
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:28,682
Got two more.
They're bringing 'em in.

997
01:37:29,884 --> 01:37:30,885
Guys!

998
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:37,357
What the shit?

999
01:37:55,143 --> 01:37:57,242
Oh, my God! Grace.

1000
01:37:57,244 --> 01:37:59,446
- I thought you were dead.
- We're dropping too fast.

1001
01:38:29,209 --> 01:38:31,511
Three, two, one!

1002
01:38:34,548 --> 01:38:36,349
- My God!
- Oh, shit!

1003
01:38:46,828 --> 01:38:47,895
Dani, get out.

1004
01:38:49,663 --> 01:38:51,933
- It's blocked!
- It's not gonna hold!

1005
01:38:53,233 --> 01:38:54,434
Hold on!

1006
01:38:59,473 --> 01:39:00,507
No!

1007
01:39:06,948 --> 01:39:07,982
Sarah?

1008
01:39:08,883 --> 01:39:10,918
- What is it?
- My shoulder.

1009
01:39:11,785 --> 01:39:13,318
It's dislocated.

1010
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,889
So you're a doctor now?

1011
01:39:17,825 --> 01:39:19,024
Fuck!

1012
01:39:31,538 --> 01:39:33,573
He's coming.
We can't stay here.

1013
01:39:38,311 --> 01:39:39,579
Oh, shit.

1014
01:39:43,084 --> 01:39:44,317
What is she doing?

1015
01:39:46,386 --> 01:39:48,655
No, no, Grace. Really?

1016
01:39:49,756 --> 01:39:50,823
Strap in!

1017
01:39:50,825 --> 01:39:53,895
Right. Otherwise
it could be dangerous.

1018
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:30,865
Try to find the lights.

1019
01:40:42,409 --> 01:40:43,610
Get down!

1020
01:40:48,816 --> 01:40:51,917
There's a parachute
back there. Grab it.

1021
01:40:51,919 --> 01:40:54,088
We can tangle him up.

1022
01:40:57,457 --> 01:40:58,723
Listen to me.

1023
01:40:58,725 --> 01:41:01,827
It comes,
you pull this cord.

1024
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:02,828
This cord.

1025
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:05,632
And then you swim past it
up to the surface.

1026
01:41:07,201 --> 01:41:08,401
Okay.

1027
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:10,135
Okay.

1028
01:42:05,092 --> 01:42:06,093
Grace.

1029
01:42:15,303 --> 01:42:16,501
Where is it?

1030
01:42:16,503 --> 01:42:18,037
I don't know.
I lost him.

1031
01:42:18,039 --> 01:42:19,437
We can't stay here.

1032
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:21,240
We gotta go.

1033
01:42:21,242 --> 01:42:22,740
All right.

1034
01:42:29,317 --> 01:42:31,116
Can you
make it up there?

1035
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:32,186
I don't know.

1036
01:42:44,999 --> 01:42:46,999
It's locked.

1037
01:42:47,001 --> 01:42:48,135
Let me try.

1038
01:42:57,979 --> 01:42:58,980
Grace.

1039
01:43:00,247 --> 01:43:01,548
Wait.

1040
01:43:02,716 --> 01:43:05,052
There's maybe another door.

1041
01:43:08,089 --> 01:43:09,190
Shit.

1042
01:43:10,958 --> 01:43:12,424
Grace!

1043
01:43:14,395 --> 01:43:16,728
Dani, you have to run.

1044
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:19,166
- You have to run. We can't protect you.
- What?

1045
01:43:21,701 --> 01:43:25,705
I'm the only one of us
who can still throw a punch.

1046
01:43:27,408 --> 01:43:28,843
There's another weapon.

1047
01:43:30,177 --> 01:43:31,243
What?

1048
01:43:31,245 --> 01:43:32,545
My power source.

1049
01:43:34,681 --> 01:43:37,818
How do we get it out of you
without killing you?

1050
01:43:39,619 --> 01:43:41,621
- You can't.
- No!

1051
01:44:03,044 --> 01:44:04,045
What?

1052
01:44:26,067 --> 01:44:27,866
You look terrible.

1053
01:44:27,868 --> 01:44:30,104
At least I still
have all my face.

1054
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:34,108
You left this
on the plane.

1055
01:44:36,911 --> 01:44:38,578
I can't get
through that door.

1056
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,915
Come on! Hurry!

1057
01:45:17,518 --> 01:45:18,817
We have to move.

1058
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:20,452
He's not far behind.

1059
01:45:20,454 --> 01:45:21,721
No.

1060
01:45:22,423 --> 01:45:24,158
We make our stand here.

1061
01:45:26,594 --> 01:45:28,795
This is our kill box.

1062
01:45:43,344 --> 01:45:44,812
Dani.

1063
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:51,185
I'm not running!

1064
01:46:02,596 --> 01:46:03,998
Give me the girl.

1065
01:46:05,633 --> 01:46:06,934
No.

1066
01:46:10,804 --> 01:46:12,705
You really should.

1067
01:46:13,673 --> 01:46:16,277
You and I were built
for the same purpose.

1068
01:46:16,944 --> 01:46:18,709
And Legion is the only future.

1069
01:46:18,711 --> 01:46:20,848
I came from a future
like that.

1070
01:46:21,315 --> 01:46:22,682
It failed.

1071
01:46:25,286 --> 01:46:27,855
I know she's
a stranger to you.

1072
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,156
Why not just
let me have her?

1073
01:46:31,158 --> 01:46:34,929
Because we're not machines,
you metal motherfucker.

1074
01:47:09,697 --> 01:47:10,996
Grace!

1075
01:47:10,998 --> 01:47:12,264
Hey! Hey!

1076
01:47:12,266 --> 01:47:13,867
I'm over here!

1077
01:47:25,112 --> 01:47:26,113
Move.

1078
01:47:30,985 --> 01:47:32,086
Sarah!

1079
01:49:22,796 --> 01:49:23,997
Move!

1080
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:08,607
Where's Grace?

1081
01:50:08,609 --> 01:50:10,144
I don't know.

1082
01:50:12,746 --> 01:50:14,081
Oh, there she is.

1083
01:50:14,883 --> 01:50:16,816
Grace! Grace!

1084
01:50:16,818 --> 01:50:18,352
Are you okay?

1085
01:50:22,656 --> 01:50:23,924
Grace.

1086
01:50:49,483 --> 01:50:50,584
Sarah!

1087
01:50:58,759 --> 01:51:00,091
It's not dead.

1088
01:51:00,093 --> 01:51:02,629
Wait. We gotta take you
out of here.

1089
01:51:03,932 --> 01:51:06,467
Okay? Grace, let's go.

1090
01:51:07,201 --> 01:51:09,034
My power source.

1091
01:51:09,036 --> 01:51:11,570
Get it close,
and it'll fry his neural net.

1092
01:51:11,572 --> 01:51:13,040
Grace...

1093
01:51:14,708 --> 01:51:15,875
I can't.

1094
01:51:15,877 --> 01:51:18,045
Yes, you can.

1095
01:51:35,229 --> 01:51:36,495
Dani.

1096
01:51:36,497 --> 01:51:39,066
This is what
you sent me here to do.

1097
01:51:49,343 --> 01:51:50,775
No.

1098
01:51:50,777 --> 01:51:53,013
We both knew
I wasn't coming back.

1099
01:51:57,986 --> 01:52:00,118
- I can't.
- Dani, please.

1100
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,688
You saved me.

1101
01:52:02,924 --> 01:52:04,224
Let me save you.

1102
01:52:08,629 --> 01:52:09,862
- Please.
- No.

1103
01:52:09,864 --> 01:52:11,064
You do it.

1104
01:52:12,132 --> 01:52:13,398
Do it, Dani.

1105
01:52:23,043 --> 01:52:24,545
I'm sorry, Grace.

1106
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:31,184
I'm not.

1107
01:52:52,472 --> 01:52:54,441
I'm gonna kill you, fucker.

1108
01:53:21,903 --> 01:53:23,170
Hey!

1109
01:53:23,503 --> 01:53:24,703
Get up!

1110
01:53:24,705 --> 01:53:25,807
Help her!

1111
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:32,044
God damn it...

1112
01:53:32,046 --> 01:53:33,111
Carl!

1113
01:53:33,113 --> 01:53:34,314
Wake up!

1114
01:55:12,646 --> 01:55:13,815
For John.

1115
01:56:22,817 --> 01:56:24,351
We got him, Grace.

1116
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:30,557
You saved me.

1117
01:56:47,374 --> 01:56:48,675
<i>Grace!</i>

1118
01:56:50,211 --> 01:56:51,676
Grace, come on, honey.

1119
01:56:51,678 --> 01:56:52,847
It's time to go.

1120
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:07,061
- Come on, you two.
- Grab your stuff, you guys.

1121
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:28,816
I won't let her die
for me again.

1122
01:57:31,018 --> 01:57:33,520
Then you need to be ready.

1123
01:57:58,997 --> 01:58:03,997
