THE QUIET DUEL

3
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,795
Doctor.

4
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,734
Doctor.

5
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,006
Doctor.

6
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,174
Are you alright?

7
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,626
How many more?

8
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,928
Many more.
Patients keep coming.

9
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,915
Pretty bad.

10
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,894
- Miguel.
- Yes.

11
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,304
<i>- Fan.</i>
- Yes.

12
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,364
- Pulse?
- A bit fast.

13
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,903
Do something.

14
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,840
Take it off for me.

15
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,508
Are you alright?
Bring some Iodine.

16
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,224
He is getting weak.

17
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,522
- Camphor.
<i>- Yes.</i>

18
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:38,123
I want to see my wife.

19
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,051
I haven't seen her
for three years.

20
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,894
There are lots of women
everywhere.

21
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:52,400
My wife is to die for.

22
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:59,702
You know, I don't want to have
any weird disease here.

23
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:06,080
But because of a disease
you might be able to go home.

24
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,179
You...

25
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,563
- Private Nakata.
- Yes?

26
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,696
Do you have syphilis? Do you?

27
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,968
- Do you have it?!
- Yes.

28
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,275
- Horiguchi!
<i>- Yes?</i>

29
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,251
- Yes?
- Ah.

30
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,490
- About the soldier, Nakata...
- Yes?

31
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,063
- Do a blood test on him.
- Okay.

32
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,494
His cut doesn't close yet.

33
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,438
He seems to have a spirochete.

34
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,272
I can only test
for the blood reaction here.

35
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,333
- Yeah.
- Alright.

36
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,744
Do my blood test in a few days.

37
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,443
What? Your blood test, Doctor?

38
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:53,016
This cut was soaking
in his blood for an hour.

39
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,719
<i>Horiguchi!</i>

40
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,822
<i>- Horiguchi!</i>
- Yes!

41
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,225
Haven't you received the result
of the blood tests yet?

42
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,487
No.

43
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,732
It's been more than two weeks
since I sent my blood.

44
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,736
What did you receive
from the head office today?

45
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:14,830
Yes...

46
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,334
Why can't you say?

47
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,613
Since you are hiding it,
I know the result.

48
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,892
I tested positive, right?

49
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,460
- Doctor!
- I know.

50
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,555
Yes...

51
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,026
We don't have
Salvarsan here, do we?

52
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,066
I think we have a bit.

53
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,401
Antiphlogistic?

54
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,945
- You can go now.
- Yes.

55
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,660
SURGERY
OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST

56
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,049
Hey.

57
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,253
- Where is the doctor?
- He is here.

58
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,762
I am terribly sick today.

59
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,408
Are you playing sick again?

60
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,675
Poor people should die early
for their own good.

61
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,680
Are you still mad I stopped you
from killing yourself?

62
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,680
As the doctor said, can't you start
your new life as a nurse?

63
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,727
What about the baby?

64
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,991
- What can I do with this tummy?
- I'll tell you...

65
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:31,093
- you'll be glad to have the baby.
- How does a man know it?!

66
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,865
You can't give birth to a baby.

67
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,368
The doctor here is the same.

68
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:41,675
If he wants to help me,
he should get rid of the baby.

69
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,026
He's at the operating room.

70
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,995
- Will it be long?
- I think so.

71
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,366
- It's an "appe."
- Okay.

72
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,502
- What's an "appe"?
- Appendicitis.

73
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,572
"Appe."

74
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,614
"Appe." You start to sound
like a nurse now.

75
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:27,758
By the way, she is the wife-to-be
of the young doctor here, right?

76
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,093
She <i>was</i> his fianc×™.

77
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,030
- "Was"?
- Ms. Imai told me so.

78
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,861
He made her wait for six years.
Now he doesn't want to get married.

79
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,901
All men are like that.

80
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,967
Don't be ridiculous!
The doctor here is a fine man.

81
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,674
He is weird!
Ms. Imai was complaining...

82
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,045
that this hospital
used to be clean.

83
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,316
<i>Miss Minegishi!</i>
<i>Miss Minegishi, help us!</i>

84
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,699
I'm okay.

85
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,142
No need to worry.

86
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:28,152
Don't feed him for 24 hours.
Not even water.

87
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:33,154
- Can I take him back home?
- That's impossible.

88
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,490
- At least one week...
- You'll bankrupt me, idiot!

89
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:41,289
I can't pay 300
or 400 yen a day...

90
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,733
Dad, I'll cure it at home.

91
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,930
Could you buy me
a glove, though?

92
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,099
Doctor, can I go home?

93
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,369
What's your batting position?

94
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,967
- Third.
- Alright.

95
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,138
Sleep well
and dream of home runs.

96
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,714
If you get worse,
you can't play baseball. Alright?

97
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,156
Don't worry about the money.

98
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,123
We have extra rooms.

99
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,940
Hey, you look happy.

100
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:47,921
Hi.

101
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,431
I didn't know
you were coming today.

102
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,602
Wow, what beautiful flowers.

103
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,606
Thanks to you, this shed finally looks
like somebody lives here.

104
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,778
What were you looking at?

105
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,559
We were all young then.

106
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,899
Your house was very dirty.

107
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,835
What a rascal Kyoji looks here.

108
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:18,819
Can a war change
a person so much?

109
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:37,235
Miss Misao, about Kyoji...

110
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,103
Somehow...

111
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,017
I don't know what
he is thinking these days.

112
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,254
I am really sorry.

113
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:06,168
After making you
wait for six years...

114
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,805
he started to say he didn't want
to get married for a while.

115
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:16,243
I don't know what to say
to you and your parents...

116
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:24,455
Sir, please don't worry
about that.

117
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,753
I don't care about it...

118
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:41,201
I don't know what to say...
I don't know why...

119
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:48,175
but I feel like the time I spent
with Kyoji was an old fairy tale.

120
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,373
A fairy tale?

121
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:58,416
I am not a child any more.

122
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,522
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

123
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,667
I can... take care of myself...

124
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,371
- Kyoji, take her home.
- Ah.

125
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,781
- But I still have a patient.
- I'll do it. Take her home.

126
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:37,323
My father is getting
very weak these days.

127
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:44,325
My father seemed
to have given up our marriage...

128
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,234
a long time ago.

129
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,279
He started to say
he'll look for a man for me.

130
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,908
Then, is there a man for you?

131
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,912
- What do you think?
- If there is...

132
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,523
Should I marry him
if I like?

133
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:16,828
What if I say I'll wait for you
until I can marry you?

134
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,570
I think I told you
my thoughts about it...

135
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:25,201
But you haven't told me
why you can't marry me.

136
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,971
I'm scared to hear it.

137
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,685
But I'm prepared to hear
even a terrible thing.

138
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,588
Please tell me. Please.

139
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:47,464
Suppose... there is a man.

140
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,736
This is just an assumption.
It can be a man or a woman.

141
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,768
The person...
The body of the person...

142
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:03,176
is pure, but not pure.
It's dirty.

143
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,374
Have you ever imagined
those kinds of conditions?

144
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,424
Miss Minegishi! Miss Minegishi!

145
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,402
What?

146
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:31,735
It's weird. A box of Salvarsan
is gone again.

147
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,972
- Do you know about it?
- Salvarsan?

148
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,778
It's an injection for syphilis.

149
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:44,084
What?! What made you think
I know about the medicine?

150
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,715
Are you accusing me
of something?

151
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,955
I haven't fallen that much.

152
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,330
If I do things that can
give me syphilis, why I am so poor?

153
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:16,151
You said the body is pure,
but not pure.

154
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,986
I know you don't have
such a genetic disease.

155
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:28,925
Why can't you tell me the truth,
that you don't love me anymore?

156
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,999
I don't go to your place anymore.

157
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,606
Please give my best
to your father.

158
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,986
You... You can rest now.

159
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:39,034
You are working hard.
You must be tired.

160
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:43,666
I used to get that shot all the time.
It's vitamins, right?

161
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,854
"Salvarsan."

162
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,517
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

163
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,459
Did you dream
about a home run?

164
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:45,902
No. I only dreamed
about clean water running.

165
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,636
<i>Can I drink water?</i>
<i>It's been 24 hours.</i>

166
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,371
Okay. But just a little bit.

167
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,278
- Tea is good.
- Okay.

168
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:01,251
See! I told you
it's been 24 hours already.

169
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,915
Mother, you aren't flexible at all.

170
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,988
Doctor, there is a flea
in my plaster cast.

171
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:17,296
- Everybody says that.
- It itches so much.

172
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,697
- Can I give him this much?
- Sure.

173
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,703
It's special. Go ahead.

174
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,675
What? That's it?

175
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,286
Doctor, when can I eat?

176
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,790
Huh? After you pass gas.

177
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,818
After an appendectomy,
you'll be fine if you pass gas.

178
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,921
- Gas is the best.
- What's "gas?"

179
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,331
- Farts.
- What? That's it?

180
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,880
I came here again somehow.

181
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,617
My legs were moving
toward your place without knowing.

182
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:28,263
Kyoji, you are unhappy,
aren't you?

183
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,936
Why? Please tell me why.

184
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,308
Why? You're suffering
from something. Why?

185
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,610
Why have you changed so much?

186
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:45,349
- I just got old. That's all.
- That's a lie!

187
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,791
Sometimes you seem
like you're from...

188
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:54,696
a different world,
somewhere far.

189
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,266
Oops. Did I interrupt you?

190
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,265
Are you studying for the test?

191
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,698
What? What test
are you talking about?

192
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,401
<i>A test for nurses.</i>

193
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,712
It's not fun
being a probationary nurse.

194
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,218
That test?
Sure, I'm studying for it.

195
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:52,353
But, I'm not sure
a one-time dancer like me...

196
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,983
can do such a sacred job.

197
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,686
Even a reliable person
like Ms. Imai...

198
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,596
says she'll quit soon.

199
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:10,503
I asked Ms. Imai to stay, but...

200
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:15,137
I can't force anything on anybody.
A nurse's job is tough.

201
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:24,247
The world
isn't that easy a place...

202
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,986
as a young lady thinks it is.

203
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:32,519
Right. It may not be.

204
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:38,057
I don't care
if you speak ill of me, but...

205
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:44,404
Oh, did I speak ill of you?

206
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:52,075
No, you didn't speak ill of me.

207
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,449
What I meant is...
You can criticize me...

208
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:04,024
but I think you should appreciate
what Kyoji did for you.

209
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,432
Of course I do.

210
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:17,941
I got pregnant... I couldn't eat...

211
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,075
I was abandoned by a man.

212
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,879
Then I tried to kill myself
and he saved me.

213
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:30,814
He even offered me to stay here.

214
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:39,429
But if I had money at that time...

215
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,367
I would've gotten rid
of the baby...

216
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,961
and lived happily ever after.

217
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,600
If you didn't want to have a baby,
why weren't you more careful?

218
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,611
The father is an asshole
who took a dancer to a hotel...

219
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,137
and can't take responsibilities
for his own baby...

220
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,413
You should ask him
for a certain responsibility.

221
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:05,252
- That's troublesome!
- You're a monster!

222
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,096
- Miss, are you running away?
- Miss Minegishi!

223
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:35,316
<i>The baby you have</i>
<i>already has eyes and a nose.</i>

224
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:46,822
You're such a humanitarian.
You're good at pretending.

225
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:54,628
But then, why are you
injecting Salvarsan?!

226
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,507
Life is funny, isn't it?

227
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,209
There are wheels within wheels.

228
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,460
I was surprised.

229
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,174
I thought there was no one
in the examining room...

230
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,869
and turned off the light.

231
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:37,677
They moved suddenly.
The doctors are still working.

232
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,046
They were talking
about something serious.

233
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,522
Their financial condition
must be pretty bad.

234
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,627
You are an innocent girl.

235
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:57,090
The father and the son may be
secretly doing something bad.

236
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,365
- No way.
- Then...

237
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,373
do you know who's been
stealing Salvarsan?

238
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,471
That's why you are so innocent.

239
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,818
- Where are you going?
- I'll eavesdrop on them.

240
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:26,120
When people speak secretly,
you can sometimes hear the truth.

241
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:33,163
I... will beat up...

242
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,398
the hypocrite!

243
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,343
He called me a monster!
He is the monster!

244
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,078
I shouldn't have asked.

245
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,722
I wanted you to tell me
that Minegishi was wrong.

246
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:05,030
I didn't want to believe
you've been injecting Salvarsan.

247
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:10,770
I can't believe... my son has...

248
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,575
How bad is it?

249
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,849
Wassermann reaction is 3 plus.

250
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:24,354
Kyoji! Aren't you
ashamed of yourself?

251
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,591
I can't forgive you! I can't!

252
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,294
I can't forgive you for Misao.

253
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,529
- Father, I was...
- I don't want to hear your excuse.

254
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,007
I cut my finger
while operating.

255
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,844
And I received this spirochete
from the patient.

256
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:10,067
When I realized the patient
had a horrible disease...

257
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:15,231
I... thought of the worst disease.

258
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,170
And... I was right.

259
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,373
Kyoji, I'm ashamed.

260
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,342
I imagined a foolish thing.

261
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,214
- That's okay.
- No.

262
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:06,388
Even if I'm your father, I have
to apologize to you when I have to.

263
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,455
Please forgive me.

264
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,431
But, Kyoji...

265
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,566
why didn't you tell me earlier?

266
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:30,914
I don't understand
the politics of the country.

267
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:06,779
Now I know
why you are refusing Misao.

268
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,186
I know why you are helping
unfortunate people, too.

269
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,755
I have experience, too...

270
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,359
but misfortune
makes people stubborn.

271
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,529
I'm talking about Misao, too.

272
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,795
You don't have to be
so meticulous to her.

273
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,431
I know. But...

274
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,410
it might take three
or five years to heal it.

275
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,979
I was sent to many places
during the war.

276
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,413
Without medicine,
my disease worsened.

277
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,394
How old is Misao?

278
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,834
- Twenty seven.
- Right.

279
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:08,908
But, Kyoji... I think...

280
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,176
you should tell Misao everything.

281
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,740
So that Misao
can forget about you.

282
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,920
I can't tell her that.

283
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,760
I thought of it a lot.

284
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,673
- But I can't tell her.
- Why?

285
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,144
If I tell her everything...

286
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,739
I know she'll say she'll wait for me
for five or ten years until I heal.

287
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,181
I can't do that to her.

288
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,752
I know Misao will wait.

289
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,328
- She is such a woman.
- Then, Kyoji...

290
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,834
I don't have the courage
to take away her life like that!

291
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:30,126
Mr. Kondo! Mr. Kondo!

292
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,686
Please be quiet.
It's after 11:00.

293
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,459
It came out!

294
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,728
What? What came out?

295
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,600
The kid's gas!

296
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,817
Quiet now or the doctor
will be mad at you.

297
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:17,267
How was it?
What did they talk about?

298
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,178
Do you want some?

299
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,604
<i>Yesterday... your father</i>
<i>came to my house.</i>

300
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,311
<i>He came to decline</i>
<i>our engagement formally.</i>

301
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,378
<i>I asked him the reason</i>
<i>many times...</i>

302
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:10,092
<i>but I couldn't understand why</i>
<i>you are breaking off the engagement.</i>

303
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:17,557
Half of my heart gave up.

304
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,637
But the other half of my heart...

305
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:30,169
doesn't give up and wants
to know the reason desperately.

306
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,230
I've been thinking...

307
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:57,401
I've been depending
on you too much.

308
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:02,542
You knew our house needed
a woman's hand.

309
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,706
So you came here
every day to help out.

310
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:09,085
I asked you
not to come anymore.

311
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,755
But I was still
depending on you.

312
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:18,228
I'm selfish, but please
don't come here anymore.

313
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:26,803
I'll come here tomorrow,
the next day... every day.

314
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:40,341
What do you want
for dinner tonight?

315
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,395
Come in.

316
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:07,835
The appendicitis kid
wants to say goodbye to you.

317
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,037
Okay.

318
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,987
Miss.

319
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:15,912
I decided to take the nurse test.

320
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,014
Really? Kyoji will be
happy to hear that.

321
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,484
I'll give birth to the baby, too.

322
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,320
What a change.

323
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,929
- Miss.
- What?

324
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:40,603
I have a favor to ask.

325
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,272
I think... the doctor is great.

326
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:53,874
Could you tell him
that I said that?

327
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:03,350
I realized
that I misunderstood him.

328
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,552
I know I should
apologize to him myself.

329
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,866
But it's kind of late.

330
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:17,501
But I at least told you that.
I feel good now.

331
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,313
<i>Hey.</i>

332
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,990
Are you studying?

333
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,961
I can't be
a probationary nurse forever.

334
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,905
You have changed.

335
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,538
How's your baby?

336
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,881
He's sleeping
in the nurses' room.

337
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,941
He is cute, isn't he?

338
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:41,547
Kids are troublesome.
That's all.

339
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,319
You still have a sharp tongue.

340
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:50,622
- You came here for treatment?
- Not today.

341
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,500
I want the doctor
to come to my office.

342
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,696
I have an injured guy.

343
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:01,636
It's a terrible story.
My colleague was inspecting cars...

344
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,613
and suddenly a passenger
attacked him.

345
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,047
He is quite a gentleman, though.

346
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:12,217
- He is a mad dog.
- That's right.

347
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,190
He suddenly raised his stick
and... Ouch!

348
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,456
I think I'd better
examine his head, then.

349
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,227
How's he doing?

350
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,462
He's investigating now.

351
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,596
- Come to see me when you can.
- Thank you.

352
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,903
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

353
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:37,380
<i>- Address.</i>
<i>- 1-11 Atano-cho, Minato-ku.</i>

354
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,779
<i>- Name?</i>
<i>- Susumu Nakata.</i>

355
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:48,657
Oh, hi. Thank you very much
for coming. How is he?

356
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:52,593
He is fine. The injury
will be cured in one week.

357
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,126
- Can I come in?
- Yes. Come in.

358
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,035
Did you just say
you are Nakata?

359
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,906
Hey! It's you!

360
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,460
Thanks for taking care of me
at that time.

361
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:34,361
- How is it?
- Good. My wound adhered now.

362
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:38,530
Did you go to a doctor
about the disease?

363
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,270
I went to see the doctor
many times.

364
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,973
- But I'm healed now.
- The doctor said so?

365
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:48,041
I can't go through everything
the doctor said.

366
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:53,656
But a spirochete
is a very dangerous bacteria.

367
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,022
Yeah. But there is
nothing else I can do.

368
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,995
- Did your baby fall asleep?
- Yes.

369
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,497
The great doctor
was holding him.

370
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,332
I feel sorry for him.

371
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:43,867
He could've held
his own grandchild by now.

372
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:48,470
- Shall I give you an injection?
- Yes, please.

373
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,817
How's the result
of the blood test?

374
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,150
It was 2 plus.

375
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:06,093
How long do you have
to inject this medicine?

376
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:11,900
I inject it for three months
and rest for a month.

377
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:15,631
I need to continue doing that.

378
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:19,038
- Until the medicine is gone.
- Then...

379
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:23,168
how long does it take
to heal completely?

380
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:28,047
Well, I aggravated the disease.
So I don't know how long.

381
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,680
I hate him!

382
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:38,391
The guy who gave you this disease...
Is he alive?

383
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:44,865
I heard it.

384
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,870
- From my father?
- No.

385
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,639
I heard it when I was still pregnant.

386
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:58,003
You and your father were talking
about it here at night.

387
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:04,878
At that time, this place
was more lively. Don't you think?

388
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:08,421
Ms. Imai is gone.

389
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,723
Miss Misao
hasn't showed up since.

390
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,290
I heard she is getting married.

391
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,535
<i>Doctor!</i>
<i>Don't you blame the guy?!</i>

392
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,801
I'm talking about the guy
who gave you the disease!

393
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:29,709
I would curse him to death!

394
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,604
What a pest you are!

395
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,812
I'm not your patient anymore.

396
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:14,085
I think it is my duty as a doctor
to warn you.

397
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:18,093
I told you my disease is cured.

398
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,822
That's what you think.

399
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,093
That's unreliable.

400
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,629
Is the fluid of the spinal cord
minus now?

401
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,936
I don't think about
anything unpleasant.

402
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,077
But you have to think about
other people's happiness...

403
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,641
rather than your own.

404
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,283
What does that mean?!

405
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:02,633
Four years ago, on the day
you were sent back home...

406
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,264
I told you that...

407
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:09,409
- a spirochete...
- Infects even by saliva. Right?

408
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,710
But my wife is totally fine.

409
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:17,084
- Your wife?!
- That's right.

410
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:21,715
Our child is growing fine
in her tummy now.

411
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,627
In half a year...

412
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:29,062
I'll visit you
with my healthy baby.

413
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,570
See? Surprised, aren't you?

414
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:45,347
I am surprised...
by your reckless act.

415
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:51,519
I don't want to tell you this.

416
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:58,953
But I'll tell you because
I want you to be serious about it.

417
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,959
I got your spirochete in my body.

418
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:10,602
When I operated on you
at the field hospital...

419
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,301
I got it from this cut.

420
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,942
No way!

421
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:32,519
Just listen. It's not a lie.

422
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:44,173
Mr. Nakata,
my disease isn't cured yet.

423
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,438
And I'm still undergoing
the treatment.

424
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,940
Damn you!

425
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,578
It's none of your business!

426
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:03,286
Come to my hospital tomorrow
with your wife!

427
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,294
I'm not coming!

428
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,558
My father is a gynecologist.

429
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:15,764
He will try anything he can
to save your baby.

430
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:51,065
- Is the examination over?
- Yes.

431
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,041
What did he said?

432
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:56,309
He wants to talk to you.

433
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,152
It's a hard job.

434
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:41,486
Is that for the baby of a patient?

435
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:44,220
No. It's for my baby.

436
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:49,394
Really? When did you have him?

437
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,764
Just 50 days ago.

438
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:57,035
You're counting the days
since he was born.

439
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,734
- What?
- Well...

440
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,106
Because you answered me quickly.

441
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,479
Yeah. Without knowing it.

442
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:14,290
I mark the calendar,
so I count days without knowing it.

443
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,691
You're having a baby, aren't you?

444
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:22,186
<i>Hey!</i>

445
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,256
You asked me to come here
to humiliate me?!

446
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:30,773
That's ridiculous. That's why
I didn't tell your wife anything.

447
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,933
I'm sorry if we offend you.

448
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:38,770
But, as doctors,
we have to tell you everything.

449
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:45,577
If the mother is in serious condition,
I have to consider the worst.

450
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,283
What?! What does it mean?

451
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:51,359
Are you saying
my child will be retarded?!

452
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,899
That might happen.

453
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:00,931
If the baby gets early treatment,
he'll be fine.

454
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:05,532
But if it's too late, the baby
will be premature or stillborn.

455
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,236
There are many more
gynecologists out there.

456
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:11,974
Father, please let me talk to him.

457
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:31,956
Mr. Nakata,
let's talk about it calmly.

458
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,036
We have to think
how we can save your baby.

459
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,812
You are calm
because it's not about you.

460
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,404
But this is my first baby!

461
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:46,573
That's why...

462
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:51,218
That's why I warned you
not to do such a thing.

463
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,147
"Get treatment
when you get back home."

464
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,987
"Don't spread your disease."

465
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:01,794
"If you do,
you'll ruin people's lives."

466
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:09,295
This is nobody's fault,
but yours.

467
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:38,326
Please let me
join your conversation.

468
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,892
Were you listening
to our conversation?

469
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:45,665
Yes.

470
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,683
Sit down.

471
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,618
Mrs. Nakata.

472
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:47,125
I just wanted to tell Mr. Nakata
what I think.

473
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,797
I thought it better for the two of you
to talk quietly alone.

474
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:04,981
Akiko, it's already happened.

475
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:09,218
Alright?
I'll be careful from now on.

476
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,589
You're talking like
it's about someone else.

477
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:19,056
Men always talk like this.

478
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,697
But we think a lot.
Right, Dr. Fujisaki?

479
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:37,380
I won't ask you
to apologize to me deeply.

480
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:46,090
Because that
won't change anything.

481
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:53,295
Mrs. Nakata.

482
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,469
Can we talk about it calmly?

483
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:04,879
I'm single. So I don't know
what a husband and a wife is like.

484
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:11,316
But if you guys
talk calmly about it...

485
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,912
you might be able
to come to a good solution.

486
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,725
Maybe you are right.

487
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,965
Anyway, let's go home now.

488
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,963
You haven't come here
in a long time.

489
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,329
The wedding day was fixed, so...

490
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,034
Are you getting married?

491
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,737
My father is pretty weak now.

492
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:08,101
Women are no good
in those situations.

493
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,305
I think you are stronger
than most women.

494
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,075
I thought so, too.

495
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,319
But...

496
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,848
- Is Kyoji here?
- Yes.

497
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,696
Hi! Long time no see.

498
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,500
It's good to see you.

499
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:46,939
I've been busy
since the wedding date was set.

500
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:51,848
- How are your dinners?
- Don't worry.

501
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,515
Miss Minegishi
has been taking care of everything.

502
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:58,026
She is not good
at cooking, though.

503
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,062
I was worried.

504
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:05,895
Even when I was busy,
I was worried about it every evening.

505
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,863
And I thought of the kitchen here.

506
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,277
Do you want some tea?

507
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:26,153
Sure. I'll be a guest today.

508
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:31,516
Just like when I came here
for the first time.

509
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:34,292
Excuse me.

510
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,800
<i>What are you thinking about?</i>

511
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:20,765
- Nothing.
- Don't make me worry.

512
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:25,137
Please, sit down.

513
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,092
You're a guest.

514
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:52,973
If you love someone else...

515
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:57,035
and because of that
we have to say goodbye today...

516
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,741
I can give you up easier.

517
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,575
That must be true,
considering your personality.

518
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,051
Here.

519
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,391
I haven't understood
the reason yet.

520
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,224
I don't want
to say goodbye, but...

521
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:24,939
I'm sorry...

522
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,636
When is the wedding?

523
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,574
Tomorrow.

524
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,845
Tomorrow. That's very sudden.

525
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,524
They decided it suddenly.

526
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:51,561
- You'll be happy.
- Thank you.

527
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:56,103
Thanks for everything.

528
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,512
At what time is the wedding?

529
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:10,709
The wedding is at 2:00. We're leaving
for our honeymoon at 5:00.

530
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,657
The train will be crowded.

531
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,756
That's what I heard.

532
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:43,678
Kyoji... Promise you won't laugh.

533
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,019
What is it?

534
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:53,457
I want you to change your mind.

535
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:56,430
And I want you
to take me somewhere...

536
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,730
leaving your job and everything.

537
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:29,387
I... am going home.

538
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:46,306
I don't have much time today.

539
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,748
I'm sorry I can't
cook dinner for you.

540
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,153
I'll leave them here.

541
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:10,694
Please be happy.
I can't wish you that enough.

542
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,037
Maybe I'll be happy.

543
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:21,113
But I'm not sure
how you'll do.

544
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,594
You better go home.

545
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,201
Yes.

546
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:47,598
How's your father?

547
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,704
He is playing
with Miss Minegishi's baby.

548
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,976
Should I go
and say goodbye to him?

549
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:59,214
You'd better not.
My father isn't good at goodbyes.

550
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:04,224
Please give my best to him.

551
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:11,623
Good bye, then.
I won't take you home.

552
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:16,732
I don't want you
to take me home, either.

553
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:18,189
- Do you want your injection?
- Yeah.

554
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:33,078
Is it about Miss Misao?

555
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:37,017
She was a great lady.

556
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,826
Ms. Imai used to say to me...

557
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:53,692
she didn't understand
why you didn't act like other men.

558
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:01,335
She said that even if you weren't
getting married to her...

559
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:05,243
it was impossible to control
your desire forever.

560
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,245
Imai is a realistic person.

561
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:21,195
Tell me, doctor...

562
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:26,696
is it easy for men...

563
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:30,533
to control physical desire?

564
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:34,670
Why do you ask?

565
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,975
Because you are really calm.

566
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:47,682
There are two kinds
of patients, right?

567
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,584
Some scream in pain.

568
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,886
Others put up with pain
dripping with sweat.

569
01:13:54,663 --> 01:14:00,226
Then you are
the dripping with sweat type?

570
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:04,602
Because I don't like losing...
and I am a doctor.

571
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:10,805
But doctors are human, too.
Right?

572
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,477
Right.

573
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:25,721
Today I found out she will be
the wife of some other guy.

574
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:30,721
I thought I could
give up everything.

575
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,499
I can't!

576
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,201
Now...

577
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:47,547
I am fighting
with my own desire.

578
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,279
If I think back...

579
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:59,985
my desire is such a poor thing.

580
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,625
Before the war...

581
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,728
I restrained the desire
to pretend to be a decent man.

582
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:17,111
During the war,
I kept telling myself...

583
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,773
that a peaceful marriage
was waiting for me.

584
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:26,113
Misao was waiting for me.
So I controlled my desire.

585
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,558
But one day...

586
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,999
because of the blood
of a shameless guy...

587
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:48,268
my body became dirty
without knowing any pleasure.

588
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,112
I sometimes think...

589
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,707
if I knew it would happen to me,
I would've done things differently!

590
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:02,047
If I'm being too honest, my physical
desire will never be granted.

591
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:07,454
Why do I have to suffer so much?!

592
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:12,400
I'm a syphilis patient.

593
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,994
But that's not my fault.

594
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,335
My desire has nothing
to do with it, either.

595
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:22,944
My desire doesn't know
anything yet.

596
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,910
It's still pure.

597
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,275
It sometimes screams.

598
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:40,886
But...

599
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:45,766
I have this conscience...

600
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,897
I have this moral conscience...

601
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,630
trying to kill all of my desire.

602
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,275
My conscience
is killing my desire!

603
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:04,911
I want to destroy this conscience
and live as my desire wishes.

604
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,182
That's honest
as a human, right?

605
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:14,885
I'm just a fool pretending
that I don't have a desire.

606
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:19,028
I'm just sentimental now.

607
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:27,099
Misao is a woman with a future.

608
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,171
She has a body with a future.

609
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,840
I've been longing to have
that body for six years!

610
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:39,414
Why do I have to see quietly
as she becomes someone else's!

611
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:49,595
It's not too late.

612
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:52,627
I can still get Misao.

613
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:56,263
Right, Miss Minegishi?

614
01:17:57,372 --> 01:18:00,466
I'm right,
aren't I, Miss Minegishi?

615
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:51,014
I'm sorry I told you
embarrassing things.

616
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,175
I'm a doctor.

617
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:11,341
I have to live...

618
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:15,082
with a doctor's conscience
and a man's conscience.

619
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,756
It's very hard.

620
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,764
But, Doctor...

621
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:40,535
if somebody wants
to satisfy your desire...

622
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,203
If somebody put herself
in that position...

623
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,246
what would you do?

624
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,545
If there was a woman
who didn't care about your disease.

625
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,185
What does it mean?

626
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:58,582
I decided not to have
a husband at all.

627
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:04,365
I'm thinking of putting myself
in that position.

628
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:09,366
Are you trying
to be a hypocrite?

629
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,137
Don't say such a thing.

630
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:19,341
I think I love you.

631
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:25,081
A hospital is a funny place.

632
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:30,984
I wonder why I can't say anything
in a businesslike manner.

633
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:37,857
Where is the record of the man
who had the operation?

634
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:49,168
He has a high fever.
I'll check on him. Get ready.

635
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,815
I need disinfectant.

636
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,375
I received a postcard
from Misao.

637
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:35,356
Really? Does she sound happy?

638
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:39,154
Yeah. It says Hakone in snow
is very beautiful.

639
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:45,063
Well, Miss Misao doesn't like
to lose, either.

640
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:49,863
She can always find
her happiness by herself.

641
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,838
Dripping with sweat, right?

642
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:14,221
I didn't know you were here.

643
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:20,300
- The doctor?
- He is here.

644
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:24,361
Please come in.
I didn't hear you come in here.

645
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:33,275
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!

646
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,415
Kyoji! Kyoji!

647
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,788
- Help me operate.
- Is she that bad?

648
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:42,880
- Yeah.
- But if it's an abortion...

649
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,449
It's not an abortion.
The fetus is dead already.

650
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:53,891
Ma'am, what is wrong with you?

651
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,267
I want to ride this car, too.

652
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:04,273
You can't play with it now.
Boy?

653
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:06,211
Hey, kid!

654
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:09,340
Doctor?

655
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:15,484
Mrs. Nakata, do you want to wait
for your husband to come?

656
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:22,223
I left him and don't mean
to go back to Nakata.

657
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:25,664
- But...
- Doctor?

658
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:28,635
Is Nakata...

659
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:32,697
causing you trouble
or something?

660
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:35,842
What kind?

661
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:38,743
Did he do something to you
during the war?

662
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:44,946
He said you were making up
the story about his disease.

663
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:49,814
But lately I started to believe...

664
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:53,292
the opposite
of whatever Nakata says.

665
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:57,962
We are a foolish couple.

666
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,695
<i>- Kyoji, we'd better hurry.</i>
- Yes.

667
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:47,344
Everything is done.

668
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,853
What happened to my baby?

669
01:24:57,892 --> 01:24:59,257
I knew it.

670
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:07,132
Can I see the baby?
Just once?

671
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:11,263
No, you can't!

672
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:17,903
But I...

673
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,846
I don't think
you should see the baby.

674
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:32,192
<i>Hey! Fujisaki!</i>

675
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:35,821
Hey!

676
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:43,599
Please give me a hand!

677
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:50,238
Are you drunk?

678
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,905
What's wrong
with being drunk?!

679
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:55,683
Hey! Fujisaki!

680
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,986
Please be quiet.
This is a hospital.

681
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,750
Hey, Fujisaki! Hey!

682
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:08,284
<i>Fujisaki! Fujisaki!</i>

683
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:17,797
Hey! You!

684
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:20,500
How could you
destroy my family?!

685
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,045
Because of you,
my family is messed up.

686
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:27,673
- Because you told her that.
- I...

687
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:33,779
Shut up! The world
is not what you think it is!

688
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:38,121
A cold man like you
never gets the hardship of humans!

689
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,127
<i>- You</i> don't understand it!
- What?!

690
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:45,097
While you were drinking,
your wife...

691
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:46,565
went through a lot!

692
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:52,732
What?! I heard you say
you would operate on my wife!

693
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:54,968
You'll be sorry if you do that!

694
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:58,237
Where is Akiko?!

695
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,645
I can't let you see her
like this!

696
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:05,285
Shut up! I'll see my wife!

697
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,218
Your wife needs to rest!

698
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:08,755
- As a doctor...
- Shut up!

699
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:12,149
Why are you giving me
a hard time?!

700
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,286
- You're giving me a hard time!
- What?!

701
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:17,998
You are the one
who criticized my child!

702
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:21,797
You are the one who told me
you got my disease from your finger!

703
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:27,030
<i>But you must be having</i>
<i>fun all the time.</i>

704
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,743
<i>What crap a doctor can tell!</i>

705
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:35,314
You! You gave the disease
to the doctor!

706
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:40,150
What a bitch!
A bad doctor and a bad nurse!

707
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,622
- Jerk!
- Miss Minegishi!

708
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:54,828
Asshole! Because of you,
the doctor's suffering so much!

709
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:57,769
It's not only the doctor!
You make your wife suffer, too!

710
01:27:57,839 --> 01:27:59,670
And your baby!

711
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:03,609
You should see
how your baby was born!

712
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:11,615
Stop it! Nakata!

713
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:15,349
You don't trust me?!
Then go to the examining room!

714
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:19,688
Let this jerk see
how his baby was born!

715
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,766
Mr. Nakata, don't!

716
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:18,041
Doctor, he...?

717
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:24,051
- He shouldn't have seen it.
- No. It was a matter of time.

718
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:27,458
The spirochete was already
eating up his brain.

719
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:49,049
Nakata. Nakata!

720
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:51,444
Hey!

721
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:26,814
How are you doing?

722
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,858
Okay. My body is doing fine.

723
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:41,633
But sometimes I feel
like I'm still having a baby.

724
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:49,570
<i>- Tell me, Miss Minegishi.</i>
- What?

725
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:51,578
Please tell me the truth.

726
01:30:55,883 --> 01:31:01,719
Am I going to end up
like Nakata?

727
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,723
That's ridiculous!

728
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:08,187
Don't be afraid of even
the worst spirochete.

729
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:15,727
If you continue
the treatment calmly...

730
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:18,738
orderly, and patiently,
you'll be fine.

731
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,832
Take for example the doctor.

732
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:27,012
Is it true?

733
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:32,581
Then I still have hope?

734
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:34,644
Of course you do!

735
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:38,022
You don't have children.

736
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:40,720
Your life has just started.

737
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:47,232
<i>I have a child, but I think</i>
<i>my life has just begun, too.</i>

738
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,770
<i>You can't walk looking down.</i>

739
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:54,831
You have to walk proudly
with your chin up high.

740
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:59,906
Well, that's what the doctor says.

741
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:13,593
You like the doctor, don't you?

742
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:27,000
Ms. Akimoto! Ms. Akimoto!
Could you help me?

743
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:28,336
<i>Okay.</i>

744
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:36,274
I know.
She must be the new nurse.

745
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:40,787
Yes. Minegishi is pretty strict.
She is giving her a tough time.

746
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:43,016
She is doing
what Ms. Imai did to her.

747
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:46,559
Hey, hey.

748
01:32:48,829 --> 01:32:53,425
Kid, your mom
is a great nurse now. Right?

749
01:32:57,271 --> 01:32:59,501
- Here.
- By the way...

750
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:03,340
do you know what the chief
says about your son?

751
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:08,872
He says there is a saint
among doctors sometimes.

752
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:11,612
A saint? My son is a saint?

753
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:14,780
- Right.
- I don't know about that.

754
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:19,719
He is just trying
to give hope back...

755
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:22,388
by the people who are
unhappier than he is.

756
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:31,636
If he had been happy,
he might have become a snob.

757
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:43,376
<i>Please help me, doctor.</i>

758
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:48,183
<i>I have four kids. Doctor...</i>

759
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:52,526
<i>will I be able</i>
<i>to go back to work someday?</i>

760
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:54,822
<i>Doctor.</i>

761
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:35,564
THE END

762
