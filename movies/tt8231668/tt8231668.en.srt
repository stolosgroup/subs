<i>When it comes
to grandparents,</i>

3
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,094
<i>it's always
this charming story of persistence,</i>

4
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,929
<i>how your grandparents got together.</i>

5
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,599
You ask your grandma,
"How'd you meet Grandpa?"

6
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,976
It's always, "I didn't like him at first,

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,563
but he kept turning up
and now we're together."

8
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:08,860
And no one ever asks Nana,
"Why didn't you like Grandpa?"

9
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,946
She'd be like,
"I'll tell you something,

10
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,615
he gave me a real creep vibe."

11
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,201
"Always looking at me, licking his lips."

12
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,162
"I didn't like it."
"He made me uncomfortable."

13
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,291
"But my husband died in the war,
and your grandpa kept showing up."

14
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,461
"Nine months later,
your uncle Ted was born."

15
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,464
There's a switch in women's brains.

16
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,675
We're like, "He must love me
if he keeps bothering me."

17
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,970
"He pulled my hair when I was little,
he obviously loves me."

18
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,722
Doesn't go the opposite way.

19
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,766
It's never rewarded for women.

20
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,560
Instantly,
you're in the creep zone as a girl.

21
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:46,022
You text a guy twice, it's like,
"Take it easy, psycho."

22
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,941
"What a fucking psycho."

23
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,276
<i>What a fucking psycho.</i>

You said you'd finish law school
and you didn't, Jack.

53
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,658
You said you'd open up
your own business, Jack, and you couldn't.

54
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,495
Let's get serious. You didn't even
finish the dishes this morning, Jack.

55
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,458
- You think you're smarter than me?
- It's "smarter than I," and I know I am.

56
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,712
That was great. Thank you.

57
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,672
What's so funny?

58
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,260
Well, you should list them off quicker.
Right? Like,

59
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,638
"Didn't finish law school,
didn't open a business."

60
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,974
"Couldn't even finish the dishes."
Rule of three, do it quickly.

61
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,728
And we say "Jack" like a billion times.
Is that like, a typo?

62
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,188
I think the joke is fine.

63
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,607
Hm. We're using the term "joke" liberally.

64
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,568
You're a stand-up, right? New to acting?

65
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,905
- No.
- You might be a little old for this.

66
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,823
- She's supposed to be 35.
- Hm. Yeah.

67
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,492
I'm 34, so...

68
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,701
Yeesh.

69
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,204
I think we're good.

70
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,872
- Thanks for coming in.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,165
- Okay...
- Thanks.

72
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,042
- Thanks so much.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,962
Thank you.

74
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,256
- All right, I just had an idea.
- Yeah?

75
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,134
What if we change the joke
to what she said?

76
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,471
That's good. I like it when you say it.
She was rude.

77
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,180
But you're right.

78
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,016
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

79
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,687
Oh my God! Andrea!

80
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,146
- Hi, Serrena.
- Hi!

81
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,858
- Hi.
- Oh, you sounded <i>so</i> good in there.

82
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,360
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

83
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,114
Give me a hug. So good to see you.

84
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,783
- So slumming it in TV?
- Oh my God.

85
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,660
<i>Know how there's always one girl</i>

86
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,329
<i>you never want to run into

87
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,498
Or whatever, you know?
Blah, blah.

88
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,292
Serrena Halstead, one of my faves!

89
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,293
- Hi!
- Bye, Andrea.

90
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,129
<i>Serrena and I moved to LA
around the same time.</i>

91
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,424
<i>When I started doing stand-up,
she got her break in acting.</i>

92
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,760
<i>And the girl booked everything,
like every show.</i>

93
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,430
<i>The way she talked
made me wanna rip my ears out.</i>

94
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,349
I mean, your kids on Insta? Adorbs.

95
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,894
- So sweet.
- You in the hot suit? Goals. Life goals.

96
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,356
<i>And I know it's not cool
for women to judge other women,</i>

97
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,191
<i>but whatever, we all do it.</i>

98
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,192
Hot Neighbor?

99
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,238
<i>I'm not perfect,
and she's annoying,</i>

100
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,532
<i>but,
this story isn't about her.</i>

101
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,034
I was terrible, Margot.

102
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:31,664
The network flew me first class
for a five-minute audition,

103
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,168
and I still bombed.
I'm gonna eat everything on this plane.

104
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm gonna chug a gallon of Cranapple
and chase it with a pound of cookies.

105
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,840
Wanna know the best part?

106
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,967
I've been at TSA for 45 minutes

107
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,304
because the woman in front of me
lost her boarding pass.

108
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:50,058
Between check-in and the metal detector,
she managed to lose it.

109
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,352
Here's an idea: get the app.

110
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,479
Or get a purse with a padlock on it,

111
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,647
or a fanny pack,
or don't leave the house.

112
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,151
You know what it should be?
If you hold up TSA, you're the terrorist.

113
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,652
Hey. You dropped this.

114
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,823
Oh, that is humbling.

115
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,745
<i>If I'm gonna start from
the beginning, I can honestly say that</i>

116
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,498
<i>the story was not
about love at first sight.</i>

117
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,918
<i>I thought he looked like
a manager at Brooks Brothers.</i>

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,006
Thank you.

119
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,090
Shit.

120
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,344
What? No, I dropped my, huh, pants.

121
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:30,390
<i>Flight 1212 to Los Angeles
now boarding. Flight 1212 now boarding.</i>

122
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,359
- Excuse me. May I please have...?
- No, you've already had three juices.

123
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,442
That's enough.

124
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,696
My God.

125
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,287
Hello.

126
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:59,794
"Scaled relative to the severity..."

127
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,757
Oh. Hi.

128
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,676
Proportionality.

129
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,473
Wait, nope. Wait, yes. Rasp-berry. The P.

130
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,600
- The hidden P. Thank you.
- Hidden P.

131
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,935
Hidden P.

132
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,979
- Oh.
- I'm Dennis, by the way.

133
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,814
I'm Andrea.

134
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,275
- Hi.
- Hey, Andrea. Nice to meet you.

135
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,736
Yeah. Yes, "and you."
Sorry, that's the way a person answers.

136
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,948
And nice to meet you.
And thank you for the boarding pass.

137
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,868
I don't know what kind of idiot
loses their boarding pass

138
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,078
a minute after getting it,
but that was ironic.

139
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,373
Airports have horrible effects on people.
Bring out the worst.

140
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,294
I feel like my worst is stuck on
a casting tape somewhere in Midtown.

141
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,256
Wait, you're a comedian, right?
Andrea Singer.

142
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,259
- No autographs.
- I've seen you before. Cool.

143
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,886
I'm sorry. I'm in a mood.

144
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,473
I had the worst audition of my life
and I feel like garbage.

145
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,933
Well, you know a career in show business

146
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,020
is an incredibly difficult thing
to accomplish, Andrea.

147
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,981
- Yes, Dennis, I do know that.
- You should be proud.

148
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,444
The ratio of self-proclaimed entertainers
to those who make a living entertaining,

149
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,113
I'd imagine to be
incredibly disproportionate.

150
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,491
Talk about proportionality.

151
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,285
This is a valid point.

152
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,456
And what do you do?

153
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,539
Hedge funds.

154
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,709
Is that fun?

155
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,630
It's like acting. You need people
to believe in you to sell your character.

156
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,716
I need people to believe
that I'd be capable with their money.

157
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,928
- Are you?
- Depends on how much I've had to drink.

158
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,054
No.

159
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,306
If you speak well
and went to a good school,

160
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,225
most people will give you their money.

161
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,851
What? No way.

162
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,188
Those are reasons
to not trust a person. I don't trust you.

163
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,271
Excellent decision.

164
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,233
Your comedic instincts
have served you well.

165
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,236
Oh, excuse me.

166
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,655
Hello?

167
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,659
<i>I don't usually talk to people
on planes, but he seemed nice,</i>

168
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,787
<i>normal, like an accountant
who loves missionary.</i>

169
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,164
Talk to you later. Bye. Love you.

170
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,211
- My girlfriend, Cassandra. She's a model.
- Wow. Slipping that right in.

171
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,464
She can't see me later
because her shoot got moved.

172
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,800
- Again.
- Hate when that happens.

173
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,349
- Something to drink?
- Oh, whiskey neat.

174
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:22,019
If you have Blue Label, I'll take it.
If not, pour it and don't tell me.

175
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,106
- Andrea?
- Cranapple. Juice.

176
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,607
Got it.

177
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,778
Not drinking before 5:00, huh?
Some comic you are.

178
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,616
- So you got a husband or a boyfriend?
- Oh, wow. Seamless transition.

179
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,078
Um, I have a guy that I asked
to pick me up from the airport.

180
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,622
So, we'll see if <i>Cayden</i>
can clear his schedule.

181
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,418
Cayden. Sounds like a stimulating
conversationalist, <i>Cayden.</i>

182
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:49,297
Yeah, a formidable opponent
to a model named Cassandra, I'm sure.

183
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,757
- Fair play.
- Mm-hm.

184
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,803
- So when's your next stand-up gig?
- Uh, it's tonight at The Comedy Store.

185
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,305
Aww, drats, tonight?

186
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,807
I got this Yale alumni event
I have to go to.

187
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,394
- What's a Yale?
- Oh, Yale is a prestigious school...

188
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,687
I'm fucking with you.

189
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,606
I know what Yale is.

190
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,900
My cousin, Brett Korchran, went.
You're like the same age. Know him?

191
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,527
It does sound familiar.

192
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,195
Um, pretty big school.

193
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,407
Plus I spent most of my time
golfing and drinking, so...

194
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,369
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

195
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,663
- This is for you.
- Wow, whole thing.

196
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,501
Okay. So where were we
on your crossword puzzle?

197
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,295
Oh, okay. Um...

198
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,214
And it's difficult
to meet a normal guy.

199
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,925
I'm already labeled too strong as it is.

200
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,219
But why? What about this is so strong?

201
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,222
Because I'm not walking
down the street falling over,

202
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,975
calling myself a hot mess on Instagram?

203
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:48,648
Because I'm not checking my horoscope
for life advice, I'm intimidating?

204
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,731
You are.

205
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,775
I'm intimidating?

206
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,777
What's more intimidating to you, sir?

207
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,907
Me, as is, or like the idea
of totally shaving your neck beard?

208
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,116
Does that scare you?

209
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,452
"But then they'll know."
"I'll be vulnerable."

210
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,996
Welcome to being a woman
and doing anything ever.

218
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,588
What is with your energy tonight?

219
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,548
Pfft.

220
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,718
You should be at the club networking
and rubbing dicks with writers,

221
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,303
not moping in my bar
putting off a shit vibe.

222
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,890
I don't want to network.
I like you. I like your bar.

223
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,059
I like being shitty in your bar.

224
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,229
- Here, Andrea. It's on me.
- Thank you.

225
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,734
He is so hot it makes me nauseous.

226
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,027
- He sucks. I'm gonna fire him.
- There's that.

227
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,030
Girl, you need to change up
the way that you operate.

228
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,951
Stop being so salty about
all the things that are coming your way.

229
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,287
You know what I always
respected about you?

230
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,622
You weren't obsessed with marriage.

231
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:33,169
It was okay that you hadn't reached
all your goals by the age of 35.

232
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,838
Wow, that compliment
started great and just...

233
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,883
I'm saying you're okay.

234
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,051
You're also saying that I'm 35.

235
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,179
- Yeah?
- I'm 34.

236
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,972
Really? Because you look 35.

237
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,056
A salty 35.

238
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,869
- Bite your tongue.
- I always speak the truth.

239
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,645
- You speak the truth because you're drunk.
- Affirmative.

240
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,357
Thank you, Captain.
Whatever you want to call yourself.

241
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,526
Rear Admiral.
Love you. I'm going to my show.

242
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,198
...and they weren't even there.

243
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,575
Thank you.
That's my time. Have a great night.

244
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,619
Thank you.

245
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,662
That's all for me tonight.

246
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,256
- Hey.
- Ahh!

247
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,968
- Sorry. I'm used to that from women.
- No. Sorr... No... Um...

248
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,554
- Dennis.
- Yeah! Dennis from the plane.

249
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,223
- You're here.
- You invited me.

250
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,141
- I... I did.
- Right.

251
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,393
I invite a lot of people.
They rarely come.

252
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,145
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

253
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,523
- Hey.
- Welcome. Uh, is your girlfriend here?

254
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,942
Cassandra, her shoot went late tonight.

255
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,654
She'd love to grab a drink after.
In the meantime, can I buy you a drink?

256
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,783
- Okay, sure. Margot's on Sunset.
- Great.

257
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,535
How's um...

258
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,829
- How's Cayden?
- I date a lot of Caydens.

259
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,497
- You'll have to be specific.
- Okay...

260
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,083
Andrea, I'm telling you,

261
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,461
until Giles, he throws
a wad of money at this guy,

262
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,089
and he goes, "Who cares?"
"I'll take both."

263
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,968
Oh no, dude, that seems impossible.

264
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,346
Oh! My girlfriend has officially
stood me up. Great.

265
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,307
Really? Could've told you an hour ago.

266
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,686
To having it all
and wishing there was more.

267
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,104
- Okay.
- All right.

268
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,939
- Cheers.
- Weird toast.

269
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,108
Mm. Oh, wow.

270
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,985
Breug. Impressive.

271
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,653
- Thanks for noticing.
- Mm.

272
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,738
My father and I
spent our last Christmas together

273
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,157
on a tour
of the Jameson Distillery in Ireland.

274
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,076
- Aww.
- Oh man, that's so sad.

275
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,327
Yeah.

276
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,497
- So Andrea said you work in hedge funds.
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,332
I like to dabble in stocks.

278
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,210
I got this tip
that One World Communications...

279
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,672
You don't want it. It has the markings
of a successful company,

280
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,508
but the underwriters are scum.
It's just to save face.

281
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,052
<i>Something about him,
he was charming.</i>

282
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,015
<i>I had never seen someone be
simultaneously pompous and humble.</i>

283
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,935
<i>He was also definitely
a low-key functioning alcoholic.</i>

284
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,690
Um, but I can send you a couple ideas
my buddies and I are tossing around.

285
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,983
- Are you sure?
- I...

286
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,611
- I think so. I think so.
- Okay.

287
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,279
- Pretty sure.
- I guess so.

288
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,449
Whoa!

289
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,116
Where do you live?

290
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,287
I'm in the middle of buying a place.
In Beverly Hills.

291
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,330
Oh, that's cool.

292
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,626
Pfft!

293
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,880
- It's my "fuck you" billboard.
- That one?

294
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,716
Yeah, it's just... it's the best billboard.

295
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,261
It's in the middle of Hollywood,
and it's parallel to the street.

296
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,598
No matter which direction
you're driving, you see it.

297
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:37,144
And it's like you get that billboard
and everybody knows who you are, right?

298
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,189
- I'm gonna get that billboard.
- I can picture it.

299
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,696
Am I always in the wrong place or are they
on the wrong side of the street?

300
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,033
- I doubt very much that it's you.
- All right. Have a good night.

301
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,578
Tell Cassandra
that she missed a drunken time.

302
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,871
- Will do.
- Goodnight.

303
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,955
All right.

304
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,750
- Goodnight!
- Okay.

305
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,048
How about that?

306
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,053
<i>I never got to meet Cassandra.
He stopped bringing her up.</i>

307
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,514
<i>I'd assumed she sucked,
or she dumped him</i>

308
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:17,393
<i>and he didn't want to talk about it.
We started hanging out more.</i>

309
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,189
<i>I was happy to have a friend
besides Margot I could be myself around.</i>

310
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,417
There are good and bad ships,
the best are friendships.

311
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,193
Impressive.

312
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,611
Cheers.

313
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,030
<i>He wasn't like the guys
I'd met in LA.</i>

314
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,659
<i>He was more elegant
and refined and unfamiliar,</i>

315
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,996
<i>almost exotic.
If something really white can be exotic.</i>

316
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,999
Oh<i>,</i> yeah. These are great.

317
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,418
<i>I'm a comic
so I keep weird hours.</i>

318
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,877
Go ahead and take these...

319
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,381
<i>It's hard to find friends
as sporadically available as I am.</i>

320
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,967
<i>And he was so patient with me.</i>

321
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,929
"The good kind from the good place.
You know."

322
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,713
<i>Maybe Margot had given me
good advice for once.</i>

323
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,309
<i>Maybe I needed to change
the way I operated.</i>

324
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,603
<i>The more time I spent with Dennis,
the better I felt.</i>

325
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,647
<i>We were hanging out all the time.</i>

326
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,484
But through it all,
I was always right here.

327
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,612
- Are you Australian or British?
- Neither.

328
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,364
Okay, and in the description,

329
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,783
it says be sweet,
like a Serrena Halstead type.

330
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,618
Then they can just hire her.

331
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,414
<i>We always had fun together.</i>

332
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,876
<i>We enjoyed each other.</i>

333
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,337
<i>However, to say that I wasn't
physically attracted to him</i>

334
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,173
<i>was an understatement.</i>

335
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,135
<i>It's not that he was ugly per se.</i>

336
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,013
<i>He had a charm to him,
when his clothes were on.</i>

337
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,141
<i>Ugh. I'm losing you.
How can I be nice about this?</i>

338
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,145
<i>He was tall
and not out of shape, not in shape.</i>

339
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,190
<i>He just wasn't,
I don't know, great looking.</i>

340
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,610
<i>Come on... That may sound harsh,
but men judge women</i>

341
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,154
<i>by those same standards every second.</i>

342
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,157
<i>What I liked about Dennis was Dennis.</i>

343
00:17:55,824 --> 00:18:00,079
<i>You couldn't put a label on us.
We were friends. Just friends.</i>

344
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,418
What's this show about?

345
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,838
- You hated it.
- No, no. I'm just trying to understand.

346
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,048
Okay.

347
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,343
It's about a cadet.
She's a human, but she lies her way

348
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,472
into an alien space academy,
and she ends up being the best one there.

349
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,934
So it's like a fish-out-of-water
underdog story.

350
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,520
- Also, I was fighting in space.
- Ah.

351
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,397
Hence the slow-motion fighting.
Makes perfect sense.

352
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,650
The show is called<i> Space Cadet.</i>

353
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,610
Hm. So somebody wrote this

354
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,862
and sold it to people
who thought it was a good idea?

355
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,740
- Yeah, picked it up for 30 episodes.
- Wow.

356
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,326
I know it's lame, but I really want it.

357
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,411
If I got it, it would be a game changer.

358
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,998
I would move to Vancouver
for five months to shoot this.

359
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,877
I could get off the road
and just be around other actors

360
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,004
and create something concrete.

361
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,924
I wouldn't be so alone.
It would just be so awesome.

362
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,468
Could we do it once more?
I won't keep you here all night.

363
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,096
Yeah. I can't stay that long.
I have a date.

364
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,598
Oh, that's great. Awesome. Me too.

365
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,809
We'll get you out of here.
We'll just do it again.

366
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,563
And honestly, Dennis, thank you.
Thank you for doing this.

367
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,815
Absolutely. Okay, take two.

368
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,109
<i>Tough question.</i>

369
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,821
Is it okay to hang out with a guy

370
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,032
full well knowing
you don't intend to sleep with him?

371
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,159
No.

372
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,994
- No way.
- You're saying it's wrong.

373
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,164
But it's all guys.
They're like, "I'm rock hard now."

374
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,874
"What am I supposed to do now?"

375
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,961
One girl in the back who's terrified,
she's like, "It's okay to do it."

376
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,754
It is okay.

377
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,341
Because by that same token,
so many dudes will date girls,

378
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,469
no intention of marrying them.
Happy to waste your time.

379
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,931
I feel that if you have an agreement,
if you've been honest, you're like,

380
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,517
"I never want to see you naked,
and I'm not into it,"

381
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,270
and he still wants to hang out with you?

382
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,980
We're all adults here, right?

383
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,232
As long as you're honest, that's fair.

384
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,776
Then one night, all bets are off,
you get super drunk.

385
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,862
Like, "I'll make out with you."

386
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,823
Turns out he was a good kisser,
but you're still conflicted.

387
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,287
Thanks for making me look good
on our first date.

388
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,915
It was the only thing
I was concerned about,

389
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,625
not that terrible audience.

390
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,836
We got reservations. What are y'all up to?

391
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,547
There's this restaurant,
a friend's restaurant<i>.</i>

392
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,008
- He bought it...?
- I was at this Yale alumni dinner.

393
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,344
One of the guys is an investor
and was begging us to go.

394
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,261
Have to go.

395
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,888
- I gotta go.
- It's his friend. Ow.

396
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,139
Hey.

397
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,225
- You were that chick on stage.
- Yeah.

398
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,268
Pretty funny for a girl.

399
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,146
There it is.
Cool cut and paste job from Reddit.

400
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,315
- Thanks for coming.
- Get the fuck out of here.

401
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,400
- Let's just go.
- You're so tough.

402
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,278
- Make me, tough girl.
- Is there a problem, sir?

403
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,031
- There's about to be.
- Whoa. You know what?

404
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,701
You got a boyfriend,
and now you feel like you're funny.

405
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,912
- He's not my boyfriend. Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

406
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,290
- What is your issue?
- You wanna go? You wanna fucking go?

407
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,209
- Margot! Stop.
- I'll fight. I love to fight!

408
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,419
You don't think I have a black belt?

409
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,255
That was not cool.

410
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,673
God, every night.

411
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,717
- I ate the whole thing.
- Anything else?

412
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,803
- We're all finished. Check please.
- Sure.

413
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,305
Mm. I'm gonna keep mine because I'm a pig.

414
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,765
Very good.

415
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,935
I'm sorry about that back there.

416
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,980
People go to comedy clubs, get drunk
and forget how to act,

417
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,314
or that I'm a person.

418
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,276
I want you to be my girlfriend.

419
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,155
- Dennis...
- I've thought about this.

420
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,408
I make an excellent complement
to your life.

421
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,909
I won't see anyone else,

422
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,162
and I think you should stop seeing
other fellows and just be with me.

423
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,624
- I made a list of pros and cons.
- You made a spreadsheet?

424
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,252
- So?
- Dennis, I am not there.

425
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,795
- Yet.
- At all.

426
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,340
I know you better
than you know yourself at this point.

427
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,343
I'm not giving up having you
because you're too dense to see

428
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,553
I'm perfect for you.

429
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,596
You don't get to decide
what's better for me

430
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,099
- because you think you're smarter than I...
- "Than me."

431
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,059
It's "smarter than I."

432
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,811
And you're not always.

433
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:57,149
Perhaps not, but I'm better quality
than the other guys you date.

434
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,692
The last guy you went out with,

435
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,236
didn't even come to the door
when he picked you up.

436
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,530
He couldn't just leave
his bicycle in the street.

437
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,365
I know I can make you happy.

438
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,327
I'm good for you, and I got you a gift.

439
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,829
Dennis, no, I can't accept a gift.

440
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,332
Fortunately, you won't have to right now.

441
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,295
When I went to Cartier
to pick up your bracelet...

442
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,210
- What?
- ...they made a mistake on the metal,

443
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,254
but it is being fixed.

444
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,424
If I want an expensive bracelet,
I'll buy it myself,

445
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,550
or a good knockoff.

446
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,637
Which is what's so great about you.
You can do everything for yourself.

447
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,724
You put yourself through college,
built a career on nothing.

448
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,309
Yeah, and it shows.

449
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,103
You are so witty, and it is so sexy.

450
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,732
If I can just do a little for you,
I feel like I'm a part of your life.

451
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,358
You're exquisite.

452
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,488
Thank you.

453
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,031
Oh, you have a little...

454
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,532
- Fuck.
- That's okay.

455
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,910
- Let me see.
- I am so sorry.

456
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,787
Let me guess. My card.

457
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,874
My Deutsche Bank card I use in Europe.
I usually tell the bank I'm back.

458
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,834
- Use this.
- Take this.

459
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,630
Do not fight me. Otherwise,
I'll cry and make a very big scene.

460
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,090
You heard the woman.

461
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,012
Thank you.

462
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,725
How was the rest of your date?

463
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,729
Oh, I'm not gonna see her again.
Something just wasn't there.

464
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,400
Yeah, I get it. Dennis asked me
to be his girlfriend. Woof.

465
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,112
- Oh. Well, that's that.
- We're still friends. We'll hang out.

466
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,073
Why? If you keep hanging out with him,
he'll think he has a chance.

467
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,617
I'm just hanging out with Dennis.
He goes on dates.

468
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,411
When? You're always together.

469
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,413
I don't know, and I don't care.

470
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,374
I'm allowed to go out with any guy
and hang out with Dennis,

471
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:41,128
as long as I'm being honest about it.
That's fair. That's feminism.

472
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,712
Oh, don't start that.

473
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,916
Don't say it's feminism just because
you're doing something I don't agree with.

474
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,175
Pfft! Hold on.

475
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,219
It's my agent. Hello? Yeah.

476
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,557
Okay. Thank you. I'll call you back.

477
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,435
- I got the part.
- You got the part!

478
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,228
I got the<i> Space Cadet </i>show!

479
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,398
Oh my God! Oh my God!

480
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,315
Nine years!

481
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,568
- Nine years of auditioning! Fuck yeah!
- Woo!

482
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,528
Somebody finally wants me!

483
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,989
Ahh! Oh my... Hold on. It's Dennis.

484
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,575
I'm putting you on speaker.
I got the part!

485
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,160
<i>Off the audition tape I helped with?</i>

486
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,244
Fuck yes.

487
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,788
I get to move to Vancouver.
I'm gonna be a star!

488
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,332
<i>- Guess we're going to Vancouver.</i>
- What?

489
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,919
<i>I guess you're going to Vancouver.
Sorry, the phone is weird.</i>

490
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,464
Call me back
when you have better reception.

491
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,175
<i>- </i>This is annoying.
<i>- Let's celebrate. How about Friday?</i>

492
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,719
Um, Friday I can't, because...

493
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,805
because I have a date, buddy.

494
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,640
- So hot. Dennis?
- That's good.

495
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,850
I think I lost him.

496
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,269
- Who cares? I got the part!
- Yeah!

497
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,694
Blue Label neat for the lady.

498
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,113
- Thanks.
- Never pegged you as a whiskey gal.

499
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,533
- Yeah, I didn't used to be.
- And here you go.

500
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,368
Oh my God.

501
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,622
- I thought I ordered a vodka drink.
- That's what it is.

502
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:02,459
Can you put your giant arm
right in front of this, <i>please?</i>

503
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,669
- Let me just objectify you.
- Come on.

504
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,755
Now flex it. Show the definition.

505
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,798
The drink is pretty.
It makes you look pretty.

506
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,675
Don't you wanna be pretty?
Can I post this?

507
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,928
Only reason I'm letting you
is because you're cute.

508
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,887
Thank you.

509
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,557
Uh, can I get another vodka drink
that's not this?

510
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,558
Mm-hm.

511
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,062
One second. Hi.

512
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,316
No, you're not bothering me.

513
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,277
What's wrong?

514
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,991
Here. Here. Here

515
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,742
Oh.

516
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,832
- They caught it early, right?
- They're still running tests.

517
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,421
- What kind of cancer does your mom have?
- It's got some...

518
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,592
Some weird name like crane... Cranio...

519
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,261
- Craniopharyngioma.
- ...pharyngioma?

520
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:58,223
- Yeah. How did you know that?
- Sorry, I don't mean to be smiling.

521
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,852
Um, I was a nurse on an ABC show
about medical disorders.

522
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,022
- It was called<i> Special Med.</i>
- No.

523
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,107
It's horrible.

524
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,693
That's pretty bad.

525
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,573
You always know how to brighten my day.
Can't believe I'm crying in front of you.

526
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:19,035
You know, my family never shows emotion
being Irish Catholic, you know.

527
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,580
I don't. I'm Jewish.

528
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,457
We are very clear about our emotions.

529
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,541
That's right.

530
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,837
This is silly.

531
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,050
I know you were out on a date tonight.
And I'm just gonna go.

532
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,303
No! No, just...

533
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,804
- I should...
- Just sit.

534
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,306
Stay.

535
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,392
You're always there for me.

536
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,645
Like anytime I call you,
or I want to go out,

537
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,774
or I just need someone to talk to,
or my stupid endless fucking auditions.

538
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,861
You are <i>such</i> a good friend.
And I don't tell you that enough.

539
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,114
And... And I don't have the money
like you have,

540
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,159
or the<i> Downton Abbey </i>old-world advice,

541
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,704
but I know how to have a good time,
and that is what I can do for you.

542
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,039
Drink this, eat this.

543
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,750
Well, I don't think we should... Wow.

544
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,713
Get on my level.
Otherwise, I'll be drunk,

545
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,132
and I'll go out partying
and leave you here.

546
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,926
- Good. Yeah. Eat this.
- Eat the whole mushroom?

547
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,470
God, no. Not the whole thing.

548
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,222
Thought you said you went to college.
Little bit. Come on.

549
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,806
Mm.

550
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,516
Oof.

551
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,144
We're going Downtown.

00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,462
<i>but in that moment,
I didn't want to be with anyone but him.</i>

577
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,589
Hey.

578
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,672
Hi.

579
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,969
I wanna be your girlfriend.

580
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,221
Absolutely.

581
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,190
I kind of feel guilty.

582
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,359
Why? Because you work out
but you have no upper arm strength?

583
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,363
No. Because after a decade of struggling,

584
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,825
I finally have a real gig,
I have nothing to complain about,

585
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,619
I have a normal boyfriend.

586
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,870
He ain't normal.

587
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,498
- Ahh!
- You sound like a bird.

588
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,251
Andrea, up here.
Look, like this. Watch.

589
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,922
Hi-jah!

590
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,507
Hm-suup!

591
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,053
Who the fuck is she bowing to?

592
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,306
Oh! And congrats, mama, on<i> Space Cadet.</i>

593
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,767
I read for it too, but the studio
thought it was a conflict

594
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,770
with this dark, dramatic, intense role
I'm doing, so...

595
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,853
Uh-huh.

596
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:19,234
- Did she just call me mama?
- You haven't been dating him long enough.

597
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,069
Can't see any of the cracks.

598
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,613
You don't really know anything about him.

599
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,407
You know that his mom is sick
and he went to Yale.

600
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,911
And you ever notice he always
has the perfect answer for everything?

601
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,706
So you don't like him because he's smart?
What is with all your questions?

602
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,625
- Yah!
- Yahh!

603
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,086
Good job! Way to find your inner warrior!

604
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,715
Woo!

605
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,595
- Did you stretch?
- I always stretch. I'm a premier athlete.

606
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,560
Gotta cool down. Can't just go right back
into the world with a hot body.

607
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,727
I never stretch.

608
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,439
Did you get a new car?

609
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,442
I drove you here.
You're just now noticing?

610
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,028
What kind of horsepower we working with?

611
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,282
I don't care. I'm taking Dennis
to Santa Barbara this weekend.

612
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,201
- What is the mpg? Or is it electric?
- Stop talking about the car.

613
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,721
He's going to meet my family.
He's gonna meet my cousin Brett.

614
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,746
That's a big step.

615
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,373
- It's a big step.
- Yeah.

616
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,126
Oh, what are these?

617
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,796
Andrea, these are freaking nice.

618
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,048
They were $500.

619
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,593
- What?
- Got them this morning. They're Baccarat.

620
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:31,014
Dennis told me his dad used to drink
whiskey out of these tumblers.

621
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,181
But $500?

622
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,351
It's the kind of gift he'd get me,
but I got it for him first.

623
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,479
Will you come with me
to his apartment to drop them off?

624
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,649
- Say yes.
- I thought he bought a house months ago.

625
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,861
Oh, he did. He hasn't moved in yet.
The contractor's been weird.

626
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,070
It's a nightmare.

627
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,657
You haven't been to his apartment,
but he's been inside <i>you?</i>

628
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,285
His apartment's cramped.
He uses it for sleep and storage.

629
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,913
- He's always at my place.
- Okay. Fine.

630
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,998
Why don't we just go there right now?

631
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,333
We'll surprise him.

632
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,419
We won't call, so he can't not be there.

633
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,421
It'll be fun. Let's go. ASAP.

634
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,923
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

635
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,716
- Great. Awesome.
- Okay.

636
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,136
He said it's on Vista and it's white.

637
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,765
Or the apartment's green.
Or did he say brick?

638
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,726
- We'll find it. Let's go.
- Okay. Great.

639
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,355
2005 Vista.

640
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,275
This cannot be it.

641
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,197
I thought it was an apartment.

642
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,617
- There's just no one.
- Here.

643
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,585
- Shh. Shh.
- What? Are we tracking a bear?

644
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,755
- Shh.
- Did you just eat dirt?

645
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,673
Shh.

646
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,050
Follow me.

647
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,760
- Can you act like a person?
- Shh.

648
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,431
- Don't snoop in the window.
- We might be at the wrong house.

649
00:32:56,015 --> 00:33:00,395
Snoop fast. Look for preppy things
like mallards or plaid wallpaper.

650
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,189
- Oh my God. You're Andrea.
- Incoming!

651
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,318
Andrea? This is so exciting. Hi.

652
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,656
And you are Dennis's mistresses?

653
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,660
What? No, we're his roommates.
My name is Maggie, and this is...

654
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,743
Leslie.

655
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,580
It's so great to finally meet you.

656
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,664
Is it?

657
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,167
Hi, I'm Margot.

658
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,170
- Hi.
- She's not my girlfriend.

659
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,423
- Hi.
- Hi.

660
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,551
- Dude, help me.
- Oh! Um.

661
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,220
Uh, we just have a gift for Dennis.

662
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,055
Oh, you can just leave it with us.

663
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,223
- Great.
- Great.

664
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,350
- Great.
- Grand.

665
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,018
Oh.

666
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,940
This was so much fun. Thank you so much.

667
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,983
Okay.

668
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,530
What the fuck was that?

669
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,408
Who the fuck are those girls, Dennis?

670
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,369
- <i>I'm not doing this with you.</i>
- Not doing what?

671
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,372
Telling me why you have roommates?
Why do <i>you</i> need roommates?

672
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,499
Yeah, why do you have a hot roommate?

673
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,127
<i>I'm not standing for this scrutiny.
Goodbye.</i>

674
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,337
- Did he hang up on me?
- Did he hang up?

675
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,632
Oh, I knew that dude was weird.
Now it's confirmed.

676
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,968
No, he does not talk to me this way.

677
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,680
Maybe his mom just died,
and then I called and handled it wrong.

678
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,890
Handled it wrong?

679
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,727
You bought homeboy $500 cups
and found out he has a roommate,

680
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,228
who's not ugly by the way.

681
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,712
Wait, are you saying that
because you want to sleep with her,

682
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,858
or trying to plant it in my head
that he's cheating?

683
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,611
I meant for me. You know
he's not sleeping with anybody else.

684
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,614
- I don't know that.
- Oh God, he's so ugly.

685
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,115
- You think all guys are ugly.
- So?

686
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,451
You're biased. That's what's so.

687
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,999
- You packed and ready?
- Are you insane?

688
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,168
- What?
- You're gonna act like nothing happened?

689
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,546
I'm not spending
the weekend with you after that.

690
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,342
- Darling, you're making this hard.
- Can you not call me darling?

691
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,929
Can you not talk to me like
I'm your WASP-y wife of 50 years, darling?

692
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,182
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing that was

693
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:05,603
to meet two women that you live with
who you didn't tell me about?

694
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,689
You're right.

695
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,026
Okay.

696
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,904
So I lied to you about my house.

697
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,323
I have it. I've had it for a long time.

698
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,327
But you decorated it weird,
don't want me to see?

699
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,246
Bad wallpaper, weird plumbing?

700
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,747
No.

701
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,583
See, my mother...

702
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,670
Okay. Just come in. Just come on.

703
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,255
<i>I moved my mother in.</i>

704
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,925
I don't want to be a grown man
living with his mother,

705
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,718
but it's the best way to take care of her.

706
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,138
- I need to be there for her.
- Of course.

707
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,891
She doesn't want to feel like a patient,
so I leave the house for her.

708
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,476
Saying this, it sounds insane.

709
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,895
No. No, I get it.

710
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,799
Maggie's a friend from Yale,
forever struggling with money.

711
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,402
She's never really had any success.
Not like you or us.

712
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,738
I pay her to keep my stuff there.
I'm helping a friend out.

713
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,617
She's making my life easier.
I'm so sorry she didn't explain herself.

714
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,703
And Leslie, Leslie is...

715
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,496
she's weird.

716
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,914
Very weird.

717
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:11,252
I'm sorry that I was emotionally immature
and I wasn't just honest with you.

718
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,753
I'm an absolute idiot.

719
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,299
No. No, it's all right.

720
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:22,305
Maybe now that your mom
is here permanently, um,

721
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,433
- I could meet her, because I...
- She would love that.

722
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,517
- Really?
- Yes.

723
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,144
- I could bring her flowers.
- Yeah.

724
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,396
I could finally see your house.
So where is it?

725
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,689
Beverly Hills.

726
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,816
- But like where?
- Around Doheny.

727
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,277
- So it's like more West Hollywood.
- No, Beverly Hills.

728
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,070
But where is it specifically?

729
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,364
- Doheny and Santa Monica.
- That's West Hollywood.

730
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,201
- Palm, 1360 Palm Avenue.
- Oh.

731
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,286
Beverly Hills, I assure you.

732
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,371
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.

733
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,498
- Let's go. We'll drop in right now.
- Really?

734
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,625
- Yeah.
- I'm so excited.

735
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,978
She's usually awake right now.
If not, we can wake her up.

736
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,880
She'll wanna put out tea,
the whole thing. She loves formalities.

737
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,299
No. I don't want to barge in
on a sick woman.

738
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,802
Hey. She'll understand that I love you,
and this is important to you.

739
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,139
Your needs come first.
The traffic's gonna get hard. Let's go.

740
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,977
No, stop. I'm not just some spoiled brat
who just barges in on your sick mom.

741
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,687
We'll go after the trip.

742
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,482
- Plus traffic's probably bad.
- You're right.

743
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,818
Now that this is all settled,
will you please go pack?

744
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,529
- Oh, I've <i>been</i> packed.
- What?

745
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:24,492
I packed a while ago. I just wanted to see
how you were gonna handle this.

746
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,910
God, I love you.

747
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,789
- Gonna put this in the car.
- Okay.

748
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,250
Wait. Dennis...

749
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,505
did you get the tumblers?

750
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,509
Yes. Thank you so much. They're beautiful.

751
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,637
- Just like the ones your dad had?
- Absolutely.

752
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,765
Mm.

753
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,726
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey, are you near Dennis?</i>

754
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,853
No. What's up?

755
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,356
Before I tell you this.
I want you to know I love you,

756
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,400
and I just want you to be happy.

757
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,526
Duh.

758
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,779
<i>- So I called the Yale Registrar.
- </i>Why?

759
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,616
The last Dennis Kelly
graduated in 1980 and didn't play golf,

760
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,785
but he was indicted for fraud.

761
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,453
Stop. Okay, sorry.

762
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,541
Um, I love you. And yes, I will admit
this whole thing is very weird,

763
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,377
and the house stuff is weird,
but he explained himself.

764
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,712
<i>He did? How?</i>

765
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,674
It's got to do with his mom,
and it's this really sweet endeavor.

766
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,883
- Hey, babe.
- Ahh!

767
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,801
Are you okay?

768
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,136
- You ready?
- Yes.

769
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,429
Yes.

770
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,763
Call you back.

771
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,724
- Let's go.
- Okay, now?

772
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,807
- Yeah.
- Okay.

773
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,573
Think we put our bags here.

774
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,118
Thank you.

775
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,246
This is nice.
This place had great Yelp reviews.

776
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,457
What's your cousin's name again?

777
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,876
Goes by Dr. Korchran, but it's Brett.

778
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,711
He went to Yale.
I told you about him.

779
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,671
And he's kind of a bro. Hey.

780
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,510
- D-Dog. Fuck yeah!
- Hey. Oh!

781
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,511
Hey, hey.

782
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,139
- Go Bulldogs.
- Ah.

783
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,849
- Nice to meet you.
- Fuck yeah, dude.

784
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,410
- Fellow Bulldog in the house.
- Right?

785
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,270
So great to meet you.
Andrea fucking loves you.

786
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,480
Brett, are you ten?

787
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,899
- Oh, this is Alli.
- Hi.

788
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:20,982
Hi.

789
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,445
What do you guys want to do?
We could go wine tasting like old people,

790
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,571
or we could hit the bar.

791
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,698
- Wow. He's a doctor?
- Mm-hm.

792
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,451
Actually, I have a surprise for us.

793
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,997
Uh, I got us golf.
I bought us a round of golf!

794
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,500
Cuz, this is a beautiful course.
I could've chipped in.

795
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,377
No way, I've got that TV money.

796
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,545
Plus I wanted it to be a surprise.

797
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,298
Absolutely. So sweet, babe.

798
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,217
Alli, I don't like golf,

799
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,261
so I went ahead and got us
mini champagne and Doritos!

800
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,931
- Woo! I love golf.
- I love golf too!

801
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,682
- Let's check in.
- Let's do it.

802
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,143
Hang on.

803
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,271
That was really smooth.

804
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,981
Andrea said you played at Yale.

805
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,274
- What year were you?
- '05.

806
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,944
Oh, okay. I'm '07. I knew some golf dudes.

807
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,195
I didn't play for Yale.

808
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,656
- What?
<i>- At </i>Yale, on the club team.

809
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,283
- I don't remember the club team.
- We weren't a proud bunch.

810
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,743
Hard to brag about a handicap

811
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,703
when to the real team,
you look handicapped.

812
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,206
Man,
that's pretty ableist, bro.

813
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,166
So, what college were you in?

814
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,543
Yale, dude.

815
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,005
This guy's hilarious. I was at Davenport.

816
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,383
- I was in JE.
- Yeah, but they suck.

817
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,718
Me too. And they do suck.

818
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,762
Ha-hah! I knew I liked this guy.

819
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,140
I think I remember
the club team now.

820
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,058
Man, they <i>sucked.</i>

821
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,228
Totally. I got this round. Ma'am?

822
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,148
Oh, I got next.

823
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,108
Hi.

824
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,027
- What can I get for you?
- We'll take four shots...

825
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,821
We don't serve hard liquor, just beers.

826
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,949
Oh, where's your flask, bro? Right?

827
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,201
- We'll just take four IPAs.
- Great.

828
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,704
There's no handle of Hibiki back there?

829
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,416
- Are you okay?
- Huh? Absolutely.

830
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,959
- You're acting weird.
- Wha...?

831
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,419
- You sure?
- Here you go.

832
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,587
- Thank you.
- For you.

833
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,338
- Thank you.
- All right.

834
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,423
- There you go.
- A toast.

835
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:11,677
To higher education and to
my even higher pathetic golf scores.

836
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,304
- Such a dork.
- Cheers.

837
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,467
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

838
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,766
Oh, nice.

839
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,103
Come on.

840
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,689
Why?

841
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,443
<i>♪ Bull dogs, bull dogs ♪
Bow wow wow ♪</i>

842
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,360
Bow wow wow.

843
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,863
<i>♪ Eli Yale ♪</i>

844
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,782
- Hell yeah!
- Bow wow wow.

845
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,660
- Dennis, you wanna tee off first?
- Come on, show 'em how it's done.

846
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,789
I hurt my back on the drive up,
so I'm not sure I'm gonna swing today.

847
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,374
Now your back hurts?

848
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,336
What do you say we make it interesting?
Hundred bucks a hole.

849
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,795
Brett, that is so tacky.

850
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,548
- Please, I'm sure he can afford it.
- Definitely. How about 200?

851
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,841
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

852
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:54,720
But these clubs look like they were stolen
from a public driving range.

853
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,180
Oh, sick burn.

854
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,933
It's hot.
Someone hit the thing first. Whatever.

855
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,977
Just saying it might not be
anyone's best game. Just saying.

856
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,939
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

857
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,575
- He loves golf.
- Right. Heck yes.

858
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,659
Mm-hm.

859
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,540
What do we do?

860
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,671
Ah!

861
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,922
- Oh my God!
- Shit.

862
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,967
- Shit.
- Dennis!

863
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,635
God, he's so old.

864
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,679
- This is so embarrassing. Oh!
- What happened?

865
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,847
I wrenched something.
I told you I hurt my back.

866
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,641
- Let me take a look.
- She's a doctor.

867
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,226
- You're both doctors?
- Yes.

868
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,603
- No, I've done this before.
- You have?

869
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,729
My father has a bad back.

870
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,523
- I have a bad back.
- It isn't hereditary.

871
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,734
- We got in a car accident together.
- You never told me that.

872
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,070
You both hurt your backs
in the same exact place?

873
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,322
We both hurt our backs in the same place
before he died

874
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,491
of cancer.

875
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,955
- Okay, well, let's get you up.
- Ow!

876
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,456
You sure you're okay?

877
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,502
Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you.

878
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,670
Oh. Ah.

879
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,113
Last time this happened,
I was on the floor for three hours.

880
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,257
I can handle it.

881
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,384
- I'm just gonna go lay down.
- Okay.

882
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,386
Should I pay a loser's fee
for dropping out?

883
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,387
- Oh God.
- What?

884
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,014
All bets are off. It was just fun.

885
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,223
No, I insist.

886
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,142
- No, next time.
- All right.

887
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,745
Well, if it's not too unorthodox,
I'll hitch a ride back with...

888
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,604
Chanterelle.

889
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,980
Chanterelle.

890
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,442
- All right.
- No, I got it. Really. Thank you.

891
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,611
Yeah, I'm good.

892
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,386
They seem nice.

893
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,015
Perhaps we'll have more time
to chat with them at brunch tomorrow.

894
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,475
Mua!

895
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,652
What happened to my bracelet?

896
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,194
What bracelet?

897
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,239
A while back
you said you got me a bracelet.

898
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,493
Oh. Yes.

899
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,412
Well, let's say I will not be shopping
at Cartier anymore.

900
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,957
I went back and forth with them
more times than appropriate for a...

901
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,459
Okay, that's fine. No bracelet.

902
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,544
No. They screwed up three times.

903
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,796
- They got the...
- Enamel?

904
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,922
...enamel wrong.

905
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,800
- You said it was metal.
- Metal. I mean metal.

906
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,220
You interrupted me, Andrea, so...

907
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,347
I will buy you something
from another store.

908
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:48,102
No. I don't... I don't care about
an overpriced bracelet I never wanted.

909
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,185
Okay.

910
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,568
Can I see your diploma?

911
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,362
Uh...

912
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:02,491
Sure, maybe it's... It's in my car
with my <i>license and registration.</i>

913
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,574
Do you still have it?

914
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,744
What? Sure, somewhere. I don't know.

915
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,289
Because my Texas diploma is in a closet,

916
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,459
and I feel like a Yale diploma
is something you would hang on a wall.

917
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:20,676
Darling, hey, I'm not a dentist. Right?
I'm not an asshole either.

918
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:25,055
I would never have my degree on a wall,
especially an undergrad degree.

919
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,309
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

920
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,731
- Everything's weird and...
- This is still about the house?

921
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,774
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

922
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:41,029
I am so sorry, not only for how
I lied to you, but for how I acted.

923
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,700
It's clear that you're not trusting me,
and I can't say I blame you.

924
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,037
I'm so sorry,
and this will never ever happen again.

925
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,458
- Okay.
- Okay.

926
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,627
- How's your back?
- I took a hot shower for it.

927
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,922
It's much better.
Everything's better when you're around.

928
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,216
Mmm.

929
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,636
Why don't I take you by the house
this week? Huh?

930
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,805
- Yeah.
- We can dig up my diploma.

931
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,266
We can get my birth certificate,
my first report card maybe.

932
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,810
- Or we can bring your mom lunch.
- Absolutely.

933
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,605
- Put an end to all the mystery. Mm.
- Yeah.

934
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,688
- Mm.
- Mm.

935
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,651
I'm gonna put
the "do not disturb" sign on the door.

936
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,280
What?

937
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,490
Dennis?

938
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,285
Actually, Andrea,

939
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,038
there's something I want to say.

940
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,373
Okay, what is it?

941
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,462
It's hard for me to bring it up
because it's not what you think it is.

942
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,380
Okay, you're scaring me.

943
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,594
<i>For once, everything in my life
was on the upswing,</i>

944
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,263
<i>and I just wanted this
to work too, you know.</i>

945
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,432
<i>I loved what an odd couple we made.</i>

946
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,226
Come here.

947
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,241
<i>It was the ugliest ring
I'd ever seen.</i>

948
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,368
This is so sweet.

949
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,661
<i>It looked like a dick.</i>

950
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,037
It was a gift from my father.

951
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,748
Mother told me she wanted you to have it.

952
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,668
I can't.

953
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,504
I want you to be my wife one day.
This is just a placeholder.

954
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,966
It's a promise ring,
something from her to you

955
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,175
for you being you.

956
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,928
I love you.

957
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,011
I love you.

958
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,682
I do.
I just want you to know no matter what,

959
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,352
you are the realest thing in my life.

960
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,189
Now, put it on.

961
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,066
Here, now?

962
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,359
- Mm-hm.
- Oh.

963
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,778
- Maybe we should save it for...
- Come here.

964
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,658
- Wow.
- Wow.

965
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,201
Oh.

966
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:52,785
It's beautiful.

967
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,081
It is on my finger.

968
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,458
Mmm.

969
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,126
It sure is.

970
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,797
And we're obsessed with telling women
not to be picky. Right?

971
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,134
Like, "Don't be too picky."
"Take whatever falls into your lap

972
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,094
from the mouth of another woman."

973
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:13,181
"And be grateful when they give you
a ring shaped like a penis."

974
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,226
It's just society's way of making sure

975
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,355
you don't feel as special as they tell you
you should feel when you feel unspecial.

976
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,483
It's a tongue twister,
but I'm right about it.

977
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,032
Just be calm.

978
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,284
Be grateful.

979
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,705
Just try not to be a bitch
when the comedy is bad.

980
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,507
Are you dying?

981
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,468
Why haven't you been
answering your phone?

982
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:50,761
Because I'm at work.

983
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,262
<i>- Andrea.</i>
- Margot.

984
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,222
- Andrea, I have a friend.
<i>- </i>Cool brag.

985
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,476
I have a friend from the gym
who works at Tiny O'Tips.

986
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:01,021
She said there was a drunk guy in there.
His card got declined,

987
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:06,026
and he was ranting and raving about how
his fiancé is the star of<i> Space Cadets,</i>

988
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,986
<i>and she was gonna pay for it.</i>

989
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,446
Oh my God.

990
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,491
Because homeboy
is an assistant at a bank.

991
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,408
He's not a hedgehog,

992
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,787
and I guarantee he doesn't own
that house he's been talking about.

993
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,581
Stop. Stop. Stop. This is too insane.

994
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,959
Of course he owns a house.
I'm going to see it in an hour.

995
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,043
<i>Fine, your funeral.</i>

996
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,129
Margot!

997
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,853
Hey. Hey, how are you?

998
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,730
Hey.

999
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,408
Hey, guys. Sorry to keep you waiting.

1000
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,744
We just had to get
our last-minute guest a drive-on pass.

1001
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,956
Oh!
Today has been super cray! Hi!

1002
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,666
Hi! Hi! Hi!

1003
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,836
Oh, I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

1004
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,171
- Traffic was <i>insane</i> today.
- Oh, come here.

1005
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,965
- Oh, Jonathan.
- Look at you.

1006
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,092
What's happening?

1007
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,301
- Mmm!
- Ooh!

1008
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,513
The script. You, <i>amazing.</i>

1009
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,681
Amazing, sir.

1010
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:21,393
I basically begged Jonathan
for a role, right?

1011
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,895
I said,
"I'll be a waitress, a stump, anything."

1012
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,900
Well, hey, we are just so happy
to have you here, Serrena.

1013
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,111
- Awesome. I am just so...
- So excited!

1014
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,447
I'm so excited too, Jonathan.

1015
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,743
Well, great.

1016
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,786
Okay. Yeah, that's great.

1017
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,954
And grateful.

1018
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,874
So grateful to be here.

1019
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,584
Let's get started!

1020
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,667
Awesome!

1021
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,046
Take your seat, guys. Get ready.

1022
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,129
Hi.

1023
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,258
Hey, mama. Mm!

1024
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,802
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, guys.

1025
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,804
- Good to see you.
- Great, I'm so excited.

1026
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,223
- Ooh! Let's do this, huh?
- All right.

1027
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,561
Amazing! All right, you...

1028
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,938
- Thank you, Serrena, for the read.
- Thank you.

1029
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,148
- Lunch?
- Yes.

1030
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,816
- Let's do it.
- Jonathan.

1031
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,900
Hi.

1032
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,528
- Oh, hey.
- This is bullshit, Serrena.

1033
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,781
You're in a million movies
and you're on TV shows.

1034
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,617
Why did you have to pick
the only show that I'm on?

1035
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,120
Wow. Okay. Where is that coming from?

1036
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,915
Where it's coming from
is that you're a faker, Serrena.

1037
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,751
Who goes around long-hugging everyone?

1038
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:31,505
"Oh, gratitude."
"Oh, the writing." Oh...

1039
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,381
- Okay...
- I'm nauseous watching you.

1040
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,300
That's enough. What do you want me to do?

1041
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,718
What I want you to do

1042
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,846
is fucking stay out of my face
for five minutes!

1043
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,848
Pick any other show in the universe!

1044
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,141
You need help, babe.

1045
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,978
That is what people
who actually need help always say!

1046
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,275
"Hey, babe, had to rush Mom to UCLA."

1047
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,861
"She wasn't feeling well."
"Will call you in a bit."

1048
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,197
"We can see the house another time."

1049
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,244
Oh, we are seeing this house tonight.

1050
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,664
Shit!

1051
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,169
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1052
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,253
Ahh!

1053
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,797
Uh, hey.

1054
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,884
- Do you need help?
- No, you need help.

1055
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,221
No, wait. Yes.
No, I do need help. I need a ride.

1056
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,348
I meant like the security guard
or something.

1057
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,726
- I didn't mean me helping you...
- Give me a fucking ride, Serrena!

1058
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,980
Seat belt.

1059
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,817
Damn it!

1060
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,619
Okay. Well, good luck.

1061
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,371
This isn't my house.

1062
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,999
What?
Well, this is the address you gave me.

1063
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:49,916
Shh!

1064
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,061
- Okay, but I'm choosing not to talk.
<i>- Hello?</i>

1065
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,713
Margot, I'm in front of your bar.
Where are you?

1066
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,007
I'm telling you something is up here.

1067
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,426
I'm trying to protect you,
but I have my own shit to do.

1068
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,719
<i>Margot, I need you.</i>

1069
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,763
I'm going to see his house.
You were right.

1070
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,433
<i>Okay? You were right,
and I just need to see it for myself.</i>

1071
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,516
<i>Don't make me go alone.</i>

1072
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,771
- You won't believe who's driving me.
- Andrea, I'm sorry. I have to go.

1073
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,940
- Where do you have to go?
- To a meeting.

1074
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,704
Meeting? Where?
Quick, before you bullshit.

1075
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,277
- In Hollywood.
- Great.

1076
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,964
- That's where we have to go.
- Then I have to go to Beverly Hills...

1077
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:23,325
Awesome. Because somehow his house
is also in Beverly Hills,

1078
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,576
so this works out.

1079
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,286
This is fucking great.

1080
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,663
- Oh.
- Wow, Serrena Halstead.

1081
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,956
- Big fan.
- Oh!

1082
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,309
- Yeah, she's great.
- Let's ride.

1083
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,167
Let's ride.

1084
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:40,175
He said he went to Yale. He even said
he got me jewelry and I've never seen it.

1085
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,052
So you have no idea if he's lying?

1086
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,429
- Oh, I know.
- Or what he's lying about?

1087
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,223
- That's why we're doing this.
- Wow.

1088
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,850
Fucking well-equipped too. Mission ready.

1089
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,186
- Oh my God. Are you serious with this?
- Oh.

1090
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:55,273
You have a ready-to-eat meal
and binoculars.

1091
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,317
- Mini ones. Yeah.
- This is spy equipment.

1092
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,528
- Ooh! And snacks.
- I got survival guides for everything.

1093
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:04,741
Let's see here. "How to distill
one's urine into potable water."

1094
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:08,912
- How long do you think we're gonna be?
- I earmarked something for you. Read that.

1095
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,958
"The less attractive male cuttlefish
can fool rival alpha males

1096
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,461
into thinking they are females
by pretending to actually be females."

1097
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,297
"The dominant cuttlefish
don't notice their presence,

1098
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,383
allowing them in
and giving the lesser cuttlefish

1099
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:24,219
an opportunity to mate with the females
under false pretenses."

1100
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,346
Dennis is a fucking cuttlefish.

1101
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,807
He didn't act like a woman to attract me.

1102
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,642
He pretended to be something else.

1103
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,395
It's like catfishing, but worse
because you fucked a little bitch.

1104
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,440
Cuttlefishing. I love that.

1105
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,525
- Enough!
- Oh.

1106
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,403
We're looking for 1360...

1107
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,321
There it is.

1108
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,793
Wait, what if this actually
is his house and he's there?

1109
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,546
Or worse, his mom
is there and she sees us?

1110
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,755
Why am I scared?

1111
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:04,301
Because we're in uncharted territory.
We're under emotional fire.

1112
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,637
This is really
spiritually traumatic for me right now.

1113
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,431
Mind if I take notes?

1114
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,433
This could be really good for my role.

1115
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:15,228
It's just like so, like, raw
and like grounded, you know?

1116
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,689
It's like one of those dreams
that's really boring

1117
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:21,151
and it just keeps going,
and you just can't get to class.

1118
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,194
One of those dreams
that ends with us dying.

1119
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,321
Of what, the truth?

1120
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,323
Yes! With us dying of the truth!

1121
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,283
- You go first!
- Why do I have to go first?

1122
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:31,369
- Because I need my face for work.
- I need mine too, you selfish asshole.

1123
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,204
Margot, please. You're stronger.

1124
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,416
You're stronger. Look at my hands.
You said I was weak. You go.

1125
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,960
Maintain contact, baby arms.

1126
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,380
- Don't you have cell phones?
- They might be compromised.

1127
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,758
- Are you getting off on this?
- A little bit.

1128
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,806
Fuck. I'm just gonna go.
I'm just gonna go.

1129
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,059
- I'm just gonna do it. Just gonna go.
- Okay.

1130
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,279
Okay.

1131
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,995
Doesn't seem like a house
a young guy would own.

1132
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,577
Well, he acts old.

1133
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,828
That's fair.

1134
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,091
"Beware of Pomeranian?"

1135
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,425
This isn't the house.

1136
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,511
This can't be the house.

1137
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,848
Andrea, look! The door! The door!
The door!

1138
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,979
- Are you Dennis's mom?
- <i>Hola.</i>

1139
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,691
Okay...

1140
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,446
Oh! Maybe his mom speaks Spanish.
Don't assume race.

1141
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,031
Are you always this preachy?

1142
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,573
Uh...

1143
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,453
Does...? Does Dennis live here?

1144
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,538
Denise?

1145
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,248
Yes.<i> Sí, </i>Denise.

1146
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,582
- Denise?
- Yeah!

1147
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,667
Denise.

1148
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,710
Denise?

1149
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,176
I'm Denise.

1150
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,763
<i>Vive Dennis Kelly aqui?</i>
Fuck, "<i>Usted...</i>"

1151
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,516
No. You have the wrong house.

1152
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:27,402
Fuck. I don't know what that is.
It's not his house!

1153
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,863
Oh my God, go.

1154
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,781
- Okay, go, go, go!
<i>- </i>Fuck, Halstead!

1155
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,287
- So, what are we doing?
- I don't know.

1156
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,247
I mean, what is this even?

1157
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,832
Like, what is happening?

1158
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,334
No house, lied about a job,
lied about his school.

1159
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:47,297
How far back does this go?
Like, is his name even Dennis Kelly?

1160
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,633
He told me he went to Yale
the day I met him.

1161
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,553
- It's a long con.
- Goddamn right it's a fucking long con.

1162
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,971
Yeah. Oh.

1163
00:57:56,431 --> 00:58:00,477
"Hey, babe, assistant left early
so I'm stuck at work."

1164
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,022
"Also I lost my ATM card..." Poop emoji.

1165
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,775
"... and Maggie asked to borrow money
so I need to stop at the bank."

1166
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,861
"Text you later." "Love you, bye."

1167
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,739
Maggie. That's who we have to talk to.

1168
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,283
Maggie. She lives with the guy.
She'll know everything.

1169
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,785
We're gonna go to her house
and demand answers.

1170
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,246
- We'll kick down the door like, yah!
- Yah!

1171
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,957
And then say, "Hey Maggie. Wanna go out?"

1172
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,211
Why can't you just stalk her
on Instagram like a normal person?

1173
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,170
- Better idea.
- Yeah.

1174
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,671
- Less violent.
- Right.

1175
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,381
- Hey,<i> chicas?</i>
- What?

1176
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:35,011
So while I'm so grateful for the trauma
that really filled my inner well today,

1177
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,472
I also have a 5 a.m. call time.

1178
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,557
- Cool. We'll take an Uber.
- Yeah.

1179
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:43,228
Oh, okay. I just need ten hours
if I'm gonna look fresh-faced.

1180
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,521
We get it, you work.

1181
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,689
I'm the lead. I set the tone.

1182
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,609
One of the weirdest
conflicting feelings you can have

1183
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,819
is the feeling of wanting to be wrong.

1184
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,448
That goes against everything
that's in our nature as humans.

1185
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,200
You want to be right.
You want to prove

1186
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,826
your survival instincts are correct.

1187
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,163
Your whole life, you're taught,
"Stay away from certain kinds of guys."

1188
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,207
You're taught, "Trust your intuition."

1189
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,378
And then it gets you nowhere,
and you're single in your mid-30s,

1190
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,297
You're like, "Maybe everything I've been
doing is wrong."

1191
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,884
"Maybe I should give this
motorcycle gang member a chance."

1192
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,220
"Maybe I could be a stepmom
to his three kids."

1193
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:20,348
"Maybe I've been too short-sighted."

1194
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,892
"It's a homemade skateboard?" "Great."

1195
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,435
"We'll put on our Vans."

1196
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,813
"We'll get your mom
to drop us at the mall."

1197
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,357
"Maybe I was wrong."
The answer is you weren't.

1198
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,444
All of these things are instincts
that you've developed to keep you safe.

1199
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,239
So just hold out a little longer,
because you're not wrong.

1200
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,159
We met Dennis online.
Like what, two years ago?

1201
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:45,081
I found myself lacking in proper coinage
to procure a tenable lair,

1202
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,334
so my quest led me to a dark realm.

1203
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,671
She means Craigslist.
We met Dennis on Craigslist.

1204
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,672
Craigslist?

1205
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:57,677
- So, this is your dark arts art studio?
- I paint what I see in my dreams.

1206
00:59:58,803 --> 00:59:59,929
Your dreams are dark.

1207
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,266
All my dreams are nightmares,
and I sell my nightmares on Etsy.

1208
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,809
It's a passion project.

1209
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,605
Dennis isn't helping you out with rent
just because you need help with money?

1210
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:14,819
No, he's a liar.

1211
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,989
Like when we met, he said
he was starting his own hedge fund,

1212
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,574
but he never took the exam.

1213
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,327
And there are exams for that. Big ones.

1214
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,555
It's not like if you speak well
and go to a good school

1215
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,497
people will just give you their money.

1216
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,626
- I'm a corporate accountant.
- You are? Sorry.

1217
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:33,212
I don't even think he graduated college.
Where did he go? Was it Florida?

1218
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,089
That makes a lot of sense, actually.

1219
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,592
He's always late with his rent,
he's always asking for money

1220
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:41,721
because of his unquenchable thirst
to consume the elixir of capitalist greed.

1221
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:42,924
He wanted to look important.

1222
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,141
He was always bragging
about the girls he was dating,

1223
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,744
and I'm like, "How do you have money
to take out all these girls

1224
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,395
when you can't pay for your room?"

1225
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,564
He's like 200,000 dollars in debt.

1226
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,068
I didn't believe he was dating you
until you showed up at our door.

1227
01:00:55,902 --> 01:01:01,074
Invoking the image of him
engaging in lovemaking is horrifying.

1228
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,283
I must paint.

1229
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,664
He's been bragging about dating you
for at least a year.

1230
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,581
A year?

1231
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,001
He said you walked up to him on a plane
and asked for his number.

1232
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,254
Gross. Gross, gross, gross.

1233
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,340
I wasted so much good whiskey on him.

1234
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:20,760
Whiskey?
You're Margot of Margot's on Sunset.

1235
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,679
- I've always wanted to go there.
- Oh.

1236
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,056
You should come by. Anytime.

1237
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,974
Can you not hit on her in her own home?

1238
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,729
Can I see Dennis's room?
I was gonna do the thing

1239
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,606
where I ask to go to the bathroom
then snoop,

1240
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,984
but lying just feels
really hypocritical at this point.

1241
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,071
- Also, your house makes me uncomfortable.
- Resplendent, isn't it?

1242
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:42,699
Yeah. I'll show you.

1243
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,749
What adult volunteers
to sleep in a twin bed?

1244
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,627
I'm sure he'll tell us
he's got a bed coming from France.

1245
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,172
Who have I been sleeping with?

1246
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:08,975
Dude, fuck him.

1247
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,437
He is a piece of shit. Let's go.
Let's fuck up his bed and go.

1248
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,314
Oh no. We can't let you leave.

1249
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,398
What?

1250
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,651
She's kidding. We'll walk you out.

1251
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,654
I was just kidding.

1252
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:39,130
Is it possible that he lied
to protect his mom?

1253
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:42,425
At this point,
I don't even think his mom has cancer.

1254
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:47,138
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

1255
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:50,057
He lied about his mom having cancer

1256
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,268
just to get me to feel bad for him.

1257
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,270
- Holy shit.
- Hey. Hey, hey.

1258
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:57,774
Let's look at the bright side.
Maybe his mom does have cancer.

1259
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,485
- What?
- I guess that's being too optimistic.

1260
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,781
I knew it! I knew it! I didn't like him!

1261
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,904
I didn't like him from the fucking start!
There was something wrong with him!

1262
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,995
And you were up on me
about not being salty,

1263
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:14,540
and being fucking grateful
for everything that comes my way,

1264
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,376
to appreciate everything that I have,
and now look at me!

1265
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,921
This is so fucking embarrassing!

1266
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,298
I'm dating a serial fucking liar!

1267
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:25,593
I was just trying to help you
get out of your own way!

1268
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,513
I-I didn't mean
don't listen to your own instinct!

1269
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,932
It doesn't mean don't listen
to your friends warning you!

1270
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,518
You had your head so far up your own ass

1271
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,770
and his head so far up your ass!

1272
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,772
I'm the only one looking out for you!

1273
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,399
- That's bullshit!
- Fine. You're on your own.

1274
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,193
Please don't walk away from me.

1275
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,778
Margot, wait.

1276
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,031
Margot! Stop!

1277
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,450
The world is only the way
that you want to see it.

1278
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,411
You compete with Serrena Halstead.
She doesn't even sweat you.

1279
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,456
And you were so blinded by Dennis
because he fed your ego.

1280
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,167
And now you're turning on me,
your one ally.

1281
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,168
I'm sorry.

1282
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,796
I love that you're there for me
and I want to be there for you.

1283
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,339
You're my only best friend.

1284
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:04,882
You're my only best friend.

1285
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:09,053
- And fuck him.
- Yeah, and fuck Dennis.

1286
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,430
- He should pay.
- He should fucking pay.

1287
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,074
- He should fucking pay.
- That's right.

1288
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,267
How you gonna make him pay?

1289
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,750
You gonna complain to me about him
for the rest of your life?

1290
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:19,188
No. I'm gonna take control of my life.

1291
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,399
- What are you gonna do?
- Take control of my life!

1292
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,692
Eat a dick, lady.

1293
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,945
- I'm gonna do something.
- You gotta get in there...

1294
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:30,408
I'm thinking! I'm going to post about him
on Instagram and maybe Facebook.

1295
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,701
You gotta confront him.

1296
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,578
We need more. You gotta get in his face.

1297
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,496
You gotta ask him why. Why!

1298
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,249
We should... We should get him drunk.

1299
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:41,002
Yes! We should get him drunk
and make him confess.

1300
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,004
Then make him fuck a goat
and take pictures.

1301
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:44,088
What? What?

1302
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,090
You know,
take pictures of him fucking a goat.

1303
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:49,510
That's where you went? I said
get him drunk and you're like fuck a goat?

1304
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,554
- I don't know.
- That's so weird.

1305
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,390
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, mama.</i>

1306
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:59,562
<i>Your buddy, Margot, left her zombie
survival bag or whatever in my car.</i>

1307
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:00,771
<i>It smells like beef.</i>

1308
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:03,608
<i>- I'm vegan and my...</i>
- Don't open the front pouch!

1309
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,571
- Why?
- Just kidding. There's nothing in there.

1310
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,195
<i>- Cool. Can someone just come get it?</i>
- Yes.

1311
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,822
- Yes, I'll...
<i>- So you're coming?</i>

1312
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,532
- I will come get it.
<i>- Okay, coo...</i>

1313
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,994
Bring him to me. I got you, girl.

1314
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,871
- You got this.
- Oh my...

1315
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,377
"Hey, babe, I have some good news."

1316
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,297
"Let's celebrate
and get drunk at Margot's bar."

1317
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,299
"Love you."

1318
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,384
Wet emoji. Wet emoji.

1319
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,434
Motherfucker!

1320
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,604
I could have been rich.
Oh, this is personal now.

1321
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:42,855
What's personal?

1322
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,028
Nothing. Just celebrating.

1323
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,112
Oh.

1324
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,530
Wanna get drunk?

1325
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,824
I just came from an investors' meeting.
I had a steak,

1326
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,326
so it's gonna be hard to get drunk.

1327
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,577
I have Everclear.

1328
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:59,205
Everclear?
Are we at a tailgate party in Florida?

1329
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,289
I don't know. Are you?

1330
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,833
- What?
- Are you Florida?

1331
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,211
Am I Florida? I... I don't get it.

1332
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,712
Well, you're gonna.

1333
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,838
Okay.

1334
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,716
- Pour you a drink?
- Please. I'm having what you're having.

1335
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,221
Breug? Wow.

1336
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,063
- It's beautiful. All right. Heavy pour.
- Mm.

1337

<i>♪ If you listen close

1338

1339
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,029
- Top you off?
- Mm.

1340
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,742
Go for it. Built quite the iron stomach
during my Yale years.

1341
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,161
- Okay.
- A lot of drinking.

01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:57,470
Um...

1346
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,599
I am not nice to you.

1347
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,644
And I realize
it's because I'm mad at myself.

1348
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,717
You have everything that I want.

1349
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,251
Every time I look at your billboards,

1350
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:09,984
I'm reminded of the fact
that there's a girl out there

1351
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,153
who started just like me
and is the same age...

1352
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:13,320
We're not the same age.

1353
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,740
So I just wanted to say
thank you for driving me earlier,

1354
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,366
because you did not have to do that.

1355
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:21,579
You're welcome. But while you were out
becoming Andrea Singer,

1356
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:22,997
nationally renowned comedian...

1357
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,624
International.
I played Canada once last year, so...

1358
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,793
When I look at you, I get a bit jealous.

1359
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,172
You're a comic.
You can say whatever you want to say.

1360
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,131
I can't.

1361
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,801
I'm just famous enough that people
pay attention only when I fuck up.

1362
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,012
You get to make your own choices.

1363
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:41,515
I have a whole team weighing in
on what to audition for,

1364
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,142
what workouts to do. Like...

1365
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:47,188
No offense. I did <i>not</i>
want to do the<i> Space Cadet </i>show.

1366
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,106
- Really?
- At all.

1367
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:51,776
I promise I'm not out to get you.

1368
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:56,113
Sorry for how many times
I flipped off your billboard.

1369
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,615
- Wow.
- I do it a lot.

1370
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:59,992
You have a lot of billboards,
and I see them a lot.

1371
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,535
I'm so sorry.

1372
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,996
I'm flattered.

1373
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,623
You have a lot of wins ahead.

1374
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:09,043
Try not to lose yourself
and what truth means to you.

1375
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,045
I wish somebody had said that to me.

1376
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,506
I didn't just start, so...

1377
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,842
You know what? As I was saying it,
it felt bad, and I'm sorry.

1378
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:17,926
Um,

1379
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:21,055
I promise I won't be weird anymore.

1380
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:28,020
Mm. You're one of the good ones, Andrea.

1381
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:30,356
Thanks, mama.

1382
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:32,942
I gotta go.

1383
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,235
Nail his ass.

1384
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,486
Will do.

1385
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,114
You're really pretty. I have to go now.

1386
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,990
- It's hard to look at you.
- I know.

1387
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,371
Margot! Margot!

1388
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,164
Holy shit!

1389
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,209
I didn't mean get him this drunk.

1390
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,169
I made a pillow out of his jacket

1391
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,588
and covered him with cardboard
so no one would take him.

1392
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,633
Take him? Who's gonna take him?

1393
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,177
Well, I thought, now that he's here,
y'all could work it out.

1394
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,262
He's unconscious.

1395
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:03,597
Rule number one of war:
keep your enemies close.

1396
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,391
He's gonna wake up and run off.

1397
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,018
I wish we could get him
to sit still and tie him up

1398
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,854
and make him confess or something

1399
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,355
Oh, you mean kidnap him?

1400
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:14,650
- No, I don't mean kidnap.
- Because I heard kidnap.

1401
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:16,986
Nope, I'm sorry. Was that your plan?

1402
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,196
Less of a plan, more of a strategy.

1403
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,159
Hi! Have a good night!
We're closed!

1404
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,827
Help me get him up!

1405
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,248
Oh my God.

1406
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,625
Why does he weigh so much?

1407
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,335
Because lies are heavy.

1408
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,672
I am so rock hard for this mission.

1409
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,465
I've always wanted to kidnap someone.

1410
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:41,677
Not kidnap. We're not kidnapping.
Definitely not kidnapping.

1411
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,722
You know how some girls
dream of their wedding day?

1412
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:46,473
Shut up, Margot!

1413
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,144
I would've had the money to fix this door

1414
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:53,772
if Wall Street here hadn't given me
terrible financial advice.

1415
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,066
You know that stock he told me not to buy?

1416
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,903
It actually went up 40 percent
in the last two weeks.

1417
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,821
Oh, the door!

1418
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:04,033
Help me! He's stuck! Margot, he's stuck!

1419
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,619
- Oh, okay.
- What's happening?

1420
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,163
- The door. The... Oh God.
- What is that?

1421
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,375
- What is that?
- His body.

1422
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,960
Oh my God! What part?

1423
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,630
His body. I don't... I'll put it back.

1424
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:21,508
Oh. Okay. Ahh!

1425
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:23,010
- What?
- Putting it back.

1426
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:24,637
No, he'll get infected!

1427
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,680
- He's gonna get sick!
- Ah! Ahh!

1428
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,600
- Oh my God, help me. He's so heavy.
- Okay, okay.

1429
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,646
I once watched a buddy
pull a ballistic knife out of his butthole

1430
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,232
during a camping trip. This is worse.

1431
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:38,317
- All right, put him down.
- Okay.

1432
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,652
Good, good.

1433
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,279
Oh my God. We've gotta stop the bleeding.

1434
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,324
We've gotta cauterize the wound.

1435
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,661
Oh, fuck yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

1436
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:52,498
- Where did you learn how to do that?
<i>- </i>That<i> Special Med</i> pilot I did.

1437
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,124
I played a nurse. My line was,

1438
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,669
"We have to cauterize the wound
before he bleeds out."

1439
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,088
The director was like,
"Can you make it funny?"

1440
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,923
I'm like, "No, it's not a funny line."

1441
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,716
Hold up his arm. I'll show you.

1442
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,840
We have to cauterize the wound
before it bleeds out.

1443
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,053
See? Not funny at all.

1444
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,973
Ooh! Fire in the hole!

1445
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,646
- How is he not waking up?
- I don't know! Maybe he's in shock!

1446
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:18,691
Oh my God,
I learned so much by playing a TV nurse.

1447
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,485
Check his pulse.
Make sure he's breathing or something.

1448
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:25,281
JCPenney, I fucking knew it.

1449
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,592
That's the evidence needed
to prove he's a piece of shit?

1450
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,286
- Lord! No.
- We gotta keep him upright.

1451
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,455
We gotta tie him to the chair.
Use his jacket. Like that.

1452
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,416
- Keep his head elevated.
- Right.

1453
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:37,084
He should be disoriented.

1454
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,336
It's better
if he doesn't know where he is.

1455
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,630
I still think that we should film it.

1456
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,675
So that you have his confession
in case he tries to mess with you.

1457
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,969
If people watch it,
they'll see that he's tied up.

1458
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,596
So? We'll shoot him from the shoulders up.

1459
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,807
Come on, Hollywood.
Help me with this tarp.

1460
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,475
Fuck.

1461
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:58,939
Margot, you can't use a black tarp.
It'll look like an ISIS hostage video.

1462
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:00,607
He terrorized you, didn't he?

1463
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:01,900
Whoa, zinger.

1464
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:05,029
Okay, we put the camera over here.

1465
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:09,241
- No, Margot, you can't.
- I can't what?

1466
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:10,867
You can't...

1467
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,288
You can't put the camera
below his eye line.

1468
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,748
- He'll look hideous.
- So?

1469
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:19,752
I don't want people thinking
I dated some guy with a bullfrog chin.

1470
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,963
You gotta put the camera here
and come in over the eye line

1471
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:26,133
and use a key light. See?

1472
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:28,969
- That is so much better.
- It is, look at the thing.

1473
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,971
- He looks pretty good.
- Yeah, for a liar.

1474
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,557
- You should do more directing.
- I know, right? I think...

1475
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,850
What am I talking about?

1476
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:39,021
I don't want to do this. I don't want
to film him. I don't want this. I...

1477
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:46,195
- What do we do now?
- We wait.

1478
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,572
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go pee.
Are you okay down here alone?

1479
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:33,742
Down here with the body? Yeah.

1480
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:34,993
I'll be right back.

1481
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:53,846
That woke you up?

1482
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,224
What's happening? Where am I?

1483
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,600
What's...?

1484
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,893
What's going on?

1485
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,019
- Dennis...
- What?

1486
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,606
- I have to ask you some questions.
- Oh my God, did you steal my kidney?

1487
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,733
- Why did you...?
- Shut up.

1488
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,653
Nobody wants your gross, bloated kidney,
you fucking alcoholic.

1489
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,321
You fell.

1490
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:12,865
I did?

1491
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:17,077
No. Goddamn it, you are a liar,
and everybody knows it.

1492
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,721
- What?
- You got drunk, you passed out.

1493
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,248
Margot and I accidentally
smashed your flank in the door,

1494
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:22,541
then you somehow caught fire.

1495
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,418
- Am I gonna die?
- Probably.

1496
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:28,255
Yeah, you will probably lie
to the wrong person one day

1497
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:30,090
and they will actually kill you.

1498
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,302
But today is not that day.

1499
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:35,846
And fortunately for you,
I just want answers.

1500
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:37,973
Okay. Okay, okay.

1501
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,227
Why did you do this? Why did you lie?

1502
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,479
Lie about what?

1503
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:50,777
Why? What did I do to deserve this?

1504
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,529
What? I didn't do anything.

1505
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,240
- Fucking everything!
- My shin!

1506
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,325
Ow!

1507
01:14:56,408 --> 01:15:00,412
I cared about you so much,
and you talked about getting married.

1508
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,122
What... What was the end game?

1509
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:04,541
- What was that?
- Okay. Okay, stop. Stop!

1510
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,877
- What was that gonna be?
- Okay, stop. Please stop.

1511
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,047
I love you. That is not a lie.

1512
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,549
And I...

1513
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:14,843
Yes, I have lied to you.

1514
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,680
Basically since the day I met you.

1515
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,683
I am eating everything on this flight.

1516
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:25,687
I'm gonna chug a gallon of Cranapple
and chase it with a pound of cookies.

1517
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:30,067
Wanna know the worst part?
I was at TSA for 45 minutes

1518
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:33,403
because the woman in front of me
lost her boarding pass.

1519
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,748
Hey. You dropped this.

1520
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,460
Oh, that is humbling.

1521
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,173
Flight 1212 to Los Angeles now boarding.

1522
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:54,925
- Flight 1212 now boarding.
- Hi.

1523
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:57,970
- Yeah.
- My girlfriend Andrea Singer is in 2A.

1524
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:01,682
Um, I'd like to join her in first.
I'm on the upgrade list. Dennis Kelly.

1525
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:06,979
Mm. Unfortunately, you are 23rd
on the list, and it goes by status, so...

1526
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,858
- It costs 1360 to upgrade.
- Okay, absolutely.

1527
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:17,197
- You have to do that in the app.
- Okay. The app, jeez. Okay.

1528
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,992
- <i>And how did you know who I was?
- I didn't.</i>

1529
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,410
<i>I looked you up.</i>

1530
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:24,037
Wait, you're a comedian, right?
Andrea Singer.

1531
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,121
No autographs.

1532
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:29,334
That day, you took a call
from your girlfriend. Who was that?

1533
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:32,170
- Oh, excuse me.
<i>- </i>Yeah. Sure thing.

1534
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,923
- Hello?
<i>- It's Cassandra.</i>

1535
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,151
<i>Mr. Barnes wants to know
where the quarterly report is.</i>

1536
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:38,175
<i>Did you email it?</i>

1537
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,136
Uh-huh.

1538
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:41,513
<i>Can you re-send it? He's annoyed.</i>

1539
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,597
Absolutely.

1540
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,474
<i>I'll print it out, but...</i>

1541
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,892
That sounds fantastic.

1542
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,603
<i>I shouldn't be doing your job.</i>

1543
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,313
I hope to see you soon.

1544
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,523
<i>I won't be here.
I have plans with my boyfriend.</i>

1545
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,816
Talk to you later.

1546
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,276
Bye. Love you.

1547
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,239
She's just a girl from my office.

1548
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:00,865
I know.

1549
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,243
I just thought you were so beautiful,

1550
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,829
and in a million years,
I didn't think you'd talk to me.

1551
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:07,039
But then you did.

1552
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,999
You were so down to earth and so nice.

1553
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:12,002
I didn't think you'd like me,
so I started lying. You just...

1554
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:14,630
You seem like the type of girl
that wouldn't like a guy...

1555
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:18,467
That wouldn't like a guy...
what, who was nice to her?

1556
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,803
Who was kind? Who was smart? Why?

1557
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:27,225
Why, because I'm blond and not ugly,
so I deserve to be judged like this?

1558
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,646
Because I'm shallow, I'd go out with guys
who went to good schools, have money?

1559
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,273
Or someone bigger and better looking
with no substance.

1560
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:36,443
You have no substance.

1561
01:17:37,277 --> 01:17:38,654
What is wrong with you?

1562
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:41,572
Everything.

1563
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,869
But when I'm Dennis from Yale,
people respect me.

1564
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:50,457
When I'm a hedge fund manager with money,
people are nice to me.

1565
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,002
I don't care.

1566
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,504
You're nothing.

1567
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:59,800
You're just a guy from somewhere, and

1568
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:04,012
I'm embarrassed
how much time I spent on you.

1569
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,223
We got a live one!

1570
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,688
You could have untied yourself
whenever you wanted.

1571
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:15,107
You're just gonna
let him get away?

1572
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,317
I just want him out of our lives.

1573
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,277
I don't want revenge.
I don't want any of this.

1574
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,946
I just want it to be over.

1575
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:29,871
Goodbye, Andrea.

1576
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:31,998
And...

1577
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:37,462
...hopefully next time we see each other,

1578
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:40,507
it'll be under more favorable
circumstances.

1579
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:52,935
You okay?

1580
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,066
I feel unraveled.

1581
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,904
<i>I felt stupid.</i>

1582
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,532
<i>I ignored my instincts and my best friend</i>

1583
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:09,911
<i>for the chance at a life
with a guy I thought I should be with.</i>

1584
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,998
<i>I was willing
to ignore so much to be happy,</i>

1585
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:15,959
<i>and it all hinged on a man
who, deep down,</i>

1586
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:19,296
<i>was just proving to himself
that he could get me, or...</i>

1587
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:21,298
<i>...someone like me.</i>

1588
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,550
<i>It hurt like hell...</i>

1589
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:26,386
<i>...but I was gonna move forward
with my head held high.</i>

1590
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,514
- Are you Andrea Singer?
- Yes.

1591
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,351
You've been charged with assault
and kidnapping. You have to come with us.

1592
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,812
<i>And that's how
the motherfucker played it.</i>

1593
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,026
I ran for my life.

1594
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:44,696
This woman I loved,
I didn't think she was capable of this,

1595
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:46,990
let alone torturing me.

1596
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:49,075
The scars of being treated like this...

1597
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,496
...they're gonna last a lifetime.

1598
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:57,167
Mr. Kelly, how did you see
your relationship with Miss Singer?

1599
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:04,633
I was worried for Andrea.
She was desperate, you know.

1600
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,511
Her stand-up career was stagnant.

1601
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,430
Her acting career was tenuous at best.

1602
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,933
Her goal in life
was to have a billboard on Sunset.

1603
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:14,267
It wasn't the main goal.

1604
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:16,579
She was obsessed
with other people being better than her,

1605
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,648
and she saw me as a way out.
It's a lot of pressure on me.

1606
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:21,149
She's a failed actress,

1607
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,527
and when she got that TV show,

1608
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,321
I was so happy for her.

1609
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,865
It's like finally she could focus
on something else.

1610
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:32,160
You know? I just wanted to be supportive.

1611
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:37,290
Mr. Kelly,
is it true you lied to my client

1612
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:38,917
about having attended Yale?

1613
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:46,883
I am guilty of that.

1614
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,509
Yes.

1615
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:50,469
I'll admit it.

1616
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,472
I have self-esteem issues.

1617
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,894
I thought, you know, maybe she would
talk to me if I seemed worth it.

1618
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:02,357
There's no law against that, right?
Lying to a pretty girl over a drink?

1619
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,525
Objection, Your Honor.

1620
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,987
This is a trial about my client
being kidnapped and tortured.

1621
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,110
What does it matter
where he says he went to school?

1622
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:12,576
He could say he was the king of England
and no one would have the right to...

1623
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:13,952
Sustained.

1624
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:18,081
I have to say, counsel, you're gonna need
more than a few fibs to make this case.

1625
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,180
How did I get here?

1626
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,351
<i>♪ Bull dog, bull dog, bow wow wow ♪</i>

1627
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,812
<i>♪ Eli Yale ♪</i>

1628
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,366
I'm sorry.

1629
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,246
I'm sorry.

1630
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:00,999
I'm sorry.

1631
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,712
I'm sorry.

1632
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:09,506
I'm sorry.

1633
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,011
Dennis.

1634
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,349
Dennis, it's me.

1635
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:20,392
Andrea?

1636
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,403
You're so upset
that I was the guy you liked,

1637
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,405
but wasn't the guy you wanted.

1638
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:35,092
Then I was the guy you wanted
and I became the guy you didn't like.

1639
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:37,577
What are you, The Riddler? Who are you?

1640
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:39,913
Who is anyone anymore?

1641
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:43,375
Are they their Instagram page?
Who their parents want them to be?

1642
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,251
Are they a bunch of projections?

1643
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,095
Are they their dyed hair
and their fake tans?

1644
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,589
You are used to getting whatever you want.

1645
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:52,342
- What are you talking about?
- Shut up!

1646
01:22:52,425 --> 01:22:54,025
You're like
every other girl in this town

1647
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,429
who thinks she's owed something
because you showed up.

1648
01:22:57,263 --> 01:23:00,809
Women have it so easy.
Guys like me deserve better.

1649
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,687
That's a convenient way to think,
you fucking psycho.

1650
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,982
You have the audacity to judge me?

1651
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:08,565
We are the same.

1652
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,820
Well, not totally the same.

1653
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,196
I'm a better actor,

1654
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,783
which is why I'll be okay
and you'll be in jail.

1655
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:21,746
Dennis.

1656
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,383
I'm sorry.

1657
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:44,060
Ms. Singer, please take the stand.

1658
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:01,119
Torture, by legal definition,

1659
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:05,582
is the act of deliberately inflicting
physical or psychological pain

1660
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:07,792
in order to fulfill some desire.

1661
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,545
Admit it. You took him inside,

1662
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:14,591
drunk and unaware, with the intention
of deliberately inflicting pain.

1663
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:17,260
We saw the images of his body.
They were horrific.

1664
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:18,720
Well, try being under him.

1665
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,891
Your Honor,
please instruct the witness

1666
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:24,976
to confine her answers
to the questions asked?

1667
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,354
Ms. Singer, this is a courtroom,
not The Giggle Hut.

1668
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:30,815
- Answer the question.
- Apologies, Your Honor.

1669
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,318
Did I deliberately try to inflict pain?

1670
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:36,404
No, I did not deliberately
try to hurt him.

1671
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:37,697
What were you trying to do?

1672
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:40,658
I don't know,
but I didn't want to hurt him.

1673
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,285
None of this was intentional.

1674
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:44,746
If you want to talk about
intentionally hurting someone,

1675
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,669
maybe Dennis is the one
who should be on trial.

1676
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:48,750
And yet you are.

1677
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:52,045
Would you have dated my client
if your life was going better?

1678
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:53,254
Objection.

1679
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:59,260
This narrative that my life
was in shambles and that I'm insane

1680
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,471
is so Dennis won't look more pathetic.

1681
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:04,224
And isn't that what scorned men do

1682
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:06,893
when they don't get
what they want from a woman?

1683
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:08,228
They label her crazy.

1684
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,941
Would I have dated him?
I don't know. I don't know who he is.

1685
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:14,400
But you did date him.

1686
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,361
I did. I did.

1687
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:21,074
And what's crazy is that
all the things I liked about Dennis

1688
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:22,659
were the things he didn't lie about.

1689
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:25,245
I liked that he was smart,

1690
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:28,039
and I liked the way he was nice to me,

1691
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,251
and he was nice to my friends.
I think any human can identify with that.

1692
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:33,378
Ms. Singer, this isn't your stage.

1693
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,839
Please keep the monologues under an hour.

1694
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:37,549
Okay, I'm sorry.

1695
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:38,632
Um...

1696
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,444
- Just one more monologue?
- Your Honor?

1697
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,517
You may continue your answer, Ms. Singer.

1698
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,561
I'm so sorry, but it'll be good.

1699
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,482
Dennis and I are similar

1700
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:59,028
in that we were both really frustrated
with where we were in life,

1701
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:03,366
and we both felt that we should
have had more given where we were.

1702
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:07,162
But Dennis woke up every morning,

1703
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,998
and rather than work at anything

1704
01:26:10,081 --> 01:26:12,292
or try to be something or be better,

1705
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,085
he just lied.

1706
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:18,339
He's clearly capable of bad things,
of lying without remorse.

1707
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,466
Look at his arm. Why is it in a sling?

1708
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:22,635
Doesn't anybody check things like that?

1709
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,138
I may be a work in progress,

1710
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:28,516
and I get frustrated with my job,

1711
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,893
and I get angry at people,

1712
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:32,979
and I date the wrong kinds of guys,

1713
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:35,273
but at the end of the day, I own it.

1714
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:39,986
I'm honest about who I am,
and I'm not ashamed of who I am.

1715
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:42,155
And you can label me

1716
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,617
whatever makes vilifying me
more convenient for you.

1717
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:49,412
But let's not forget
to label Dennis exactly what he is:

1718
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:54,250
a lying, unqualified-for-life coward.

1719
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:03,444
- No further questions.
- We'll take a five-minute recess.

1720
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:08,723
- Andrea.
- Hey.

1721
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:10,308
Hi. How are you holding up?

1722
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,810
I just can't believe
it's dragged out this long.

1723
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:15,104
I know. Piece of shit.

1724
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:20,860
Oh, you were so good
on<i> Space Cadet, </i>by the way.

1725
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:24,072
- I'm so sorry it only went for one season.
- Thank you.

1726
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:26,783
And I'm so sorry
they killed you in that star fire

1727
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:29,577
and your whole face melted off
and you looked so scary.

1728
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,039
Uh-huh. Okay, well, thank you
for being here.

1729
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,749
Oh my God, of course.

1730
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,186
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.

1731
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:38,210
Go, Andrea.

1732
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:50,265
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1733
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:51,683
We have, Your Honor.

1734
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:59,899
Mr. Foreman, what say you
in the matter of<i> Kelly v. Singer?</i>

1735
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:10,368
Insecurities are a very personal thing.
This epidemic of a specific...

1736
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,328
Not all. Relax, sir.

1737
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:13,412
...kind of guy

1738
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:15,331
who's deeply insecure,

1739
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,750
and rather than go out and be better,

1740
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:20,878
you're just forever making
whatever woman you set your sights on

1741
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,714
pay for your insecurity.

1742
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:25,550
So it's not your problem,
but it soon will become your problem,

1743
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:28,052
the fact that he couldn't get any girl
to look at his penis

1744
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:31,889
until the age of like 36,
because his birthday was last week.

1745
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,725
And now it's on you.

1746
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:41,190
I think it's bullshit that we got
a restraining order.

1747
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:43,985
No way. Like I ever want to see him again.

1748
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:46,571
It's the easiest set of rules
I've ever had to follow.

1749
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:49,198
A thousand feet.
It's still shooting distance.

1750
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:50,282
Stop.

1751
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,703
Still pretty crazy
that the judge <i>actually</i> went to Yale.

1752
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:56,998
I felt like she was on our side,
like it was personal for her.

1753
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,958
Did you ever see him again?

1754
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,211
No. He moved out a few days after,
and even left all his stuff.

1755
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:03,338
Vanished.

1756
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,381
Still, it's a big day.

1757
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:08,009
I'm very proud of you.

1758
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:10,218
Thank you.

1759
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:14,557
I never asked you,
what'd you do with that hideous ring?

1760
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:19,103
I had it appraised, I sold it,
and I used the money to buy this.

1761
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,367
Fuck you.

1762
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:39,040
<i>And in the end,</i>

1763
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:42,168
I got my "fuck you" billboard
after all, so...

1764
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:45,630
Thank you so much for coming out.
That's my story. That's my time.
