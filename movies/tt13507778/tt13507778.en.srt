3
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:35,452
At that Florida Department
of Corrections facility

4
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:36,553
in Stark, Florida,

5
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:38,321
the signal has now come

6
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,724
shortly after 7:00 this morning,

7
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:42,059
Eastern Time.

8
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,327
The signal came
from the witness window

9
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,396
at the facility there
that Ted Bundy,

10
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,800
convicted killer
of a 12-year-old girl,

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,035
rape and murder of her in 1978,

12
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,004
had died in the electric chair.

13
00:00:53,037 --> 00:00:56,808
Many of those outside the prison
who had maintained a vigil

14
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,341
broke into cheers

15
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,677
following the signal
that Bundy was dead.

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,046
After exhausting

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,781
a series of appeals
that lasted 10 years,

18
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,582
Ted Bundy is dead.

19
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,838
<i>If it was...</i>

20
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:10,241
<i>something I could use,
I would use it.</i>

21
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,010
<i>I would learn their routine...</i>

22
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:14,912
<i>When they got home from work,</i>

23
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,814
<i>how often
they went out to dinner,</i>

24
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:20,084
<i>how often they ordered takeout.</i>

25
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,854
<i>If they had a boyfriend,
when would he stop by?</i>

26
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:27,624
<i>Did she have a dog?
Did it bark?</i>

27
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:30,593
<i>Those are the things
I would learn.</i>

28
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,830
<i>Then on the night
of the full moon,</i>

29
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:34,731
<i>I would make my approach.</i>

30
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,267
<i>The full moon is key.</i>

31
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,702
<i>You show a woman a badge
at night,</i>

32
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,271
<i>know some real details
about her,</i>

33
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,239
<i>she'll follow you right
to your car.</i>

34
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:44,607
<i>That's where I would hit her
over the head with a tire iron</i>

35
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,711
<i>hidden in the bumper
behind the wheel well.</i>

36
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,947
<i>Once she was out,
I would drive her out</i>

37
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,883
<i>to a spot I'd picked out
weeks before,</i>

38
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:56,053
<i>secluded, wooded, no traffic,</i>

39
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,655
<i>where no one would see my car.</i>

40
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,634
<i>That's what I would do,</i>
if <i>I did it.</i>

41
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,703
<i>But I didn't.</i>

42
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:49,106
<i>I'm innocent of the crimes
for which I've been convicted,</i>

43
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,209
<i>as well as those
I'm suspected of.</i>

44
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:55,146
<i>I'm an innocent man.</i>

45
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,731
I was at Roger's
right before Korea

46
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,100
with my first wife.

47
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,869
It wasn't my wife.
They buried the pig.

48
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:22,306
Glad to hear that.
We're all here.

49
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,375
And as you all know,

50
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,743
no good deed goes unpunished.

51
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:29,313
You guys did such a fine job

52
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:32,083
with the first
36 research interviews.

53
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:34,318
the Deputy Director
wants another 36.

54
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,153
- Oh, so generous.
- So...

55
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:37,888
we're gonna expand our list

56
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:41,859
to include serial rapists,
child molesters,

57
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:43,894
and any of the serial murders

58
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,763
we didn't get to
the first time around.

59
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:48,165
So, we put together
a tentative wish list.

60
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,869
You guys all know the drill.
You volunteer or be volunteered.

61
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:54,805
First up is Berkowitz.
Myers.

62
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,706
I got friends on the staff
up in Attica.

63
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,242
- I'll take a run at him.
- Take it.

64
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,977
Sounds good. Bittaker.

65
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,745
I'll take Bittaker.
Worked the guy before.

66
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,281
You got some family
in California,

67
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:05,883
- don't you?
- Yeah, Cali boy.

68
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,818
I saw your hand shoot up there
really quick.

69
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:11,422
You j... You just want to
go to California. Alright.

70
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,990
- Got your number, bud.
- Alright.

71
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:15,759
Hold on here. Bundy.

72
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:16,961
No one's taking that.

73
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,863
- No.
- Anyone.

74
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:21,165
No way.

75
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:24,435
Yeah, I'll take him.

76
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,238
Don't waste your time, bro.
He won't talk to you.

77
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:29,206
He hates feds.
He won't talk to any of us.

78
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,008
I can always give it a shot.

79
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,244
- Yeah, give it a shot.
- I've been fortunate in the past

80
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:36,113
with developing informants
that nobody thought would talk.

81
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,082
We're all familiar
with your record.

82
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:40,384
So why don't you meet with me
after the meeting,

83
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,986
and we'll discuss this, okay?

84
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,020
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:46,689
Look, Roger,
I don't want to buck.

86
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,092
I'm the new guy here.

87
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,827
I don't want to step
on anyone's toes.

88
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,362
He's not gonna confess
to anything,

89
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:53,430
but even the simplest thing,
it might slip through.

90
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,866
Look, there are families
out there looking for answers,

91
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,935
and if we can provide
closure for just one,

92
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:00,037
it'll be worthwhile.

93
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,372
Alright.

94
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:03,274
I'll have them
pull the files for you.

95
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:05,342
Oh, um...

96
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:07,244
just the biography,

97
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:09,380
not the crime scene photos.

98
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:24,395
Hagmaier.

99
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:25,496
<i>Hey, Bill. It's Will.</i>

100
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,131
<i>I reached out to the warden</i>

101
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:28,731
<i>about getting you
into that interview.</i>

102
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,134
- Did you talk to him?
- <i>Yeah, I did.</i>

103
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,036
<i>Bundy wants you
to write him a letter.</i>

104
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,404
Write him a what?!

105
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:36,006
<i>A letter.
Who knows with this guy.</i>

106
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,241
<i>Can you get it done
by tomorrow?</i>

107
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:38,976
Yeah, sure.

108
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:41,212
- I can do that.
- <i>Great.</i>

109
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:43,280
<i>You get it to me.
I'll get it to Bundy.</i>

110
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:44,481
Yeah. Alright.

111
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:46,984
- Thanks, Will.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

112
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:54,184
Agent Bill Hagmaier.

113
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:56,086
- Sign here.
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,288
You've got
to check your weapon.

115
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:59,356
Okay.

116
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,592
Agent,
he's not gonna talk to you.

117
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,594
He hates the feds.

118
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,496
We've exchanged letters.

119
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,532
He has expressed interest.

120
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,501
Oh.

121
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:20,144
Yeah.
I need you to talk to Bundy.

122
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:22,046
I have an Agent, uh...

123
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,114
- Hagmaier.
- Agent Hagmaier.

124
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,583
Says he wants to talk to him
or something.

125
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:30,154
Yeah.
No, that's what I said.

126
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:31,522
Okay. Call me back.

127
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,993
A while back,
a TV network offered him $50,000

128
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,528
to do a special.

129
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,630
He turned them down.

130
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,566
So, he's not going to do
something like this for free.

131
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:46,437
Yeah.

132
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,310
Well, put him on.

133
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,212
I don't give a good God damn
what he's doing.

134
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,847
Put him on the phone.

135
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,486
Yeah, Bundy.
Are you sure about this?

136
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,555
Because I don't want
any goddamn bullshit

137
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,890
splattering on my desk over it.

138
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:19,303
You'd think
you're smarter than him.

139
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:20,504
You think
you're gonna be the one

140
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,239
that's gonna get him to confess?

141
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:24,608
I don't think I'm smarter, sir.

142
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:26,677
I don't think you necessarily
<i>have</i> to be smarter.

143
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,980
This is what's going to happen,
Agent Hagmaier.

144
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,382
Ted Bundy will come down.

145
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,283
He'll toy with you
for a little while.

146
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,952
He will cat and mouse with you.

147
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:39,022
He will make you think
you are getting somewhere.

148
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,159
Then he's gonna leave you there,

149
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:43,694
go back to his cell,

150
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,630
and jerk off at the memory.

151
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:49,233
Well, at least that'll give me
something to write about.

152
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:26,703
You know the drill.

153
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:45,255
Well,
say something.

154
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,557
You came to talk to me,

155
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,992
Mr. Bundy,
I'm Special Agent Hagmaier.

156
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:51,094
I know who you are.

157
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,996
Well, I'm grateful

158
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,232
for you to take the time
to see me today.

159
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:57,100
We're compiling
a series of interviews

160
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,069
to try to find common threads

161
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,472
in the way that people think,

162
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:05,108
and we're finding it...
very helpful to get an idea

163
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,511
of what people in your...

164
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:09,746
situation...

165
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:12,316
well,
what their childhoods were like,

166
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,218
what brings out
their aggression,

167
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,353
what makes them angry?

168
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:23,527
My situation?

169
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,129
Your situation is quite unique

170
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,532
in that you also have,
from what I understand,

171
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:32,336
an interest in the psychology
of serial murderers.

172
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:34,104
I do.

173
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:36,173
You've been writing to
an investigator up in Seattle.

174
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,241
Uh, yes.

175
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:39,209
You mean the Green River thing?

176
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:43,180
Yeah, that's a really
interesting case.

177
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,516
I don't have, uh,
access to everything,

178
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,452
but I-I've started to piece
some things together.

179
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:51,555
And that thought process is why
I wanted to speak with you.

180
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,457
Not, it isn't.

181
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,359
Th-This is purely academic.

182
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:58,161
I know this is.

183
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,265
You FBI guys,
you're all the same.

184
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,835
You think you're better than me.

185
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,569
You're all just Hoover disciples

186
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:07,704
riding through
on your high horses,

187
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:11,843
thinking you've got
the biggest brains in the room.

188
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:13,744
If you're so smart,
why aren't you bagging

189
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:16,179
serial killers left and right?

190
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,649
Why doesn't witness protection
actually work?

191
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:20,852
If you testify,
we'll grant you immunity,

192
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,452
and you can go
into witness protection.

193
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:24,488
Live out your life
in a quaint small town.

194
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,657
But it never works.
They always get killed.

195
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,726
- You can't protect them.
- Well, witness protection is...

196
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:32,429
You are liars in cheap suits
on government salaries,

197
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:34,698
and everything is
an elaborate trap with you,

198
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,768
all so you can
retire on a pension

199
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:38,669
- and write your damn book.
- Look, I'm just...

200
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:42,472
No, no, no! You...
sell that to the tourists.

201
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:44,374
You can never trust an FBI man.

202
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,742
Not for a goddamn minute.

203
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:50,347
Mr. Bundy...
is this meeting over?

204
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,116
No, sir, we were
just getting started.

205
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,686
Mr. Hagmaier,
is this meeting over?

206
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:58,121
No, no, we're just having a...

207
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:00,758
friendly conversation
on the state of the Bureau.

208
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:04,728
If you get up and put
your fingers in his face again,

209
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,229
you won't be using them
for a year.

210
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,365
Yes, sir.

211
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,912
You could've buried me there.

212
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:22,446
Do you know what
they would have done to me?

213
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:25,649
Yeah, I have a pretty good idea.

214
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:29,419
Look, I don't want
to get you on anything.

215
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,823
I'm not even gonna ask
if you killed anybody.

216
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:33,891
It doesn't matter to me.

217
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:36,627
W-Why would you want
to talk to me specifically?

218
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,263
Look, we both have
psychology degrees.

219
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,834
You almost have a law degree.

220
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:45,937
You have more education
than I do.

221
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,473
I know the guys on the row
come to you looking for advice.

222
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,242
And you help them
with their appeals.

223
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:55,512
We trust you.
They tell you things.

224
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:57,481
I'm not gonna ask you
anyone's secrets.

225
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:58,816
I-I just...

226
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,618
I just want to recruit you
to help me see

227
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,387
if we're going down
the right road on this.

228
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,756
Are we asking
the right questions?

229
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:07,591
Are we looking
at the right people?

230
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:12,496
I'm not here
looking for evidence.

231
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,599
I'm looking for understanding.

232
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:17,668
I don't know what you know.

233
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:19,403
I don't see what you see.

234
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:21,873
I don't hear what you hear.

235
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:23,273
I don't think you'd tell me
the truth,

236
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:24,508
even if I did ask you.

237
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,811
I'm just...
I got to start somewhere.

238
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:33,583
Why do they send you down here?

239
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:35,318
Why didn't they bring
the prima donnas in?

240
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,688
Why didn't they send in
Montgomery or Douglas?

241
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,423
Well, they didn't even think
you'd talk to us.

242
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:41,491
- Why, because I had feds?
- Yeah.

243
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,727
I don't know where
they get that idea about me.

244
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,399
I'll tell you what.

245
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:51,301
I bet they think they would
do a better job than you.

246
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:53,403
I bet you're right about that.
I'm just the rookie.

247
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,572
So, this is what
I get from the FBI, huh?

248
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:57,474
A God damn rookie.

249
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:02,780
Let me ask you something.

250
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:04,314
Shoot.

251
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:06,017
What do you think
about this thing...

252
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,820
the pornography
and violent crime?

253
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:10,654
I read Dietz's article about it.

254
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:12,723
- Which one?
- The one from the BSU.

255
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:14,524
How do you know about that?

256
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:20,497
Where'd you get all this?

257
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,934
These are FBI bulletins.
Even I don't have some of this.

258
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,736
It's some
pretty heavy reading material.

259
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,471
I'm impressed.

260
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:28,638
Do you have <i>Playboys,</i> too.

261
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,540
That's what the scrum have.

262
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,642
I-I-I didn't mean to imply...

263
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:34,879
Do you really think <i>Playboy</i>
makes people do these things?

264
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,547
- No.
- Neither do I.

265
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:48,425
I'll tell you what
the real bad pornography is.

266
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:52,897
The marriage of pleasure
with the thrill of control.

267
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,799
The real danger isn't

268
00:16:54,832 --> 00:16:58,602
watching a woman get undressed
or reading a <i>Playboy.</i>

269
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:01,705
It's someone having the
euphoric feeling of having sex

270
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:04,809
and hurting someone
at the same time,

271
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:08,846
like in the detective magazines.

272
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:12,682
The ones with the girls
on the front covers

273
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:14,819
with their breasts
falling out of their dress

274
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:18,321
while someone garrots them
from behind.

275
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:21,424
"Read the true story
of one killer's obsession."

276
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,326
Exactly.

277
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,395
You know what those
are really good for, though?

278
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:27,799
- What?
- Learning how not to get caught.

279
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:29,599
I imagine they would be.

280
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,602
They are instruction manuals
on how to get away with it.

281
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,876
So, did you read a lot
of those growing up?

282
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,813
No, no, I never read them.

283
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,414
So how did you
end up in the FBI?

284
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,883
I think we should focus on...

285
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,785
- On me?
- Yeah.

286
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:50,054
You asked me to trust you, Bill.

287
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:52,389
But I don't know you from Adam.

288
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,494
I ended up in the FBI
by accident.

289
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:58,996
Oh, bullshit.

290
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,832
You've got to have a degree.
What's you get it for?

291
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:02,399
I wanted to be
a guidance counselor.

292
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:03,935
Oh, no. No way.

293
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:06,536
Seriously.
A guidance counselor.

294
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,607
How does a guidance counselor
end up in the FBI?

295
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,077
Two weeks after I graduated,
I was drafted.

296
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,146
- You want to 'Nam?
- No.

297
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,748
No, my brother was over there
and had just been shot.

298
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:20,650
That bullet spared me
from having to go over.

299
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,053
So, what did you do?

300
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:24,487
I ended up as a counselor
at a military prison.

301
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,424
And someone there
was a serial killer.

302
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:29,659
A few.

303
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,394
Did you counsel them?

304
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,463
Some.

305
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:35,699
I bet you never wanted
for a thing in your life.

306
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:37,068
What did your dad do?

307
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:39,669
Investment banking,
upper management.

308
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:40,938
Mailman.

309
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,642
Happy childhood?

310
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:47,178
No.

311
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,745
Were you close to him?

312
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,681
He was a drunk.

313
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,618
Okay.

314
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:57,554
Moving on.

315
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:58,923
Once you got in the FBI,

316
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:00,992
you chased a job in the BSU?

317
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:03,426
No, I was recommended.

318
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,863
Like I said,
I ended up here by accident.

319
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:08,099
You broke a big case.

320
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:09,834
I contributed.

321
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,202
Serial killer?

322
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,803
No.

323
00:19:12,837 --> 00:19:16,073
No, I-I developed a CI
on an armored car robbery

324
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:17,808
that no one thought would talk.

325
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:19,609
He gave us everything we needed.

326
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:21,511
- That New York thing.
- Yeah.

327
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:24,782
Oh!

328
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:27,717
That is the biggest
armored car heist in history.

329
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:30,487
I've read about you.
You're no rookie.

330
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,189
You're some hotshot
young upstart,

331
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,723
and I'm your next big case.

332
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:35,059
You're gonna be
the guy who broke me.

333
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,794
- No.
- Come on.

334
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,595
You can't bullshit
a bullshitter.

335
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:41,165
I'm not.
I'm a scientist.

336
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:43,667
I-I just want to understand.

337
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,635
Oh, you want to understand.

338
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,145
Well, I'll tell you...

339
00:19:54,178 --> 00:19:57,614
you and your colleagues
out there...

340
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,582
the investigators,
the detectives,

341
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:05,189
you're like fisherman
out on the water.

342
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,992
You throw your bait in.

343
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,961
You're trying
to catch your fish.

344
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,065
The smaller fish,

345
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:16,499
the inexperienced ones,

346
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,903
the ones who are still
driven by their ego,

347
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:22,006
well, they're gonna
fight for that.

348
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,707
They're gonna swim up,
and they're going to try

349
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,508
and get that hook.

350
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:29,612
They don't know it's a hook
because they're stupid.

351
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,849
They're arrogant.

352
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:36,153
And you'll... you'll catch
a lot of those fish,

353
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:37,620
but occasionally,

354
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,656
your bait will sink
a little lower,

355
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:41,624
to the middle level,

356
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,195
and that's where
the medium-sized fish are.

357
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:47,031
And they're hard to catch.

358
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:48,631
You only catch them
when they're lazy

359
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,201
or their egos get
the better of them.

360
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:53,603
You get them.
You pull them up.

361
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:55,139
You mount them on your wall.

362
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:59,243
You get you press conference.
You write your book.

363
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:02,013
But deep down...

364
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:04,081
in the deepest
depths of the sea,

365
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:06,217
is where the biggest fish are.

366
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,188
And you have no idea
how big they are.

367
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:14,992
You have no idea how long
they've been down there.

368
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:17,294
They see everything.

369
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:20,865
They watch everything.

370
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:24,201
Sometimes, they eat
the smaller fish.

371
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:26,170
But they don't take the bait.

372
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:31,008
The only way you can catch them

373
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,977
is to become one of them.

374
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,648
And you can't do that.

375
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:44,321
You <i>won't</i> do that.

376
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:50,194
Not yet.

377
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,263
Maybe someday...

378
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:54,597
if I can trust you...

379
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,670
I'll take you
under the water with me.

380
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:03,307
You can see how deep
all this goes.

381
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:15,252
Mr. Bundy, it's time.

382
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:17,288
- We're done anyway.
- Would you like me to come back

383
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:19,190
to continue this conversation?

384
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:22,293
Ah, we'll see.

385
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:25,129
Maybe I'll write you a letter
or something.

386
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:32,069
Oh, but if you do come back...

387
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:34,872
could you bring me some gum?

388
00:22:34,905 --> 00:22:37,108
- Well, that's contraband,
- Yeah, I know.

389
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:39,009
The wrappers.

390
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:42,645
Look, maybe you can
talk to the warden.

391
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:44,614
I'll see what I can do.

392
00:22:56,927 --> 00:23:00,865
So, did you get anything
we could use?

393
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:02,233
No.

394
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:04,135
But I got a pretty good
read on them.

395
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:05,769
Yeah.

396
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:07,670
You think he's capable
of all the other murders

397
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,373
he's suspected of?

398
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:11,108
Oh, he's...
he's guilty, alright.

399
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:14,378
- He all but admitted it to me.
- You're kidding me.

400
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:16,881
He wouldn't
say he did it.

401
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:19,083
He won't. Not yet.

402
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:21,318
But he wanted me
to know he did it.

403
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:23,387
He's proud...

404
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,855
proud of what he's done,

405
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:26,924
but even more so
that we can't prove it.

406
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:28,392
What do you think he wants?

407
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:30,461
Well, he says he wants me
to bring down case files

408
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,196
so he can help profile.

409
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:33,764
What do you say?

410
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:35,933
I say
it's more complicated than that.

411
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:37,868
I think you should
keep pulling at that thread

412
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:39,770
and see what's
at the other end of it.

413
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:42,173
Okay.

414
00:23:42,206 --> 00:23:44,408
<i>Man, how many times
do I have to tell you?</i>

415
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:47,378
I've got nothing else to say.

416
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:49,113
Here you go, Bill.

417
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:50,314
Thanks, Tom.

418
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,492
Hello.

419
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:10,928
Hello.

420
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,869
- You remembered?
- I did.

421
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:21,805
The warden was very particular
about the wrappers,

422
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,041
but since you played
nice last time,

423
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:25,242
he made an exception.

424
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:27,311
Spearmint.

425
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:29,046
How'd you know
it was my favorite?

426
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,481
I didn't.

427
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,026
Hmm.

428
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:52,803
That is very good.

429
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:58,275
So, tell me, what's the,
uh, tape recorder for?

430
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:00,344
I thought we'd talk
about some cases.

431
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:02,313
And you need a tape recorder
for that?

432
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:05,316
Well, you have a unique window
into this world,

433
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:07,318
and there's a good chance
you'll say a great many things

434
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:08,886
that I'd like a record of.

435
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:10,421
Okay.

436
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:13,590
- But if I say shut it off.
- It goes off.

437
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:15,859
Well, press record,

438
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:18,495
and let's get this
party started.

439
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,265
I'm gonna save this.

440
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:24,201
It is February 13, 1986.

441
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,936
This is Agent Bill Hagmaier.

442
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:27,071
I'm sitting with Theodore...

443
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:28,105
No, Ted.

444
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:31,375
I'm sitting with Ted Bundy.

445
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:33,110
Where do you wanna start?

446
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:35,012
Uh, I thought we'd
start with Green River.

447
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:36,413
I feel like
there's something

448
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:38,482
I could add
to the investigation.

449
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:41,418
I understand why they can't show
me pictures or tell me things,

450
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:44,621
but if I could just see some
of those crime scene photos,

451
00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:46,457
I think it would be something
of a revelation.

452
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,892
I could see some of the changes

453
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:50,094
that this guy was going through,

454
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:52,096
at least on a superficial level.

455
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:54,331
Superficial?

456
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:56,633
This is a person that
we're looking for here,

457
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,402
assuming that
it's just one person.

458
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:01,672
This is a living, breathing,
viable human being,

459
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,640
who's just going about his life

460
00:27:03,674 --> 00:27:05,609
in a way
that makes sense to him.

461
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:07,678
He isn't some kind of monster

462
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,580
because he wasn't
at the beginning.

463
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:12,349
He's sick, demented, sure.

464
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:16,653
But... when you start
using jargon like that,

465
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:18,922
those impassioned terms,

466
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:22,092
you forget that there's
a lot of him that in you.

467
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:24,261
I don't know about that.

468
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:26,563
There is nothing
that this guy has thought

469
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:30,033
that you haven't thought
at one time or another.

470
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,969
What, he's just...

471
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:34,571
taking it a step further
for one reason or another.

472
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:37,174
Well, sure.

473
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:40,544
They're crediting him
with 36 now.

474
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,679
And yet, he's still
avoided detection,

475
00:27:42,713 --> 00:27:45,416
even with a vulnerable
victim class like prostitutes.

476
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:48,018
Not a real high-risk crime
for the offender.

477
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:51,121
Still bold as hell.

478
00:27:51,155 --> 00:27:53,524
I'm amazed at some
of his crassness and luck,

479
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:55,392
going back to the same area,

480
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:58,328
even while all hell
was breaking loose.

481
00:27:58,362 --> 00:28:00,030
All of the girls being

482
00:28:00,063 --> 00:28:01,398
fully aware
of what was going on,

483
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:02,599
he still managed to get victims,

484
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:05,636
and then he just stops?

485
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:08,739
Now, do you think a person
like that <i>can</i> just stop?

486
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:12,209
It's unlikely,
though, if he did,

487
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:14,578
maybe he was exhausted.

488
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,313
Exhausted?

489
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:18,148
Do you have any idea

490
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:20,717
what a spree like this
would take out of you?

491
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:23,153
It's...

492
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:25,589
Too big a bite, man.
Too big a bite.

493
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,959
- I can't even begin to imagine.
- Yes, you can.

494
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:31,995
Do you think I don't know
why you're asking me

495
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:33,363
about this stuff?

496
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:35,566
What do you mean?

497
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,634
About the murders
in the Pacific Northwest,

498
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,303
Well, you said in your letters

499
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:41,038
that you wanted to discuss
the Green River case?

500
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:44,074
Do you want to ask me
about, um, Utah next,

501
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:46,443
or Florida or Idaho.

502
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:49,713
- What's in Idaho?
- I'm just naming states.

503
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:52,416
Look, I-I'm here to talk to you

504
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:54,718
about anything
you'd like to talk about.

505
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:07,164
Do you think there's a point
in a person's progression

506
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:11,468
where they... they say,
"This is my life's work.

507
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,036
This is what I need to do"?

508
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,640
Or do you think
it's a gradual escalation?

509
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:19,076
You know, it's gradual.

510
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,044
It's like a... a skier

511
00:29:21,078 --> 00:29:24,481
who has been dreaming about
skiing their whole life.

512
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:25,749
They read the magazines.

513
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:27,317
They watch the movies
about skiing.

514
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,052
They think about it
all the time.

515
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:32,689
And one day, they just say,
"I got to try that."

516
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:35,392
Right, and some people will
start on the very steep hill,

517
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:36,761
and some will start
on the bunny slope.

518
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:38,328
Some people take lessons.

519
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:45,502
What's your thumbnail sketch
of the guy?

520
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,810
Well, I wouldn't go so far
as to say how old he is

521
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:56,113
or anything like that, but...

522
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:59,550
he's either unemployed
or works part time.

523
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:02,486
Um...

524
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:05,222
Based on the frequency
of his killing,

525
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,190
the fact that his victims

526
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:11,395
were taken every single
night of the week...

527
00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:16,600
...indicates that
he doesn't really have

528
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:19,269
much of a schedule to adhere to.

529
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:20,737
Well, he's not married.

530
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:22,439
Probably doesn't have
a steady girlfriend

531
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:25,442
or anything that puts
regular demands on his time.

532
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,281
That's some solid profiling,

533
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:35,419
and you did that just with
some newspaper clippings.

534
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:37,387
Will you turn the tape off?

535
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:47,464
You know they think I'm crazy.

536
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,301
I'm tired of people
saying I'm crazy.

537
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:52,770
I'm tired of reading
psychiatrists

538
00:30:52,804 --> 00:30:55,205
and some of your
FBI prima donnas say

539
00:30:55,238 --> 00:30:57,574
that you have to have
some sort of complex

540
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:00,912
in order to kill people.

541
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:03,413
Normal people kill people.

542
00:31:11,856 --> 00:31:13,724
Say...

543
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:18,395
what's the worst thing that
you remember about your father?

544
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:19,596
What do you mean?

545
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,732
Well, you told me
you hated him.

546
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:23,700
What's the worst thing
you remember?

547
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:35,847
Our house had a basement.

548
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,316
It was the only place to play
when my dad got home from work.

549
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:42,787
He like quiet
while he watched the shows.

550
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,924
One summer,
a rat moved into the basement.

551
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:49,693
I could hear it constantly.

552
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,428
Always chewing.

553
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:54,731
Always scratching.

554
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:56,801
It attacked me once.

555
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,702
Darn thing bit me.

556
00:31:58,735 --> 00:32:00,938
I ran upstairs crying,

557
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:04,307
My dad, he didn't like me
interrupting his shows,

558
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:07,711
so he... he got up
and grabbed a baseball bat.

559
00:32:07,744 --> 00:32:08,913
He hit you?

560
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:10,882
No.

561
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:12,917
No, he went down the stairs.

562
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,686
I could hear him cursing
through the floor,

563
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:20,357
and he battered the basement.

564
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,760
A few minutes later,
he came upstairs,

565
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:24,996
bat covered in blood,
lean it against this chair,

566
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:26,998
went back to his beer.

567
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:29,700
Told me to go downstairs
to clean it.

568
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:33,236
I went down there and...

569
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,441
the worst thing wasn't
the blood or that smashed rat.

570
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:44,247
It was the silence.

571
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:46,450
I-I couldn't
hear the rat anymore.

572
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:50,253
I couldn't hear the scratching
or the chewing.

573
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:53,858
Any time I went down there
after that, it was quiet.

574
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:56,693
I-I stopped going down there
after that.

575
00:33:00,697 --> 00:33:02,632
You missed the rat.

576
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:06,737
Yeah, I guess.

577
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,509
Do you think
you could kill somebody?

578
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:18,348
I think you could.

579
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:20,751
Well, I'm an FBI agent.

580
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:22,854
I carry a gun, got a badge.

581
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,822
That's not what I'm saying.

582
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:34,364
Every morning, I say a prayer.

583
00:33:34,397 --> 00:33:36,868
I put on my gun and my badge,

584
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:39,469
and I ask God
for the strength and wisdom

585
00:33:39,503 --> 00:33:41,338
to know when to pull the trigger

586
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:43,808
and not one second sooner
and not one second later.

587
00:33:43,841 --> 00:33:45,943
That's not what I'm asking,
either.

588
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,649
Could you kill somebody?

589
00:34:00,825 --> 00:34:03,560
Yeah, I could.

590
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:07,531
And I could get away with it to.

591
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:09,934
I'm at least as strong as you.

592
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:13,037
Probably like sex
as much as you do.

593
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,672
I know how to dispose of a body,

594
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:17,574
how not to be noticed,

595
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:20,912
how to get in and out
and leave a scene looking

596
00:34:20,945 --> 00:34:24,081
like it belongs to a series
of other murderers.

597
00:34:28,786 --> 00:34:30,822
But that's not who I am.

598
00:34:30,855 --> 00:34:32,957
I wouldn't do that.

599
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:38,528
But you <i>could</i> do it.

600
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:40,932
Yeah. Yeah, I could.

601
00:34:40,965 --> 00:34:43,633
Are <i>you</i> crazy?

602
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,736
I don't think so.

603
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:49,506
Well, neither am I.

604
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:51,108
You understand that?

605
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:54,145
I understood that the first
moment I walked in here.

606
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:55,880
You're already better
at your job

607
00:34:55,913 --> 00:34:58,115
than most of the guys
you work with.

608
00:35:00,584 --> 00:35:02,787
They all think I'm Looney Tunes.

609
00:35:45,129 --> 00:35:46,998
I hear
he's sending you letters

610
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:48,732
Pretty regularly.

611
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:50,801
He likes to talk,
likes to be heard.

612
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:54,071
Just how close are
you two getting?

613
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:55,973
What is that
supposed to mean?

614
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:59,076
I mean, I hear rumors.

615
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,978
Watch yourself.

616
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:03,047
When you get too close
to a guy like this,

617
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,816
you can lose your way.

618
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,753
Okay. Okay.

619
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:11,756
So then the teacher says,
"It's imagination time.

620
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:14,691
Today, we're gonna pretend
to be like animals."

621
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:18,162
And so she goes, "Little Susie,
what is a lion like?"

622
00:36:18,195 --> 00:36:20,932
And little Susie rears up
and slashes a paw forward

623
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:22,499
and goes rawr!

624
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:24,035
She's like,
"That's great, little Susie."

625
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:26,804
So then she's like,
"Billy, what is a turkey like?"

626
00:36:26,837 --> 00:36:28,873
And he flaps his wings
all around the room.

627
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:30,775
Gobble! Gobble! Gobble!
Gobble! Gobble! Gobble!

628
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:34,211
And then she gets to Brian,
and she says, "Brian,

629
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:35,780
what is an elephant like?"

630
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:37,848
And Brian stops.

631
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:39,582
He thinks about it for a second,

632
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,919
and he stands up,

633
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:45,022
and he drops his britches
and drawers right then and there

634
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:47,624
and starts crab walking
around the room,

635
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:49,693
going, "Brr, I'm an elephant!

636
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:54,865
Brr!"

637
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:57,101
- Wait, how old was he?
- 4.

638
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,668
Did you get the call,
or did your wife?

639
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:00,737
It was her.
She was not happy.

640
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:02,639
Jesus, your son
sounds like a hoot.

641
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:04,541
Oh, he's a good kid.

642
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:05,810
He's got to be, what,

643
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:07,845
six months or so
older than Rosa.

644
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:11,115
- How old's your boy now?
- 5.

645
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:13,250
That sounds about right.

646
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:21,058
What do you imagine
they're doing right now?

647
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:24,527
You know,
while their daddies talk murder.

648
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:27,098
I haven't seen her.

649
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:28,899
I don't, uh...

650
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:34,839
I don't know what she does.

651
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:37,942
I like to imagine that
she's got a nice dollhouse,

652
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:41,212
but she goes out
riding her bike.

653
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:46,017
But then I also hope
that she's careful, you know?

654
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:50,620
A lot of dangerous men
in the world.

655
00:37:50,653 --> 00:37:53,190
Too many.

656
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:54,992
Do you have a picture?

657
00:38:04,268 --> 00:38:05,702
She's beautiful.

658
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:07,604
She takes after her mother,

659
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:09,306
Have you seen her mother
recently?

660
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,010
Not in a few months.

661
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:19,083
I miss the hell out of them.

662
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:22,186
- Rosa's getting to that age.
- That age?

663
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:26,857
When she understands
what people say about me.

664
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:29,093
Yeah, well, how do you even
explain that to a child?

665
00:38:29,126 --> 00:38:31,295
How do you explain that
to an adult?

666
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:33,663
Full grown adults walk around
that don't understand

667
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:35,032
that they shouldn't believe

668
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:37,634
everything that they hear
in the press.

669
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,937
How can you expect
a 4 year old to?

670
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,309
Does your son know what you do?

671
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:48,145
He knows his daddy
protects people.

672
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,850
Well...

673
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:54,819
Rose's daddy...

674
00:38:56,854 --> 00:38:58,621
well, he doesn't.

675
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:07,630
Did you get that letter I sent.

676
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:08,833
The latest one?

677
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:11,068
Is that the one about the girl

678
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:13,370
- who sends you the pictures?
- Yeah.

679
00:39:13,404 --> 00:39:15,973
I mean, a lot of women
send photographs.

680
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:17,208
Well, not like these.

681
00:39:17,241 --> 00:39:19,110
No.

682
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:20,743
I don't know where you would go

683
00:39:20,778 --> 00:39:22,980
to get something
like these developed.

684
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:25,748
The wall of your cell must
be quite a sight to see.

685
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:27,084
Oh, I don't keep them.

686
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:31,388
No, I trade them
to other inmates for favors,

687
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:33,991
- commissary and the like.
- You don't like them?

688
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:36,994
I always know there will be more
in the next day's mail.

689
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:49,340
Turn the tape off.

690
00:39:56,413 --> 00:39:58,282
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

691
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:01,385
Why not?

692
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:04,355
I...

693
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:06,790
You're getting inside my head,

694
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:08,459
I don't like people
being inside my head.

695
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,461
- I'm not inside your head.
- You're so full of it.

696
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:12,096
- No...
- I bet you think you know

697
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:14,365
what I would do
if I broke out of this place.

698
00:40:14,398 --> 00:40:15,933
- I don't.
- Yeah, but you do.

699
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:17,301
I bet you think you do.

700
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,103
Tell me.

701
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:20,304
Tell me what
you think I would do

702
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,273
if I broke out of this place.

703
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:33,317
Well, the first thing
you would do is steal a car.

704
00:40:35,753 --> 00:40:39,924
Then you'd probably head up
to the state of Washington.

705
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:42,860
You'd probably remove
a couple of people

706
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:46,130
- that are under your skin now.
- Yeah. Who?

707
00:40:46,163 --> 00:40:49,767
Maybe a... an investigator

708
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,302
that's pissing you off.

709
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:53,904
Not returning the letters.

710
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:55,806
Maybe a journalist

711
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,875
who's been...

712
00:40:57,908 --> 00:41:00,277
unkind.

713
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:03,280
Then there's somebody else.
I don't know.

714
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,053
A guy you think is
having sex with your wife.

715
00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:12,990
Then you'd steal another car,

716
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:14,358
slip over the border
into Canada,

717
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:16,327
and never, ever come out.

718
00:41:18,362 --> 00:41:20,064
We'd never hear from you
ever again.

719
00:41:20,097 --> 00:41:21,799
Fuck you!

720
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:49,827
You can turn the tape back on.

721
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,795
A-Are you sure?

722
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,431
I wouldn't know what else
to do with my time.

723
00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:59,103
You could write another book.

724
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:01,038
Oh, never again.

725
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:02,239
That didn't work out.

726
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:03,807
It was a bestseller

727
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:05,342
We did correctly anticipate

728
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:09,313
the baser desires
of the book-buying public.

729
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:12,283
They do want to be titillated.

730
00:42:12,316 --> 00:42:14,184
There were people who read that
for genuine reasons,

731
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:16,954
- but they were misled.
- How so?

732
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:19,857
Well, it's a funny thing
when money gets involved,

733
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,427
and people do things for money
that they ordinarily wouldn't.

734
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,829
And those guys, they wanted me
to talk about things

735
00:42:25,863 --> 00:42:27,131
that I was suspected of,

736
00:42:27,164 --> 00:42:28,565
and I was like,
"I can't do that.

737
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,502
All I can do is speculate."

738
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:33,304
Anybody who read those books

739
00:42:33,337 --> 00:42:35,572
knows nothing about me
or what actually happened.

740
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:37,875
Well, there are other people
who wrote books

741
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:40,377
who knew you before
any alleged criminal activity,

742
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:41,945
and they felt they knew you.

743
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,882
- You mean Ann Rule?
- Do you remember her?

744
00:42:44,915 --> 00:42:46,450
Vividly.

745
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:50,087
In her own way,
she's a very nice person.

746
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,023
All we did was share shifts
at call-in crisis center.

747
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:54,558
We never saw each other
socially.

748
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,093
My former fiancee,

749
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:58,062
girlfriend, friend,
what have you, Liz,

750
00:42:58,095 --> 00:42:59,430
she wrote a book about me.

751
00:42:59,463 --> 00:43:01,298
She had a far, far
better opportunity

752
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:02,499
to get to know me.

753
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:04,468
Better than Diane Edwards?

754
00:43:07,204 --> 00:43:10,274
Diane is a lovely person.

755
00:43:10,307 --> 00:43:12,876
But we were only just friends.

756
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,945
We never lived together.

757
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:18,916
Now, Liz, she saw me day in
and day out for years.

758
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:20,117
Well, Diane is referred to

759
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,652
as someone you cared
very deeply for.

760
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,520
There are a lot
of theories about me

761
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:27,591
that are just
a bunch of bull crap.

762
00:43:27,624 --> 00:43:29,426
Well, people think that
Diana and I broke up,

763
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,329
and somehow this was the...

764
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:36,467
traumatic episode in my life
that made me go over the edge.

765
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,902
But...

766
00:43:38,936 --> 00:43:40,604
It's simply not true.

767
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:43,107
It's completely untrue.

768
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:47,378
I know in my heart

769
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:50,214
that that episode
was not important.

770
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:55,652
Now you have Liz, friends,
family, relatives...

771
00:43:55,686 --> 00:43:58,021
they're all reexamining
our relationships.

772
00:43:58,055 --> 00:44:01,125
You know, they're...

773
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:02,659
"Did I see it coming?
Could I have stopped it?"

774
00:44:02,693 --> 00:44:04,128
You know how it is.

775
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:05,562
I saw it in him
when he was 5 years old.

776
00:44:05,596 --> 00:44:07,331
People, they don't
want to feel fooled.

777
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:10,033
You know, there's,
"Oh, I knew he had it in him

778
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,568
when he wouldn't open the door
for me one time,"

779
00:44:11,602 --> 00:44:14,004
- that sort of thing.
- Yeah, you kicked a cat.

780
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:16,073
Yeah, I kicked a cat,
and one time,

781
00:44:16,106 --> 00:44:18,475
I jumped up out from behind
the bushes to scare Ann.

782
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:19,676
Well, who hasn't done that?

783
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,112
And one time, it was that I...

784
00:44:22,146 --> 00:44:23,580
I-I walked along
the railroad tracks

785
00:44:23,614 --> 00:44:25,315
to see how long I could go
without falling off.

786
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:26,683
I mean, come on.

787
00:44:26,717 --> 00:44:28,619
It's ridiculous.
Give me a break.

788
00:44:28,652 --> 00:44:32,589
Jumping out from the bushes
was never my thing anyway.

789
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:36,560
There are a lot of myths
and misunderstandings about me.

790
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,996
Like you're a...
a master of disguise.

791
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:41,732
Oh, my God.
Yes, yes.

792
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:44,501
Just half a dozen photographs
of my many faces.

793
00:44:44,535 --> 00:44:46,670
But they were all taken
within a 10-year period.

794
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:49,206
They had
my graduation photo from '65

795
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:51,208
and my arrest photo from '75.

796
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:55,312
If you grow a beard, say,
just innocently grow a beard

797
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:58,282
or you come in...

798
00:44:58,315 --> 00:45:00,751
in a different mood,
wearing a different expression,

799
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:03,587
people are gonna think you look
like a different person.

800
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:08,225
But this is the myth
that they wanted to tell,

801
00:45:08,258 --> 00:45:10,294
the master of disguise.

802
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:11,628
But when you were caught,

803
00:45:11,662 --> 00:45:14,064
you had to tell the police
who you were,

804
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:16,133
even though you were
on the FBI's top-10 list.

805
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:18,969
I told them.
They didn't believe me.

806
00:45:21,405 --> 00:45:23,207
When you were a fugitive,
did that list have

807
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,541
any bearing
on the way he behaved,

808
00:45:24,575 --> 00:45:27,311
My manner of survival,
yeah, yeah.

809
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:29,746
But to be honest...
and I don't mean

810
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:31,615
to insult your intelligence
or anything...

811
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:34,218
but I don't think
you all catch anybody.

812
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:35,619
Not really.

813
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:39,690
I mean, there are exceptions,
certainly, but...

814
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:43,193
I think most guys get
themselves caught.

815
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:45,596
Well, do you think sometimes

816
00:45:45,629 --> 00:45:47,331
they want to get caught?

817
00:45:47,364 --> 00:45:49,233
<i>I</i> never wanted to be caught.

818
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:50,701
I know that's a top-tier theory,

819
00:45:50,734 --> 00:45:53,504
but it's more
pop psychology crap.

820
00:45:53,537 --> 00:45:56,406
No, the truth is, is that
nobody looks at those things.

821
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,810
Nobody keeps their eyes
peeled all day long,

822
00:45:58,843 --> 00:46:01,813
looking for somebody that they
saw on a "Most Wanted" picture.

823
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:04,181
Even cops,
they walk around.

824
00:46:04,214 --> 00:46:06,583
They don't believe that they're
ever gonna run into that person.

825
00:46:06,617 --> 00:46:08,485
So all you have to do is

826
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,121
go about your day,
don't act weird,

827
00:46:11,154 --> 00:46:14,759
And everyone thinks
you're just a regular guy.

828
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:16,426
I imagine that's
how serial killers

829
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,562
get their victims, as well.

830
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:23,166
I imagine it is, too.

831
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:28,672
You know,
we should write a book.

832
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,741
You just said...

833
00:46:30,775 --> 00:46:32,476
No, no, no, not about me.

834
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:35,245
About profiling.

835
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:37,514
We could call it
"The Bill and Ted Show,"

836
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:39,851
I'm not writing a book.
Not with you.

837
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:41,752
- Not with anybody.
- Why not?

838
00:46:41,786 --> 00:46:44,187
Well, then I'd just be like all
the other prima donnas, right?

839
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,089
Yeah, but think about what
it could do for your career.

840
00:46:46,123 --> 00:46:47,491
My career's fine.

841
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:55,499
You know,
if things were different,

842
00:46:55,532 --> 00:46:58,602
I could be sitting
in that chair.

843
00:46:58,635 --> 00:46:59,871
I could do what you do.

844
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,839
I have no doubt about that.

845
00:47:01,873 --> 00:47:04,274
And if things were different,

846
00:47:04,308 --> 00:47:06,109
you could be out there...

847
00:47:06,143 --> 00:47:08,846
trolling the streets,

848
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,815
looking for the right girl.

849
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:16,253
And getting to know her habits,

850
00:47:16,286 --> 00:47:19,857
how she does her hair.

851
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:23,828
which shoulder
she slings her purse over.

852
00:47:23,861 --> 00:47:27,799
Does she bite her nails?

853
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:29,867
You could be that guy.

854
00:47:33,203 --> 00:47:35,305
If things were different.

855
00:47:41,345 --> 00:47:43,547
If things were different.

856
00:48:40,737 --> 00:48:42,272
<i>The U.S. Supreme Court today</i>

857
00:48:42,305 --> 00:48:44,876
<i>said no to mass murder
Theodore Bundy.</i>

858
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:46,944
<i>The court refused to set aside
Bundy's conviction</i>

859
00:48:46,978 --> 00:48:48,780
<i>and his death sentence
for the murder</i>

860
00:48:48,813 --> 00:48:52,215
<i>of a 12-year-old Florida girl
more than a decade ago.</i>

861
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:57,554
Boss man wants to see you.

862
00:49:01,893 --> 00:49:04,194
Come on in.
Close the door.

863
00:49:07,832 --> 00:49:09,700
What is it?

864
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:11,869
Governor Martinez signed
a death warrant.

865
00:49:11,903 --> 00:49:13,537
How long does he have?

866
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,473
- 60 days?
- 7 days.

867
00:49:16,506 --> 00:49:19,576
Seven days.

868
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:21,278
Can he do that?

869
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:24,548
It's irregular as hell,
but yeah, it's legal.

870
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:27,484
He's ready to talk.

871
00:49:27,517 --> 00:49:29,720
- He wants the deal?
- Yes.

872
00:49:29,754 --> 00:49:31,288
Said he's ready
to confess to everything,

873
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:33,858
but he'll only talk
to one person.

874
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:37,327
Well, it's about time.

875
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,263
You hold his hand,
you tell him who to talk to,

876
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:41,732
go in the room, be in there,

877
00:49:41,766 --> 00:49:44,434
make sure he talks
instead of playing his games.

878
00:49:44,468 --> 00:49:48,039
We've got seven days to close
God knows how many cases

879
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:50,975
and put these girls
and their families to rest.

880
00:49:51,008 --> 00:49:52,709
Yeah, yeah.

881
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:55,645
That I can do.

882
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:59,984
<i>We meet
on democracy's front porch,</i>

883
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:03,620
<i>a good place to talk
as neighbors and as friends.</i>

884
00:50:03,653 --> 00:50:07,390
<i>For this is a day when
our nation is made whole,</i>

885
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:10,494
<i>when our differences,
for a moment, are suspended.</i>

886
00:50:10,527 --> 00:50:15,665
<i>And my first act as President
is a prayer.</i>

887
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:17,567
<i>I ask you to bow your heads:</i>

888
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:20,504
<i>Heavenly Father,
we bow our heads</i>

889
00:50:20,537 --> 00:50:22,907
<i>and thank You for Your love.</i>

890
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:26,710
<i>Accept our thanks for the peace
that yields this day</i>

891
00:50:26,743 --> 00:50:31,082
<i>and the shared faith that
makes its continuance likely.</i>

892
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:33,483
<i>Make us strong to do Your work,</i>

893
00:50:33,517 --> 00:50:36,087
<i>willing to heed
and hear Your will...</i>

894
00:50:45,797 --> 00:50:47,497
Thank you.

895
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:51,102
Well, look, we ran away
from the FBI to join the circus.

896
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:52,569
It's a madhouse here.

897
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:54,071
We got phones ringing
off the hook.

898
00:50:54,105 --> 00:50:56,040
I got inspectors coming
from all over the country,

899
00:50:56,073 --> 00:50:58,109
got media camping out
across the street.

900
00:50:58,142 --> 00:51:00,377
Now you're showing up
to join Team Bundy.

901
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,745
No, I'm just here
to coordinate.

902
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:03,647
Yeah, Carolyn's not
gonna see it that way.

903
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,017
- Who?
- Oh, she's the ringmaster

904
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,584
of Barnum, Bailey, and Bundy.

905
00:51:07,617 --> 00:51:09,653
His civil attorney.

906
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:11,055
What does a civil attorney
have to do

907
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:13,490
- with coordinating interviews?
- I don't know.

908
00:51:13,523 --> 00:51:15,392
You figure that out,
let me know.

909
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:18,361
Oh, and also find out why
a civil attorney has to visit

910
00:51:18,395 --> 00:51:20,832
their client 80 times
in three years.

911
00:51:29,774 --> 00:51:31,508
Okay.
We need all signed petitions.

912
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:32,877
All signed letters.
That Tanner letter.

913
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,112
- Let's find it.
- Hello.

914
00:51:35,146 --> 00:51:37,380
You be Special Agent Hagmaier.

915
00:51:37,414 --> 00:51:38,582
Mm-hmm. Bill.

916
00:51:38,615 --> 00:51:40,151
Mr. Bundy says good things.

917
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:42,153
Not exactly sure
how to take that.

918
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,922
- As a compliment.
- Excuse me.

919
00:51:44,956 --> 00:51:46,723
We're still putting together
the schedule.

920
00:51:46,757 --> 00:51:48,960
It was my understanding that
I was in charge of the schedule.

921
00:51:48,993 --> 00:51:50,694
Then you were misinformed.

922
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:52,864
The governor's not gonna stand
for any more games.

923
00:51:52,897 --> 00:51:54,698
The governor
is the one playing games.

924
00:51:54,731 --> 00:51:57,101
He could've signed the death
warrant for 60 days, hell, 30.

925
00:51:57,134 --> 00:51:58,635
He signed it for 7.

926
00:51:58,668 --> 00:52:00,704
He's thinking more
about his own reelection

927
00:52:00,737 --> 00:52:02,439
than he is about
doing what's right,

928
00:52:02,472 --> 00:52:04,141
and if he wants to play
politics, then so can we.

929
00:52:04,175 --> 00:52:05,575
This isn't the time to take

930
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:07,044
a stand
against the death penalty.

931
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:08,745
This is exactly the time
to take a stand against it.

932
00:52:08,779 --> 00:52:10,047
There are people desperate
to find out

933
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:11,615
what happened
to their daughters.

934
00:52:11,648 --> 00:52:14,551
- And we need to...
- Bill.

935
00:52:14,584 --> 00:52:16,954
It's good to see you again.

936
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:19,190
I wish it were under
different circumstances.

937
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:21,458
You and me both.

938
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:23,526
Mr. Bundy, I was just
telling Mr. Hagmaier that...

939
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,529
He will be in charge
of conducting interviews.

940
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:32,136
I don't think that's wise.

941
00:52:32,169 --> 00:52:34,205
Well, Bill knows most
of the guys here.

942
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:36,640
The ones he doesn't
know him by reputation.

943
00:52:36,673 --> 00:52:39,743
There's no one here
they'll trust more than him.

944
00:52:39,777 --> 00:52:40,945
Okay.
If that's what you want.

945
00:52:40,978 --> 00:52:43,180
- It is.
- Okay.

946
00:52:43,214 --> 00:52:44,916
Mr. Hagmaier, you can
be excused, and we'll...

947
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:47,852
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

948
00:52:47,885 --> 00:52:49,586
We still need to brief
the investigators.

949
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,554
Not without Bill here.

950
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:54,125
I would like to remind you
that he's law enforcement.

951
00:52:54,158 --> 00:52:55,860
Right.

952
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:58,095
- Right. Look.
- Yeah.

953
00:52:59,864 --> 00:53:02,133
I need a moment with Bill.

954
00:53:04,802 --> 00:53:06,137
I am not gonna leave you
alone with law enfor...

955
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,205
Carolyn.

956
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:10,808
- Mm-hmm.
- I told you.

957
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:13,911
This is different.

958
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:15,545
This is Bill.

959
00:53:17,214 --> 00:53:19,683
He's my best friend.

960
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,688
Okay.

961
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:30,828
You know, we're gonna clear out
the room and let them...

962
00:53:30,861 --> 00:53:32,797
let them have it.

963
00:53:44,909 --> 00:53:47,278
Bill, we both knew
this day would come.

964
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:51,115
I'm absolutely certain that you
knew more about my activities

965
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:53,884
and thought processes
than I was comfortable with,

966
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:56,087
more than you ever let on.

967
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,521
How long have you known?

968
00:53:58,555 --> 00:54:00,992
Since the moment
you walked in here.

969
00:54:01,025 --> 00:54:03,060
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

970
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:04,795
I didn't have to.

971
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:06,696
How long have you known
that I knew.

972
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:07,999
Since the first moment
you walked in here.

973
00:54:08,032 --> 00:54:09,566
Then why didn't you
say anything?

974
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,268
Same reason.

975
00:54:11,302 --> 00:54:14,571
All this...
is it just theater?

976
00:54:14,604 --> 00:54:16,107
Or are you really gonna
go through with it?

977
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,876
- Can't it be both?
- No, it can't.

978
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:21,611
The Florida Supreme Court came
back with their ruling tonight,

979
00:54:21,644 --> 00:54:23,247
7-2.

980
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,316
I mean, I have one more appeal
with the U.S. Supreme Court,

981
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:27,918
but they really mean to kill me.

982
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:29,987
They really want to kill me.

983
00:54:30,021 --> 00:54:31,889
You think this is funny?

984
00:54:31,922 --> 00:54:33,958
You've been sitting here
for eight years.

985
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:35,692
What do you think
they brought you here for?

986
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:37,594
It's just now starting
to sink in?

987
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:40,231
Y-Yeah.
I knew it.

988
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:43,700
I knew I knew it,
but I just now thought about it.

989
00:54:43,733 --> 00:54:45,269
They're going to kill me.

990
00:54:45,302 --> 00:54:46,837
They're going to kill
my mother's son.

991
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:49,306
Maybe they will.
Maybe they won't.

992
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,909
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

993
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:54,145
Let the bastards try, huh?

994
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,983
Look, you've got to do this.
You've got to come clean.

995
00:54:59,016 --> 00:55:01,085
I will. I'm gonna do what
I can in a major way.

996
00:55:01,118 --> 00:55:03,154
I'm gonna give them the truth,
but in a measured manner.

997
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:05,122
You can't hold
these girls hostage.

998
00:55:05,156 --> 00:55:07,124
Not anymore.
That tactic will backfire.

999
00:55:07,158 --> 00:55:10,161
If anyone senses that you're
stalling on this, you're cooked.

1000
00:55:10,194 --> 00:55:11,728
Oh, no, you're right.

1001
00:55:11,762 --> 00:55:13,798
It's time to come clean.

1002
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:15,866
But we still have a couple
of cards up our sleeve.

1003
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,634
- Like what?
- You'll see.

1004
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:19,270
You just focus on making sure
the investigators bring

1005
00:55:19,303 --> 00:55:22,373
the right material
and stay on track.

1006
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,975
What's the plan?

1007
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:27,211
There are investigators
coming in from Utah,

1008
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:29,280
Colorado, Florida, Idaho,

1009
00:55:29,313 --> 00:55:31,015
Idaho? Why Idaho?

1010
00:55:31,048 --> 00:55:32,883
I've got a couple surprises
for them.

1011
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:35,286
I told you, you can't play games
with the governor of Florida.

1012
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:37,388
You're not in any position
to extend your life

1013
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,656
by giving them some
Henry Lee Lucas kind of stuff.

1014
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:41,658
- What are you talking about?
- Why Idaho?

1015
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:43,726
Don't worry, Billy.
I got us covered.

1016
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:46,297
- I dropped two in Idaho.
- "Billy, I got us covered"?

1017
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,066
Why would I be happy that you
killed two girls in Idaho?

1018
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,135
No, you're right.
You're right.

1019
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:53,370
But Florida isn't gonna
do anything for me.

1020
00:55:53,404 --> 00:55:57,007
Colorado, Washington, Oregon,
Utah can't do anything for me.

1021
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:58,242
But Idaho...

1022
00:55:58,275 --> 00:55:59,810
They're gonna ask for more time.

1023
00:55:59,844 --> 00:56:01,345
And they can
petition the governor.

1024
00:56:01,378 --> 00:56:03,247
- Ted, you cannot...
- I'm not stalling.

1025
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,782
I'm not playing games.

1026
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:06,317
I'm coming clean.
And if that means bringing

1027
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,985
other states into the mix,
then so be it.

1028
00:56:08,018 --> 00:56:09,386
- How many?
- Five.

1029
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,122
Not how many states.
How many girls?

1030
00:56:11,155 --> 00:56:13,723
- Am I talking about?
- How many did you kill?

1031
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:14,691
That.

1032
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:17,094
Yes, that.

1033
00:56:17,128 --> 00:56:18,695
Let's say 30.

1034
00:56:18,728 --> 00:56:20,231
Let's say we talk
about the real number.

1035
00:56:20,264 --> 00:56:21,966
30 is a nice round number.

1036
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:23,700
How many?

1037
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:25,236
I don't know.

1038
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:27,004
What do you mean you don't know?

1039
00:56:27,037 --> 00:56:30,307
I didn't keep score,
and it gets confusing.

1040
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:32,443
I don't understand
what gets so confusing.

1041
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:35,012
I'm not even sure
all of them are dead.

1042
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:36,746
There are several girls,

1043
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,884
girls that I hit over the head
and put in my car.

1044
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:41,285
When I would drag them
out to the woods.

1045
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:44,155
they would wake up,
sometimes in my arms.

1046
00:56:44,188 --> 00:56:46,824
Sometimes when I went back
to my car to get my tools.

1047
00:56:46,857 --> 00:56:48,292
They all took off
into the woods,

1048
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:50,727
and I couldn't find them.

1049
00:56:50,761 --> 00:56:51,996
I'd go home.

1050
00:56:52,029 --> 00:56:54,932
I'd watch the news,
but not a peep.

1051
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:56,767
No news.

1052
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,903
So did they run home
and change their name,

1053
00:56:58,936 --> 00:57:00,371
never to tell anyone
what happened,

1054
00:57:00,404 --> 00:57:02,806
afraid that I would
come back and try again?

1055
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,875
Or did they die in those woods?
I don't know.

1056
00:57:04,909 --> 00:57:08,479
So, it could be more than 30?

1057
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,381
Then there are the dry runs.

1058
00:57:10,414 --> 00:57:11,949
Dry runs.

1059
00:57:11,982 --> 00:57:13,484
There are a lot
of girls I stalked,

1060
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:16,420
learned everything about,
staked out my spot,

1061
00:57:16,453 --> 00:57:19,190
walked up to their door,
passed them on the street,

1062
00:57:19,223 --> 00:57:20,758
and just walked away.

1063
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:22,259
Why?

1064
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:24,795
Because every time
I did this, I asked myself,

1065
00:57:24,828 --> 00:57:26,330
am I going to kill this girl?

1066
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,999
Sometimes I said no,
and I never went back for her.

1067
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:30,733
I didn't understand.

1068
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:32,436
Because the minute I say no
and couldn't walk away,

1069
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:35,372
it was the minute I was
on the road to being caught.

1070
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:38,842
Diane Leach.

1071
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:42,279
I couldn't say no.

1072
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:44,348
She was a mistake.

1073
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:46,250
I should never have killed
a 12-year-old girl.

1074
00:57:46,283 --> 00:57:47,818
- <i>She</i> was a mistake?
- Yes.

1075
00:57:47,851 --> 00:57:50,754
- And the others?
- Choices.

1076
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:53,157
Can't really call those
mistakes, can I?

1077
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,959
So 30.

1078
00:57:57,228 --> 00:57:59,430
I can for sure admit to 30.

1079
00:58:01,532 --> 00:58:04,802
Why am I here, really?

1080
00:58:04,835 --> 00:58:08,772
Bill, we've spent a good deal
of time together.

1081
00:58:08,806 --> 00:58:11,075
Not as much as some
of the others.

1082
00:58:12,876 --> 00:58:14,511
Yes, but you knew all along,

1083
00:58:14,545 --> 00:58:16,513
and you treated me
like a human being.

1084
00:58:16,547 --> 00:58:18,782
You just wanted to understand.

1085
00:58:18,816 --> 00:58:20,851
I still do.

1086
00:58:20,884 --> 00:58:24,121
That's why you're here.

1087
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:26,056
Each of the investigators
get two hours.

1088
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:28,459
I have a handful
of other interviews.

1089
00:58:28,492 --> 00:58:30,527
And then
when everything is clear,

1090
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:32,997
you and I will sit down
and have the conversation

1091
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,399
you've wanted this whole time.

1092
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:38,002
What are you going to tell me?

1093
00:58:38,035 --> 00:58:40,137
Everything.

1094
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:52,249
What's this... gizmo?

1095
00:58:52,283 --> 00:58:54,585
This will pick up everything
you're saying

1096
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:57,955
and everything that we're saying
over here on the other side.

1097
00:58:57,988 --> 00:59:00,224
Well, let's just
get it out in the open now.

1098
00:59:00,257 --> 00:59:03,193
Mike, I know you have
some intense feelings about me.

1099
00:59:03,227 --> 00:59:05,262
- No.
- Well, you may or you may not,

1100
00:59:05,296 --> 00:59:06,830
but if you think
I'm bullshitting you,

1101
00:59:06,864 --> 00:59:08,032
you tell me.

1102
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:09,833
If I thought you
were just gonna...

1103
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:12,136
jack it around all day,
I wouldn't be here.

1104
00:59:12,169 --> 00:59:14,204
All right.

1105
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:15,839
I've been sent here
to talk to you

1106
00:59:15,873 --> 00:59:17,141
about Grand Junction.

1107
00:59:17,174 --> 00:59:19,009
Where?

1108
00:59:19,043 --> 00:59:21,245
And Vale.

1109
00:59:21,278 --> 00:59:25,049
Let's start with
Bountiful, Utah.

1110
00:59:25,082 --> 00:59:26,583
I really need a map for that.

1111
00:59:26,617 --> 00:59:28,452
Eugene, Oregon.

1112
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:32,956
And then we'll move on
to West Linn and in Corvallis.

1113
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:37,961
So, where exactly, Mr. Bundy,
did you take these girls from?

1114
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:39,430
- Excuse me?
- Well, there are a number

1115
00:59:39,463 --> 00:59:42,232
of unsolved disappearances
in the state of Idaho.

1116
00:59:42,266 --> 00:59:44,168
Frankly, sir,
we have no idea

1117
00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:45,536
which victims are yours.

1118
00:59:45,569 --> 00:59:47,538
Is there any need
as far as the Western slope

1119
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:49,039
of Colorado is concerned,

1120
00:59:49,073 --> 00:59:52,309
for us to go back
before 1975,

1121
00:59:52,343 --> 00:59:55,145
maybe even as far back as '68?

1122
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:57,614
No.

1123
00:59:57,648 --> 01:00:00,184
I didn't get to Colorado
until '75.

1124
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:01,919
I really need a map for that.

1125
01:00:01,952 --> 01:00:03,987
I mean, didn't your
office tell you.

1126
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,357
Yes, we're trying to get maps
down here as soon as possible.

1127
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:07,591
The clock is ticking here,
so...

1128
01:00:07,624 --> 01:00:08,926
If you want
to describe the area,

1129
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:10,194
I know it pretty well.

1130
01:00:10,227 --> 01:00:11,562
I could try.

1131
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:13,997
Well, that was a long time ago.

1132
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:15,199
I mean, that was...

1133
01:00:15,232 --> 01:00:20,371
There were... a lot...

1134
01:00:20,404 --> 01:00:22,506
There were a lot of girls
since then.

1135
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:25,008
Did you clean the car
afterwards.

1136
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,210
I don't remember.

1137
01:00:26,243 --> 01:00:28,178
if you were driving
60 miles an hour

1138
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:30,147
traveling south for...

1139
01:00:33,016 --> 01:00:34,685
Didn't think there'd be math
on this test, did you?

1140
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:37,454
- No, I did not.
- No, no, me neither.

1141
01:00:37,488 --> 01:00:40,557
You said that was north
of Pocatello, yeah?

1142
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:42,126
- I don't know its name.
- Okay.

1143
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:43,627
But you drowned her there.

1144
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,696
No, I drowned her
in my hotel room.

1145
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:47,698
I only dumped her body
in the river.

1146
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:50,300
And then what did you do...

1147
01:00:50,334 --> 01:00:53,070
after you killed her?

1148
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:55,172
I'm trying to work
with you here.

1149
01:00:55,205 --> 01:00:56,240
I know.

1150
01:00:56,273 --> 01:00:57,608
Look...

1151
01:00:57,641 --> 01:01:00,444
I think we're getting
close to lunch.

1152
01:01:02,279 --> 01:01:04,148
Alright.
Let's break for lunch.

1153
01:01:04,181 --> 01:01:05,949
We'll resume this after.

1154
01:01:05,983 --> 01:01:07,384
Y...

1155
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,455
You're stalling.

1156
01:01:11,488 --> 01:01:14,124
No, I'm lying.
There's a difference.

1157
01:01:14,158 --> 01:01:16,393
What happened to giving up
everything in a major way?

1158
01:01:16,427 --> 01:01:18,128
- You didn't see it.
- See what?

1159
01:01:18,162 --> 01:01:22,099
- He knew her.
- What? Bull.

1160
01:01:22,132 --> 01:01:23,667
- How could you tell?
- I don't know.

1161
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,270
I don't know. Something
in the way he talked about it.

1162
01:01:26,303 --> 01:01:28,038
I don't know.
It was in his eyes.

1163
01:01:28,071 --> 01:01:29,740
I don't know if they were dating
or romantic or whatever,

1164
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:31,642
but he had a relationship
with that girl.

1165
01:01:31,675 --> 01:01:33,343
Well, I didn't see it.

1166
01:01:33,377 --> 01:01:35,112
That's because you
weren't sitting across from him.

1167
01:01:35,145 --> 01:01:36,447
- You would've if you were.
- So, you didn't tell him...

1168
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,081
Because I didn't want
to tell that guy

1169
01:01:38,115 --> 01:01:39,383
that I made love
to his dead girlfriend

1170
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:42,619
right before I cut her head
clean off.

1171
01:01:42,653 --> 01:01:45,556
Jesus.

1172
01:01:47,491 --> 01:01:51,261
I'm going to lunch.

1173
01:02:07,744 --> 01:02:10,314
Okay. Let's go back
to Grand Junction.

1174
01:02:10,347 --> 01:02:12,149
May I ask you something,
just briefly.

1175
01:02:12,182 --> 01:02:15,152
- Certainly.
- Did you know her?

1176
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:21,058
Yes, I did.

1177
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:24,161
I had a feeling.
I could just, uh...

1178
01:02:24,194 --> 01:02:25,797
sense the emotion.

1179
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,264
Yeah. Well...

1180
01:02:29,767 --> 01:02:31,101
It's an emotional thing.

1181
01:02:31,134 --> 01:02:32,569
Sure, I know that.

1182
01:02:32,603 --> 01:02:34,371
I would appreciate it
if you didn't let that

1183
01:02:34,404 --> 01:02:36,240
color our conversation here.

1184
01:02:36,273 --> 01:02:37,608
I think we should
move on to Vale.

1185
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:39,510
I still have a few more
questions about...

1186
01:02:39,543 --> 01:02:40,744
Vale.

1187
01:02:40,778 --> 01:02:41,745
You drive back safe.

1188
01:02:41,779 --> 01:02:43,380
Yeah.

1189
01:03:01,398 --> 01:03:04,067
So, about tomorrow.

1190
01:03:04,101 --> 01:03:06,570
- You mean the Dobson thing.
- What Dobson thing?

1191
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:11,241
Some radio preacher,
televangelist.

1192
01:03:11,275 --> 01:03:12,509
Carolyn set it up.

1193
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:13,778
We said no media

1194
01:03:13,811 --> 01:03:17,247
We'll you'll have
to talk to Carolyn.

1195
01:03:18,816 --> 01:03:22,419
Okay. Can you do me a favor?
Put your father on.

1196
01:03:22,452 --> 01:03:24,688
Hi.

1197
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:26,423
Yeah, no, it's...

1198
01:03:26,456 --> 01:03:29,526
no easier today, no.

1199
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,330
Oh, yeah. Comes with
the territory, right?

1200
01:03:33,363 --> 01:03:35,732
Uh-huh.

1201
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:38,168
Yeah, no, I'm leaving now.

1202
01:03:38,201 --> 01:03:41,271
Mm-hmm.
I should, uh...

1203
01:03:41,305 --> 01:03:43,440
I should go.

1204
01:03:43,473 --> 01:03:46,677
Okay. Yes.
I will see you soon.

1205
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:48,745
Yeah. Okay.

1206
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,647
Okay, Yeah.

1207
01:03:50,681 --> 01:03:52,549
Yes, got to go.
Okay. Bye.

1208
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:54,618
What's the schedule tomorrow?

1209
01:03:54,651 --> 01:03:57,154
- You have a very light day.
- I mean Dobson.

1210
01:03:57,187 --> 01:03:58,689
You won't be needed for that.

1211
01:03:58,722 --> 01:04:00,524
All of the interviews
are supposed to go through me.

1212
01:04:00,557 --> 01:04:02,225
All the law enforcement
interviews were to be

1213
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:03,594
scheduled through you,
and they were.

1214
01:04:03,627 --> 01:04:05,162
What the heck are you trying
to pull here?

1215
01:04:05,195 --> 01:04:06,430
I'm just trying
to give my client a chance

1216
01:04:06,463 --> 01:04:08,465
to tell his side of the story.

1217
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:10,200
Do you think Dobson will
petition the government for...

1218
01:04:10,233 --> 01:04:12,703
Dr. Dobson
is a very well connected man.

1219
01:04:12,736 --> 01:04:14,671
- We said no media.
- And he knows the rules.

1220
01:04:14,705 --> 01:04:16,139
He just wants to talk to him.

1221
01:04:16,173 --> 01:04:17,641
Ted will tell him what
he wants to hear.

1222
01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:20,344
- He wants a poster boy.
- And we'll give it to him.

1223
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,821
Dr. Dobson, this is
Special Agent Bill Hagmaier.

1224
01:04:29,854 --> 01:04:31,521
- Special Agent.
- Doctor.

1225
01:04:31,555 --> 01:04:33,423
It's good to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

1226
01:04:33,457 --> 01:04:35,425
You're doing
the Lord's work here.

1227
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:37,160
We've done what we can.

1228
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:38,362
But we still have
a lot of investigators

1229
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:40,597
left to squeeze in.

1230
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:43,367
Well, your two hours
are counting down.

1231
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,802
I won't keep you.

1232
01:04:48,906 --> 01:04:50,942
Carolyn, I'm going
to check on our setup.

1233
01:04:50,975 --> 01:04:53,710
Mm-hmm.
- Get me something to drink.

1234
01:04:53,744 --> 01:04:55,445
That was rude.

1235
01:04:55,479 --> 01:04:57,514
How long of an interview
can he get with all the setup?

1236
01:04:57,547 --> 01:04:58,749
The setup doesn't count.

1237
01:04:58,783 --> 01:05:00,617
What do you mean
it doesn't count?

1238
01:05:00,651 --> 01:05:02,185
This is a real production.

1239
01:05:02,219 --> 01:05:03,755
You don't just
point a camera and shoot.

1240
01:05:03,788 --> 01:05:06,690
How long?

1241
01:05:06,723 --> 01:05:07,892
We have seven hours blocked.

1242
01:05:07,925 --> 01:05:10,394
- Seven hours?!
- Correct.

1243
01:05:12,462 --> 01:05:13,965
He's guilty.

1244
01:05:13,998 --> 01:05:18,468
This won't help anyone.

1245
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:20,270
Excuse me.

1246
01:05:26,944 --> 01:05:30,547
You are guilty of
killing many women and girls.

1247
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:33,650
Is that correct?

1248
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:35,385
Yes.

1249
01:05:35,419 --> 01:05:37,354
Yes, that's true.

1250
01:05:39,757 --> 01:05:42,492
Ted, how did it happen?

1251
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:43,660
Take me back.

1252
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:46,663
So much grief, so much sorrow,

1253
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:49,934
so much pain for so many people.

1254
01:05:49,967 --> 01:05:51,334
Where did it start?

1255
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:54,237
How did this moment come about?

1256
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:57,407
That's part
of the tragedy

1257
01:05:57,441 --> 01:05:59,509
of this whole situation,

1258
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:02,780
because I grew up
in a wonderful home

1259
01:06:02,814 --> 01:06:06,583
with two dedicated
and loving parents.

1260
01:06:06,616 --> 01:06:10,888
I'm one of five
brothers and sisters.

1261
01:06:10,922 --> 01:06:14,792
But AS a boy,

1262
01:06:14,826 --> 01:06:17,028
and I...

1263
01:06:17,061 --> 01:06:22,566
and I mean 12, 13...

1264
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:24,735
I encountered,

1265
01:06:24,769 --> 01:06:26,603
outside of the home again,

1266
01:06:26,636 --> 01:06:30,041
in the local grocery stores,

1267
01:06:30,074 --> 01:06:32,476
the local drugstores,

1268
01:06:32,509 --> 01:06:35,913
soft core pornography.

1269
01:06:35,947 --> 01:06:37,481
Soft core,

1270
01:06:37,514 --> 01:06:40,584
What people call soft core.

1271
01:06:40,617 --> 01:06:44,721
And as I think I explained
to you last night, Dr. Dobson,

1272
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:48,025
an anecdote, as boys do,

1273
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:53,396
we would explore
the back roads and sideways

1274
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:55,800
and byways of our neighborhood.

1275
01:06:55,833 --> 01:07:00,037
And oftentimes,
people would dump the garbage

1276
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:03,340
or whatever they were clearing
out of their house.

1277
01:07:03,373 --> 01:07:06,077
From time to time,
we'd come across

1278
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:08,678
old pornographic books

1279
01:07:08,712 --> 01:07:11,615
of a harder, more explicit,

1280
01:07:11,648 --> 01:07:13,350
graphic nature

1281
01:07:13,383 --> 01:07:14,886
than what we'd encounter

1282
01:07:14,919 --> 01:07:17,989
in, say,
your local grocery store.

1283
01:07:18,022 --> 01:07:19,891
And this included such things

1284
01:07:19,924 --> 01:07:22,325
as detective magazines.

1285
01:07:22,359 --> 01:07:24,494
Those involved violence.

1286
01:07:24,528 --> 01:07:28,099
Yes, this is something
I want to emphasize,

1287
01:07:28,132 --> 01:07:29,733
is the... the...

1288
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:33,537
the most damaging kinds
of pornography in...

1289
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:37,507
And again, I'm talking
from personal experience here,

1290
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:41,913
hard real personal experience,

1291
01:07:41,946 --> 01:07:46,050
are those that involve violence,
sexual violence,

1292
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:49,753
because of the wedding
of those two forces,

1293
01:07:49,787 --> 01:07:53,891
I only know too well,

1294
01:07:53,925 --> 01:07:58,428
brings out a behavior
that is just...

1295
01:07:58,461 --> 01:08:02,566
too terrible to describe.

1296
01:08:02,599 --> 01:08:05,502
We are your sons,
and we are your husbands,

1297
01:08:05,535 --> 01:08:08,605
and we grew up
in regular families.

1298
01:08:08,638 --> 01:08:11,943
And pornography can reach out

1299
01:08:11,976 --> 01:08:15,046
and snatch a kid out
of any house.

1300
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:17,480
It snatched me out of my home

1301
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:19,549
20, 30 years ago.

1302
01:08:25,957 --> 01:08:28,525
...as good a Christian home...

1303
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:54,185
Were you happy
with the interview.

1304
01:08:54,218 --> 01:08:55,887
Very.

1305
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,990
His message is going
to go out to the world

1306
01:08:59,023 --> 01:09:02,459
and save untold thousands
of lives and souls.

1307
01:09:02,492 --> 01:09:05,196
- And the governor?
- Is going to love this.

1308
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:07,530
So, you'll talk to him.

1309
01:09:11,635 --> 01:09:14,805
The governor was never
going to pardon him.

1310
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:17,607
He's a murderer.

1311
01:09:17,641 --> 01:09:19,844
But now he can go on
to meet the Lord

1312
01:09:19,877 --> 01:09:23,647
with a clean soul
and an unburdened heart.

1313
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,750
Thank you for this
tremendous experience.

1314
01:09:26,784 --> 01:09:28,752
This is going
to change lives.

1315
01:09:28,786 --> 01:09:31,688
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go across the street.

1316
01:09:31,721 --> 01:09:33,224
No, we had
an agreement. No press!

1317
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:34,524
This is too big.

1318
01:09:34,557 --> 01:09:35,860
The world needs to know why

1319
01:09:35,893 --> 01:09:37,594
he killed those girls.

1320
01:09:37,627 --> 01:09:39,496
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Bill.

1321
01:09:39,529 --> 01:09:40,865
Yeah, hi. It's me.

1322
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:43,801
I need everyone down here ASAP.

1323
01:10:11,095 --> 01:10:13,998
<i>Today in Florida,
a notorious serial killer is</i>

1324
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:17,101
<i>sustaining a string of very
last-minute confessions.</i>

1325
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:20,737
<i>Ted Bundy is trying
to stay his execution,</i>

1326
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:23,673
<i>which is scheduled for tomorrow
in the electric chair.</i>

1327
01:10:23,707 --> 01:10:25,642
<i>Ted Bundy has now confessed
to at least some</i>

1328
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:27,711
<i>of the violent murders
he's suspected of,</i>

1329
01:10:27,744 --> 01:10:30,647
<i>bringing some measure of relief
to the victims families.</i>

1330
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,549
<i>Jennifer Strother
was a co-worker</i>

1331
01:10:32,582 --> 01:10:35,286
<i>of Julie Cunningham,
a Vale ski shop employee</i>

1332
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:37,021
<i>Bundy has confessed to killing.</i>

1333
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:53,804
Bill. Word?

1334
01:10:56,907 --> 01:10:59,977
Bundy's people are calling
for a sanity hearing.

1335
01:11:00,011 --> 01:11:03,247
Well, that's straight
out of the playbook.

1336
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,982
Governor will send down
his people,

1337
01:11:05,016 --> 01:11:06,549
who will find him sane,

1338
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,618
as the governor
has instructed them to do.

1339
01:11:08,651 --> 01:11:10,921
And then, of course,
Carolyn will call in her team

1340
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:12,655
of heavy hitters,
who will...

1341
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:14,724
They'll find him nuts,
whether he is or not.

1342
01:11:14,759 --> 01:11:16,626
Whether he is or not.

1343
01:11:16,659 --> 01:11:18,129
So, it will come down

1344
01:11:18,162 --> 01:11:20,898
to any interviewing
law enforcement officials

1345
01:11:20,931 --> 01:11:24,068
who spent significant time
with him.

1346
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,010
You're saying I'm the guy
that's actually gonna decide

1347
01:11:33,044 --> 01:11:35,079
whether or not
he gets the chair.

1348
01:11:35,112 --> 01:11:39,283
It's a hell of a thing
to put on to a man, but yes.

1349
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,889
That's who you want
to be president.

1350
01:11:44,922 --> 01:11:46,623
Former head of the CIA.
That's who you want.

1351
01:11:46,656 --> 01:11:48,959
Some one who knows
what it's like on the ground.

1352
01:11:48,993 --> 01:11:51,362
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- You know?

1353
01:11:51,395 --> 01:11:54,098
- Get stuff done.
- Get it done. Get it done.

1354
01:11:54,131 --> 01:11:56,333
Hey, Bill, you've met
Assistant Warden Decker, right?

1355
01:11:56,367 --> 01:11:59,970
Yeah, I think we met at
the Crime in America conference.

1356
01:12:00,004 --> 01:12:01,604
I don't remember.

1357
01:12:01,638 --> 01:12:04,641
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

1358
01:12:04,674 --> 01:12:06,709
<i>Ted Bundy has 13 hours to live,</i>

1359
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:10,214
<i>and he is using those hours to
try to buy himself more time.</i>

1360
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:12,183
<i>Shortly after 2:30
this afternoon,</i>

1361
01:12:12,216 --> 01:12:15,052
<i>a diesel engine that will
power tomorrow's execution</i>

1362
01:12:15,086 --> 01:12:17,822
<i>arrived at the Florida
State Prison for testing,</i>

1363
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:20,758
<i>showing the first signs
of what is to come.</i>

1364
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:24,995
You said he wanted to
do something for the families.

1365
01:12:25,029 --> 01:12:27,064
You don't exactly have a lot
of time left to do that.

1366
01:12:27,098 --> 01:12:29,900
We're still
waiting on the court.

1367
01:12:32,436 --> 01:12:34,205
<i>...Bundy T-shirts for sale.</i>

1368
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:36,639
<i>This one says,
"Burn, Bundy, Burn."</i>

1369
01:12:36,673 --> 01:12:38,409
<i>And the vendor says
business is good.</i>

1370
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:41,011
<i>I'm not making a lot
of money on this.</i>

1371
01:12:41,045 --> 01:12:42,379
<i>But I'm getting
the message out.</i>

1372
01:12:53,224 --> 01:12:54,925
And they say I'm crazy.

1373
01:12:58,762 --> 01:13:01,999
The governor isn't gonna call.

1374
01:13:02,032 --> 01:13:04,401
This is it, right?

1375
01:13:04,435 --> 01:13:08,873
The governor has identified
three psychiatrists, good ones.

1376
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,774
They're interviewing staff,
administrators,

1377
01:13:10,808 --> 01:13:12,943
anyone who's come
in contact with you

1378
01:13:12,977 --> 01:13:14,879
to ask
if they've noticed any change

1379
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:16,380
in your behavior
over the last week.

1380
01:13:16,413 --> 01:13:18,182
Well, that's alright.

1381
01:13:22,419 --> 01:13:24,822
They're gonna ask you.

1382
01:13:24,855 --> 01:13:26,190
I mean, who have you
spent more time with

1383
01:13:26,223 --> 01:13:27,758
over the last three days?

1384
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:30,327
And if you tell them
that I'm not crazy...

1385
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:32,763
I'll be executed.

1386
01:13:32,796 --> 01:13:35,698
That is the likeliest outcome.

1387
01:13:51,215 --> 01:13:53,784
I need to make a phone call.

1388
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:54,985
Yeah, you have
all the calls...

1389
01:13:55,019 --> 01:13:56,320
To my mother.

1390
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:01,759
What the hell do I say to her,
Bill?

1391
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:05,362
- I don't know how to...
- You tell the truth.

1392
01:14:05,396 --> 01:14:08,731
You apologize.
You say you're sorry.

1393
01:14:12,102 --> 01:14:14,305
Write her a letter.

1394
01:14:14,338 --> 01:14:16,273
I don't know how
to write that, Bill.

1395
01:14:30,287 --> 01:14:33,090
Alright.
Let's work this out.

1396
01:14:44,301 --> 01:14:46,170
Here you go.

1397
01:14:46,203 --> 01:14:50,374
Well, you're asking me
to do something.

1398
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:54,878
Just start with, "Dear Mom."

1399
01:15:01,952 --> 01:15:03,487
Dear...

1400
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,923
How long's it been
since you've talked to her?

1401
01:15:09,994 --> 01:15:12,263
- Three years.
- We'll start with that.

1402
01:15:34,118 --> 01:15:36,553
You only have a few hours left.

1403
01:15:39,356 --> 01:15:41,292
What did you have in mind?

1404
01:15:44,194 --> 01:15:47,264
You told me once,
when you were ready,

1405
01:15:47,298 --> 01:15:50,367
you'd take me under the water.

1406
01:15:50,401 --> 01:15:53,137
I did.

1407
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:54,405
So...

1408
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,208
...where are we going?

1409
01:16:01,612 --> 01:16:03,314
I'm, uh...

1410
01:16:03,347 --> 01:16:04,348
pretty tired.

1411
01:16:04,381 --> 01:16:05,916
I think I should get some rest

1412
01:16:05,949 --> 01:16:08,519
before the morning.

1413
01:16:08,552 --> 01:16:10,254
Ted...

1414
01:16:10,287 --> 01:16:12,489
you said you wanted to confess,

1415
01:16:12,523 --> 01:16:14,058
tell the truth.

1416
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:16,126
You can't get right with God,

1417
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,063
holding all that in.

1418
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:23,033
If you consider me a friend...

1419
01:17:07,311 --> 01:17:10,547
I'm going to...

1420
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:13,650
take you somewhere...

1421
01:17:13,684 --> 01:17:17,187
that I've never
taken anyone before.

1422
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:23,160
And I will do the talking.

1423
01:17:38,442 --> 01:17:40,310
She's...

1424
01:17:40,344 --> 01:17:42,045
beautiful.

1425
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:44,114
She's....

1426
01:17:44,148 --> 01:17:46,250
radiant.

1427
01:17:48,018 --> 01:17:50,454
And very familiar.

1428
01:17:52,556 --> 01:17:55,125
Her dad is sick.

1429
01:17:55,159 --> 01:17:56,427
He's, uh...

1430
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:58,495
He's in and out of the hospital.

1431
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:01,265
I hear her talking about it

1432
01:18:01,298 --> 01:18:04,468
over a pay phone.

1433
01:18:04,501 --> 01:18:08,105
He has heart problems.

1434
01:18:08,138 --> 01:18:09,640
I have a badge

1435
01:18:09,673 --> 01:18:12,075
that I got in the usual way,

1436
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:15,179
a local police badge.

1437
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:17,414
And tonight...

1438
01:18:17,448 --> 01:18:20,017
full moon.

1439
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:21,552
She looks amazing.

1440
01:18:21,585 --> 01:18:24,588
She's exactly like one
of the girls from the magazines.

1441
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:26,657
- The detective magazines.
- Spitting image.

1442
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:28,559
Walk up to her.

1443
01:18:28,592 --> 01:18:30,627
I'm Officer Ted,

1444
01:18:30,661 --> 01:18:32,196
Officer Ted Bundy.

1445
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:33,430
Something's happened.

1446
01:18:33,464 --> 01:18:35,332
She goes pale.
"What do you mean?"

1447
01:18:35,365 --> 01:18:37,000
"Your father's
had a heart attack.

1448
01:18:37,034 --> 01:18:39,636
I was sent to find you.
My car is over this way."

1449
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:42,105
She rushes with me.
It all happened so fast.

1450
01:18:42,139 --> 01:18:44,408
She doesn't have time
to clock the police officer

1451
01:18:44,441 --> 01:18:46,376
is picking her up
in a Volkswagen.

1452
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:48,312
I open the door for her.

1453
01:18:48,345 --> 01:18:51,448
Before she realizes there's
no passenger seat, wham!

1454
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:53,083
I hit her
in the back of the head

1455
01:18:53,116 --> 01:18:55,319
with a tire iron.

1456
01:18:55,352 --> 01:18:56,520
She's out.

1457
01:18:56,553 --> 01:18:59,456
Isn't she beautiful?

1458
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:02,059
Her dark hair parted
down the middle.

1459
01:19:02,092 --> 01:19:04,796
Gorgeous.

1460
01:19:04,829 --> 01:19:07,631
I want her so bad.

1461
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:09,399
But no.

1462
01:19:09,433 --> 01:19:11,635
Not yet.

1463
01:19:11,668 --> 01:19:15,105
<i>Stick to the plan.
Just a few more miles.</i>

1464
01:19:15,138 --> 01:19:17,674
<i>You can do whatever you want.</i>

1465
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:21,144
<i>The air is cold.
It's crisp.</i>

1466
01:19:21,178 --> 01:19:22,646
Now we're there.
We're there.

1467
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,214
I drag her out of the car.

1468
01:19:24,248 --> 01:19:25,582
I drag her through the woods

1469
01:19:25,616 --> 01:19:28,352
to the place I have
all picked out.

1470
01:19:28,385 --> 01:19:29,553
That spot.

1471
01:19:29,586 --> 01:19:31,789
She's lying there
in the moonlight.

1472
01:19:31,823 --> 01:19:34,391
Her curves, her skin,
her blouse.

1473
01:19:34,424 --> 01:19:36,460
I can see her curves.

1474
01:19:39,864 --> 01:19:41,732
...don't get caught.
That's how you don't get caught.

1475
01:19:41,766 --> 01:19:43,801
I need my kit.
It's in the car.

1476
01:19:43,835 --> 01:19:47,271
Back of the wheel well.
Get rid of it after I'm done.

1477
01:19:47,304 --> 01:19:49,339
Never use the same kit twice.
That's you get caught.

1478
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:50,808
You didn't let them
catch you with it.

1479
01:19:50,842 --> 01:19:52,743
You got to know
where to drop it.

1480
01:19:52,777 --> 01:19:55,412
...and I undress her.

1481
01:19:57,481 --> 01:20:00,551
I wrap the garrot
around her neck.

1482
01:20:00,584 --> 01:20:04,354
And I bend her over.

1483
01:20:04,388 --> 01:20:07,457
And I wake her with
the smelling salts.

1484
01:20:07,491 --> 01:20:10,394
And she wakes, and she screams.

1485
01:20:10,427 --> 01:20:12,797
Shhhhhh!

1486
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:15,399
"Please, please, please,
don't do this."

1487
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:17,634
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1488
01:20:17,668 --> 01:20:21,438
- Just be quiet.
- Please, don't do this.

1489
01:20:21,471 --> 01:20:25,242
I live out all the fantasies.

1490
01:20:25,275 --> 01:20:26,610
I fuck her until I...

1491
01:20:26,643 --> 01:20:28,178
...I've ever dreamed of.

1492
01:20:28,211 --> 01:20:29,379
It's just that moment.

1493
01:20:29,413 --> 01:20:31,783
I wrap the garrot tighter.

1494
01:20:31,816 --> 01:20:32,884
I wring her neck.

1495
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:34,551
I choke her.
She's bucking.

1496
01:20:34,585 --> 01:20:37,154
She's gasping.

1497
01:20:38,221 --> 01:20:41,793
Oh!

1498
01:20:41,826 --> 01:20:44,896
I feel her going limp.

1499
01:20:44,929 --> 01:20:47,832
And...

1500
01:20:47,865 --> 01:20:49,600
I wrap her...

1501
01:20:49,633 --> 01:20:51,668
I wrap my arms around her.

1502
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:01,545
And I turn her around.

1503
01:21:05,382 --> 01:21:08,619
And I kiss her.

1504
01:21:08,652 --> 01:21:12,589
I swallow her last breath whole.

1505
01:21:16,259 --> 01:21:19,162
She knows.

1506
01:21:19,196 --> 01:21:21,398
She knows...

1507
01:21:21,431 --> 01:21:23,634
that it's her last moments
on earth.

1508
01:21:23,667 --> 01:21:25,870
- And she's mine.
- This is it.

1509
01:21:25,903 --> 01:21:27,772
This is it.

1510
01:21:27,805 --> 01:21:29,841
She's mine.

1511
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:17,220
We went out for food.

1512
01:22:17,254 --> 01:22:20,490
But nothing was open this late
but a gas station.

1513
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:22,626
Thanks.

1514
01:22:27,597 --> 01:22:29,366
So, what'd he tell you?

1515
01:22:39,443 --> 01:22:40,711
Special agent.

1516
01:22:40,744 --> 01:22:42,612
Governor's team
is ready for you now.

1517
01:22:46,784 --> 01:22:48,652
Alright.

1518
01:22:48,685 --> 01:22:51,989
I think we have
everything we need.

1519
01:22:55,026 --> 01:22:57,929
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1520
01:22:57,962 --> 01:23:00,697
Thank you for your time,
Agent Hagmaier.

1521
01:23:28,391 --> 01:23:30,061
I failed.

1522
01:23:32,696 --> 01:23:35,833
No one could've saved him
after what he's done.

1523
01:23:38,735 --> 01:23:41,605
Carolyn...

1524
01:23:41,638 --> 01:23:43,841
you need to go home
to your husband,

1525
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:47,011
go home to your kids,
get some sleep?

1526
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:50,782
Has anyone ever told you

1527
01:23:50,815 --> 01:23:53,450
that you need to go home
to your kids?

1528
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:03,560
I know what people say.

1529
01:24:03,593 --> 01:24:06,663
The guards, everyone.

1530
01:24:07,664 --> 01:24:09,533
About Ted and I.

1531
01:24:09,566 --> 01:24:11,035
People say things.

1532
01:24:11,068 --> 01:24:12,937
You want to know what
I think about Ted Bundy?

1533
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:16,908
I will tell you.
I hate him.

1534
01:24:16,941 --> 01:24:22,612
I... I think I hate him more
than anybody I've ever hated.

1535
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:23,915
Then why defend him?

1536
01:24:23,948 --> 01:24:27,384
Because murder is murder,

1537
01:24:27,417 --> 01:24:30,121
and... in the end,

1538
01:24:30,154 --> 01:24:33,758
we all have to be accountable
for what we've done,

1539
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:35,993
and that includes me
as much as it includes Ted,

1540
01:24:36,027 --> 01:24:37,962
and it includes you, too,

1541
01:24:39,663 --> 01:24:40,998
Whether you realize it or not,

1542
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:42,900
you just helped pull
the trigger in there.

1543
01:24:42,934 --> 01:24:44,969
It's between him and God now.

1544
01:24:45,002 --> 01:24:48,605
I just told the truth.

1545
01:24:48,638 --> 01:24:52,676
Him and God. Right.

1546
01:24:57,081 --> 01:24:59,549
God is what gets you
through this?

1547
01:25:03,453 --> 01:25:05,122
Goodbye, Bill.

1548
01:25:13,597 --> 01:25:16,499
"He maketh me to
lie down in green pastures.

1549
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:19,436
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

1550
01:25:19,469 --> 01:25:21,671
He restoreth my soul.

1551
01:25:21,705 --> 01:25:24,041
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness

1552
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:25,776
for His name's sake.

1553
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:27,444
Yea, though I walk

1554
01:25:27,477 --> 01:25:29,013
through the valley
of the shadow of death,

1555
01:25:29,046 --> 01:25:32,850
I will fear no evil:
for thou art with me;

1556
01:25:32,884 --> 01:25:34,751
thy rod and thy staff..."

1557
01:25:34,785 --> 01:25:39,924
Look down and give
comfort to your son, Ted,

1558
01:25:39,957 --> 01:25:42,692
As he prepares to make
his final...

1559
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:45,129
Oh, no! No!

1560
01:25:45,162 --> 01:25:47,031
In a place where thine...

1561
01:25:47,064 --> 01:25:48,598
The Lord of hosts.

1562
01:25:48,632 --> 01:25:50,167
He is the king of glory.

1563
01:25:55,873 --> 01:25:59,810
I can't fucking hear anything!

1564
01:26:04,849 --> 01:26:09,486
♪ And praiseth me ♪

1565
01:26:12,622 --> 01:26:17,494
♪ My song shall be... ♪

1566
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:39,850
I wanted
to say something.

1567
01:26:39,884 --> 01:26:42,752
You know, while I still can.

1568
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:49,592
Thanks for being here,

1569
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:51,728
for being a friend.

1570
01:26:54,098 --> 01:26:57,634
Everyone always wanted
something from me.

1571
01:26:57,667 --> 01:26:59,203
I was a noteworthy client,

1572
01:26:59,236 --> 01:27:03,707
or... or... or another brick
on their road to salvation

1573
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:07,845
or a name on their cover
to sell a book, but...

1574
01:27:10,047 --> 01:27:12,615
But you...

1575
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:16,586
all you ever wanted from me
was to understand.

1576
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:19,522
And that's all a friend is.

1577
01:27:19,556 --> 01:27:23,660
You know, someone
who wants to understand.

1578
01:27:23,693 --> 01:27:25,830
All they want to believe
is that the worst person

1579
01:27:25,863 --> 01:27:27,798
in the world got smoked?

1580
01:27:32,069 --> 01:27:34,972
You know what?
Screw that.

1581
01:27:35,006 --> 01:27:37,741
I'm not gonna give the state
the satisfaction of killing me.

1582
01:27:37,775 --> 01:27:40,845
They can bury me if they want,
but they can't kill me.

1583
01:27:40,878 --> 01:27:42,046
You see this pen?!

1584
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:43,713
I can put this in my arm
right now.

1585
01:27:43,747 --> 01:27:45,816
I can bleed out before
anybody gets in here.

1586
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:48,219
I've researched it.
I've seen other guys do it.

1587
01:27:48,252 --> 01:27:50,888
- I can do it.
- You don't think I trust you?

1588
01:27:50,921 --> 01:27:52,256
What, you want me
to grab that pen

1589
01:27:52,289 --> 01:27:54,691
and stop you from
killing yourself right now?

1590
01:27:54,724 --> 01:27:56,761
I'm not gonna do it.

1591
01:27:56,794 --> 01:27:59,864
If that's your plan...

1592
01:27:59,897 --> 01:28:02,099
But you wanted to do some good
before you went.

1593
01:28:02,133 --> 01:28:03,300
And I've done it.
I've done all I can.

1594
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:06,070
- You said so yourself.
- Not all.

1595
01:28:06,103 --> 01:28:07,805
Those families,

1596
01:28:07,838 --> 01:28:11,142
they need to know that you
died for their daughter.

1597
01:28:11,175 --> 01:28:13,110
Each one of them independently
is going to believe

1598
01:28:13,144 --> 01:28:15,612
that you died
for <i>their</i> daughter.

1599
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:20,284
That's why you have
to die in the morning.

1600
01:28:20,317 --> 01:28:22,086
It's for <i>them.</i>

1601
01:28:28,359 --> 01:28:30,761
What's gonna happen to me?

1602
01:28:30,795 --> 01:28:32,729
I don't know.

1603
01:28:55,219 --> 01:28:57,188
I can't get what
I need from here.

1604
01:28:57,221 --> 01:28:58,823
What do you mean?

1605
01:28:58,856 --> 01:29:00,357
I have been reading
this fucking thing.

1606
01:29:00,391 --> 01:29:02,659
I just don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

1607
01:29:02,692 --> 01:29:06,130
Well, what we do know is you're
going to die in the morning,

1608
01:29:06,163 --> 01:29:08,332
and there will be
a final judgment.

1609
01:29:08,365 --> 01:29:11,102
How am I going
to explain all this to God?

1610
01:29:11,135 --> 01:29:14,205
There's a thing called remorse,

1611
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:17,141
a thing called repentance.

1612
01:29:17,174 --> 01:29:20,778
Salvation has to come
from within first.

1613
01:29:20,811 --> 01:29:23,948
You're not gonna be able to lie
your way out of this one, Ted.

1614
01:29:27,184 --> 01:29:29,220
Seven days!

1615
01:29:29,253 --> 01:29:31,654
That fucking governor...
he gave me seven days!

1616
01:29:31,688 --> 01:29:33,357
It could've been 30.
It could've been 60!

1617
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,259
I could have had some time
to do some good.

1618
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:37,328
I could have had time
to figure out how to live.

1619
01:29:37,361 --> 01:29:38,728
But that selfish bastard,

1620
01:29:38,762 --> 01:29:40,431
he wanted to put
a notch on his desk.

1621
01:29:40,464 --> 01:29:44,068
"I'm the guy who fried him!"
That motherfucker!

1622
01:29:44,101 --> 01:29:46,837
They want to kill me
for their own satisfaction,

1623
01:29:46,871 --> 01:29:48,372
all so they can feel better,

1624
01:29:48,405 --> 01:29:50,975
but they are not better than me.

1625
01:29:51,008 --> 01:29:54,411
They are not better than me!

1626
01:29:54,445 --> 01:29:57,181
Why, Bill?!

1627
01:29:57,214 --> 01:29:59,083
Why did this happen to me?

1628
01:29:59,116 --> 01:30:01,385
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1629
01:30:01,418 --> 01:30:03,454
You're asking me,
so I'm gonna tell you right now!

1630
01:30:03,487 --> 01:30:05,356
How many of your victims
had the opportunity

1631
01:30:05,389 --> 01:30:06,924
that you have, huh?!

1632
01:30:06,957 --> 01:30:10,194
To prepare for death,
to call your mom?

1633
01:30:10,227 --> 01:30:13,130
You don't even know
how many girls there even were!

1634
01:30:13,164 --> 01:30:15,366
All those children!

1635
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:17,168
All those children who died!

1636
01:30:17,201 --> 01:30:18,769
They weren't all children.
Most of them were women...

1637
01:30:18,802 --> 01:30:20,304
They were all somebody's child,
Ted!

1638
01:30:20,337 --> 01:30:22,206
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're somebody's child.

1639
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:24,341
Yeah.

1640
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:31,048
You're pissed at me, aren't you?

1641
01:30:31,081 --> 01:30:32,416
Yeah.

1642
01:30:32,449 --> 01:30:33,951
Yes, I am.

1643
01:30:33,984 --> 01:30:35,319
You think they should kill me,
don't you?

1644
01:30:35,352 --> 01:30:37,288
You think it's my turn to die.

1645
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:42,860
Frankly, they probably should've
done it a long time ago.

1646
01:30:51,135 --> 01:30:53,237
I have to pray.

1647
01:31:00,477 --> 01:31:02,413
Mr. Hagmaier.

1648
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,851
It's time.

1649
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:22,399
Will I see you out there?

1650
01:31:22,433 --> 01:31:24,201
Yes.

1651
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:30,307
Did you get what
you came here for?

1652
01:31:30,341 --> 01:31:32,109
Do you know why I did it?

1653
01:31:37,047 --> 01:31:40,117
Because you wanted to.

1654
01:31:46,257 --> 01:31:48,525
I hope to see you
on the other side.

1655
01:31:52,563 --> 01:31:54,498
Could be.

1656
01:32:20,891 --> 01:32:26,030
♪ Na na na na,
hey hey, goodbye ♪

1657
01:32:26,063 --> 01:32:33,971
♪ Na na na na,
hey hey, goodbye ♪

1658
01:32:34,004 --> 01:32:36,540
Florida State Prison.

1659
01:32:36,573 --> 01:32:37,975
I'm sorry.

1660
01:32:38,008 --> 01:32:41,412
He's not available
at the moment.

1661
01:32:41,445 --> 01:32:44,248
I'll be sure
to give the message.

1662
01:32:48,185 --> 01:32:50,554
Look, Bill.

1663
01:32:50,587 --> 01:32:53,857
The warden invited
a family down.

1664
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:56,293
- To watch?
- Yeah.

1665
01:32:56,327 --> 01:32:59,396
And they did a head count.

1666
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:02,866
I was supposed to have a seat.

1667
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,468
Florida State Prison.

1668
01:33:04,501 --> 01:33:07,304
I'm sorry. He's not available
at the moment.

1669
01:33:07,338 --> 01:33:08,872
I'll be sure
to give him the message.

1670
01:33:11,475 --> 01:33:13,877
It's the warden's discretion.

1671
01:33:13,911 --> 01:33:15,546
He must have a big family.

1672
01:33:15,579 --> 01:33:18,148
He does.

1673
01:33:18,182 --> 01:33:20,017
I'm sorry.

1674
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:21,218
They're ready for you, Paul.

1675
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:25,489
I got to walk him down.

1676
01:33:25,522 --> 01:33:27,057
Can you man the phones?

1677
01:33:27,091 --> 01:33:29,193
Yeah.

1678
01:33:35,366 --> 01:33:37,234
Florida State Prison.

1679
01:33:37,267 --> 01:33:39,303
Is Ted Bundy there.

1680
01:33:39,336 --> 01:33:41,238
I'm sorry. He's not available
at the moment.

1681
01:33:41,271 --> 01:33:43,974
<i>When you see him, will
you tell him, I smell bacon?!</i>

1682
01:34:08,999 --> 01:34:10,667
<i>Hello.
Hagmaier residence.</i>

1683
01:34:10,701 --> 01:34:12,202
Hey, sport.

1684
01:34:12,236 --> 01:34:14,438
<i>Oh, hi, Papa.
I'm so excited!</i>

1685
01:34:14,471 --> 01:34:16,206
<i>I wanted to tell you
about this thing that...</i>

1686
01:34:18,642 --> 01:34:20,344
That's great, buddy.

1687
01:34:20,377 --> 01:34:21,712
That's great.

1688
01:34:21,745 --> 01:34:23,280
Is Mama around?

1689
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:28,285
<i>There's more.</i>

1690
01:34:28,318 --> 01:34:31,221
<i>Like, the pirates
have all these swords.</i>

1691
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:38,462
That's wonderful, buddy.

1692
01:34:38,495 --> 01:34:41,231
Um, yeah, can you put
mama on the phone?

1693
