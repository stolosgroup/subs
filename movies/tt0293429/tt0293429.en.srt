3
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,246
Check it's tight.

4
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,348
Close your hand.

5
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:23,351
- Feel good?
- Good.

6
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:29,091
You made it.

7
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,726
Always rely on Cole Young.
Human punching bag.

8
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:36,130
- Who am I fighting?
- Fighting?

9
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,699
No, no, Cole.

10
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:42,770
Fighting requires both attacking and
defending, not just throwing punches.

11
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:44,805
You should try it sometime.

12
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,208
Now don't get sensitive.

13
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,310
You fight Ramirez.

14
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:50,679
He's, uh... Yeah.

15
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:53,648
He's experienced, fast,
a good fighter.

16
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:54,716
Who's your cornerman?

17
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,722
- You're fucking serious?
- You don't like it,

18
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:04,658
find someone else who'll do this
in an hour's notice for $200.

19
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:06,293
You're sticking around
for this one?

20
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:07,796
You know I don't watch him
fight anymore.

21
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:11,132
Yeah, well. Give the people
a good show, huh?

22
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,367
Or they won't
stick around either.

23
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:32,788
Throw your uppercut!

24
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:02,384
Ah!

25
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:28,644
Come on!

26
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:33,381
Don't tap out!

27
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,322
Done! Done!

28
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:42,524
- Pack it in.
- Yes!

29
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:15,889
The prophecy
is upon us,

30
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:18,460
which means we could lose
the tenth tournament.

31
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:22,496
There is
no prophecy.

32
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:28,870
Hanzo is a ghost.
I killed him centuries ago.

33
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:31,840
Winning Mortal Kombat
cannot be left to chance.

34
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,542
There will be no tournament

35
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:38,379
because there'll be
no opposition left to fight.

36
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:41,750
We will already
be victorious.

37
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:47,788
Go now and kill Earth Realm's
champions, Bi-Han.

38
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:52,793
I am no longer Bi-Han.
I am Sub-Zero.

39
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:36,637
Damn, Young.
You're a hell of a fighter, man.

40
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:37,905
- Thank you.
- Respect.

41
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:39,307
All right.

42
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,010
- Ready to go?
- In a sec.

43
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:45,547
What do you got there?

44
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:46,914
It's a string bracelet.

45
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,792
You just made this?

46
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:00,428
Yeah.

47
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:01,596
That's pretty cool.

48
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:02,630
Want me to put it on?

49
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:06,500
My hand.

50
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:10,338
Now, we got one each.

51
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:12,374
You're sure you're okay?

52
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:14,976
Yeah.

53
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:16,478
Guess I should have thrown
the uppercut, huh?

54
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:19,146
Cole Young.

55
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,516
The man that took the belt
from Eddie Tobias.

56
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:23,451
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

57
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:24,519
Have me met?

58
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,819
No.

59
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:26,988
Name's Jax.

60
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,455
Nice to meet you, Jax.

61
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:29,958
You could've won today,

62
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,725
had you controlled the cage.

63
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,027
Told you so.

64
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,063
She's smart.

65
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:38,133
All right, well,
time to go eat, yeah.

66
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:44,072
One more thing, champ.

67
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,576
That dragon logo you got...
I, I dig that, man.

68
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:50,577
It's unique.

69
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:51,613
Where'd you get it from?

70
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:52,946
He was born with it.

71
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,883
- What do you mean?
- It's a birthmark.

72
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,150
You serious?

73
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:57,519
Pretty cool. Show him.

74
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:07,729
Well, ain't that something.

75
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:08,797
Nice chatting with you.

76
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:11,432
See you around, champ.

77
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:15,971
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

78
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:18,673
Still in one piece.

79
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:20,741
How'd it go?

80
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,811
He was this close
to beating him.

81
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:24,179
- This close.
- Yes.

82
00:19:27,548 --> 00:19:28,650
You sure you're okay?

83
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:30,419
Standing.

84
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:32,988
- Let's go order.
- Yeah.

85
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,233
Got my eyes
on him right now.

86
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,736
He's got the mark, I saw it.

87
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:50,639
He's with his family.

88
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:14,996
Ally.

89
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,230
Come take a look at this.

90
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,231
It's snowing.

91
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,105
But it's July.

92
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:57,972
- Emily!
- Emily!

93
00:21:03,944 --> 00:21:05,679
Get in the truck, Cole!

94
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:07,181
Now!

95
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:09,884
- Come on, come on.
- Move, move, move, move.

96
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,706
Blade, I got him.

97
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:37,011
I'll see you at base at 2300.

98
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:40,581
What the fuck is that thing?

99
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:43,217
Funny. It didn't sound much
like thanks for saving my ass.

100
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,219
Whatever that was back there,

101
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:46,954
it's after both of us. Look.

102
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:48,923
That's, that's impossible.

103
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:53,260
It's not a birthmark, Cole.

104
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:58,333
- It means you've been chosen.
- Chosen, for what?

105
00:21:58,365 --> 00:22:00,835
- To fight.
- You got the wrong person, all right?

106
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,369
I'm not the fighter
that I used to be, okay.

107
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:04,939
No, shit.
But they don't have the marking.

108
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:06,941
So, like it or not Cole,
you're the guy.

109
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:09,009
As long as you got that marking
they're coming for you,

110
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:10,777
and they will kill
whoever they have to,

111
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,712
to get to you.

112
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:29,864
Take the truck.

113
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:31,098
Get your family to safety.

114
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:34,035
Cole?

115
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:37,404
You need to get
to Gary, Indiana.

116
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:40,942
Find Sonya Blade,
806 West Washington Boulevard.

117
00:22:40,974 --> 00:22:43,144
Are you sure?
We can take him out together.

118
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:46,146
You want your family on
a fucking slab in the morgue?

119
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,382
Now get out of here.

120
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:53,121
Hold on tight, guys.

121
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:02,763
So you wanna play
hide and seek.

122
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:09,230
Done six tours, motherfucker.

123
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,858
She's finally asleep.

124
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,499
I should go.

125
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,969
You'll be safe here, Ally.

126
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:57,304
You heard what Jax said.

127
00:25:57,337 --> 00:26:00,173
That thing is hunting
people with the marking.

128
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,143
It's after me.

129
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:04,311
And if I stay here
and it shows up,

130
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:05,547
it could kill us all.

131
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:07,915
I'm not gonna let that happen.

132
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:11,519
Jax could have killed it. I...

133
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:14,556
We have to be sure.

134
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,091
<i>The name he gave me,</i>

135
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:18,526
<i>Sonya Blade,</i>

136
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:19,894
<i>hopefully,
she'll have some answers.</i>

137
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:52,259
Master.

138
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,195
Sub-Zero tracked and killed

139
00:26:55,229 --> 00:26:57,265
another one
of Earth's champions.

140
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:59,000
But another has escaped.

141
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:01,534
Have our assassins
double the efforts.

142
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:03,037
What of Lord Raiden?

143
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:04,605
If he discovers
we're breaking rules

144
00:27:04,637 --> 00:27:06,173
set in stone
by the Elder Gods...

145
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:08,208
Leave the Elder Gods to me.

146
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,344
We didn't win
nine straight tournaments

147
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:12,145
by following the rules.

148
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,149
Mileena, let's finish this.

149
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:17,184
Send in the reptilian, Syzoth.

150
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:17,144
- What you doing here?
- Wait.

151
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:18,578
I'm looking for Sonya Blade.

152
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:20,281
Jax sent me.

153
00:28:20,314 --> 00:28:22,149
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

154
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:23,050
The marking.

155
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,125
I'm Sonya.

156
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,428
Jax hasn't checked in.
Where is he?

157
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:37,230
He stayed behind
to fight.

158
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:41,536
Close the door.

159
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,043
Jax, where are you?

160
00:28:52,546 --> 00:28:53,748
Come on.

161
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,582
You guys in military?

162
00:28:55,615 --> 00:28:56,550
Special forces.

163
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:04,125
Holy... What is this?

164
00:29:04,157 --> 00:29:06,593
We needed a safe place
to run our operation.

165
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:08,662
Well, this looks,
uh, pretty safe.

166
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:10,397
Looks like you're ready
for anything.

167
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:11,766
This is where we keep

168
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:13,367
all we've learned
about the dragon markings.

169
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:17,171
First learned about this
seven years ago.

170
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:18,806
Jax and I were on a mission
in Brazil

171
00:29:18,838 --> 00:29:20,740
to capture a wanted fugitive.

172
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:22,208
When we got there,

173
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:25,111
the target
had superhuman abilities.

174
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:28,148
Tore through our unit
in seconds.

175
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:31,317
The target had the same
marking you do, Cole.

176
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:33,387
When Jax finally took it down

177
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,258
the dragon marking transferred
directly onto his skin.

178
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,461
I spent years trying to
figure out what it all means.

179
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,096
It seems
that throughout history,

180
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,663
different cultures
all over the world,

181
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:46,299
they reference
a great tournament.

182
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:49,769
My research shows
that there's realms and species

183
00:29:49,803 --> 00:29:51,605
that we didn't
even know existed.

184
00:29:51,637 --> 00:29:53,307
That dragon marking,

185
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:54,574
it signifies
that you've been chosen

186
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:56,109
to fight for Earth.

187
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:57,478
It's an invitation...

188
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,047
to fight for something known

189
00:30:00,314 --> 00:30:01,516
as Mortal Kombat.

190
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:06,454
Did you make that last part up?

191
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:07,755
It just kind
of sounds like you made it up.

192
00:30:07,788 --> 00:30:09,423
I mean, and look,
they spelled it wrong.

193
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:10,824
Hey, you listen to me.

194
00:30:10,857 --> 00:30:12,792
I think there's another
tournament coming.

195
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:14,428
That's why you're here.

196
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:16,363
That is why Jax
and I have been tracking you

197
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:18,098
because we need to find
every last champion

198
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:19,400
before it's too late.

199
00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:21,501
And FYI, most of them
are dead already.

200
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:25,840
There's more to this, Cole.

201
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,242
I know it.

202
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:32,746
I swear to God, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

203
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:35,215
I hate to interrupt your bullshit, blondie.

204
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:37,284
But I gotta piss again.

205
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:39,120
What is this?
You have a visitor.

206
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:40,153
Careful, he bites.

207
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:46,594
Oh, hello, sunshine.

208
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:48,662
Who are you?

209
00:30:48,694 --> 00:30:50,530
- He's Kano.
- Kano?

210
00:30:51,464 --> 00:30:52,665
Kano, what?

211
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:54,634
Kano, none of your
fucking business.

212
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:57,403
Was that Russian?

213
00:30:57,436 --> 00:30:59,606
Do I sound Russian to you,
you fucking idiot?

214
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,809
He's a mercenary
with The Black Dragon clan.

215
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:03,878
Arms dealer, drug runner,

216
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:05,412
murder for hire,

217
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:06,746
scum of the Earth.

218
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,781
I also give
really good foot massages.

219
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:10,282
You have a marking.

220
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:11,819
Actually, that's kind of
a funny story.

221
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,554
You want to tell him?

222
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:15,221
I was tracking
another champion.

223
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:17,925
I was lucky enough
to find Kano here instead.

224
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,759
Right after he slit
the guy's throat.

225
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,828
You know, next time
be more punctual.

226
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:24,365
You were never chosen.

227
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:26,866
Fate has better standards
than you.

228
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,436
Lucky for you
I don't have any standards.

229
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,572
We'll see if you're a natural blonde.

230
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:37,177
Not bad.

231
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:39,646
Almost felt that one.

232
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:42,416
What about you?

233
00:31:42,449 --> 00:31:43,317
- Where's your marking?
- I don't have one.

234
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,358
Come on.

235
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:53,194
Hey, hey, new guy, new guy.

236
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:54,428
Get me out of here.
I could help you.

237
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,297
Just sit tight.

238
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:57,798
I was about to go for a stroll,

239
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,432
but maybe I'll stick around,
you fucking idiots.

240
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:33,634
What the fuck was that?

241
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:36,337
That was my knife, too!

242
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:38,405
Fucking poetry.

243
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:39,507
Where is it?

244
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:41,642
- Where?
- Shh.

245
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:02,263
Did you shoot it?

246
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:03,364
I thought I clipped it.

247
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:18,012
Sonya, are you okay?

248
00:33:21,948 --> 00:33:23,884
All right. I'm out of here.

249
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,490
Kano, use the flare!

250
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:38,031
There you are.

251
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:10,063
Knife.

252
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:30,650
Kano wins.

253
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:35,623
You fucking beauty.

254
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,968
Fucking A,

255
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:50,537
years of research
just destroyed.

256
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,972
So do you believe me now?

257
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:53,640
Yeah. What's the plan?

258
00:34:53,672 --> 00:34:54,674
There is none.

259
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:58,711
Oh, gee.

260
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:00,047
Make yourself at home.

261
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,414
Yeah, I have.

262
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:02,715
Oh, by the way,
you beer's shit,

263
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:03,750
and you're almost out of it.

264
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:11,090
What are you doing?

265
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:13,726
Just working on
a Kano graphic novel.

266
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,496
I fancy myself
a bit of an artist.

267
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,699
He's a psychopath.

268
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:20,668
All the best artists
are a little twisted, mate.

269
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:27,807
Well,

270
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:30,109
I'm off.

271
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:31,545
You're trying to get
to Raiden's temple, aren't you?

272
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:32,512
That should be fun.

273
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:34,748
You know where that is?

274
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,016
What's Raiden's temple?

275
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:37,550
Yeah, used to run
guns through there.

276
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,719
The locals
wouldn't shut the fuck up...

277
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:41,889
Legends says champions used
to train there for Mortal Kombat.

278
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,456
Ah, for fuck sake.

279
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:44,857
No one knows where it is.

280
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:46,059
Well, they do now.

281
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:47,728
- Excuse me.
- Where is it?

282
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,529
Uh, you got a pen?
You want to write this down?

283
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:50,597
Get fucked.

284
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,798
'Cause I'm not gonna help you.

285
00:35:51,831 --> 00:35:53,467
You kidnapped me.
You tied me up.

286
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,934
You threw a knife
through my fucking leg,

287
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,636
on purpose.

288
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,872
And then that lizard thing
took off half my face.

289
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:00,975
Lucky for me,
you can hardly notice it.

290
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:03,876
So yeah,
it's a hard pass for me

291
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:05,011
on the helping you thing.

292
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,715
And get out of me fucking way.

293
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:11,085
Okay.

294
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:13,019
There you go.

295
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:19,460
Everyone's got a price.

296
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:20,860
- Name yours.
- You can't afford me.

297
00:36:20,893 --> 00:36:21,828
Two million.

298
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:24,797
That's good.

299
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:26,066
You living in this shit hole

300
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,601
and you got
two million dollars.

301
00:36:27,634 --> 00:36:28,769
Pig's ass.

302
00:36:28,802 --> 00:36:30,137
I have lived here
my whole life.

303
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,472
You piece of shit.
You watch your mouth.

304
00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:33,606
Two million dollars.

305
00:36:36,842 --> 00:36:38,478
Yeah. No, fuck you.

306
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:40,815
Fuck it. Three million.

307
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,850
That's my final offer.

308
00:36:43,884 --> 00:36:45,952
And anything,
I find inside that temple

309
00:36:45,985 --> 00:36:48,154
I keep, no fucking splitsies.

310
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:49,990
Plus,
if you're bullshitting me,

311
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:51,492
I'll fucking kill you.

312
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:52,559
No skin off my sack.

313
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:55,829
Great.

314
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:58,030
Sounds like we got a deal.

315
00:36:58,063 --> 00:36:59,565
I was gonna head there anyway.

316
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,867
Yeah, fucking idiot.

317
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:05,072
How you planning
on getting us there?

318
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:06,940
Oh, I got a friend
with a plane.

319
00:37:06,972 --> 00:37:09,009
- You got friends?
- Eh, fuck you, pretty boy.

320
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:10,978
I'm a popular guy.

321
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:12,980
Everyone loves me.

322
00:37:19,686 --> 00:37:20,888
Ooh.

323
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:24,692
Oh, bloody garden gnomes,

324
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:26,860
they give me the creeps.

325
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:30,997
You're gonna give that guy
three million dollars?

326
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:33,032
Fuck, no.

327
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:34,300
I live in this shit hole.

328
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,268
You think
I got three million dollars?

329
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:04,231
There I was
trying to shove

330
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:06,199
this guy's nuts
down his throat.

331
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:07,800
And all I kept thinking about

332
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,602
is what should I get
for me mum for Christmas?

333
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:12,739
Your mom's been dead
for 30 fucking years, mate.

334
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:13,974
Kid can dream. Can't he?

335
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:16,342
Hey, you're out of it.

336
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:18,211
You okay?

337
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:20,814
- Yeah.
- All right.

338
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:22,282
Thank you for flying Air Kano,

339
00:38:22,315 --> 00:38:24,650
I know you had
fuck all choices.

340
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:25,852
Afraid time's up.

341
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:27,988
Time to jump out
of this shit box.

342
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:29,089
Come on, let's go.

343
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:36,228
First time?

344
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:37,931
Yeah. What gave it away?

345
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:39,099
You'll be okay.

346
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:41,034
Just gotta jump,
count to three,

347
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,835
pull this side.

348
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:44,637
All right. Simple. But how...

349
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,739
Well, do or die, princess.

350
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:48,909
- What?
- You're fucking kidding me.

351
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:00,220
So how close are we?

352
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:01,989
Twenty-seven,
twenty-eight K's.

353
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:03,155
What?

354
00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:04,657
Maybe thirty to be safe.

355
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,659
Straight up, thirty-two, eh?

356
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:08,729
We say thirty-five
there'll be no surprises.

357
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:11,664
Oh, shit.

358
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,669
Fuck this. I need a break.

359
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,706
You just took a break.

360
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:21,875
Too many beers, huh?

361
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:23,643
Give me that GPS.
I'm taking point.

362
00:39:23,677 --> 00:39:25,178
Ah, let's look
at the score board, shall we?

363
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,712
I got us the plane.

364
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:28,347
I know how to find

365
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,650
your precious little mountain
retreat or whatever it is.

366
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:32,052
I killed the lizard man.

367
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:35,989
Huh? Any of you rip
anyone's heart out? Hey.

368
00:39:36,021 --> 00:39:38,057
I think I know
what's going on here.

369
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,027
You're jealous, girlie,

370
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:41,293
of me little marking.

371
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:42,963
Hey, I'm talking to you.

372
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:45,432
If you want it so much,

373
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:47,000
all you got to do is kill me.

374
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:48,001
Take it.

375
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:51,405
Now, come on. What do you say?

376
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:52,640
You want to dance?

377
00:39:57,844 --> 00:39:59,413
- It's your blood.
- Attagirl.

378
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:01,148
Hmm.

379
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:15,896
Go on then, take it.

380
00:40:19,264 --> 00:40:20,833
You're so close.

381
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:22,836
Just take it. Take it!

382
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:27,340
Nah.

383
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:31,444
Yeah, that's why
you don't have one of these.

384
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:33,813
You don't have
the mongrel in you.

385
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:37,250
You good?

386
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:08,248
At last.

387
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:17,957
Okay, that's far enough,
MC Hammer.

388
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:23,797
I'm not your enemy.

389
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:29,436
I'm Liu Kang from
the Shaolin Order of Light.

390
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:31,137
You're one of
the champions.

391
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,105
Yes, from Earthrealm.

392
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:35,876
Finally, you have come
to seek out Raiden's...

393
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:37,943
Fuck the temple.

394
00:41:37,976 --> 00:41:41,080
Wait... You just shot
a fireball out of your hand.

395
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:42,115
How'd you do that?

396
00:41:44,217 --> 00:41:46,987
Hang on. Hang the fuck on.

397
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,523
Does that mean I'm gonna get
superpowers at any point?

398
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:50,523
It does, doesn't it?

399
00:41:52,425 --> 00:41:54,427
- There's much to learn.
- The fuck.

400
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,329
But not here.

401
00:41:56,396 --> 00:41:57,264
Follow me.

402
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:09,509
Hey, David Copperfield.
Hang on.

403
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:12,112
Just teach me
how you do it.

404
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:29,496
There it is...

405
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:31,030
what you've been
searching for.

406
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:37,237
It wasn't always
like this.

407
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:38,905
For thousands of years,

408
00:42:38,938 --> 00:42:42,342
this temple was a holy place
of worship.

409
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:46,579
It is essential that we begin your
training for the next tournament.

410
00:42:46,612 --> 00:42:48,581
This doesn't feel like
a tournament.

411
00:42:48,614 --> 00:42:50,850
So far it feels like an ambush.

412
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:52,853
We don't have much time.

413
00:42:52,885 --> 00:42:54,887
We will not see
another full moon

414
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,255
before the tournament begins.

415
00:43:03,663 --> 00:43:05,264
Come, come. Through here.

416
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:15,474
Now what?

417
00:43:15,507 --> 00:43:16,509
You're gonna make a door appear
out of nowhere?

418
00:43:23,615 --> 00:43:24,550
Oh.

419
00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:28,120
I'll give you that.
It's pretty good.

420
00:43:31,324 --> 00:43:32,192
Wow.

421
00:43:39,398 --> 00:43:40,400
I knew it.

422
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:43,903
It's all real.

423
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:47,072
These murals are the living
history of Mortal Kombat.

424
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:50,409
Now
this one really speaks to me.

425
00:43:54,313 --> 00:43:56,348
This is Outworld.

426
00:43:56,382 --> 00:43:59,019
Yes, the most brutal...

427
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:01,153
and murderous
of all the realms.

428
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:04,257
Our greatest enemy.

429
00:44:19,706 --> 00:44:22,575
We must
start training now.

430
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:26,246
Before our mortal enemies from
the Outworld come for us.

431
00:44:26,278 --> 00:44:30,150
The fate of Earthrealm
is in our hands.

432
00:44:30,182 --> 00:44:32,585
There are not many of us
with the marking left.

433
00:44:32,617 --> 00:44:35,454
So you must train harder,

434
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:37,489
and faster.

435
00:44:37,523 --> 00:44:40,626
Because if you fail
to discover your inner power,

436
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:44,063
you will never defeat
your opponent.

437
00:44:44,097 --> 00:44:48,535
They will ravage everything
you hold dear.

438
00:44:48,568 --> 00:44:52,005
There will be no mercy.

439
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:56,608
You must fight
without question.

440
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:59,679
The Dragon has swallowed
many before us.

441
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:02,449
Now put that back.

442
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:05,617
Put what back?

443
00:45:18,597 --> 00:45:20,701
Jax! Hey, Jax.

444
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:26,739
Oh, God.

445
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:29,541
It has been
my charge to gather

446
00:45:29,574 --> 00:45:31,477
all the champions of Earth.

447
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,114
By the time I found Jax,
I was too late.

448
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:37,784
Well, is he gonna live?

449
00:45:37,817 --> 00:45:39,686
The ice...

450
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:42,188
It cauterized his wounds.

451
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:44,490
We've sourced every realm

452
00:45:44,523 --> 00:45:45,592
to find a way to heal him.

453
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:49,028
- What can I do?
- Be patient.

454
00:45:55,134 --> 00:45:57,204
Give them time
to do their work.

455
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,112
We must go.
He awaits.

456
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,690
The great protector,
Lord Raiden.

457
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:28,268
My lord, I've gathered the
remaining champions of Earth.

458
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:37,310
This is what
I have to work with?

459
00:46:40,646 --> 00:46:43,283
You are in no physical
or mental shape to fight.

460
00:46:45,117 --> 00:46:46,519
You don't even have a marking.

461
00:46:50,456 --> 00:46:52,258
All right, hang on.

462
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:54,294
What about me, Gandalf,
where's my fortune cookie jar...

463
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,298
Powerless, arrogant.

464
00:47:00,465 --> 00:47:02,268
The time has long passed.

465
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,804
Our enemies have claimed
nine straight victories.

466
00:47:04,836 --> 00:47:10,242
One more victory and Outworld will
gain control over Earth forever,

467
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:13,712
and Shang Tsung will enslave
the entire human race.

468
00:47:15,914 --> 00:47:17,150
Sorry, what did I miss?

469
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,522
They tried
to kill my family.

470
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:24,658
Help us.

471
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,360
There's nothing for you here,

472
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:29,828
only death.

473
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:31,498
Well, I'm willing to die
for my family.

474
00:47:34,467 --> 00:47:36,369
Let's see if you have
what it takes.

475
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:58,918
The time has come
to end this.

476
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:04,724
Take whatever trophies
you desire...

477
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:09,828
- but their souls are mine.
- Silence!

478
00:49:13,898 --> 00:49:16,668
I've come to claim your world.

479
00:49:16,702 --> 00:49:18,705
You're too late, Raiden.

480
00:49:18,737 --> 00:49:22,307
It is forbidden to claim victory
until the tournament begins.

481
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,676
You are correct, Thunder God.

482
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:27,847
The conflict outside of Mortal
Kombat is not forbidden.

483
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,517
- -Besides the other
guards are too lazy to stop me.

484
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,354
I have come for your souls.

485
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:36,890
You will leave this place
at once, sorcerer.

486
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:42,394
These are your champions?

487
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,334
Kill them.

488
00:50:00,913 --> 00:50:03,449
You think these tricks
will protect you forever?

489
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,885
Only a matter of time.

490
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:41,586
This totally make up
my superpowers.

491
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:43,588
Think I get it now.
It's kind of like a box of chocolates.

492
00:50:43,621 --> 00:50:45,757
You never know what you're gonna get.
Is it gonna be fireballs?

493
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:48,594
Is it gonna be
lightning, huh?

494
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:50,896
Could be shit. Could be, uh...
Could be a frisbee hat.

495
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:52,498
No offense, whoever you are.

496
00:50:53,431 --> 00:50:57,402
The name is Kung Lao.

497
00:50:57,436 --> 00:50:59,672
Descendant of
the Great Kung Lao.

498
00:50:59,704 --> 00:51:02,342
The grand champion
of the Order of Light.

499
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:04,376
Never heard of him.

500
00:51:05,077 --> 00:51:06,546
Listen carefully.

501
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:08,615
Your training has begun.
Come.

502
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:13,086
Your inner power
comes from your arcana,

503
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,621
a gift from the marking
of the Dragon.

504
00:51:15,653 --> 00:51:18,757
The point of your training is
for you to unlock that power.

505
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:22,862
Without it, defeating Outworld
will be impossible.

506
00:51:22,894 --> 00:51:26,965
Kung Lao and I have discovered
our arcana.

507
00:51:26,998 --> 00:51:29,568
In the fight pit,
you'll discover yours.

508
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:36,541
You may enter.

509
00:51:36,574 --> 00:51:37,843
Let's do the damn thing.

510
00:51:37,876 --> 00:51:40,045
I want your fireballs.

511
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,682
- There is no guarantee...
- So, Liu, instead of fireballs,

512
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:44,483
what else is gonna shoot out of my hands?
Like, knives or guns...

513
00:51:44,516 --> 00:51:46,852
Hey, do you
ever shut up?

514
00:51:46,885 --> 00:51:48,920
You're welcome to
stay with us, Miss Blade.

515
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:51,657
But the training area
is for the chosen ones only.

516
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,458
Fucking whoops.

517
00:51:53,492 --> 00:51:54,694
Well, hang on.

518
00:51:54,726 --> 00:51:55,795
We wouldn't be here
without her.

519
00:51:55,827 --> 00:51:57,764
She's one of us.

520
00:51:57,797 --> 00:51:59,965
A fighter without a marking
can never achieve their arcana.

521
00:51:59,998 --> 00:52:03,902
And a fighter without an arcana
is a liability to the others.

522
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,905
Yeah, liability.

523
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:09,843
All right. Bye, bye, blondie.

524
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,179
All right, guys.
Little less of this.

525
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:14,713
Little more of this.
Come on.

526
00:52:14,746 --> 00:52:16,014
Be still and listen.

527
00:52:16,047 --> 00:52:16,982
Fuckin' hell.

528
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:35,701
Jax.

529
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:37,068
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

530
00:52:37,101 --> 00:52:37,971
I'm here.

531
00:52:39,038 --> 00:52:39,938
Hi, buddy.

532
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,047
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

533
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:48,947
You just lay down.

534
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:54,721
What happened?

535
00:53:01,527 --> 00:53:03,762
All you can do now
is test your might.

536
00:53:03,795 --> 00:53:05,197
We have no time to lose.

537
00:53:05,231 --> 00:53:07,100
You must unlock your arcana.

538
00:53:56,849 --> 00:53:59,952
In Mortal Kombat,
talent will only get you so far.

539
00:54:03,222 --> 00:54:05,591
No, that was great. Really.

540
00:54:05,623 --> 00:54:07,626
Good stuff.

541
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:10,829
You know, maybe your arcana is
getting your ass kicked by a hat.

542
00:54:25,077 --> 00:54:25,945
Fight!

543
00:54:27,278 --> 00:54:28,748
No Harry Potter shit,
all right?

544
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:34,988
Cute.

545
00:54:35,688 --> 00:54:37,023
Real cute.

546
00:54:37,056 --> 00:54:38,824
Let's see.
Throwing down again?

547
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:43,095
Is that the only move
you know, mate?

548
00:54:43,128 --> 00:54:44,297
Fuck.

549
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:53,105
Yeah, yeah.
Put a fucking shirt on, Magic Mike.

550
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:55,840
It seems as though we have
our work cut out for us.

551
00:54:55,873 --> 00:54:56,909
I was just warming up.

552
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,045
Let me see your wound.

553
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:04,583
Liu...

554
00:55:05,918 --> 00:55:07,653
How do I find my arcana?

555
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:10,757
It must come
from your soul.

556
00:55:11,824 --> 00:55:13,992
Whatever it is that drives you.

557
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:17,096
So how did you find
your arcana?

558
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,735
Unlike Kung Lao,
I was just a worthless stray.

559
00:55:24,268 --> 00:55:26,805
For reasons beyond my ken,

560
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:31,043
Master Bo' Rai Cho found me
half dead in the gutter

561
00:55:31,076 --> 00:55:36,182
and brought me to the Wu Shi Academy.

562
00:55:36,215 --> 00:55:39,085
There, I was given a purpose.

563
00:55:39,818 --> 00:55:40,853
A brother...

564
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,322
Kung Lao.

565
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:45,658
And I met Lord Raiden.

566
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,994
Kung Lao and I
have served together.

567
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:53,798
Upon graduation,
I was given a name of a man.

568
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:56,702
He was a purveyor
of rare things.

569
00:55:59,038 --> 00:56:00,005
Children.

570
00:56:02,807 --> 00:56:05,344
Orphans like me.

571
00:56:06,945 --> 00:56:08,748
He had a marking,

572
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,349
so I chose to
take it from him.

573
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,120
And in that moment,
my arcana came forth.

574
00:56:38,976 --> 00:56:40,646
Come on, Major.
I've seen better than that.

575
00:56:41,413 --> 00:56:44,416
Again. Again. Again!

576
00:56:44,449 --> 00:56:46,284
Come on, you got this.

577
00:56:48,786 --> 00:56:49,755
These don't work.

578
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:53,992
These are not me.

579
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,835
I'm useless.

580
00:57:05,269 --> 00:57:06,304
Why even bring me here?

581
00:57:08,974 --> 00:57:09,909
I can't help.

582
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:17,849
My first day of training...

583
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:19,951
We had to run 20 miles.

584
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,289
Thought I was gonna die.

585
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:25,057
I wanted to quit,

586
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:28,094
but all I ever wanted
was to be accepted by you...

587
00:57:28,126 --> 00:57:29,929
as an elite fighter.

588
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:31,063
You remember what you told me?

589
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:33,766
How do we keep going?

590
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:36,268
And you proved to yourself
that you can do this or...

591
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,804
regret it for the rest
of your life.

592
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,875
Are you trying to tell me
something, soldier?

593
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,877
Get off your fucking ass,
Major.

594
00:57:52,951 --> 00:57:54,987
Miss Sonya, sit, please.

595
00:57:57,054 --> 00:57:58,390
- Ah, thank you.
- Eat.

596
00:58:00,092 --> 00:58:01,927
Cole, how's your arm?

597
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,862
It's healing up.

598
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:05,097
Eat more, heal fast.

599
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,932
More training tomorrow.

600
00:58:06,965 --> 00:58:08,768
You're fucking
kidding me, aren't you?

601
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,802
Fucking hell.

602
00:58:10,835 --> 00:58:12,303
Is he on our side?

603
00:58:12,336 --> 00:58:14,005
Those are great, mate.

604
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:15,374
They make those
in men's sizes?

605
00:58:18,409 --> 00:58:20,278
Top knot, at the end.

606
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:21,846
What's his name?
Kung Pao.

607
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,815
Pass us some fucking egg roll,
would you?

608
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:27,952
Your ear is painted on, mate?
Egg roll.

609
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:29,221
There you go.
Good boy.

610
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:37,128
Maybe you should lay off
the egg rolls,

611
00:58:37,161 --> 00:58:38,530
seeing how you wouldn't be
ready to fight

612
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:40,199
if you had 100 days to train.

613
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:43,268
I'll dumb it down
for you.

614
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:45,471
Fat, lazy pig.

615
00:58:45,503 --> 00:58:47,038
What did you say?

616
00:58:47,072 --> 00:58:48,007
Terrible fighter.

617
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:52,411
Zero skill.

618
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:54,313
You got a death wish, mate?

619
00:58:54,346 --> 00:58:56,548
Combat takes intelligence.

620
00:58:58,115 --> 00:58:59,018
But you...

621
00:59:00,184 --> 00:59:02,153
You're like a dog.

622
00:59:02,186 --> 00:59:04,422
A dog who fails
his training classes.

623
00:59:04,456 --> 00:59:07,492
Well, how about I take that stupid
fucking sombrero you're wearing,

624
00:59:07,525 --> 00:59:10,061
shove it so far up your ass,
you start speaking Spanish.

625
00:59:10,094 --> 00:59:11,096
How does that sound?

626
00:59:12,597 --> 00:59:13,565
You can try.

627
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,067
I just fucking might.

628
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:17,303
Let me ask you this.

629
00:59:17,335 --> 00:59:19,003
Why would you
jeopardize the goodwill

630
00:59:19,036 --> 00:59:21,973
of the only chance
of your survival?

631
00:59:22,007 --> 00:59:24,443
Princess, why don't you try
being one of them silent monks?

632
00:59:24,476 --> 00:59:26,144
No, no, you misunderstand.

633
00:59:26,177 --> 00:59:27,478
He is here to save you

634
00:59:27,512 --> 00:59:29,448
because you cannot
save yourself.

635
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:32,218
- Oh, fuck, here we go.
- You're like...

636
00:59:32,251 --> 00:59:34,453
an aggressive little bunny.

637
00:59:34,485 --> 00:59:36,855
Soft and useless.

638
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:39,191
Angry mentally, physically.

639
00:59:39,224 --> 00:59:41,026
You should be on your knees
before this man.

640
00:59:43,996 --> 00:59:45,164
I've a better idea.

641
00:59:45,197 --> 00:59:46,899
How about you two
get on your knees

642
00:59:46,931 --> 00:59:48,433
and take turns
sucking my sack?

643
00:59:50,635 --> 00:59:53,639
Do you have any fucking
idea who you're talking to?

644
00:59:53,672 --> 00:59:55,974
I'm wanted in over
35 countries for shit,

645
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:58,243
you fucking ballerinas
couldn't even imagine.

646
00:59:58,277 --> 01:00:00,045
You're angry.

647
01:00:00,077 --> 01:00:02,114
Oh! Fucking nothing
gets by you, does it?

648
01:00:04,215 --> 01:00:05,317
Good.

649
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:07,385
You should be.

650
01:00:07,418 --> 01:00:08,386
You failure.

651
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:11,923
Failure?

652
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:15,628
Fucking failure?

653
01:00:15,661 --> 01:00:18,429
Let me educate you,
motherfucker. I'm Kano.

654
01:00:18,463 --> 01:00:20,599
I'm the black fucking dragon.

655
01:00:20,632 --> 01:00:22,268
And who are you two, huh?

656
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,135
You're some fucking
cave-dwelling hippy,

657
01:00:24,168 --> 01:00:25,436
twirling his anal beads,

658
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:28,106
taking orders
from this Wu Shu wanker,

659
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:30,241
who wears
a hubcap as a helmet.

660
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:31,610
Now, sit down!

661
01:00:31,643 --> 01:00:35,181
Shut up and pass me
a fucking egg roll.

662
01:00:49,728 --> 01:00:51,597
That was it, wasn't it?

663
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:54,967
You all saw that?

664
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,001
Laser beam!

665
01:00:57,034 --> 01:00:59,437
It's better than fireballs,
you pussy.

666
01:01:02,273 --> 01:01:04,042
Come on, Kano.

667
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:05,610
I knew I'd get mine first.

668
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:16,521
We are running
out of time, Cole.

669
01:01:16,554 --> 01:01:18,657
Focus on what you can't deny.

670
01:01:19,657 --> 01:01:21,159
Find the truth in you.

671
01:01:22,693 --> 01:01:24,396
The pain.

672
01:01:24,429 --> 01:01:25,631
It's the ultimate catalyst.

673
01:01:30,335 --> 01:01:32,070
- Again.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa... Hold on.

674
01:01:32,103 --> 01:01:33,404
Does it have to be him? I...

675
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:42,614
You know, I see a little bit
of arcana there.

676
01:01:42,646 --> 01:01:44,016
Give me one more crack at it.

677
01:01:44,048 --> 01:01:46,184
Focus on the pain, Cole.

678
01:01:46,217 --> 01:01:48,286
- I'm focusing, nothing's happening. It hurts...
- Stick with it.

679
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,322
Again.

680
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,226
Yeah, you're right.
Nothing's happening.

681
01:01:55,393 --> 01:01:56,527
You're as lazy, ya?

682
01:02:11,409 --> 01:02:12,377
What are you looking at?

683
01:02:16,648 --> 01:02:17,750
They're beautiful.

684
01:02:17,782 --> 01:02:18,717
You're a lucky man.

685
01:02:20,652 --> 01:02:21,586
Thanks.

686
01:02:23,655 --> 01:02:26,458
You have failed
to find your arcana.

687
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,427
Without it, you are a liability
to the others.

688
01:02:30,728 --> 01:02:33,064
So where did this come from?

689
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:36,034
And why am I the only champion that
had the marking since I was born?

690
01:02:36,068 --> 01:02:39,371
Your marking comes
from your lineage, Cole.

691
01:02:39,403 --> 01:02:41,039
Lineage?

692
01:02:41,072 --> 01:02:43,275
I'm an orphan
from the south side of Chicago.

693
01:02:43,307 --> 01:02:47,313
You're a descendant of one of the
greatest ninjas to ever walk the Earth.

694
01:02:48,646 --> 01:02:50,115
Hanzo Hasashi.

695
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:56,422
He was murdered along
with his wife and eldest son

696
01:02:56,454 --> 01:02:58,556
by the same assassin
that hunts you now.

697
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:00,126
Sub-Zero.

698
01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:06,632
<i>The moment he died,
Hanzo descended into the Netherrealm,</i>

699
01:03:06,664 --> 01:03:08,433
<i>the furthest reaches of hell,</i>

700
01:03:08,467 --> 01:03:10,769
<i>endlessly searching
for revenge.</i>

701
01:03:10,802 --> 01:03:13,771
<i>But his bloodline lived on.</i>

702
01:03:13,804 --> 01:03:17,076
<i>I rescued Hanzo's
only surviving child...</i>

703
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:19,177
<i>and hid her in the one place</i>

704
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,645
<i>he wouldn't think to find her.</i>

705
01:03:23,514 --> 01:03:25,550
For centuries,
the Hasashi marking

706
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:28,419
has passed down
through your ancestors.

707
01:03:28,452 --> 01:03:31,824
I had a hope the power in your
bloodline was still strong in you.

708
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:35,260
Now I know that's not the case.

709
01:03:42,467 --> 01:03:44,637
Go, be with your family.

710
01:03:45,871 --> 01:03:48,340
Cole, do not give up on this.

711
01:03:49,907 --> 01:03:51,076
I'm sorry.

712
01:04:26,411 --> 01:04:27,646
Welcome.

713
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,554
The great hunter, Nitara.

714
01:04:35,586 --> 01:04:39,358
She is beautiful, isn't she?

715
01:04:39,391 --> 01:04:41,726
Yeah. That screech
is a real turn on.

716
01:04:46,965 --> 01:04:52,905
My loyal warriors, Kabal,
General Reiko,

717
01:04:52,938 --> 01:04:56,708
I have seen the so-called
champions of Earth realm,

718
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:00,211
and they're no match
for all of you.

719
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:02,313
We are on
the precipice of victory

720
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:04,816
and taking Earth realm forever.

721
01:05:04,849 --> 01:05:07,352
But we must strike now.

722
01:05:07,385 --> 01:05:10,522
Raiden has prevented entry
into his temple.

723
01:05:10,554 --> 01:05:12,857
I must find a way
to bring his shield down

724
01:05:12,891 --> 01:05:15,760
in order to obliterate
our opposition.

725
01:05:15,793 --> 01:05:17,195
I think I can help.

726
01:05:17,228 --> 01:05:18,763
Did you see a guy down there?

727
01:05:18,797 --> 01:05:20,831
A complete fucking asshole.

728
01:05:20,864 --> 01:05:22,633
Answers to Kano.

729
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:24,302
- Kano.
- Yeah.

730
01:05:24,335 --> 01:05:26,571
He's the reason I live
in an iron lung.

731
01:05:26,605 --> 01:05:29,608
He's a low life,
piece of shit scumbag.

732
01:05:29,641 --> 01:05:31,210
You're going to love him.

733
01:05:36,981 --> 01:05:38,884
Prince Goro.

734
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:42,453
It is an honor to have
Shokan blood on our side.

735
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:45,657
Now we shall end this prophecy
once and for all.

736
01:06:08,313 --> 01:06:09,748
Well, well, well.

737
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,518
You backstabbing, two-faced
ugly motherfucker.

738
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:18,256
- Kabal.
- Hey, Kano.

739
01:06:18,289 --> 01:06:19,724
It's been a while.

740
01:06:19,757 --> 01:06:21,292
You getting enough sleep, mate?

741
01:06:21,326 --> 01:06:23,829
Your eyes are a little
redder than usual.

742
01:06:23,862 --> 01:06:25,864
You've got a big mouth
for someone who's standing

743
01:06:25,896 --> 01:06:28,766
on the wrong side of
the electric fence, tough guy.

744
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,435
You working
for the other fella?

745
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:32,803
- That wizard?
- Working with him, not for him.

746
01:06:32,836 --> 01:06:35,373
And trust me, it has its perks.

747
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:36,541
Like what?

748
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:38,443
This is fucking tragic.

749
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:39,711
Look at yourself.

750
01:06:39,744 --> 01:06:41,780
You used to be someone to fear.

751
01:06:41,813 --> 01:06:44,950
You've fallen down a long way
since you led the Black Dragon.

752
01:06:44,983 --> 01:06:46,451
Don't tell me about
the Black Dragon.

753
01:06:46,483 --> 01:06:47,885
I am the Black Dragon.

754
01:06:47,918 --> 01:06:50,655
Which one's your boss?
Let me guess. The blonde?

755
01:06:50,688 --> 01:06:52,824
That mask cutting off your
air supply, you dumb prick?

756
01:06:52,856 --> 01:06:55,360
I don't take orders
from anyone, Kabal.

757
01:06:55,393 --> 01:06:56,795
Then you're on the wrong side.

758
01:06:56,827 --> 01:06:59,331
Fight with us and you could
have more money

759
01:06:59,364 --> 01:07:00,932
than you know what to do with.

760
01:07:00,965 --> 01:07:03,501
Hell, you could turn this
old temple into your own casino

761
01:07:03,534 --> 01:07:05,469
if you wanted to.

762
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:07,873
Just name your price,
then double it and double it again.

763
01:07:07,905 --> 01:07:10,474
What are you
waiting for, asshole?

764
01:07:10,507 --> 01:07:12,577
So what would
I need to do?

765
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:31,764
Just wait here.

766
01:08:15,672 --> 01:08:16,774
What is that?

767
01:08:24,849 --> 01:08:27,418
You know, the problem
with these new lightning sticks,

768
01:08:30,954 --> 01:08:32,957
they just don't make them
like they used to.

769
01:08:38,128 --> 01:08:40,431
What? You didn't think you'd
actually change me, did you?

770
01:08:41,932 --> 01:08:44,636
The undoing of the prophecy
has begun.

771
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:00,918
Back inside.

772
01:09:02,619 --> 01:09:03,988
Dad!

773
01:09:04,021 --> 01:09:05,157
Get back inside!

774
01:09:07,591 --> 01:09:08,594
Cole!

775
01:09:12,095 --> 01:09:13,398
Hey!

776
01:09:14,631 --> 01:09:16,000
I'm the one you want.

777
01:09:16,033 --> 01:09:17,001
You see that!

778
01:09:18,036 --> 01:09:19,104
Okay.

779
01:09:33,952 --> 01:09:35,119
Finish them!

780
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:02,514
Damn! Your breath stinks.

781
01:11:10,782 --> 01:11:13,752
This is not the blood
of the Chosen One.

782
01:11:15,787 --> 01:11:19,091
Your death has no worth.

783
01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:24,095
Ah, girls can be mean!

784
01:11:24,127 --> 01:11:25,630
Don't worry, darling!

785
01:11:25,662 --> 01:11:27,865
You're still good enough
for me.

786
01:11:47,251 --> 01:11:48,921
Want me to slow down a little?

787
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:58,330
You're beneath me.

788
01:12:00,832 --> 01:12:03,001
Now, destroy him, my beauty.

789
01:12:56,953 --> 01:12:58,724
Flawless victory.

790
01:13:14,971 --> 01:13:17,307
- No!
- No!

791
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:21,680
Now I tear out your spine,
champion!

792
01:13:21,712 --> 01:13:22,780
Fuck this.

793
01:13:32,989 --> 01:13:34,291
Mom!

794
01:13:40,264 --> 01:13:41,332
Get in the car.

795
01:13:41,364 --> 01:13:42,768
Get in the car!

796
01:13:47,337 --> 01:13:49,840
Come on! Come on! Come on!

797
01:13:53,176 --> 01:13:54,211
No, no.

798
01:13:57,381 --> 01:13:58,784
Mom!

799
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:01,453
Get closer!

800
01:14:04,221 --> 01:14:05,823
No, Mom!

801
01:14:11,162 --> 01:14:12,197
Aah!

802
01:14:14,765 --> 01:14:16,033
Cole!

803
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:16,967
Allison!

804
01:14:31,282 --> 01:14:32,317
Aah!

805
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:40,257
Get off me!

806
01:15:05,949 --> 01:15:07,519
Daddy, use your uppercut!

807
01:16:28,198 --> 01:16:29,600
You okay?

808
01:16:29,634 --> 01:16:31,502
We're fine. Are you okay?

809
01:16:31,534 --> 01:16:32,537
Yeah.

810
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:35,006
Badass suit, Dad.

811
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:45,050
Blade!

812
01:16:51,288 --> 01:16:53,157
Help!

813
01:17:53,551 --> 01:17:56,521
- What's that?
- It's okay.

814
01:17:56,554 --> 01:17:57,989
It's a doorway back...

815
01:17:59,289 --> 01:18:00,391
It's not over.

816
01:18:07,331 --> 01:18:09,233
Impossible.

817
01:18:09,265 --> 01:18:12,303
Thank you for helping
my fighter find his arcana.

818
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:17,943
After 4000 years, the Hasashi
bloodline still lives on.

819
01:18:19,243 --> 01:18:20,211
Bi-Han.

820
01:18:27,618 --> 01:18:29,153
Stop him!

821
01:18:39,563 --> 01:18:41,699
Your soul's mine.

822
01:18:45,101 --> 01:18:47,104
He's about
to get his soul sucked.

823
01:18:47,137 --> 01:18:49,340
I love the scream
right before...

824
01:18:54,177 --> 01:18:55,279
Gotcha.

825
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:11,329
Shang Tsung!

826
01:19:17,801 --> 01:19:19,203
No!

827
01:19:25,842 --> 01:19:27,744
Where are we?

828
01:19:27,778 --> 01:19:29,814
We are in the void.

829
01:19:29,846 --> 01:19:33,150
It is the realm
between your world and mine.

830
01:19:33,184 --> 01:19:35,086
Shang Tsung
cannot follow us here.

831
01:19:50,167 --> 01:19:51,302
If we're to die...

832
01:19:52,603 --> 01:19:54,605
it was supposed
to be together.

833
01:19:56,539 --> 01:19:58,643
I'm sorry, Liu Kang.

834
01:20:02,145 --> 01:20:03,414
Without Kung Lao,

835
01:20:05,882 --> 01:20:07,318
Earthrealm is lost.

836
01:20:09,153 --> 01:20:10,655
Lord Raiden.

837
01:20:10,688 --> 01:20:12,457
Why couldn't you save him?

838
01:20:12,489 --> 01:20:14,157
All the Gods are forbidden

839
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:17,528
from engaging in one realm's
war against another.

840
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,529
It is my job
to protect Earthrealm

841
01:20:19,563 --> 01:20:22,167
but I cannot save
every soul within it.

842
01:20:23,466 --> 01:20:25,168
No.

843
01:20:25,202 --> 01:20:28,239
It's not over,
we still need to fight.

844
01:20:32,676 --> 01:20:34,712
Cole.

845
01:20:34,744 --> 01:20:37,481
The blood on this blade
is your ancestors.

846
01:20:38,215 --> 01:20:39,784
Hanzo Hasashi's.

847
01:20:39,817 --> 01:20:42,819
I took it from him
the day he died.

848
01:20:42,853 --> 01:20:46,323
Use it and the spirit of Hanzo
fights with you.

849
01:20:50,728 --> 01:20:51,796
So what's the plan?

850
01:20:53,564 --> 01:20:55,365
We need to fight smarter.

851
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:56,634
We need to control the fight.

852
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:58,836
How?

853
01:20:58,868 --> 01:21:00,403
I mean, they're better trained
and better prepared.

854
01:21:00,436 --> 01:21:02,140
Plus they don't mind
breaking the rules.

855
01:21:04,807 --> 01:21:06,511
We need to split them up.

856
01:21:06,543 --> 01:21:09,247
Lord Raiden,
can you send anyone anywhere?

857
01:21:10,547 --> 01:21:11,849
Well, they don't want
a tournament.

858
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:13,216
Let's give them one.

859
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,385
But let's do it our way.

860
01:21:15,786 --> 01:21:17,288
Give me Reiko.

861
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,523
I got a score to settle.

862
01:21:28,364 --> 01:21:29,466
Hey, big boy!

863
01:21:33,904 --> 01:21:35,473
Sonya...

864
01:21:35,506 --> 01:21:37,175
Please tell me I get
the bitch with the teeth.

865
01:21:37,207 --> 01:21:38,809
You get to take out
your old buddy, Kano.

866
01:21:40,911 --> 01:21:42,512
I know I've seen you
kick his ass before,

867
01:21:42,546 --> 01:21:44,649
but he's got a laser now.
Watch out for that.

868
01:21:44,681 --> 01:21:45,817
Oh, I got an idea.

869
01:21:47,685 --> 01:21:49,387
Honey, I'm home.

870
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,454
You and I will take
Mileena and Kabal.

871
01:21:51,488 --> 01:21:53,457
I know this is
personal for you.

872
01:21:53,489 --> 01:21:54,492
Are you ready?

873
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:04,836
You again.

874
01:22:06,569 --> 01:22:07,837
What about Sub-Zero?

875
01:22:07,871 --> 01:22:09,806
Nobody's taking him
out one on one.

876
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,841
Yeah.

877
01:22:10,873 --> 01:22:12,842
We save Sub-Zero for last.

878
01:22:12,876 --> 01:22:15,480
We take him out together
as a team.

879
01:22:50,546 --> 01:22:51,781
Oh-oh.

880
01:23:21,779 --> 01:23:22,981
Yeah, these motherfuckers work.

881
01:23:31,055 --> 01:23:32,690
Ah! Damn it!

882
01:23:32,722 --> 01:23:34,324
I'd come out if I were you.

883
01:24:05,655 --> 01:24:06,858
Oh!

884
01:24:07,791 --> 01:24:08,893
Fucking bitch!

885
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:14,632
Hey!

886
01:24:22,506 --> 01:24:24,475
And you owe me...

887
01:24:24,507 --> 01:24:26,943
three million dollars.

888
01:24:53,604 --> 01:24:54,872
Fucking hell!

889
01:24:54,904 --> 01:24:57,375
This is a bit harder
than I thought.

890
01:25:00,144 --> 01:25:02,512
Tell me, blondie,
how does that feel?

891
01:25:05,649 --> 01:25:07,385
It was fucking amazing...

892
01:25:07,417 --> 01:25:08,518
- Oh!
- ...mate.

893
01:25:38,849 --> 01:25:41,051
Oh, I'm sorry, did I cut ya?

894
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,032
What the fuck!

895
01:26:26,963 --> 01:26:28,064
For Kung Lao.

896
01:26:38,074 --> 01:26:39,143
Shit!

897
01:26:52,855 --> 01:26:54,157
A little help!

898
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:14,211
That's pretty cool.

899
01:27:14,243 --> 01:27:15,813
Little parting gift from Kano.

900
01:27:18,215 --> 01:27:19,250
Okay.
I'm almost ready.

901
01:27:19,283 --> 01:27:20,818
How about you?

902
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:22,719
Are you sure Dad's gonna be
able to find us?

903
01:27:22,752 --> 01:27:24,521
Completely sure.
Look, I just want to get us out of here.

904
01:27:24,555 --> 01:27:26,224
Fuck another four armed monster
showing up.

905
01:28:00,222 --> 01:28:01,091
Emily!

906
01:28:06,029 --> 01:28:08,666
No! Emily! No!

907
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,576
Allison...

908
01:28:23,846 --> 01:28:27,751
Finally the Hasashi bloodline
will end.

909
01:28:57,314 --> 01:29:00,217
Now you will die
with your family.

910
01:29:25,108 --> 01:29:27,011
The blade of Hanzo.

911
01:29:38,387 --> 01:29:39,890
Get over here.

912
01:33:46,302 --> 01:33:47,637
For the Lin Kuei.

913
01:34:30,613 --> 01:34:31,949
- Dad.
- Okay. I got you.

914
01:36:06,076 --> 01:36:07,211
These are my friends.

915
01:36:09,145 --> 01:36:10,147
I am Liu Kang.

916
01:36:11,346 --> 01:36:13,617
Sit. I will warm you.

917
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:21,625
I'm impressed.

918
01:36:23,592 --> 01:36:25,362
I thought you said
you couldn't get involved.

919
01:36:30,265 --> 01:36:31,534
Shang Tsung.

920
01:36:48,685 --> 01:36:51,621
The prophecy
has been fulfilled.

921
01:36:51,654 --> 01:36:55,525
Has the blood on your hands
taught you nothing?

922
01:36:55,557 --> 01:37:00,096
No matter how many of
my people you put in the ground,

923
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:03,167
there will always be another
to take their place.

924
01:37:05,301 --> 01:37:08,505
Today you have killed
my warriors

925
01:37:08,537 --> 01:37:10,673
and you think you have won.

926
01:37:10,707 --> 01:37:13,777
But death
is only another portal.

927
01:37:22,284 --> 01:37:27,123
Next time I see you,
I will not bring fighters.

928
01:37:28,190 --> 01:37:30,693
I will bring armies.

929
01:37:30,726 --> 01:37:33,529
You will return to Outworld
at once.

930
01:37:34,296 --> 01:37:35,331
Earthrealm...

931
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,240
He talks so much.

932
01:37:47,911 --> 01:37:49,712
What happens next?

933
01:37:49,746 --> 01:37:51,882
Today we are victorious.

934
01:37:51,914 --> 01:37:54,283
But there are other enemies
to fight.

935
01:37:55,752 --> 01:37:57,888
We cannot let our guard down.

936
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:01,858
I'll assemble a new list
of champions.

937
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:04,795
You must find them.

938
01:38:06,429 --> 01:38:07,364
Who's first?

939
01:38:18,841 --> 01:38:22,512
My man,
I was just about to call you.

940
01:38:22,545 --> 01:38:24,881
I need you tomorrow night.

941
01:38:24,913 --> 01:38:28,551
Sorry. My days fighting
for 200 bucks are done.

942
01:38:28,585 --> 01:38:30,654
Oh, you're finally quitting,
huh?

943
01:38:30,686 --> 01:38:33,923
Yeah, uh, something like that.

944
01:38:33,957 --> 01:38:35,492
Where're you gonna go?

945
01:38:35,524 --> 01:38:36,859
Hollywood.

946
01:38:36,893 --> 01:38:40,596
Hollywood? What the hell's
in Hollywood?

947
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:42,332
Not what, who.

948
01:38:43,432 --> 01:38:44,400
It's been fun.

949
01:38:47,369 --> 01:38:48,671
Hollywood.

950
