<i>How do you leave someone?</i>

4
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,259
<i>Really truly leave them.</i>

5
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,263
<i>Leave them so far behind that</i>

00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,721
<i>it's like you never met?</i>

7
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,242
Maybe you should do another one.

8
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,161
Sam.

9
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,544
W-what do you want to do?

10
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,007
I just want to sit here.

11
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,510
Yeah, but...

12
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,767
Look, G, I just want you to know
that I support you

13
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,271
in whatever decision you want to make.

14
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,150
Okay.

15
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,319
G, can you say something?

16
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,197
Sam.

17
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,742
I know you're trying
to be sweet right now

18
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,205
and that you're worried about me.

19
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,000
But just stop.

20
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:10,881
Let's get married, G.

21
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,175
Let's do it. I'm serious.
Let's get married.

22
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,719
What?

23
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,224
I love you.

24
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,146
They're here.

25
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,773
I don't want to make them wait.

26
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,290
I want you to order
a self-drive on the way home.

27
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,836
I don't want anyone driving. Okay?

28
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,173
Sam, you're backing me up
on this, right?

29
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:56,301
Sam?

30
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:58,804
Uh, yes.

31
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,974
Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Olsen,
I got you.

32
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,890
Whose parents are gonna be there?

33
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,520
No one's parents, Dad.
We're in college.

34
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,187
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,689
You look a little green
around the gills.

36
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,609
I'm fine, Mom. I'm just...

37
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,068
Can I have my coat, please, Eli?

38
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,946
Yes, ma'am.

39
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,573
You need a scarf, too.

40
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,199
You're not wearing enough.

41
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:20,949
What is this?

42
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,328
It's mine. And I want it back.

43
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,998
Uh, my purse too, thank you.

44
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,833
Have fun, you two. Be safe.

45
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,462
Yes, sir, we won't be out too long.
Good night, Mrs. Olsen.

46
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,590
Thank you, Eli.

47
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,384
Happy Halloween, sir.

48
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,138
Eli, it's Christmas.

49
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,226
Of course. Merry Christmas, sir.

50
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,328
Ow.

51
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,208
Missed. Alright.

52
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,668
Oh!

Oh, does this have, uh, rum in it?

It does not, sir.

60
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,727
Okay, shots for everyone, Daniel.

61
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,190

a restriction on shots served.

Do you have my phone?
I can't find it.

66
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,740
No, I don't. Did you leave it?

67
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,244
Fuck. Did I ever give it to you?

68
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,993
Uh, I'm, I'm good.

69
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,830
- Let me take that for you, G.
- What?

70
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,664
G, you shouldn't be drinking.

71
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,414
Stop.

72
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,250
Yo, are you two fighting?

73
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,376

75
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,503

You said you wanted
something to do with nature.

133
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,502
Uh, yeah, sure. But, I meant...

134
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,085
I don't know, something like

135
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,129
River or...

136
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:12,217

is a baby girl?

143
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,277
I can tell.

144
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,030

it's a boy.

Shut up.

I'm having girl dreams.

149
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,372
Mm.

150
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,874
Yeah, you also had a dream
you gave birth to a pony.

151
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:44,960
Mm-mm.

152
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,169
- No, I didn't.
- You having a pony too?

153
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,337
- No, I didn't.
- Oh my god. Yes, you did.

154
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:49,963
When?

155
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,548
You told me you were gonna break up
with me when I said

156
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,677
we can ride that pony.

157
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,054
Oh no!

158
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,265
I totally forgot about that.

159
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,516
And we named her something.

160
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,227
G.

161
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:03,979

162
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,898

Come back in, Sam.

165
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,970
I think it's just an animal.

166
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,639
Come on.

167
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,795

168
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:12,712

No.

170
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,345
Bad dreams.

171
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,390
Mm.

172
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,141
You okay?

173
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,936
My back hurts.

174
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,312
My boobs hurt.

175
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,064
My feet hurt.

176
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,359
And she won't... stop kicking.

177
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,027
He.

178
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,240
Come on, babe, we got
to get going, seriously.

179
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,368
Ugh.

180
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:44,913
Oh.

181
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,010
You okay?

182
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,095
Yeah, my feet.

183
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,470
Oh.

184
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,599
Keep telling you...

185
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,101
You need to get the All Stars.

186
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,575
<i>We've got
to clear six miles by sundown.</i>

187
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,410
As long as we stay away from the road,
I think we'll be okay.

188
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,167
You okay?

189
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,295
I’m always afraid
they're gonna shoot us.

190
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,844
Just do what they say. Move slowly.

191
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,029
<i>Stop. Hands up.</i>

192
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,322
<i>Put your packs down
and turn around.</i>

193
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,431
<i>Any weapons?</i>

194
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,976
Uh, yeah, we have a machete
and a revolver.

195
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,643
<i>Where are they?</i>

196
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,730
In the pack.

197
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,985
<i>What's the girl hiding
under her shirt?</i>

198
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,696
I'm nine months pregnant!

199
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,992
<i>Walk backwards towards us.</i>

200
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,286
<i>Slowly.</i>

201
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,040
One at a time.

202
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,291
You, go ahead.

203
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,544
You, stop.

204
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,343
Put your palm up against this fence.

205
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:54,770
Right over here.

206
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,565
Hold that pack low.

207
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,366
Put your palm up on the fence.

208
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,499
No. No, no, no,
you're over there.

209
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,021
Hey, hey, hey.

210
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,079
<i>Where are you guys
coming from?</i>

211
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,998
<i>After the Blitz, we thought
things would just get better.</i>

212
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,334
<i>We waited out for a few months,
and then we tried to get to New York.</i>

213
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:05,881
<i>And then on our way to New York,
they detonated the electronic pulse thing.</i>

214
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,050
<i>The EMP.</i>

215
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,804
<i>Yeah. Grunt freaked out
and triggered it during an attack.</i>

216
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,930
<i>Once the EMP blast radius went down,</i>

217
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,351
<i>the next wave of androids swarmed
the soldiers and...</i>

218
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,563
<i>Well, that was the end
of New York City.</i>

219
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,606
<i>We ended up looping
back up the long way.</i>

220
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:23,857
<i>And now we're</i>

221
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,317
<i>trying to get to Boston.</i>

222
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,071
<i>Boston is fortified, but you
can't get straight there.</i> GEORGIA: Sorry.

223
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,574
<i>The area surrounding it
is No Man's Land.</i>

224
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,036
<i>Gonna be tough unless you can figure out
a way to come in from the sea.</i>

225
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,372
<i>I wouldn't risk it
while you're this far along.</i>

226
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,372
<i>Oh, um,</i>

227
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,749
<i>I actu... I can ask you.</i>

228
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:44,419
<i>Uh, when I give birth, I know
that I have to cut the umbilical cord.</i>

229
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,714
<i>I-I read it that I have to.</i>

230
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,465
How do I get it out of me?
Is it just gonna fall out or...

231
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,010
You can have the baby here.

232
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,640
What?

233
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,392
I can?

234
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,522
I mean, you're past due.
You really shouldn't be traveling at all.

235
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,318
Sam wants us to get to Boston
before I give birth.

236
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,070
We're trying to get to this.

237
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,489
Look.

238
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,824
Families with a child,
one year or younger,

239
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:15,869
they qualify to

240
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:17,994
take a boat somewhere safe.

241
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:18,914
Maybe Asia.

242
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,707
Have you heard anything about it?

243
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:25,210
Yeah. Um, couple of months ago,
this is what everyone was doing.

244
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,255
When did you get this?

245
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,342
In the spring. Why?
Did you hear something?

246
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,094
No.

247
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,053
I can ask around for you,

248
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,016
but... I heard they were only taking
the mothers and babies.

249
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,560
No fathers.

250
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,564
It's a food supply thing.

251
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,320
You want to hear the heartbeat?

252
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:54,992
Ye-yeah.

253
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,000
Yo, what's up, man?
Can I get one of those?

254
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:47,961
Nope.

255
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,886
You, uh, you know if they got
any shipments going to Boston?

256
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,013
Anyone I can hitch a ride with?

257
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,141
My girl's pregnant, and we trying to cut
through the No Man's Land.

258
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,310
No one's getting through No Man's Land.

259
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,229
That's why it's called No Man's Land.

260
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,066
Yeah. I just mean maybe there's a way
for us to get to Boston.

261
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,276
Boston is surrounded as fuck.

262
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,319
They got a strong holdout
because of the troops

263
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,364
and the EMPs.

264
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,616
But all it takes is one domino.

265
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,660
What you mean domino?

266
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,913
You got a EMP, right?

267
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,539
You can only detonate it once.

268
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,916
Takes out everything
with an electrical current

269
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,253
within its blast radius.

270
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,129
Then all we got is guns.

271
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,632
Gun only do so much.

272
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,093
But that's what androids want.

273
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,844
Get us to blow an EMP

274
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:42,099
so they can get up nice... and close.

275
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,564
You, uh... you know if they
still shipping people out?

276
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,817
Like civilians off the coast?

277
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,571
You trying to hop over to China?

278
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,907
Maybe Korea.

279
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,661
Heard it's safer over there.

280
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,581
Maybe just a rumor.

281
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,374
Yeah.

282
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,585
I bet they still have boats.

283
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:11,753
Hard to say.

284
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:15,966
I'm not trying to run from this.

285
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,137
I got a family, man.

286
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:22,973
Who doesn't?

287
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:45,535
Please, I told you I had
a hip replacement. Just listen to me!

288
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,786
I don't know about
no hip replacement.

289
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,663
All I know is you keep
lighting up my detector.

290
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,290
- Now step back!
- Please, please!

291
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,083
You want to cut me open?
You wanna see?

292
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,126
I bleed red just like you.

293
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,754
Hey, you got metal
in your bones.

294
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,672
- You got five seconds to back off!
- Please.

295
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,758
Five!
Get off the fence! Three!

296
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,259
No, please.
They said they would...

297
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,561
<i>The doctor said
she hadn't heard anything</i>

298
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,315
about the family initiative for weeks.

299
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,023
I just talked to a soldier.

300
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,194
He said they still got boats
going out of Boston.

301
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,863
Why would they still have boats
if they're not taking families?

302
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,783
I think we should stay.

303
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:24,660
We have

304
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,703
shelter.

305
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,372
We got a doctor.

306
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,499
And what happens after?

307
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,875
We got days of walking left,

308
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,547
and we gotta get through No Man's Land
without being noticed.

309
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,967
It's not gonna be easy
with a baby boy with us.

310
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,683
If you can find
a safe way for us to go,

311
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,061
the soldiers can give us
a ride or something,

312
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:55,065
I'll go.

313
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,323
Fuck. I wish we still had the internet.

314
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:04,867
Sushi.

315
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,286
Ah. Freezers.

316
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:12,873
Consistent pair of clean socks.

317
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:16,879
Oh.

318
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,016
What if they only take one of us?

319
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,107
Where's this coming from?

320
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,693
She said something about

321
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,198
only taking the mothers
and the babies.

322
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,746
She said they might not take you.

323
00:22:56,668 --> 00:23:00,587
I mean, I... I guess, I guess you
and the baby get on the boat,

324
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:01,465
and I'll...

325
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,260
I'll... I-I don't know. I...

326
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,847
I'll just figure something else out, G.

327
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,476
Fuck you.

328
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:14,353
Wait, what?

329
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,313
That's not what I want to hear.

330
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,235
Okay, Georgia.

331
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:24,905
What do you want to hear?

332
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,034
I want to hear that
we're in this together.

333
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:32,077
Th-that's what I thought
that we were doing.

334
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:32,953
- That...
- It is what we're doing.

335
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,579
That we could have just
gotten rid of this,

336
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,582
but we didn't.

337
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,874
And this baby's on its way, Sam.

338
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,835
And you're trying to put me
on a boat by myself

339
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,339
- so I'm not your responsibility anymore.
- I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that!

340
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:45,175
You asked me what I thought.

341
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,885
You're throwing a bunch of what-ifs at me
and I'm just trying to do the right thing.

342
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:52,683
What part of putting me
on a boat by myself

343
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,392
is the right thing?

344
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,104
Okay, baby, can you chill?

345
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,983
You're being very hormonal right now.

346
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,318
No, baby...

347
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:07,195
I am allowed to have emotions!

348
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,032
This is not me being hormonal!

349
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,039
I should have just broken up with you.

350
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,334
Why would you say that?

351
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:23,130
Forget it.

352
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,564
Where are you going?

353
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,815
I'm gonna go get us a ride.

354
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,693
Don't worry, I'm not abandoning you
or whatever.

355
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:02,794
Game over!

356
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,255
Game over!

357
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,964
- What time is it?
- Game over.

358
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,259
What time is it?

359
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:18,892
That's what I'm talking about!

360
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,896
We got a special treat for tonight.

361
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,104
This is no android right here.

362
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,524
I know it looks too good to be true.

363
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:29,404
This is one hundred percent
USDA prime beef right here.

364
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,991
Yo, man, how can I get
a ride to Boston?

365
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:36,535
Oh man.

366
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:40,080
You could fight me for it.

367
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:42,000
- Ooh!
- Oh, it's on now.

368
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:47,130
Or are you gonna run?

369
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:53,887
Oh, he's mad.

370
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,220
Hey!

371
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,054
Where are you going?

372
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,141
Convoy's going up
to Nashua tomorrow.

373
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:01,228
It'd get you just about as close
as anyone can get.

374
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:03,395
Yeah.

375
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:04,938
All you gotta do is...

376
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,191
All you gotta do is

377
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,695
put me flat on my back

378
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:11,820
and you got yourself a ride.

379
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,196
Ooh!

380
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,494
What's it gonna be, little man?

381
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,543
Ladies! Ladies!

382
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:27,878
Hey, ladies!

383
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,837
Whoa!

384
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,672
Yeah.

385
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,090
House rules.

386
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,177
No holds barred.

387
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,220
And you rock till you drop.

388
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:40,849
There you go!

389
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:44,646
Don't run off now.

390
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,146
<i>Miss.</i>

391
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:49,401
Miss.

392
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,445
Can you come out here please?

393
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:56,825
Miss.

394
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,161
Sam?

395
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,374
Where's Sam?

396
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,092
Sir.

397
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,928
Oh yeah.

398
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:18,514
Sam.

399
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,889
What the fuck
did you do to him?

400
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:23,099
He was fighting with one
of my patrol officers last night.

401
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:23,725
What?

402
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,603
Now I got a man with a busted skull
who's going to be blind in one eye.

403
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:29,024
No. No. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, but that,

404
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,441
that can't be what happened.

405
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,318
You know, I can account
for a certain amount of rowdiness

406
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,446
among the soldiers.

407
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,449
But I will not tolerate
a guest on my base

408
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,493
wailing on my boys.

409
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,663
What are you, what are you going
to do to him?

410
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,247
Lady, I'm fighting
a fucking war here

411
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,415
against an enemy
that literally never sleeps,

412
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,170
whose main objective is to wipe us
off the face of the Earth.

413
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:54,714
We've got half a platoon,
most of them barely trained.

414
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,968
And I do not need a couple of kids
too chickenshit to enlist

415
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,388
putting any of them
out of commission.

416
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,765
You're no longer welcome
on this base.

417
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,352
Sir, I'm,

418
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:07,853
I'm, I'm pregnant.

419
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,354
Congratulations.

420
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,648
Sir, I, I don't think you understand.

421
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,861
I have permission from Dr. Howe...

422
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,613
Yes, I've spoken to Dr. Howe.

423
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,032
I've rescinded her request.

424
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:23,869
Sir...

425
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:26,039
You got two minutes
to get off my fucking base.

426
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:28,623
Please.

427
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,625
Now you got one minute

428
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,378
before I signal the other outposts
and tell them not to let you in.

429
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,423
Come on, G, let's go.

430
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,468
- Come on, man!
- Let's go.

431
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,386
- Come on!
- Keep moving.

432
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,054
- Hey.
- Hey.

433
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,893
Some painkillers.
Some hydrogen peroxide.

434
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:47,684
And medical gloves for him.

435
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:48,977
- Get back!
- I need my mache...

436
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,979
I've got a machete and a revolver
in there. I came in here with it.

437
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,816
Wish I could do more,
but it's all I can spare.

438
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,193
Cut the umbilical cord close
to your baby and tie it off.

439
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:57,861
The part that's connected to you
will expel itself

440
00:28:57,863 --> 00:28:59,114
about an hour after you give birth.

441
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,449
Hey, women have been giving birth

442
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:05,037
since way before people started
calling themselves doctors.

443
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:06,538
You're gonna do great.

444
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,541
Okay. Thank you.

445
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,291
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

446
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,377
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

447
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,755
Ma'am, please, please.
I had a revolver as well. I came...

448
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,757
- I don't know anything about it.
- Ma'am, I got a baby on the way.

449
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,135
My pregnant girlfriend. Please.

450
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:24,264
Look, there are androids out there,
and it's just us. Please.

451
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:29,019
Thank you.

452
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:47,621
G!

453
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:50,622
Georgia!

454
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:08,807
Georgia.

455
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:22,114
Look, G, I'm sorry
that I was...

456
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:26,076
G, I was trying to get us a ride
so that we could go to Boston.

457
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,163
You don't think I can protect you,
but I can.

458
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,258
Protect me?

459
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,095
Asshole. Asshole.

460
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:50,267
You asshole. You dumb asshole.
Asshole. You fucking asshole!

461
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,369
- You okay?
- Yeah.

462
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,896
When the rain dies down,
I'll try to start a fire.

463
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:20,941
We can't.

464
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:22,401
We can't.

465
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,195
We're practically in No Man's Land.

466
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,660
What's going on, baby?
Is it time?

467
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,159
No.

468
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:35,664
It just hurts.

469
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,264
Hey, Georgia.

470
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:56,894
G.

471
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,021
Squirrel.

472
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:01,690
We can’t do this.

473
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,902
We got to get you warm.

474
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,052
Here.

475
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,183
Sam, careful.

476
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,684
It's okay.

477
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:18,600
Come on.

478
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,185
Come on.

479
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:53,510
Look, G, I didn't find
a towel, but...

480
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:54,761
Thank you.

481
00:34:57,723 --> 00:34:58,847
Uh-uh.

482
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:01,683
We are not having sex tonight,
so don't you dare look at me...

483
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,226
I didn't even say anything.

484
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,189
I'm still so mad at you
for being so dumb.

485
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:08,523
It was so fucking dumb, Sam.

486
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,277
I know. I know.

487
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,417
I'm sorry for saying what I said.

488
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,214
I don't know. I was just being...

489
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,007
Hormonal.

490
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:35,302
Watch it.

491
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:37,304
Thin ice.

492
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,556
Ugh! Please tell me

493
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,766
there's a mattress somewhere
in this house I can sleep on.

494
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:45,020
My spine feels like
it's gonna shatter.

495
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:05,749
Anything good yet?

496
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:08,961
No.

497
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,962
Oh.

498
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:55,839
- Do you want me to help you?
- Take this.

499
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,048
- Huh?
- Take this out of my mouth.

500
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,260
- What?
- Just take it!

501
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:02,472
Ow. Okay.

502
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,058
So, good news.

503
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,979
This camera has one more photo in it.

504
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,025
Which means... sometime soon,

505
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,528
you... and me

506
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:19,990
and Spruce

507
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:25,996
can have an actual
real-life family photo.

508
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,629
We are not naming our baby Spruce.

509
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:43,972
Everything we've heard about Boston
is that it's surrounded.

510
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,061
So, we'd have to go up north.

511
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:52,564
Way north.

512
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,942
Maybe New Hampshire,

513
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:57,819
Portsmouth.

514
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,530
And then we'd have
to find a boat or something

515
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,575
to bring us back down
into Boston harbor.

516
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:05,619
How long would that take?

517
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:08,830
Two weeks maybe.

518
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,416
And then there's the boat stuff which

519
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,753
I don't know how to figure that out.

520
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,422
And how long
to cut straight through?

521
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,342
It's 20 miles, so...

522
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,011
two days.

523
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,889
Probably three or four.

524
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:31,395
Twenty miles.

525
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:34,273
No checkpoints.

526
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,402
No EMPs.

527
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,071
Maybe no humans.

528
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:43,991
Lot of androids.

529
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,538
We'd have to be quiet.

530
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,251
Silent.

531
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,255
We would have to be silent.

532
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:06,138
We should have the baby here.

533
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:17,566
That really scares me, G.

534
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:21,987
Me too.

535
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:26,992
What if something goes wrong?

536
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:30,829
That doctor was right, Sam.

537
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:37,044
They make such a big deal
about giving birth, but

538
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:41,463
women used to... give birth

539
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:44,925
and then... I don't know,
cut the umbilical cord with their teeth

540
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,386
and keep on hunting.

541
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:51,016
Oh, what, so you're a hunter now?

542
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,310
Huh?

543
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:55,229
You know what I mean.

544
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:01,235
Once the baby's here,
we could just take our time.

545
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:05,280
Take the long way. It's dry here.

546
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,324
We have supplies.

547
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:12,035
We've been lugging
that medical dictionary around

548
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:14,456
for... six months now.

549
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,460
Why don't we just stop?

550
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,971
You think it’ll ever go back to normal?

551
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,016
No.

552
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:37,187
I mean, I don't even know
if it should.

553
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,028
But I do think it...
could be good still.

554
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:49,324
Someday.

555
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:39,541
Oh my god.

556
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:56,558
Hey.

557
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,856
I got it to turn over
a second ago.

558
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:04,898
Did it wake you up?

559
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,859
No.

560
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:08,529
Um...

561
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:10,906
Take it you saw
the mass grave, huh?

562
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:18,705
It looked... dug up.

563
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:20,999
Animals, I think.

564
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:24,378
What are you doing?

565
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:26,505
Fixing this.

566
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,007
Yeah, but why?

567
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:30,717
We can't take it.

568
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,135
Why not?

569
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,597
'Cause it will attract
too much attention.

570
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,640
We'll just go on foot
once the baby's here.

571
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:41,687
Look, G, I know
you're not gonna like this,

572
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,273
but I need you to hear me out.

573
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:45,607
I'm trying to be smart.

574
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:52,823
You could have this baby today

575
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:54,783
o-or in a week.

576
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:58,410
And I don't feel good about waiting
on the edge of No Man's Land

577
00:42:58,412 --> 00:42:59,913
hoping no one finds us.

578
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,334
You wanna go straight through.

579
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:06,253
It's 20 miles.

580
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:08,253
And if we take this bike,

581
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:09,840
we can get there
by the end of the day.

582
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:16,344
What... happened
to going quietly, Sam?

583
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:18,849
What changed since last night?

584
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:21,977
Okay, G.

585
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:24,688
Let's say you have the baby,

586
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:27,608
and we pull off the homebirth
by ourselves.

587
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:29,818
Then we have a baby

588
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:32,613
who screams when he's hungry

589
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:34,489
or when it's cold.

590
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,117
We've been sneaking around so far,

591
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:39,995
but we're not going to be able
to do that anymore.

592
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:44,164
Let's say we can stay quiet enough
to make it up to New Hampshire.

593
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,543
What kind of boat are we gonna get?
A motorboat?

594
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:49,796
Or gas or a sailboat?

595
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,341
I don't know how to sail, G.

596
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:53,717
Do you?

597
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,512
That's scary to me.

598
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:09,816
Look, G.

599
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:12,859
I see a way that we can do this.

600
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,279
A way to make it okay.

601
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:19,950
G, I know you think
I can't protect you,

602
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:21,326
but I would kill for you.

603
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,330
- Sam...
- I would die for you.

604
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,042
And I would do the same for our baby.

605
00:44:30,212 --> 00:44:31,505
So, please, G.

606
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:32,923
Please.

607
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:34,967
Let me just fix this bike

608
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:37,845
so we can get the hell out
of this dumb situation.

609
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:39,888
Today.

610
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:42,766
Today, G.

611
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:49,938
Okay.

612
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:04,056
Watch our backs.

613
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:08,871
You good, G?

614
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,829
Just my feet.

615
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:11,957
Mm-hmm.

616
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,710
Bet you want some All Stars now,
don't you?

617
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:23,987
Sam.

618
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:32,454
Get your shit, G.
Let's go.

619
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:36,333
Go! Go!

620
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:40,669
- Start!
- Go!

621
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:41,795
Hop on, G, come on!

622
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:53,098
- Did we lose him?
- Hold on.

623
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,933
- G, did we lose him?
- Okay, I think we lost him.

624
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:55,727
Oh shit!

625
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:01,275
G, grab the gun!

626
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:10,949
- Keep it straight.
- Georgia.

627
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:11,992
Keep it straight!

628
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:13,245
- Georgia!
- Keep it straight!

629
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:14,870
Georgia!

630
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:16,999
I got her.

631
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:23,630
G, you need to stop?

632
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:26,756
Don't stop!

633
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:28,425
Fuck, G!

634
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:29,801
Come on.
Go, go, go! Don't stop!

635
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:30,510
Oh shit.

636
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:31,678
Don't slow down!

637
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:07,883
Fuck!

638
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,321
Go!

639
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:48,549
Sam.

640
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:52,010
Sam, we can't outrun them.

641
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:12,153
- You need to get off!
- What?

642
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:13,405
Give me the gun.
I'm gonna distract them.

643
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:14,865
- Sam!
- Georgia, listen to me.

644
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:17,284
This is the only shot we've got.
If they chase after me, you can get away.

645
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:18,243
- No!
- Go back to the river.

646
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,536
I'll meet you there.
I can outrun them.

647
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:20,289
Sam!

648
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:22,833
Sam! Sam!

649
00:51:25,544 --> 00:51:26,378
Ah!

650
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:18,011
Run, G!

651
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:57,678
They won't stop.

652
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:01,348
If you don't want them to catch you,
come with me now.

653
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:03,265
My boyfriend...

654
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:04,142
They've taken him.

655
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:05,100
Where?

656
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:06,434
I can help you, but you have
to come with me.

657
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:23,036
Let me help you.

658
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:27,416
Please.

659
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:49,519
Where are we going?

660
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:50,939
Shh.

661
00:53:52,149 --> 00:53:53,233
They're everywhere.

662
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:11,752
It's okay.

663
00:54:13,754 --> 00:54:14,628
Come on.

664
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:46,912
Is it safe to speak here?

665
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:58,757
You did all of this?

666
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:03,971
How have they
not found this place?

667
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:07,391
Or you?

668
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:10,769
Hey!

669
00:55:12,938 --> 00:55:13,981
Who are you?

670
00:55:18,652 --> 00:55:20,195
You ever hear of Karel Capek?

671
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,656
Is that you?

672
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:24,283
No.

673
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:26,535
He was a writer.

674
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:28,287
Czech.

675
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:31,331
In 1920, he wrote a play.

676
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:34,835
<i>Rossumovi Univerzalni Roboti.</i>

677
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:38,964
And what does that have
to do with anything?

678
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:41,091
In it, a man,

679
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:42,676
scientist,

680
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,012
tries to create new life.

681
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:47,681
Prove that there was no god.

682
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:52,352
His creations, the Roboti,

683
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:56,523
were these artificial creatures
with living flesh and blood components.

684
00:55:57,983 --> 00:55:59,943
Essentially what
the modern android is.

685
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:02,112
They look like us.

686
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:03,906
They talk like us.

687
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:07,743
And it's commonplace to mistake
a Roboti for a human.

688
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:09,786
And at first,

689
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:11,997
they seemed happy to serve man.

690
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:14,291
But in the end,

691
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:18,295
a Roboti rebellion leads
to the extinction of human life.

692
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:22,382
This play

693
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:25,761
introduced the word Robot
to human language

694
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:28,847
and it ends with our extinction.

695
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:32,976
We knew what was coming
the second we gave it a name.

696
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:35,187
But sure, let's build

697
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:38,732
million dollar butlers and assume
it's all going to be okay.

698
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:43,862
So fucking arrogant.

699
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:53,997
What did you do there?

700
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:55,999
AI programmer.

701
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:00,671
I'm alive because I know
how they think.

702
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:05,715
What happened that night,

703
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:07,219
the night of the Blitz?

704
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:10,055
They were supposed
to be programmed not to kill us.

705
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:12,558
What went wrong?

706
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:15,978
What went wrong

707
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:19,106
was we built them in the first place.

708
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:25,571
- I need to sleep.
- Wait.

709
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:30,617
What's your name?

710
00:57:33,161 --> 00:57:34,162
Arthur.

711
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:57,519
Thank you.

712
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:28,550
What's wrong with you?

713
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:35,057
I'm having contractions.

714
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:37,726
Has your water broken?

715
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,022
No.

716
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:45,984
Sam.

717
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:48,362
I gotta find Sam.

718
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:54,535
Ah.

719
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:57,037
You need to forget about your friend.

720
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:03,627
He's not my friend.

721
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:05,504
He's...

722
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:09,341
He's the father.

723
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:12,761
Look,

724
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:15,973
I'm sorry for what
you're going through.

725
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:18,642
I know it's not easy.

726
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:22,354
But you need to get
with the program here.

727
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:25,315
They're not butlers anymore.

728
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:27,609
They're killing machines.

729
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:30,279
And they've jumped
the evolutionary chain.

730
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,864
They've hacked our programming,
and they'll use it against us

731
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:34,867
until we're all dead.

732
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:38,120
Hacked our... programming,
what do you mean?

733
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:42,958
We're not robots.
You can't hack us.

734
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:46,003
Love.

735
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:49,715
I know it sounds dumb,
but that's what it is.

736
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:55,095
Human beings are programmed
through hormones and primal urges

737
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:57,514
to have emotional connections.

738
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:00,767
It's what kept us alive this long.

739
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:04,479
Parents, spouses, children.

740
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:08,025
But an android doesn't have that.

741
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:10,527
An android is expendable.

742
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,738
They don't have self-preservation,
and they'll sacrifice themselves

743
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,657
and others

744
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:17,951
if it brings them closer
to their goal.

745
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,704
They can reason
past sentiment

746
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:22,331
and emotional bond.

747
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,209
It's love.

748
01:00:27,753 --> 01:00:29,254
Love makes us selfish.

749
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:32,925
Love will kill us all.

750
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,432
I-I can't leave him to die.

751
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:49,775
You want to live?

752
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:52,152
Of course.

753
01:00:58,116 --> 01:00:59,076
Save yourself.

754
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:01,954
That's what they would do.

755
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:04,748
They have strategy like
you wouldn't believe.

756
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,167
Please.

757
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:09,461
Please.

758
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:11,797
Just listen to me.

759
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:15,300
Why do you care so much?

760
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:25,686
Can I?

761
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:04,725
Hey.

762
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:07,352
Hey.

763
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:13,148
Shh. Shh.

764
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,610
- They're all dead.
- I know.

765
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:16,320
- They're all dead.
- I know.

766
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,988
They're all dead.

767
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,238
They're all dead.

768
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,116
I know.

769
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,328
It's okay.

770
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:27,039
Hey, it's okay.

771
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:28,999
Shh.

772
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:30,916
I'm sorry.

773
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:43,388
I'm sorry.

774
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:47,851
You were headed
to Boston, right?

775
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:51,813
I can take you.

776
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:55,234
I can get you there.
I can get you there safe.

777
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:56,610
How?

778
01:02:58,862 --> 01:02:59,696
This.

779
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:06,618
About eight years ago, we started
developing camouflage algorithms

780
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,330
for our complex
in Eastern Europe.

781
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:11,373
Androids see UV,

782
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,583
heat sensors, night vision.

783
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:17,464
But this algorithm created a mask
against all of that.

784
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:19,089
That makes you invisible?

785
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:20,050
To the eye.

786
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:21,550
But they can hear you.

787
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:23,762
They can smell you.
They're not stupid.

788
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:26,056
They know this tech exists,
so they look for you.

789
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:29,309
But it gives us a shot.

790
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,441
I'm not leaving without Sam.

791
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:38,777
This...

792
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:43,446
camouflage or whatever
you want to call it,

793
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:44,616
it gives me a chance.

794
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:47,327
To go and get him.

795
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:50,247
I'm not letting you take
my armor for that.

796
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:54,668
Fine. Then keep it.

797
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:57,504
It doesn't matter either way.
I'm gonna go get him.

798
01:03:58,755 --> 01:03:59,756
You can die.

799
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:08,265
I really did try to help you.

800
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:10,559
I hope you remember that.

801
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,615
Let's go.

802
01:04:57,314 --> 01:04:58,230
No! No! No!

803
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:04,196
Please, just let me go.

804
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:14,665
Ah! No! Please. No, no!

805
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:27,845
See the movement?

806
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:29,970
Yeah.

807
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:30,806
Patrols.

808
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:38,146
What are they doing to them?

809
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:40,480
Using them as bait.

810
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:41,525
For who?

811
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:44,111
For you.

812
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,531
He won't be the only one
they've captured.

813
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:52,870
You're not coming with me?

814
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,289
I only have two.

815
01:05:56,248 --> 01:05:58,166
You're gonna need one for him
if you want to get him out of there.

816
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:05,591
Are you sure this thing works?

817
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:10,762
Yeah. Why wouldn't it?

818
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:15,642
You find him and you put this on him.

819
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:20,105
Get him out of there
and you do it silently.

820
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:23,442
They're going to notice he's disappeared.

821
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:26,361
You have four miles till you get
to the edge of No Man's Land.

822
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:29,698
They won't stop until they detect
the EMP radius signal.

823
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:30,949
Understand?

824
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:34,494
Or you could just walk away.

825
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:37,998
You could walk away right now.

826
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:40,459
He would never know.

827
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:46,924
I'd know.

828
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:09,006
Let me out! Let me out!

829
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:41,489
Okay.

830
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:56,590
Sam. Sam.

831
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:01,553
G...

832
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:03,263
What did they do to you?

833
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:05,055
G, get out of here.

834
01:11:05,057 --> 01:11:06,223
- Hey!
- I'm here now.

835
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:07,516
Hey!

836
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:08,894
- Shh.
- Please help me out.

837
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:10,810
Stop it. Be quiet.

838
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,729
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

839
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:14,481
They're in there. Please.
Be quiet.

840
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:16,568
Stop it. Be quiet.
Please be quiet.

841
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:18,068
- Be quiet.
- I can help you.

842
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,696
- I can help you. Just let me out.
- Wait. Stop it.

843
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:21,406
Please be quiet. Please.

844
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:30,582
Hey.

845
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,960
Hey, come here,
you fucking piece of shit!

846
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:34,461
Come here!

847
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:36,253
Come here, you fucking...

848
01:11:57,985 --> 01:11:59,109
Sam. Wait.

849
01:11:59,111 --> 01:11:59,987
Hey!

850
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,823
Hey! Hey, come on.
Just help me out.

851
01:12:03,282 --> 01:12:04,241
I can help you.

852
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,241
- Bitch!
- Put this on.

853
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:07,242
- Bitch!
- Put this on.

854
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:10,120
If you don't fucking help me,
I'm gonna scream.

855
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:12,956
And every single one of those
motherfuckers is gonna come in here.

856
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:14,040
Let's go.

857
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:15,417
Hey!

858
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:17,504
- Stop it!
- Hey!

859
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:19,256
Hey! Come on!

860
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,632
Hey! Get me out of here. Come on!

861
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,955
No. It's happening.

862
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:00,378
We have to move.

863
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:23,111
Sam.

864
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:33,640
Try not to move.

865
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:39,688
Ow! Where am I?

866
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,023
Boston.

867
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:52,492
Where's Sam?

868
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,161
He's right there.

869
01:14:58,081 --> 01:14:59,166
Hi, Squirrel.

870
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:02,002
Hey.

871
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:07,797
He's been through a lot,
but before we talk about Sam

872
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:09,676
I think we should talk about this...

873
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:14,431
healthy baby boy.

874
01:15:18,936 --> 01:15:19,937
I told you.

875
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,318
Hey.

876
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:32,115
Hi, baby.

877
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:35,953
Your friend has been resting.

878
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:38,038
He collapsed after getting you here.

879
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:40,040
They're gonna want to talk to him
when he wakes up.

880
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:44,962
How did we get here?

881
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:47,005
He got you
through the checkpoint.

882
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:49,758
Caused quite a fuss
with the soldiers.

883
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:54,636
But when they saw you were midway
through delivery and unconscious,

884
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:56,849
we got you in here
and performed a C-section.

885
01:15:58,308 --> 01:15:59,184
Thank you.

886
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:04,648
It's a nice change
having some life here.

887
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:08,942
Some base personnel are going
to be coming by

888
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:11,736
to ask a few questions,
security related.

889
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:13,363
I told them that you need your rest,

890
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:15,117
but they just need
to clear some things up.

891
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,583
Excuse me. I...

892
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:26,879
The base nurse
should be in here.

893
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:28,213
Hey, love.

894
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:36,346
Yeah. Let's go say hi
to daddy.

895
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:39,641
Oh.

896
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:42,269
Come here.
Give me your little hands.

897
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:50,736
Hi.

898
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:52,613
You want to say hi
to Daddy?

899
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:56,992
Oh, little man.

900
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:08,837
Waiting for you, buddy.

901
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:13,550
I think we can all agree

902
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:16,970
that in hindsight,

903
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,014
my plan to get us here
was a stunning success.

904
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:25,979
We're a wreck,

905
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:29,316
but we did it.

906
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:33,612
You haven't even seen
the worst part yet, G.

907
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:40,869
Okay, this is really not a funny way
to tell you this, but...

908
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:58,134
Oh, Sam.

909
01:17:58,136 --> 01:17:59,179
It's alright.

910
01:18:00,639 --> 01:18:02,057
Why'd they do this to you?

911
01:18:03,517 --> 01:18:05,060
I was all smashed up.

912
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:07,771
It was the best they could do.

913
01:18:09,106 --> 01:18:11,273
They said we'd know in a few days
if I'm going to be okay,

914
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:14,069
but... I just got
to take it easy for now.

915
01:18:15,821 --> 01:18:19,408
But... soon as we get to Korea,

916
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:22,995
I'm for sure getting
some of those robot feet.

917
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:26,999
'Cause that definitely sounds safe.

918
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:35,132
Shh.

919
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:36,800
Why are you so good?

920
01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:41,970
Because it's what dads
are supposed to be.

921
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:50,480
Okay.

922
01:18:51,565 --> 01:18:52,608
Forest.

923
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:54,484
Huh?

924
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,278
Forest.

925
01:18:58,739 --> 01:18:59,448
Yeah.

926
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:03,619
He feels like Forest to me.

927
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,250
- What's your name?
- Georgia.

928
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:12,044
Olsen.

929
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:13,295
And his name?

930
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:15,005
Sam.

931
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:16,840
Samuel Hoth.

932
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:18,842
And the guy who brought you here?

933
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:22,471
Arthur. I don't...

934
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:24,806
I don't know his last name.

935
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:27,476
- So you came from?
- Central Mass.

936
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:29,061
Near the Quabbin.

937
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:33,065
We, uh,

938
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:36,525
we ended up making it to Philly

939
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:38,070
before we looped back up.

940
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:40,989
We were trying to get out of the country
with The Family Initiative.

941
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:45,784
We heard that they were still getting
people out of Boston. Is that true?

942
01:19:45,786 --> 01:19:46,703
Yeah. They are.

943
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:55,377
Can I speak with you about...

944
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:56,171
Oh, we're not done.

945
01:19:59,091 --> 01:19:59,881
Okay.

946
01:19:59,883 --> 01:20:02,094
So how'd you meet the guy, Arthur?

947
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:04,680
Well, I guess I'll start with the...

948
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:08,058
We had to get across
the No Man's Land.

949
01:20:09,393 --> 01:20:11,977
And we didn't want to risk
giving birth there.

950
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:15,063
So... we found this dirt bike
and we decided

951
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,356
to use that to get across

952
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:20,863
and we only got halfway
before we ran into some androids.

953
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:23,156
They separated us.

954
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:27,742
I hid, but they, they took Sam.

955
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:29,578
They took him? For what?

956
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:30,581
I don't know.

957
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:32,583
I mean, they just,

958
01:20:33,834 --> 01:20:34,835
they took him.

959
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:37,379
They held him prisoner.
They had a,

960
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:39,673
a house full of prisoners.

961
01:20:47,014 --> 01:20:49,057
So, how'd you meet this guy, Arthur?

962
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:52,728
He was in th-the woods
when it happened. He...

963
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:54,769
He saved me.

964
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:55,606
How?

965
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:58,901
He took me back to his truck. And he...

966
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:01,528
Well, he helped me

967
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:04,237
figure out a way
to get Sam out of the house

968
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,032
and so I,

969
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:07,993
I went in and I got him.

970
01:21:08,744 --> 01:21:10,537
You just walked in?

971
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:16,001
I mean, you probably saw it
on the truck already. But he...

972
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:21,298
Uh, he used to work
at... Raster Robotics.

973
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:25,177
He told you that?

974
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:26,637
Yes.

975
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:29,681
So he, he was a,

976
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:33,769
um, a programmer
and he built this,

977
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:37,397
this armor, um, that

978
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:41,276
camouflages you
from the androids.

979
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:44,905
It makes you invisible to them.

980
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:47,407
What?

981
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:51,745
You put it on, and it makes you
invisible to the androids.

982
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,915
He told you
it makes you invisible?

983
01:21:57,251 --> 01:21:58,961
He didn't...
he didn't just tell me.

984
01:22:00,212 --> 01:22:01,171
I used it.

985
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:03,755
I went in, and I, and I,

986
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:05,592
and I went into the house
and I wore it,

987
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:08,887
and they couldn't see me.

988
01:22:09,263 --> 01:22:10,180
What?

989
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,097
What?

990
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:14,852
You just walked into the house,
and they couldn't see you?

991
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:17,686
Yes.

992
01:22:17,688 --> 01:22:19,398
That technology doesn't exist.

993
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:30,242
Okay. Well,

994
01:22:32,786 --> 01:22:35,328
I'm telling you that it does
because I wore it, and it worked.

995
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:38,041
And I'm telling you if that existed,
don't you think we'd be using it?

996
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:41,753
So you need to start straightening
this story out so it starts making sense.

997
01:22:42,754 --> 01:22:45,215
What... happened out there?

998
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:49,803
<i>Human beings are programmed
to have emotional connections.</i>

999
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:53,763
<i>Parents, spouses, children.</i>

1000
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:56,183
They're all dead.
They're all dead.

1001
01:22:56,185 --> 01:22:57,352
They're all dead.

1002
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,980
<i>An android is expendable.</i>

1003
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:03,857
They don't have self-preservation,
and they'll sacrifice themselves

1004
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,403
and others if it brings them
closer to their goal.

1005
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:11,158
They have strategy
like you wouldn't believe.

1006
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:17,497
I think I made a mistake.

1007
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:44,233
Wait here.

1008
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,460
It's okay. It's okay.

1009
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,129
Sam, get up!

1010
01:24:07,047 --> 01:24:08,131
Sam, get up!

1011
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:26,441
Come on. Sam!

1012
01:24:26,692 --> 01:24:27,524
You gotta wake up.

1013
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:34,324
EMP.

1014
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:37,327
He's going to disable the EMP.

1015
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:48,213
I'm gonna come back. I promise.

1016
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:09,566
Go, go, go, go!

1017
01:25:09,568 --> 01:25:11,278
Breach! Breach!

1018
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:13,195
Swarm 8s!

1019
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:23,582
On your left!

1020
01:25:55,948 --> 01:25:58,700
It's okay. Don't cry.
Be quiet. Mama's here.

1021
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:00,494
Please be quiet.

1022
01:26:13,549 --> 01:26:14,466
Yes!

1023
01:26:19,972 --> 01:26:21,014
I warned you.

1024
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:25,644
What are you gonna do
with that?

1025
01:26:29,857 --> 01:26:30,983
They're all dead.

1026
01:26:32,526 --> 01:26:33,610
They're all dead.

1027
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:36,238
They're all dead.

1028
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:38,446
They're all dead.

1029
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:40,784
They're all dead.
They're all dead.

1030
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:42,911
They're all dead.
They're all dead.

1031
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:45,245
They're all dead.
They're all dead.

1032
01:26:57,009 --> 01:26:59,636
We were programmed to be emotive
to make you feel comfort.

1033
01:27:01,638 --> 01:27:02,389
Are you comfortable?

1034
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:06,059
Boston's going down today.

1035
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:07,769
You can't stop us now.

1036
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:11,523
So,

1037
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:14,318
are you going to disable
that EMP for me?

1038
01:27:16,028 --> 01:27:17,487
Or you going to make me kill
your baby?

1039
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:20,657
Oh my god.

1040
01:27:23,118 --> 01:27:23,825
Stop!

1041
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:26,288
Stop!

1042
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:57,361
Fuck.

1043
01:28:29,268 --> 01:28:30,018
Fuck.

1044
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:49,014
Hey.

1045
01:29:50,557 --> 01:29:51,600
Hey.

1046
01:30:00,484 --> 01:30:01,652
I love you, Sam.

1047
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:06,615
I love you, too, Squirrel.

1048
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:32,975
Sam.

1049
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:35,978
Take it.

1050
01:30:56,498 --> 01:30:57,332
G.

1051
01:30:59,084 --> 01:30:59,916
Hmm.

1052
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:02,421
We gotta move.

1053
01:31:36,163 --> 01:31:37,370
Over here! Wait!

1054
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:38,749
Wait. Here!

1055
01:31:39,374 --> 01:31:41,001
Please, over here.

1056
01:31:45,631 --> 01:31:47,591
He's going to scan you.
Do not move.

1057
01:31:58,018 --> 01:31:58,852
Remove.

1058
01:32:08,612 --> 01:32:12,407
I-I-I don't know what paperwork
you might need or...

1059
01:32:12,991 --> 01:32:15,075
We, we don't, we don't have anything,
but I just...

1060
01:32:15,077 --> 01:32:16,036
I'm sorry.

1061
01:32:16,954 --> 01:32:19,746
I, I know that
you only take the mothers.

1062
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:21,458
I can only take the baby.

1063
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:28,296
What?

1064
01:32:28,298 --> 01:32:30,217
Korea will only take the baby.

1065
01:32:30,717 --> 01:32:31,927
Not the parents.

1066
01:32:36,932 --> 01:32:37,766
Please.

1067
01:32:38,976 --> 01:32:40,684
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I don't think you understand.

1068
01:32:40,686 --> 01:32:41,643
- No, please.
- There's not the space.

1069
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:42,936
Please. Please just...

1070
01:32:42,938 --> 01:32:45,188
You can take us.
It's only three of us.

1071
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:48,900
I-I-I promise I will do... anything.

1072
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:50,360
- Please, just please.
- I'm sorry.

1073
01:32:50,362 --> 01:32:52,406
- Please take us.
- It's not just the space.

1074
01:32:53,031 --> 01:32:54,658
You're another mouth to feed.

1075
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:58,245
Another person to take care
for medical attention.

1076
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:01,997
When you get to Korea,
you will need a job.

1077
01:33:01,999 --> 01:33:04,001
You will need a house.
You see?

1078
01:33:06,336 --> 01:33:07,129
Please.

1079
01:33:08,005 --> 01:33:09,173
The baby is simple.

1080
01:33:12,301 --> 01:33:13,302
But you're not.

1081
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:19,766
He's very ill.

1082
01:33:28,775 --> 01:33:29,484
G.

1083
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:38,867
I'm gonna make it work.
I'm gonna get us on the plane.

1084
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:40,662
I-I'm gonna get us on the boat,
I promise.

1085
01:33:42,456 --> 01:33:43,332
It's gonna be okay.

1086
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:46,668
It's gonna be okay.

1087
01:33:47,044 --> 01:33:48,752
I don't think I'm gonna pull
through this, G.

1088
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:49,796
Don't say that.

1089
01:33:50,088 --> 01:33:52,214
- We'll be fine. We'll be fine.
- Just listen, Just listen to me.

1090
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:53,550
G, if he stays here,

1091
01:33:55,219 --> 01:33:56,553
there's a good chance he'll die.

1092
01:33:59,306 --> 01:34:00,599
If he's out there,

1093
01:34:02,142 --> 01:34:03,519
there's a good chance he'll live.

1094
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:09,274
Look at me, G.

1095
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:10,901
I'm fucked.

1096
01:34:14,071 --> 01:34:15,197
I'm bleeding out here.

1097
01:34:17,074 --> 01:34:18,992
I don't think I'm fully pulling
through this.

1098
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,790
I can't protect you, G.

1099
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:28,961
And you can't really protect him.

1100
01:34:29,378 --> 01:34:30,379
Not really.

1101
01:34:34,049 --> 01:34:35,384
This could be a good thing.

1102
01:34:40,806 --> 01:34:42,391
Let's give him a chance.

1103
01:34:46,478 --> 01:34:47,604
Yeah.

1104
01:34:54,069 --> 01:34:55,237
I love you, buddy.

1105
01:35:22,514 --> 01:35:24,181
Can I just have one minute?

1106
01:35:24,183 --> 01:35:26,059
Just one minute, please. Just...

1107
01:35:27,144 --> 01:35:28,145
Fill this out.

1108
01:35:30,147 --> 01:35:31,356
Thank you.

1109
01:36:03,055 --> 01:36:03,889
<i>My boy.</i>

1110
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:06,350
<i>My son.</i>

1111
01:36:10,687 --> 01:36:11,647

<i>I didn't want

1113
01:36:20,322 --> 01:36:23,367
<i>I would have done anything
to give you a normal life.</i>

1114
01:36:27,538 --> 01:36:28,997
<i>One with parents</i>

1115
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:31,917
<i>and a home</i>

1116
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:34,628
<i>and friends down the street.</i>

1117
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:39,049
<i>You would have gone to school
in the city that you were born</i>

1118
01:36:39,967 --> 01:36:42,634
<i>and come home
and told us about your day.</i>

1119
01:36:49,142 --> 01:36:51,019
<i>We would have
taken summers on the shore.</i>

1120
01:36:53,856 --> 01:36:56,189
<i>And that's where some
of the most intense memories</i>

1121
01:36:56,191 --> 01:36:57,401
<i>of childhood would have been.</i>

1122
01:37:04,825 --> 01:37:07,160
<i>Your father would have read
to you in silly voices.</i>

1123
01:37:09,496 --> 01:37:12,163
<i>You would go to sleep
dreaming of the adventures</i>

1124
01:37:12,165 --> 01:37:14,084
<i>you would have
with your friends in the woods.</i>

1125
01:37:22,009 --> 01:37:23,135
<i>In the perfect world,</i>

1126
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,093
<i>none of this
would have happened.</i>

1127
01:37:28,223 --> 01:37:31,310
<i>We would have worked to be
the best parents that we could have been.</i>

1128
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:35,898
<i>We would have been a family</i>

1129
01:37:37,733 --> 01:37:39,610
<i>and the world wouldn't be
falling apart.</i>

1130
01:37:43,488 --> 01:37:44,990
<i>But I can't give you that.</i>

1131
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:49,453
<i>I can't give you any of it.</i>

1132
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:53,332
<i>So instead,</i>

1133
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:57,336
<i>I'm going to give you
the only thing that I have left.</i>

1134
01:38:00,756 --> 01:38:01,882
<i>A chance.</i>

1135
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:06,803
<i>A chance at a normal life,</i>

1136
01:38:08,931 --> 01:38:11,348
<i>with a new family
in a new place.</i>

1137
01:38:17,147 --> 01:38:19,149
<i>I need you to know
that I love you.</i>

1138
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:23,654
<i>I need you to know
that I wanted you.</i>

1139
01:38:25,197 --> 01:38:26,907
<i>God, I wanted you in my life. I...</i>

1140
01:38:28,325 --> 01:38:29,952
<i>I wanted you by my side.</i>

1141
01:38:33,705 --> 01:38:35,121
- <i>I just couldn't...</i>
- It's time to go.

1142
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:38,834
Please let me finish this.
I'm almost done. If you just...

1143
01:38:38,836 --> 01:38:40,502
Sorry. We must go now.

1144
01:38:51,515 --> 01:38:53,725
Okay. Okay

1145
01:38:59,231 --> 01:39:00,107
Okay.

1146
01:39:15,539 --> 01:39:16,498
Here.

1147
01:39:26,425 --> 01:39:27,259
What's your name?

1148
01:39:28,135 --> 01:39:29,178
Soyoung.

1149
01:39:33,015 --> 01:39:35,309
Please find someone
who will take care of him.

1150
01:39:37,394 --> 01:39:38,687
Someone who will love him.

1151
01:39:39,813 --> 01:39:40,939
Please.

1152
01:40:11,094 --> 01:40:12,804
- He's gonna be okay.
- He's gonna be okay.

1153
01:40:13,055 --> 01:40:14,806
- He's gonna be okay.
- He's gonna be okay.

1154
