00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,030
I am Black Ren.
I belong to the Hung Society in China.

3
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,541
My rank is Red Flag.

4
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:23,877
Today,
I come to you with a proposition:

5
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,451
We all came to Hong Kong

6
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,350
seeking a better life.

7
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:35,359
To succeed and prosper
we must live in harmony.

8
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,066
When disputes arise,
we must negotiate a solution,

9
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,901
before resorting to force.

10
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,339
If a conflict can't be avoided,

11
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,072
A date will be set for duel.

12
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:59,447
But the authorities
shall never hear of this.

13
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,989
We should adopt
the rules of Hung Society.

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:10,620
United under its philosophy.

15
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:50,627
The brethren
shall live together peacefully.

16
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,288
Every sect shall carry the name "Wo",

17
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,766
for unity.

18
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:23,427
Shenzhen, Nanshan

19
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,966
Impressive, Jimmy!

20
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:37,509
This logistics center is a great idea.

21
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,771
I've sold bootleg discs all over China.

22
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:43,973
Why waste
such a good distribution network.

23
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,575
You've become a real businessman.

24
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,984
Secretary Chou, is everything ready?

25
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,421
Yes. There's nothing to worry,
Mr. Lee.

26
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,287
We're on top of everything.

27
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,123
The new highway

28
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:01,666
will reduce travel time
to Hong Kong by 20%.

29
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:06,170
I hope the trade office
will help us out here.

30
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,175
We will do everything we can.

31
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,438
Thanks, Section Chief.

32
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,915
I should be the one to thank you.

33
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,642
Great project.
The ball park is in millions.

34
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,977
I'm in.

35
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,313
Jimmy,
your connections are your business.

36
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,444
Just make sure your past...

37
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,455
...doesn't hurt our future.

38
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:02,550
Do you understand?

39
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,686
You have my word, Mr. Kwok.

40
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,765
Thank you for your support.

41
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,063
Secretary Chief.

42
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,870
Mr. Kwok is pleased.

43
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,576
We all worked hard on this.

44
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,778
I'll bring you
the 20 million next week.

45
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,906
I want a mansion here.

46
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,498
Second floor will have 3 rooms.

47
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,877
One room is for us.

48
00:06:55,481 --> 00:07:00,418
The other two are for our children.

49
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:06,089
They'll become doctors
or lawyers someday.

50
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,526
What do you say?

51
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:22,307
I just want us to be together.

52
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,612
Pay your respect.
Happy birthday Chairman Lok.

53
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,389
Happy birthday, Godfather.

54
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,995
Thanks. Let's drink!

55
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,277
You all have given so much...

56
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,285
...to the Society.

57
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:13,016
I'm proud of my godsons.

58
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,651
The next Chairman election
is approaching. Any plans?

59
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,789
My clients will support me.

60
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:25,804
So you're going to run?

61
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:30,871
Kun went to prison for us.
The Society owes him.

62
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,671
You killed a traffic cop.

63
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,145
It's not as if
you killed the police commissioner!

64
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,678
The five of you
have been great help to me.

65
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,789
So?

66
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,084
The past is behind us.

67
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,687
Only the strongest candidate
deserves to win.

68
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,303
Godfather, will you support me?

69
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:06,439
You don't need me to win.

70
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:16,479
Believe me, I'll do whatever it takes.

71
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,685
Jimmy, you have a good shot too.

72
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,888
I'm just a businessman.

73
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:30,992
But the title
can increase your bootleg business.

74
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,001
It will attract too much attention.

75
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,201
It'll harm business.

76
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,710
Don't give up
this golden opportunity.

77
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,373
What's so impressive
about selling porn?

78
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,578
Money brings respect.
If I had his success,

79
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,122
people would know me as Mr. So.

80
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,262
Godfather, I want to do business
in China like Jimmy.

81
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,064
Don't like the job I gave you?

82
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:10,539
No... I just want to make more money.

83
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,045
I'm not stopping you.

84
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,239
Thanks, Godfather.

85
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,018
Everyone looks up to you, Jimmy.

86
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,917
All thanks to you.

87
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,387
Welcome.
Hello, Mr. Shu.

88
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,926
Mr. Shu, this is Mr. Kwok.

89
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,222
Mr. Shu.
Thank you...

90
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,127
Thanks for
contributing to the charity fund.

91
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,029
That's 2 schools in China.

92
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,763
I hear Mr. Shu
has a successful business in China.

93
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,466
Jimmy and I
have a lot to learn from you.

94
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,476
Sure. Have Jimmy call me.

95
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,340
Great.

96
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,708
Please take your seat.

97
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,180
Jimmy,
there's someone I want you to meet.

98
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,443
Please excuse me.

99
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,948
Mr. Xi, I'd like to introduce you...

100
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,718
Jimmy.

101
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:10,301
Well well,
Wo Sing's No.1moneymaker.

102
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,097
Impressive!

103
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,968
Mr. Xi
is from the Chinese Security Bureau.

104
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,348
Isn't Lok your Godfather?

105
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,411
Here's a tip:
Don't follow his example.

106
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,217
He's out of control.

107
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,852
You guys should be keeping it cool.

108
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,971
The next Chairman election is near.

109
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,098
You gonna run?

110
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,809
No.

111
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,042
What's going on with your lot?

112
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,516
Please excuse me.

113
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,450
The infighting has to stop.

114
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,351
Someone used a gas bomb last week.

115
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,117
Civilians were hurt, looks real bad.

116
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,226
I'll take care of it, Mr. Xi.

117
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,238
You friends with Mr. So?

118
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:33,277
He runs a gambling ring in China.
We're onto him.

119
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,153
He'll arrive in Shenzhen in 2 days.

120
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,781
That's where he'll get in trouble.

121
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:43,085
"This is Mr. So's voicemail."

122
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,122
"Please leave a message."

123
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,628
Things are looking up for you.

124
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,257
You're in bed with some big guns.

125
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,235
It's just business.

126
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,634
Why don't you run for Chairman?

127
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,297
I'm only a businessman.

128
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:06,775
That shouldn't stop you.

129
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,370
I can't be the Chairman.

130
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,983
The law will be all over me.

131
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,677
How can I take my business public?

132
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,788
Let's talk some other time Uncle Teng.

133
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,617
I can't do this right now.

134
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,349
What do you mean?

135
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,290
You're a part of the Society!

136
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,296
I joined for protection.

137
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,458
What's the point of
becoming the biggest gangster?

138
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,467
I'm only in it for the money.

139
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,799
Don't forget that we made you rich.

140
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,238
You can't just walk away!

141
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,288
Last few years profits...

142
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,221
...are through the roof.

143
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,225
All thanks to you.

144
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,129
You've always stood by me.

145
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:04,225
You gave your life for me.

146
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,670
Everyone knows Jet is my right hand.

147
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:19,812
He tells everyone I killed his boss.

148
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,986
So when can I
stop hiding and help you?

149
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,028
Very soon.

150
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:35,793
I will make you the next Chairman.

151
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,201
You deserve it.

152
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,829
Thank you, Godfather.

153
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,032
Still working as a bouncer?

154
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,606
Doesn't pay much.

155
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:29,346
I get by from collecting your debts.

156
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,475
Come and help me.

157
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,486
My boss won't like it.

158
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,319
I'm the boss of your boss.

159
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,357
Thanks Jimmy.

160
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,581
"This is Mr. So's voicemail."

161
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,481
"Please leave a message."

162
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,686
Shenzhen, China

163
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,437
Welcome.

164
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,639
Is the Section Chief here?
This way.

165
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,680
Section Chief.

166
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:50,788
Here, your permits are ready.

167
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:58,634
Anyone else waits 3 years
for these babies.

168
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,462
Cheers.

169
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,471
Cheers.

170
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,675
The cash is ready.

171
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,110
I want to be careful.

172
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:14,185
One can never be too careful.

173
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,186
Come.

174
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,729
Jimmy.

175
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,095
All yours.

176
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,422
Something's wrong.

177
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,024
What is it?

178
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,598
We have company.

179
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,496
Police?

180
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,500
Let's go!

181
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,904
Let's go!
Wait!

182
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,704
This is Mr. So.

183
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,406
This is my new number:

184
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,384
13845687790

185
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,179
Mr. So.
Old Huang!

186
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,019
This way.

187
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,762
Have a seat.

188
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,762
I'll get you tea.

189
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,333
Thanks.
Don't mention it.

190
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,130
They're not here for us.

191
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:55,383
"This is Mr. So's voicemail."

192
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,420
"Please leave a message."

193
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:02,550
I lost my cell. Call me at this number.

194
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,355
Bye.

195
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,363
Excuse me.
Yes.

196
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,538
Give this to the guy with glasses.

197
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,442
Yes.

198
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,068
"Police are here"

199
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,076
Nice working with you.

200
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,949
Move!

201
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,744
Police! Freeze!

202
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,686
Police! Freeze!

203
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,418
Jimmy, let's go!

204
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,456
Go.

205
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,057
Freeze!

206
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,693
There's no way out Mr. Lee.

207
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,071
What's all this for?

208
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,047
Mr. Lee, you are under arrest.

209
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,361
Right, Lok is a good leader.

210
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,728
He should be re-elected.

211
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,232
Are you drunk?

212
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,826
You can't break the tradition.
Uncle Teng won't have it.

213
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,270
Sorry.

214
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,606
I just want to see if you'll support me.

215
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,042
Lok.

216
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,206
You made us rich these...

217
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,818
...last 2 years.

218
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,580
Of course we'll support you.

219
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,247
If the other contenders are weak,

220
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,383
we'll put pressure on Uncle Teng.

221
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:54,693
Your brothers will stand by you.

222
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,460
Does Kun have a shot?

223
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,662
No chance at all. He's too reckless.

224
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:06,335
How about Jimmy?
He runs a profitable business.

225
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,606
Many brothers are working for him.

226
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,215
Uncle Teng likes him.

227
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,113
They saw each other
a couple days ago.

228
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:19,713
If Jimmy runs,
you can forget about a second term.

229
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,308
Get your own food.

230
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,421
Get in line.

231
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,865
Don't worry.

232
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:16,675
My friend from the Security Bureau
will help us.

233
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,840
Do you mean Mr. Xi?

234
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,391
Jimmy Lee.

235
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,034
Jimmy Lee.

236
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,335
Sit.

237
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,774
Do you want your shoes?
No.

238
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:27,246
You're in deep trouble.

239
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,585
But it's okay now.

240
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,625
You and your friends

241
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,195
can go back to Hong Kong.

242
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,396
You're welcome in China as tourists.

243
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,629
But you can't do business here.

244
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,703
Why?

245
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,511
It's our policy.

246
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,853
Mr. Shu is also a gangster.

247
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,718
Why can he do business in China?

248
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,888
We made a deal with him.

249
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,654
And he's a patriot.

250
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,094
I can make you a deal.
I can be a patriot.

251
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,969
What's your rank in Wo Sing Society?

252
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:25,239
Not its Chairman.

253
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,208
If I become the Chairman,

254
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,939
will you let me do business here?

255
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,920
Someone will help you to leave.

256
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,423
Guard.
Yes!

257
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:45,025
It's your decision.

258
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,194
Have a good trip back.

259
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,222
You little punk!

260
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,124
I'll have to find you another school!

261
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,322
Are you Denny Lin's father?

262
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,997
Yes.
This way.

263
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,328
Today
a prefect caught Denny smoking...

264
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,031
...and gambling in the bathroom.

265
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,870
His grades are down.

266
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,910
He's been cutting class.

267
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,342
And we believe...

268
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,506
...Denny's fallen in with a gang.

269
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,211
Mr. Lin, our school
won't tolerate gangster activity.

270
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,014
This is Denny's last chance.

271
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,386
We'll expel him
if his situation doesn't improve.

272
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,358
Talk to your son, Mr. Lin.

273
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:55,728
We're happy to help you
to find another school.

274
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,266
Understood.

275
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,734
Zak.
Yes.

276
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,502
Find out who Denny's friends are.

277
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,440
Yes.

278
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,825
This is Brother Tank.
Thanks.

279
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,195
This is Brother Snake.
Thanks.

280
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,135
This is Brother King.
Thanks.

281
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,240
They will support your candidacy.

282
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,047
Bo.

283
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,180
Welcome.

284
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,314
Jimmy, This is Bo.

285
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,893
He's an old friend of mine.

286
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,552
I won a few cases for him.

287
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:02,826
Turned his murder charge
into manslaughter.

288
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,965
Yeah and I fucking paid for it too!

289
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,130
You did.

290
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,506
Listen, my only love is cash.

291
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,015
I do what you pay me for.

292
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,715
You're my last resort.

293
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,754
I hope I won't need your service.

294
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,948
That's not my business.

295
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:31,221
You have to pay me in full anyway.

296
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:39,294
One penny less, you're dead.

297
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,134
Jimmy said he wouldn't run.

298
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,573
He tricked us.

299
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:54,078
He's a tough one.
It's not looking good.

300
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,350
We'll see about that.

301
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:09,066
Kun, give up running.
Support me for a second term.

302
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:14,104
I'll make you the next Chairman.

303
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,878
How about two Chairmen?

304
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:32,246
We won't have to fight each other.

305
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,593
This second term is not gonna happen.

306
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,479
We'll see about that.

307
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,050
We have to stop Jimmy.

308
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,722
Take care of him first,
we'll talk later.

309
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:01,440
When our brothers were in need,

310
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,309
Jimmy always gave cash
to help them out.

311
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:08,545
Nobody has his kind of money.

312
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:14,147
If money is all that matters,
there's no need for all this.

313
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,692
Don't you agree, Uncle Teng?

314
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,325
He'll harm the Society.

315
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,030
Nothing personal, Jimmy.

316
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,863
But there's a snitch in your group.

317
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,438
If Jimmy becomes the Chairman,

318
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:32,703
everyone's at risk.

319
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:38,544
The police could confiscate
the Dragon Head Baton.

320
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,642
Who's the snitch?

321
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,813
Someone by the name of Lik.

322
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,448
The kid with long hair.

323
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:56,261
He's the reason
our gambling joints were busted.

324
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:01,167
Snake, do you still support Jimmy?

325
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:12,007
My men said Lik was the snitch.

326
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,883
I'll get to the bottom of it.

327
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,218
Good.

328
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:25,728
Take your time. Don't fuck it up.

329
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,353
Wait until the next term to run.

330
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:31,958
Damn cops are everywhere.

331
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:38,201
They're like cockroaches.

332
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:44,679
Now that we're in the spotlight.

333
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:50,777
Jimmy, just take care of the snitch.

334
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,720
If you can't do it yourself,
I'll help you.

335
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,688
No need.

336
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,156
I'll take care of it.

337
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,539
Jimmy.
Brother Bear.

338
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,377
Where's the merchandise?

339
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,905
That's everything.

340
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,721
Wise up in your next life.

341
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,053
Let's go!

342
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,300
"Big Head, I'm leaving you."

343
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:08,003
What? I thought things
were sweet between us.

344
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,109
This way.

345
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,227
I'll talk to Jimmy.

346
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,360
Will he give in?

347
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:37,600
Mr. Kwok is his financier.

348
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,370
Mr. Kwok is his financial muscle.

349
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,911
Be careful.

350
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:49,247
Police are all over this already.

351
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,586
Understood.

352
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,451
Never doubt yourself.

353
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,526
Free your mind from all the worries.

354
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,957
That's how
you achieve enlightenment.

355
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:00,893
I want to go home first.

356
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,794
Don't leave...

357
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,197
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

358
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,133
Wait for me.

359
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,937
I'm leaving.

360
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,879
Then don't ever come back.

361
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,289
Godfather, I'm in charge here.
You can leave first.

362
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,658
Make sure you don't leave any trace.

363
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,162
Yes.

364
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:36,357
I'll accompany you, Godfather.
Stay!

365
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,095
Wah, see Godfather out.
Yes.

366
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,998
Pack him in.
Yes.

367
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,153
Keep an eye on him.

368
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,878
Get in there.

369
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,885
You're not serious?

370
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,325
Phone.

371
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,192
Want me to help you?

372
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,896
No.

373
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,137
Seal it.

374
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,648
Give up running for Chairman,

375
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,915
and your money man is free.

376
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:44,619
Too late.
He'll never trust me again anyway.

377
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,252
Let him go.

378
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,955
I have other backers anyway.

379
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:52,626
You gave up selling porn discs.

380
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,064
You wanted to go clean.

381
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,013
Why run for the election?

382
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,547
2 years ago.

383
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,914
You promised I could do anything
after your term.

384
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,614
Remember?

385
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,821
What's so great
about being a Chairman?

386
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,958
Why can't you let go?

387
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,730
There's no room for negotiation?

388
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,100
No.

389
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,436
It's either you or me.

390
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,042
Prepare to collect Mr. Kwok's body.

391
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,519
I'm ready to play the game.

392
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,214
But if Kwok's dead,

393
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,758
a lot of people
are gonna fall with him.

394
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:35,555
Everyone has a shot
at the Chairman title.

395
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,533
We have to maintain the equilibrium.

396
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,970
That's why I picked you last time.

397
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,733
Tradition is tradition.

398
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,744
Breaking it would cause another war.

399
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,179
It'll be chaos.

400
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,284
Understood.

401
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,888
You should rest more, Uncle Teng.

402
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,616
I'm off.

403
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,491
Learn to let go, Lok.

404
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,428
Everyone is greedy.

405
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:13,127
When I was Chairman,
I wanted a second term.

406
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:17,730
But the Uncles reminded me
to bow out gracefully.

407
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:21,003
When you're old,
people will respect you.

408
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:25,081
Anything else means death.

409
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:30,311
Jimmy will be the next Chairman.

410
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,870
Hide this somewhere in China.

411
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,603
Yes.

412
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:08,844
If I lose,
I'm keeping the Baton and the books.

413
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,618
Who's the target?

414
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,750
Jimmy.

415
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:25,196
He's turning everyone against me.

416
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,902
I've worked for the Society
for so long.

417
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,708
And still no one knows my name.

418
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:45,145
They'll soon know it
when you become Chairman

419
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:12,181
(Mandarin) Sesame oil...

420
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:18,516
(Mandarin) Jellyfish...

421
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,215
(Mandarin) Sesame oil Jellyfish.

422
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:42,002
(Mandarin) Shrimp... Sea Cucumber...

423
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,308
(Mandarin) Shrimp
and Sea Cucumber.

424
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,272
Cheque please.

425
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,844
Yes, Mr. Lee.

426
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,853
Go to the back door
and take a taxi home.

427
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,197
Now!

428
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:56,049
"Jimmy, Uncle Teng
fell down the stairs, he's dead."

429
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,346
Ok.

430
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:21,971
Don't move.

431
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,586
No! Jet!

432
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,625
Don't!

433
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,739
You drive.

434
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,150
Get in.

435
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:55,897
Why don't you kill me?

436
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,509
Fear works better on the living.

437
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:09,176
So what?
You should quit being a hit man.

438
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:16,015
I will, Lok will make me Chairman
after I kill you.

439
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:22,260
I gave everything for the Society.

440
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,765
The Chairman title is mine.

441
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,562
Everyone knows
Lok wants a second term.

442
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,694
You're so naive.

443
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,078
It doesn't matter if you kill me or not.

444
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:56,727
Run!

445
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,437
She's not scared of you.

446
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,717
Get out.

447
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:38,271
If you want,
I'll kill him for an extra charge.

448
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,499
No need.

449
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,339
He's your enemy!

450
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,276
Leave him alone.

451
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,308
Take Mrs. Lee to Yuen Long.
Yes.

452
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,161
Get them inside!

453
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:35,323
Won't be easy
to convince them to betray Lok.

454
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:44,330
Give me the money
and I'll kill Lok for you.

455
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:47,163
They have to do the hit!

456
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:52,668
This way no one can
connect me to his death.

457
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:56,740
These idiots
are willing to die for their boss.

458
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:02,109
Maybe you'll win this after all.

459
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,518
Here.

460
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:42,115
If you help Jimmy,
this money is yours.

461
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,742
Screw you!

462
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:07,042
Take him back.

463
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,784
What are you playing for?

464
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,651
$10,000 a game.

465
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,930
$10,000.

466
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,268
Will you help Jimmy?

467
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,386
Will you help Jimmy?

468
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,594
Will you help Jimmy?

469
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,364
Will you help Jimmy?

470
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,008
Next.

471
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,045
Wait.

472
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,227
Damn!

473
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:56,325
Damn! I want more money!

474
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:04,632
This will give me nightmares!

475
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:23,718
Thank you all.

476
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:41,032
They said Lok
came to this funeral home 2 nights ago.

477
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,623
Ok.

478
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,988
Move.

479
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,736
Seal off the road.

480
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:22,114
Kun is coming.

481
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,616
Move fast.

482
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,814
Stop!

483
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,818
Turn around.

484
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,034
Seal off the road.
Yes.

485
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:17,162
Cover here.
Yes.

486
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:02,382
Kun is coming.

487
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,145
We should leave.

488
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,002
Let's go back.

489
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,101
Kill him!

490
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,610
Go!

491
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,758
Mr. Kwok.

492
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,660
Mr. Kwok...

493
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,710
Mr. Kwok.

494
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,782
We're here, help!

495
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,379
Wai!

496
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,295
Stop!

497
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,172
I'll call you back.

498
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:15,212
Brother Lok, Kun is in trouble.

499
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,548
Should we go help?

500
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:16,401
More money...

501
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,911
This job will cost you more money.

502
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,931
Get in!

503
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:04,489
Stop!

504
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,458
Police! Freeze!

505
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,722
Sir, are you okay?

506
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,493
I have nothing to do with it!

507
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:14,899
Kun is the mastermind!

508
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,561
Get me out of here!

509
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:31,510
Boss.
Sit.

510
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,246
Sit.

511
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:36,652
We're the biggest gang in the area.

512
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,693
Join us
and no one will dare touch you.

513
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,523
You'll get all the girls.

514
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:45,156
Without us you'll get no protection.

515
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,395
Bring your money?
Yes.

516
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:05,983
Denny.

517
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:11,951
Who the hell are you?

518
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,456
Let's go home.

519
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:15,893
I'm a gangster.

520
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:24,529
Denny!

521
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,771
Denny!

522
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:09,269
He's scared.

523
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:12,704
Take him home.

524
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,968
Long Gun...

525
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:31,522
Is everyone here? Sit.

526
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:46,933
The result is obvious.
Kun has left Hong Kong.

527
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:50,010
Another possibility is Jet.

528
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:53,273
Who? Never heard of him.

529
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:55,440
Let's get this over with.

530
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,313
Hold it.

531
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:02,651
There's one thing I need to ask.

532
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,219
Jimmy!

533
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:13,196
Do you swear you didn't kill Lok?

534
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,297
Take an oath.

535
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,308
I didn't do it.

536
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:44,129
I'm voting for Jimmy.

537
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:19,829
Some of you don't like me.

538
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,102
I'm fine with that.

539
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:28,335
My term will be up in 2 years.

540
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:29,428
Turn the car around.

541
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,225
Jet!

542
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:55,412
A lot of people want you dead.

543
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:04,560
This is no way to live.

544
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:28,715
Call me if you need anything.
Stop the car.

545
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:20,166
We welcome your investment
in China.

546
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:22,572
I wish you prosperous business.

547
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,440
Thank you.

548
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:30,510
Your arrest
was all a misunderstanding.

549
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:35,886
Construction of your logistic center
has been approved.

550
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:40,188
The local authority
will begin building the highway here.

551
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:44,832
You own this land now.

552
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,399
Thank you.

553
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:50,464
Your estate up there
has also been approved.

554
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:18,854
Here is the Baton.

555
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:21,852
How did you find it?

556
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:26,661
On October 28th,

557
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:29,861
Lok's man...

558
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:33,634
...arrived in Guangzhou with it.

559
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:35,606
2 days later.

560
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,338
He brought the Baton
to Guangzhou, China,

561
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,573
and hid it in his ancestral home.

562
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:43,115
When you won the election,

563
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:48,052
we arrested him and got it back.

564
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:52,293
I'm deeply impressed,

565
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:57,691
but your power also frightens me.

566
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:03,234
What exactly are you getting at?

567
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:15,013
We have another request.

568
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:19,075
From this day on,
the Baton will stay in your family.

569
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,245
What do you mean?

570
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,560
We respect the election system.

571
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:29,288
But when your term is up,

572
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,662
we don't want any little punks...

573
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,269
...like your Godfather

574
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,894
upsetting the social order.

575
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:44,808
You want to turn Wo Sing
into a family enterprise?

576
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:46,436
Will my son inherit the Baton?

577
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,640
We can trust you.

578
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:51,343
Your family will own Wo Sing.

579
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:54,148
You and I will work hand in hand.

580
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:57,690
No! My term expires in 2 years!

581
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,657
I'm just a businessman!

582
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:00,726
I don't want to be a gangster!

583
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,194
I don't want to be a gangster!

584
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:04,956
Forget about the logistic centre!

585
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,228
Forget about my business in China!

586
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:17,167
You can't change the tradition.

587
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:20,748
The Uncles will never agree!

588
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:28,614
My son is supposed to be a lawyer!

589
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:30,519
My son is supposed to be a doctor!

590
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:32,956
You set me up!
Freeze!

591
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:48,066
Your leadership...

592
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,404
...will make Hong Kong a safer place.

593
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:52,740
Screw you!

594
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:56,143
Hong Kong can only prosper.

595
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:58,582
Screw you!

596
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:05,221
We need your cooperation.

597
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,624
We need your help.

598
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:13,562
Screw you!

599
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:38,916
Thank you.

600
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,853
Thanks for your cooperation.

601
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:05,171
I'm pregnant.

602
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:22,849
Give me a minute.

604
01:29:23,305 --> 01:30:23,438
