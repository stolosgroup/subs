3
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,902
Hello, Three?
All clear. Bring it in.

4
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,623
Brigade.

5
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,860
Once more unto the breach.

6
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,129
Yes, chef.

7
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,712
Where the fuck am I?

8
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,413
- Look, it's Diana.
- Excuse me.

9
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,883
I'm looking for somewhere.

10
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,052
I've absolutely no idea where I
am.

11
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,461
There are no signs anywhere.

12
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:45,399
Where am I?

13
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,051
Right.

14
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,291
"Half my weight's in jewellery,
anyway."

15
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:50,030
Do you remember when she said
that?

16
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:52,900
I wasn't here,
but I heard about it.

17
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,835
Is she here yet?

18
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,038
Not yet, Ma'am, no.

19
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,973
Then she's late.

20
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:04,211
And he is early.

21
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,885
And yet she is late.

22
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,156
Well, well,
well.

23
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,663
Excuse me!

24
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,248
What the bloody hell
are you doing here, Diana?

25
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,452
Sorry, I mean... Your Royal
Highness.

26
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,155
I'm lost.

27
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,961
But if it's you,
I must be close, yes?

28
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,330
Yeah, the house is just there
but...

29
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,499
why are you driving yourself?

30
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,335
Well, cars don't drive on their
own.

31
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:10,638
No.

32
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,475
Where's your driver?
Where's your security detail?

33
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,243
I don't know

34
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,446
I was in the café in Kensington
giving some presents and...

35
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,515
I thought I might
just...

36
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:23,217
drive.

37
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,486
Do they know?

38
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,020
No.

39
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,523
I just drove.

40
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,427
Well, anyway.

41
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,229
Hello again.

42
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:37,699
Hello, Darren.

43
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,301
Is everybody there?

44
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:44,137
Well,
apart from Her Majesty, yeah.

45
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,640
Perfect.

46
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,545
Look.

47
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,146
Of course.

48
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,115
Now I know where I am.

49
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:58,218
We used to call him Bertie.

50
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,189
I think that's my father's coat
he's wearing.

51
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,159
We used to live
just over that hill.

52
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:09,062
Papa used to give the farmer
his old clothes.

53
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:18,539
Gosh, how could I get lost in a
place where I used to play?

54
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,608
We should really get going.

55
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,445
Will they kill me, do you think?

56
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,215
I'm going to check.

57
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,550
Check what?

58
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,085
Look, it's sandwiches
in 15 minutes.

59
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,754
- It's Papa's, I'm sure of it.
- Wait.

60
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:37,190
Say there was a big tractor
broken down or something, eh?

61
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,358
Say you got lost.

62
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,426
Anything.

63
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,529
It's too late for trying
broken tractors on them.

64
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,752
Her Majesty.

65
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,222
Your Royal Highness.

66
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,399
Hello.

67
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:36,737
No.

68
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,940
Gary usually lets me off.

69
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,374
Gary, Your Royal Highness?

70
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,444
The normal page.
The usual Christmas page.

71
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,647
We have a thing between us,
an understanding.

72
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:49,483
I don't usually do
the getting-weighed thing.

73
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,351
I'm half jewellery, anyway.

74
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,786
That's what I always say.

75
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,857
I'm not, though.

76
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,325
- It's a joke.
- Ma'am.

77
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,896
Her Majesty herself just a
second ago sat on these scales.

78
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,532
And she was very
insistent that everyone joins in.

79
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,003
- I don't think I've seen you before.
- This is my first Sandringham duty.

80
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,538
To make sure everyone joins in.

81
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:14,942
They said no one is above
tradition.

82
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:18,311
Okay, fine.

83
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:19,847
I'm in enough trouble.

84
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,323
We have to put on three
pounds minimum before we leave

85
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,860
to prove we enjoyed Christmas,
yes?

86
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,962
That is the tradition.

87
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:39,332
It was Prince Albert in 1847
who began it.

88
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,838
- It's meant to be a bit of fun.
- Well, it is, it's a lovely bit of fun.

89
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,674
I'll do what I can.
But no promises.

90
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,509
I'm always catching up,
always.

91
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:54,582
- They're all here, aren't they?
- Yes.

92
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:57,751
Mm.

93
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:00,621
What happened?

94
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,089
A tractor broken down.

95
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:05,325
I had to help mend it. My fingernails.

96
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:09,931
- Is the bedroom cold again this year?
- Yes, it is.

97
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:13,034
I always tell them.
They never listen.

98
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,770
- Ma'am, if the bedroom's cold...
- The bedroom's always cold.

99
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,973
It's a bit of fun.
Tradition.

100
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,075
I will have more blankets
delivered.

101
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,543
Why don't they just
turn up the heating

102
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,545
instead of burying everyone
in blankets?

103
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,682
- It's every year I say it.
- Mummy?

104
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:30,618
What?
Oh, look at you!

105
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,419
-Mummy, I'm cold.

106
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,056
Who gave you this
big, hilarious coat?

107
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,756
It's from the storeroom, Ma'am.

108
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,526
His Royal Highness
kept saying he was cold.

109
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,895
Instead of heating...

110
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:44,599
they've dressed you up
like Winston Churchill.

111
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:48,035
Your Royal Highness.

112
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:51,471
The family are all gathered in the
drawing room for the sandwiches.

113
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,640
They are waiting.

114
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,677
The sandwiches.

115
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,047
The sandwiches. The holy
sandwiches.

116
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,382
Good.

117
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,619
To the sandwiches.

118
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,054
I'll be there in a minute.

119
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:09,556
Ma'am.

120
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:25,066
Three days.

121
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,002
That's it.

122
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,248
Maggie.

123
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,954
Oh my God.
Didn't they tell you?

124
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:50,958
I've got you again.
I bagged you.

125
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,627
They gave me to you
because I insisted.

126
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:55,663
Good.

127
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:57,598
Hope.

128
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,770
These are your dresses
for the whole thing.

129
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,143
I have to run.
Listen...

130
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,579
I've left a coat in my car.

131
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,015
I want you to clean it, sew it
up,

132
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:15,249
whatever it needs.

133
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,718
A coat from where, Ma'am?

134
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,554
Ancient history.

135
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:22,857
Whose ancient history?

136
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,692
Spencer.

137
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:41,909
I was always last back.

138
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:43,777
Always late for everything.

139
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:48,115
I'd get home half an hour
after the others and...

140
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:49,716
everyone would just laugh.

141
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,321
I'd actually forgotten all
about the scarecrow until today.

142
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:57,124
I can't believe
he's still watching over us.

143
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:00,727
How can he watch us?

144
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:05,833
Ma'am,
they're about to open the presents.

145
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:07,034
Yes, coming.

146
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:09,937
Mummy,

147
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,808
why do we have to open our
presents on Christmas Eve?

148
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:16,944
Why not Christmas Day
like everybody else?

149
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,747
- You know at school you do tenses?
- Yeah.

150
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,217
There's the past, the present,
future.

151
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,318
Right.

152
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,987
Well here,
there is only one tense.

153
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,156
There is no future.

154
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,126
The past and the present
are the same thing.

155
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,029
Daddy told Harry
it's because Father Christmas

156
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,965
does queens and kings
the day before everybody else

157
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,034
so that we get the best
presents.

158
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,036
- It's true.
- He still believes it.

159
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,270
What?

160
00:21:43,304 --> 00:21:45,306
Actually, that was
my little fabrication.

161
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:46,941
I believe Mummy.

162
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,643
Daddy did confirm it,
though.

163
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:51,846
Oh, if Daddy confirmed it,
then it must be true.

164
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,347
Yes, of course it is.

165
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:56,217
You two are both gonna
get coal for Christmas.

166
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,987
Can we go to the house
where you used to live?

167
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,155
It's boarded up.

168
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,891
It's dangerous, apparently.

169
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:06,260
They said,
"It's dangerous, you know?"

170
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,230
- Aww.
- In those voices, like doors closing.

171
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:11,065
Did Granny order that?

172
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:14,802
Ma'am, the others are
waiting.

173
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,171
Okay, you go.
I'll join you in a minute. Come on.

174
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:21,876
Do you like them
getting cross with you?

175
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,177
Yes, terribly.

176
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:25,179
Mummy,

177
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:26,347
what's happened?

178
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,748
It's Christmas.

179
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,717
Everything waits until after
Christmas.

180
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,086
Go on.

181
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,899
Fuck.

182
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:11,425
There.

183
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:28,708
What do you think?

184
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,212
Very beautiful, Your Royal
Highness.

185
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:32,745
Mm.

186
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:39,786
- It's Martha, isn't it?
- Maria, Ma'am.

187
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,854
Oh.

188
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:45,159
My husband doesn't know it,
but...

189
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,095
I saw a photo and...

190
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:50,898
she was wearing
exactly the same pearls.

191
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,468
He bought exactly the same for
her.

192
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:57,271
But he doesn't even realise.

193
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:01,976
It's why I left them.

194
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,143
As a gesture.

195
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:08,282
They are beautiful.

196
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,087
It's not the pearls' fault, is
it?

197
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,989
No, Ma'am.

198
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,159
If I gave them to you,
would you take them?

199
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:24,832
No.

200
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,534
No, she couldn't possibly
think of it, Ma'am.

201
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:31,005
I'm told there's a dress
to go with them.

202
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:32,406
I'm told it's all set.

203
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,875
You know? All set.

204
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,545
As if everything's already
happened.

205
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:44,211
Papa, didn't you say that we Spencers
were distantly related to Anne Boleyn?

206
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,582
Yes, I read all about her.

207
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,551
They even wrote a poem.

208
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,022
"She married the King of England

209
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:57,391
"And the King chopped off her
head

210
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,427
"Because he met another woman

211
00:26:01,596 --> 00:26:03,263
"And wanted her to be Queen...

212
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,100
"instead."

213
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,337
Who is it?

214
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:44,972
It's Maggie, Ma'am.

215
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,908
Well, come.

216
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:50,444
Emergency.

217
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:56,183
Gosh, thank God it's you.

218
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:57,985
Look.

219
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,687
Emergency, why? It looks
beautiful.

220
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:02,990
- But it doesn't fit.
- Have you tried it on?

221
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,391
No, with my mood.

222
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:06,527
It... It doesn't fit in with my
mood.

223
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,564
Should be black.
Black, to contrast the pearls.

224
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:20,107
Not only did I
rescue it from a scarecrow,

225
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:22,242
I'm talking to it.

226
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:25,647
All rumours
of my disintegration confirmed.

227
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,654
You know, the dust in this
house...

228
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:36,957
almost certainly contains the dead skin
of every person who's ever stayed in it.

229
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:39,694
This was once Queen Victoria's
room.

230
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,963
So it will have her skin
floating in the air.

231
00:27:44,632 --> 00:27:47,234
She wore black for forty years
after her husband died.

232
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:50,304
That's love, isn't it?

233
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:53,474
Well, there's no need to wear
black because no one has died.

234
00:27:57,645 --> 00:28:00,013
- I've put on weight.
- No, you've lost weight.

235
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:02,684
There's up or down.
It's not an issue of debate.

236
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,718
Remember, we used to talk.

237
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,622
They fill your eggs with princes
and ride away.

238
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:10,123
That's fine.

239
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:11,725
It's just fine.

240
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,193
Oh, fuck it.

241
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:16,029
I will wear the dress.

242
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:18,098
With the pearls.

243
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,199
Good.

244
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,001
Good choice.

245
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,370
Because I'm too weak
to insist on black.

246
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:24,505
Please.

247
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:27,140
- It will be fine.
- Yes, it <i>will</i> be fine.

248
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:29,343
Good.

249
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:32,412
You'll be in the world,
in some pub. Laughing.

250
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:36,149
And I will be in a field
full of fucking landmines.

251
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,520
So stand very still and smile a
lot.

252
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:42,422
In this house,
everyone can hear everything.

253
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,659
Yes, even your
thoughts.

254
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:46,093
Who is that new chap?

255
00:28:46,694 --> 00:28:48,328
He can read your thoughts.

256
00:28:48,362 --> 00:28:50,832
Yes,
they're getting quite serious.

257
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:54,334
- About?
- They're getting serious about you.

258
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,104
It is concern.

259
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,072
Yes, concern.

260
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:01,475
Suggesting
compassion.

261
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,211
Why wouldn't they be concerned?

262
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:06,146
I'm half gone.

263
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:08,315
- Gone where?
- I don't know.

264
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,119
Today, I nearly just...

265
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:14,589
nearly just kept driving.

266
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:20,527
This year they insisted on weighing me.

267
00:29:23,698 --> 00:29:25,299
Just a bit of fun.

268
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,501
They can't change.

269
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,503
You have to change.

270
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:34,074
I mean, the
weighing, yes, that is just that.

271
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:35,810
A bit of fun.

272
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:38,846
But don't see conspiracy everywhere.

273
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,683
Don't behave the way
the say you behave.

274
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:43,818
You make it easy for
them.

275
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:46,420
Easy for them to do
what?

276
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,221
Well, say it.

277
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:50,290
Just look gorgeous.

278
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,560
I know about the pearls.
I know he gave the same to her.

279
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,296
I understand
why you're like this.

280
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,669
- It's deliberate.
- No, no.

281
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:03,303
He just forgets.

282
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:05,238
But wear them anyway.

283
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,610
And in your beauty,
he will remember.

284
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:11,311
I don't care
if he fucking remembers.

285
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:14,381
Then only remember
you're beautiful.

286
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:16,717
Don't let that go.

287
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:18,653
Beauty is useless.

288
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,689
Beauty is clothing.

289
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:33,533
Prepare the tureens, warm the bowls.
Please. Hush, hush, no noise.

290
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:36,671
Stay on on your feet!

291
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:38,305
They can hear us.

292
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:40,707
Pitter, patter, soft words.

293
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:45,379
Fingers out of saucers,
you sons and you daughters of bitches.

294
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:48,916
And we blanch the nettles
or they will sting us.

295
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:55,923
Brigade, we make everything
the best it can be.

296
00:30:55,957 --> 00:30:58,826
I want our Princess of Wales

297
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:01,663
to want something.

298
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,364
Service.

299
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,015
Ma'am?

300
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:22,749
It's dessert.

301
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,785
- They're waiting for you.
- Yes, I know.

302
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:48,869
Still hungry,
Ma'am?

303
00:37:59,814 --> 00:38:01,082
Who are you...

304
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:02,817
exactly?

305
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:06,654
I'm usually at Clarence House,
drafted in for this occasion.

306
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:08,656
I'm the Queen Mother's equerry.

307
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:12,960
Before that?

308
00:38:14,428 --> 00:38:17,198
I was an officer.
In a regiment called the Black Watch.

309
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:19,900
And that's what you do.

310
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:21,335
You watch.

311
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,139
Mostly I'm here because of the
press.

312
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:30,311
It was felt we needed to be on guard
because of all the silly attention

313
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:32,880
that your Royal Highness is
attracting.

314
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:34,381
Yes, I'm a magnet for madness.

315
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,284
Other people's madness.

316
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:39,887
I have military experience.

317
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,791
Part of my remit is the security within
the grounds of Sandringham House.

318
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:47,094
To keep photographers away.

319
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:49,230
Foreigners, you know?

320
00:38:51,198 --> 00:38:53,400
One of the men reported
back today that they saw you

321
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:56,003
dressing and undressing
with your curtains open.

322
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:59,974
If there
had been a photographer...

323
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:03,677
Now you really watch.

324
00:39:04,478 --> 00:39:07,314
I watch to make sure
that others do not see.

325
00:39:08,748 --> 00:39:11,751
Their lenses are terribly
powerful these days, Ma'am.

326
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,688
Their lenses are more like
microscopes, actually.

327
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:18,893
And I am the insect in the dish.

328
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:23,330
You see, they're pulling
my wings and my legs off.

329
00:39:24,398 --> 00:39:27,334
One by one.
Making notes on how I react.

330
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:32,772
"Oh, she really does make
a fuss this one, doesn't she?"

331
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:35,976
Not like Anne Boleyn...

332
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:41,348
who offered her head to the
tweezers with such grace.

333
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:46,854
I just wanted to be sure
you were feeling all right.

334
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:50,024
And give you that word of
warning.

335
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,426
I will feel all right.

336
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,896
If you go away.
Please.

337
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:57,464
Very well.

338
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,732
But please...

339
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:02,403
- keep your curtains...
- Close my curtains.

340
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:04,305
Yes.

341
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:07,474
Maybe.

342
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:09,910
No.

343
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:13,881
Depending on lots of things.
Hmm.

344
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:20,487
Oh.

345
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:22,957
It's gone midnight.

346
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,791
So...

347
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:27,161
Happy Christmas.

348
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:29,029
Happy Christmas.

349
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,172
Who is this?

350
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:46,974
Hands on your head!

351
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:49,176
Sorry.

352
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:50,210
It's me.

353
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:54,582
Your Royal Highness, apologies.

354
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:56,183
We thought you were...

355
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:58,552
Can I take my hands off
my head?

356
00:41:59,153 --> 00:42:01,422
Of course. Sorry, Ma'am.

357
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:02,890
I used to live there.

358
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,558
I grew up there.

359
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:07,161
Came to have a look.

360
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:11,398
Ma'am, according to the rules, if we
have an encounter, we have to report it.

361
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:13,133
With me?

362
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:14,636
With anyone.

363
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:18,105
I'd like it if you didn't
report this encounter.

364
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,274
Just...

365
00:42:20,642 --> 00:42:22,209
say you saw a ghost.

366
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,346
Are you warm enough,
Ma'am?

367
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:27,114
Not really.

368
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:29,917
They won't turn the heating up.

369
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,155
- I'll go back.
- We'll escort you.

370
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:38,058
- Why?
- There are photographers.

371
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:41,929
Well, perhaps they just want to
take photos of what's really going on.

372
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:44,431
<i>2323,
anyone there?</i>

373
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,066
<i>Joe, is anyone there?</i>

374
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,235
No, nothing at all.

375
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:50,070
No one, all clear.

376
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:30,043
Mummy, you're freezing.

377
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:33,480
I tried to escape.

378
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:34,682
Got captured.

379
00:43:38,552 --> 00:43:39,953
This one's for you.

380
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,291
- What is it?
- Not telling you.

381
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:48,162
Open it in the morning.
Christmas morning, like normal people.

382
00:43:48,596 --> 00:43:50,598
Don't tell anyone.

383
00:43:50,632 --> 00:43:54,034
- Okay.
- I can hear you both talking, you know?

384
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:57,704
- And I'm still cold.
- Oh.

385
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,274
When you're cold,

386
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:01,708
you light a fire.

387
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:06,113
For you.

388
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:10,717
Let's play. Come on.

389
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:12,719
Attention.

390
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:17,090
I'll be the major.
You be the soldiers.

391
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,460
This game is silly.

392
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:21,629
Because you're hopeless at it.

393
00:44:21,663 --> 00:44:22,529
Soldier William.

394
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:27,034
Best thing
about Christmas so far?

395
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:30,070
- Best thing...
- And it has to be the truth.

396
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:33,641
Best thing about Christmas so far
is being with the family, Sir.

397
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:38,145
Soldier,
I said I wanted the truth.

398
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,713
- Soldier.
- Sorry, Sir.

399
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:41,548
Presents, Sir.

400
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:44,518
Sir, presents are the only good
thing about Christmas, Sir.

401
00:44:45,854 --> 00:44:48,188
- Not if you can't open them.
- That's true.

402
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:52,326
Soldier Harry.
Best part of Christmas so far?

403
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:55,028
And I know I'll get
the truth from you, Sir.

404
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,498
When you arrived, Mummy, Sir.

405
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,401
- Thank you, Sir.
- My turn.

406
00:45:01,836 --> 00:45:04,037
Major William to Soldier Diana.

407
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:06,473
Tell the Major what's happened
to make you so sad.

408
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:09,243
Sir.
Don't know what you mean, Sir.

409
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,379
I want the truth, Soldier.

410
00:45:12,412 --> 00:45:13,480
Sir.

411
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:15,382
The past, Sir.

412
00:45:16,116 --> 00:45:18,051
I think it's the
present, Soldier.

413
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:22,089
I think it's in the future.

414
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,161
Mummy, I actually have to
open this or I'll be sick.

415
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:30,397
For God's sake, then
open it.

416
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:35,469
Major William
to Soldier Diana.

417
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:38,438
Um... What's your favourite
colour?

418
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:40,407
- What... What's your favourite...
- Sir, pink.

419
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,209
No, um...
Favourite food?

420
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:46,513
Um... Pink, pink...
um... hippopotamus cake, spotted.

421
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:49,550
- What's your favourite animal, Soldier?
- Oh...

422
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:51,418
Lobster.

423
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,155
- Lobster.
- Why did you get me a lobster?

424
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:59,192
Um... Because it's red
like your cheeks, Sir.

425
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:03,598
And it was flown
from... um...

426
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:06,400
It was flown from
Santa's home all the way...

427
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:07,602
Um...

428
00:46:07,635 --> 00:46:10,137
It's...
it's Santa's... lobster.

429
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,705
It's Santa's lobster, Sir.

430
00:46:12,472 --> 00:46:13,808
I wanted the truth!

431
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:17,544
It's all the way from
the North Pole. She flew here.

432
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:20,414
- You have wings?
- Definitely.

433
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:23,150
- Soldier William.
- Ah.

434
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:25,485
Your perfect, perfect Christmas.

435
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:27,220
Tell me all about it.

436
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:29,489
My perfect, perfect Christmas,
Sir,

437
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:32,694
is not following the rules
and doing whatever you want.

438
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:35,762
- Eating with your hands.
- Not showing up.

439
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:38,332
What would that be
like?

440
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:39,667
That would be a miracle.

441
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:43,337
We've never had
a miracle before.

442
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,372
Don't know what it's like.

443
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,742
Soldier.
Do you want to be king, Soldier?

444
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:53,413
I have no choice.

445
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:57,784
Do you want to be the queen,
Soldier?

446
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:00,588
I'll be your mum.

447
00:47:01,521 --> 00:47:02,657
That's my job.

448
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,826
Do you get paid?

449
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,561
Hardly.

450
00:47:08,696 --> 00:47:11,164
If I start being really silly
in the next few days,

451
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,266
just tell me.

452
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:16,671
I'll only believe it
if it's you who tells me.

453
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:18,271
Okay, Mummy.

454
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:19,573
Sure can do.

455
00:47:52,674 --> 00:47:53,608
Who is it?

456
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:55,910
Your dresser,
Your Royal Highness.

457
00:48:07,622 --> 00:48:08,890
Where's Maggie?

458
00:48:09,356 --> 00:48:11,224
I have dressed you before,
Ma'am.

459
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:12,359
Yes, I know.

460
00:48:12,593 --> 00:48:13,760
May I come in?

461
00:48:14,494 --> 00:48:15,729
Where's Maggie?

462
00:48:16,496 --> 00:48:19,399
I believe Major Gregory
sent her back to London.

463
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:35,983
It's very cold this morning.

464
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,865
This is for breakfast.

465
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:55,368
The next outfit,
the one you chose for church...

466
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:58,538
I suggest you wear
a warm Merino long coat.

467
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,009
How do I look?

468
00:49:03,376 --> 00:49:04,612
What do you mean?

469
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:07,481
Right now, how do
I look?

470
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:09,282
Very nice.

471
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,551
Hmm.

472
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:15,690
- Happy Christmas.
- Oh!

473
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:19,359
- Happy Christmas...
- "...Christmas, Ma'am." "Very nice."

474
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,896
I'd really like to have someone
I can talk to properly.

475
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:23,330
When is Maggie back?

476
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:25,799
- I really don't know, Ma'am.
- That will be all. Thank you.

477
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:27,101
I'm sorry?

478
00:49:27,135 --> 00:49:29,536
There's a designated dress which
I will put on for breakfast.

479
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:31,005
And I can put it on
myself.

480
00:49:31,873 --> 00:49:33,608
Your hair isn't set, Ma'am.

481
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:38,745
Tell them I want Maggie.

482
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,416
Tell Major Gregory, who hears everything,
that I insist on having Maggie.

483
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:47,622
It isn't really Major Gregory
who decides.

484
00:49:47,955 --> 00:49:50,490
No, he doesn't decide.
There's never a decision to make.

485
00:49:50,524 --> 00:49:52,325
There's only what must happen.

486
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,493
But even so...

487
00:49:54,996 --> 00:49:57,397
Tell them I insist
on having Maggie.

488
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:07,541
Or I'll cut all my dresses
to pieces with a kitchen knife.

489
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:12,712
Yes, Ma'am.

490
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:16,050
Wait, don't say that.

491
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,551
No, I don't mean that.

492
00:50:17,919 --> 00:50:19,020
Don't say that.

493
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:21,354
Just say that I'd like Maggie.

494
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:24,491
Though you're good,

495
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:26,694
I would prefer...

496
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:28,762
I would like Maggie.

497
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:31,699
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Thank you.

498
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:15,643
Your Majesties,
Your Royal Highnesses, smile, please.

499
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:25,719
This will be followed
by coddled eggs with cream sauce,

500
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:28,022
Scottish kippers, brown and
white toast.

501
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:30,691
Accompanied by simmered herring
roe,

502
00:51:30,724 --> 00:51:34,128
roasted muffins, quince jelly.
Followed by fresh...

503
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:35,762
This will be
followed by fresh coffee

504
00:51:35,997 --> 00:51:38,933
with a selection of
organic pastries and cakes

505
00:51:38,966 --> 00:51:40,268
from Highgrove House,

506
00:51:40,301 --> 00:51:44,105
a selection of organic Highgrove
jams and marmalades with honey

507
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:46,040
from Highgrove bees.

508
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,476
Then,
at ten o'clock precisely,

509
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:51,612
cars will take all those
concerned

510
00:51:51,646 --> 00:51:54,882
to St. Mary Magdalene's Church
for traditional morning worship.

511
00:51:55,749 --> 00:51:56,951
But now,

512
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:59,954
enjoy your breakfast, your
Majesty.

513
00:52:06,027 --> 00:52:07,128
How do I look?

514
00:52:10,131 --> 00:52:11,498
You look fine.

515
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:17,605
There is... one thing.

516
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:23,476
The chickens laid
the eggs,

517
00:52:24,278 --> 00:52:26,080
the fishermen caught the fish,

518
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:29,917
all these little bees made the
honey...

519
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,955
They all made such an
effort to bring you breakfast.

520
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:35,856
Please,

521
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:39,193
do them the courtesy
of not regurgitating it all

522
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:42,729
into a lavatory bowl before
the church bells even ring.

523
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:52,873
The peace of God,
which passeth all understanding,

524
00:52:53,207 --> 00:52:56,944
shall keep your hearts and minds
in the knowledge and love of God

525
00:52:57,144 --> 00:52:59,947
and of his Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord.

526
00:53:00,848 --> 00:53:05,152
And the blessings of God almighty,
the Father, the Son and Holy Ghost

527
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,589
be amongst you
and remain with you always.

528
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:10,992
- Amen.
- Amen.

529
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:36,217
Come here.

530
00:53:37,985 --> 00:53:39,186
Thanks for the crab.

531
00:53:39,954 --> 00:53:41,889
It's awful.

532
00:53:42,656 --> 00:53:44,125
I got it at the petrol station.

533
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:45,926
It's Christmas.

534
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,662
It's the thought that counts.

535
00:53:59,106 --> 00:54:01,242
Did you tell anyone? Mm?

536
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:02,977
No.

537
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:05,312
I told Harry to hide his lobster.

538
00:54:05,346 --> 00:54:06,746
But he lost it anyway.

539
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:08,715
Of course.

540
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:10,251
Well, that's okay.

541
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:13,154
There's lots of crustaceans to
be had at the petrol station.

542
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:14,788
- Mm?
- Yeah.

543
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,729
- You cold?
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,266
- Yeah.
- Almost.

545
00:54:29,403 --> 00:54:31,272
Diana!

546
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:32,239
Diana!

547
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:36,210
Look this way.
Give us a smile.

548
00:54:36,243 --> 00:54:37,978
And William!
Will!

549
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:51,692
Look this way.
There she is.

550
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:13,647
Diana!

551
00:55:15,249 --> 00:55:17,418
<i>The public began
arriving early this morning...</i>

552
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:19,687
Look,
she's wearing the wrong one.

553
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:23,324
She's wearing "Boxing Day lunch" when
it should be "Christmas Day church."

554
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:27,061
Does it really matter that
she's, um, swapping them around?

555
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:28,028
<i>And those crowds...</i>

556
00:55:28,062 --> 00:55:30,131
I mean, do you think
I should tell someone?

557
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:32,233
They might think
it's me making mistakes.

558
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:35,169
Oh, no. Oh, don't worry.

559
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:37,671
<i>...as the Royal
Family turned out...</i>

560
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:40,707
They'll know it's not you
who's making mistakes.

561
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,076
<i>...the Duke of
Edinburgh.</i>

562
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:44,945
"Oh death rock me to sleep

563
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,882
"Bring me to quiet rest

564
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:51,418
"Let pass my weary, guiltless
ghost

565
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:54,355
"Out of my careful breast."

566
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:02,296
Diana.

567
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,035
Oh death, rock me to sleep.

568
00:56:38,432 --> 00:56:39,700
Pull!

569
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:47,841
Pull!

570
00:57:02,223 --> 00:57:03,824
You have to say "Pull."

571
00:57:04,191 --> 00:57:06,759
- Pull.
- Don't whisper it, say it loud.

572
00:57:07,494 --> 00:57:08,495
Pull!

573
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:14,902
Again.

574
00:57:15,836 --> 00:57:16,870
Pull!

575
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:27,414
You've got... You've got 24 hours.
Just teach him.

576
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:29,782
You move with the bird,
you aim for the beak.

577
00:57:29,817 --> 00:57:31,051
Okay.

578
00:57:31,518 --> 00:57:33,753
One in three would be bearable.

579
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:39,827
William told me before we came
here he didn't want to shoot guns.

580
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,529
I want to talk because someone
aid something about clothes.

581
00:57:42,563 --> 00:57:44,265
- Will he be all right?
- Yes, of course he'll be alright.

582
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:46,500
Your dresser said something
about clothes.

583
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:48,068
I mean, will he be safe?

584
00:57:48,102 --> 00:57:50,537
It's perfectly safe,
you wear protective glasses.

585
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:53,540
How can it be safe

586
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:55,843
if you have to wear protective
glasses?

587
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:59,179
Yesterday,
you arrived after the Queen.

588
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:01,849
- I got lost.
- How could you get lost?

589
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:03,517
You've lived over the hill for
years.

590
00:58:04,218 --> 00:58:05,486
It looks different now.

591
00:58:06,287 --> 00:58:07,888
Everything looks different.

592
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:10,457
Except the scarecrow.

593
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:13,427
Yes, she says you took a
jacket off a scarecrow.

594
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:16,363
It was a bit of fun.

595
00:58:17,931 --> 00:58:20,567
You sure you weren't late yesterday
because you were delayed by someone?

596
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:23,070
Someone?

597
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,172
I just thought
someone might have delayed you.

598
00:58:26,373 --> 00:58:27,541
No.

599
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:32,279
Sometimes you get delayed
by someone.

600
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:34,815
No one says anything.

601
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,285
It's perfectly acceptable for
you to be delayed by someone.

602
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,154
How can you ask if it's safe?
It's a tradition.

603
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,056
Why did you send Maggie away?

604
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:44,224
They said
she left the curtains open.

605
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:45,492
I left the curtains open.

606
00:58:46,628 --> 00:58:49,363
They are circling us.
Didn't you know? Don't you read?

607
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:52,433
They're hungry for anything.
Why are you swapping dresses around?

608
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:56,470
Why would you think
I got delayed by someone?

609
00:58:56,503 --> 00:58:58,072
Oh, come on, come on.

610
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:05,112
- He said he didn't want to shoot yet.
- He's old enough.

611
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,549
And you want him
to shoot real birds tomorrow?

612
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,184
For God's sake.

613
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,088
Also...

614
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:17,224
one of Major Gregory's men
said he saw you

615
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:20,094
wandering around
in the grounds last night.

616
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:23,063
I wanted to see my house.

617
00:59:23,097 --> 00:59:25,899
The police caught you
but didn't report it.

618
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:27,034
Gregory's men saw you too.

619
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:29,503
- They're better than the police.
- I wanted to go home.

620
00:59:29,536 --> 00:59:33,307
- It's boarded up.
- Yes, but I wish it would be unboarded.

621
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,309
But if I wish it aloud
it definitely won't happen.

622
00:59:35,342 --> 00:59:38,112
You talk like a baby
who isn't being spoilt enough.

623
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:42,516
I would like it

624
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:45,386
if you didn't make him
shoot real birds tomorrow.

625
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:47,921
And I would like it

626
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:52,259
if you didn't buy me pearls because
you bought us both the same thing.

627
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,232
And if they're
circling...

628
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:01,402
it seems they're circling just
me.

629
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:03,003
Not you.

630
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:05,205
Just me.

631
01:00:06,473 --> 01:00:08,442
Perhaps because I always take
care to close my curtains.

632
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:27,928
Look.

633
01:00:29,363 --> 01:00:32,332
The thing is, Diana,
there has to be two of you.

634
01:00:34,669 --> 01:00:38,505
You... There's... There's two of me,
there's two of Father, two of everyone.

635
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:40,608
There's the real one,

636
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:44,111
and the one they take pictures
of.

637
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:50,184
Now,
we are given tasks.

638
01:00:50,685 --> 01:00:53,621
You know, I...
I hated to shoot at first.

639
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,591
I gave my gun to the other one,
but...

640
01:00:57,391 --> 01:01:00,227
But you know,
you have to be able to make your...

641
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,995
body do things...

642
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:03,665
you hate.

643
01:01:05,566 --> 01:01:07,000
That you hate?

644
01:01:09,136 --> 01:01:11,271
- That you hate.
- That you hate?

645
01:01:13,307 --> 01:01:14,374
Yes.

646
01:01:17,377 --> 01:01:19,213
For the good of the
country.

647
01:01:21,715 --> 01:01:24,117
- Of the country?
- Yes, the people.

648
01:01:25,118 --> 01:01:27,087
Because they don't want us
to be people.

649
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:31,258
That's how it is.

650
01:01:33,828 --> 01:01:35,663
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

651
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:58,385
So please,
stick to the list as it is written,

652
01:01:58,653 --> 01:02:00,387
in the order that it is written.

653
01:02:00,622 --> 01:02:03,625
- The dresser gets upset.
- I want Maggie back.

654
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:06,527
Someone heard Maggie saying
she thinks you're cracking up.

655
01:02:06,828 --> 01:02:09,096
What?

656
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:12,132
Yes, everyone here
hears everything.

657
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,536
They just don't always
tell you what they've heard.

658
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:28,115
<i>This can be an opportunity to
reflect on our own good fortune</i>

659
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,084
<i>and on whether we have
anything to offer,</i>

660
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:32,386
<i>by way of example,</i>

661
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:36,456
<i>to those who have recently
broken free of dictatorship.</i>

662
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:39,393
<i>We,
who claim to be of the free world,</i>

663
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:43,130
<i>should examine what we
really mean by freedom.</i>

664
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:46,266
<i>And how we can help
to ensure</i>

665
01:02:46,567 --> 01:02:49,436
<i>that once in place,
it is there to stay.</i>

666
01:02:51,204 --> 01:02:54,474
<i>There are all sorts of
elements to a free society.</i>

667
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,580
<i>But I believe that
among the most important</i>

668
01:02:59,379 --> 01:03:01,515
<i>is the willingness of
ordinary men and women...</i>

669
01:03:03,216 --> 01:03:04,518
Good girl.

670
01:03:09,924 --> 01:03:11,291
Your Majesty.

671
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:21,669
I really like the dress
you wore on television.

672
01:03:24,237 --> 01:03:26,573
Wasn't the one
my dresser recommended.

673
01:03:28,576 --> 01:03:31,144
They take a lot of photographs of
you, don't they?

674
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:36,483
The only portrait that really matters is
the one they put on the ten pound note.

675
01:03:36,684 --> 01:03:39,553
When they take that one,
you understand all you are,

676
01:03:39,587 --> 01:03:40,855
my dear, is currency.

677
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,158
Come on.

678
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:03,477
The turkey and the goose
will be accompanied by the following:

679
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:07,615
plum sauce, bread sauce,
cranberry sauce, cloudberry sauce,

680
01:04:08,415 --> 01:04:10,384
potatoes, carrots and spinach.

681
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:12,954
Three plums for the Prince of
Wales.

682
01:04:12,987 --> 01:04:14,154
Organic carrots.

683
01:04:14,187 --> 01:04:16,591
Please, be careful which
box we take the carrots from

684
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:18,425
because he will bloody check.

685
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:21,528
Parsnips, again
organic.

686
01:04:21,561 --> 01:04:24,498
Okay, on to dessert.

687
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:27,869
We have soufflé d'abricots,
bread and butter pudding,

688
01:04:27,902 --> 01:04:31,471
a Christmas pudding chocolate yule
log, plum pudding,

689
01:04:31,505 --> 01:04:33,841
mince pies, raspberry croquets,

690
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:36,777
pastries, fondants,
chocolate mousses,

691
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:40,848
<i>white</i> chocolate mousses,
crème brûlée.

692
01:04:40,882 --> 01:04:45,252
Finally, a selection of
sweet and savoury organic biscuits.

693
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:46,888
Organic biscuits from?

694
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:48,755
Highgrove, chef!

695
01:04:49,423 --> 01:04:50,557
Yes,

696
01:04:50,992 --> 01:04:52,627
yes, bloody Highgrove.

697
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:56,898
Right. Okay, the time now
is ten minutes past three.

698
01:04:56,931 --> 01:04:59,466
Dinner will be served
at eight p.m. precisely...

699
01:05:20,922 --> 01:05:22,756
What happens to the pheasants?

700
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:28,261
What happens to the pheasants
that my son will be shooting?

701
01:05:31,298 --> 01:05:32,633
After the shoot...

702
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,368
we'll dress them
and we'll pluck them and...

703
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,872
everyone will take a brace
home with them.

704
01:05:39,874 --> 01:05:41,541
There will be lots left over.

705
01:05:42,944 --> 01:05:45,680
The staff get some, the dogs get
some, and the rest is thrown away.

706
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:48,749
Thrown away...

707
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:54,689
The pheasants are bred to be shot, Ma'am.
But for the gun, they wouldn't be there.

708
01:05:55,388 --> 01:05:57,892
And the ones that don't get
shot, they just get run over.

709
01:05:57,925 --> 01:05:59,793
They're not the brightest of
birds.

710
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:02,395
Beautiful but not very bright.

711
01:06:04,065 --> 01:06:06,399
Did you read
the Vogue article about me?

712
01:06:07,701 --> 01:06:11,606
I've put soufflé d'abricots on
the menu for you, your favourite.

713
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:14,041
And I will make it myself for
you.

714
01:06:16,978 --> 01:06:18,045
Fine.

715
01:06:23,383 --> 01:06:24,718
Do you mind?

716
01:06:28,122 --> 01:06:30,524
I've been reading
about Anne Boleyn.

717
01:06:30,992 --> 01:06:31,959
Oh.

718
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,862
I never remember which one is
which.

719
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:38,699
She's the one who was beheaded
by King Henry VIII.

720
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,869
Because he said
that she was having an affair.

721
01:06:41,903 --> 01:06:44,906
But in fact he was the one
who was having the affair.

722
01:06:47,108 --> 01:06:48,441
I think I saw her.

723
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:50,310
The ghost of her.

724
01:06:50,343 --> 01:06:54,414
Everything you say to any member
of staff here becomes currency.

725
01:06:54,615 --> 01:06:57,517
Do you understand?
It becomes currency in these rooms.

726
01:06:57,985 --> 01:06:59,053
Good.

727
01:06:59,786 --> 01:07:00,922
Excellent.

728
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:03,757
I'm prepared for my future

729
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:06,627
as a face on a coin
to be passed from hand to hand.

730
01:07:06,661 --> 01:07:08,029
No.

731
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:10,097
You don't even think that.

732
01:07:11,899 --> 01:07:14,001
Did Maggie say
that I was cracking up?

733
01:07:15,535 --> 01:07:16,736
Which one's Maggie?

734
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:23,443
I thought she was my friend.

735
01:07:25,146 --> 01:07:26,647
Did she say it?

736
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:28,381
I... I don't listen.

737
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:29,716
I just cook.

738
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,722
Some things are best
not said out loud.

739
01:07:37,592 --> 01:07:38,792
Stories of ghosts,

740
01:07:38,826 --> 01:07:41,863
cutting off of heads and any
odd thing that you might say,

741
01:07:41,896 --> 01:07:43,598
they get repeated here.

742
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:47,467
But if I don't say it out loud,
they read it on my face.

743
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,737
- They can all see into me.
- Ma'am.

744
01:07:51,205 --> 01:07:53,941
Usually when they
sit at these tables and talk,

745
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:55,475
they're laughing.

746
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:59,113
At all the oddness
and all the scandals.

747
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:04,417
But with you,
they do not laugh.

748
01:08:07,154 --> 01:08:08,990
They're gentle with
you.

749
01:08:09,957 --> 01:08:11,558
And they're kind.

750
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:14,561
And they are worried.

751
01:08:18,732 --> 01:08:20,500
They want you to survive.

752
01:08:22,103 --> 01:08:25,772
As the person you were when you
first came here ten years ago.

753
01:08:30,811 --> 01:08:33,114
Do you have access
to wire cutters?

754
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:37,550
Why do you want wire cutters,
Diana?

755
01:08:38,252 --> 01:08:39,654
To cut wire.

756
01:08:57,939 --> 01:08:59,472
Oh, go on.

757
01:09:00,007 --> 01:09:01,142
Fly away.

758
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,645
Before it's too late.

759
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:12,586
If you are going to fly anywhere,
may I recommend Kensington?

760
01:09:13,921 --> 01:09:16,723
They wouldn't shoot you there.

761
01:09:17,024 --> 01:09:19,627
They'd make a fuss
of your beautiful feathers.

762
01:09:20,794 --> 01:09:22,529
Look at the colours, they'd say.

763
01:09:24,031 --> 01:09:26,968
And everyone would start wearing
feathers just like yours.

764
01:09:28,302 --> 01:09:30,570
You're so lucky,
because you can wear the same outfit.

765
01:09:30,604 --> 01:09:31,439
Forgive me, Ma'am,

766
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:33,607
But you need to get ready for
dinner.

767
01:09:34,774 --> 01:09:35,910
It's almost five.

768
01:09:38,545 --> 01:09:39,746
Dinner's at eight.

769
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:43,117
Your dresser needs to dress you Ma'am.
Come, come.

770
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,618
I'll be along shortly.

771
01:09:57,797 --> 01:09:58,933
Ma'am, may I?

772
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:09,743
You know,
some years ago I was in Belfast.

773
01:10:10,744 --> 01:10:12,613
The Falls Road.

774
01:10:12,646 --> 01:10:14,148
Sour times back then.

775
01:10:15,349 --> 01:10:16,783
We were in an alley.

776
01:10:17,284 --> 01:10:18,785
About to cross...

777
01:10:19,286 --> 01:10:21,055
I had a good friend beside me.

778
01:10:21,856 --> 01:10:22,957
A good friend.

779
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:25,826
Soldiers become more than
friends, you know?

780
01:10:27,428 --> 01:10:31,065
Anyway, to stop our legs
from shaking, he was telling me a story.

781
01:10:31,098 --> 01:10:34,001
He was brought up in a farm up
in the Highlands and he was...

782
01:10:34,035 --> 01:10:35,302
He was talking about some horse

783
01:10:35,336 --> 01:10:38,639
that his father had bought at
the fair that couldn't be tamed.

784
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:41,541
Lots of funny stories

785
01:10:41,775 --> 01:10:45,545
about this wild horse throwing
his brothers around and such.

786
01:10:45,745 --> 01:10:46,947
But then he said...

787
01:10:48,616 --> 01:10:49,617
"But then,

788
01:10:50,084 --> 01:10:51,785
one fine morning..."

789
01:10:54,688 --> 01:10:56,924
In that moment, the bullet hit
him.

790
01:10:56,957 --> 01:11:00,794
Back of the head, out through his nose.
And he fell onto me and...

791
01:11:01,328 --> 01:11:02,696
I hugged him.

792
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:03,998
Close.

793
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:06,901
Saved myself from the next
bullet.

794
01:11:07,668 --> 01:11:09,070
Hmm.

795
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:13,107
Never did find out
what happened to that wild horse.

796
01:11:13,706 --> 01:11:17,311
I asked myself,
who do we soldiers die for?

797
01:11:22,216 --> 01:11:24,051
Then I remembered my oath.

798
01:11:25,718 --> 01:11:28,721
We all make
an oath of loyalty to the Crown.

799
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:31,724
It's not the human beings, you
see?

800
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:35,262
But it's the oath you chose to
believe.

801
01:11:36,664 --> 01:11:39,934
Their faults, their weaknesses,
that's not what you think about

802
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:41,969
when you're in an alley
in the Falls Road.

803
01:11:42,702 --> 01:11:45,106
You think only
about your oath.

804
01:11:45,772 --> 01:11:46,974
And what that means.

805
01:11:50,077 --> 01:11:51,879
I don't want anyone to die for
me.

806
01:11:53,447 --> 01:11:55,916
And I hope your friend's wild
horse

807
01:11:57,717 --> 01:11:58,886
was never tamed.

808
01:12:04,258 --> 01:12:05,594
Ma'am.

809
01:12:07,428 --> 01:12:09,196
I've been asked to ensure

810
01:12:10,064 --> 01:12:11,265
that this time,

811
01:12:11,866 --> 01:12:13,733
unlike your arrival at the
House,

812
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:15,903
you arrive for dinner on time.

813
01:12:17,338 --> 01:12:20,341
It is Her Majesty and the House
of Windsor I am pledged to serve.

814
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:22,376
And I speak with their voice.

815
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:26,113
So please, there really is no
time for indulgence, Ma'am.

816
01:12:30,384 --> 01:12:32,920
It was you who put the book
on my bed.

817
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:36,056
What book?

818
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:38,926
You put it there as a warning.

819
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:43,230
I really have no idea what
you are talking about, Ma'am.

820
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:39,053
Ma'am, there seems
to have been some confusion

821
01:13:39,086 --> 01:13:41,155
about which dress to wear and
when.

822
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:45,226
Yes, you reported my confusion
faithfully.

823
01:13:46,427 --> 01:13:48,162
Perhaps you've taken an oath.

824
01:13:52,967 --> 01:13:55,269
The curtains
have been fastened, Ma'am.

825
01:13:56,136 --> 01:13:59,206
That is, I was told to sew them
by His Royal Highness.

826
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,176
There have been reports
of people in the grounds.

827
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:19,860
They think photographers.

828
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:22,196
We thought it wise.

829
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,131
Yes, it is wise.

830
01:14:25,499 --> 01:14:27,968
- For Christmas dinner.
- It's very wise...

831
01:14:28,002 --> 01:14:29,169
I took it in.

832
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:31,839
You have lost weight.

833
01:14:33,073 --> 01:14:34,241
Shall we try it on?

834
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:37,777
Ma'am, I will help you.

835
01:14:40,381 --> 01:14:42,149
How can you help me?

836
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:13,113
I thought at first it might not
fit me.

837
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:15,215
But it does.

838
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:17,518
There's even a little room left
in it to accommodate for dinner.

839
01:15:21,455 --> 01:15:22,456
There we are.

840
01:15:27,928 --> 01:15:29,129
Hmm.

841
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:30,632
Will you wear it?

842
01:15:30,665 --> 01:15:32,199
Of course I will wear it.

843
01:15:34,101 --> 01:15:36,337
It says on the label
"Christmas Day dinner,"

844
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,138
and it's Christmas Day dinner.

845
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:39,506
What else would I wear?

846
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:44,111
Now leave me.

847
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,081
I wish to masturbate.

848
01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:50,217
Ma'am.

849
01:15:53,655 --> 01:15:55,556
You can tell everyone I said
that.

850
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:56,283
Ma'am.

851
01:16:56,316 --> 01:16:59,153
- Dinner is served in 30 minutes.
- God.

852
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:27,548
Yes, I'm coming!

853
01:17:37,191 --> 01:17:38,091
Mummy?

854
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:41,395
Mummy?

855
01:17:49,036 --> 01:17:50,137
Mummy,

856
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:53,240
you said to tell you
if you were being really silly.

857
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:57,044
Mummy, you're being really
silly.

858
01:17:59,046 --> 01:18:00,013
Please.

859
01:18:00,981 --> 01:18:02,382
Mummy, we have to sit
down before Granny.

860
01:18:04,785 --> 01:18:07,488
Ma'am,
dinner is served in ten minutes.

861
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:09,223
Yes, we are just...

862
01:18:12,059 --> 01:18:14,161
Mummy, just switch off your
mind.

863
01:18:14,394 --> 01:18:17,097
Don't think about it
until after dinner.

864
01:18:17,564 --> 01:18:18,765
For everyone's sake.

865
01:18:22,469 --> 01:18:24,404
The chef has made soufflé
d'abricots.

866
01:18:25,339 --> 01:18:26,674
It's just for me.

867
01:18:28,275 --> 01:18:29,776
It's not for them, it's for me.

868
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:32,614
You've got like one minute
to get dressed.

869
01:18:34,682 --> 01:18:36,083
You can do this.

870
01:18:37,819 --> 01:18:39,687
That's okay because...

871
01:18:40,187 --> 01:18:41,623
it only takes me one minute.

872
01:18:42,155 --> 01:18:44,224
I look great anyway.

873
01:18:46,426 --> 01:18:47,761
Did you see her in church?

874
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:50,364
See who, Mummy?

875
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,636
Jane Seymour, of course.

876
01:18:56,537 --> 01:18:57,571
Mummy...

877
01:18:58,205 --> 01:19:00,140
- I'll be one minute.
- Okay.

878
01:19:00,774 --> 01:19:02,577
Okay... one minute.

879
01:19:06,346 --> 01:19:07,781
I just need one minute.

880
01:19:13,588 --> 01:19:15,657
- Just one minute. Sorry.
- No, no!

881
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:18,292
- It's okay, it's okay!
- No, please, Mummy.

882
01:19:43,317 --> 01:19:44,384
Ma'am?

883
01:19:45,285 --> 01:19:47,220
Dessert is about to be served.

884
01:19:49,523 --> 01:19:52,259
The soufflé d'abricots
is just for me.

885
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,764
Ma'am, I've been told
to wait for you.

886
01:19:59,601 --> 01:20:01,335
That's very kind of you.

887
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:03,737
Very kind...

888
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:06,239
Ma'am?

889
01:20:09,543 --> 01:20:10,544
Diana.

890
01:20:18,285 --> 01:20:19,252
Come.

891
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:21,321
Emergency!

892
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,227
Hold on.

893
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:28,896
Fight them.

894
01:20:30,364 --> 01:20:31,531
Be beautiful.

895
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,235
You are your own weapon.

896
01:20:36,203 --> 01:20:37,905
Don't cut it to
pieces.

897
01:20:37,939 --> 01:20:40,774
Okay,
but you have to stay with me.

898
01:20:42,776 --> 01:20:43,911
You can't leave me.

899
01:20:45,445 --> 01:20:47,649
- No.
- Stay with me.

900
01:20:47,915 --> 01:20:48,816
Of course.

901
01:20:59,827 --> 01:21:01,461
Where is she?

902
01:21:02,362 --> 01:21:03,831
Ma'am?

903
01:21:06,834 --> 01:21:08,936
Ma'am, they are all waiting.

904
01:21:44,337 --> 01:21:45,372
Ma'am, please.

905
01:21:49,509 --> 01:21:51,211
Tell them I'm not well.

906
01:21:53,981 --> 01:21:56,249
Tell them I'm not at
all well!

907
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:09,664
Tell them I am not well.

908
01:22:10,832 --> 01:22:12,299
Tell them I'm not well.

909
01:22:21,042 --> 01:22:23,310
Go tell them I'm not
well!

910
01:22:32,954 --> 01:22:33,821
Ma'am.

911
01:22:34,788 --> 01:22:37,491
I need a pair of Wellingtons.
And a torch.

912
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:47,734
Thank you.

913
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:50,403
Where are you going, Ma'am?

914
01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:51,973
Home.

915
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:04,018
Sir.

916
01:23:04,952 --> 01:23:06,954
The Princess of Wales
has gone outside.

917
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:09,790
She said she's going
home.

918
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:13,594
Really? How odd.

919
01:23:16,363 --> 01:23:17,932
I think that means
she's going to Park House.

920
01:23:19,566 --> 01:23:21,002
It's dangerous, Sir.

921
01:23:21,035 --> 01:23:23,503
The stairs and the floorboards,
they're rotten.

922
01:23:24,138 --> 01:23:27,407
If a princess wants to go home,
who are we to stand in her way?

923
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,613
If the constables report
anything,

924
01:23:33,114 --> 01:23:34,615
tell them to let her be.

925
01:23:36,017 --> 01:23:37,585
That is all she wants.

926
01:23:38,152 --> 01:23:39,553
For us all to just...

927
01:23:39,887 --> 01:23:40,888
let her be.

928
01:23:42,123 --> 01:23:43,024
Yes, Sir.

929
01:27:31,318 --> 01:27:32,820
So.

930
01:28:01,781 --> 01:28:04,685
Diana! Boys! Get inside!

931
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:09,416
Diana.

932
01:29:12,052 --> 01:29:13,954
You know he gave her
a picture of himself.

933
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:15,689
A miniature painting.

934
01:29:19,326 --> 01:29:21,362
She wore it
around her neck.

935
01:29:23,364 --> 01:29:25,166
- Same as the
one...

936
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,067
that I wore around my neck.

937
01:29:28,302 --> 01:29:29,837
So I just tore it off.

938
01:29:32,406 --> 01:29:33,706
Go.

939
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:37,111
Run.

940
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:57,171
Are you real?

941
01:33:58,572 --> 01:33:59,440
Yeah.

942
01:34:02,443 --> 01:34:03,477
Yeah.

943
01:34:11,653 --> 01:34:12,654
Hey.

944
01:34:46,688 --> 01:34:48,322
They asked me back.

945
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:52,694
They said they needed someone
to talk to you.

946
01:34:52,726 --> 01:34:53,760
Hmm.

947
01:34:57,731 --> 01:34:59,233
Who is "they"?

948
01:35:00,133 --> 01:35:01,603
The Prince of Wales.

949
01:35:02,503 --> 01:35:04,271
That was good of him.

950
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:06,273
He's not all bad.

951
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,208
None of them are.

952
01:35:08,408 --> 01:35:09,443
No.

953
01:35:10,444 --> 01:35:12,312
They asked me to suggest
that you see a doctor.

954
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:15,617
They say you've been...

955
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:17,184
cutting yourself again.

956
01:35:18,185 --> 01:35:19,353
Hmm.

957
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:20,655
How do they know?

958
01:35:21,689 --> 01:35:23,591
- They know everything.
- They don't.

959
01:35:26,426 --> 01:35:29,429
They don't know that Anne
Boleyn saved my life last night.

960
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:36,370
I've been imagining how they'll
write about me in a thousand years.

961
01:35:37,337 --> 01:35:38,539
If you're Royal,

962
01:35:40,008 --> 01:35:42,309
the more time that passes,
the fewer words they use to describe you.

963
01:35:42,342 --> 01:35:43,710
William: "the Conqueror."

964
01:35:45,112 --> 01:35:47,447
Elizabeth: "the Virgin."
Diana...

965
01:35:54,288 --> 01:35:55,789
If I ever do become Queen,

966
01:35:57,224 --> 01:35:58,425
what will I be?

967
01:36:00,828 --> 01:36:01,829
Insane?

968
01:36:07,701 --> 01:36:09,803
He said that you told someone
that...

969
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:12,439
you thought I was cracking up.

970
01:36:14,374 --> 01:36:15,375
It's okay.

971
01:36:16,176 --> 01:36:17,511
But did you say it?

972
01:36:23,885 --> 01:36:26,186
Before I answer that question,

973
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,521
- Ma'am...
- Hmm.

974
01:36:28,455 --> 01:36:29,723
For what it's worth...

975
01:36:31,325 --> 01:36:34,795
I've never told you this and it probably
means you'll have to fire me, but...

976
01:36:36,831 --> 01:36:39,099
well actually,
I'm in love with you.

977
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:44,171
Yes, I mean...

978
01:36:44,204 --> 01:36:45,772
I mean in that way.

979
01:36:48,475 --> 01:36:49,476
Completely.

980
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:59,419
So, I suppose the one word
I'd use to describe you

981
01:36:59,453 --> 01:37:00,622
would be "shocked."

982
01:37:02,189 --> 01:37:04,659
Diana: "the Shocked."

983
01:37:09,730 --> 01:37:11,131
Um...

984
01:37:11,599 --> 01:37:14,434
- Goodness.
- Yes, quite.

985
01:37:14,468 --> 01:37:15,903
So what do you say to that?

986
01:37:17,738 --> 01:37:20,608
- I...
- Shock does wonders apparently.

987
01:37:22,409 --> 01:37:25,278
And I know...
I know you don't see me in that way.

988
01:37:25,312 --> 01:37:28,148
- No, I...
- It's perfectly fine. I'm a grown-up.

989
01:37:31,718 --> 01:37:33,754
I just thought I'd lighten the gloom
with something totally unexpected.

990
01:37:34,755 --> 01:37:35,623
Bam.

991
01:37:38,425 --> 01:37:40,794
Just think of all the times
I've seen you naked.

992
01:37:45,799 --> 01:37:47,267
I'm surprised, but...

993
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:48,568
completely...

994
01:37:48,903 --> 01:37:50,771
I'm grown-up about... this.

995
01:37:51,538 --> 01:37:53,407
No, you're not.
You're not.

996
01:37:53,707 --> 01:37:55,877
You're having a childish giggle
and I love it.

997
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:58,579
Fuck doctors.
What you need is love.

998
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:02,684
Love, shocks and laughter.

999
01:38:04,418 --> 01:38:05,552
Plenty of it.

1000
01:38:07,421 --> 01:38:09,456
- I...
- You ready for that walk now?

1001
01:38:29,577 --> 01:38:31,646
It's going out.
Further and further.

1002
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,596
One hour to the guns.

1003
01:38:49,931 --> 01:38:51,599
Load the shoot boxes, please.

1004
01:38:55,069 --> 01:38:59,573
Eggs, dairy and cheese are our
friends. Meats and oils our enemies.

1005
01:38:59,841 --> 01:39:03,276
Remember, salt cellars
will lie down with the spices

1006
01:39:03,543 --> 01:39:05,312
on muslin bed sheets.

1007
01:39:28,368 --> 01:39:30,337
- Just do your best, okay?
- Yes.

1008
01:40:28,428 --> 01:40:30,564
Park the car
in the staff car park

1009
01:40:30,598 --> 01:40:32,700
and leave the keys
in the glove compartment.

1010
01:40:33,466 --> 01:40:34,936
Why?
What are you going to do?

1011
01:40:37,104 --> 01:40:39,539
I'm going to take my place
among the pheasants.

1012
01:40:41,075 --> 01:40:42,043
No...

1013
01:40:42,577 --> 01:40:43,811
Seriously. What?

1014
01:40:43,845 --> 01:40:44,946
No, seriously.

1015
01:40:46,546 --> 01:40:48,983
Oh, Maggie, it's all just a bit of
fun, isn't it?

1016
01:40:51,551 --> 01:40:52,519
Men.

1017
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,088
Husbands, sex.

1018
01:40:55,022 --> 01:40:55,957
Mistresses.

1019
01:40:56,756 --> 01:40:57,757
Deceit.

1020
01:40:58,491 --> 01:40:59,492
Succession.

1021
01:41:01,494 --> 01:41:02,663
It's currency.

1022
01:41:03,931 --> 01:41:05,066
That's all we are.

1023
01:41:05,498 --> 01:41:06,901
I like nice things

1024
01:41:08,735 --> 01:41:10,838
that are simple, ordinary.

1025
01:41:11,873 --> 01:41:13,406
But things that are real.

1026
01:41:14,175 --> 01:41:16,143
You know,
I really like things that are

1027
01:41:16,611 --> 01:41:18,545
quite middle-class,
unfashionable.

1028
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,413
I love <i>Les Mis,</i> I love...

1029
01:41:20,714 --> 01:41:21,916
<i>Phantom of the Opera.</i>

1030
01:41:22,749 --> 01:41:23,851
I love fast food.

1031
01:41:24,952 --> 01:41:27,520
I feel sorry for pheasants.

1032
01:41:27,955 --> 01:41:29,522
There's no hope for me.

1033
01:41:29,924 --> 01:41:31,025
Not with them.

1034
01:41:34,929 --> 01:41:36,931
I'm going to see you
back in Kensington.

1035
01:41:37,464 --> 01:41:38,765
I can't wait.

1036
01:41:40,567 --> 01:41:42,802
- I'll have a pheasant feather in my hat.
- Okay.

1037
01:43:50,764 --> 01:43:52,333
Saboteur!

1038
01:43:52,366 --> 01:43:55,002
Hold your fire!

1039
01:43:57,371 --> 01:43:58,705
Boys!

1040
01:44:00,007 --> 01:44:01,842
I want to take you home.

1041
01:44:14,121 --> 01:44:16,223
I'm not moving
from this spot

1042
01:44:16,957 --> 01:44:18,592
until they come to me!

1043
01:44:28,135 --> 01:44:30,137
You'll just have to
shoot me!

1044
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,288
Go.

1045
01:44:49,722 --> 01:44:51,058
You... try to help her.

1046
01:44:54,895 --> 01:44:56,729
Your Royal Highness,
do you want me to intervene here?

1047
01:44:56,763 --> 01:44:57,865
My sons...

1048
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:01,268
are going to join their mother.

1049
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:07,608
So everyone hold your
fire.

1050
01:45:08,976 --> 01:45:10,010
Go.

1051
01:45:34,168 --> 01:45:35,035
Yes.

1052
01:45:35,336 --> 01:45:36,270
Okay.

1053
01:45:36,303 --> 01:45:37,304
Oh!

1054
01:45:46,881 --> 01:45:47,780
Come on!

1055
01:45:47,815 --> 01:45:50,284
- Slowpoke! Slowpoke!
- Come on!

1056
01:45:50,317 --> 01:45:53,120
- Come on!
- Do you want to be first?

1057
01:45:53,888 --> 01:45:54,955
Come on, Mummy.

1058
01:45:58,758 --> 01:46:00,127
Hang on. Boys.

1059
01:46:02,429 --> 01:46:04,098
Come here. Come on, come on.

1060
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:06,433
Feet up, feet up.

1061
01:46:08,869 --> 01:46:10,703
What are we?

1062
01:46:11,438 --> 01:46:12,840
Seventeen and a half stone.

1063
01:46:13,974 --> 01:46:15,843
- There.
- Come, Mummy.

1064
01:46:15,876 --> 01:46:17,278
That's how much
I enjoyed myself.

1065
01:46:17,311 --> 01:46:19,880
- Ma'am, shall I bring the car?
- Tell Major Gregory:

1066
01:46:19,914 --> 01:46:21,748
seventeen and a half stone.

1067
01:46:21,781 --> 01:46:22,782
Write it down.

1068
01:46:24,885 --> 01:46:26,253
Right here, Mummy?

1069
01:46:26,921 --> 01:46:28,389
Are you leaving us, Ma'am?

1070
01:46:28,422 --> 01:46:30,357
Yes!
Isn't it terrible?

1071
01:46:30,391 --> 01:46:33,093
Yeah. Would you like me
to make you up some food?

1072
01:46:33,127 --> 01:46:34,361
There's a lot left over.

1073
01:46:34,929 --> 01:46:36,964
No, I've promised them a real
treat.

1074
01:46:37,831 --> 01:46:40,134
I missed your soufflé.

1075
01:46:40,501 --> 01:46:42,970
It would've only been wasted on
me, anyway.

1076
01:46:43,204 --> 01:46:44,305
We need the keys.

1077
01:46:46,207 --> 01:46:47,908
There's also a note.

1078
01:47:03,057 --> 01:47:04,124
Bye!

1079
01:47:21,976 --> 01:47:23,143
Where are we going?

1080
01:47:23,911 --> 01:47:24,777
Home.

1081
01:47:27,114 --> 01:47:28,916
- I'm cold.
- And I'm hungry.

1082
01:47:28,949 --> 01:47:31,252
Well, turn the heating up!
We're going to eat.

1083
01:47:34,355 --> 01:47:36,257
Where are we going to
eat?

1084
01:47:36,290 --> 01:47:37,491
Somewhere!

1085
01:47:37,925 --> 01:47:39,792
- Do you know?
- Trust me!

1086
01:47:39,827 --> 01:47:41,962
- Do you know?
- We'll find out!

1087
01:47:52,273 --> 01:47:54,408
<i>All I need is a
miracle</i>

1088
01:47:54,908 --> 01:47:58,078
<i>All I need is you</i>

1089
01:47:59,346 --> 01:48:01,781
<i>All I need is a miracle</i>

1090
01:48:01,982 --> 01:48:04,784
<i>All I need is you</i>

1091
01:48:06,453 --> 01:48:08,922
<i>All I need is a
miracle</i>

1092
01:48:08,956 --> 01:48:12,059
<i>All I need is you</i>

1093
01:48:43,457 --> 01:48:45,025
I love this car.

1094
01:48:45,059 --> 01:48:46,427
I love this song!

1095
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:49,330
<i>I'm gonna love
you for the rest of your life</i>

1096
01:48:53,567 --> 01:48:54,602
Let's go!

1097
01:49:15,022 --> 01:49:16,357
<i>Can I take your
order?</i>

1098
01:49:17,491 --> 01:49:18,892
Three times chicken.

1099
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,563
Three times fries.
Two colas and an orange juice, please.

1100
01:49:23,364 --> 01:49:24,531
<i>And what name is
it?</i>

1101
01:49:26,066 --> 01:49:27,067
Spencer.
