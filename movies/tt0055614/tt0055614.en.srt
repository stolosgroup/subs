MAN: Watch this shot now!
Shoot, man! Go!

3
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:43,879
Pow! Pow!

4
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,412
Yeah!

5
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,621
Huh.

00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,447
SHARK 1: Chickie!
Chick, chick, chick!

00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,199
SHARK 2: Boy! Jet boy!

8
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,867
Jet boy!

9
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,213
Jet, jet, Jets!

10
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,299
JET 1: Come back!
JET 2: Come over here!

11
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,384
Chickens!

12
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,679
ALL: Ha!

13
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,899
ALL: Beat it!

14
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,412
Yeah!

15
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,208
JET 3: All right, go, Jets!

16
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,256
Snowboy!

17
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,893
Come on!

18
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,778
Beat it!

19
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,748
Chico!
Andale, chico!

20
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,125
JET 4: Okay, here we go!

21
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,878
JET 5: Over here, A-Rab!

22
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,746
ACTION:
Jets! Jets!

23
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,004
Bernardo!
Indio! Chaco,
come on!

24
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,179
SHARK 2: Jets, come on!
Follow me, baby.

25
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,277
SHARK 3: Mira, mira, mira!

26
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,570
SHARKS: Hey, Jets!

27
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,829
Andale, chico!

28
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,665
Come on, Jets!

29
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,750
SHARKS: Jets!

30
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,711
Hello!

31
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,049
Jets, come on! Julio!

32
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,968
Come on!

33
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,181
Jets!

34
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,687
Come on, boys!

35
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,523
Come on, now!

36
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:32,955
Jets!

37
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,066
SCHRANK:
Break it up, you punks!
Cut it out!

38
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,068
Come on, guys!
Break it up, I said!

39
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,404
Come on, break it up!
Come on!

40
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,323
How many times
have I told you punks
to cut this stuff out?

41
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,367
Why, if it ain't
Lt. Schrank!

42
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,494
JETS: Top of the day,
Lt. Schrank.

43
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,246
And Officer Krupke.

44
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,081
SHARKS: Top of the day,
Officer Krupke.

45
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,499
I'll give you
the top of the head.

46
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,001
You, get down!

47
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,502
But we're having
such fun.

48
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,004
We enjoy
the playground.

49
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,007
See, it keeps us
deprived children off
of the foul city streets.

50
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,133
Shut up!

51
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,051
And born like we was
on the hot pavement.

52
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,136
You wanna get
your skull broke?

53
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,554
Baby John,
come here!

54
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,848
Come here!

55
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,729
All right!

56
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,565
Now, which one of
these Puerto Ricans
bloodied you? Huh?

57
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,860
Sir...
Which one?

58
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,862
Excuse me, sir.

59
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,864
As a matter of fact...

60
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,200
...we suspicion
that the job
was done by a cop.

61
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,119
Two cops.
At the very least.

62
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,162
Impossible.

63
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,081
In America,
nothing is impossible.

64
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,876
All right,
wise guys...

65
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,128
...now,
you listen to me!

66
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,546
All of you!

67
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,215
You hoodlums don't
own these streets.

68
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,633
And I've had
all the roughhouse

69
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,385
I'm gonna put up with
around here!

70
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,096
You wanna
kill each other,
kill each other!

71
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,390
But you ain't
gonna do it on my beat!

72
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,475
Are there any questions?

73
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,559
Yes, sir.

74
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,896
Would you mind
translating that
into Spanish?

75
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,526
Get your friends
out of here, Bernardo.

76
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,904
And stay out!

77
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,619
Please.

78
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,373
Okay, Sharks.

79
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,084
Vámonos.

80
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,095
Boy!

81
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,223
As if this neighborhood
wasn't crummy enough!

82
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,602
Now, look, fellas.
Fellas!

83
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,771
Look, let's be
reasonable...

84
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,399
...if I don't get
a little law and order
around here...

85
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,068
...I get busted down
to a traffic corner...

86
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,612
...and your friend
don't like
traffic corners.

87
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,656
That means you're gonna
start makin' nice...

88
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,741
...with the PRs
from now on.

89
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,161
I said nice! Get it?

90
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,956
'Cause if you don't...

91
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,960
...and I catch any of you
doin' any more brawlin'
in my territory...

92
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,712
...I'll beat the livin' crud
out of every one of you...

93
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,507
...and see
you go to the can
and rot there!

94
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,720
Say good-bye to
the nice boys, Krupke.

95
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,764
Good-bye, boys.

96
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,937
"Good-bye, boys."

97
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,314
Jail? Gee.

98
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,067
"You hoodlums
don't own the streets."

99
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,444
Go play in the park.

100
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,570
Keep off
of the grass.

101
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,654
Get out
of the house!

102
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,738
Keep off the block.

103
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,490
Get outta here.
Keep off the world!

104
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,909
A gang that don't own
the street is nothin'!

105
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,494
We do own it!

106
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,956
Come on, Jets,
round out!

107
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,167
Not you, Anybodys!
Beat it!

108
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,210
Riff,
you gotta let me
in the gang!

109
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,298
Didn't you just see me?
I was smash!
I'm a killer, I wanna fight.

110
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,549
How else she
gonna get a guy
to touch her?

111
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,926
You dirty rat!

112
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,553
Come on, the road,
little girl! The road!

113
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,305
Beat it!

114
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,183
ALL: Beat it!

115
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,392
Okay, come on.

116
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,525
Okay, now listen!

117
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,068
Now, we fought hard
for this turf,

118
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,404
and we ain't just
gonna give it up.

119
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,281
The Emeralds claimed it,
we shot 'em out.

120
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,449
The Hawks tried
to take it away,

121
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,992
we knocked them
down the cellar.

122
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,327
But these PRs
are different.

123
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,204
They multiply.
Like cockroaches.

124
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,247
Shut the door!
They're eatin' all the food.

125
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,582
Breathin' all the air.

126
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,958
Help! I'm drowning
in tamale.

127
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,586
And you heard
what that
Lt. Schrank said...

128
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,006
...we gotta make nice
with them
Puerto Ricans or else.

129
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,300
We gotta let 'em move in
right under our noses...

130
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,384
...and take it
all away from us or else.

131
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,469
ALL: No!

132
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,387
You're damn right, no!

133
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,723
So what're we
gonna do, buddy boys?

134
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,850
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

135
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,560
We're gonna speed back!

136
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,354
We're gonna move
like lightnin',

137
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,105
and we're gonna
clean them Sharks up...

138
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,398
...once and for all.

139
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,276
So they ain't never gonna
set foot on our turf again!

140
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,948
We're gonna do it
in one all-out fight.

141
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,574
A rumble! Chop, chop!

142
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,201
Now cool, Action Boy.

143
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,122
The Sharks want
a piece of this world, too.
And they're real down boys.

144
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,458
They might ask
for blades...

145
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,835
...zip guns.
Zip guns?

146
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,671
Gee!

147
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,174
I ain't finalizin'
and sayin' they will,
Baby John.

148
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,470
I'm just sayin'
that they might,
and we gotta be prepared.

149
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,515
Now, what's your mood, Jets?

150
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,183
I say go, go!

151
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,268
I say mix!

152
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,644
I say sock 'em!
Tear them!

153
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,730
Yeah, but if they
say blades or guns...

154
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,399
I say let's just
forget the whole thing.

155
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,525
What?

156
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,693
What do you say, Riff?

157
00:19:55,903 --> 00:20:00,115
I say this turf is small,
but it's all we got, huh.

158
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,452
I wanna hold it
like we always held it,
with skin!

159
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,832
But if they say blades,
I say blades.

160
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,002
If they say guns,
I say guns.

161
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,797
I say I want the Jets
to be the number one!

162
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,799
To sail! To hold the sky!

163
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,843
Then rev us off!
Voom va-voom!

164
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,887
RIFF: Okay, cats, we rumble!

165
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,639
Now...

166
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,434
...protocality calls
for a war council...

167
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,603
...between us and the Sharks
to set the whole thing up.

168
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,522
So I will personally
give the bad news
to Bernardo.

169
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,690
You gotta take
a lieutenant with you.

170
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,816
That's me.

171
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,568
That's Tony.
Who needs Tony?

172
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,194
We need Tony!

173
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,031
He's got a rep
that's bigger than
the whole West Side!

174
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,490
He don't belong no more.

175
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,075
Now, cut it, Action!

176
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,952
Me and Tony
started the Jets.

177
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,537
So where is he?

178
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,497
How come he takes a lousy,
stinkin' job?

179
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,124
Youth Board
corrupted him.

180
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,251
Yeah, temporary sickness!
Wait and see.

181
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,920
Remember them fists
the day we clobbered
the Emeralds!

182
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,255
He saved
my ever-loving neck!

183
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,840
Sure! He'll do it
again, too!

184
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,009
He always came through
for us and he always will.

Tony, you're not

249
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,925
I read you loud
and clear, Riff.

250
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,552
Then why don't
you say somethin'?

251
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:08,887
I don't wanna
hurt your feelings.

252
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,638
You're my buddy,
my pal, my best friend!

253
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,182
Womb to tomb?

254
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,976
Birth to earth.

255
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,646
That's why you gotta
come to the dance tonight
and stand up with me.

256
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,149
Come on, Tony.
Just say yes.

257
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,068
Riff, did you ever
stop to figure...

258
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:27,238
...how many bubbles
there are in one bottle
of this here soda pop?

259
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,115
Tony, this is important!

260
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,409
Everything's important,
Riff...

261
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,204
...you, me,
the sweet guy
I work for.

262
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,165
The Sharks walk bad.
They bite hard.

263
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,875
And if we don't
stop them now...

264
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,460
Here! Work for a living.

265
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,004
How do you like that?

266
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,381
Four and a half years
I live with a buddy
and his family.

267
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,509
I think I'm diggin'
a guy's character.

268
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,638
Boy, am I a victim
of disappointment in you!

269
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,516
End your sufferin',
little man.

270
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,185
Why don't you just
pack up your gear
and move out?

271
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,978
'Cause your ma's
hot for me.

272
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,860
No! It's 'cause
I hate livin'
with my buggin' uncle!

273
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,028
Come on!

274
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,196
Come on, uncle!

275
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,865
Now...

276
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,368
...go play games
with the Jets.

277
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,578
And why not?
They're the greatest.

278
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,205
Ain't they?

279
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,832
Were.

280
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,086
You found
somethin' better?

281
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,880
No. Not yet, but...

282
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,550
But what?

283
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,803
You won't dig it, Riff.

284
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,638
So try me.

285
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,558
Come on, Tony,
try me.

286
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,521
Okay.

287
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,403
Every single night
for the last month,
I wake up...

288
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,072
...and I'm reaching out.

289
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,741
For what?

290
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,951
I don't know.

291
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,287
A dame?

292
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,666
It's right outside the door,
just around the corner...

293
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,501
...but it's comin'.

294
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,794
What is?

295
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,088
I don't know. It...

296
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,217
It's like
the kick I used to get
from bein' a Jet.

297
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,052
Now you're talkin'!

298
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,471
Man, without a gang,
you're an orphan.

299
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,141
With a gang,
you walk in twos,
threes, fours...

300
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,517
...and your
crew is the best...

301
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,270
...when you're a Jet,
you're out in the sun,
buddy boy...

302
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,521
...you're home free home!

303
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,356
Riff, I've had it!

304
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,903
Tony...

305
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Tony, look at me,
will ya?

306
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,865
Come on, look at me.

307
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,908
I'm lookin' at you.

308
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:38,870
Now, I never asked
the time of day
from a clock, did I?

309
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:43,750
I never asked
nothin' from nobody,
but I'm askin' you...

310
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,668
...come to
the dance tonight.

311
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,047
I promised Doc
I'd clean up
the store tonight.

312
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,132
Then do it
after the dance.

313
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,886
Tony, I already told
the guys you'd be there.

314
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,889
If you don't show,
I'll be marked lousy.

315
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,683
What time'd
you tell 'em?

316
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,185
10:00.

317
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,687
For me, Tony,
for Riff!

318
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,568
10:00 it is.
Womb to tomb?

319
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,695
Birth to earth,
and I'll live
to regret this.

320
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,115
Who knows? Maybe what you're
waitin' for'll be twitchin'
at the dance tonight.

321
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,825

Por favor, Anita,
you are my friend.

368
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,816
Stop it, Maria.

369
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,150
You must
make the neck lower.

370
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,069
And you must
stop heckling me.

371
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,822
We are working
on our time now,
not the old lady's.

372
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,534
One inch. How much
can one little inch do?

373
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,244
Too much.

374
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:10,373
Anita, it is now to
be a dress for dancing,
no longer for praying!

375
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,669
Listen, with those boys,
you can start in dancing
and end up praying.

376
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,755
Querida, one little inch.

377
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,466
Bernardo made me promise!

378
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,009
Bernardo!

379
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,761
One month have
I been in this country.

380
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,596
Do I ever even
touch excitement?

381
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,474
I sew in this place all day.
I sit at home all night.

382
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,144
For what did
my fine brother
bring me here?

383
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,353
To marry Chino.

384
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,646
Chino.

385
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,982
When I look at Chino,
nothing happens.

386
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,192
What do you expect
to happen?

387
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,653
I don't know. Something.

388
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,616
What happens when
you look at Bernardo?

389
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,703
It's when I don't look
that it happens.

390
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,625
I think I will
tell Mama and Papa

391
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,044
about you and Nardo
in the balcony...

392
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,129
...of the movies!

393
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,630
I will rip this
to shreds!

394
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,882
No!

395
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,385
But if you
perhaps could manage
to lower the neck...

396
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,888
Next year.

397
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,806
I hate that dress!

398
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,143
Then don't wear it,
and don't come to the dance
with us tonight.

399
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,603
Don't come?

400
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,774
Could we not dye
it red at least?

401
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,735
No, we could not.

402
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,155
White is for babies.

403
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,239
Mmm-hmm...

404
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,409
I will be the only one
there in a white...

405
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:31,913
Ah.

406
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,961
Sí.

407
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,465
It is a beautiful dress.

408
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,258
I love you!

409
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,470
Are you ready, ladies?

410
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,679
Nardo, come in.

411
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,306
Is it not beautiful?

412
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,475
Yes.

413
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:53,976
Very.

414
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,436
I didn't quite hear.

415
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,939
Very beautiful.

416
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,901
Come in, Chino.
Do not be afraid.

417
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,736
But this is a shop
for ladies.

418
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,322
We won't bite you
till we know you better.

419
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:10,576
Chino, you will keep
both eyes on Maria tonight
in case I cannot.

420
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:11,702
You too, Anita.

421
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,746
My brother is
a silly watchdog.

422
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,915
My sister
is a precious jewel.

423
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,419
What am I?
Cut glass?

424
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:26,008
Nardo, it is most important
that I have a wonderful time
at the dancing tonight.

425
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,260
It is?

426
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,263
Because tonight
is the real beginning
of my life...

427
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,473
...as a young lady
of America.

428
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:10,928
MAN: Let's go!

429
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,873
Get outta here!

430
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,069
SHARK 1: Nardo. Cómo está?

431
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:11,864
SHARK 2: Chino. Chino!

432
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,576
Pepe! Pepe! Come on, guys!

433
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,372
Maria.

434
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,167
Look what I got.

435
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,753
Maria, these are
some of my friends
you've not met.

436
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,755
Pick up.

437
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,174
This is Loco.

438
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,675
Mucho gusto.
Encantada.

439
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,302
Teresita.
My sister Maria.

440
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,387
Good evening.

441
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,180
And this is
Luis and Rosa.

442
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,015
Encantada.
Rosalia, ai.

443
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,433
Oye, Nardo.

444
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,821
All right, boys and girls.
All right.

445
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,657
Attention, please!

446
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,452
Attention!

447
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:01,956
Come here.

448
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,707
GLAD HAND: Thank you.

449
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,752
My, this is a fine turnout
we have here tonight.

450
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,088
It's all for you,
Glad Hand.

451
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,383
I know all of you
boys and girls...

452
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,094
...are here
because you want to
make new friends...

453
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,055
...and get closer
to old ones.

454
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,390
CROWD: Yeah!

455
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,311
So, tonight, kids,
we're gonna do
something special.

456
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,481
We're gonna have
a get-together dance!

457
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,899
Ginger! Peachy!

458
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,237
All right, all right,
now, kids, kids...

459
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,407
...I want you to
form two circles.

460
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,533
How many?
Two.

461
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,953
Boys on the outside,
and girls on the inside.

462
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,329
Where are you?

463
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,499
All right.

464
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,959
Now...

465
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,337
...when the music stops...

466
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:55,342
...each boy dances
with whichever girl
is opposite, okay?

467
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,552
Okay!

468
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,929
Two circles, kids!

469
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,686
Well, it won't
hurt you to try.

470
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,563
It hurts.
It hurts!
It hurts.

471
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,149
Snowboy.

472
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:32,713
JET: I'm with it.

473
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,154
That's it, kids!
Keep the ball rolling.

474
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:01,659
Round she goes,
and where she stops,
nobody knows.

475
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,577
All right, here we go.

476
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,333
Boys to my right,
and girls to my left.

477
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,699
Mambo!
Mambo!

478
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,242
Go!

479
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,968
RIFF: Tony!

480
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,358
ALL: Mambo!

481
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,125
Mambo!

482
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,816
You're not thinking
I'm someone else?

483
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,568
I know you are not.

484
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,616
Or that we've met before?

485
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,244
I know we have not.

486
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,038
I felt...

487
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,958
I knew something
never before
was gonna happen...

488
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,042
...had to happen...

489
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,460
...but this is
so much more.

490
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,504
My hands are cold.

491
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,468
Yours, too.

492
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,769
So warm.

493
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,277
So beautiful.

494
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,612
Beautiful.

495
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,371
It's so much to believe.

496
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,041
You're not making a joke?

497
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,838
I have not yet learned
how to joke that way.

498
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,300
I think
now I never will.

499
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:27,920
Get your hands off,
American!

500
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,046
Nardo!

501
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,797
Stay away from my sister.
Sister?

502
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:31,965
Couldn't you see
he's one of them?

503
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,216
I saw only him.

504
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,427
They want one thing
from a Puerto Rican girl.

505
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,637
That's a lie!
Later, Tony!

506
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,430
Get away!
Don't listen.

507
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,599
She'll listen to her brother
before she listens
to you.

508
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,892
If you two want
to settle this...

509
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,770
Please, boys!
Everything was
going so well.

510
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:48,190
Now, come on! We're all here
to have a good time,
aren't we?

511
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,650
Nardo...

512
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,406
Take her out of here.
We're going home.

513
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,325
Nardo, it is
my first dance.

514
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,285
Please.
We are family.
Now go.

515
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,090
Come, Maria.

516
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,888
Maria.

517
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,521
I don't want you.

518
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,022
I want you, though.

519
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:42,202
I want you
for a war council.
Jets and Sharks.

520
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,204
The pleasure is mine.

521
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,831
Let's go outside.

522
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:49,292
I would not leave
the ladies here alone
with your kind around.

523
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,044
We will meet you
at midnight.

524
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:52,754
Doc's candy store?

525
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,006
Mmm-hmm.

526
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,174
And no jazz before then.

527
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,885
I understand the rules...

528
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,887
...native boy.

529
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,473
Ice.

530
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,772
Doc's at midnight.
Spread the word.

531
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,524
Right, daddy-o.

532
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:23,160

BERNARDO: Now,
I do not say these things
to spoil your evening...

564
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,984
...or to hear
myself talk.

565
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,652
I am here
longer than you, Maria.

566
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,778
Sí, Nardo.

567
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,615
Someday, when you're
an old married woman
with five kids...

568
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:10,202
...you can tell me what to do.
But right now it is
the other way around.

569
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,786
Now go to bed.

570
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,915
He's the old married woman.

571
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,673
You know,
she has a mother.
Also a father.

572
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,259
They do not know
this country any better
than she does.

573
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,679
And you do not know it at all.
Girls here are
free to have fun.

574
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,098
She is
in America now.

575
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,601
Puerto Rico
is in America now.

576
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:42,275
Sometimes I don't
know which is thicker,
your skull or your accent.

577
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,445
Aw...

578
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,948
BERNARDO: Vámonos, muchachos!

579
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,491
Let them wait.

580
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,784
Is Maria all right?

581
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,619
I should be
so all right.

582
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,828
It will not
happen again.

583
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,957
Pepe, Indio, after tonight,
things will be settled.

584
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,792
First settle
your stomach.

585
00:47:58,876 --> 00:47:59,876
Never mind my stomach.

586
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,797
I mind your nose
and your head broken.

587
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:04,881
Broken?

588
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:07,968
Sure!
They use Maria for an excuse
to start World War III.

589
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,552
It is more than that.

590
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,180
More than what?
She was only dancing.

591
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:15,141
With an American
who's really a Polack.

592
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,601
Says the Spic.

593
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:17,978
ALL: Ooh!

594
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,814
You are not so cute.

595
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:22,107
That Tony is.

596
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,358
And he works.

597
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,693
A delivery boy.

598
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,069
And what are you?

599
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,195
An assistant.

600
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,948
Sí, and Chino makes half
of what the Polack makes.

601
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,200
Here comes
the whole commercial!

602
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,577
Your mother's a Pole,
your father's a Swede...

603
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,871
But you were born here,
that's all that you need.

604
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:41,042
You are an American.
But us? Foreigners!

605
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,503
ALL: Lice! Cockroaches!

606
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,796
But it's true!

607
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:48,466
When I think of how
I thought it would be
for us here...

608
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,093
...we came like
children believing...

609
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,512
Trusting with
our hearts open!

610
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,556
With our arms open.

611
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,683
You came with
your mouth open.

612
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:00,103
You're the Spic,
and you go back
in handcuffs.

613
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,938
I'm going back
in a Cadillac.

614
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:03,940
Air-conditioned!
Built-in bar!

615
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,734
Telephone!
And television!

616
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,068
Compatible color.

617
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,864
If you had all that here,
why would you wanna go
back to Puerto Rico?

618
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,657
Or even if you
didn't have
all that here,

619
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:14,534
why would you
wanna go back there?

620
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,869
It's so good here?

621
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,287
It's so good there?

622
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,872
We had nothing!

623
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,709
We still have nothing,
only more expensive.

624
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,087
Anita Josefina.

625
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,214
ANITA: No.
It's plain Anita now.

626
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,799
Margarita, et cetera.

627
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,885
You leave me alone.
At least I let...

628
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,929
Once an immigrant,
always an immigrant!

629
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:38,016
Look! Instead of a shampoo,
she's been brainwashed!

630
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,142
Stop it!

631
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,520
She has given up Puerto Rico,
and now she's queer
for Uncle Sam.

632
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,064
No.

633
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:45,482
That's not true.

Sí.

816

What does Tony stand for?

818
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:12,978
Anton.

01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,494
Maybe they're
too chicken
to show.

829
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,121
We got time, A-Rab.

Captain Marvel.
Gee, I love him.

So marry him!

838
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,011
I ain't never gonna

You ain't never

Pow! Pow!

842
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,643
Wacko jacko!
Down goes a teenage hoodlum.

843
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,898
Gee, could a real zip gun
make you do like that?

844
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,234
No, the zip gun
could make you do.
You better wear diapers!

845
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,529
Go walk the streets
like your sister.

846
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,491
Listen, jailbait,
I licked you twice,
and I can do it again!

847
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,666
Come on, Anybodys,

848

JET 2: Riff's here.

849
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,753
Okay, cats, all present
and accounted for?

850
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,839
I'm really proud of you.
You did good at the dance.

851
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:04,924
So where are they?

852
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,176
Unwind, Action.
Any sign of Tony?

853
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,344
Invisible, man.

854
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:10,679
What do you think
the Sharks are gonna ask for?

855
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:11,764
Mercy.

856
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:12,973
Just rubber hoses maybe.

857
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:14,475
Relax, little man.

858
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,517
You tell him, daddy-o.

859
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:16,644
I'm ready.

Cracko jacko!

862
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:23,567
Riff, look, in a tight spot,
you're gonna need
every man you can get.

863
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:24,985
No.

864
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,487
An American tragedy.

865
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,530
Pow!
Poo.

866
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,369
Look, when the Sharks come,
you chicks cut out.

867
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,664
We might, and then again,
we might not.

868
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,458
This ain't kid stuff, Graziella.

869
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,920
I and Velma
ain't kid stuff neither.

870
01:04:43,255 --> 01:04:44,546
Are we, Vel?

871
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:46,006
No, thank you.

872
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:47,508
Ooh, obblee-ooh.

873
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,510
And you can punctuate it.

874
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,552
Ooh!

875
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,182
What are we poopin' around
with dumb broads?

876
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,226
I and Velma ain't dumb!

877
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:58,769
JET 3: The bulls!

878

KRUPKE: You.

Yes, sir.
I got 20-20 hearing.

886
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,080
Then why didn't
you answer me?

887
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,249
His mother told him
never answer back to a cop.

888
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,543
You little wise apple!
You want me to run you in?

889
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,169
Indeed not, sir.

890
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,672
I oughta run
all youse punks in.

891
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,591
What are ya
standin' around here for,
blockin' the sidewalks?

892
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:33,846
You see, sir,
we're afraid to go home.
It's such a bad environment.

893
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,431
We don't get no love there.

894
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:36,807
It's awful.

895
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,143
If you don't leave us
on the streets all night...

896
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:41,854
...we liable to
turn into a bunch of
juvenile delinquents.

897
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,357
Listen, I know youse guys
was cookin' up
somethin' at the dance.

898
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,693
So don't think you'll put
nothin' over on me.

899
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,862
Sergeant, come on, quick!
We got a 10-13.

900
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:52,031
Now, go on.
Get a move on,

901
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,616
And don't let me
catch none of youse
around here later.

902
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,493
I'll see you around.

903
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,203
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!

904
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:00,706
You forgot to say good-bye.

905
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,083
Them headbusters
ain't got no manners.

906
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,502
"And don't let me catch
none of youse here later!"

907
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,004
They treat us like
we ain't even human.

908
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,464
He was pretty mad.

909
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,841
So, what happened?
A big fat nothin', right?

910
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,801
Yeah, but suppose
he comes back...

911
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,845
...while we are
havin' the war council?

912
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,514
We'll snow him some more.
See, them cops...

913
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,809
...they believe everything
they read in the papers
about us JDs.

914
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,812
So that's what we give 'em,
somethin' to believe in.

915
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,147
You!

916

this child does not
need to have
his head shrunk at all.

986

Juvenile delinquency

Aren't you up
a little late,
Baby John?

1024
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,899
I got insomnia, Doc.
Too many worries.

1025
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,735
Any of you seen
Tony tonight?

1026
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:40,902
You betcha we did.

1027
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,738
DOC: He was supposed to
clean up the store.

1028
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,365
Maybe he decided
to clean up
the PRs instead.

1029
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,491
Tony?

1030
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,413
Doc, you ain't gonna
close up now.

1031
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,539
I'm not?

1032
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:54,207
Listen, we got
a war council here.

1033
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:55,375
A who?

1034
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,420
To determine weapons.
We gotta set up
a mix with the PRs.

1035
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,089
Weapons.
You couldn't play basketball?

1036
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:02,758
Get with it, buster.

1037
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,217
You don't understand.

1038
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,386
We got special business
comin' here tonight.

1039
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,096
Makin' trouble for
the Puerto Ricans?

1040
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,890
They make
trouble for us.

1041
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,725
For you,
trouble is a relief.

1042
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,436
We gotta stand up
to 'em, Doc.
It's important.

1043
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,981
Fightin' over
a little piece of street
is so important?

1044
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:19,107
To us, it is!

1045
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,150
To hoodlums, it is.

1046
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,276
Who you calling hoodlum?

1047
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:22,903
War council...
Don't start, Doc.

1048
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,780
Rumbles.
Why, when I was your age...

1049
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,406
When you was my age!

1050
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:29,284
When my old man was my age,
my brother was my age...

1051
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,912
You was never my age,
none of ya.

1052
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:35,415
And the sooner
you creeps get hip to that,
the sooner you'll dig us!

1053
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,126
I'll dig you an early grave,
that's what I'll dig.

1054
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,711
Dig, dig, dig!

1055
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,341
Okay, Doc, set 'em up.
Cokes all around.

1056
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:27,801
Let's get down
to business.

1057
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,971
So, Bernardo hasn't
learned the procedures
of gracious living.

1058
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,224
I don't like you,
either, so cut it.

1059
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,392
Okay, kick it, Doc.

1060
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,144
Boys, couldn't
you maybe talk...

1061
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:38,603
Kick it!

1062
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:58,248
We challenge you to a rumble.
All out, once and for all.
Accept?

1063
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,459
On what terms?

1064
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,419
Whatever terms
you're callin'.

1065
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,629
You crossed the line
once too often.

1066
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:05,922
You started it.

1067
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,215
Who jumped Baby John
this afternoon?

1068
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,134
Who jumped me
the first day
I moved here?

1069
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,136
Who asked you to move here?
Who asked you?

1070
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,637
Back where you came from.
Spics.

1071
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,222
Mick!
Wop!

1072
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,565
We accept.

1073
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,693
Time?
Tomorrow?

1074
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,653
After dark.

1075
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,241
RIFF: Place?

1076
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,326
The park?

1077
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,288
The river.

1078
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,211
Under the highway.

1079
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:49,132
Weapons?

1080
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,509
Doc! Doc!

1081
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:51,968
RIFF: Tony!

1082
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:55,514
Weapons!

1083
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,350
Weapons.

1084
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,684
You call.

1085
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:00,977
Your challenge.

1086
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,563
RIFF: Afraid to call?

1087
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:09,319
Rocks.

1088
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,112
Belts.

1089
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,240
Pipes.
Cans.

1090
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:14,950
Bricks.
Bats.

1091
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,117
Clubs.
Chains.

1092
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,036
Bottles, knives, guns!

1093
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:20,330
What a coop
full of chickens.

1094
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,123
Who are you
callin' chicken?

1095
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,416
Every dog
knows his own.

1096
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:24,793
I'm calling
you all chicken!

1097
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:28,713
Big, tough buddy boys
gotta throw bricks.
Afraid to get in close?

1098
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,341
Afraid to slug it out?
Afraid to use plain skin?

1099
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,552
Not even garbage?
That ain't a rumble.

1100
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,428
Who says?
You said call weapons.

1101
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,265
A rumble
can be clinched
by a fair fight,

1102
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,392
if you've got
the guts to risk that.

1103
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,144
Best man from each gang
to slug it out.

1104
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,523
I would enjoy
to risk that.

1105
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,358
Okay. Fair fight.

1106
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,403
Wait a minute!
The commanders
say yes or no.

1107
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,323
Fair fight.

1108
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:01,955
When I get through with you,
you will be like
a fish after skinning.

1109
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,666
Your best man
fights our best man.

1110
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,794
And we pick him.

1111
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,213
But I thought I
would be fighting with...

1112
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:11,923
You shook on it.

1113
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,178
Yes. I shook on it.

1114
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:18,847
Look, Bernardo,
if you wanna
change your mind...

1115
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,027
RIFF: Bernardo, baby,
would you like a cigarette?

1116
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,613
No, thank you.
I don't smoke.

1117
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:36,781
Hey.

1118
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,577
Evening, Lieutenant.

1119
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,079
I and Tony was
just closing up.

1120
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:48,460
Now, this is
more like it, fellas.

1121
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:51,046
Warms me all over
to see you this way.

1122
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,757
And after only
a couple of words from me
at the playground.

1123
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:55,383
How about that?

1124
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,760
Do you mind?

1125
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:59,638
I have no mind.
I'm the village idiot.

1126
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:04,643
You know, headquarters
hears about this,
I may even get a promotion.

1127
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:08,146
Good deal all around,
Bernardo?

1128
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,357
I get a promotion...

1129
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,860
...and you Puerto Ricans
get what you've
been itchin' for...

1130
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,863
...use of the playground,
use of the gym...

1131
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:19,366
...the streets,
the candy store.

1132
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:23,995
So what if they do
turn this whole town
into a stinkin' pigsty?

1133
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:27,916
Don't stop him!
He wants to get home,
write letters to San Juan...

1134
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,168
...tell 'em how
he's got it
made over here!

1135
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:35,006
What I mean is,
clear out, you!
I said, clear out!

1136
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,679
Yeah, sure, I know.

1137
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:45,725
It's a free country,
and I ain't got the right.
But I got a badge.

1138
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,353
What do you got?

1139
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:51,940
Things are tough all over.
Beat it!

1140
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:25,473
Okay, fellas...

1141
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,769
...where's
the rumble gonna be?

1142
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,480
Come on!

1143
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,607
Regular Americans
don't rub with
the gold teeth unless...

1144
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:35,692
Lieutenant...

1145
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:36,985
You shut your mouth!

1146
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,906
Come on, Baby John.

1147
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:45,535
Before that smooth
little kisser of yours
gets cut up for life.

1148
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:47,245
Now, where's it gonna be?

1149
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,330
The river?

1150
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:51,041
The park?

1151
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,172
Look, fellas,
I'm for you.

1152
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:00,341
I want this beat cleaned up,
and you can do it for me.

1153
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:05,263
I'll even lend a hand
if things get rough.
Now, where you gonna rumble?

1154
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:09,726
The playground?

1155
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,480
Sweeney's lot?

1156
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:22,864
Why don't you get smart,
you stupid hooligans?

1157
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:26,034
I ought to take
you to the station and
throw you in the can now!

1158
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:29,287
You and the tinhorn
immigrant scum
you come from!

1159
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,292
How's your old man's DTs,
A-Rab?

1160
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:40,006
How's the action
on your mother's side
of the street, Action?

1161
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,718
One of these days,
there won't be
anybody to hold you.

1162
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:46,805
Get him out of here!
Come on! Beat it! Go!

1163
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,016
Don't worry!
I'll find out
where it's gonna be.

1164
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:54,145
So be sure to
finish each other off,
because if you don't, I will!

1165
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:05,323
Yeah, sure.

1166
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,200
Understand them.

1167
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:09,702
That's what they
keep telling me
down at headquarters.

1168
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:11,621
"Understand."

1169
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:15,959
Well, you try
keeping hoodlums in line,
and see what it does to you.

1170
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,340
It wouldn't give me
a mouth like his.

1171
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,929
Come on, Doc.

1172
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:29,347
Don't let it get you.

1173
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,307
I'm sick.

1174
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:33,643
You heard.
It's gonna be
a fair fight.

1175
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,895
And that's gonna
cure somethin'?

1176
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:39,649
From here on in,
everything's
gonna be all right.

1177
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:41,401
Got a feelin'.

1178
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:42,777
What have you
been takin' tonight?

1179
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:46,197
A trip to the moon!
And I'll tell you
a secret, Doc.

1180
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,701
It ain't a man
that's up there.
It's a girl.

1181
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,828
A lady.

1182
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:56,374
Buenas noches, señor.

1183
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,042
Buenas noches?

1184
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:02,046
So that's why
you made it a fair fight.

1185
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,048
I'm gonna see her tomorrow,
and I can't wait.

1186
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:07,594
Tony!
Things aren't tough enough?

1187
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,220
Tough? Doc, I'm in love!

1188
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:10,388
And you're not frightened?

1189
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:11,890
Should I be?

1190
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,559
No.

1191
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,646
No, I'm frightened enough
for the both of you.

1192
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,903
What has Chino
done to her?

1193
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,364
Chino? Why Chino?

1194
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:18,409
Maybe she's just
dolling up for us.
Gracias, querida.

1195
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:23,289
Rosalia, Consuelo,
my adorable friends,
can you keep a secret?

1196
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:25,124
I'm hot for secrets.

1197
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:28,836
No. I won't tell you.

1198
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:30,963
What?
"What?"

1199
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,882
The poor girl is
out of her mind.

1200
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,425
I am! Crazy.

1201
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,595
She might be at that.
She looks
somehow different.

1202
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,013
I do?

1203
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:40,848
And I think she
is up to something.

1204
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,350
I am?

1205
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:45,520
CONSUELO: "I do? I am?"
She talks like a parrot.

1206
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:46,687

where I can't hear it.

1280
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,243
Go now. Go home.
It's closing time. Shoo!

1281
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,579
ALL:
Buenas noches, Madam Lucia.

1282
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,082
You put down the shades?
Yes.

1283
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,459
Turn off the lights,
and lock the doors.

1284
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:58,129
Buenas noches, Anita.

1285
01:26:58,255 --> 01:26:59,589
Buenas noches.

1286
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,757
MARIA: Adiós.

1287
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,467
The jail is open.

1288
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,261
I thought
she'd never leave.

1289
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:07,388
It's hard to believe
that old bag of a witch

1290
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:09,557
was once
a young bag like us.

1291
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:12,351
Let's go before
she changes her mind
and comes back.

1292
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:15,229
You go, querida.
I will lock up.

1293
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,606
ANITA: Why?

1294
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:17,773
I have work.

1295
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:19,317
ANITA: Do it tomorrow.

1296
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:20,901
I'm in no hurry.

1297
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:22,153
I am!

1298
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:25,615
I'm going home now
and take a nice,
long bubble bath.

1299
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:27,658
Black orchid.

1300
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,327
Black orchid?

1301
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:31,454
All over.

1302
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,165
I gotta date with Nardo
after the rumble.

1303
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,167
What rumble?

1304
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,502
Oh, well, um...

1305
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:41,714
Nardo's Sharks
and those boys
at the dance.

1306
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,175
They fight each other tonight?

1307
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,344
They don't play patsy.

1308
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:50,848
Why must they always fight?

1309
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:54,810
You saw how they dance,
like they gotta get
rid of something quick.

1310
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:56,771
That's how they fight.

1311
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,856
To get rid of what?

1312
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:02,818
Too much feeling.
And they
do get rid of it.

1313
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:06,614
Boy, after a fight,
that brother of yours
is so healthy.

1314
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:09,617
Definitely black orchid.

1315
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,797
Buenas noches.

1316
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:27,176
"You go, querida.
I will lock up."

1317
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:31,889
It's too early for noches.

1318
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:33,599
Buenas tardes.

1319
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:35,726
Gracias...

1320
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:38,354
...buenas tardes.

1321
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:41,524
He just came
from the drugstore
to deliver aspirin.

1322
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:42,983
You'll need it.

1323
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,695
Not us. We're fine.

1324
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:47,571
We're out of the world.

1325
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,198
You're out of your heads.

1326
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,409
We're 12 feet in the air.

1327
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,077
Anita can see that.

1328
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,875
You will not tell?

1329
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:04,630
Tell what?

1330
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:07,550
How can I know
what goes on 12 feet
over my head?

1331
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:12,555
You better be home in 15 minutes.

1332
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,816
It's all right.
She likes us.

1333
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,861
But she is worried,
and so am I.

1334
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:28,320
That's foolish.

1335
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:30,114
Are you going to
that rumble tonight?

1336
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,991
- No.
- Yes!

1337
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:33,659
Why?

1338
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:34,994
You must go and stop it.

1339
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:38,789
I have stopped it.
It'll only be a fistfight
between two of 'em. Nardo...

1340
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:41,000
Any fight is no good for us.

1341
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,043
Everything is good for us.
We got magic.

1342
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,045
Listen and hear me.

1343
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:47,840
You must go and stop it.

1344
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,093
It means that much to you?

1345
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:52,261
Yes.

1346
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,889
All right, I will, then.

1347
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,141
I believe you.

1348
01:29:57,601 --> 01:29:58,768
You do have magic.

1349
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:00,102
Of course.

1350
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:03,063
I've got you.

1351
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:07,318
And tonight,
after I stop the rumble
that isn't a rumble...

1352
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:08,444
...I'll come by for you.

1353
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:10,446
I will wait for you on the roof.

1354
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:11,864
No.

1355
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:13,449
Not the roof.

1356
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,409
I'll come to your house.

1357
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:18,078
You cannot. My mama.

1358
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,707
Then I'll take you to my house.

1359
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,167
Your mama?

1360
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:28,380
She'll come runnin'
from the kitchen
to welcome you.

1361
01:30:28,465 --> 01:30:29,882
She lives in the kitchen.

1362
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:31,467
Dressed so elegant?

1363
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:35,221
I told her you were coming.
She'll look at your face.
Try not to smile.

1364
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:38,933
She'll say,
"Skinny, but pretty."

1365
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:42,102
She is plump, no doubt?

1366
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:43,854
Fat.

1367
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:47,233
I take after my mama.
Delicate-boned.

1368
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:48,442
Oh?

1369
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,571
Not in front of Mama!

1370
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:54,323
Oh...

1371
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:57,326
I would like to see Papa in this.

1372
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,245
Mama will make him
ask about your prospects.

1373
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:00,412
Many.

1374
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:01,705
If you go to church.

1375
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:03,082
Always.

1376
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:07,419
Yes, Papa might like you.

1377
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,465
May I have your daughter's hand?

1378
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:13,259
He says, "Yes."

1379
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:15,636
Gracias.

1380
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:17,847
And your mama?

1381
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,431
I'm afraid to ask her.

1382
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:23,686
Tell her she's not
getting a daughter.
She's getting rid of a son.

1383
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:27,648
She says, "Yes!"

1384
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,525
She has good taste.

1385
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:32,653
Here. Maid of honor.

1386
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:35,322
That color is bad for Anita.

1387
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:36,532
The best man!

1388
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:38,242
That is my papa!

1389
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,245
Sorry, Papa.

1390
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:45,916
Here we go, Riff.
Womb to tomb.

1391
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:50,045
Now, you see, Anita?
There was nothing to worry about.

1392
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:55,634
Look! Mama's crying already.

1393
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:30,961
I, Anton...

1394
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:33,213
...take thee, Maria...

1395
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:36,342
I, Maria,
take thee, Anton...

1396
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,637
For richer,
for poorer...

1397
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:42,306
In sickness
and in health...

1398
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:45,976
To love
and to honor...

1399
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:48,896
To hold
and to keep...

1400
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:52,942
From each sun
to each moon...

1401
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,403
From tomorrow
to tomorrow...

1402
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:00,491
From now to forever...

1403
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,953
Till death do us part.

1404
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,835
With this ring,
I thee wed.

1405
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,548
With this ring...

1406
01:33:17,384 --> 01:33:19,218
...I thee wed.

1407
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:25,265

01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:49,941
For what?

1484
01:39:52,362 --> 01:39:54,237
That's the way
it's done, buddy boy.

1485
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:56,907
More gracious living?

1486
01:39:57,617 --> 01:40:00,535
Look, every one of you
hates every one of us, and
we hate you right back.

1487
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,828
Let's get at it.

1488
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:03,830
Sure.
Here we go.

1489
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,548
JET 1:
Let's get in there...

1490
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:14,925
JET 2: Come on, Ice.

1491
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:16,760
JET 3: Come on, Ice,
come on!

1492
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,765
JET 4: Keep your eyes open!

1493
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:24,684
Hold it!

1494
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:30,273
Tony! Get with the gang.
It's all okay.

1495
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:31,441
No!

1496
01:40:31,818 --> 01:40:32,901
Tony, what are you doing?

1497
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:35,654
Maybe he has found the guts
to fight his own battles.

1498
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:41,618
It don't take guts if you got a
battle. We ain't got one. None of us.

1499
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:43,954
- Okay, Nardo?
- Tony!

1500
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,666
Hold it!
Now, let's just cool it.

1501
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:50,293
The deal is, a fair fight
between you and Ice.

1502
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:52,254
Come on,
get with the gang.

1503
01:40:52,338 --> 01:40:54,089
Mother hen
protecting the little one?

1504
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:55,549
I'll give you a battle.

1505
01:40:55,633 --> 01:40:56,800
You've got one!

1506
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:59,219
I'll take pretty boy
as a warm-up.

1507
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,431
Afraid, pretty boy?
Afraid, gutless?

1508
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:04,349
- Afraid, chicken?
- Cut it!

1509
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:05,809
No!

1510
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:08,895
I don't wanna, Bernardo.

1511
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,147
I'm sure.

1512
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:11,940
- Now, listen to me.
- Are you chicken?

1513
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:13,108
There's no need
to fight.

1514
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:14,234
The hell there ain't!

1515
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:15,277
You've got it wrong!

1516
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:16,403
Chicken!

1517
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:19,364
Why can't you understand?

1518
01:41:19,449 --> 01:41:20,657
Understand, chicken!

1519
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:21,825
Get out of here!

1520
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:22,909
Kill him, Tony!

1521
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,244
Come on!

1522
01:41:25,204 --> 01:41:26,329
Afraid to fight?

1523
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:27,914
Come on.

1524
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,332
Let me see you fight.

1525
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:30,834
Chicken boy!

1526
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:32,210
Hey!

1527
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:34,004
He is chicken!

1528
01:41:34,714 --> 01:41:35,922
Pretty boy.
Listen to him!

1529
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:40,177
Don't! Stop it!
We got nothin'
to fight about.

1530
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:41,928
Bernardo!

1531
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:43,096
Yellow-bellied chicken!

1532
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:44,431
Don't push me!

1533
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,099
Come on,
you yellow-bellied Polack!

1534
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,782
TONY: Riff!
What are you doin'?

1535
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:04,117
Get outta here, Tony!

1536
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:05,368
Riff, don't!

1537
01:42:05,912 --> 01:42:07,204
Hold him!

1538
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:09,372
Let me go!

1539
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:20,884
Riff, don't!

1540
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:35,232
RIFF: Keep outta this!

1541
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:38,235
TONY: Somebody stop him!

1542
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:39,819
Let me go!

1543
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:41,821
Ice!

1544
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:43,531
Tiger!

1545
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:10,558
Riff!

1546
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:18,817
SHARK 1: Come on, Nardo!
TONY: Stop him!

1547
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:23,029
Riff, don't!

1548
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:47,679
SHARK 2: Nardo!

1549
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:54,644
JET: Get them!

1550
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:27,237
Maria!

1551
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:39,249
Tony, come on!
Come on, Tony!

1552
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,584
We gotta get out of here!
Come on!

1553
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:47,298
Come on, Tony!
Come on!

1554
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:49,092
Get outta here!

1555
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:02,272
Come on!

1556
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:09,904
Come on, Tony!

1557
01:46:33,512 --> 01:46:34,512
MAN: Hey!

1558
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:36,764
Wait for me, Rosa.

1559
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:45,458
Chino!

1560
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:48,711
There was no one downstairs.

1561
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:51,548
My mother and father
are at the store.

1562
01:47:51,632 --> 01:47:52,632
I didn't expect
you to come by.

1563
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,509
- I would have waited down...
- Maria.

1564
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:57,220
You have been fighting, Chino?

1565
01:47:57,429 --> 01:47:58,555
Yes.

1566
01:47:58,639 --> 01:47:59,931
I am sorry.

1567
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:01,391
That is not like you.

1568
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:03,017
No.

1569
01:48:03,143 --> 01:48:04,686
You must go home and wash up.

1570
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:06,229
I will see you tomorrow.

1571
01:48:06,313 --> 01:48:07,647
Maria, at the rumble...

1572
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:08,815
There was no rumble.

1573
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:09,983
There was.

1574
01:48:10,067 --> 01:48:11,484
- No. You are wrong.
- There was.

1575
01:48:11,569 --> 01:48:13,695
Nobody meant for it to happen.

1576
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:20,577
Tell me.

1577
01:48:22,246 --> 01:48:23,580
It is bad.

1578
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:26,165
Very bad?

1579
01:48:28,377 --> 01:48:29,711
You see...

1580
01:48:33,299 --> 01:48:36,092
It will be easier
if you say it very fast.

1581
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:38,928
There was a fight.

1582
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:41,723
And Nardo...

1583
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:44,100
Somehow a knife...

1584
01:48:45,227 --> 01:48:46,811
And Nardo
and someone, they...

1585
01:48:46,895 --> 01:48:48,104
Tony.

1586
01:48:49,398 --> 01:48:51,274
What happened to Tony?

1587
01:48:52,693 --> 01:48:55,778
Chino, tell me!
Is Tony all right?

1588
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:00,783
He killed your brother!

1589
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,584
You are lying.

1590
01:49:10,878 --> 01:49:12,962
Chino, why do you lie to me?

1591
01:49:17,301 --> 01:49:19,761
Chino, true, you are lying!
Why?

1592
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:21,763
Why do you lie to me, Chino?

1593
01:49:23,265 --> 01:49:24,599
CHILD: Mama! Mama!

1594
01:49:24,683 --> 01:49:26,643
Bernardo está muerto!

1595
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:28,728
WOMAN: Bernardo, muerto?

1596
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:29,979
No!

1597
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:41,449
Santa María,
make it not be true.
Please make it not be true.

1598
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:45,787
Madre de Dios,
I will do anything.
Make me die!

1599
01:49:46,121 --> 01:49:48,456
Only, please,
make it not be true.

1600
01:49:52,795 --> 01:49:54,379
Make it not be...

1601
01:49:59,218 --> 01:50:01,803
Killer! Killer!
Killer! Killer!

1602
01:50:08,352 --> 01:50:10,103
I tried to stop it.

1603
01:50:11,814 --> 01:50:12,980
I did try.

1604
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:17,068
I don't know what went wrong.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't wanna.

1605
01:50:17,194 --> 01:50:19,404
But Riff's like my brother...

1606
01:50:19,488 --> 01:50:23,282
...when Bernardo killed him,
Bernardo didn't meant it either.

1607
01:50:26,704 --> 01:50:28,413
I thought you knew.

1608
01:50:32,918 --> 01:50:35,253
I didn't come to tell you that.

1609
01:50:36,046 --> 01:50:38,798
Just for you to forgive me,
so I can go to the police.

1610
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:39,841
No!

1611
01:50:39,925 --> 01:50:41,008
It'll be easy now.

1612
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:42,802
- I won't let you!
- I must.

1613
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:44,095
Stay! Stay with me.

1614
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:45,805
Maria, I love you so much!

1615
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:47,140
Don't leave me!

1616
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:48,975
Whatever you want, I'll do.

1617
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:50,143
Hold me!

1618
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:51,519
Forever!

1619
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,104
Tighter.

1620
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:57,483
It'll be all right. I know it.
We're really together now.

1621
01:50:58,193 --> 01:50:59,777
But it's not us.

1622
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:03,698
It's everything around us.

1623
01:51:04,908 --> 01:51:08,369
Then I'll take you away,
where nothing can get to us.

1624
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:12,415
Not anyone or anything.

Baby John,
what are you doin' here?

1653
01:53:59,249 --> 01:54:00,541
Nothin'.

1654
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:03,586
What are you doin'
nothin' here for?
Come on.

1655
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:07,298
I don't want the guys
to see me, A-Rab.

1656
01:54:07,758 --> 01:54:09,008
Why not?

1657
01:54:09,885 --> 01:54:11,510
I'm cryin'.

1658
01:54:12,804 --> 01:54:14,055
You are?

1659
01:54:16,058 --> 01:54:17,308
What for?

1660
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:19,852
I don't know.
I'm just...

1661
01:54:19,937 --> 01:54:21,270
Blow your nose.

1662
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:28,402
A-Rab?

1663
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:29,695
Yeah?

1664
01:54:30,197 --> 01:54:32,657
Did you get
a look at their faces?

1665
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:35,701
Which faces?

1666
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:36,827
You know...

1667
01:54:37,412 --> 01:54:39,789
At the rumble.
Riff and Bernardo.

1668
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:42,166
Yeah.

1669
01:54:45,837 --> 01:54:47,797
I wish it was yesterday.

1670
01:54:47,923 --> 01:54:49,882
Me, too. I'm scared.

1671
01:54:49,967 --> 01:54:51,884
Cut it out.
You hear me? Cut it out!

1672
01:54:51,969 --> 01:54:53,344
A-Rab, what are we gonna do?

1673
01:54:53,428 --> 01:54:56,305
We'll meet
the other guys and form up.
That's what we'll do.

1674
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,431
Now, come on.
Let's go.

1675
01:54:57,557 --> 01:54:58,599
Hey.

1676
01:54:59,267 --> 01:55:01,102
You got a handkerchief first?

1677
01:55:01,186 --> 01:55:02,853
What's wrong with your sleeve?

1678
01:55:31,216 --> 01:55:32,675
Where you been?

1679
01:55:32,843 --> 01:55:34,301
Where do you think,
the Stork Club?

1680
01:55:34,386 --> 01:55:35,386
We thought they nabbed you.

1681
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:36,429
Go on.

1682
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:37,763
You didn't see Tony?

1683
01:55:37,848 --> 01:55:39,181
Nothin' but coppers.

1684
01:55:39,516 --> 01:55:40,766
What's wrong with him?

1685
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:43,019
There's nothin' wrong.
He's okay, you get it?

1686
01:55:43,103 --> 01:55:44,603
All right,
all right!

1687
01:55:44,688 --> 01:55:45,688
Maybe we oughta go home.

1688
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:46,856
For what?

1689
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:48,858
- Betcha they got him.
- Not Tony.

1690
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:51,193
Man, he was great,
right, Baby John?

1691
01:55:51,528 --> 01:55:52,778
Yeah.

1692
01:55:52,863 --> 01:55:54,780
He really come through
for the Jets.

1693
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:56,866
Just like Riff said he...

1694
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:00,953
Said he would.

1695
01:56:05,709 --> 01:56:07,543
I want Riff!

1696
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:10,880
Come on, Graziella.

1697
01:56:13,091 --> 01:56:15,593
Nobody was
supposed to get killed.

1698
01:56:16,762 --> 01:56:18,095
It just...

1699
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,269
They're gonna pay!

1700
01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:26,395
Them stinkin' Sharks.

1701
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:27,563
Dirty fighting.

1702
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:28,647
They started it!

1703
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:31,484
So why don't we finish it?
We gotta show 'em who's on top.

1704
01:56:31,568 --> 01:56:32,985
The Jets!
Let's do it now!

1705
01:56:33,111 --> 01:56:34,528
Ain't we had enough?

1706
01:56:34,613 --> 01:56:36,155
What's the matter, you scared?

1707
01:56:36,281 --> 01:56:37,823
Who you callin' scared?

1708
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:39,658
Lay off of him.
Mind your own business.

1709
01:56:39,743 --> 01:56:41,077
Don't sound off
on me. I'll...

1710
01:56:41,161 --> 01:56:42,411
You'll do what?

1711
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:43,662
Knock it off!

1712
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:49,085
Shut up down there,
you dirty bunch
of good-for-nothings!

1713
01:56:49,169 --> 01:56:50,586
Go home where you belong!

1714
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:53,380
Who you callin'
good-for-nothin',
you loudmouth crud head?

1715
01:56:53,465 --> 01:56:55,508
Come down, I'll put
this through your face!

1716
01:56:55,592 --> 01:56:56,842
Get inside!
All of you!

1717
01:56:56,927 --> 01:56:58,177
Come on!

1718
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:04,975
ICE: Shut up!

1719
01:57:05,102 --> 01:57:06,352
I don't have to
take that from nobody!

1720
01:57:06,436 --> 01:57:09,355
Next creep who sounds on me,
I swear the next guy...

1721
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:10,940
You'll laugh!

1722
01:57:16,613 --> 01:57:17,738
Yeah.

1723
01:57:18,782 --> 01:57:21,784
Now, you all better
dig this and dig it good!

1724
01:57:22,244 --> 01:57:24,912
No matter who
or what is eatin' you...

1725
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:27,665
...man, you show it,
and you are dead!

1726
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:32,378
You are cuttin'
a hole in yourselves

1727
01:57:32,462 --> 01:57:34,630
for them to stick in
a red-hot umbrella...

1728

...and open it wide!

1729

Okay.

1773
02:02:03,358 --> 02:02:04,608
Let's go.

1774
02:02:08,696 --> 02:02:09,696
Bop!

1775
02:02:10,407 --> 02:02:31,176
Pow!

1776
02:02:44,649 --> 02:02:45,858
Where we goin'?

1777
02:02:45,942 --> 02:02:48,235
If we lay low, the coppers
are gonna smell fish.

1778
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:49,445
So the first thing
we do...

1779
02:02:49,529 --> 02:02:50,696
ANYBODYS: Buddy boy!

1780
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:52,448
Go wear a skirt.

1781
02:02:52,574 --> 02:02:54,199
I got scabby knees.
Listen...

1782
02:02:54,284 --> 02:02:57,035
First, start showing around
like we got nothin' to hide.

1783
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:58,829
Suppose they ask
us about the rumble.

1784
02:02:58,913 --> 02:03:00,038
Supposin' they ask you
where's Tony

1785
02:03:00,123 --> 02:03:03,041
and what party's
lookin' for him
with a gun!

1786
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:04,793
ICE: You know somethin'?

1787
02:03:04,961 --> 02:03:06,795
I know I gotta
go get a skirt.

1788
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,005
Come on, Anybodys!

1789
02:03:08,089 --> 02:03:10,007
- What's the freak know?
- Plenty!

1790
02:03:10,091 --> 02:03:12,718
I figured somebody
oughta infiltrate
PR territory...

1791
02:03:12,802 --> 02:03:13,927
...and spy around.

1792
02:03:14,012 --> 02:03:16,096
I'm very large
with shadows, you know.

1793
02:03:16,181 --> 02:03:18,765
I can slip in and out of 'em
like wind through a fence.

1794
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:20,476
Boy, is she ever
makin' the most of it.

1795
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,269
You bet
your fat "A," I am!

1796
02:03:22,353 --> 02:03:23,979
- Spill it!
- Okay.

1797
02:03:24,063 --> 02:03:26,023
I hear Chino tellin'
the Sharks somethin'

1798
02:03:26,149 --> 02:03:28,150
about Tony
and Bernardo's sister.

1799
02:03:28,234 --> 02:03:29,735
And then I hear Chino say,

1800
02:03:29,819 --> 02:03:32,654
"If it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna get that Polack."

1801
02:03:32,739 --> 02:03:34,406
And then he pulls out
the bad news!

1802
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:35,782
BABY JOHN: Gee!

1803
02:03:35,867 --> 02:03:37,075
Them PRs won't stop.

1804
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:38,160
Till we stop 'em.

1805
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:39,328
Hold it!

1806
02:03:39,787 --> 02:03:40,996
Now, listen...

1807
02:03:41,414 --> 02:03:44,666
...Tony come through for us.
We gotta come through for Tony.

1808
02:03:44,876 --> 02:03:46,418
We gotta find him
before Chino finds him.

1809
02:03:46,503 --> 02:03:47,544
And burns him.

1810
02:03:47,629 --> 02:03:49,796
You cover the river!
Snowboy, get over to Doc's.

1811
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:51,173
I'll take the alleys.

1812
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:52,591
We'll take the streets.

1813
02:03:52,675 --> 02:03:53,842
The park.
The schoolyard.

1814
02:03:53,927 --> 02:03:55,260
We'll take the playground.

1815
02:03:55,345 --> 02:03:56,678
What about me?

1816
02:03:58,097 --> 02:04:00,682
You?
In and out
of the shadows.

1817
02:04:00,934 --> 02:04:02,309
Maybe you'll find
Tony in one of them.

1818
02:04:02,435 --> 02:04:03,769
Right!

1819
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:05,020
Hey!

1820
02:04:07,315 --> 02:04:09,274
You done good,
buddy boy.

1821
02:04:10,193 --> 02:04:12,986
Thanks, daddy-o.

1822
02:05:16,217 --> 02:05:17,426
Who is...

1823
02:05:20,805 --> 02:05:21,972
Maria.

1824
02:05:25,518 --> 02:05:26,518
Maria?

1825
02:05:27,687 --> 02:05:29,896
Maria, it's Anita.
You in there?

1826
02:05:30,982 --> 02:05:32,816
- Maria?
- Yes.

1827
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,901
Open the door.
I need you.

1828
02:05:36,696 --> 02:05:37,779
No.

1829
02:05:43,286 --> 02:05:44,703
Now you are afraid, too?

1830
02:05:44,829 --> 02:05:46,246
What?

1831
02:05:46,331 --> 02:05:48,040
I'll be right there.

1832
02:05:54,213 --> 02:05:55,213
Together.

1833
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:56,381
But where?

1834
02:05:57,467 --> 02:06:00,385
The bus station.
We'll go so far away,
they'll never find us.

1835
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:01,553
How can we?

1836
02:06:01,638 --> 02:06:03,388
Doc will help us.
I'll get money from him.

1837
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:04,598
You'll meet me at his store.

1838
02:06:04,682 --> 02:06:05,724
At Doc's, yes.

1839
02:06:05,808 --> 02:06:07,351
- I'll wait for you there.
- All right.

1840
02:06:07,435 --> 02:06:08,435
ANITA: Maria!

1841
02:06:08,519 --> 02:06:09,603
Yes.

1842
02:06:11,314 --> 02:06:12,397
Hurry!

1843
02:06:12,482 --> 02:06:14,149

1844
02:06:14,567 --> 02:06:15,942
Coming, Anita.

1845
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:27,663
Anita.

1846
02:06:39,467 --> 02:06:40,592
Oh...

1847
02:06:42,345 --> 02:06:44,513
All right, now you know.

1848
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:46,807
And you still don't know.

1849
02:06:46,891 --> 02:06:48,308
He is one of them!

1850
02:06:48,393 --> 02:06:49,393

I heard the boys talking.

1915
02:10:59,310 --> 02:11:00,936
He's hunting for Tony.

I know.

1921
02:11:14,033 --> 02:11:15,575
I loved Bernardo.

1922
02:11:23,834 --> 02:11:24,834
SCHRANK: Anybody home?

Yes.

02:11:29,674 --> 02:11:31,466
She isn't feeling well.

1926
02:11:32,009 --> 02:11:33,218
Who is?

1927
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:37,305
Hello, miss.

1928
02:11:37,932 --> 02:11:41,101
I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't like to
disturb you at a time like this...

1929
02:11:41,185 --> 02:11:44,562
Yes, a very bad time.
You'll excuse me, please.

1930
02:11:44,647 --> 02:11:46,231
I have a couple of
questions to ask.

1931
02:11:46,315 --> 02:11:47,899
Afterwards, please.

1932
02:11:48,234 --> 02:11:49,401
I must go to my brother now.

1933
02:11:49,485 --> 02:11:50,652
Now, just one minute!

1934
02:11:50,736 --> 02:11:52,654
- Can't you wait?
- No!

1935
02:11:54,657 --> 02:11:55,824
Now.

1936
02:11:55,992 --> 02:11:57,492
You were at
the dance last night...

1937
02:11:57,576 --> 02:11:59,244
Will this take very long?

1938
02:11:59,370 --> 02:12:01,079
As long as it has to.

1939
02:12:02,498 --> 02:12:03,832
Excuse me.

1940
02:12:05,167 --> 02:12:07,585
Anita, my headache is much worse.

1941
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:09,504
Will you go to
Doc's store for me?

1942
02:12:09,630 --> 02:12:11,423
Don't you people
keep aspirin around?

1943
02:12:11,507 --> 02:12:13,550
This is something special.

1944
02:12:15,386 --> 02:12:17,387
Will you go for me, Anita?

1945
02:12:23,310 --> 02:12:25,061
What shall I ask for?

1946
02:12:26,188 --> 02:12:27,689
Doc will know.

1947
02:12:28,357 --> 02:12:32,902
Tell him I have been detained and
can't get there right away...

1948
02:12:33,529 --> 02:12:36,239
...or I would have
picked it up myself.

1949
02:12:46,709 --> 02:12:49,085
Excuse me.
You were asking?

1950
02:12:51,130 --> 02:12:52,213
Yeah.

1951
02:12:52,965 --> 02:12:56,134
At the gym last night,
your brother got
into a heavy argument...

1952
02:12:56,218 --> 02:12:59,054
...because you danced
with the wrong boy.

1953
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:02,223
Yes.

1954
02:13:02,391 --> 02:13:03,767
Who was the boy?

1955
02:13:05,061 --> 02:13:07,020
Another from my country.

1956
02:13:07,938 --> 02:13:09,397
And his name?

1957
02:13:10,274 --> 02:13:11,399
José.

1958
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:22,869
ACTION: Can't find him.
He ain't nowhere.

1959
02:13:22,953 --> 02:13:24,329
He's down there
in the cellar.

1960
02:13:24,413 --> 02:13:25,538
- Tony?
- Safe and sound.

1961
02:13:25,623 --> 02:13:26,748
I found him.

1962
02:13:26,916 --> 02:13:27,999
You warn him about Chino?

1963
02:13:28,084 --> 02:13:29,667
What's he doin' in the cellar?

1964
02:13:29,794 --> 02:13:31,419
Keepin' the mice company, stupid.

1965
02:13:31,712 --> 02:13:32,962
No sign of Chino?

1966
02:13:33,047 --> 02:13:34,047
Nothin'.

1967
02:13:34,131 --> 02:13:35,215
His luck.

1968
02:13:35,299 --> 02:13:37,425
I'll slip out back and
check the alleys again.

1969
02:13:37,510 --> 02:13:38,551
You guys hang here.

1970
02:13:38,636 --> 02:13:39,677
Right.

1971
02:13:39,762 --> 02:13:41,513
BABY JOHN: Boy,
I'm thirsty. Where's Doc?

1972
02:13:41,597 --> 02:13:44,057
Upstairs raising
getaway money for Tony.

1973
02:13:44,141 --> 02:13:45,433
Doc ain't got no money.

1974
02:13:45,518 --> 02:13:46,559
His mattress has.

1975
02:13:46,644 --> 02:13:49,521
Come on. Cut the frabberjabber.
Grab some readin' matter.

1976
02:13:49,605 --> 02:13:51,439
Play the juke.
Some of you get outside.

1977
02:13:51,524 --> 02:13:54,234
If you see Chino
or those stinkin' PRs comin...

1978
02:14:05,746 --> 02:14:06,955
I'd like to see Doc.

1979
02:14:07,081 --> 02:14:08,289
He ain't here.

1980
02:14:09,458 --> 02:14:10,542
Where is he?

1981
02:14:10,668 --> 02:14:11,793
He went to the bank.

1982
02:14:11,877 --> 02:14:13,628
They made a mistake
in his favor.

1983
02:14:13,838 --> 02:14:16,506
The banks are closed at night.
Where is he?

1984
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:18,174
You know how skinny Doc is.

1985
02:14:18,259 --> 02:14:20,260
He slipped in through
the night-deposit slot.

1986
02:14:20,344 --> 02:14:22,762
And got stuck halfway in.

1987
02:14:22,847 --> 02:14:26,349
Which indicates there's no tellin'
when he'll be back.

1988
02:14:28,435 --> 02:14:30,895
Buenas noches, señorita.

1989
02:14:40,364 --> 02:14:42,115
Where you goin'?

1990
02:14:42,324 --> 02:14:43,825
Downstairs.

1991
02:14:43,909 --> 02:14:45,618
Didn't I tell you he ain't here?

1992
02:14:46,662 --> 02:14:48,788
I'd like to see for myself.

1993
02:14:51,292 --> 02:14:57,172
Please.

1994
02:14:59,842 --> 02:15:01,176
Por favor.

1995
02:15:01,844 --> 02:15:03,428
Will you let me pass?

1996
02:15:03,554 --> 02:15:05,180
She's too dark to pass.

1997
02:15:05,264 --> 02:15:06,890
- Don't.
- Please don't.

1998
02:15:07,016 --> 02:15:08,600
Por favor.
No comprende.

1999
02:15:08,684 --> 02:15:09,976
Gracias.
De nada.

2000
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:11,102
Mambo!

2001
02:15:11,187 --> 02:15:13,062
Listen, you!
We're listenin'.

2002
02:15:13,147 --> 02:15:16,274
Look, I gotta
give a friend of yours
a message.

2003
02:15:16,358 --> 02:15:17,901
He ain't here.
I gotta tell Tony...

2004
02:15:17,985 --> 02:15:19,736
- I know he is.
- Who says he is?

2005
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:21,404
- Who's the message from?
- Never mind.

2006
02:15:21,488 --> 02:15:23,323
Couldn't be from Chino,
could it?

2007
02:15:23,407 --> 02:15:26,618
Don't you understand?
I want to help!

2008
02:15:26,702 --> 02:15:28,995
Bernardo's girl wants to help?

2009
02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:30,455
Even a greaseball's got feelings.

2010
02:15:30,539 --> 02:15:31,623
But she wants to help get Tony.

2011
02:15:31,707 --> 02:15:32,707
No!

2012
02:15:32,791 --> 02:15:35,210
Not much.
Bernardo's tramp.

2013
02:15:35,294 --> 02:15:36,461
Bernardo's pig!

2014
02:15:36,545 --> 02:15:38,338
- You lyin' Spic!
- Don't do that.

2015
02:15:38,422 --> 02:15:40,215
Gold tooth!
Pierced ear!

2016
02:15:40,633 --> 02:15:42,175
Don't.
Garlic mouth.

2017
02:15:44,345 --> 02:15:45,470
I want to help!

2018
02:15:45,596 --> 02:15:46,763
Come on!

2019
02:15:47,056 --> 02:15:48,139
Go!

2020
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,390
Chiquita!

2021
02:15:50,392 --> 02:15:51,434
ANITA: No!

2022
02:15:53,729 --> 02:15:55,313
Olé! Olé!

2023
02:15:55,731 --> 02:15:56,898
Hey, babe!

2024
02:15:57,566 --> 02:15:58,733
Come on!

2025
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:04,155
Let's get her!

2026
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:05,573
No, you don't.

2027
02:16:05,699 --> 02:16:07,033
Come on, baby.

2028
02:16:16,377 --> 02:16:17,460
Come on!

2029
02:16:17,795 --> 02:16:19,045
DOC: Stop it!

2030
02:16:23,968 --> 02:16:25,969
What are you doing there?

2031
02:16:45,531 --> 02:16:47,365
Bernardo was right.

2032
02:16:49,493 --> 02:16:50,952
If one of you...

2033
02:16:51,078 --> 02:16:54,539
...was lying in
the street bleeding...

2034
02:16:54,957 --> 02:16:57,542
...I'd walk by
and spit on you!

2035
02:16:57,626 --> 02:16:59,836
She'll tell Chino that
Tony's in the cellar.

2036
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:01,796
Don't you touch me!

2037
02:17:04,967 --> 02:17:07,927
I got a message
for your American buddy.

2038
02:17:08,971 --> 02:17:12,682
You tell that murderer that
Maria's never going to meet him!

2039
02:17:13,642 --> 02:17:17,228
You tell him that Chino found
out about them...

2040
02:17:17,563 --> 02:17:19,147
...and shot her!

2041
02:17:20,357 --> 02:17:21,733
She's dead!

2042
02:17:26,322 --> 02:17:28,406
When do you kids stop?

2043
02:17:29,533 --> 02:17:32,368
You make this world lousy!

2044
02:17:33,162 --> 02:17:35,038
We didn't make it, Doc.

2045
02:17:37,041 --> 02:17:38,666
Get outta here!

2046
02:18:09,198 --> 02:18:10,365
Maria?

2047
02:18:11,325 --> 02:18:13,743
Doc, I thought I heard...
You got it!

2048
02:18:13,827 --> 02:18:15,536
Yes, I got it.

2049
02:18:15,704 --> 02:18:17,413
Doc, you're a pal.

2050
02:18:17,498 --> 02:18:19,582
You're the best friend
a guy ever had.

2051
02:18:19,666 --> 02:18:22,210
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
I promise.

2052
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:23,419
Forget that.

2053
02:18:23,504 --> 02:18:24,837
No, I'll never!
I couldn't.

2054
02:18:25,381 --> 02:18:28,674
Doc, you know what we're gonna
do in the country, Maria and me?

2055
02:18:28,759 --> 02:18:31,386
We'll have kids, and we'll
name 'em all after you...

2056
02:18:31,470 --> 02:18:33,471
...even the girls,
so when you visit us...

2057
02:18:33,555 --> 02:18:34,889
Wake up!

2058
02:18:35,891 --> 02:18:38,893
Is this the only way
to get through to you...

2059
02:18:39,436 --> 02:18:43,815
...do just what you all do,
bust like a hot water pipe?

2060
02:18:44,024 --> 02:18:45,316
What's got into you?

2061
02:18:45,401 --> 02:18:48,778
Why do you kids live
like there's a war on?

2062
02:18:53,325 --> 02:18:55,034
Why do you kill?

2063
02:18:59,248 --> 02:19:01,374
I told you how it happened.

2064
02:19:02,251 --> 02:19:03,918
Maria understands.

2065
02:19:04,795 --> 02:19:06,754
I thought you did, too.

2066
02:19:06,922 --> 02:19:08,923
Maria understands nothing...

2067
02:19:09,842 --> 02:19:11,259
Never again.

2068
02:19:11,635 --> 02:19:13,886
There is no Maria, Tony.

2069
02:19:17,933 --> 02:19:19,016
What?

2070
02:19:20,727 --> 02:19:21,727
I can't.

2071
02:19:21,812 --> 02:19:22,812
No, no, Doc.

2072
02:19:23,564 --> 02:19:25,857
Now, tell me.
What is it?

2073
02:19:26,942 --> 02:19:28,901
That was Anita upstairs.

2074
02:19:30,070 --> 02:19:33,114
Chino found out
about you and Maria...

2075
02:19:34,324 --> 02:19:36,325
...and he killed her.

2076
02:19:43,959 --> 02:19:44,959
No.

2077
02:19:50,466 --> 02:19:51,632
Maria.

2078
02:19:59,683 --> 02:20:01,225
Not Maria, Doc.

2079
02:20:02,686 --> 02:20:03,936
She's...

2080
02:20:10,903 --> 02:20:13,988
Chino!

2081
02:20:16,033 --> 02:20:18,159
Come and get me, too, Chino!

2082
02:20:21,038 --> 02:20:32,215
Chino!

2083
02:20:32,549 --> 02:20:33,633
Come and get me, too!

2084
02:20:33,717 --> 02:20:34,759
Tony!

2085
02:20:34,843 --> 02:20:35,843
Who's that?

2086
02:20:35,928 --> 02:20:37,345
It's me, Anybodys.
Come on.

2087
02:20:37,513 --> 02:20:38,930
Get out of here!

2088
02:20:39,014 --> 02:20:41,682
Chino, come and get me,
damn you!

2089
02:20:41,767 --> 02:20:42,892
What are you doin'?

2090
02:20:42,976 --> 02:20:44,769
Get out of here! Chino!

2091
02:20:44,853 --> 02:20:46,646
Why don't you come with me?
We'll find...

2092
02:20:46,730 --> 02:20:49,315
It ain't playin' anymore!
Can't any of you get that?

2093
02:20:49,399 --> 02:20:50,608
But the gang...

2094
02:20:50,692 --> 02:20:53,110
You're a girl!
Be a girl and beat it!

2095
02:20:57,199 --> 02:20:58,366
Chino!

2096
02:21:00,244 --> 02:21:03,079
Come on, Chino!
Get me, too!

2097
02:21:04,039 --> 02:21:18,219
Chino!

2098
02:21:18,303 --> 02:21:20,012
I'm callin' for you, Chino!

2099
02:21:21,265 --> 02:21:24,642
There's nobody here but me.
Come on!

2100
02:21:25,769 --> 02:21:27,395
Please, will you?

2101
02:21:29,022 --> 02:21:30,898
I'm waitin' for you.

2102
02:21:31,608 --> 02:21:33,109
I want you to.

2103
02:21:44,329 --> 02:21:45,496
Maria.

2104
02:21:46,748 --> 02:21:47,832
Tony!

2105
02:21:51,336 --> 02:21:52,503
Maria.

2106
02:21:57,718 --> 02:22:02,346
Maria!

2107
02:22:29,249 --> 02:22:30,207
I...

2108
02:22:30,292 --> 02:22:32,251
I didn't believe hard enough.

2109
02:22:32,336 --> 02:22:33,961
Loving is enough.

2110
02:22:34,796 --> 02:22:36,088
Not here.

2111
02:22:37,341 --> 02:22:39,133
They won't let us be.

2112
02:22:39,885 --> 02:22:41,677
Then we'll get away.

2113
02:22:45,349 --> 02:22:46,474
Yeah.

2114
02:22:46,892 --> 02:22:48,142
- We can.
- Yes.

2115
02:22:48,226 --> 02:22:49,602
- We will.
- Yes.

2116

MARIA: Stay back!

2124
02:24:15,689 --> 02:24:18,023
How do you fire
this gun, Chino?

2125
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:21,444
Just by pulling
this little trigger?

2126
02:24:22,028 --> 02:24:24,405
How many bullets
are left, Chino?

2127
02:24:25,198 --> 02:24:26,741
Enough for you?

2128
02:24:26,908 --> 02:24:28,159
And you?

2129
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:31,245
All of you!

2130
02:24:31,496 --> 02:24:35,207
You all killed him,
and my brother, and Riff...

2131
02:24:35,834 --> 02:24:37,877
...not with bullets
and guns.

2132
02:24:38,628 --> 02:24:39,962
With hate!

2133
02:24:40,756 --> 02:24:44,508
I can kill, too,
because now I have hate!

2134
02:24:45,093 --> 02:24:48,012
How many can I kill, Chino?
How many?

2135
02:24:48,597 --> 02:24:51,265
And still have one bullet
left for me?

2136
02:24:58,064 --> 02:24:59,106
No!

2137
02:25:13,121 --> 02:25:15,247
Don't you touch him!

2138
02:26:10,011 --> 02:26:12,096
Te adoro, Anton.

2139
02:33:40,878 --> 02:33:41,878
English

2139
02:33:42,305 --> 02:34:42,252
