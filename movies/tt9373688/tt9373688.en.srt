3
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:29,418
And what about that one?

4
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:36,990
That's Ursa Major.

5
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:38,488
Very good.

6
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,997
How about the big W there?

7
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:44,103
- Cassiopeia.
- Yeah.

8
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,903
And how about
that big, bright one?

9
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:51,638
- That's a planet.
- Very good.

10
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,210
Jupiter?

11
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:56,775
No, Jupiter we can't see
right now.

12
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,678
What's that smaller body
just off it?

13
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,752
- You see that?
- A moon.

14
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,079
Yeah.

15
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:08,160
- Is it Earth?
- Very good.

16
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:15,656
Dad!

17
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:34,411
Shh, shh.

18
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:37,612
Shh.

19
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:51,560
Remmy?

20
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:53,628
Remmy!

21
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,432
Remmy!

22
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:59,304
That's far enough.

23
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,160
He's coming, Remmy.

24
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,870
To here,
that one up here,

25
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,710
plus eight would be sixteen.

26
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:46,318
You would add one more.
That'd be 17.

27
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,043
So I put the one up here
and the one up here,

28
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,650
so that will be
eight plus nine.

29
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,322
- I don't know.
- Then let's go...

30
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:55,360
Dad!

31
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:58,627
Dad!

32
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:20,214
Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me.

33
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:25,749
We don't know
where we're from.

34
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:27,188
I'll get her to bed.

35
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:28,684
I'll be right back.

36
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,069
Hey.

37
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:47,808
What's up?

38
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,241
There are strangers nearby.

39
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:54,584
No.

40
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:58,313
No. It's just us.

41
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:02,126
I'm scared.

42
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,890
There's nothing to be scared of.

43
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,728
You're fine on your own.

44
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:11,966
Are you gonna stay?

45
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,537
Are you?

46
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:16,571
If you leave the bed,

47
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,740
I'm gonna shave off
your eyebrows.

48
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,745
I will scream
the loudest possible scream

49
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:26,582
and follow you around
until they grow back.

50
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,077
I'll tie you up
with your own socks

51
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:29,784
and leave you
by the graves all night.

52
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,454
I will escape, steal the
lighter from where Mom hides it

53
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:35,956
and set the house on fire.

54
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:37,926
You mom and I are gonna
hold you by your ankles

55
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:41,323
and then slowly lower you
into the hole in the outhouse.

56
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:43,633
I will poop on your face
while you're sleeping.

57
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:46,229
Jesus.

58
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,373
See?

59
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,267
No one's gonna mess
with you, kid.

60
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,041
Good night.

61
00:07:00,948 --> 00:07:03,287
You want me
to leave this one on?

62
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,650
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

63
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:35,351

Okay.

70
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:01,541
Um, I'll try.

71
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,207

Did you ever see a whale?

76
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,149
No.

77
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:47,957
How about you?

78
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:49,055
No.

79
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,596
I wish.

80
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:54,731
An owl?

81
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:58,562
How about an elephant?

82
00:08:58,631 --> 00:08:59,934
Nope.

83
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,708
Did you see anything?

84
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:06,270
Dogs.

85
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:11,809
Earth isn't what it once was,
you know.

86
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:13,409
Is that why you left?

87
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:19,558
We left because we wanted
something more.

88
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:24,222
We're very lucky
to have this place.

89
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:27,093
Why?

90
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:30,635
'Cause someday
it's gonna be just like Earth.

91
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:34,936
- We can talk about it more tomorrow.
- Okay.

92
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:37,774
You gonna stay?

93
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,705
Y... es.

94
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:43,511
Yes.

95
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,147
I love you very much.

96
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:46,310
Love you.

97
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:51,285
Good night.

98
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:52,382
'Night.

99
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,318
Reza!

100
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,619
Don't move, okay?
You stay right here.

101
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,130
- I told you!
- Shut up!

102
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,070
What's going on?

103
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,464
Fuck.

104
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,569
What's going on?

105
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,806
Do you see anything?

106
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:28,687
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

107
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:46,796
What if it's his son?

108
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:48,003
Don't.

109
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:04,921
I count six.

110
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,250
No.

111
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,184
They're changing their voices.

112
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,293
There are only three.

113
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:21,531
Come on.

114
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:26,239
Come on! Come on!

115
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,645
Come on!

116
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,608
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

117
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,478
I think the other pig
is still alive.

118
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:11,823
Hello?

119
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:15,794
Let it go, Rem.

120
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:38,107
You okay?

121
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,573
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

122
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,840
First rule?

123
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,218
Stay calm.

124
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,748
Stay alive.

125
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,639
Hey.

126
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:23,614
You are in very, very
good hands, okay.

127
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,486
Remmy!

128
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:30,286
Get in here!

129
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:32,128
Get in here right now!

130
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:01,724
Get inside!

131
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,932
- Do you have Remmy?
- Yes!

132
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,316
I need your eyes on the ridge!

133
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:32,551
You see anything?

134
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:38,997
I see him!

135
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:42,523
- Is he still at the sun?
- Yes!

136
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,053
You lock the door behind me.

137
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:07,084
- It's gonna be dark soon.
- I know.

138
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,485
Dad, Dad!

139
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:11,724
You stay with your mother.

140
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:12,822
Dad!

141
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:38,621
Get inside,
get inside now!

142
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,769
Hey.

143
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:10,044
Okay?

144
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,350
Turn it off.

145
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,769
Mom.

146
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:08,377
I have to go to the bathroom.

147
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:33,695
We'll use this.

148
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:34,793
Come on.

149
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:40,634
It's okay.

150
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:11,869
What's going on?

151
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,469
The main lights went off.

152
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,750
Stay here.

153
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:07,818
Mom.

154
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,430
Drop the blade.

155
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:25,260
Drop it.

156
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:40,946
This place doesn't
belong to you.

157
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,114
It was my parents'.

158
00:23:47,855 --> 00:23:50,455
And I don't know
what you did to them.

159
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:52,089
I don't really care,

160
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:59,503
but I was born here,
I was raised here,

161
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:03,639
and I've come a long,
long way to get back.

162
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:06,642
And I'm here to stay.

163
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:13,814
I don't wanna hurt you.

164
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,345
So you can leave if you want.

165
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:22,018
But I'm pretty
sure that you know

166
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,759
what's waiting
for you out there.

167
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:35,605
I know how to get this
place back on its feet.

168
00:24:37,604 --> 00:24:39,367
And I can protect you.

169
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:42,370
If you behave.

170
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,124
Stay in sight.

171
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,962
We can go, Mommy, we can go.

172
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:09,804
Mom, we can go, please?

173
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:12,302
- I know, I know, listen.
- Please let us go, Mommy.

174
00:25:12,371 --> 00:25:13,741
Listen, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

175
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,815
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

176
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,208
Okay?

177
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:21,750
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

178
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,006
Hey.

179
00:26:01,888 --> 00:26:04,562
I will be right back, okay?

180
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:07,864
I want you to stay right here.

181
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:08,962
Promise?

182
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,932
Yeah, okay.

183
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,271
If you move another muscle,

184
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,277
your kid is gonna
be alone with me.

185
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:40,020
Think!

186
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:43,892
How is killing me
going to help you?

187
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:58,808
Okay.

188
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,970
Here's the deal.

189
00:28:01,873 --> 00:28:06,981
For 30 days you don't pull
another stunt like this on me,

190
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,079
I will take this gun,

191
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,053
put it on that table over there,

192
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:16,320
turn my back around and
walk out on to that porch.

193
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:18,421
30 days.

194
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:28,530
And you'll get your chance,
if you still want it.

195
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:40,014
I want my husband buried.

196
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:24,256
Stay as long as you need.

197
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,770
We can leave.

198
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:36,163
Mom, we can leave now.

199
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,940
No, Rem, we can't.

200
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:14,519
We need to talk.

201
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:25,464
We've got our work
cut out for us.

202
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:27,034
Luckily we have
everything that we need

203
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:30,197
to get this place
back on its feet.

204
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:31,305
Fuck off.

205
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:36,970
Okay.

206
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,548
Taps should be running,
by the way.

207
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:43,476
Remmy!

208
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:54,216
Hey.

209
00:34:54,285 --> 00:34:55,389
Hey, hey, hey.

210
00:34:59,588 --> 00:35:00,520
Hey, it's harmless.

211
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:02,099
Don't touch me.

212
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:16,502
What's his name?

213
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:18,313
It's just a tool.

214
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,362
This is very good.

215
00:35:40,563 --> 00:35:42,634
Can I go play with Steve?

216
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,435
Steve?

217
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:48,211
The robot, I named him Steve.

218
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:50,147
Sure.

219
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:23,136
Can I take your plate?

220
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,977
And... catch.

221
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:01,075
Yay.

222
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:03,176
Come here.

223
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:05,519
Yay.

224
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:15,859
Catch.

225
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:29,807
My name's Jerry, by the way.

226
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:33,041
My parents ever mention me?

227
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:39,421
Guess not.

228
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,294
Guess there was no point.

229
00:37:45,561 --> 00:37:47,830
Made it pretty clear
I was never coming back.

230
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,431
Leave me alone.

231
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:54,469
I didn't wanna be here either,
you know.

232
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,669
There was nowhere else left.

233
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:01,509
Cities, other settlements,
all gone.

234
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,328
She's a cute kid.

235
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,130
I didn't kill your mother.

236
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:31,736
That's good of you.

237
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:34,773
She was already
dead when we got here.

238
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:40,812
I never saw any of your cities.

239
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:47,384
Our transport got shot down
when we entered the atmosphere.

240
00:38:47,453 --> 00:38:49,018
Your dad took us in.

241
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,761
Then one day, when I was
seven months pregnant,

242
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:57,266
he stuck a rifle in our faces
and told us to leave.

243
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,763
Why would he do
a thing like that?

244
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:02,471
He figured it out,
that we were from Earth.

245
00:39:04,873 --> 00:39:08,642
So I slit his throat with
the knife you just washed.

246
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:13,647
If you touch her,
I'll carve your heart out.

247
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:17,210
You could empty out a whole gun

248
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:20,550
of yours into me,
I'd still get to you.

249
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:22,755
You assume a lot about me.

250
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,699
I see no reason why
I'd need to touch her.

251
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:56,024
Can Steve
sleep with us?

252
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,252
I don't think it sleeps.

253
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:02,795
Come on.

254
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,028
Good night.

255
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:08,867
Good night.

256
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:33,991
Get into bed,
I'll be right there.

257
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,090
Hi, hey, Cassy.

258
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,260
Wait here, Steve.

259
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,875
Come on, Cassy.

260
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:21,973
Yes.

261
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,339
You in there, kid?

262
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:34,657
Hey, so I know,

263
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,726
I know that I'm not supposed to
be talking to you,

264
00:41:40,093 --> 00:41:45,359
but I lost something
from a notebook I keep.

265
00:41:47,764 --> 00:41:48,802
An old drawing.

266
00:41:51,938 --> 00:41:55,072
You wouldn't know
anything about that?

267
00:41:58,043 --> 00:42:00,583
Do you think maybe
Steve took it?

268
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:10,818
Anyways, um, I just came
to tell him

269
00:42:10,887 --> 00:42:14,531
that he can keep it.

270
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:16,863
I won't snitch.

271
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,866
All right?

272
00:43:09,912 --> 00:43:11,319
Remmy?

273
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,096
Smells good.

274
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,997
Where's the kid?

275
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,608
Just called her.

276
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:04,558
Are you getting up?

277
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:48,140
Have you seen Remmy?

278
00:46:08,929 --> 00:46:11,493
Go away, Steve, it's not safe.

279
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,628
Go!

280
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:20,007
Go.

281
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:29,141
And tell my mom that she
can have another daughter.

282
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,248
With Jerry!

283
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,474
Remmy!

284
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:38,814
Hard to miss, isn't it?

285
00:52:44,355 --> 00:52:46,393
Once you know it's there.

286
00:52:51,102 --> 00:52:54,027
I was eight when
my parents told me.

287
00:53:03,344 --> 00:53:04,745
So you wanna know
what's out there?

288
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:05,841
Obviously.

289
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:09,713
Nothing.

290
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,321
Sand, a rock.

291
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:20,057
There was once more,
but it's all gone now,

292
00:53:20,126 --> 00:53:21,820
or will be soon.

293
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:24,295
Then where did you come from?

294
00:53:24,364 --> 00:53:27,896
From the war, for less and less.

295
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,570
I don't believe you.

296
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:43,685
Ever notice that the
sunrises are getting bluer?

297
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:45,253
What is that?

298
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:49,288
It's from the dust
in the atmosphere.

299
00:53:49,723 --> 00:53:54,395
An atmosphere that we
created and maintained.

300
00:53:56,091 --> 00:53:59,191
It's all just blowing
off into space.

301
00:54:00,598 --> 00:54:03,470
I know it's a hard thing
to hear,

302
00:54:03,538 --> 00:54:05,841
you know, but the sooner
that you accept it,

303
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,704
the sooner you'll realize

304
00:54:08,773 --> 00:54:11,808
how lucky we are
to have this place.

305
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:16,582
We...

306
00:54:18,946 --> 00:54:21,657
we have everything
we need,

307
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:23,820
right here.

308
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:43,136
Rem, stop playing
with your food.

309
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,646
Come on, you gotta eat.

310
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,654
You don't like sweet potatoes?

311
00:54:59,822 --> 00:55:02,254
I used to not like them either.

312
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,687
I'm going back to my bed, Rem.

313
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:46,061
I think I know what
you're feeling right now.

314
00:56:50,701 --> 00:56:52,903
I would feel the same way.

315
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:03,309
I just need you to know
that I loved your father

316
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:09,084
and I love you more
than you will ever know.

317
00:57:53,961 --> 00:57:55,399
Forgot about this.

318
00:57:55,468 --> 00:57:57,473
Wanna learn how to play?

319
00:57:58,666 --> 00:57:59,706
You?

320
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:02,302
- Little bit.
- Really?

321
00:58:03,904 --> 00:58:05,371
How about a song?

322
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,616
Been a long time since
I heard any music.

323
00:58:10,646 --> 00:58:11,685
Sure.

324
00:58:20,689 --> 00:58:21,728
Come.

325
00:58:37,376 --> 00:58:38,404
Sorry.

Remmy.

Remmy.

334
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,218
Remmy, please.

335
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:58,924
Remmy.

336
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:01,091
Remmy.

337
01:00:02,464 --> 01:00:04,391
I need you to trust me.

338
01:00:05,926 --> 01:00:06,965
Remmy.

339
01:00:09,271 --> 01:00:10,936
I hate you.

340
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:14,940
Remmy.

341
01:00:17,104 --> 01:00:20,506
I hate you.

342
01:00:42,737 --> 01:00:45,237
Everything okay?

343
01:00:45,306 --> 01:00:46,334
Mm-hmm.

344
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,458
You okay?

345
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:15,132
Yeah.

346
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:19,334
She's, uh...

347
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,304
She's just adjusting.

348
01:01:24,278 --> 01:01:25,307
Hmm.

349
01:01:52,738 --> 01:01:54,342
You don't have to.

350
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:07,250
Nah, I'm just tired
of it weighing me down.

351
01:02:09,356 --> 01:02:10,385
So.

352
01:02:46,419 --> 01:02:48,822
Think about your daughter.

353
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:49,930
I am.

354
01:02:59,574 --> 01:03:00,868
What are you doing?

355
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,075
Stop.

356
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:29,056
Please, please, please.

357
01:04:29,124 --> 01:04:30,325
No, no, no, no!

358
01:04:30,394 --> 01:04:32,159
Listen, everything's
gonna be okay.

359
01:04:32,227 --> 01:04:34,331
I'm never gonna hurt you.

360
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,566
I just need you to stay.

361
01:04:38,635 --> 01:04:41,099
I just need you to stay
until I say you can.

362
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:42,207
Okay?

363
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:45,573
Can you do that?

364
01:04:47,813 --> 01:04:49,181
Can you do that?

365
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:24,216
You can come inside now.

366
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,491
Remmy.

367
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:42,564
It's okay.

368
01:05:47,267 --> 01:05:48,306
It's okay.

369
01:06:10,292 --> 01:06:11,527
When you're ready.

370
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:12,251
Seven piggies in a row,

371
01:07:12,686 --> 01:07:15,620
if he hollers, then you'll know

372
01:07:15,689 --> 01:07:18,891
he's the pig who wants to go.

373
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:29,676
My mother said
to pick the second best one

374
01:07:29,744 --> 01:07:33,873
and it's Y-O-U.

375
01:08:08,409 --> 01:08:09,942
I was thinking.

376
01:08:16,024 --> 01:08:18,720
You might want to give it a go.

377
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,388
I'm going to the valley
tomorrow morning.

378
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:25,391
Isn't that exciting?

379
01:09:28,963 --> 01:09:30,495
I'll need Steve...

380
01:09:32,296 --> 01:09:35,665
if that's okay with you.

381
01:09:40,003 --> 01:09:44,003
He's agreed, provided
that we are back by lunch.

382
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:49,074
I pointed out that
he doesn't eat lunch.

383
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:53,478
And he looks back at me with
that steely gaze of his,

384
01:09:53,547 --> 01:09:56,983
and he says,

385
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:01,229
"Jerry,
we've talked about this."

386
01:10:06,527 --> 01:10:07,565
I saw that.

387
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:11,734
Eleventh time this year.

388
01:10:16,537 --> 01:10:17,575
Wild times.

389
01:11:38,819 --> 01:11:39,921
Who goes there?

390
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:42,858
Remmy?

391
01:11:44,394 --> 01:11:45,432
Is that you?

392
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:53,268
I knew it.

393
01:11:53,337 --> 01:11:54,474
You missed me?

394
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:10,556
You should hop in.

395
01:12:13,854 --> 01:12:17,365
It's murky but it's clean.

396
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,634
And it feels so good.

397
01:12:24,701 --> 01:12:27,598
I'll leave a blanket for you.

398
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:28,706
Enjoy.

399
01:14:16,777 --> 01:14:17,914
Want a drink?

400
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:21,951
Go on.

401
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:31,763
Careful now with that one,
the batch is strong.

402
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,771
What do you think?

403
01:14:44,837 --> 01:14:45,876
Cheers.

404
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,301
Hey, I, I have
something for you.

405
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:20,772
I think you're gonna like it.

406
01:15:20,841 --> 01:15:21,879
Sit over here.

407
01:15:39,862 --> 01:15:44,836
Go on, just, just take it.

408
01:16:04,056 --> 01:16:08,057
It helps that you grew up
to look so much like her.

409
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,965
She'd be so proud of you, Remmy.

410
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:29,045
It's okay.

411
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:31,886
It's okay, come on.

412
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:33,612
Okay.

413
01:16:45,132 --> 01:16:46,066
Come on.

414
01:16:57,442 --> 01:16:58,470
It's okay.

415
01:20:05,962 --> 01:20:07,527
So how was your day?

416
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:17,845
You know there's no rush.

417
01:20:20,181 --> 01:20:24,049
The important thing is
that you feel comfortable.

418
01:20:27,146 --> 01:20:28,188
You know?

419
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:32,486
All those things that you're
feeling are completely normal.

420
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:37,227
I can't do it.

421
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,529
Hey.

422
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:48,205
I can't do it.

423
01:20:50,644 --> 01:20:52,176
You can't do what?

424
01:21:00,718 --> 01:21:01,812
It's okay.

425
01:21:03,518 --> 01:21:06,116
Like I said,
we've got plenty of time.

426
01:21:06,185 --> 01:21:07,224
Ever.

427
01:21:08,354 --> 01:21:09,486
You're still young.

428
01:21:09,555 --> 01:21:11,931
You're not listening to me.

429
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,166
I haven't had
much practice lately.

430
01:21:20,401 --> 01:21:22,566
We've been through this before.

431
01:21:22,634 --> 01:21:25,171
This is bigger than you and me.

432
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:27,772
I'm not about to give up.

433
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,279
That's very noble of you.

434
01:21:31,348 --> 01:21:34,350
A man's gotta stand
for something.

435
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:38,585
If you try to force one
inside of me, I will kill it.

436
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,932
Do you know how to do that?

437
01:21:48,063 --> 01:21:49,101
'Cause I do.

438
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:53,039
Pretty dangerous if you don't.

439
01:21:54,834 --> 01:21:59,111
And then where would
you be without me?

440
01:22:00,845 --> 01:22:02,147
I don't know.

441
01:22:03,917 --> 01:22:06,315
About where I am now, I guess.

442
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:08,545
Gotten pretty good
talking to myself.

443
01:22:08,614 --> 01:22:11,217
So what are you waiting for?

444
01:22:11,285 --> 01:22:13,290
Is that what you want?

445
01:22:14,461 --> 01:22:15,490
Hmm?

446
01:22:16,422 --> 01:22:18,229
Is that what you want?

447
01:22:19,562 --> 01:22:22,994
If I just held you down
and did it?

448
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:27,671
So you can just keep on
pretending like I'm the bad guy?

449
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:29,141
Go on hating me?

450
01:22:31,811 --> 01:22:34,014
I don't hate you, Jerry.

451
01:22:41,281 --> 01:22:42,649
Then what is it?

452
01:23:00,303 --> 01:23:02,702
You think it over some more.

453
01:23:07,339 --> 01:23:08,378
I have.

454
01:23:38,537 --> 01:23:40,311
Leave me alone, Steve.

455
01:24:16,212 --> 01:24:18,008
You going somewhere?

456
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:52,846
Give it back!

457
01:24:52,914 --> 01:24:55,650
If you leave, you're gonna
die in a day, maybe two.

458
01:24:55,719 --> 01:24:57,355
Stop pretending like
you're doing this for me.

459
01:24:57,424 --> 01:25:01,459
Okay, all of this,
all of this I did for you!

460
01:25:01,528 --> 01:25:04,795
If you think there's someone
out there, you're wrong.

461
01:25:04,864 --> 01:25:06,322
I'm it, okay?

462
01:25:06,391 --> 01:25:07,431
Me!

463
01:25:09,529 --> 01:25:11,237
Give me back my mask.

464
01:25:13,133 --> 01:25:15,507
- You can't control me!
- You're my responsibility.

465
01:25:15,576 --> 01:25:18,077
- Yeah, and why's that?
- Well, because someone couldn't

466
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:20,410
accept the reality
of her situation!

467
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:21,740
Well, this time you
don't have a child

468
01:25:21,809 --> 01:25:23,049
to use to pressure
me into your bed.

469
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:25,512
Okay, you want
your fucking mask?

470
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,479
Huh?
You want your mask?

471
01:25:27,547 --> 01:25:28,978
Here's your fucking mask!

472
01:25:29,047 --> 01:25:31,758
Okay, this is how
it will feel, okay.

473
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:32,821
This is how it'll end!

474
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:33,919
Hmm!

475
01:26:36,687 --> 01:26:39,424
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

476
01:26:39,492 --> 01:26:42,559
It's okay, it's just,
it's okay, it's...

477
01:26:42,627 --> 01:26:45,089
It's just so that we can talk.
It's okay.

478
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,230
- No!
- It's just so that we can talk.

479
01:26:47,299 --> 01:26:49,162
- Jerry.
- Hey, it's okay.

480
01:26:49,231 --> 01:26:50,270
Please.

481
01:26:51,468 --> 01:26:52,970
- I'm sorry.
- Jerry.

482
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:55,440
Okay, I'm sorry. It's...

483
01:26:55,508 --> 01:26:56,843
But, but you leave
and then you're dead.

484
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,239
And then that will be it.

485
01:26:58,308 --> 01:26:59,777
- Okay.
- Okay.

486
01:26:59,846 --> 01:27:01,347
Okay.

487
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,415
And, and I just, I just,
I just can't risk that,

488
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:05,684
not, not while there's
still some sort of hope.

489
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:06,781
Okay?

490
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:08,654
Jerry.

491
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,450
- Jerry, please.
- Hey, hey, hey, wait.

492
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:13,623
Listen to me.

493
01:27:15,028 --> 01:27:17,461
Can you listen to me?

494
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:20,531
We both have
a responsibility, okay?

495
01:27:21,733 --> 01:27:25,363
You and me.
Which neither of us asked for.

496
01:27:25,432 --> 01:27:26,471
Okay?

497
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:31,868
You all keep making me
do these terrible things.

498
01:27:31,937 --> 01:27:33,711
- Yes, we need to...
- No.

499
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:37,117
- I need you to understand how important this is.
- No.

500
01:27:37,186 --> 01:27:40,109
Please, I need you
to understand

501
01:27:40,178 --> 01:27:42,014
- that this is so important.
- Okay.

502
01:27:42,082 --> 01:27:45,784
- Okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- Let me go.

503
01:27:45,853 --> 01:27:47,620
- Let me go.
- No, it's okay.

504
01:27:47,689 --> 01:27:50,021
Let me go!
Let me go!

505
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,231
- Okay, it's okay.
- Let me go!

506
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,835
It's okay, it's okay,
you're okay.

507
01:27:54,903 --> 01:27:56,501
It's just... shh, shh.

508
01:27:57,632 --> 01:27:59,164
It doesn't have to be bad.

509
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:00,735
It doesn't have to be like...
please, not like this.

510
01:28:00,804 --> 01:28:02,571
- It's okay.
- Please, not like this.

511
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,704
- It's okay.
- Let me go, Jerry.

512
01:28:04,773 --> 01:28:07,706
Let me go, Jerry,
Jerry, let me go!

513
01:28:07,775 --> 01:28:09,310
- Stop it.
- Let me leave!

514
01:28:09,378 --> 01:28:11,348
Stop it!
Stop it!

515
01:28:11,417 --> 01:28:12,809
Just stop it!

516
01:28:12,878 --> 01:28:16,513
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

517
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:17,621
Okay.

518
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:19,458
Stop it.

519
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:22,692
Stop it.

520
01:28:23,624 --> 01:28:25,959
Hmm, okay stop it.

521
01:28:26,767 --> 01:28:27,796
Stop it.

522
01:28:29,631 --> 01:28:32,365
It doesn't have to be bad.

523
01:28:32,434 --> 01:28:34,308
Just, just...

524
01:28:35,771 --> 01:28:39,544
Okay, just.

525
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:44,978
Okay, just close your eyes.

526
01:29:18,214 --> 01:29:19,419
God!

527
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:06,532
You need me as much
as I need you.

528
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:13,638
I disagree.

529
01:33:55,591 --> 01:33:57,455
Hello!

530
01:35:55,745 --> 01:35:57,047
I'm going, Steve.

531
01:36:00,553 --> 01:36:02,316
You have to stay here.

532
01:36:04,955 --> 01:36:07,057
Don't look at me like that.

533
01:36:08,563 --> 01:36:11,061
This is your place now, okay?

534
01:36:16,227 --> 01:36:17,496
Do you hate me?

535
01:36:22,904 --> 01:36:24,173
Yeah, me neither.

536
01:36:28,547 --> 01:36:30,146
The opposite.
