So a recent study
in the<i> American Journal of Public Health</i>

171
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,916
found that last year,
30% of sexual assault survivors

had to pay $940 for their own rape kits.

That's a girl's whole paycheck.

"The Real Cost of Sexual Assault"

00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,208
If you just would've waited
five more seconds,

468
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,583
you wouldn't have had to insult my dress.

469
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:49,666
I did not insult her dress.
Did you hear me insult her dress?

470
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,458
You just want her popping.

471
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,791
Nell gets it.

472
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,041
I was watching
<i>Say Yes to the Dress </i>the other day,

473
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,250
and the girl on there

474
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:04,583
had, um, this tulle princess skirt
you could tie on or tie off.

475
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:09,166
Kate Middleton didn't wear a tulle
princess skirt to her wedding.

476
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,708
Neither should the expecting
child brides of Ohio.

477
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,000
[Ani's mom laughs]

478
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you.

479
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,625
Yes, she was about six months along.

480
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,708
- [Ani groans]
- Mmm.

481
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,791
Still, I think I would do that over this,
um… The bolerino thing.

482
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,375
Bolero.

483
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:26,916
[whispers] Bolero.

484
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,708
Have another.

485
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,375
[Nell] Ani.

486
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,041
[clicks tongue]

487
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,333
Excuse me for trying to celebrate
the most important day of your life.

488
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,125
I'm gonna go check out the sales upstairs.

489
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,583
I'm afraid you can't bring glass
outside the bridal boutique, ma'am.

490
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,000
Okay, don't kill me,
but I sort of agree with her.

491
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,666
I mean, you're sexier than this, right?

492
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,666
I'm getting married
in the whale print capital of the world.

493
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,500
I don't wanna embarrass Luke
in some sequined mermaid dress.

494
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,791
[Nell] Embarrass Luke?
Ugh! Fucking yikes, Ani.

495
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,541
Nell, I'm… I'm five weeks out.

496
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:10,000
Why would you tell me
that my dress is wrong now?

497
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,291
No, it's not wrong. Okay?
Nothing about you is wrong.

498
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:15,625
Jesus. Unclench, okay?

499
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,166
Yeah, well, that's impossible<i>,</i>

500
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,541
what with the real housewife
of Pennsyltucky in town.

501
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,916
[Nell laughs]

502
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,250
Be nice to your mother.

503
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,375
[Ani's mom] That cut looks nice on you.

504
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,791
More forgiving across the middle
than some of your other stuff.

505
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,833
[phone ringing]

506
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:33,750
[Nell] Whoa!

507
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,583
It's the director. It's Aaron.

508
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,750
- [phone rings]
- Let it go to voicemail.

509
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,791
I thought you told him no.
Why is he calling you?

510
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,375
[Ani sighs] I did,

511
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:49,708
but I just wanted to know
if I change my mind,

512
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,875
when I would need to be available.

513
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,125
[exhales sharply] Holy shit.

514
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:59,000
- Ani.
- Like, good "shit"?

515
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:05,166
Babe, you wanna expose Dean Barton
for the sanctimonious prick that he is.

516
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,416
This is no-dairy-for-a-month shit.

517
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,708
Single-wipe shit.

518
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:16,625
No. Uh, I don't know. I, um…
I'm not ready.

519
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,041
- Come on, what will it take?
- Oh.

520
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,750
Let's see. Uh, Dean's making
viral speeches at Congress,

521
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:26,208
and I have a story due Monday about how to
pleasure an uncircumcised penis.

522
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:28,708
They're more sensitive
than the ones without their turtlenecks,

523
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:29,958
according to the experts.

524
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,875
Nobody believed me back then,

525
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,208
because I was
a Wet Seal wearing gutter rat.

526
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:37,541
If I'm gonna do this,
I need to be bulletproof.

527
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:41,041
I need to be able to say
that I work at<i> The New York Times,</i>

528
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,333
that I live in an elevator
doorman building in Tribeca,

529
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:45,875
and that my name is Ani Harrison

530
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,291
because I married
the lacrosse captain of Nantucket.

531
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,166
And how dare anyone believe
I did what Dean said I did

532
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,250
while wiping away a single tear
with this hand in particular.

533
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,958
[breathing deeply]

534
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,291
Four out of five.

535
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,916
Not that you need any of it
to make you credible.

536
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,833
[scoffs]

537

You don't,

538
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,541
but I do.

539
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:11,750
I do.

It's like, you work retail.

543
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,583

- Okay.

544
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:29,750
- You're fine.
- Oh, thank you.

545

Oh, excuse me.
You look exactly like my daughter.

Uh, people are always mistaking me

Nice eye.

557

Hi, Aaron?

558
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,833
I always stay at the Ritz Carlton

Look at this little munchkin.

626
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,416
- Baby, look at it.
- Cute. Can I have a beer, please?

[indistinct bar chatter]

Is this your husband?

629
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:54,125
As far as I know.

630
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,750
Sorry. My God, 5th was a parking lot.

- [Luke] There he is.
- Luke.

- Good to see ya.
- [Luke] Great to see ya.

- Honey.
- Hey.

This is Ani.

Nice to meet you. Andrew.

Mr. Larson, it's me.

TifAni.

TifAni?

Was he your teacher?

[Mr. Larson] TifAni.

642
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:24,375
Uh… I didn't recognize you. You look…

643
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:27,416
[Ani] <i>Like none of it ever happened.</i>

644

We can seat you now.

645
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,958
So… I'm sorry, wait a second.
Did you change your name or...

646
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:37,416
No, this is, um, TifAni,
from when I left Brentley.

647
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,875
Oh.

648
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:39,958
Oh God.

649
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,666
- God, I'm so sorry for…
- Oh God.

- You know, everything.
- It's okay.

I'm so sorry. I…

00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:53,458
Well, if it's any consolation,

655
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:58,000

got into credit derivatives.

[chuckles]

657
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,416
You know, TifAni
was the strongest writer in my class.

658
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,666
Well, now she's senior editor
at<i> The Women's Bible.</i>

659
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,083
<i>- The Women's Bible?</i>
- Yeah.

- That's fantastic.
- Thank you.

[Mr. Larson] Cheers.

668
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:28,250
Mmm. So, Ani, you have to tell us,

669
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:31,083
what do you think of the director
in the skinny jeans?

670
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,791
- You're doing the documentary?
- [Mr. Larson] They got to you too, huh?

[Ani grunts]

672
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,000
Please tell me you are.

673
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:48,916
Yeah.

674
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,500
It's long overdue.

675
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,208
Thankfully, the timing worked out.

676
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:56,041
We might be moving to London
after the wedding.

677
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,791
- [Mr. Larson] London?
- Yeah.

678
00:33:58,541 --> 00:34:01,666
Luke has been asked to run
BlackRock's European desk.

679

- Luke, congratulations.
- Thank you.

680
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,833
- [Whitney] Exciting.
- We're still figuring out the details.

681
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,750
Will you be able to write
for the magazine from over there?

682
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:16,500
Actually, I… just got accepted

683
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:19,458
into the Goldsmith's MFA program

684
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,333
- at the University of London.
- [Whitney] Ah!

685
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:22,791
To teach, I hope.

686
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,000
- Oh!
- [Whitney] Oh!

- It's a balancing act with him.

He doesn't trust
the director in skinny jeans.

710
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,458
So you acquiesce?

711

Am I allowed to call you a bastard now?

- [Luke] You know that, right?

It's one of the reasons
I want us to go to London.

I think you are limited where you are,
and frankly, you're better than it.

All I have to show
for the past nine years of my career

is 15,000 ways to touch a cock.

I wouldn't be going there for the money.

743
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,416
Well, this makes me think
they don't value you at all.

744
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,958
It's not personal. There's no money
left in publishing anymore.

[Luke chuckles] Well, exactly.

746
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,958
Listen, you go to London and get your MFA.
You can write a book.

747
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,208
Something that's yours,
that you have equity in.

748
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:55,125
Wouldn't you rather be known
for something you've created

749
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,625
than this thing
that happened to you so long ago?

750
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:00,791
No.

751
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:05,500
No, I… I wanna be remembered
for what really happened to me.

752
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,333
I want vindication.
It's all I think about.

753
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,625
I know you've thought long and hard
about doing this documentary,

754
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,208
and I'm not saying you shouldn't do it,

755
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,958
but Dean has taken this very bad thing
that happened to him

756
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:19,416
and done something good with it.
People respect that and they respect him.

757
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,166
You know what I'm saying.

758
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,166
Yeah.

759
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:28,250
Yeah, it's the blow-job editor
versus the gun-safety savior.

[Luke sighs]

761
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,166
No, God, of course. Ugh!

762
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh God, if there was just a way for me
to write about more important issues

763
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:37,416
for a place of worldwide
influence and acclaim,

764
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,750
then maybe, just maybe,

765
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,250
people can hold me
in the same esteem as Dean.

766
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:46,666
Gosh, if there was just a way
for me to work at this elusive place.

767
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,125
You're so angry. I can't talk to you
when you're this angry.

He's going to vindicate you, Ani.

00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:49,000
[Aaron] I've gathered enough
to know that that event

was framed as something
that you participated in. I'm…

I'm so sorry, Ani. It makes me sick.

if you wanna do this,

901
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:04,958
it'd be easy enough to tack on
an extra day to the schedule.

902
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:08,083
I'll make sure to keep you both separate

We do not wanna see you re-traumatized.

We could look into getting you
a victims' advocate.

909
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,291
Sorry. I should probably ask
if you prefer "survivor" to "victim."

Survivor? Gross.

You made a decision about London?

<i>just trying to get an education.</i>

941
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:27,875
[Ani's mom] TifAni?

942
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:29,333
[Dean] <i>It's outright negligence.</i>

943
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:30,708
What are you doing?

944
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:33,250
<i>- We owe these kids so much more.</i>
- I came to check on you.

945
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,166
Why?

946
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:37,458
[Ani's mom sighs]

947
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,875
[inhales deeply]

948
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,000
[exhales deeply]

949
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,333
My little<i> bambina.</i>

950
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:47,500
Really starting to freak out
about seeing Dean.

951
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:48,416
Right.

952
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,291
What if when I see him in a wheelchair,
I can't be angry anymore?

953
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,041
I don't wanna feel bad for him.

954
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,250
It's so much cleaner
if I could just hate him.

955
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,208
Oh.

956
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:02,000
[both sigh deeply]

957
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:06,208
I say we go out there
and get Drunken Ship-faced.

958
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:07,166
Hmm? [chuckles]

959
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:14,083
Come on. You're about
to read Dean Barton for fucking filth.

960
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:16,083
Where's the registry for that?

961
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:18,083
[woman] Where's the blushing bride?

962
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,625
[Ani groans]

963
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,958
Jesus Christ,
how am I gonna get through this?

964
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:27,000
[woman] Here comes the bride. Finally.

965
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,833
Hey, lady. Oh…

966
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:32,625
[Ani]<i> Hallsy's Luke's</i>
<i>poorly preserved aunt</i>

967
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:36,291
<i>who ceased to be a lady
20 tennis-pro dicks ago.</i>

968
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,708
Why is everyone so anti-oak these days?

969
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,875
Ooh! I have a buttery chard just for you.

970
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,333
About the only thing
California's good for.

971
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:48,875
And do me one more solid,
don't sit me with the Gilmartins.

972
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:51,875
- What'd you do this time?
- I didn't do anything.

973
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:54,291
They're being snowflakes
over the new park.

974
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:55,458
No offense, you two.

975
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:57,958
[Mrs. Harrison]
Well, it will be very loud for them.

976
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:00,416
They've agreed to put in
soundproof buffers.

977
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,833
What kind of a park
needs a soundproof buffer?

978
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:04,833
A shooting park, Dinah.

979
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:09,041
Can't blame gun owners for wanting
to enjoy their hobby responsibly.

980
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:11,750
As a woman, I feel more empowered
when I'm shooting a gun

981
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:14,166
than I do bitching
about every little thing.

982
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,500
[bangs table] Okay, I'm gonna go inside.
Would anybody like some water?

983
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,208
I'll take one. No ice.

984
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:22,875
[Ani]<i> Don't worry,</i>
<i>I won't sit you with the Gilmartins.</i>

985
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:23,916
<i>You'll be at table 12</i>

986
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,625
with the rest of the flabby cougars
where you belong.

987
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,041
- [Dinah] TifAni.
- [Nell] Oh, boy.

988
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:31,333
[Luke] Oh my God.

989
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,125
Oh fuck.

990
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,375
She's…

991
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,625
She's really tired.

992
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:51,000
It's been a long week, so…

993
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,625
[somber music playing]

994
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:57,708
[Dinah] Ani!

995
00:51:58,958 --> 00:51:59,791
Stop!

996
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,833
[seagulls squawking]

997
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:02,750
Ani.

998
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,208
Ow! Goddamn it!

999
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,666
[Dinah groans]

1000
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,708
Ani!

1001
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:11,791
Stop!

1002
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:14,500
Damn it.

1003
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,250
Do you like your life, TifAni?

1004
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:25,833
Yes, Mom, I have built
a very nice life for myself.

1005
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:28,041
How much do you make in a year?

1006
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:29,916
What?

1007
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,250
How much do you make in a year, honey?

1008
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:36,833
Uh… 80K.

1009
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:41,625
Sometimes a little bit more
if I guest-edit a brand extension, okay?

1010
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:44,166
Okay, so let's be generous.
Let's call it 90K.

1011
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:46,166
How much did you pay for that watch?

1012
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,125
You don't think I noticed
you got the Cartier?

1013
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:52,166
Don't you know it's gauche to ask
how much something costs, Mom?

1014
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,041
Oh, I know. I know you'd think
I didn't do anything with my life.

1015
00:52:56,833 --> 00:53:01,125
But you know, when you're spending
$1,500 a month to exercise,

1016
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:04,791
and your mortgage is $12,000…

1017
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:11,958
This 90k that I was able to squirrel away
from alimony payments

1018
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:16,000
so I could stay home with you
and not have to pay for childcare?

1019
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,666
I put that money towards your education,

1020
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:20,375
and that put you in rooms
where you met a guy like Luke.

1021
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:24,625
And I am… I am doing my best here

1022
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:27,416
to try to connect with the Harrisons.
It's not easy.

1023
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,333
And now with this documentary?

1024
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,458
- What's that have to do with this?
- Everything.

1025
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:35,208
Everything, TifAni. Everything.

1026
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:38,583
You think you're embarrassed of me now,
don't try to say that you're not,

1027
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,458
imagine what it's gonna be like
when they find out about what happened.

1028
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,291
They had boys.

1029
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:47,791
They didn't have a girl
who developed early

1030
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:50,000
and was hell-bent on taking risks.

1031
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:53,541
They can't imagine what that was like.

1032
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,875
I did everything in my power
to protect you.

1033
00:53:57,958 --> 00:53:59,416
I did. I did.

1034
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,041
That's why I had
all those rules in place that I did.

1035
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:04,208
But you didn't wanna follow those.

1036
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,875
That was your choice.

1037
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:08,416
So fine, you know?

1038
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,875
Just... just... just…

1039
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:12,750
At least just leave my name out of it.

1040
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:17,000
I did what any half-decent mother
would have done.

1041
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:18,458
I did.

1042
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,833
You'll find out someday.

1043
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:23,541
You'll find out how hard it is.

1044
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,416
Okay.

1045
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:29,833
Although if you keep pushing Luke away,
maybe you won't.

1046
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,458
At the very least, you won't have
someone else's pile of money to stand on

1047
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:35,166
while you call me gauche.

1048
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:37,833
Excuse me.

1049
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:44,625
TifAni.

1050
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:47,791
Wait.

1051
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:52,375
[Luke sighs]

1052
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,458
[Ani] I'm sorry.

[inhales sharply]

1055
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,375
My mom asked me what a cougar is.

1062
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,958
- [Ani grunting]
- [Luke] Ah!

1063
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,500
- [Ani moans]
- Okay.

1064
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:54,916
- [Ani grunts]
- Ow!

1065

[both breathing heavily]

1066
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,291
- Babe?
- Yeah?

1067
00:55:58,375 --> 00:55:59,208
[sighs]

1068
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:03,041
[exhales] Can we just do it the nice way?

1069
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,166
Yeah.

1070
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,875

00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,166
Okay.

1073
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:30,916
Okay.

1074
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:33,291
I can't do this. Please get off me.

1075
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,166
Please just get off of me.
I'm sorry. I can't…

1076
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:37,916
[sighs]

1077
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:39,750
Oh my God.

I may not say everything right,

1081
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:59,083
but when I try to be respectful,
it's like you can't handle it.

1082
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:02,958
[sighs]

1083
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,833
Thanks for taking me.

1084
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:15,291
You only have a 30% chance
of getting pregnant,

1085
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:17,125
but it's good to be on the safe side.

Oh.

1088
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:20,875
Never heard that before.

Liam?

1092
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,416
I just wanted you to know, I didn't mean
to hook up with anybody else.

1093
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
[chuckles] Dude, it's no big deal.

1094
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,375
But I also feel like…

1095
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,958
I think I was raped.

1096
00:57:58,833 --> 00:57:59,750
[scoffs]

1097
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:01,750
Are you insane?

1098

Are you actually insane? Like…

1099
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:10,500
Do you even know what rape is?

1100
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,166
[car stops]

1101
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,666
Why would you even say that to me?

1102
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,125
I'm sorry.
I… I don't think that about you.

1103
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,083
- Finny!
- There she is.

1104
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,125
- [boys laughing]
- [boys banging door]

1105
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:30,333
Finny, if I'm still hungover,
you're definitely still hungover.

1106
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:32,416
[Peyton] Hey, come on,
come on, come on. Let's go.

1107
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:34,166
Milady.

1108
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:39,708
You are an animal, FaNelli.

1109
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:42,791
Hey, you two… gotta step it up.

1110
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:44,750
- You are such a loser.
- Loser?

1111
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:47,625
- I think that was your job last night.
- Did you win any games at all?

1112
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:50,250
- [Hilary] Yeah, I won two. Yeah.
- [young Dean] I don't think so.

1113
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:53,583
I mean, if I'd lost as much as you had,
then I would have left long ago.

1114
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:55,833
Oh, come on.

1115
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
[somber music playing]

[somber music continues]

1120
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:34,541
"Oh, honey,
why do you have a cut on your lip?"

1121
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:39,625
"Hmm. It's 'cause I'm betrothed
to a sexual deviant, Mother."

1122

[seagulls squawking]

1124
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:56,416
[Mr. Larson]
TifAni, I've told Headmaster Mayer

1125
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,875
about the events
with the three boys this weekend.

1126
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:02,375
[Mr. Mayer] Are you talking about
reporting this, TifAni?

1127
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:03,458
[door lock clicks]

1128
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:07,083
How does that work? What happens?

1129
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:10,833
[Mr. Mayer] The boys
will be questioned by the police. [sighs]

1130
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:15,708
It will need to be disclosed on their
college applications, potentially.

1131
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:20,125
[inhales] If you decide to go that route,

1132
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:22,458
you need to be absolutely sure
what you're saying,

1133
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:26,041
and that can be difficult to determine
with so much alcohol involved.

1134
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:28,291
The situation has been obfuscated.

1135
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,333
There was no obfuscation,
Headmaster Mayer.

1136
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,750
She said no.

1137
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,916
[Mr. Mayer] Is that true? Did you say no?

1138
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
[somber music playing]

1139
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,291
I-I don't know.

1140
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:46,833
I don't know.

1141
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:49,916
I didn't want to.

1142
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:51,916
[breathing shakily]

1143
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,125
I said, "Ow."

1144
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,250
I just remember always saying, "Ow."

1145
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:58,958
I remember screaming at Dean. Uh…

1146
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:00,625
I tried to push Liam off of me,

1147
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:04,500
but he thought I was, like,
touching his face so he kissed me.

1148
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,041
He was really drunk too.

1149
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:12,333
[telephone clattering]

1150
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,416
[Mr. Mayer punching phone buttons]

1151
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:17,541
- What… What are you doing?
- [Mr. Mayer] I'm calling your mom.

1152
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,791
Legally, I can't contact
the police regarding a minor

1153
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,791
unless the guardian is informed.

1154

[telephone clattering]

1155
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,291
[inhales sharply] Stop.

1156
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:31,625
Stop.

1157
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,833
No.

1158
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:36,875
No.

1159
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,625
I changed my mind.

1160
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,958
[panting]

1161
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,666
[doorknob clattering]

1162
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:56,666
Mr. Larson got fired. [breathing heavily]

1163
01:01:57,541 --> 01:01:59,750
They said he shouldn't
have let us leave the school dance.

1164
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:03,208
[Arthur] He's the scapegoat.
Dean's fucking untouchable.

1165
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,583
Come in.

1166
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:14,041
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1167
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:15,708
Um, that… that belonged to his dad.

1168
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:18,833
Yeah. Legacy to Columbia
and a surefire way out of this hellscape

1169
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:20,375
is the only thing he ever gave me.

1170
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:22,000
- Want some?
- No.

1171
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,416
[young Ani] I can't breathe.

1172
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:28,833
Should we tell her?

1173
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:31,500
Tell me what?

1174
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:33,250
Um…

1175
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:36,666
- Ar-Arthur, can we… can we just not?
- Come on, we're among friends.

1176
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:39,375
Two summers ago, Dean and Peyton showed up

1177
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:41,666
to Kelsey Quick's
eighth grade graduation party.

1178
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,916
They were all 16 and fucked up
and, you know, like...

1179
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,333
- I thought that they were being nice.
- Oh, they were not being nice.

1180
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:49,041
They said they wanted to smoke up with us.

1181
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:52,833
You always leave that part out to make me
look like I'm a fucking idiot for going.

1182
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:55,166
Going where?

1183
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,083
Well, into the woods,
where Peyton pinned Ben to the ground,

1184
01:02:58,166 --> 01:02:59,916
and Dean took a shit on Ben's chest.

1185
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,541
I heard that he ate
a burrito that day in preparation.

1186
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:05,625
Fuck you, Arthur!
You're such a fucking prick, man.

1187
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,458
Yeah, okay.
Then he ran straight to Suburban Square,

1188
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:11,416
went to the Rite Aid,
bought a pack of razors,

1189
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,166
and slit his wrists in the bathroom.

1190
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,083
[door closing]

1191
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,541
Is that really true?

1192
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,458
Yeah.

1193
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:24,791
What? He obviously didn't cut deep enough
to do any real damage.

1194
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:27,583
His parents sent him off to make
macaroni art for the rest of the summer.

1195
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:30,916
Why are you like that to him?
You're acting like you're mad at him.

1196
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,166
- I am fucking mad at him.
- Why?

1197
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,666
He didn't do anything about it.

1198
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,208
I mean, it's gotta be a crime,
biological warfare.

1199
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,791
He just wanted it dropped.

1200
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:47,250
And now here it is happening again,

1201
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:48,916
and here you are,

1202
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,583
keeping that runway free and clear
for it to keep happening.

1203
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:01,750
My mom can't know.

1204
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:04,458
She would hate me.

1205
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,541
Okay. Yeah, that's what everybody thinks.

1206
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:09,833
My ass got suspended, my mommy
still thinks the sun shines out of it.

1207
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:12,708
No. You don't understand what she's like.

1208
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:15,458
Yeah, I really don't.

1209
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:19,541
What kind of mother doesn't strap
those babies into a cable knit?

Oh good, another cable knit.

[laughs]

1215
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:43,958
- You like this for the first dance, right?
- No.

1216
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:46,875
- What? I thought we agreed?
- No. No, we never agreed.

01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:48,625
- We sure did.
- Oh my God! [laughs]

- Do not play.

1225

- [new song pops on]
- Definitely do not play.

- You don't like this song?
- No, I…

- No.

Come on, hit me. No one's gonna stop you.
No one ever stops you.

[Arthur] Shit.

1263
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:34,833
[Peyton] Dean, go. Go!
Get the fuck out of here.

1264
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:35,875
[girl 2] Go.

[teacher groaning]

1268
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:47,666
Ow!

1269
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:53,166
You didn't know it was Mrs. Hurst.
Why can't you just apologize?

1270
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,375
Oh, like you did? And everything
is just peachy keen for you now?

1271
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:59,583
Oh, come on,
it's better than getting expelled.

1272
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,041
Think you're gonna get into Columbia now?

1273
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:04,750
Okay, kindly adjust your tone, young lady.

1274
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:07,083
I was standing up for my friend.

1275

[sighs]

1276
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:12,750
I know.

1277
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:19,708
Thank you.

[inhales sharply]

1279
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I don't want you to thank me,

1280
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:27,333
I want you to act
like you have a smidge of dignity.

1281
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:29,750
Just a tiny microscopic smidge.

1282
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:32,500
I mean, you have to have
that much at least, right?

1283
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:38,500
[sighs]

1284
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:42,291
You can't be mad at me.
I didn't ask you to do any of this.

1285
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:44,000
You should be mad at you.

1286
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,541
You had a chance to take him down,
and you didn't

1287
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:49,291
'cause you're so fucking desperate
to redeem yourself.

1288
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:53,625
- You sound so fucking stupid right now.
- Yeah, I'm the stupid one.

1289
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:57,291
I'm not gonna take Dean down.
It doesn't fucking work like that, Arthur.

1290
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:00,666
You apologized to Liam, for fuck's sake.

1291
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,125
You apologized to your own fucking rapist.

1292
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:06,083
I mean, seriously,
how can you live with yourself?

1293
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:10,416
[young Ani] Fuck you.

1294
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:12,125
TifAni, wait, no.

1295
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,666
TifAni, wait. TifAni.

1296
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:20,708
[young Ani] Here.
You're such a fucking loser.

[pensive music continues]

1308

Just up here.

1309

Uh, if you need anything,
you can feel free to tell me.

[Aaron] Okay, uh, Ani, you ready?

1314
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,291
Can you tell us your personal experience
of that tragic day?

1315

Whenever you're ready.

1316
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,666
You know, I… I always thought

1317
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,375
the most vulnerable
you'll ever see a person is from behind.

had blonde hairs</i>

was dark and coarse, when he jumped.</i>

Yes.

[Ani] <i>I wanted revenge too.</i>

Was it just this total collective relief?

You know… we all came together
at that moment,
