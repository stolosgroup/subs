<i> "It began as a prank</i>

00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,041
Fantastic choice.

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,458
I love this one.

5
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,833
It's trash.

6
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,708
Low-brow horror.

7
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,416
It's for my stepdaughter.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,583
That'll be $2.95.

Thank you for shopping at B. Dalton's.

<i>The Shadyside Mall is now closed.</i>

Hello, this is B. Dalton's. We're closed.

15
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,791
OK, since when do <i>you </i>work late?

16
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,583
Since my mom used her last paycheck
on scratch tickets

17
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,208
instead of the gas bill.

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,250
Hello?

19
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:18,916
Ryan?

20
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,416
Ryan? Are you there?

21
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,000
Ryan? Hello?

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,083
Hello, Ryan!

23
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,083
Night.

24
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,541
- All alone now!
- Jesus Christ!

25
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,125
Woo-hoo!

26
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,875
Ryan! What the hell, dude!

27
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,250
Forgive me.

28
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,500
I do need a ride tonight.

29
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,958
That's what she said.

30
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,750
You are disgusting.

31
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,833
And, yes, I don't want to walk home alone.

32
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:09,583
Fine. Just give me and, uh… Jasmine here
15 minutes to close up.

33
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,541
You gave her a name.

34
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,500
Yeah, I thought, uh… "Big Tits"
was kind of deflating her ego.

35
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,958
- <i>Ryan…</i>
- What?

36
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,791
I didn't say anything, weirdo.

37
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,875
Hello?

38
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,750
OK. Very funny, asshole.

39
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,583
I'm spooked, OK? You win.

40

00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,833
<i>Ma'am, if you don't answer,
I'm gonna dispatch help.</i>

53
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,333
Hey!

54
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,750
Help! Help!

55
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,166
Help!

56
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,458
Ah!

57
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,833
Ah, ah!

58
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,541
Ryan?

59
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,625
Please! It's me. It's me.

- Dude! What the hell?
- This isn't yours, dillweed!

94
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,416
Oh, I get it.
You building a shrine or something?

95
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,900
Alright, you know what?
It's time for school. Get in the car.

96
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,791
Let me finish this chat.

97
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,125
Deena, be careful with that!

98
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,416
Dad said you weren't allowed on this.
Know how expensive AOL is?

99
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,541
I'm stealing it. I'm talking to someone!

100
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,416
This internet bullshit
is exactly why you have no friends.

101
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,208
It's not bullshit.
It's a community dedicated to the truth.

102
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,208
Look, some guy went crazy and killed
a bunch of people at the mall last night.

103
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,875
Holy shit.

104
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,625
It was all over the news.

105
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,000
Skull mask killer.

106
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,666
But, of course, the media won't talk
about the most important part.

107
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,208
Josh, I am telling you calmly,

108
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,625
step out of your internet fantasy
nerd land and get in the car.

109
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,250
Step out your depressoid
"I'm gonna die alone" land,

110
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,208
and stop obsessing about Sam!

111
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,916
Get in the car!

112
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,375
See you later, Sir Silence.

113
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:10,166
Up, up, down, down.
Left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

114
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,500
Watch it, nerd.

115
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,333
Jeez.

116
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,583
You see? It's the witch.

117
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,958
Sarah Fier's back.

118
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,916
Oh, Christ. Not you too.

119
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,208
"She reaches from beyond the grave
to make good men her wicked slaves!"

120
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,976
- "She'll take your blood!"
- Simon!

121
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,500
"She'll take your head.
She'll follow you until you're dead!"

122
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,791
Wow!

123
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,375
You guys are dicks.

124
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,333
- It's just fun.
- It's sick.

125
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,416
What? The dude was wearing
a Halloween skull mask!

126
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,458
How is that not fun?

127
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,083
People died.

128
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,500
Heather died.

129
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:38,708
The dude was probably just some sad sack
who hated his life, like the rest of us,

130
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,916
except he decided, "Hey,
why don't I get out of here for good?"

131
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,708
And, "Hey, why don't I take Heather
and a couple other mall rats with me?"

132
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,666
There's no angry dead witch
who made him go postal.

133
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,541
The only thing that made him go crazy
is this town!

134
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,041
Are you OK?

135
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,250
Yeah, I'm fine.

136
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,500
Seems like…
maybe you got a little witch in you.

137
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,375
Dude, why are you even in here?
This is the girls' bathroom.

138
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,000
Candy store.

139
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,625
You know we don't believe
this witch shit, right?

140
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,583
It's just, like, fucked-up Santa Claus
or something.

141
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,041
Ho, ho, ho!

142
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,666
- What's this?
- I need you to give this to Sam tonight.

143
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,833
- Yeah, uh-uh. No way.
- Come on, Kate!

144
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,375
No way, Deena.

145
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,875
I am not getting mixed up
in your ex drama. Do it yourself.

146
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,875
I'm not going to the game. I quit band.

147
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,541
- Since when?
- Since who gives a shit!

148
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,875
Was band the only extracurricular
you had left?

149
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,666
You still have your band uniform, right?

150
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,333
You just wear that shit one last time.

151
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,000
I've got something
that'll give you the balls to face Sam.

152
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:57,583
What? You're dealing again? I thought you
stopped after this dingus's brother OD'd.

153
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,083
Timothy?

154
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,708
Wh… Uh… Timmy wasn't a real OD.

155
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,000
He didn't actually die.

156
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,708
They brought him back.

157
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,375
Ja-jing!

158
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,041
You're both morons.

159
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,583
Which one of us is valedictorian, again?

160
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,541
President of every club
this shithole has to offer.

161
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm getting out of here. Off to claim
my place among the stars, bitch.

162
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,291
Woo! The witch lives!
Long live Sarah Fier!

163
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,458
Woo!

164
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,250
Woo!

165
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,541
Yeah!

166
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,708
Before tonight's game,

167
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,750
out of respect
for last night's tragic events,

168
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,000
Sunnyvale will host
a candlelight vigil for the victims.

169
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,625
All player, cheer and band attendance
is mandatory.

170
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,666
Oh, really? Come on!

171
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,750
Didn't you quit?

172
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,833
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>how I wanted to be here tonight.</i>

173
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,333
I wanted to be here as a fan.

174
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,333
Our Sunnyvale Devils
and your Shadyside Witches

175
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,083
throwing down
some good old American football.

176
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,458
Instead I find myself here

177
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,625
as a husband,

178
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,833
a father, as a neighbor.

179
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,416
And, yes,

180
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,333
mayor of Sunnyvale.

181
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,791
And on behalf of all of the people
in my town,

182
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:26,875
I say all of Sunnyvale mourns with you.

183
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,416
Yeah, really looks like they give a damn.

184
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,791
The only Sunnyvalers who came
were the ones who had to.

185
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,583
The football team and the cheerleaders.

186
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,125
Our hearts are broken with grief.

187
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,250
Sam.

188
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,333
I didn't think you were coming.

189
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,958
I thought you quit band.

190
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, I did. Here.

191
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,666
What…

192
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,500
Is this my stuff?

193
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,625
Ding ding ding.

194
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,875
My family's been
in Sunnyvale for generations,

195
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,958
and now my brother is mayor

196
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,000
and I your sheriff.

197
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,541
We've prospered here.

198
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,791
And yet, I've seen you,
our neighbors in Shadyside,

199
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,291
suffer tragedy after tragedy.

200
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:21,458
It's easy in times like this
to drown in questions of why…

201
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,083
Why this happened.

202
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,666
But I know too well

203
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,000
there are no answers
that will provide relief.

204
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,875
There's no peace found in the past.

205
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,250
- Can we talk for a second?
- No.

206
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,500
You broke up with me! Remember?
So stop acting like I'm the bad guy.

207
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,625
Yeah, well, I'm not the one
who moved to Sunnyvale.

208
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,583
OK, you made the choice.
I just made it official.

209
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,458
My parents got divorced.

210
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,083
I didn't have a choice.

211
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,500
Oh, come on!

212
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,541
You just couldn't wait to start
your new fake life with your fake-ass mom!

213
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,000
I am half an hour away.

214
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,458
It might as well be the goddamn moon,
and you know it.

215
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,458
I don't know anything.

216
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,875
Yeah. Well, I do.

217
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,958
I know you were always too afraid
to tell anyone about us.

218
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,125
I know that.

219
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:15,166
And I know that douchebag out there
was squeezing your ass.

220
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,250
- You broke up with me.
- What's his name?

221
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,875
- You broke up with me!
- What's his name, Sam?

222
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,125
- The dude groping you.
- Stop. Stop!

223
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,250
- Touching you!
- Peter!

224
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,041
His name is Peter!

225
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,791
We must not fall into darkness.

226
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,833
We must look to the light.

227
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,250
Yeah!
What we should do is light a fuse

228
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,041
and burn down Shittyside.

229
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,333
What'd you say?

230
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,291
- You don't get it!
- No, no. I do.

231
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:47,500
There's not much of a future
in Shadyside with a lesbo.

232
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,166
Best case is what?

233
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,541
Dead on the mall floor
after a double shift,

234
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,875
or maybe, maybe if you're really lucky,
you're the one carrying the knife.

235
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,041
I said it ain't a tragedy
when it happens every week.

236
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,416
It's a joke.

237
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,083
Jesus. You're doing it again.

238
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,250
<i>Doing what?</i>

239
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,791
- "Welcome to the suck!" "Shit is doomed!"
- Shit is doomed!

240
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,416
<i>It doesn't have to be.</i>

241
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,416
- It's like you want to lose.
- At least I know who I am.

242
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,333
Stop being mad at me
for wanting a different future.

243
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,791
It's not your future
if you're pretending to be someone else.

244
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,916
Say that again, motherfucker!

245
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,958
Stop!

246
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,125
You little green prick!
Come here, you little bitch! Come here!

247
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,500
Suck it in...

248
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,875
- Pieces of shit!
- Yeah!

249
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,875
- They think they can do what they want!
- No!

250
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,291
They ruin our vigil,
then go waltzing back to their mansions,

251
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,416
like we're some reject pile
that they can step on!

252
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
No!

253
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:05,583
Well, we are not the reject pile!

254
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,500
- No!
- This shit ends tonight!

255
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,625
- Yeah!
- What are we gonna do?

256
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,333
We're gonna go kill those preppy assholes!

257
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,250
Yeah!

258
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:19,291
Kate! Kate! Kate!

259
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,583
Kate! Kate!

260
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,583
When I say Shady, you say side!

261
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,333
- Shady!
- Side!

262
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,083
When I say Shady, you say side!

263
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,750
- Shady!
- Side!

264
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,666
When I say Shady, you say side!

265
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,250
- Shady!
- Side!

266
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,041
Goddamn Sunnyvalers.

267
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,708
Yeah! Where are you going?

268
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,750
Guys! Come here! Come here!

269
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,541
- Shady!
- Side!

270
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,083
Woo!

271
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,458
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Hey, isn't that, uh…

272
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,250
Sam.

273
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,333
Where are you going, you pussies?

274
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,000
Sunnyvale sucks!

275
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,500
- Peter, stop! What are you doing?
- Chill out!

276
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,416
Open the door!

277
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,583
Open the door!

278
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,625
This is definitely a good idea, right?
Deena?

279
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,125
On three, OK?

280
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,541
- Are you sure?
- One, two…

281
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,208
- Deena!
- What?

282
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:44,833
Your nose!

283
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:53,250
Stop! Stop the bus!

284
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Whew.

285
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,541
Shit, are you alive?

286
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,875
Yeah, I'm alive. Yeah.

287
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:16,416
Sam! What… what are you doing?

288
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:21,875
Sam!

289
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Sam!

290
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,625
Sam!

291
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,541
Are you OK? Oh!

292
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,666
I'm so… I'm sorry.

293
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,333
Stay away from her, you bull dyke freak!

294
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,166
Sam, it's me. I'm here.

295
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,625
Did you… see?

296
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,500
What?

297
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,083
Oh shit!

298
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:20,166
OK, we should not be down here.

299
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,291
- Shut up, help me carry her!
- We need to leave, like ten minutes ago.

300
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,750
- We have to clear her airway.
- Quit it!

301
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,958
Hey! I got this. Chill out.

302
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,625
I got this.

303
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:35,125
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.

304
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,791
See? She's fine.

305
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,833
- Oh, my God!
- Oh. Ugh!

306
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:43,416
What the fuck?

307
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,583
- Deena Johnson?
- Yeah, two E's.

308
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,708
Wanna tell me what happened?

309
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,000
The car crashed.

310
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,000
Was it pursuing you?

311
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:14,875
Well, it was driving behind the bus.
Does that count as pursuing?

312
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:18,875
The driver said that before the crash
someone opened the emergency exit.

313
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,291
I don't remember that.

314
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,291
No?

315
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,416
He also saw you with the cooler.

316
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,916
Did anyone else see that?

317
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:31,166
Maybe you were just, um… goofing around.

318
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,333
Things got out of hand.

319
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:36,666
- Why don't you tell me what happened?
- I don't know.

320
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,166
I guess…

321
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,041
Sometimes accidents just happen.

322
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,666
We lost control, sir.

323
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,083
Freak accident.

324
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,875
Suck it, pig.

325
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,916
It was just an accident.

326
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,125
Alright.

327
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:54,000
Well, if you do think of anything,

328
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:55,625
give me a call.

329
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,625
I'm on your side.

330
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,666
Yeah, totally.

331
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,000
My car is totaled.

332
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,041
Well, Daddy will buy you a new one.

333
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,166
Shittyside trash.

334
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,166
You are all fucking… dead.

335
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,458
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Yeah?

336
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:21,000
Do it before Dad gets here,
he's gonna murder <i>you!</i>

337
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:25,041
You know the cops called him at work
about some accident last night?

338
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,250
Please get out of my room.

339
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,625
You get out of your room.
You've been in your bed all day!

340
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:31,833
Get up!

341
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,458
<i>I'm here</i>
<i>with Martin P. Franklin,</i>

342
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,958
<i>Shadyside Mall Janitor.</i>

343
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,916
<i>- Martin, what do you know?</i>
<i>- He was a normal dude.</i>

344
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,666
<i>Always thought he would, like, just go
home and read a comic book or whatever.</i>

345
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,250
<i>He was chill, just snapped I guess.</i>

346
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,750
<i>A baffling development</i>

347
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:02,041
<i>as mall employee Ryan Torres
has been identified as the killer.</i>

348
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,333
<i>A recent graduate of Shadyside High</i>

349
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:07,333
<i>an ordinary guy who,
as those who knew him attest,</i>

350
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,000
<i>just seemed to snap.</i>

351
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,791
<i>East Union Medical.</i>

352
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,708
Hi. Uh, Samantha Fraser's room, please?

353
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,833
Josh! Get the door!

354
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:30,916
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Uh… Hi, uh, Mrs. Fraser.

355
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,500
I'm sorry. Uh, Miss… Ms…

356
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,583
Hi, um…

357
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,333
Is Sam there? I just…

358
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,750
- I wanted to see how she was doing.
<i>- Deena?</i>

359
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,208
Yeah. Hi.

360
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,500
I was just w… worried about her and...

361
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:50,375
<i>You won't stop until you've</i>
<i>ruined her life completely, will you?</i>

362
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:53,458
<i>She's fine. Don't call here again.</i>

363
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,416
Josh!

364
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,333
Hello?

365
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,375
Oh, hey, Peter!

366
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,416
See you got the full costume now!

367
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,708
Hey!

368
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:49,041
- Pizza ready?
- Oh, <i>that </i>ringing you heard.

369
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:50,875
What?

370
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,958
I have priorities.

371
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,291
Jeez.

372
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,291
Shit! Hot, hot, hot!

373
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,750
Sunnyvale prick.

374
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,458
Holy shit!

375
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:17,583
Stay here.

376
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,500
You're pathetic!

377
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,333
Four in each bag.

378
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,666
If you finish in an hour,

379
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,958
I'll let you watch
<i>My So-Called Life</i> with me.

380
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,000
And, uh, do not eat these.

381
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,125
These will make your little hearts stop,
you'll choke to death on vomit

382
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,500
and everyone will be so, so super sad.

383
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,208
Got it?

384
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:56,166
<i>Bob, easy with that blood.</i>
<i>It's our last can!</i>

385
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,541
What happened to sorting this?

386
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,958
Lights and darks,
and watch for stray socks.

387
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,625
- Remind me what's in it for me again?
- Nope.

388
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,416
You still wearing
the clothes from last night?

389
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,458
Did you wear that to the grocery store?

390
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:16,458
I had to work a double shift
and this was all I had in the car.

391
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,666
So, yes. Yes, I am.

392
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,541
Oh.

393
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,208
That's disgusting. You're disgusting.

394
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:30,541
- <i>Alright, kiddo?</i>
<i>- There I was at ten…</i>

395
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,166
Hey, lady-killer.

396
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,458
<i>Where are you?</i>

397
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,041
Babysitting. Look out the window.

398
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:43,000
That prick Peter is screwing with me.

399
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,250
Sam's boyfriend? What the hell?

400
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:50,125
Yeah, he's creeping around our house
in one of those skull masks. It's fucked.

401
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,958
I gotta go. Call you back.

402
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,666
Jesus! Put something on!

403
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,916
What? Make up your mind, woman!

404
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:08,916
Stay here.

405
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,125
- Maybe this isn't a good id...
- Shh!

406
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,916
Hey, creeper. What the f...

407
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,416
- Are you crazy?
- It's just that Sunnyvale asshole.

408
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,333
Thank you so much.

409
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:16,000
Oh, no. I'm so happy to have the company.

410
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,166
- You're a lifesaver, Mrs. Lane.
- I used to be a nurse.

411
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,333
Are you… you sure everything's OK?

412
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,625
Totally! I just have to run out and…

413
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:34,875
Kill that pervert!

414
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:39,833
Why would he break in there?
I just don't understand what he was doing.

415
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:42,625
He was acting all shifty and shit.

416
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,541
Like going through the laundry.

417
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,833
You need to get some groceries, man.

418
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:51,708
- We have an incredible sale at the store...
- He broke into the house! He had a knife!

419
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:55,083
Whoa! With the kids there? That's wack!

420
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,625
That's fucking right, Josh.

421
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,333
It is wack. Thank you.

422
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,875
There were kids there. OK, and what?

423
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,708
He thinks because he's balling Sam,

424
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,333
he can come and prank us on our own turf.

425
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,583
Hey, you know what?
You're right. Fuck this.

426
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,708
- Fuck Peter.
- Hello?

427
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:15,166
Don't forget the most important part.
Fuck Sam.

428
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:20,208
Yeah, fuck her. She needs to get
her psycho boyfriend in check.

429
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,375
Oh!

430
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,250
You coming or what?

431
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,166
Hey, slow down, lover boy!

432
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,125
- Fill these out and take a seat.
- No, I'm just visiting.

433
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,625
Visiting hours ends at nine.

434
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:56,708
Tell Nurse Beddy she has a patient.

435
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,583
Beddy. Long time, how you been?

436
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:09,541
- Still toting around with this moron.
- She can't quit me, Beddy. Too pretty!

437
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,750
Listen, we need your assistance.

438
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:17,625
I'm sure that you do, but there happens
to be a new security protocol.

439
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,208
We kept coming up short
on blueberries and bananas.

440
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:23,666
- So now I need a special key...
- I need to see a patient.

441
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,458
Blueberries and bananas?

442
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,375
Vicodin and Percocet.

443
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:38,375
You want anything from the machine?
I'm starving.

444
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,291
Cute sweatshirt.

445
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,708
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

446
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,208
I honestly have no clue.

447
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:02,458
Oh, Jesus. This game?

448
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,958
- What game? What are you talking about?
- About your dipshit boyfriend.

449
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:10,750
- He threatened, "You're all fucking dead."
- That didn't mean anything.

450
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,708
Now tonight, he's stalking around,
messing with us.

451
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,166
He broke into the house
where Kate was babysitting.

452
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,750
No. Peter's been here.

453
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,958
You need to call him
and tell him to back off.

454
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:24,416
Good news. They're gonna transfer
you out of this shithole tomorrow.

455
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,625
Perfect timing, asshole.

456
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,208
Where's your stupid mask?

457
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,833
Yo, Si-Money. Cash me.

458
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,833
Don't look at me, dude.
I'm… I'm… I'm broke.

459
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,416
You got any change?

460
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,416
Oh, um…

461
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:45,958
Let me check.

462
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,791
Um…

463
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,666
Uh… Uh, no.

464
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,875
Uh, but I…

465
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:01,916
What do you want?

466
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,666
He has been with me all night!

467
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,416
- Stop covering for him! He's a bad guy.
- You're out of control!

468
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,500
You put me in the hospital!
Now you're here yelling at me...

469
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:17,958
OK. No, that was an accident.
Look, I got a nosebleed.

470
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:21,083
- I didn't actually mean...
- A nosebleed? Stop making excuses!

471
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:23,625
You are total chaos!

472
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,166
And you have always been!

473
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:30,333
So don't blame me when you wake up
in ten years just like your dad!

474
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,916
Old and drunk and going nowhere!

475
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
OK, first, go to hell.

476
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:38,791
Second, yeah.
Congrats on getting out of Shadyside, Sam.

477
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:42,958
All you had to do was suck it up,
literally, and swallow some Sunnyvale...

478
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:46,166
You know what?
I never want to see you again!

479
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,333
Great. Have a nice goddamn life!

480
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,166
Oh my God!

481
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:09,041
- Where'd you learn how to do this?
- Oh, a lot of people trade hacks online.

482
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,250
Nerd.

483
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,875
So, um…

484
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,916
…when'd you get into the fruit business?

485
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:18,750
What?

486
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,291
Um… The, uh… drugs.

487
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:25,416
Oh, that's just temporary.
Saving up to get out of here.

488
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,041
Take me with you.

489
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:36,958
Run!

490
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,875
Did they get back together?

491
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:51,000
<i>Tonight's </i>Unsolved Mysteries,
<i>the story of a lonely housewife…</i>

492
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,000
- Where are the keys? Do you have the keys?
- No!

493
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,416
Where… where are the keys?

494
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,458
Come on. The ambulance!

495
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,666
- No!
- You can't wear that mask. What are...

496
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,500
Look out!

497
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:56,333
Come on!

498
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,875
- Come on! Let's go!
- Come on!

499
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:04,708
What the…

500

<i>Mall employee</i>
<i>Ryan Torres has been identified</i>

501
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,708
<i>as the killer in the mall massacre.</i>

502
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,458
Deena! Come on! Deena!

503
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:16,250
- Deena! Hurry up! Let's go!
- Go! Go!

504
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,059
- We have to go now!
- Hurry!

505
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,750
You have access to the mall.
You are still employed there, correct?

506
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:30,416
I'mma tell you again.
Somebody planted that.

507
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,083
Those ain't my cans.

508
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,250
You're right, Martin. These…

509
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:39,041
are actually my cans.

510
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,375
Why would I tag my own place of work?

511
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,291
Come on, man!

512
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,000
Martin, around here,
people show a little respect.

513
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,541
They call me Sheriff Goode.

514
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,583
Sheriff Goode?

515
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,250
More like Sheriff motherfucking Evil!

516
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,583
I'm telling you, it was him!

517
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,833
The psycho killer
my colleague shot dead, huh?

518
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,291
Yes! That's what we keep saying!

519
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,833
- What's wrong with you?
- Officer Kapinski.

520
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,041
You told me to come to you.

521
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:17,166
We should not be this close to
the police station in a stolen ambulance.

522
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,916
We're hiding in plain sight.

523
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,458
Yeah, just like Bundy.

524
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,875
Ted Bundy, when he was stalking
his victims, I mean.

525
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,666
OK, didn't he get caught though?

526
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:35,791
- Well, no. Well, yeah, but...
- Figure this out. I'm gonna take a leak.

527
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,416
Why do you know so much about killers?

528
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,416
Know thy enemy, right?

529
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:52,125
- You hang onto any of that candy?
- Yeah.

530
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,083
Then his mask came off.

531
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,125
And you saw him?

532
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,375
Yeah. Yeah, the mall killer, Ryan Torres.

533
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:09,958
That's Ryan Torres.

534
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,041
Yes!

535
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,125
Yes, that's him.

536
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:17,416
I know, but you guys must have made
a mistake or something. Look…

537
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,083
- I know what I saw.
- OK.

538
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:24,791
Let me get the right paperwork.

539
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,458
"Dead killer chasing…"

540
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,333
Would you say he was more, uh,
<i>Dawn of the Dead</i>

541
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:33,500
or <i>Night of the Living Dead?</i>

542
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,416
Wait.

543
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,750
- You don't believe us?
- This was a waste of time.

544
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:41,375
We've had prank calls, we've had reports
of skeleton mask copycats all weekend.

545
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:44,666
Got a call from the hospital.
Lady sounded worked up.

546
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:52,500
Uh… wait, I'll… I got it.
Take care of them.

547
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:34,916
This is bullshit. There are bodies
at the hospital. You're gonna see...

548
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,583
Honey, we are so appreciative of this tip.

549
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:40,916
- The killer is still out there!
- We'll do our damnedest to catch him.

550
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,750
You're a monster!
You're supposed to protect us!

551
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:47,500
Hey, hey! Young lady, do not test me!

552
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,875
I'm so sorry, sir.

553
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:52,166
I have no idea what came over me.

554
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,291
Get out of here!

555
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:59,458
Go find your boyfriends!
Tell them you need to relax!

556
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,500
Hey.

557
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,750
Do… do you need help? What the…

558
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,625
Deena, slow down!

559
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,291
- What are you doing?
- Just walk, fast.

560
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:39,916
We need to leave.

561
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,625
I think we should stay. We're safe here.
What if that psycho shows up again?

562
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:45,958
- Then we'll be ready.
- What the hell?

563
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,583
Deena, what is that?

564
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,958
Is that the cop's? You stole a cop's gun?

565
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,500
Fuck yeah she did!

566
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:54,166
- You out of your goddamn mind?
- They didn't believe us.

567
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,416
We're on our own.

568
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,708
Where the hell is Simon?

569
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:30,208
Simon, come on!

570
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:32,416
- Come on!
- Go! Go! Let's go!

571
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,083
Go! Come on!

572
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,916
- Come on!
- Sam! Come on! Run!

573
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:44,541
It doesn't make sense.
It's… it's not possible.

574
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:47,000
- Bullets didn't stop her.
- Amazing observation.

575
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:50,291
- Who the hell was that?
- How the hell should I know? She…

576
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:53,625
She was hot! I don't know!
The bitch seemed normal!

577
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,166
I hate to break it to you,

578
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,791
but normal bitches
don't bleed black fucking blood!

579
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,875
Well, she was hot and normal

580
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,625
until she attacked me
with a fucking razor blade!

581
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,958
Wait. What… A razor?

582
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:12,375
Yeah, for like old-timey shaving,
or in this case, I guess, slitting her...

583
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:15,416
Wrists. She slashed her wrists.

584
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,458
Was she singing something?

585
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:22,458
Was she singing a song, like an oldie…
like an oldie song?

586
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:26,041
Jesus, Rain Man.
How the fuck do you know that?

587
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,125
This is Ruby Lane.

588
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,291
- The girl who attacked you.
- Holy shit!

589
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42,000
She sang as she murdered her boyfriend,

590
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:45,458
her friends, then she killed herself.
Slashed her wrists.

591
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:48,333
Jesus. Yeah, why didn't I see this
on the news?

592
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:50,458
Because it happened 30 years ago.

593
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:53,041
1965.

594
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:03,458
Ruby is one of Shadyside's killers,
just like Skull Mask.

595
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:06,791
Ryan? Please!

596
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:09,125
I mean Ryan Torres.

597
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:11,208
Look, 1978.

598
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:13,208
Sixteen years ago.

599
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:17,916
- "Masked psycho murders kids at..."
- Camp Nightwing.

600
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,458
Yeah, my mom's sister was there.

601
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,458
That screwed my family up for a long time.

602
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,041
1950,

603
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,708
Harry Rooker,

604
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:28,625
local milkman slashes
a bunch of housewives.

605
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:31,291
1935, Humpty Dumpty Killer.

606
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:34,875
1922, Billy Barker.

607
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:39,000
1904, Grifter guts girls, and on and on.

608
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:42,916
It happens in Shadyside over and over.
Normal people turn into psychos.

609
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Jesus.

610
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,416
Look at this guy.

611
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,208
That's the pastor, Cyrus Miller.

612
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:55,000
1666. He was the first one recorded.

613
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,083
He, um… killed kids
and cut out their eyes.

614
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:10,291
Sam?

615
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:17,708
I, uh, brought you…

616
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:24,166
- I always liked this sweater.
- Yeah, I know.

617
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,708
If you get blood on it, I'll kill you.

618
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:31,333
What's happening to us?

619
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,583
There are people trying to kill us.

620
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:38,250
Dead people,
if you believe my weirdo brother.

621
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,125
That's not what I meant.

622
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,125
Yeah, I know.

623
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,250
Look, I know I always give you shit
for pretending you're someone you're not,

624
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,375
but it's…

625
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:54,083
It's not really easy for me to…

626
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:58,875
you know, be like us… either.

627
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:04,208
- Are you giving me a pass?
- No.

628
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:11,958
Fine. I'm not gonna say
what I was gonna say.

629
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:13,083
Say it.

630
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:19,750
Maybe you're… you're right.

631
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,500
Maybe shit is doomed.

632
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:26,125
I mean, here we are.
We're together for one night and...

633
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,458
Dead people are trying to kill us.

634
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:30,333
<i>None of this is random.</i>

635
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:33,375
It's Sarah Fier.

636
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:35,583
She's turning Shadysiders into killers.

637
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:37,583
Do you really believe that?

638
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:41,083
No one actually thinks
that this witch shit is real.

639
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:44,291
Yeah, it's something babysitters make up
to scare kids.

640
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:45,750
No, no. Just listen to me.

641
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:50,083
1666, Sarah Fier was hanged
for witchcraft, fact.

642
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:53,333
But ever since she was executed,
she's been possessing people,

643
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,958
turning them into killers,
to take revenge on the town.

644
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:59,000
- It's like the nursery rhyme.
- Yeah. Yeah.

645
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:03,083
"Before the witch's final breath,
she found a way to cheat her death."

646
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,833
"By cutting off her cursed hand,

647
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,916
she kept her grip upon our land."

648
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:14,666
"She reaches from beyond the grave

649
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,875
to make good men her wicked slaves."

650
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:20,500
Yes, exactly.

651
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:24,166
Don't you see what's happening to us?
This is all proof.

652
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,750
Shadyside isn't just
some hotbed for psychos.

653
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,666
All these massacres are connected
to Sarah Fier.

654
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,250
The witch's curse is real!

655
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:34,541
Fine. Let's assume that the witch
has been possessing people

656
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,875
for some sort of messed-up vendetta.

657
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:40,416
This isn't the same as the mall massacre.
Something different is happening to us.

658
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,750
Something way worse.

659
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:46,125
OK, we have two of her killers after us
and both of them are dead.

660
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,333
Why is she so mad at us?

661
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,416
I saw her.

662
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:53,166
Last night, I don't…

663
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,166
I don't know, you know.
I thought I hit my head…

664
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,291
It was…

665
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:01,875
It was her.

666
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,416
I saw the witch.

667
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:13,916
I can't believe you're wearing that.

668
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,208
Can't believe you're above it,

669
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:17,051
when we're in the middle
of the fucking woods

670
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,791
and dead maniacs are after us.

671
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,666
OK, so I fell out of the car…

672
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,625
here.

673
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,500
I was crawling,

674
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,916
and my nose was bleeding.

675
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:50,958
And then…

676
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,000
I feel something.

677
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:00,833
Chains?

678
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,666
Oh! Not just chains.

679
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,041
- Holy shit.
- Oh my gosh.

680
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:13,291
- No way.
- Oh!

681
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,208
Fier. It's her.

682
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,500
It's her grave.

683
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,750
Oh no, no. No!

684
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:28,541
This is bad! This is really bad!

685
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:31,208
No wonder the witch is pissed at us.
I'd be pissed too.

686
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:32,541
Sam disturbed her grave.

687
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,791
Now she's sending
her henchmen after us.

688
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:38,583
Henchmen?

689
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,000
As in every one of those sickos
on your wall is coming after us?

690
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:45,958
Did you hear that?

691
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,958
Hold up. Hold up.

692
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:54,583
She's mad
because we disturbed her grave, right?

693
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,375
Yeah. So?

694
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,416
So, let's un-disturb it!

695
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,875
Just put the bones back, rebury them,
and put her to rest!

696
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:04,583
No, that's so stupid!

697
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,708
That's genius!

698
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,125
Yeah! In… in <i>Poltergeist!</i>

699
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,125
Whatever.
Let's do it quickly so we can go.

700
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,166
OK.

701
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,833
Deena, Deena!
Find something to wrap her bones!

702
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,625
<i>You! It's you!</i>

703
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,291
<i>It's you!</i>

704
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:52,791
Your nose…

705
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:58,333
Guys?

706
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,375
I think there's someone in the woods!

707
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:13,041
<i>It's you!</i>

708
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,000
<i>It's you!</i>

709
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,791
We need to hurry!

710
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,500
There, there.

711
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:20,916
We're sorry.

712
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:22,583
Did it work?

713
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:26,666
Did it work?

714
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:42,666
- No!
<i>- It's you!</i>

715
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,041
Go, run!

716
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,666
Run! Run!

717
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,000
Go! Come on, go!

718
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,458
Start the car! Go!

719
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,500
- That was the Camp Nightwing Killer!
- That was a bust!

720
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:04,625
Yeah, maybe because
it's not like the movies, OK?

721
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:07,125
It's not as easy as putting bones to rest!

722
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:10,916
- It should've worked. It always works!
- Maybe it's her missing hand.

723
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,666
Who gives a shit? It doesn't matter.
Hey, how do I not die?

724
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,666
We! How do <i>we </i>not die!

725
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,041
And I'm looking at you, witch nerd!

726
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:20,750
- I… I don't know!
- They're not coming for us!

727
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,541
- They're coming for me.
- What?

728
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:28,166
- I saw her again…
<i>- It's you.</i>

729
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:31,666
The witch. She… I disturbed her grave.

730
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,833
- <i>It's you.</i>
- She wants me.

731
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:39,541
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Nightwing ran right by me.

732
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:43,541
I jumped out his way, it was like
he didn't even see me. He went for her.

733
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:47,250
Guys, no! Ruby attacked Simon.

734
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:50,916
Skull Mask came after us at home.
And while you guys were babysitting!

735
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:55,166
No, he didn't.

736
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,250
Skull Mask didn't care about us.

737
00:57:57,333 --> 00:58:00,250
He wanted this. Sam's blood.

738
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:02,541
- What the fu…
- Oh!

739
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:06,041
Yeah! From the crash
when Sam puked period!

740
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,666
It's <i>Jaws</i>, dude!

741
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,083
A shark smelling blood!

742
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:11,833
Kate's right!
When we found Skeletor,

743
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:15,458
he was all sniffy and weird with my shirt
like a perv in a pantie shop!

744
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:17,625
Yeah, but he came to our house too!

745
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,500
Deena…

746
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,958
Sam bled on her bones,
now the witch wants more of her blood!

747
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:29,000
OK, so what do they do in <i>Jaws?</i>

748
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:31,666
They didn't go skinny-dipping
with the goddamn bait.

749
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,750
She's not bait!

750
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:35,041
Yeah. She is.

751
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:38,583
Seriously, if we're right
and they're after her…

752
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,125
let's give these assholes what they want.

753
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:55,541
Alright, we have to decontaminate.

754
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,041
You can't have any of Sam's blood on you.

755
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:00,458
Well, not much I can do about that.

756
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:05,958
Deena, you have to get clean too!
Not a single drop, OK?

757
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,875
Rub-a-dub-dub time!

758
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:09,791
Hey, wait.

759
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,083
I don't want to go in by myself.

760
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:26,125
Up, up, down, down.
Left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

761
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,791
Holy shit, your shoulder.

762
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:37,541
It's fine.

763
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:39,458
OK, well,

764
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,125
fine or not, we s… still need to cover it.

765
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,041
Do you really think
this is going to work?

766
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I do.

767
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:41,458
Josh…

768
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,708
Can you help me?

769
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,166
This is all my fault.

770
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:10,791
I'm sorry.

771
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,208
When I went to Sunnyvale,

772
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,333
I ran away from you.

773
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:19,583
Because you were, like…

774
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,708
this reminder.

775
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,250
I was scared of this.

776
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,208
Of us.

777
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,208
Of me.

778
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,291
And, like, tonight's been the first time

779
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,833
I've felt like myself in…

780
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:40,916
months.

781
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,208
It's been so long.

782
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:47,291
I forgot what that… what that felt like.

783
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,750
You make me feel…

784
01:02:58,916 --> 01:02:59,916
like me.

785
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:25,958
Yeah.

786
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,625
I think you're all good.

787
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:01,125
What if…

788
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,208
What if tonight's it for us?

789
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:46,375
Did you hear that?

790
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:55,708
No!

791
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:56,791
Calm down.

792
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:58,375
It was barely first base.

793
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:03,083
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

794
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:06,583
Did you… all go to pound town?

795
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,041
Me too!

796
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:18,666
Ready?

797
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,000
The trap is simple.

798
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,458
We set the bait.

799
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,916
The killers go to the blood.

800
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,375
Then…

801
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:37,166
Smile, you son of a bitch!

802
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:44,166
Are you sure you want to do this?

803
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,250
See you on the other side.

804
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:55,833
Dude! She's here! I saw her!

805
01:06:55,916 --> 01:07:00,000
She was…
She was so sexy, but fucking crazy still!

806
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,416
She was doing it!
Following the blood trails!

807
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,166
It's working.
Skull Mask freak, three o'clock.

808
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:15,500
Ruby.

809
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:22,458
This is so dumb.

810
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:24,708
If this doesn't work, I will murder you!

811
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:36,500
They're all here.

812
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,083
Go, go, go, go, go!

813
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,958
Come back from that, motherfuckers!

814
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,458
Oh!

815
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:11,583
Guys?

816
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,208
Holy!

817
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:18,708
Run! Run!

818
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:19,791
Go! Go!

819
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:29,416
Help me!

820
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:35,208
- They're coming!
- They're gonna keep coming!

821
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:36,291
We're fucked!

822
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,375
No, no! We are not fucked!

823
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:42,125
She's fucked. They're coming for her.

824
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:44,833
If we put Sam in the hall,
we end this now.

825
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,958
- You're a monster.
- I'm being reasonable!

826
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:48,583
We can't run anymore.

827
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:50,500
A bullet won't stop them, fine.

828
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,958
They're really strong.

829
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:55,750
But we just tried to goddamn explode them,
and that didn't work!

830
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,333
You're suggesting killing her.

831
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:59,791
I mean, that's not exactly
what she's saying.

832
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:01,041
Oh, you're on her side?

833
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:04,208
You'd let us all die to protect her.
Look at this.

834
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,541
OK, all of this.

835
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:07,875
Dead, dead, dead!

836
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:10,125
This is the way.

837
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:12,375
It's the only way.

838
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:18,458
Sam's gotta go.

839
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,208
Are you kidding me?

840
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,666
Kate's right.

841
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:31,625
I don't want you guys to die for me.

842
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:36,083
I'm going.

843
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:39,875
I'm ending this.

844
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:41,208
No, you're not.

845
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:42,750
Are you crazy?

846
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,208
No.

847
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:51,458
No, Sam!

848
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:52,708
Sam!

849
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,000
Sam!

850
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,791
Let me go! Let me… Sam!

851
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,000
Let me go. Let me go!

852
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:19,708
Let me… Help me! Help!

853
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,083
We're letting her die!

854
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:32,000
We're killing her!

855
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,208
Please!

856
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,958
This is not your fault.

857
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:40,166
Please!

858
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,250
Please!

859
01:11:56,958 --> 01:12:01,208
- What… what… what is going on?
- You're not doing this alone.

860
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:03,226
There's another way.

861
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,166
C. Berman.

862
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:06,791
She's the key.

863
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:12,666
Camp Nightwing. Summer of '78.

864
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,083
Group of campers, brutal massacre.

865
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:17,208
There was one Shadyside survivor,
C. Berman.

866
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:21,500
"The still traumatized girl claims that
amidst the carnage she saw the witch."

867
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:25,291
Yeah, just like you.
So, if she survived, I'm pretty sure...

868
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:27,166
There may be a way for me to live too.

869
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:30,416
I got it! C. Berman!
9006 Brennan Way.

870
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,791
This has gotta be her!

871
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,291
Uh, 155-4747!

872
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:41,916
- No one's answering!
<i>- The Berman residence.</i>

873
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,500
<i>- I'm not home right now.</i>
- I need some help here!

874
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:47,375
<i>- Please leave a message after the beep.</i>
- No one's there!

875
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:50,500
Hello, my name is Deena Johnson.
I think you saw the witch.

876
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,375
This shit is not gonna hold!

877
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:56,958
We need to know how you survived!

878
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:59,916
Hey! We're being attacked, alright?
There are killers here!

879
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,541
If you're there, please pick up!
Please answer!

880
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:07,083
<i>- To record a new message, press one.</i>
- Fuck! No!

881
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:09,750
Help!

882
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,666
- Help us!
- Help!

883
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,500
She died.

884
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:23,166
She died.

885
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:26,083
What? No, she's alive.
That's the whole point.

886
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:28,458
Yeah, she… she survived, but…

887
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,458
but first she died.

888
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,263
"C. Berman was found
in the woods."

889
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:38,208
"Her heart had stopped
but local boy performed CPR."

890
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,583
What if this is it?

891
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:44,500
What if that's how she survived?
Her heart stopped.

892
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:46,583
She survived by dying.

893
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:49,666
What is it? The fucking rhyme.
The fucking rhyme!

894
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,916
"She'll take your blood,
she'll take your head!"

895
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,416
- "She'll follow you..."
- "Until you're dead."

896
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,166
It's just like Kate said. OK?

897
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,791
The witch wants you dead.

898
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:01,583
So… we kill you.

899
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:06,541
And then, just like this C. Berman bitch,
we bring you back to life.

900
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:07,708
What are you saying?

901
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:15,416
Fuck it. I'm dying tonight
one way or another.

902
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,916
Let's try to bring me back.

903
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:30,000
Let's do it!

904
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:35,208
Let's Timothy this bitch!

905
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:41,750
A few months ago, my brother Timothy
had an unfortunate experience

906
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:45,375
in which he ingested too much
of a certain substance.

907
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,250
He was dead for two minutes.

908
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,333
But…

909
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:52,125
we got him back!

910
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:54,250
Kate.

911
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,875
It's time for your close-up.

912
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:04,833
You need to take these in order.
Pile one takes the edge off.

913
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:07,958
You're gonna feel like
you're being fucked by a unicorn.

914
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:12,666
Pile two is gonna bring
your core temp <i>way </i>down.

915
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,958
You may feel slightly sick.

916
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:19,458
You need to take a five-minute interval
between pile two and pile three.

917
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,583
That's really important, OK?
Pile three brings you down and out,

918
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:25,166
so take that "take five"
or it's all gonna go to shit!

919
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,541
- How many do we have?
- Tons. Like a thousand.

920
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,833
Wait. EpiPens?

921
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:32,375
Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.

922
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:35,250
This is what brings her back.
This is Jesus!

923
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,375
Sam's blood marks the spot.

924
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,541
Remember half an hour ago,
when you wanted to murder me?

925
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:56,458
You don't have to do this. You can leave.

926
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,625
Remember when you decided
to sacrifice yourself for us?

927
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:01,666
We're ending this together.

928
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,791
Die well, my friend.

929
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:09,375
We got back door patrol.

930
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:12,625
Hey!

931
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,625
I'll run interference up here.

932
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:34,250
OK, I got stock room.
You take the emergency exit.

933
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:37,500
Whoa! No, no, no!
Splitting up is not a good idea at all.

934
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:41,041
But, dude, listen to me.
I know that this is all fucked,

935
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:42,958
but… we gotta do this.

936
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,250
Kate,

937
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,791
she's a crusher.

938
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,333
She doesn't have time for most people.

939
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,500
I know.

940
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:56,333
She's being nice
because we're probably gonna die.

941
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:57,541
No! OK, well…

942
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:00,750
maybe we're gonna die,

943
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:03,291
but Kate is not nice.

944
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:07,000
She sees something in you.

945
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,958
- So?
- So, see that in yourself, dude.

946
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:16,291
We would not be this far
if it weren't for you.

947
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,250
Now we have to keep those psychos
away from Sam.

948
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:22,333
So go…

949
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,250
…man up,

950
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,166
and check that exit.

951
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:33,875
Deena.

952
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:35,708
Deena.

953
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,166
What if we fuck up and just kill me?

954
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:42,750
What if you can't bring me back?

955
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:44,666
Listen to me.

956
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:47,083
When you left,

957
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,333
I saw it all.

958
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:49,708
My whole future,

959
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:52,583
my whole life in Shadyside.

960
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:55,000
A night shift, a day shift,

961
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:57,250
and a million empty beer cans,

962
01:18:57,916 --> 01:18:59,125
just like my dad.

963
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,375
No way out.

964
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:04,416
But tonight, even though we are in hell,

965
01:19:05,416 --> 01:19:08,000
I feel like I have
another chance with you.

966
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:10,583
And I'm not gonna lose you again.

967
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:13,500
Because you, and we,

968
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:15,083
are the way out.

969
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:20,541
When this is all over,
I am gonna take you on a date.

970
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:26,666
We're going to eat cheeseburgers
and listen to the Pixies,

971
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:32,208
and make out and have
the best night of our goddamn lives.

972
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:36,125
But right now, you've got to die.

973
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:39,458
Now, look at me. Look at me.

974
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:42,708
I am going to bring you back.

975
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:34,583
Swallow it. Swallow it.

976
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:36,500
Swallow it. Swallow it.

977
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:13,916
Oh, come on!

978
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,375
Come on!

979
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:26,750
I'm so sorry.

980
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:30,291
- It's OK. It's OK.
- I'm so sorry.

981
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:35,083
- Look.
- Huh?

982
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:38,666
Look. Behind… behind you!

983
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,833
Go! Go! Go!

984
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:44,583
Go!

985
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:45,958
Oh!

986
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:54,208
I need to die. I need to die.

987
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:56,541
I'm gonna figure this out!

988
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,041
Go, go!

989
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:48,000
No! No!

990
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:49,583
No!

991
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:52,791
No!

992
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,791
No!

993
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:56,041
Finish it.

994
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:58,875
No! No!

995
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:49,375
Do it! Do it! Do it! Come on!

996
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:07,375
No! No! No!

997
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:19,250
No! No!

998
01:25:20,708 --> 01:25:22,875
No! No!

999
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,375
Go! She's right behind me!

1000
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:56,541
Come on, Sam!

1001
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:18,000
Come on, Sam!

1002
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:36,375
No! No!

1003
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:52,166
Sam?

1004
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:07,166
Josh, Josh! Come help me! Get the pens!

1005
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,666
Get the pens!

1006
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,666
Help me! Go get the EpiPens!

1007
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:12,416
Come!

1008
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:16,916
Come, hurry!

1009
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:23,833
Sam!

1010
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:27,791
Here, here, here!

1011
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,000
Are you doing it right?

1012
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:38,166
I don't know. I don't know.

1013
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:43,583
I don't think it's working.

1014
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:46,000
It has to work! It has to.

1015
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,000
It has to. Sam?

1016
01:27:49,083 --> 01:27:51,416
Sam?

1017
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:58,041
Everyone's dead.

1018
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,666
Simon…

1019
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:04,000
Kate…

1020
01:28:04,625 --> 01:28:06,541
No. No, Sam!

1021
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:09,791
I will not let you do this.

1022
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:13,375
Come on!

1023
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,125
Come on.

1024
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:19,416
Come on, Sam.

1025
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,666
One, two, three.

1026
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:24,541
Come on, Sam.
Come on. Come on, Sam!

1027
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:26,833
One, two, three, four.

1028
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:30,458
One, two, three, four.

1029
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:52,958
It's over.

1030
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:56,875
It's over.

1031
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:00,583
It's OK.

1032
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:03,583
It's over. It's over.

1033
01:29:11,875 --> 01:29:14,791
Interview with Deena Johnson.

1034
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:18,083
Sunday, October 2nd, 1994.

1035
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:19,583
Wanna tell me what happened?

1036
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:23,083
We were picking up Sam's prescription.

1037
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:26,541
And the lights went out.
It was pitch black.

1038
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:29,125
I couldn't really see anything.

1039
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,500
We ducked behind a counter.

1040
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:32,041
We hid until it was over.

1041
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:34,250
How'd you get that?

1042
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,083
I fell on some glass.

1043
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:40,708
Fell on some glass.

1044
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:43,541
You had 15 stitches
in your shoulder.

1045
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:45,125
I fell on some glass.

1046
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:51,333
Sam, you look like a ghost.
Like you just came back from the dead.

1047
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:54,333
Shock, I guess.

1048
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:59,958
I'll tell you what the facts tell me.

1049
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:02,416
- The junkies...
- Kate and Simon?

1050
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,833
They weren't junkies.

1051
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:06,500
They were my friends.

1052
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:11,000
They're to blame for everything.
That feels too easy to me.

1053
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:13,875
But that's the story
this department will go with

1054
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:16,583
unless you can help me
to see it differently.

1055
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,125
Another Shadyside tragedy.

1056
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:24,500
An underprivileged overachiever
with bright prospects.

1057
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:31,666
A guy who's been supporting
his family alone since he was 15.

1058
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:37,208
Both succumbing
to the quick cash of drugs.

1059
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,125
Fits the narrative, right?

1060
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:44,208
Nice and neat.

1061
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:51,250
You came here for my help.

1062
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:53,500
I should have listened to you. I'm sorry.

1063
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:56,208
I'm listening now.

1064
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:58,791
But there's nothing else to say.

1065
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,833
Do you want your friends
going down for this?

1066
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:04,958
No.

1067
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:07,416
But they're dead.

1068
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:13,583
Hey.

1069
01:31:13,625 --> 01:31:15,791
Urkel. Help me out?

1070
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:18,291
Oh, OK.

1071
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:20,291
So I'm a bad guy because I'm in here.

1072
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:23,458
Then that makes you a bad guy, too,
little man.

1073
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:44,083
Let's go.

1074
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:51,875
I owe you.

1075
01:31:54,916 --> 01:31:57,500
Anything comes to you, call me.

1076
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:08,541
Prodigal son returns.

1077
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,208
Man, you ain't my family.

1078
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:16,208
Sam!

1079
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:18,541
Samantha!

1080
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:23,333
So I guess I'll…

1081
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:26,000
see you tomorrow?

1082
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,500
No.

1083
01:32:38,416 --> 01:32:39,416
See you tonight.

1084
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:52,708
Come on!

1085
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:03,803
<i>More death in Shadyside.</i>

1086
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:07,416
<i>A drug-fueled night of violence
leaves a trail of bodies.</i>

1087
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,958
<i>Melissa, give us a recap.</i>

1088
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:11,583
<i>There are</i>
<i>three dead at East Union Medical…</i>

1089
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:14,666
I, uh… I wanted…

1090
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,166
I wanted to give you this the other day.

1091
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,500
- But, uh...
- What is this?

1092
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:20,750
Um…

1093
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:23,333
- A mixtape?
- Yeah.

1094
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:25,916
But you don't have to open it right now.

1095
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,208
I knew it.

1096
01:34:16,791 --> 01:34:18,791
Josh, someone's at the door!

1097
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:20,416
Josh!

1098
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:23,000
What?

1099
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:30,125
You ordered dinner?

1100
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:33,250
Yeah, it's not a big deal.
Just some pizza.

1101
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:38,041
Ah! Stop! Don't be weird!

1102
01:34:48,166 --> 01:34:49,166
Hello?

1103
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:54,375
Hello?

1104
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:57,958
Alright. Listen, asshole.
Don't call here...

1105
01:34:58,041 --> 01:34:59,291
<i>You're still alive!</i>

1106
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:02,375
Who is this?

1107
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:05,583
- <i>Sam…</i>
<i>- You called me.</i>

1108
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:08,708
<i>Wanted to know how I survived
the Camp Nightwing Massacre.</i>

1109
01:35:09,666 --> 01:35:11,041
C. Berman.

1110
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:14,541
<i>Did you touch the bones?</i>
<i>Did you see her face?</i>

1111
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:16,666
- No. It's over.
<i>- Over?</i>

1112
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:20,583
Yeah, but, uh…
thanks for your prompt reply.

1113
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:22,726
- <i>It's not over.</i>
<i>- Sam…</i>

1114
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,416
<i>It's never over.</i>

1115
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:26,208
We ended it.

1116
01:35:27,041 --> 01:35:28,583
We stopped the killers.

1117
01:35:28,666 --> 01:35:30,416
<i>But you haven't stopped her.</i>

1118
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,083
<i>You can't.</i>

1119
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:34,666
<i>She makes the rules.</i>

1120
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:37,958
Who?

1121
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:40,041
<i>The witch.</i>

1122
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:45,291
<i>She'll do whatever it takes.</i>

1123
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,916
<i>You're not safe.</i>

1124
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:55,500
<i>She'll find a way.</i>

1125
01:36:03,666 --> 01:36:05,083
<i>She'll come for you.</i>

1126
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:11,083
Sam.

1127
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:36,375
Stop it! Get off!

1128
01:37:37,291 --> 01:37:38,625
Sam! Sam!

1129
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:40,541
Stop! Stop!

1130
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,458
Sam!

1131
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:45,875
Don't! It's me!

1132
01:37:48,666 --> 01:37:49,833
It's me! It's me!

1133
01:38:26,666 --> 01:38:27,708
What the…

1134
01:38:30,708 --> 01:38:33,000
Sam's not feeling like herself.

1135
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:40,625
We have to get her back.

1136
01:38:45,583 --> 01:38:47,208
I'm going to get you back.

1137
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:04,708
The witch…

1138
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:06,666
The town curse…

1139
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:09,458
I thought there was a way to end it.

1140
01:39:09,541 --> 01:39:11,416
But now I know

1141
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,125
there is no end.

1142
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:16,500
This is July 12th.

1143
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,208
Summer of 1978.

1144
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:21,750
The first day of camp.

1145
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,750
A week later…

1146
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,458
my sister was dead.

1146
01:39:28,305 --> 01:40:28,392
