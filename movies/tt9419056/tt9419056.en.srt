Are you saying that Banfield
could become such a shrine?

331
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:01,335
Well, first
we have to, uh, confirm

332
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:04,138
that an actual miracle
has truly occurred.

333

And that is why
Monsignor Delgarde here

these, uh, alleged healings.

337
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:18,652
In the 18th century,
Pope Benedict XIV

338
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:20,621
laid out a procedure
to determine

339
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:23,357
the veracity of a miracle.

340
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:25,760
The main steps are:

341
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:28,863
the illness must be incurable,

342
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:31,766
the cure must be instantaneous,

343
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:34,335
the cure must be complete.

344
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,170
In my capacity as inquisitor,

345
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:39,740
I intend to use all medical
science and technology available

346
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:43,344
to disprove the alleged miracle

and expose any deceit.

348
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:51,185
If I fail, the miracle
is to be considered genuine.

349
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,157
Meanwhile,
the church has installed
