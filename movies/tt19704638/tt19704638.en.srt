<i>I wanna call it a nightmare.</i>

3
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,987
<i>It was</i>

4
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>absolutely wrong from the beginning.</i>

5
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:34,260
<i>I personally think
it was an experiment for him,</i>

6
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,138
<i>some sick game.</i>

7
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,731
<i>I think
about the "why" every single day.</i>

8
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,395
<i>Hi, Jacoba, this is Dr. Webber calling.</i>

9
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,105
<i>I have your lab results in.</i>

10
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,828
<i>So give me a call when you have a chance,
and we can go over those.</i>

11
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,299
<i>Thank you. Bye.</i>

12
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,742
<i>Hi, this message is for Jacoba Ballard.
This is Jane over at Dr. Chan's office.</i>

13
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,386
<i>Give us a callback. We want
to reschedule you for an appointment.</i>

14
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,412
<i>Thanks so much.</i>

15
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,229
Growing up, I felt different.

16
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,275
I'm this blonde-haired, blue-eyed person

17
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,444
in a family with dark hair

18
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,738
and, like, olive skin and dark eyes.

19
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,408
So, I kept asking my mom

20
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,286
if I was adopted.

21
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,125
I kept, like, reassuring my parents,

22
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,046
and I'm like, "It's fine if I am,
you can tell me. It'll be okay."

23
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,677
Finally, my mom told me the truth.

24
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,850
So, I've known since the age of ten

25
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,395
that I was from donor sperm.

26
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,695
I believe it was 1979,

27
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,492
and... I wanted a child so bad,

28
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,080
but my husband could not have children.

29
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,540
So I went to see Dr. Cline

30
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,335
for artificial insemination.

31
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,590
I was young.

32
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,593
I think, like, 20, 21.

33
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,721
He was professional.

34
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,724
Uh, we didn't really say a lot.

35
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,270
I mean, he just told us
that he would match us with a donor

36
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,230
that looked like my husband.

37
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,566
He was gonna use medical students,

38
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,776
their sperm.

39
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,612
And so, when I start ovulating,

40
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,573
I went in, they did the procedure...

41
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,288
and, um, I went home, and I was pregnant.

42
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,087
She's my everything.

43
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,845
I love that child more than life itself.

44
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,282
I always had
this longing for siblings.

45
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,286
I just wanted somebody that related to me,

46
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,205
that's, you know, my brother or sister,

47
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,124
and I just wanted to have that bond.

48
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,629
When I was around the age of 18,

49
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,798
you know, around, like, 1999,

50
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,135
there wasn't commercial DNA testing.

51
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:49,640
All I knew
was my mom went to Dr. Donald Cline,

52
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,644
and he was the go-to doctor.

53
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,440
My mom was told that

54
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,735
they used a medical resident
for donor sperm,

55
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,739
and they never used
the medical resident or the donor,

56
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,449
say, more than three times.

57
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,201
So, since there was me,

58
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,496
I figured that I might have
one or two half-siblings.

59
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,334
So, I looked him up,
and I called him at his office.

60
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,628
He actually answered the phone.

61
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,924
I wanted to know if he had a donor number

62
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,218
or my mom's medical records

63
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,805
to where I could have
some kind of identifying information.

64
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,307
He was very

65
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,018
straightforward, matter-of-fact,

66
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,479
um, no empathy.

67
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,815
But I remember asking him,

68
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,317
like, telling him
I wanted to find half-siblings,

69
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,153
and he said that
I can't ever know that information.

70
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,280
My mother's records have been destroyed.

71
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,411
He wished me good luck,
and that was it.

72
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,748
I just went on with life and, you know,

73
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,961
married, raised my children,
and hoped that someday maybe

74
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,171
I would find a sibling or two.

75
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,853
Watching our friends' children
growing up around us

76
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,148
left us feeling isolated and desperate.

77
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,734
But as we found out, we were not alone.

78
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,488
One out of five couples
living in the United States

79
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,824
experience infertility problems.

80
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,119
<i>The physicians and staff
at Indianapolis Infertility</i>

81
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:37,165
<i>can help you understand your particular
infertility problem more clearly.</i>

82
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,709
<i>Both Dr. Donald Cline
and Dr. Robert Colver</i>

83
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,003
<i>are specialists
in the field of infertility</i>

84
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,713
<i>and have achieved excellent results</i>

85
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,883
<i>in diagnosing and treating
thousands of infertile couples.</i>

86
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:53,681
Dr. Cline was the best-known
infertility doctor in Indianapolis.

87
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,642
And I started working for him

88
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,980
in '81 to '94.

89
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,899
I worked 13 years.

90
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,154
I was partnered with Dr. Cline
from 1987 to 1991, and I have to say,

91
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,866
my career wouldn't be
what it has been over the last 35 years

92
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,035
if it hadn't been for Don Cline. So...

93
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:18,581
You know, I have a very special place
in my heart for that man.

94
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,002
Before '85, for an insemination

95
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,795
or for a donor insemination,

96
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,464
fresh sperm was used.

97
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,593
And back then,
you didn't have, like today,

98
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,888
you go on a website, 300 guys show up.

99
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,057
We had a notebook

100
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,852
so they could pick
from what donor criteria they wanted.

101
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,690
The hospital was...
It's just right across the street.

102
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,779
And I actually went to the hospital
and met some of the donors

103
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,073
because they were residents,
and I knew 'em.

104
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,492
And they would pass me the specimen,

105
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,677
and I would take it back to the office.

106
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,331
It has to be kept warm, body temperature.

107
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,043
And so I transported the sample in my bra,

108
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:08,214
so the sperm was still viable
by the time I got it over at the office.

109
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,469
It was a great field.
It was really interesting.

110
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,932
We were putting tubes back together
so people... women could get pregnant.

111
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,310
And he had
a terrific success rate at that.

112
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,063
We'd do laser surgery on tubes,

113
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,525
and that was a new thing
that Don did that other doctors didn't do.

114
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,862
For these couples, you have to have them

115
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,907
really think through this,
talk through this, pray about it.

116
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,411
Really feel like you thought through
this whole thing, because

117
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,413
once you do that donor insemination

118
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,416
and they get pregnant,
that's their baby. Forever.

119
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,299
It was always very emotional

120
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,594
when one of your girlfriends
would call you and say she was pregnant

121
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,972
because there were several times
that I'd get off the phone,

122
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,475
and I'd just cry
because I wanted a child so bad.

123
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,481
My husband and I had gone
to various fertility doctors

124
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,818
trying to find... <i>my </i>issue.

125
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,364
It was hard on me and my husband.

126
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:21,287
But I thought, "Okay. I've finally found
a doctor that might be able to help us

127
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,123
because he was so well-known."

128
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,252
I was about 27.

129
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,590
I, uh... My husband and I
talked about having our own children.

130
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,678
My husband got tested,
and he was infertile.

131
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:44,185
I was told, "The only person
who's doing live sperm donor insemination

132
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,978
is Dr. Don Cline."

133
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,773
"He's the best of the best, so go to him."

134
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,987
By that point,
it'd been two and a half years

135
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,991
of having my period
when I wanted to really conceive,

136
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,829
taking my temperature, and...
for every month and every day.

137
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:09,335
So it was the first time I felt...
It was hopeful.

138
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:17,093
I carried my husband's sperm
in a little container.

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,638
Well, we didn't have much time
because you had to have it there,

140
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,847
I think, within an hour.

141
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,102
And then there was this room

142
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,689
that I would go into
for the artificial insemination,

143
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,732
right then with the sperm,

144
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,152
with some kind of long, like, um...

145
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:40,491
Well, it looked like a needle-type thing,
but that was all I remember.

146
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,121
He'd walk me back to the exam room,

147
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,916
I'm lying down,
and my knees are up in the air.

148
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:54,797
He said, "Okay. I'm gonna, uh,
put this... this specimen in you."

149
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,678
So I wait on the table
for about 20 minutes.

150
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,473
I was thinking actually positive thoughts.

151
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,599
I was thinking,

152
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,603
"Wow. I might be able to have a child."

153
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,113
When the doctor's office called me

154
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,116
and told me I was pregnant,

155
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,951
I... I couldn't believe it.

156
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,457
We were just so happy
when I had her.

157
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:36,005
I even took Julie back into the office
and then showed her off to Dr. Cline.

158
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,052
I thought I had altitude sickness.

159
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,098
So I laid off a little bit of skiing,

160
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,684
and ate more crackers, and drank some tea,

161
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,937
and, um, never thinking I was pregnant.

162
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,775
I thought I was just late.

163
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,655
I was ecstatic.

164
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,119
I thought it was a gift at the time.

165
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:19,548
In 2014, you see 23andMe

166
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,551
on, like, every other commercial on TV.

167
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,055
I was 35,

168
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,600
and I told my husband
I was gonna take a DNA test

169
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,229
because I figured,
at least, I had one or two siblings.

170
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,818
I felt like it was kind of a bonus
if I did find the donor,

171
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,362
but that wasn't, like, my goal.

172
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,280
My goal was to find a sibling.

173
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,328
The fall of 2014,

174
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,540
I received my results.

175
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,505
I remember that day vividly.

176
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,803
It came back that I was related to

177
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,847
seven siblings.

178
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,435
It was actually immediate excitement, um,

179
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,646
with concern.

180
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,942
Finding out
that I had siblings was amazing,

181
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,611
but there's, you know, eight of us.

182
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,488
What... what's going on here?

183
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,574
Because my mom was told

184
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,119
that they never used a donor
more than three times.

185
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,999
Three times was the ideal.

186
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,003
We didn't want a large population

187
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,005
with all the same father.

188
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,008
There's the concern for consanguinity,

189
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:49,471
uh, having too many people
in a certain geographic area

190
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,058
that could potentially be your brother
or your sister, and you didn't know it.

191
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:58,939
Because you could potentially
have a brother and sister marrying.

192
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,652
Hold up.

193
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,279
This doesn't make sense.

194
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,867
Obviously, you used someone's sperm
more than three times.

195
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:17,541
And that's when we started
to do our own investigating.

196
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,129
Every weekend, we would call each other,

197
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:27,051
or we would plug names into Ancestry
and work on a family tree.

198
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,180
We joked one day, trying to figure it out,

199
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,558
and we're like, "Wouldn't it be crazy
if it was the doctor?"

200
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,455
But we disregarded it, and we're like,

201
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,481
"Probably not, but we'll go through
this journey together."

202
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,734
"We'll help each other find
who our biological father is."

203
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,908
We were able to just focus
on our paternal matches,

204
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,578
and we all matched a lady named Sylvia,

205
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,414
who was our second cousin,

206
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,918
and she was on 23andMe.

207
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,921
So, we had messaged her.

208
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:09,677
I asked her what surnames
was in her family tree,

209
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,430
and she gave us a whole list of names.

210
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,483
One of the names
that popped up was Swinford.

211
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,606
Swinford is
Donald Cline's mother's maiden name.

212
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,442
I said, "By any chance,

213
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:29,071
do you have
the name Cline in your family?"

214
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,368
She said, "Oh yes,
I completely forgot. My cousin Don."

215
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,370
"He's a doctor."

216
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,041
Right then, my stomach dropped,

217
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:45,587
and I felt sick because she just confirmed

218
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:50,467
what I think we probably already knew,
but we were hoping wasn't true.

219
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,387
Dr. Donald Cline

220
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,390
could be our biological father.

221
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,354
I was in shock.

222
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,568
There were so many emotions.

223
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,820
So many questions.

224
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,283
He lied about a donor being used.

225
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,244
Why did he do it?

226
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,164
And how long did he do it?

227
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,293
And how many siblings do we have?

228
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,713
I honestly didn't know who to go to.

229
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:32,176
I googled, like, "Where do you make
a complaint against a doctor?"

230
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,264
That, in turn,
led to me filing a complaint

231
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,559
with the Attorney General's office
for Indiana.

232
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,190
So, then I received a form back
from the Attorney General's office

233
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,276
that was like,
their generic messaging like,

234
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,822
"Hi. We've received your complaint,
and it's gonna be investigated further,

235
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,783
and someone will be in touch."

236
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,872
We waited and waited.
Nobody was returning my calls.

237
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,917
No questioning, nothing
from the Attorney General's office.

238
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,213
I wanted answers.

239
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,716
So I reached out
to every news outlet, big and small,

240
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,803
and nobody would pick up the story.

241
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,262
...and I'm Angela Ganote.

242
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,556
Yeah. We're starting off
on a chilly start today,

243
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,725
but it's gonna warm up and warm up fast.

244
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,602
I was watching TV one day,

245
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,021
- and I was like...
- ..."Her!"

246
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,482
"I forgot to send it to her."

247
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,319
In February of 2015,
I logged onto Facebook,

248
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,613
and I had a message from Jacoba.

249
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,616
The message was in-depth,

250
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,160
saying that she believed
a doctor in Indianapolis

251
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,956
had inseminated multiple women
with his own sperm.

252
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,794
It was shocking,
but it was also backed by proof.

253
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,588
Before Jacoba came to me,

254
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,591
she had reached out
to Attorney General of our state,

255
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,136
the Attorney General of the United States.

256
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,972
She had reached out
to national news organizations,

257
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,890
and she had gotten no response.

258
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,269
And I thought,
"Why is no one listening, or at least

259
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,229
finding the truth?"

260
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,523
I walked into our news director's office,

261
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,900
and I said,
"You guys are not gonna believe this."

262
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,532
I reached out to Dr. Cline
in the very beginning.

263
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,118
He told me that he was not the father.

264
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,873
He told me that he only used sperm
from a doctor in training,

265
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,791
that there is no way possible

266
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,878
that the siblings had more
than three brothers or sisters.

267
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,922
I asked if he would like
to see the DNA evidence.

268
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,009
I asked him if he would like
to provide his own DNA

269
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,636
so that he could help them.

270
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,682
"If you're not the father,
have a DNA test and prove to them."

271
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,142
And he wouldn't.

272
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,439
So when we
first aired the first story,

273
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:54,651
I couldn't use his name,
and that was, um, hard for me.

274
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,448
Sisters, born here in Indiana,
uncover a family secret.

275
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,075
Their dad is not their biological father.

276
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,577
They are donor children,

277
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,164
the product of an anonymous man
who donated his sperm.

278
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,835
Since we didn't have
Donald Cline's DNA,

279
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,921
we couldn't really move forward

280
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,758
until we had him take a DNA test

281
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,845
to prove that
he was our biological father.

282
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,892
Like, we knew it in our gut,
but we didn't have anybody at the state

283
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,685
that would get back with us, and

284
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,232
they weren't in any hurry
to get a DNA sample from him.

285
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:40,197
So, one of my half-siblings

286
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,116
messaged all
of Cline's children and grandchildren

287
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,369
that were over the age of 18.

288
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,745
Basically said,

289
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,374
"Our mothers went through
infertility treatment."

290
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,671
"Did somebody
in your family donate sperm?"

291
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,472
It was probably
a week or two later,

292
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,559
Cline's son messaged me.

293
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,022
So, I met with Doug and Donna,

294
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,776
which are two of Cline's children,
with his wife, Audrey.

295
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,864
I chose to do it at my church

296
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,200
because I felt more comfortable.

297
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,245
I don't know these people,

298
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,915
and these are some big accusations.

299
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,252
They said they had talked to their dad,

300
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:41,842
and he did admit
that he was our biological father.

301
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:49,057
But Doug said that the only time
that Cline used his sperm

302
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,435
was when he didn't have access to a donor,

303
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,022
and as far as siblings go,

304
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,358
there was absolutely no more than ten.

305
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,252
I had seen
the news pop on one night...

306
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,298
<i>...they are donor children
searching for answers...</i>

307
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,634
...and I saw Jacoba on TV,

308
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:29,389
and my husband thought
that we looked a lot alike.

309
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,059
My husband's exact words were,

310
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,269
"I don't feel like
this is going to end well,

311
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,188
and I want you to be aware of that."

312
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,484
So I talked to my mom.

313
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,862
My daughter called me and said,

314
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,282
"Should I get tested?" And I said, "No."

315
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,284
'Cause I, at that point in time,

316
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,870
I thought it was
my husband's sperm that he had used.

317
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,997
She said,

318
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,416
"You know, honey.
This doesn't apply to you."

319
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,961
"This doesn't pertain to you at all.
I know you're your dad and I's."

320
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,507
Um, but something in my gut,
I just couldn't let it go.

321
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,637
So I notified Jacoba via Facebook.

322
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,599
She wasn't really sure
if this would pertain to me at all,

323
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:16,728
'cause I was supposed to have been
from my father and not a donor.

324
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,523
So she said the best way
to do it is just take a test.

325
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,649
And once I took that test,

326
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,110
if we were related,
her name would show up.

327
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,956
Hardest thing I've ever had to go through.

328
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,172
Go back to everything
that you've known about yourself.

329
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,095
It just completely
washes away your identity.

330
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,350
And you really have no idea
who you are anymore.

331
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,855
We both cried on the phone,

332
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,817
and then I had to...

333
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,071
...figure out a way
I was gonna tell my husband

334
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,783
'cause I knew
that it was gonna devastate him.

335
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,412
I said, "Remember
when we went to Dr. Cline?"

336
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:19,583
And I said, "Unfortunately, um,

337
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,503
Dr. Cline didn't use <i>your</i> sperm.
He used his own."

338
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,212
"So...

339
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,135
we're just now finding out
that Julie is not yours."

340
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,929
My husband started crying.

341
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:38,310
And he said that,
and I'll never forget these words.

342
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,855
He says,
"He's taken everything away from me."

343
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,608
And he did.

344
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,943
It's hard.

345
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,905
I mean, what did he do
with my dad's sperm?

346
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,115
He just threw it away like it was nothing?

347
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,328
I mean, it's just... It's wrong.

348
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,049
After I met with Doug,

349
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,844
he had called me and said,

350
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,306
"I will do whatever it takes
to get you the answers."

351
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,476
And I said, "We want to meet him."

352
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,520
"We have questions for him."

353
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,357
"I want him to look us in the eye."

354
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,026
"You at least owe us that much."

355
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,534
And so he set up a time
for myself and five other siblings

356
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,118
to be able to meet Cline.

357
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,046
It was almost like
the moment that his feet hit the floor,

358
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,924
you could hear his footsteps,

359
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,717
and you could hear his cane.

360
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,514
He was not showing emotion.

361
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,644
And on his hip,
I could see the outline of a gun.

362
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,525
I think that it was
partially to intimidate us.

363
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,488
So he introduced himself,

364
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:18,493
and he went around the table,
asking each one's name, age,

365
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,204
and what they did for a profession.

366
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,837
It was almost like he was ranking us.

367
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,505
Like, "Let me see

368
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,634
which one of my offspring
made it to the top."

369
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,470
I felt like we were being judged.

370
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,684
Then we asked about medical history

371
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:47,022
because some of us,
we have autoimmune disorders and stuff.

372
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,568
He said that there was nothing
that we needed to worry about.

373
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,031
He had a piece of paper with him

374
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,783
that he brought scripture on.

375
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,535
Jeremiah 1:5.

376
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,123
I remember him looking at me
and going, "Jacoba, this is for you."

377
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,667
Because he knew
I was having a hard time with this,

378
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,086
and I'm like, "Put that shit away."

379
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,591
I said... I did, I said,
"Just put that shit away."

380
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:18,136
"You're not gonna use my God
to justify your actions."

381
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,975
One of my siblings did ask him
why he used his own sperm.

382
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,479
And he said that he only did it

383
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,481
because he felt like the mothers

384
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,068
were just basically desperate for a child,

385
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,320
and he was doing it to help them.

386
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,784
Finally, he said that the absolute number,

387
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,578
there would not be more than 15 siblings.

388
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,463
It's just too fucked up.

389
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,263
I... I just felt bad for my mother.

390
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,307
I mean...

391
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,520
here she was, you know,

392
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,648
a young woman
just wanting to have a family

393
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,024
like anyone else.

394
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,909
It's a sick individual
that puts themselves in that position

395
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,202
to be able to do that.

396
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:32,001
There are parts of me that wish
that I never had to deal with infertility.

397
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,094
I wish that walk on no one.

398
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,643
The way it worked
for me with Cline is, uh,

399
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,895
I would go to his office.

400
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,859
He was always
the only one in the office,

401
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,445
whether I was coming in
on a weekend or during the week,

402
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,072
during the midday, or late evening.

403
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,951
He was the only one that greeted me
in his office, which was strange.

404
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,458
And now the truth is that,

405
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,460
as Cline was closing the door

406
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,004
and I'm undressing
and putting my feet in the stirrups

407
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,466
getting ready for him
to bring in the donor's sperm,

408
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:24,804
he was in the... some other place
in the office ejaculating,

409
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,558
and not only creating the erection,
but he has to go in full force

410
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,394
in a sexual manner
to create that ejaculation.

411
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,691
To me, that has always remained
a very sad part to me,

412
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,193
and disgusting.

413
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,530
That he was placing then his semen

414
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,241
into some kind of syringe,

415
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:50,997
and then he's got to place that syringe
at the base of my cervix.

416
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,793
The fact that he

417
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,463
was still in an endocrine high

418
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,548
from having the ejaculation

419
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,803
has no place in a medical setting.

420
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,684
When Matt's DNA test came back...

421
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,817
my first words were,

422
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,278
"I was raped 15 times
and didn't even know it."

423
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,661
This is unbelievable.

424
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,996
How the fuck did no one know?

425
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,959
I mean, just even the act of what he did

426
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,545
for so many years,

427
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,339
and to just get away with it

428
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,844
for decades, and no one knew anything.

429
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,137
No one in the office?

430
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,763
Come on.

431
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,267
Well, here's the thing.

432
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,103
There wasn't much traffic
on that first floor

433
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,438
other than
we'd come directly into our office.

434
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,942
Don could have
clearly collected a specimen,

435
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,028
and then he got it back,
and no one would know.

436
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,823
They could... The nurse
could be in there for the insemination.

437
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,201
They wouldn't know if it was
a donor from the hospital or not.

438
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,790
Dr. Colver and I have discussed it,
and we had no idea.

439
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,419
It just was never a thought,

440
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,005
because it was so totally opposite

441
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,300
from his normal behavior.

442
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,018
This was a person
of a position of power.

443
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,770
He's known in our community
as a philanthropist.

444
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,398
He's known in our community
as an elder of the church.

445
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,902
He was always a doctor.

446
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,363
He was not gonna sit there
and chat with you.

447
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,991
It was all pretty much

448
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,786
doctor-person relationship.

449
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,749
Or a stern father figure,

450
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,960
if, you know,
if you can relate better to that.

451
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:06,090
Mark was stationed
at Grissom Air Force Base,

452
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,675
and so was Don,

453
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,596
and we were socially friendly.

454
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,183
I would say arrogant fits him,
for some reason.

455
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,937
I mean, I don't know
exactly why I felt that way.

456
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,107
You... you do because you were
in study groups and so on.

457
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,904
Uh, he was... he was okay.
I mean, he obviously was a bright guy.

458
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,989
He thought he knew... He did know a lot.

459
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,658
He always was confident.

460
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,618
He always was self-assured.

461
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,579
He wasn't... I never saw him doubt

462
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,874
that what he was doing wasn't right.

463
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,713
If you knew something,
and he knew something, he knew more.

464
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,383
That was his attitude.

465
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:54,764
He always belittled
how much I knew about child de...

466
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,141
You know, child development, even.

467
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,395
I mean, that was my area of specialty.

468
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:05,274
Uh, I... I have a PhD in neurobiology,

469
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,653
and I'm also, um,
an occupational therapist,

470
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,030
and I treated preemies.

471
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,408
But he knew more.

472
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,662
If you crossed him...

473
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,497
...that was it.

474
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,217
The first conversations
that I had with Dr. Cline,

475
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,761
he told me
that he was protected under HIPAA.

476
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,224
He told me that I could be sued
or that Fox 59 could be sued.

477
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,062
He made it very clear
that I needed to be careful.

478
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,524
So, that's when Cline called me.

479
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,901
I was in shock.

480
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,862
I don't know what it was in me.

481
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,615
He called my home phone,
and I recorded that conversation.

482
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,868
- <i>Jacoba?</i>
- Yes.

483
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,620
<i>Uh, this is Dr. Cline.</i>

484
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:03,332
<i>Uh, do you have time
to talk with me just a little bit?</i>

485
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,293
- Yes.
<i>- Okay.</i>

486
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:10,923
<i>Um, I'm getting, uh,
a real problem with, um,</i>

487
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:15,803
<i>uh, the television station, um, 59.</i>

488
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,929
Mm-hmm.

489
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:22,351
<i>Um, they are demanding,
um, that I meet with them.</i>

490
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,438
<i>Uh, I can't do that.</i>

491
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,025
<i>Uh, it's not fair to me.
It's not fair to you all.</i>

492
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,737
<i>Uh, they're... they're trying to make a, um...</i>

493
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,324
<i>Oh...</i>

494
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,619
<i>They're... they're trying to, um...</i>

495
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,581
<i>improve their ratings,</i>

496
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:50,880
<i>and, um, my wife and I,
after 57 years of marriage...</i>

497
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:54,175
<i>Um, if... if this comes out,</i>

498
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,845
<i>uh, our marriage will be over.</i>

499
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,638
<i>Um,</i>

500
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,474
<i>can you help?</i>

501
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:05,645
<i>I mean, no disrespect,</i>

502
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,899
<i>but I feel like what you're telling me
is to keep my life a secret.</i>

503
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:15,029
<i>That I am not allowed to know who I am...</i>

504
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,533
<i>- Well...
- ...when I didn't do anything wrong.</i>

505
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,161
<i>Well, yes, but you know, I didn't...</i>

506
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,540
<i>At the time, I didn't feel like
I was doing anything wrong either.</i>

507
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,043
<i>But you... I feel like I'm
being blamed for this, like it's my fault.</i>

508
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,586
<i>I don't understand.</i>

509
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:36,300
<i>It's, uh, it's your fault
because I don't care who you tell.</i>

510
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,426
<i>It's just</i>

511
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:43,182
<i>putting it on television
for the entire world to see.</i>

512
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,938
<i>Well, I... I cannot...
Like I said, I can't control her.</i>

513
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,440
<i>I can't stop that. I can't.</i>

514
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,945
<i>Well, because you... you...
you can stop talking to her and say,</i>

515
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,781
<i>"You know,
I... I just don't want to share anymore."</i>

516
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,243
<i>I'm just telling you what's gonna happen,</i>

517
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,871
<i>and I'm going to be hurt badly.</i>

518
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,749
<i>Well, that's
what's happened to everybody so far,</i>

519
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,171
<i>and you know,
that... that's because of the actions...</i>

520
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,923
<i>This tells me that
that's exactly what you want.</i>

521
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,476
When you push me,
I'm gonna push back 100 times more.

522
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,812
So when he called me, it's like,

523
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,647
"Bring it on."

524
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,611
"Bring it on
because I'm ready to fight you."

525
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,822
<i>♪ When I go, don't cry for me ♪</i>

526
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,533
<i>♪ In my Father's arms, I'll be ♪</i>

527
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,370
I contacted
the Attorney General's office again

528
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,540
to get a status on this complaint,

529
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,293
and nobody was returning my calls.

530
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,504
<i>♪ Sun and moon will be replaced ♪</i>

531
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,089
<i>♪ With the light of... ♪</i>

532
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,759
So I decided
to investigate him myself.

533
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,346
<i>♪ And I will not be ashamed ♪</i>

534
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,598
<i>♪ For my Savior knows my name ♪</i>

535
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,517
I started researching
everything about him,

536
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:13,147
from papers written, to articles,

537
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:18,361
to conferences he had attended, to blogs.

538
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:22,949
<i>♪ It don't matter anywhere I lay ♪</i>

539
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,867
It was so much research.

540
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,119
<i>♪ All my tears be washed away ♪</i>

541
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,164
I had just papers everywhere

542
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,542
to prove that I wasn't some crazy maniac.

543
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,628
<i>♪ All my tears be washed away ♪</i>

544
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,546
He wanted me to keep quiet.

545
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,548
And he wanted me to keep quiet

546
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,301
because he knew
that there were more siblings.

547
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,853
My husband
gave me a DNA test as a gift,

548
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,733
and then I got a message saying,

549
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,819
"I think we're related."

550
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,659
When it all hit me, I kind of

551
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,329
just sat and stared
for the rest of the day.

552
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,583
And then, for the next couple of weeks,
had a complete identity crisis,

553
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,294
and I couldn't look in the mirror.

554
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,255
I didn't wanna think
about where I got my hair from,

555
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,923
or where I got my eyes from,

556
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,801
because I had always thought
those were from my dad.

557
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:29,056
There was never any reason
that I would have questioned anything.

558
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,350
My parents trusted their doctor,

559
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,228
who said that it would be
better for me to not know,

560
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,397
and that I would never find out.

561
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,570
Every time
that a new sibling pops up,

562
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,449
I know that I'm going to call them,

563
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,411
and I know
that, um, I'm going to ruin their life.

564
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:56,375
It's hard because we know
what we went through.

565
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:00,046
And we're making someone else
go through this exact same thing.

566
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:07,595
The first people who reached out
to me were Julie and Jacoba.

567
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,641
I messaged them back and said,
"I need some time to process."

568
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,226
"I'll reach back out later."

569
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,729
Um, and so
it was probably a couple of months

570
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,815
before I, um, actually reached out

571
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,526
to... to have a conversation with anyone.

572
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,861
Um,

573
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,405
your world is changing.

574
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,204
When you have
new siblings pop up,

575
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,040
you are on the phone with them for hours

576
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,335
because it's the worst day of their life.

577
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,340
You've lived that over and over and over.

578
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,936
I asked
for a DNA test for Christmas,

579
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,563
and I was really confused

580
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,233
'cause all of these random names to me

581
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,653
were popping up,
and it said, "Close Family."

582
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,656
And so I really did not know
what "Close Family" meant.

583
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,325
It did... did not even...
I did not even think,

584
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,828
"Oh, brother or sister,"
I didn't even think, "Cousin."

585
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,163
I got a message
that a new sibling popped up,

586
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,417
and I logged in,
and it said, you know, "Lisa,"

587
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,920
and her last name,
and I was like, "Huh, I know her."

588
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,507
Her husband taught
my daughter on the softball team.

589
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,761
Um, my daughter and her daughter
played basketball together.

590
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,165
I sent her a message, and I said,

591
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,849
"Hey, did you happen
to do an Ancestry test?"

592
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,768
She said, "Well, do you know
about the Dr. Cline story?"

593
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,520
And she said, "He's our father."

594
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,899
And I honestly, I started laughing.

595
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,362
I... I was... thought Julie was kind of crazy.
I was like, "What are you talking about?"

596
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,031
"There... there's no way he can be my dad."

597
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,951
And then I called my mom.

598
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,999
I said, "Hey, Mom, did you and Dad
ever have any issues conceiving me?"

599
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,710
She said, "Well, I didn't,
but yeah, your dad did."

600
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,422
And so my heart dropped a little bit.

601
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,216
And she said,
"He actually had a low sperm count,

602
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,636
and his doctor recommended us
to a specialist."

603
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,931
I said, "Mom,
was this specialist in Indianapolis?"

604
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,600
And she said, "Yeah, why?"

605
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,977
And I said, "Was it Dr. Donald Cline?"

606
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,520
And she said, "Yes."

607
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,316
She said,

608
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,985
"I went and had the procedure done twice,

609
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:32,490
but both times your father
was there with me and provided a sample."

610
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,538
And so, at that point,
I realized my mom and dad had no idea.

611
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:43,876
They thought all along
that I was my dad's.

612
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,091
I worry for my kids,

613
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:55,387
especially I have siblings
that live in the same town as me,

614
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,871
and our kids go to school together.

615
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,518
And so, I've had to have the talk
with my daughter about,

616
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,271
"You've got to be careful
when you start dating."

617
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,651
"We got to be aware
of who this person is,"

618
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,153
but it's definitely a huge concern.

619
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,950
When we get a new sibling alert,

620
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,204
you're praying,
"Please don't let it be somebody I know."

621
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,581
Or "Please don't let it be
somebody I dated."

622
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,584
And I'm sure it's bound to happen.

623
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:36,303
The majority of us live in,
like, a 25-mile radius of each other.

624
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,349
There's also quite a few
that live within minutes of Cline.

625
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,152
I walk around,

626
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,447
and I could be related to anyone.

627
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:02,037
I mean, it's just common for me
to pass people on the street,

628
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,665
um, at work, wherever I may be,

629
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,376
and, I mean, I'll look at them and think,

630
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,421
"Oh, the way you stand, the way you look."

631
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,965
"You could be related to me."

632
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:21,223
We live in this small community.

633
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,436
Everyone that you interact with

634
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,980
appears to have
some sort of connection to Cline.

635
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,984
My dentist across the street
was a patient of his.

636
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:37,823
My next-door neighbor
was the nurse to one of my half-siblings,

637
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,159
and then there's this connection,

638
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,702
or there's that connection.

639
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,580
"Oh, my mom saw them at the nail salon."

640
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,637
I think without a doubt,
there are probably people that I've met

641
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,265
that are my half-sibling,
and I just don't even know it.

642
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,767
They don't even know it.

643
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,959
Who knows
how many siblings we have?

644
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,177
I had emailed Dr. Cline
and told him,

645
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,888
"We're moving forward with the story.
We would be using his name."

646
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:47,935
You know, "This is the time
for you to come clean to the public."

647
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,106
So, finally, he said, "If there's no audio
and no video, I will meet with you."

648
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,317
I asked him if he wanted
to come to FOX 59.

649
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,819
He said no. I said,

650
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,488
"There's a restaurant
close to the TV station."

651
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,251
And I wanted to be close to the TV station

652
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,117
because I wanted
to make sure for my safety.

653
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,786
I wanted it to be someplace
that I felt safe.

654
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,708
My boss at that time wanted me
to take our security guard with us

655
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,210
because she feared for my safety.

656
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,213
We knew that Dr. Cline
did not want to, quote, "be outed,"

657
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:20,092
and Jacoba told me that he carried a gun.

658
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,261
We thought that he was desperate.

659
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:29,226
<i>She is, um, uh,
demanding I meet with... with them.</i>

660
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,981
<i>They're going to force me to do this.</i>

661
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,316
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- I've gotta tell the truth.</i>

662
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,194
<i>- Mm-hmm. Well...
- And I don't want to do that.</i>

663
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,697
I was very nervous,

664
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,867
and when he came in,
it was within minutes he's asking me

665
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,286
if guns are allowed in the restaurant.

666
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,830
And I'm thinking,
"What a weird thing to say to me."

667
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:53,417
Then I'm looking down, and it looks like
he has a gun underneath his sweater.

668
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,003
There's something bulging
on the side, and I'm thinking,

669
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,381
"I don't wanna be crazy,
but is there any chance

670
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,592
that he could pull out a gun
and shoot me?"

671
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,218
I honestly thought that.

672
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,558
One of the first things
he said in our conversation

673
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,226
was that he knew where I lived,

674
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,895
and he knew where I was from.

675
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,355
Remember, this was
after he had said before,

676
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,274
"Be careful."

677
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,444
The meeting was about an hour long,

678
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,405
and I feel like he was begging me

679
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,200
to not air the story.

680
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,660
He said, "It will ruin my marriage."

681
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:32,372
"It will hurt my church.
I'm an elder at the church."

682
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:37,711
I let him know that we have
that burden to tell the truth,

683
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,047
and the truth matters.

684
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,849
So that's when, like,
the whole whirlwind just started with him,

685
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,186
and strange things started happening.

686
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,066
I had woke up one day,

687
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:03,028
and all of the lug nuts
were missing off of my car.

688
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,323
And I'm talking all four tires.

689
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,249
And that's scary.

690
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,460
So, yeah.

691
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,128
Um...

692
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,591
And you can't tell me
that that's like some freak...

693
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,425
Yeah.

694
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,223
I was hacked.

695
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:36,228
Everything that I had saved
to a Google Drive

696
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:40,440
of publications of Cline was just erased,

697
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:45,988
and every single email
regarding him was gone.

698
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,493
Soon after I went public,

699
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,954
I started getting harassing phone calls,

700
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,081
like the cemetery

701
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,250
asking if I wanted to buy a plot

702
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,210
for me to be buried in.

703
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,299
I think it was to rattle me.

704
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,508
Um...

705
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,014
to... to re-traumatize me
so that I would be quiet.

706
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:18,270
I don't think he wanted, um, any of us
to talk publicly if he could help it.

707
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,067
In my gut, I feel
like we're being harassed and stalked

708
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,944
to get us to shut up,

709
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:29,197
especially when Cline called
and threatened me over the phone.

710
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,244
<i>What you're doing is
that you're telling the world,</i>

711
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,248
<i>and the world doesn't need to know.</i>

712
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,462
<i>- I...
- I'm not trying to do harm.</i>

713
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,881
<i>Well, you are.</i>

714
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,970
I'm not scared of you.

715
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,224
You can threaten me,

716
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,436
but I will never back down.

717
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,399
I am going to expose you.

718
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,949
And I'm gonna expose
all of your secrets.

719
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,124
I found out that

720
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,002
in 1963...

721
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,547
...he was driving...

722
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:39,351
...and this little girl
darted out between two cars...

723
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,565
...and he hit her.

724
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:58,120
No!

725
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,918
She ended up dying.

726
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:11,466
He has told everybody
that's when he changed his life.

727
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,511
That's when he found God.

728
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,226
That traumatized him.

729
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,230
After that, he became more religious

730
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:28,650
and, um, churchgoing
than he had been before.

731
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,946
Maybe he thought
that this was his way of giving back,

732
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,240
that he took a life
that really wasn't his fault.

733
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,242
Now, he was going to give back.

734
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,954
Maybe that was a psychological process
going through his mind.

735
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:46,084
But it doesn't really matter
because that should not have been a way

736
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,712
that he was trying...
to try to, uh, make amends

737
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,881
for some terrible accident that happened.

738
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,428
He was very religious,

739
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,891
had very deep roots,

740
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:04,478
and he and his wife taught
marriage counseling in their church.

741
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,146
They taught Sunday school.

742
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,233
And whenever he was
in the office and all of us were there,

743
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:14,696
he would sit down, and we would wait,
and he would say a prayer.

744
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,992
He, at some point, asked me

745
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,495
if I was Jewish,

746
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,581
and I said yes.

747
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,627
And I said, "And by the way,
I'm very uncomfortable with your office

748
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,088
full of all kinds of Christian sayings."

749
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,299
Things like,
"If you want to get into heaven,

750
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,343
you need to be Christian."

751
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,938
Yeah. I knew... I knew Donald Cline.

752
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,819
The church is set up
where they have an eldership.

753
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:57,155
So they have seven or eight men

754
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,076
that governed the church body
as far as what was taught,

755
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,579
and he was one of those elders.

756
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:11,545
We would go over
to his house for baptisms.

757
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:17,843
Literally, 50 to 100 people
would attend baptisms

758
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,137
right there in their...
at their swimming pool.

759
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,350
That's where
we really got to know them.

760
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,228
From a Christian perspective,
you have to say,

761
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,438
"Hey, we... we all have
skeletons in our closet."

762
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,650
"We all have done things
that we regret doing."

763
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,905
I know that he and God
have reconciled that.

764
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:45,078
That he's been forgiven,
and that he has moved on from that,

765
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,164
and he's a different person now.

766
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:52,335
He portrays himself
as this godly man.

767
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,629
And I know we all make mistakes,

768
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,549
but I think there's more behind this.

769
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,259
What made him

770
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,722
every day wake up
and decide to go into his work,

771
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,391
masturbate,

772
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,479
and place it unknowingly
inside women without their consent.

773
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,527
He could've stopped at any point,

774
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:21,406
but he kept doing it
over and over and over and over.

775
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:41,176
Growing up, I kind of knew
that something was off.

776
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,719
Something was different.

777
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,977
You know,
why do I got blond hair, blue eyes?

778
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,982
Everyone in my family
has dark eyes and dark hair.

779
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:03,490
So, I got an Ancestry kit
just to figure out where I came from.

780
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,787
When Ancestry results
came through, my coworker said,

781
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:13,208
"Well, you'll have
11, 15 hits on Ancestry."

782
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:18,129
Well, when I opened up mine,
I had over 3,000 hits.

783
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,970
And then immediately after that,

784
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,554
Jacoba called me.

785
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,390
"I'm your sister."

786
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,309
And she told me the truth.

787
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:37,440
I don't even know how to tell you
the emotions that came over my head.

788
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,529
Took me to an incredibly dark place.

789
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,532
Why?

790
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,201
Why feel the need to do this?

791
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,704
Is it to... to further your career?

792
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,458
Is it to be the best of the best?

793
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,460
Is this to create life?

794
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,505
Is this some sort of sexual thing?

795
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,632
Like, I don't know.

796
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,303
I feel like he's hiding
something more sinister.

797
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:17,689
Jason, we talked on the phone
a lot before we got to meet.

798
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,024
Hey, how are you?

799
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,694
This is crazy.

800
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:23,820
I know!

801
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,448
Jason and I are very similar.

802
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,908
Like, we can
read through people's bullshit.

803
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,203
When someone isn't religious,

804
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,665
and you're gonna use
religious verses to justify your actions,

805
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,625
that just makes it even more...

806
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,309
Worse. I would have just laughed at him.

807
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,339
Well, and it makes it even more
of a reasoning of people saying,

808
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,175
"That right there is why
I would never be religious

809
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:47,093
because of fuck nuts like you."

810
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,928
And it took all I had in me

811
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,974
to talk to him on the phone
that day without going off.

812
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,185
And I thought,
"You've just got to remain calm

813
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,896
because you're recording this,
and try to get as much out."

814
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,023
Let me hear it.

815
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,862
<i>You know, I know
that nothing happens without God,</i>

816
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,406
<i>um, allowing it.</i>

817
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,147
Um...

818
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,577
<i>See,
I think that's where our problem is.</i>

819
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,179
<i>I don't think that God
should have allowed it in the first place,</i>

820
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:19,084
<i>and I really think that we ask ourselves
every day, "Why are we here?"</i>

821
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,754
<i>I think that's, like,
a lot of our problems.</i>

822
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:24,756
<i>Yeah.</i>

823
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:29,928
<i>Well, you know,
I mentioned one of my favorite, um...</i>

824
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:35,934
<i>One of my favorite scriptures
was Jeremiah 1:5.</i>

825
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,853
<i>If you'll remember, it says,</i>

826
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,524
<i>"Before I formed you
in your mother's womb, I knew you."</i>

827
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,609
<i>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

828
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,692
<i>Um,</i>

829
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:50,615
<i>and... and that tells me,
and it should tell everybody</i>

830
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:54,911
<i>that no one is born as a mistake.</i>

831
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,998
Before I knew you, in your mother...
What it... What was it? It's...

832
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,335
"Before I formed you in
your mother's womb, I knew you."

833
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,629
Jeremiah 1:5.

834
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,673
Which really just kinda...

835
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:12,345
nails it all home
that he knew what he was doing.

836
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,890
He knew exactly what he was doing with us.

837
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,982
I've just become obsessed with the story

838
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,901
and trying to piece everything together.

839
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,988
When I was sent an email

840
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:32,740
from someone
at the Attorney General's office,

841
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,161
I would go through,
and the person that sent me the email,

842
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:39,122
and every person
that was copied in on that email,

843
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,291
I would search them on Facebook.

844
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,377
And one of the people with the state

845
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,422
has a "Quiverfull" email address.

846
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,841
That's when it was...

847
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:53,136
"What is Quiverfull?
Like, what the hell is it?"

848
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,099
<i>God says, "Children are a blessing."</i>

849
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,477
<i>"We should want to have
our quiver full of them..."</i>

850
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,855
Quiverfull.
It's essentially a cult

851
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,983
aimed to having
as many children as possible.

852
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:10,778
<i>If a man with his wife
has a lot of children,</i>

853
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,906
<i>he will send them out as arrows.</i>

854
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,034
<i>He's like a warrior for God,
and he sends his children out</i>

855
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:19,662
<i>as arrows into the world,
who will be ambassadors for God.</i>

856
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,252
<i>The children are raised
to actively participate in government,</i>

857
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,213
<i>to actively run for office,</i>

858
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:31,925
<i>to seek positions of political prominence,</i>

859
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:36,012
<i>and eventually that the civil law
will actually be the Bible.</i>

860
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,766
Lo and behold, Jeremiah 1:5,

861
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,976
the verse that he kept using

862
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,479
is one of the Bible verses

863
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,190
that Quiverfull uses.

864
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:53,112
Basically, for them,
women are just... You... you breed.

865
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,784
Was Cline in this Quiverfull movement?

866
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:06,251
Were all of us part
of some sick, twisted, secret society?

867
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,589
There's so many theories
that I've thought of in my head.

868
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,554
I think the philosophies

869
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:21,599
or the beliefs of the Quiverfull movement
seem so outrageous to me

870
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,602
that it's hard for me
to actually believe that it's real.

871
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,564
I agree with that
and that we could even be a part of it.

872
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,481
Mm-hmm.

873
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,565
Yeah.

874
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:34,237
With the Quiverfull theory,
back when we were all conceived,

875
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,991
that theory was
to produce more of the white race

876
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:42,745
because they were in fear
that other races were infiltrating that

877
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,331
and the white race
would eventually disappear.

878
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:46,832
I mean,

879
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,128
when you look at that wall of babies,

880
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,214
it is all Caucasian babies.

881
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,888
It's crazy because every time
we get a DNA match,

882
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,142
it's like, "Yep.
Looks like one of the Cline boys,"

883
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,769
or "Looks like a Cline girl."

884
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,523
Most of us have blond hair

885
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,859
and blue eyes.

886
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,615
I hate to say this
'cause it sounds so... But it's almost like

887
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,911
we're like this perfect Aryan clan,

888
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:27,832
and... it's disgusting.

889
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:31,461
It's sad that we have
to have conspiracy theories

890
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,463
to understand why he did this.

891
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,506
If he would just tell us,

892
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,383
then we wouldn't have to go through

893
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,594
of trying to find
all these different reasons...

894
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,471
Life would be easier for him if he did.

895
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,139
It would help all of us heal too.

896
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,433
But you're not gonna
get that from somebody

897
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:49,354
that does not have
compassion or any empathy.

898
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,857
It's disgusting to sit there
and lay in bed at night,

899
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,486
and wonder if the person that created you

900
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,197
is some racist bigot,

901
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,368
and he used my mom as a pawn.

902
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,538
And he did it
over and over and over again.

903
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,375
Ugh.

904
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:13,920
Ugh!

905
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,549
I didn't ask to be born.

906
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,177
I didn't ask to be born
into this situation.

907
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,472
But this is my life.

908
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,766
But it's not your fault.

909
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:31,104
No, it's not, but then you have this man
who shares half of my DNA.

910
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,356
Our DNA.

911
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,695
There's just
so many theories, and I...

912
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,323
I don't think we'll ever know
why he was doing it,

913
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,449
but

914
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:49,288
I want him to have to pay for it.
I want an investigation.

915
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,458
I want him punished.

916
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,219
The Attorney General's
office didn't give a shit.

917
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,181
We were told that
they couldn't give us any information

918
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,891
and we weren't allowed to know.

919
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:13,187
And we just kind of got disregarded.

920
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,816
The one person that we had
was Angela Ganote,

921
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:20,153
calling and asking them,
"What are you going to do?"

922
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:26,576
I had started back in 2015,

923
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,455
asking the Attorney General
for an interview,

924
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:36,043
asking anything that I could know about
this, and they would tell me nothing.

925
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:40,339
And then I also reached out
to the Marion County prosecutor

926
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,341
and said, "Is anyone listening?"

927
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,385
Finally, the spokesperson

928
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,888
from the Marion County
prosecutor's office said,

929
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,474
"Angela, I'm sorry.
I don't... Somehow I missed it."

930
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:54,729
I laid out a long paragraph
of the whole story and what had happened.

931
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,732
I had even sent our story
that had aired and said,

932
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,484
"Did you watch our story?

933
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:02,236
I've been asking these questions
for more than a year,

934
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,404
and I'm getting nowhere."

935
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:07,658
"And I feel like it's time that
the prosecutor, or the Attorney General,

936
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,995
or somebody sits down
and answers the questions that I have."

937
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,749
When we got the media inquiry,

938
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:19,921
there hadn't been
any true investigation done anywhere yet.

939
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,506
But at the end of the day,

940
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,425
there's just no crime that touches

941
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,093
this particular act.

942
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,094
That's our problem.

943
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,060
So I remember we were sitting there,

944
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,314
and, um, you know, we're asking him,

945
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,107
"How is this not rape?"

946
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,360
I don't deny
that it was a sexual violation.

947
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:45,238
But legally, it isn't a sexual violation.

948
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,825
"I feel like my mother was raped"

949
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:52,537
is a valid human emotional statement.

950
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:57,124
But..."Dr. Cline committed rape"

951
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:01,045
is a legal assertion that was not true,

952
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:03,589
and I wasn't gonna put it on paper

953
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,966
with my signature.

954
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:07,176
And I said, "What about battery?"

955
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,179
And... he got rude with me.

956
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:14,183
He said, "I don't know how many times
I'm gonna have to tell you this."

957
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:18,187
"I can't charge him with battery.
It wasn't battery."

958
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,398
I, uh, was so pissed.

959
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,400
I looked at Tim Delaney, and I said,

960
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:25,069
"So if I spit in your face right now,

961
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,320
it's not battery?"

962
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,283
And he said, "It is,
because you'd be spitting on me."

963
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,579
And I'm like, "What the fuck?"

964
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,790
"So a doctor can go jack off

965
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,377
and put their sperm in a woman

966
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,672
who's their patient that did not consent

967
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,549
to have their doctor do that,

968
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,469
but yet, you're gonna tell me
that if I spit in your face,

969
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,847
I'd be arrested and charged with battery?"

970
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:56,976
Jacoba and a lot of the individuals
touched by this were very emotional,

971
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:02,315
and had, um, a feeling
that what I was there to do,

972
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,276
wasn't to apply the law

973
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,863
to determine whether or not
Dr. Cline had committed a crime.

974
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,283
They thought I was there
to deliver catharsis.

975
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:13,783
And I wasn't.

976
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,420
There's unequal application of the law.

977
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:26,857
It happens every day,
it happens all over the United States,

978
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,121
and it happens here in Indiana.

979
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,718
Was there fraud?

980
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,511
Was there something else?

981
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:37,224
I just didn't feel like
it was investigated enough

982
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,186
to look at
what could he have been charged with.

983
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:43,356
There was never
a good explanation in my mind.

984
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,984
I had a copy
of the Indiana sexual assault law,

985
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:52,031
and I said, "Surely, there's somewhere
in this law that you can say..."

986
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:55,117
He says, "No, it has to have
both components. It has to have force

987
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,411
and non-consent."

988
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,080
When you talk about rape,

989
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,749
there is a provision
in Indiana law that says,

990
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,626
"Rape can include conduct

991
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:07,797
which a victim does not know is sexual,
but the perpetrator knows is sexual."

992
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,840
And that, I think,
is actually the closest charge,

993
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,344
because in order for him
to produce this sperm sample,

994
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,805
he had to masturbate
in very close proximity

995
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,057
to the office where a patient was waiting,

996
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,725
unclothed from the waist down,

997
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,520
with a paper cloth covering her knees,

998
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,230
and knees spread apart.

999
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,191
Who's to say when this touch

1000
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,986
stops becoming sexual
and starts becoming clinical?

1001
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:34,281
I think even if he's not thinking
of the patient in a sexual sense,

1002
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:37,702
the very fact that he's still
under the effects of physical arousal

1003
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,662
makes this a sexual touching.

1004
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,916
Even if he's thinking of his wife
or a pink fuzzy bunny rabbit,

1005
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,835
it is still a sexual act.

1006
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,381
But I also think
we have to see Tim Delaney

1007
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,550
in the context
in which this case was brought.

1008
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:55,011
And so when I interviewed Tim Delaney,

1009
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,346
he said that Indiana juries

1010
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,725
were not willing to buy
rape-by-deception theories.

1011
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:04,937
The jury is going to say,
"This woman consented to insemination."

1012
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,190
"This woman wanted a child."
And the question is always out there,

1013
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:12,319
"Does this woman's desire for a child
legitimate Donald Cline's deception?"

1014
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,697
And unfortunately, that is a question

1015
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:19,076
that Tim Delaney had to weigh
would enter into the minds of jurors.

1016
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:23,664
If he asked me
if it'd be okay for him to be the donor,

1017
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:26,459
I would have not said yes.

1018
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,710
I would say no.

1019
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,799
It was a violation of him into me.

1020
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:39,096
The issue for me is there was no consent.

1021
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,683
He didn't give me a choice.

1022
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:48,189
The Attorney General's office
had at least

1023
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:50,733
reached out to Dr. Cline at some point

1024
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:53,402
and asked him if he...
if he had used his sperm,

1025
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,655
or had asked some sort of question
because Dr. Cline told me that.

1026
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,325
He told me that he filled it out,

1027
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,702
and that he denied anything,
that he wasn't the father.

1028
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,246
I don't know what's in that letter
'cause I've never seen it,

1029
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,873
but I know what our conversation was.

1030
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,960
Dr. Cline told me that he talked
with the Attorney General's office

1031
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,504
through paperwork,

1032
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,341
and that... he was not the father.

1033
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,887
That was really what ended up
getting him in trouble,

1034
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,681
because he lied to me, and I knew it,

1035
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,643
and he lied on the paperwork
to the Attorney General's office.

1036
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:28,270
So at one point,
I reached out to the Attorney General,

1037
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,231
and say, "You know he's lying to you."

1038
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:34,777
He lied and said
that he never used his sperm

1039
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,904
to inseminate his patients.

1040
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:41,283
Only after we determined
that the Attorney General's office

1041
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,827
had sent those letters

1042
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,996
were we able to come up
with a theory for how to proceed.

1043
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,666
We wanted to nail him with something,

1044
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,918
and the fact that
we finally got something,

1045
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,503
it was like a "hurrah" moment.

1046
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:54,505
And not only that,

1047
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:57,216
he also added that he was going to sue me

1048
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,968
for libel and slander.

1049
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:02,930
Denying is obstruction of justice,

1050
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:06,767
but denying and threatening,
and, to paraphrase, saying,

1051
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,270
"Do you know who I am?"
was more than enough.

1052
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,666
It was like, "Eureka!" The, you know...
The bathwater started spilling out.

1053
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,859
I said, "Oh my God, we've got an angle."

1054
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:37,256
After we began the investigation,

1055
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:41,177
obviously the first step
was to get DNA from Dr. Cline.

1056
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:48,726
He was sick.

1057
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,895
He had pneumonia, I believe.

1058
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,855
So he said, "Don't come too close."

1059
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,650
And we said,
"We have a search warrant for your DNA."

1060
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,279
He asked a little bit
about "What is this all about?"

1061
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,947
But he knew what it was all about.

1062
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:08,162
Detective Sergeant Carmen Walker

1063
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,206
of the Marion County
Sheriff's Office said,

1064
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,957
"We need you to open your mouth."

1065
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,586
And he complied.

1066
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,429
He did not look like he was enjoying it.

1067
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:55,668
It came back 99.9997%

1068
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,420
that I am his biological daughter.

1069
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,340
<i>And how many times
did you use your own sample?</i>

1070
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:03,592
<i>Sparingly, but</i>

1071
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:09,139
<i>keep in mind,
we're talking 30 to 35 years ago,</i>

1072
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:12,268
<i>and I... I can't remember.</i>

1073
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,062
<i>All the records have been shredded.</i>

1074
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:21,277
<i>The fertility doctor
at the center of a controversial case</i>

1075
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,654
<i>is headed back to court
to answer criminal charges.</i>

1076
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:26,657
<i>Dr. Donald Cline is charged
with two felony counts</i>

1077
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:30,703
<i>of obstruction of justice
for statements he made to investigators.</i>

1078
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,830
<i>The retired
Indianapolis fertility doctor</i>

1079
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:36,083
<i>now plans to plead guilty
to obstruction of justice.</i>

1080
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,503
<i>Prosecutors say he intentionally
misled investigators about a case</i>

1081
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:42,339
<i>that's turned dozens
of people's lives upside down.</i>

1082
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,174
And it was literally 20 months ago

1083
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:47,219
that I got a Facebook question to me,
"Angela, can you help me?"

1084
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,973
And thank you for believing in them,
because no one else did but you.

1085
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:52,141
Yeah, thank you.

1086
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:53,600
He didn't want to go to trial

1087
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:55,519
because more information would come out,

1088
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:58,814
and then also,
he'd probably get more of a punishment.

1089
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:00,566
So he changed his plea to guilty.

1090
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:11,952
I felt good
that day at the court hearing.

1091
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,790
Even though I knew
that all he was being charged with

1092
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,501
was two counts of obstruction of justice,

1093
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:23,005
I thought, "Fucking finally. Something."

1094
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:30,804
I didn't wanna make
eye contact with him. I...

1095
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,433
I was afraid of him.

1096
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:42,274
Uh, he actually walked right
past me and brushed up against me, and...

1097
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:46,153
it almost brought me to my knees.

1098
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:51,408
That was my first time seeing that man

1099
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:56,497
and being that close to him,
and there was no regard for us.

1100
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,126
<i>Your honor, I'm asking for mercy</i>

1101
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,213
<i>and compassion for myself.</i>

1102
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:09,593
<i>I've tried to live out my life</i>

1103
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,346
<i>showing honesty and care to others,</i>

1104
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:14,640
<i>and I will continue to do so.</i>

1105
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,683
He looked very old

1106
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,312
and weak, and part of me thought,

1107
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:24,358
"Is this an act that you're putting on
to get the judge to go easier on you?"

1108
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,490
I was allowed to give
a victim-impact statement

1109
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:35,411
because I was one of the originals
that filed a complaint with the state.

1110
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:40,916
My hope was that the judge
would be appalled by this,

1111
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:45,254
and that he would at least get,
like, some jail time.

1112
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,881
<i>These are my words to Cline.</i>

1113
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:51,635
<i>Every time I or my half-siblings
look up our name,</i>

1114
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:53,679
<i>we all have the same issue tied to you.</i>

1115
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,472
<i>It has caused anguish in everyone,</i>

1116
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,058
<i>and some of us have
wanted to die from this pain.</i>

1117
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:03,564
<i>For 30 years, my half-sister, Julie,
believed her dad was her biological dad...</i>

1118
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,232
<i>Objection, Your Honor.</i>

1119
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,151
<i>Relevancy.</i>

1120
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:12,072
We had agreed
to the wording of the statement.

1121
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:13,699
Literally redlined it.

1122
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,453
And I had things crossed out
or highlighted that you can't say.

1123
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,371
<i>Because of your denials,</i>

1124
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,832
<i>I feel you have
no consideration for the mothers</i>

1125
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:24,793
<i>who came to you,
us as your biological children,</i>

1126
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,671
<i>or your wife
and the four children you had with her.</i>

1127
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:31,133
<i>It was always about you.
You lied. You still lie.</i>

1128
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:34,303
<i>You even have your family believing you,
and that sickens me.</i>

1129
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,513
<i>- Our mothers trusted you...
- Objection!</i>

1130
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,056
She... she went for it.

1131
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,060
I don't know if I would've had the courage
to do that in front of a judge.

1132
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,311
But, you know...

1133
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:45,731
<i>I'm asking you to look at the
depth of the reasons he is charged with...</i>

1134
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:46,857
<i>Objection!</i>

1135
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,650
What we're really getting at

1136
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:51,195
is the inability of victims
to tell their stories.

1137
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,280
Those who testify can only testify

1138
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,991
to... to what is relevant
to a criminal proceeding.

1139
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:58,827
But... And what is relevant
to Cline's proceeding

1140
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,330
was not what happened in the '70s or '80s,

1141
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:03,165
not the births, not the fertility fraud.

1142
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,583
It was the lies to the state.

1143
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,170
In Cline's proceeding,
the state was the victim. They weren't.

1144
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:12,132
<i>I do want to reiterate, probably
for the fifth or sixth time at this point,</i>

1145
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:15,219
<i>that the court, by law, can only consider</i>

1146
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:18,263
<i>the charges
that Dr. Cline's plead guilty to,</i>

1147
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,599
<i>the obstruction of... of justice charges.</i>

1148
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,728
<i>Obviously, it would be inappropriate
for me to consider outside of that realm.</i>

1149
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:28,023
What we asked for the judge to do

1150
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:29,733
was twofold.

1151
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:35,030
One, to make sure
that these crimes remained as felonies

1152
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:37,533
on his record, and two,

1153
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,160
deliver executed time,
an executed sentence,

1154
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,454
meaning time served in jail.

1155
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:46,333
<i>We received a number
of support letters for Dr. Cline.</i>

1156
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:48,296
<i>These are letters
from members of the community,</i>

1157
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:52,297
<i>former patients, and members
of Dr. Cline's family and church.</i>

1158
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,551
<i>These individuals have known
Dr. Cline for many years.</i>

1159
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:58,637
<i>And they evidence
a strong connection to his family,</i>

1160
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,973
<i>the community, and that rehabilitation</i>

1161
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,601
<i>is not only possible
but actually has already taken place here.</i>

1162
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,272
A lot of folks submitted letters

1163
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:10,816
on his behalf to the judge.

1164
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:14,027
I believe there was one
that came from a prosecutor

1165
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,989
from Boone County,
which is where he lives,

1166
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,575
saying that "This guy is a good man,"

1167
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,035
you know, "He should get some leniency."

1168
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,511
Is that an odd thing
for a prosecutor to write to a judge

1169
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,542
if it's a friend?

1170
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:35,173
I'd do well not to comment
on that particular question.

1171
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,137
That's when I, in my gut,

1172
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:42,472
felt like the state was corrupt.

1173
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:43,640
There were people corrupt,

1174
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,726
and they were friends
with him or something.

1175
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:49,313
<i>Please remember
that whatever happens during sentencing,</i>

1176
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,940
<i>the people that love you
are gonna continue to love you.</i>

1177
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:56,570
The judge seemed
very sympathetic towards him,

1178
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:58,572
like on the verge of tears.

1179
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:02,034
<i>With the limited resources
that we have, overcrowding at the jail,</i>

1180
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,369
<i>and your lack of a criminal history,</i>

1181
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,539
<i>um, an executed sentence is nothing
that the court is gonna order.</i>

1182
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,208
I really wanted him to have jail time.

1183
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,168
I really did.

1184
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:14,588
I thought that that would bring
a little bit of closure to me.

1185
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,424
But... no.

1186
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:22,012
<i>I know that this is your
first offense, but Dr. Cline, I do believe</i>

1187
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:26,850
<i>that the facts support going ahead
and sentencing you as a level 6 felon.</i>

1188
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,604
<i>Um, as to fines and costs,</i>

1189
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:33,732
<i>sir, the court will fine you $500.</i>

1190
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:38,111
And so he got
the two Level 6 felonies

1191
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,781
with complete suspended sentences

1192
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:42,783
and a $500 fine,

1193
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,827
which is a slap in the fucking face.

1194
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,384
<i>Dr. Cline,
do you have any comment at all?</i>

1195
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:04,087
<i>Dr. Cline, what would you
change now if you could change anything?</i>

1196
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,726
This was a span of two years

1197
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:12,104
from me filing a complaint,

1198
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:15,232
to them actually,
finally doing something about it.

1199
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,110
And...

1200
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:22,989
...this judge just let this man

1201
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,367
pretty much off the hook.

1202
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,416
And I dread
every new match that comes.

1203
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:35,752
But they just keep coming,

1204
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:38,714
and you never know the day
that you're gonna wake up,

1205
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,632
and then they're going to be there.

1206
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,981
I just... Uh, I feel like he...

1207
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,819
That this was some sick

1208
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,072
game experiment for him.

1209
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,076
<i>As far as I know,</i>

1210
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,872
<i>all of the inseminations
that I did with my sample,</i>

1211
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,625
<i>um, and again it was sparingly,</i>

1212
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:18,462
<i>um, had a healthy baby.</i>

1213
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,506
It was, you know, important to my parents

1214
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:24,259
that it was someone that was healthy,

1215
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,512
and for him
to turn around and violate them

1216
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:31,057
and do this without their consent, and

1217
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:37,063
there's a lot of us
that have the same health issues.

1218
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,025
Almost every single one of us.

1219
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,239
I've been to so many doctors,
been to the Cleveland Clinic.

1220
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,617
They don't know what's wrong with me.

1221
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:50,326
I'm sick.

1222
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:55,540
And other, um, siblings have, um,

1223
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,418
autoimmune diseases and stuff.

1224
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,130
I have an autoimmune disease, yeah.

1225
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,132
It's, um, a blood clotting disorder,

1226
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:07,928
um, which I didn't know
until I had a miscarriage,

1227
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:11,223
and, uh, we were determining
what would have caused that.

1228
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,058
I mean, I've had...

1229
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:19,356
...colonoscopy, endoscopy, I've had...

1230
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:23,318
I mean, I've spent weeks in the hospital,

1231
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,987
losing 15 pounds at a time.

1232
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:31,743
I have a lot of digestive,
um, and colon issues, and

1233
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,788
no one on my mom's side does.

1234
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,543
In the early '70s,

1235
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:42,879
I had heard
that he was having trouble, uh, operating

1236
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,798
because he had rheumatoid arthritis.

1237
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:47,092
And he had... His hands were swelling up.

1238
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:50,720
I... I, at that time,
I felt I would hate to see him,

1239
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,723
his career of being a great surgeon end

1240
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:56,601
because he couldn't get
the right treatment for his arthritis.

1241
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,728
And so, I called our chief of medicine,

1242
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,647
told him about Cline's problems.

1243
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,441
And he said,
"Yeah. Well, let me call Dr. B. up there,"

1244
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,987
and Cline went down and met with him,
and he told him what to take, etcetera.

1245
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:11,700
So, once he got on the right medications,
he seemed to be fine.

1246
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:13,535
His symptoms abated.

1247
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:19,291
I know
in talking to a sperm bank,

1248
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,837
30% of the guys didn't even make it

1249
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,006
past the questionnaire

1250
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,341
because of what was in their family.

1251
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,386
History of cancer, history of whatever,

1252
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,847
even color blindness, for goodness sakes.

1253
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,391
Now, looking back at it, and being like,

1254
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:39,519
"Okay. He's got an autoimmune disease,

1255
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:44,190
um, and his sperm
wouldn't have even been allowed

1256
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:46,192
to be a donor because of that."

1257
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:49,487
Like, "Dude, you knew this."

1258
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,240
"You knew... you knew you had issues."

1259
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,576
"Like, how... how dare you?"

1260
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:57,287
Yeah.

1261
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,083
Now, there's the Don Cline we knew,

1262
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:06,338
that I knew, that I th... knew well.

1263
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:11,176
And there's the Don Cline
I would have never imagined.

1264
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,054
Yeah.

1265
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:17,140
Yeah. It broke my heart.

1266
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:25,147
Evil.

1267
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:29,110
And I... If Don was right here,
I'd say that right to his face.

1268
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:35,533
Still to this day,

1269
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:39,621
there are people
in his community that back him.

1270
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:44,459
And people that sit there and say,
"But he is such a wonderful man."

1271
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,212
And I just want to look at those people

1272
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:50,006
and say, "Well, then maybe
he should have put his sperm

1273
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,425
in your wife without her consent."

1274
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:55,178
"And then how would you like that?"

1275
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:09,859
I took a 23andMe DNA test because,

1276
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,362
about four or five years ago now,

1277
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:16,241
my children and I were both diagnosed
with a genetic disorder.

1278
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,202
I got the results back.

1279
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:24,124
And when I got to the genetic DNA family,

1280
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:27,419
there were half-siblings listed.

1281
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:30,588
And I honestly just thought,
"Oh, this is a mistake."

1282
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:33,299
Because by that time,

1283
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:40,015
I didn't know that my parents
had any type of fertility treatment

1284
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:42,851
other than receiving
fertility medications.

1285
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:48,940
So I kind of just put it out of my mind,
and didn't think anything of it.

1286
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:54,070
And then I had
a couple messages from Jacoba.

1287
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,574
And it basically said,

1288
01:23:57,657 --> 01:24:01,369
"I'm sure
you're confused by your results."

1289
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,955
"Feel free to contact me
with any questions."

1290
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:09,419
It didn't occur to me
that she was talking about the siblings,

1291
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:14,257
so I just
kind of disregarded that message.

1292
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:23,099
On December 9th of 2019,

1293
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:24,517
a <i>Dr. Phil</i> show aired.

1294
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:27,062
Well, question for you.

1295
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:29,064
How would you feel if you found out

1296
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,274
your mother's fertility doctor

1297
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,527
was actually your biological father?

1298
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:43,328
When the siblings walked out...

1299
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:47,207
Jacoba was introduced.

1300
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:52,545
You felt no remorse from him,
other than just the fear of being caught.

1301
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:55,173
He was not remorseful at all.

1302
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,259
- None?
- He just did not want it to be public.

1303
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:01,012
He told me,
"The world does not need to know."

1304
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:02,972
Wow.

1305
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:10,438
I, uh, quickly got my phone
and opened my 23andMe,

1306
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:15,401
and all of the siblings on that show
were listed as my half-siblings.

1307
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:20,490
So then I knew, I knew at that moment,

1308
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,827
that there... That we were a part of it.

1309
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:29,207
I was a patient
of Dr. Cline's for many years.

1310
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:35,046
I think he took each case very personally.

1311
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,589
At least he did with me.

1312
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,176
He delivered the girls,

1313
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:44,472
and he came over with his wife

1314
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,933
to see our babies at home.

1315
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,815
So this is a picture
of my twin sister and I

1316
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:57,068
right after delivery, in the incubator.

1317
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:01,030
And...

1318
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:10,331
this is the picture of Cline
holding me as an infant at the house.

1319
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,378
I was probably eight months old there.

1320
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:25,555
I had such mixed emotions in that

1321
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,684
the thought that he had used

1322
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:33,563
his own specimen to impregnate me

1323
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:38,443
made me kind of queasy
and sick to my stomach.

1324
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,778
Whereas, um...

1325
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:44,157
on the other hand,

1326
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,952
I thought about the fact
that because of his skills

1327
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,662
in operating on me,

1328
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:54,292
and... and clearing up some of the things
that were causing infertility,

1329
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,085
I was grateful to him.

1330
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:59,172
So I had this mix of emotions,

1331
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:02,383
and I have twin daughters

1332
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:06,137
who are absolutely delightful girls.

1333
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:08,640
And I...

1334
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,059
You know, you can't be angry

1335
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:14,687
when you have...
you have what you always dreamed of.

1336
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:20,652
Well, it was, um, complex for me because...

1337
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,907
I was 47 years old at the time,

1338
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,242
and to find out...

1339
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:34,499
...that the man I looked up to and emulated

1340
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,167
from the time I was small...

1341
01:27:38,127 --> 01:27:42,465
was not my biological father was crushing.

1342
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,427
That was the biggest part.

1343
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:49,555
I felt this need to protect him,

1344
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:51,724
and I didn't want people to know.

1345
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:59,274
But the other part of my story

1346
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:03,236
is that Don Cline
was also my fertility doctor.

1347
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:12,328
He was my main GYN.

1348
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:16,874
He took care of all my gynecological needs
for the two years that I saw him.

1349
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,918
He did my Pap exams.

1350
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,878
He did breast exams.

1351
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:28,928
I mean, I don't think
any grown woman wants...

1352
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:33,391
someone closely related to them,

1353
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:37,895
a member of the opposite sex,
to touch them in that way, in such...

1354
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:41,983
It's a very vulnerable position
that the patient is in.

1355
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:45,236
And to be touching and examining

1356
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:49,324
private areas of your body. It's just...

1357
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:57,498
It's... I can't... I can't even think
about it without getting upset.

1358
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:01,210
I didn't get to have
that knowledge. He knew.

1359
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:04,505
I didn't get to know that
or have the chance to say,

1360
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,924
"No. I would... I...
I'd rather I see someone else."

1361
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:11,637
"I don't... I don't want someone
who is biologically related to me

1362
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:13,181
to touch me in that way."

1363
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:15,016
I didn't get to do... know that.

1364
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:23,107
It's almost, you know,

1365
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,194
it's like... it's like a bad dream
that you... that's recurring.

1366
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,363
You wanna wake up.

1367
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:30,865
But every time you wake up,
it's not a dream.

1368
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:38,915
I just can't believe
how it was, you know, done to us.

1369
01:29:38,998 --> 01:29:43,503
I really can't. And for him
to act like nothing happened.

1370
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:45,755
I think that's the worst part of it.

1371
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:52,303
<i>I don't want you
to think that I do this...</i>

1372
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:56,182
<i>I did the insemination with my own sample</i>

1373
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:57,683
<i>very blasé.</i>

1374
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:03,022
<i>Was there a sexual connotation to it?</i>

1375
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,190
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

1376
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:08,236
<i>I don't look at these people</i>

1377
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:10,696
<i>and consider them to be my</i>

1378
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,532
<i>children.</i>

1379
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:18,204
I want zero relationship with him.

1380
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:25,420
He's not my father.

1381
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:32,927
I may share half of his DNA,

1382
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:36,681
but he's not my father,
and he never will be.

1383
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,357
I feel sorry for him
because his whole life to his wife,

1384
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:49,610
to his own children,
to his community, to his church,

1385
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:53,406
to his colleagues
in the hospital and his office.

1386
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:55,783
It's all a lie.

1387
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:01,247
I would like to see him
pay for what he did...

1388
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,835
...but I just, I feel like...

1389
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:09,797
there isn't gonna be any justice.

1390
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:12,425
I'm okay.

1391
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,888
This is not my issue. It's his.

1392
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:26,272
I think continually putting
his name and face in the media,

1393
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,736
and telling our story
was the absolute way to go.

1394
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,907
I'm not gonna run away from him.

1395
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:38,534
Not gonna run away from this story.

1396
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:42,788
If you were not even
experiencing problems with infertility,

1397
01:31:42,872 --> 01:31:46,125
if you saw Dr. Cline and you have a child,

1398
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:49,629
I think it is important,
very important, that you have a DNA test.

1399
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:53,382
Your child has a DNA test,
just to be certain that you know

1400
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,843
who the father is of that child.

1401
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,644
Instead of destroying me...

1402
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,899
you made me realize my self-worth.

1403
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,735
That's absolutely what you did.

1404
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:15,780
And you made me realize
what my purpose is too.

1405
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:16,948
And I'm a fighter.

1406
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:21,744
And I will fight for every sibling

1407
01:32:21,827 --> 01:32:24,789
that I have that I know,
that I don't know,

1408
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:27,708
and for every woman that you assaulted.

1409
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:32,213
And I will do this
until the fucking day I die.
