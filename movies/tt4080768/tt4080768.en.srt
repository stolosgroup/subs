00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:24,976
- You didn't take any corn at all?
- No.

4
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,850
Antoine's parents are
starting to plant it.

5
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:32,657
Sweetie, the day you have a husband,
you can ask him to plant corn.

6
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,700
But if you keep letting
them go one after another...

7
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:44,173
Your friends are faster.

8
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,233
I don't want to get married.

9
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:53,649
I don't want to get married.

10
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,740
What are you doing every night?

11
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,781
Getting home in the middle of the night.

12
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:05,514
I walk around.

13
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,922
Are you seeing anyone?

14
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:10,700
No.

15
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:13,968
- Is it Antoine?
- No.

16
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:20,211
You can't stay alone all your life.

17
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,006
Solitude is awful.

18
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm getting married in September.

19
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,441
Who to?

20
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,274
Pierre Coubin.

21
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,563
You love him?

22
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:21,362
I don't know.

23
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,276
I don't really know him. I mean,

24
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,989
I've known him all my life, but I
don't know if he'll make a good husband.

25
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,784
He seems nice.

26
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,267
He's ambitious, he wants
to go live in Limoges.

27
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:36,946
Oh, yeah, very ambitious.

28
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:39,732
Do you want to stay here all your life?

29
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:41,795
Yeah.

30
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,465
I like everything here.

31
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,329
We need to move on, Delphine.

32
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,014
We're not kids anymore.

33
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,319
What happened between
us doesn't matter to you?

34
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:01,530
It does.

35
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,775
Of course it does, but,

36
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,606
it wasn't serious.

37
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:21,065
- Hey.
- Hey.

38
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,899
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, just walking.

39
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:26,610
You?

40
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,585
- You want it?
- No, thanks.

41
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,165
You'll get caught someday.

42
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:39,352
Will you go to the dance in Aubusson?

43
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:41,104
Dunno.

44
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,938
We could go together.

45
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:47,903
I don't know, Antoine.

46
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:49,574
We'll see.

47
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:27,888
Where's Delphine?

48
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:29,406
I don't know.

49
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,586
Delphine.

50
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,926
Delphine?

51
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:53,078
Delphine?!

52
00:07:55,464 --> 00:07:57,911
PARIS SPRING 1971

53
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,679
The President welcomed, this
morning at the Élysée Palace,

54
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:04,961
11 mothers, with at
least 10 children each.

55
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,245
Mr. Pompidou awarded them the
Medal of the French Family.

56
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:13,018
And during an improvised speech, the
president spoke about the role of family.

57
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:16,675
"Raising kids is a lot of
work but it's rewarding."

58
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:21,334
"The notion of family is
threatened by the current climate."

59
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:24,941
"A climate emphasized by the
violence spreading everywhere."

60
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,158
"France can't become a dictatorship,

61
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:31,899
but the government must
act to stop this violence."

62
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,675
Hey!

63
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:06,292
- Hey, you're having fun?
- Yeah, it's your time for once!

64
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:09,994
- You're laughing now?
- Leave her alone!

65
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:13,632
Tarts!

66
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,316
Close the door!

67
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:22,653
Sluts!

68
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,283
Go fuck yourself!

69
00:09:27,852 --> 00:09:29,811
You see how he acted?

70
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:32,277
If we had stolen his
wallet, he'd run the same.

71
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,756
We did worse than steal his
wallet. We stole his virility.

72
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,772
Thank god you were here.

73
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:42,825
- You don't scare easily!
- He was threatening.

74
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:45,865
- He wasn't that dangerous.
- Really?

75
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:48,054
He was crazy.

76
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,564
Was it a dare?

77
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:51,495
No, it was to show them how it feels.

78
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,402
When it's our arse it's normal, when
it's theirs, they don't like it so much.

79
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:57,284
- Next time we do it to cops!
- Yeah!

80
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,929
What do you demonstrate for?

81
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,252
Women's rights.

82
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:05,344
The right to not be bothered
in the street for starters.

83
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:08,118
The right to do what we want, when we
want it, and with whoever we want to.

84
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:09,256
Don't you agree?

85
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:11,789
I don't know.

86
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:14,249
You don't feel like there
are things you can't do

87
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:15,625
because you're a woman?

88
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,767
I'm looking for a meeting, but
I don't really know about what.

89
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:08,612
All I know is that there's
women, and it's on Thursdays.

90
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:11,139
Oh, the hotheads? It's in the
lecture theater on the right.

91
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:32,599
You're being sectarian!
Our strength is to blend.

92
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:40,420
What men need to understand

93
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:43,299
is that for now, they don't belong here!

94
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:47,942
And I know what people'll say.

95
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,265
They'll say we're against men.

96
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,642
But we're not. We're not!

97
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:55,915
Besides, half the women
here are involved with a guy.

98
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:01,650
We're not against men,

99
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:04,103
we're for the women! For us!

100
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:07,564
I'm sorry,

101
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,752
I'm sorry but when there's a guy
around, a woman's attitude changes.

102
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:13,153
Her speech is different.
And even an educated woman,

103
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,900
when she's around a man,
whether she knows him or not,

104
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:19,114
she censors her speech and her thoughts.

105
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:23,693
What we want right now, is
to get back our free speech

106
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:26,691
without caring what the boyfriend,
boss or dad will think of it,

107
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:28,404
and talk between women.

108
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:33,335
OK, I agree with the separatism,

109
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:36,585
but in this case, there's a journalist
who wants to attend our meeting...

110
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:44,311
Down with the straight journalism!

111
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,558
Let everyone talk!

112
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:50,994
If even within Women's Lib
we can't agree, we're doomed!

113
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:53,922

I really didn't envision you
sitting at a desk all day long.

128
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:11,930
I envisionned you...

129
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,418
doing something more physical.

130
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,120
Oh yeah? Like what?

131
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,093
Swimming teacher.

132
00:14:18,327 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, you'd be good at that.

133
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,451
You need to be serious,
focused, and it's physical.

134
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:25,771
- And what do you do?
- Guess.

135
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,225
It's too difficult, I barely know you.

136
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:30,227
You have two attempts,
then you'll have a forfeit.

137
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:33,993
Saleswoman?

138
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:36,028
No, I'm not a saleswoman.

139
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,943
Last attempt.

140
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:40,602
Um... doctor?

141
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:42,503
Why do you think that?

142
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,449
Well, you speak well, so

143
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:47,917
it means you studied,

144
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:49,857
and you seem to care about others.

145
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:52,780
- Forget it, it's stupid.
- No, not at all.

146
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:54,669
I'm a teacher.

147
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:56,540
Spanish teacher.

148
00:14:58,429 --> 00:14:59,869
So, what's the forfeit?

149
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:02,936
You must come to the
next meeting Thursday.

150
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,063
Ah.

151
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:12,652
It's a strong sentence,
but we have to compromise.

152
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,467
We're talking about people who
never speak about themselves.

153
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:19,076
There's no union for prisoners,

154
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,479
so if we don't represent them

155
00:15:21,598 --> 00:15:23,296
there's no point.

156
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,500
You know how feeble
bourgeois journalists are.

157
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:27,594
Le Monde won't accept it.

158
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:31,157
If we don't stir up a hornets' nest...

159
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:34,477
How many articles about
French prisons are there?

160
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:36,068
- Zero.
- We'll be the first ones,

161
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,254
and it'll be shot down. It's stupid.

162
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:42,707
We're not gonna censure
ourselves until Fauvert does it.

163
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:45,670
What's our goal here? To publish a good
article, or to be published in Le Monde?

164
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:47,968
Being published in Le Monde
would gives it importance.

165
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:51,393
We have something to say, we worked for
a year, and in order to be published,

166
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:53,374
we're gonna write what they want to read?

167
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,360
If it's just a reported speech,
it's pointless. It's demagogic!

168
00:15:57,696 --> 00:15:59,753
Demagogic? Really?

169
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:02,194
Of course it is.

170
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:06,691
Prison creates new criminals.
That's what we think.

171
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,693
Can you take my blue dress too?

172
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,350
Put it aside though, so I don't have
to search for hours in your mess.

173
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,499
I know, I need to clean up.

174
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:17,899
- I don't have enough time.
- Oh, yeah, it's hard to do everything,

175
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:21,540
free your sisters from the male
superiority and clean your clothes.

176
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:23,860
Yeah.

177
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,582
What would I do without you?

178
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,238
Women can't live without men.

179
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,999
Chauvinist.

180
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,999
- Shrew.
- Boor.

181
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,524
- Virago.
- Supporter of slavery.

182
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:42,180
Suffragette.

183
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:45,504
- Pompidou's voter.
- Ah, no, no.

184
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,270
- No names!
- You didn't answer so you lost.

185
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,317
No, no, no, you're
cheating. You're cheating!

186
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:53,795
- A punishment for you!
- Go ahead.

187
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:00,546
I won, I won.

188
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:19,560
Hey.

189
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,455
Delphine, you're here.

190
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:23,675
You missed a lot.

191
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:26,257
We laughed so much at Ménie Grégoire.

192
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,047
Everyone went on the set.
People were screaming,

193
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:30,977
- "Liberty! Liberty!"
- Ah, Delphine.

194
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:32,339
Hey.

195
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,858
- How are you?
- I'm good, you?

196
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:37,720
I'm telling her about Ménie Grégoire.

197
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:40,105
Oh la la, it was something!

198
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:44,412
I thought she'd faint.

199
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:51,974
Wanna try?

200
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:54,243
The magazine really
doesn't stick its neck out.

201
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:56,936
They say: "The 343 sluts:

202
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:59,180
it's either courage or exhibitionism."

203
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,962
Of course. Like their
article is courageous.

204
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,912
It's OK.

205
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,539
- Sorry.
- It's OK. It's OK.

206
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:09,634
"We're calling on our sisters:

207
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,373
Let's demand, hand in
hand, appropriate wages,

208
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,916
on par with the work
produced, and equal to men;

209
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:16,937
that women stop being treated as objects.

210
00:18:16,946 --> 00:18:19,480
Meeting in Amphitheater B, April 23."

211
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,192
How are we doing with the banners?

212
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:25,035
On the fourth.

213
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,886
We need more, right?

214
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:30,056
- Maybe one.
- Yeah, it'll be better.

215
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,031
♪ This is the final orgasm ♪

216
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,911
♪ Let us sleep, and tomorrow ♪

217
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:43,333
♪ Dykes and queers ♪

218
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:46,943
♪ Will be the human race ♪

219
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,287
- You OK?
- Yeah.

220
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:02,362
You're on the pill?

221
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,971
No.

222
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:05,758
Why? Are you crazy?

223
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,152
You have to. I keep
saying so to my students.

224
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:10,612
Discreetly though, I
don't want to get fired.

225
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,053
Why don't you take it? You
think it's too expensive?

226
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,944
- No, that's not it.
- My duty as a doctor,

227
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:18,458
is to do everything possible
to help a human life.

228
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:20,142
Whoever he is,

229
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:23,088
regardless of race,

230
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,670
sex, religion... and if we
don't make any distinction

231
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:28,623
based on race, religion or sex,

232
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,925
why should we make one based on age?

233
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,600
What if one day we say that our seniors

234
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:40,350
aren't humans, so we can simply kill them.

235
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:44,680
No, no. Medicine isn't
on the side of death.

236
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:46,925
It's on the side of life.

237
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:50,983
So when women have the
chance to be with child,

238
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:54,359
but still want to abort,

239
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:57,124
I want to tell them:

240
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,379
"Be responsible. When you drive a car,

241
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,168
you respect the traffic laws.

242
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,954
Well, pregnant women and
their little passenger,

243
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:07,675
it's life. It's a child to be born."

244
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:10,995
- My body is not a car!
- Here, a human life!

245
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:13,472
What's going on?

246
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,026
- Enough!
- Your mother should have done

247
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,363
- everyone a favor and abort!
- Asshole!

248
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:25,301
Fascist!

249
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,756
Stick it!

250
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,362
What are you doing?

251
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:51,167
Hurry up!

252
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,074
- For a free abortion law.
- Just don't fuck.

253
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:09,010
- You didn't fuck?
- Of course, but I was careful.

254
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,790
- How?
- We managed.

255
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:15,556
"Dear Antoine. Paris really
is an incredible city."

256
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:19,248
"Even though I hadn't realized it
before. Every day is different."

257
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:21,868
So much is happening here.

258
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:25,207
"I met a great girl."

259
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,124
"A great girl."

260
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,790
"An amazing girl."

261
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,082
"A fantastic girl."

262
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,625
"Her name's Carole."

263
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:41,965
Sorry, I probably got the wrong door.

264
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:44,667
- You're here for the meeting?
- Yes.

265
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:47,109
It's the right door. Come in.

266
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:49,671
- Get out!
- I'm being kicked out of my own place now.

267
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,185
We don't need you anymore.

268
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:53,243
- See ya.
- See ya.

269
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:55,310
- You good?
- Yeah.

270
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:58,208
- Isn't this Carole's?
- It is.

271
00:21:58,328 --> 00:22:01,210
Carole and Manuel's. The boudoir.

272
00:22:03,595 --> 00:22:06,344
He's not crazy at all. He is
a specialist in literature,

273
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:08,223
he is super smart, very funny.

274
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:10,755
But he's queer. So his fucking parents

275
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,438
put him in a mental institution
to cure him. Long live family.

276
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:15,180
Adeline, for us it's a no,

277
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,153
we don't deal with such cases, that's all.

278
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,078
We have to stay on point:
abortion, contraception,

279
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:21,929
otherwise we're gonna divide ourselves.

280
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,040
So I should leave my best friend there

281
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,999
enduring electroshocks,
and maybe a lobotomy,

282
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:31,654
just because it's not what we
fight for, and it's too far away?

283
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:33,477
That's not what we said.

284
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,499
Wait, it's legal to do that to someone?

285
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:38,621
Yes it's legal, and that's the problem.

286
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,099
Put a queer in a mental
institution is legal.

287
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,615
So, what's your plan?

288
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:46,345
My plan's easy. We go
there and we grab him.

289
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:49,525
I'm sorry, Adeline, but it's not our
business to handle men's problems.

290
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,844
We're not gonna start messing
with minority groups' struggles.

291
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:54,458
Minority? You've got a nerve to say that.

292
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:58,642
I fight for the pill, but it's not my
girlfriend's who's gonna knock me up.

293
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:05,253
- I'm really disappointed in you guys.
- Don't take it personally.

294
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:08,760
We pick the fights, we have to be
coherent. We can't disperse like that.

295
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:11,337
It doesn't have to be done
under the Women's Lib's flag.

296
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,672
- Obviously.
- Well, that's it then.

297
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:16,945
I don't get it. Adeline is
always the first to support you,

298
00:23:16,983 --> 00:23:19,846
she always sticks with you no matter what,

299
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:22,425
she was there for Chambart, and
you can't even be there for her?

300
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,857
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

301
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:27,665
It's her best friend, seriously.

302
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:31,038
- Carole, come on, you're coming?
- I don't know.

303
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,395
What? Do you need your
boyfriend's approval?

304
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:36,499
What's up with you?

305
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:39,877
- You don't go, but I will.
- It's stupid.

306
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,974
One group goes to Plessis-Robinson,

307
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:46,749
the other one goes to grab your friend.

308
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:49,023
Why did you change your mind?

309
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:52,005
I'm going to be there for my friend.

310
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,615
That's a very good reason.

311
00:23:55,831 --> 00:23:58,665
So, you go this way.

312
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:02,207
- And the second right...
- On the map, we're there.

313
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:05,172
But I was thinking about
taking this blue path.

314
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,407
- No, you can't. That's a stream.
- Ah.

315
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:11,545
Maybe if you row, but
otherwise, I don't think so.

316
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:14,373
I'm sorry, my husband always
says I can't read a map.

317
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,919
- Yes.
- We're gonna make it.

318
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:19,977
We're here, and the castle's there.

319
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:23,830
- No, madam, look.
- Where are we? We're here, right?

320
00:24:23,874 --> 00:24:25,569
Not at all, Mrs.

321
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,332
Give me your hand.

322
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,795
Hey!

323
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:40,734
- Stop!
- Go, go, go!

324
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,373
Where are you going?

325
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:15,458
I can't open my eyes anymore.

326
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:34,998
- Hello, auntie.
- Hello, sweetie.

327
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,676
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

328
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,831
- I'm happy to see you.
- Me too.

329
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:43,742
- This is my aunt: Hélène.
- Hello, ma'am.

330
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:46,603
- What's going on?
- Just a little accident.

331
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,052
Nothing serious.

332
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:51,850
- Are you sure?
- We made a crazy turn.

333
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:55,928
- You want anything to drink?
- Oh, yes, please, good idea.

334
00:26:58,537 --> 00:27:00,415
You OK, Guitou?

335
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:05,046
He's coming back.

336
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,767
Here we are.

337
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,415
Here.

338
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:28,312
I've never been in the south before.

339
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:37,332
It's weird.

340
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,515
Don't drag too much.

341
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:44,207
No, not that, the landscape.

342
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,724
It's different back home.

343
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:50,464
It always feels like the soil is drenched.

344
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,661
Here when you walk,

345
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:55,746
the soil is hard.

346
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:58,365
Your foot bounces back,
it gives you momentum.

347
00:28:00,488 --> 00:28:02,545
Back home, even in the summer,

348
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:05,248
your foot sinks in.

349
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:07,267
As if the soil was going to swallow it.

350
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,464
As if you have to fight just to walk.

351
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:13,457
You know what I mean?

352
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:15,998
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

353
00:28:24,915 --> 00:28:27,063
We're out of sleeping bags.

354
00:28:39,948 --> 00:28:41,855
I never fought with a man,

355
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:43,950
it's always with women back at the dojo.

356
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:45,334
Cheers.

357
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,545
In the country, it's
like an unwritten law.

358
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:49,925
- Here, taste this.
- Thank you.

359
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,077
For example, my mother
doesn't have a salary,

360
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:55,593
no social security, no checkbook.

361
00:28:55,712 --> 00:28:57,743
But she works all day long.

362
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:00,661
And when a decision must
be made about the farm,

363
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:04,093
- she doesn't have a say.
- It's crazy.

364
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,888
Shift your weight back, push him forward,

365
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:08,319
you pin him and you do an armlock.

366
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:10,414
- Oh.
- Do that really fast.

367
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:13,165
If you do that, he can't move.

368
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,859
Why didn't you say something
during the meetings?

369
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:18,999
I thought no one would be
interested to hear about it.

370
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,446
Are you kidding? Everyone would
have loved to hear about it.

371
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:23,890
That's exactly against such
things we're fighting for.

372
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:25,706
- Adeline.
- No, wait, wait.

373
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,294
- I'm embarrassed.
- Why?

374
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:29,706
Thanks.

375
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:32,475
I don't want to talk about
it in front of everyone.

376
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:43,582
Can I sleep in your bed?

377
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,022
Adeline snores like a trooper.

378
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:47,505
Sure.

379
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:56,582
Thanks.

380
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,633
What?

381
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,681
The situation at the farm can't
keep going. You need to take it back.

382
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,358
You need to do

383
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:20,248
a farmers collective or
something. Something unique.

384
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:24,371
- Did you smoke again?
- Barely.

385
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:26,956
What?

386
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:31,673
I never said I wanted to
kick my dad out of the farm.

387
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,311
You're a chicken.

388
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,499
- No.
- Yes, like most women.

389
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:39,426
Men still have a bright future.

390
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:59,231
What are you doing?

391
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:04,430
Go away, Carole. Go sleep elsewhere.

392
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,123
It's OK, it's no big deal.

393
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,165
- We drank too much.
- No, you drank too much.

394
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,998
Go away, Carole!

395
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:54,046
"I was sixteen and a half.

396
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,581
I was in a coed high school.

397
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:59,312
I was sick, and I didn't have
my period, so a friend told me:

398
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:02,355
'You're pregnant.' She gave me
the address of a doctor in Pigalle.

399
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:05,914
The first time I went to see him,
he was on a first name basis with me.

400
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,165
He told me, 'You're one month pregnant.'

401
00:32:08,285 --> 00:32:10,323
I was panicked and completely disoriented.

402
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,998
He asked me: 'What are you
gonna do?' I had no idea.

403
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:15,635
I didn't want to get married.

404
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:17,818
I didn't have a boyfriend.
The father was in La Rochelle,

405
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,974
I had no way to reach him... "

406
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:37,128
Hello.

407
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:38,886
Hey.

408
00:32:40,188 --> 00:32:42,244
You weren't at the meeting yesterday.

409
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,812
No, I didn't feel like it.

410
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:51,349
Look, I wanted to tell
you about last time,

411
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,303
I'm not shocked, not at all.

412
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,706
I...

413
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:57,946
I was just taken aback.

414
00:32:58,499 --> 00:32:59,706
But...

415
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:01,207
I mean...

416
00:33:01,223 --> 00:33:03,430
I have lesbian friends,

417
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:05,771
but I'm not, that's all.

418
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:08,346
Me neither.

419
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:37,757
I'm taking the banners.

420
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:40,171
- Well, you're pretty late.
- Yeah, yeah, don't tell me off.

421
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:42,172
I don't. Take the banners instead.

422
00:35:42,671 --> 00:35:43,889
You OK?

423
00:35:45,004 --> 00:35:46,212
Yeah, I'm fine.

424
00:35:50,287 --> 00:35:52,471
We can make the first trip.

425
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,991
Put everything in the car.

426
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:12,052
We need to be first in the rally.

427
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,971
Who's taking that?

428
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:36,331
Delphine.

429
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:39,581
Let's go to your place.

430
00:37:13,655 --> 00:37:15,949
What the hell are you talking about?

431
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:19,280
Is it to prove to yourself
you're a free woman?

432
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,846
I'm not trying to prove anything.

433
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:24,421
I didn't wake up one morning thinking

434
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,509
"Oh, today I'm sleeping with a girl."

435
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,004
It happened, that's all.

436
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:33,905
I thought it'd only be a one-time thing.

437
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:37,410
- But it's lasting, and...
- What? You want to break up?

438
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,878
No, otherwise I wouldn't
tell you about it.

439
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,469
Is it just a sex thing or are you in love?

440
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:48,426
I don't know, Manuel.

441
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:50,207
I don't know.

442
00:38:24,483 --> 00:38:25,957
Are you seeing her today?

443
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:28,314
I don't know.

444
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:31,414
You're lying.

445
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:32,972
I know you.

446
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:35,895
You dislike lying so much, when
you have, you become all yellow.

447
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:37,935
I swear.

448
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:43,297
It's not a sure thing, but
we might see each other.

449
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:45,239
OK.

450
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:48,533
Find a place to spend the night then.

451
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:52,272
You're not coming in our
bed after you fucked her.

452
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:45,277
No!

453
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:53,803
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

454
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,922
Bad girl.

455
00:39:57,418 --> 00:39:58,539
Shh.

456
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,428
Oh, come on.

457
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:13,881
Down with the bourgeoise society!

458
00:40:31,126 --> 00:40:32,349
Te quiero.

459
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:34,748
- Te quiero.
- Te quiero?

460
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:35,982
Mi amor.

461
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:38,119
Mi amor.

462
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,176
Me gustan tus pechos.

463
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:42,724
- What does it mean?
- Repeat it.

464
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:44,961
- Me gustan...
- Tus pechos.

465
00:40:44,997 --> 00:40:46,789
- Tus pechos.
- Good.

466
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:48,734
Me gustan... what does it mean.

467
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,337
Nothing.

468
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:54,273
- That's the "pechos"?
- Yes!

469
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:57,155
Ah, the pechos. Yeah,
me gustan tus pechos.

470
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,100
You've got it, my love!

471
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:26,031
Hey.

472
00:42:20,884 --> 00:42:23,914
Hello. Miss Vinatier?

473
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,631
- Yes.
- I have a telegram for you.

474
00:42:52,745 --> 00:42:54,258
I don't get it.

475
00:42:54,294 --> 00:42:56,284
If he was tired, why didn't he stop?

476
00:42:56,717 --> 00:42:59,328
He didn't look tired, he was like usual.

477
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,265
I didn't see it coming.

478
00:43:02,385 --> 00:43:05,318
Just the day before,
he was running around.

479
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:07,289
You know how he is.

480
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:12,740
Then, yesterday morning,
he was loading some cans,

481
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,498
and I saw him fall on the ground.

482
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,420
The doctors told me,

483
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,410
there's no warning signs
for that type of thing.

484
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:27,652
We're lucky he's still here.

485
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:32,570
Does it look like we're lucky?

486
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:44,109
It's hard for me too.

487
00:43:46,846 --> 00:43:48,050
I...

488
00:43:48,957 --> 00:43:51,415
I thought about it, and
I don't have a choice.

489
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:54,265
I don't have a brother,

490
00:43:54,385 --> 00:43:57,130
an uncle or a cousin. If I
don't do it, no one else will.

491
00:43:57,948 --> 00:44:00,660
Are you crazy? You can't cut
yourself off again out there.

492
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:03,269
It's too much for my mom!

493
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,820
And we can't afford a farm hand.

494
00:44:07,876 --> 00:44:09,952
We're just starting something you and I...

495
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,811
You can't tell me that over the phone
like that, Delphine. We need to meet.

496
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,363
I'm on my way. Where are you?

497
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:20,885
Not now, Carole.

498
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:38,862
It's OK.

499
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:41,989
I'm sure she's gonna come back.

500
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:44,174
She loves you, it's obvious.

501
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:47,851
What's going on?

502
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,127
I waited here, because
she's not feeling well.

503
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,386
Did you know the Liéjard brothers
are ready to buy your farm?

504
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,426
Your father had been at the
hospital for less than a day,

505
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,449
and they were already talking
about it to your mother.

506
00:45:47,474 --> 00:45:48,994
Bunch of jerks.

507
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:51,956
She didn't even tell him. In their dreams!

508
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:00,358
You changed.

509
00:46:01,432 --> 00:46:02,743
I did?

510
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:05,128
Yeah, I don't know.

511
00:46:05,308 --> 00:46:07,017
You look less childish, more woman.

512
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:09,496
Or maybe more Parisian.

513
00:46:10,257 --> 00:46:12,270
That's funny. In Paris, I
always felt like a ninny,

514
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,417
and you tell me I look more Parisian.

515
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:20,714
You know,

516
00:46:21,074 --> 00:46:23,171
I'm really sorry about Maurice.

517
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:27,696
But I'm really happy you're here.

518
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:44,968
Stop going through your father's
things, he doesn't like it.

519
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:47,164
I have a meeting with the bank.

520
00:46:47,165 --> 00:46:48,364
Why?

521
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,783
To pay the share.

522
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:53,238
Do you have a health insurance policy?

523
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:56,086
No. We're not gonna pay two of them.

524
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:58,641
We're not as rich as the Giscards.

525
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:04,187
Seven letters.

526
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:07,246
- How many letters?
- We're going to have to shell out.

527
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:28,522
Guys, regarding the purchase
of the agricultural equipment:

528
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:32,055
we're only getting a combine harvester,

529
00:47:32,056 --> 00:47:33,535
- every agrees?
- Yes.

530
00:47:33,856 --> 00:47:36,514
I think it's too expensive.

531
00:47:36,516 --> 00:47:39,189
We should renegotiate the price.

532
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,449
- You're getting cold feet again?
- No, I'm not!

533
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,389
But we're not as rich as Croesus.

534
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,165
Once we've settled on the model we want,

535
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:48,084
we'll calculate everybody's share,

536
00:47:48,085 --> 00:47:49,764
and we'll get your checks.

537
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:52,518
- I'll come pick everyone's check...
- Yeah, Antoine will pick them up.

538
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:55,830
- OK for everyone?
- About Maurice, what do we do?

539
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,157
I'll pay our share.

540
00:47:57,619 --> 00:47:59,894
So, if you pay the share,

541
00:47:59,895 --> 00:48:01,881
I'll have to schedule a
bank appointment for you.

542
00:48:01,886 --> 00:48:03,505
No, that's fine. I have an
appointment early next week.

543
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,033
You took an appointment on your own?

544
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:06,696
Well, yeah.

545
00:48:06,697 --> 00:48:09,595
It's my role as president of the
cooperative so you should have told me,

546
00:48:09,617 --> 00:48:11,462
and we would have come with you.
You would have been more credible.

547
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:14,555
I thought it would be faster that way.

548
00:48:14,747 --> 00:48:16,847
Maybe, but that's not how we do it.

549
00:48:16,848 --> 00:48:18,257
It's not correct.

550
00:48:18,258 --> 00:48:21,573
Well, if the appointment
is scheduled, we'll see...

551
00:48:21,574 --> 00:48:24,464
- So...
- We need to appoint drivers too.

552
00:48:31,747 --> 00:48:33,545
Your father woke up!

553
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,111
- What?
- Your father woke up!

554
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:40,101
They say he's still weak,

555
00:48:40,298 --> 00:48:43,729
but he's conscious. He doesn't
speak but he can understand.

556
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:54,645
Don't take that many, you're
only leaving for a few days.

557
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:56,287
He loves the wild boar one.

558
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,263
You know he's a big eater.

559
00:48:59,622 --> 00:49:03,271
Ouch. We look like two
little girls running around.

560
00:49:21,779 --> 00:49:23,815
Kiss him hello for me.

561
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:29,808
- If you have a problem, call Antoine.
- Yeah, don't worry.

562
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:33,255
Kiss him for me!

563
00:50:03,255 --> 00:50:05,822
You said working the
land was non-stop work,

564
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:07,884
but it feels OK to me.

565
00:50:08,362 --> 00:50:12,372
That's because I woke up at 4:00 am
to do everything before you arrive.

566
00:50:12,414 --> 00:50:15,153
Really? You must be exhausted.

567
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:17,900
No, I'm OK. I still have energy.

568
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:20,372
What kind of energy?

569
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:25,371
Come on, go, go, go!

570
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,616
Go, go, go!

571
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,830
Come on, Laura!

572
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,749
Stop! Stop!

573
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:38,206
Come on, Margot!

574
00:51:43,784 --> 00:51:45,763
What's missing... ah, the jug of water.

575
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:22,387
When I was a kid, we'd play house,

576
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:26,017
and I didn't feel anything
when I kissed boys.

577
00:52:26,296 --> 00:52:29,547
One day, there weren't enough
boys, so I played the dad.

578
00:52:30,603 --> 00:52:33,206
I kissed a girl and it
really made an impression.

579
00:52:33,494 --> 00:52:35,371
And then?

580
00:52:37,252 --> 00:52:39,830
Then I slept with a
girl for the first time.

581
00:52:39,997 --> 00:52:41,747
How old were you?

582
00:52:43,277 --> 00:52:45,430
I was 16 and she was 22.

583
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:47,538
Was she from around here?

584
00:52:48,484 --> 00:52:50,971
No, a city girl, like you.

585
00:52:52,356 --> 00:52:55,080
She was on holidays near our place.

586
00:52:55,446 --> 00:52:58,464
My parents were completely
in the dark. They were happy

587
00:52:58,584 --> 00:53:01,122
that I made friends with a
college girl, from Limoges.

588
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,455
And then?

589
00:53:03,905 --> 00:53:05,288
What "then"?

590
00:53:05,455 --> 00:53:08,702
Don't make me believe there was no
one between your 16 years old and now.

591
00:53:10,551 --> 00:53:13,559
I had a heartache with a girl from here.

592
00:53:15,747 --> 00:53:17,900
And then I met you.

593
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:01,581
I knew it.

594
00:54:02,896 --> 00:54:05,250
I knew it, but I couldn't
believe you'd do that.

595
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,895
You're pathetic.

596
00:54:08,214 --> 00:54:10,407
You say you're confused,
that you don't wanna break up,

597
00:54:10,418 --> 00:54:13,323
and ten days later you go join her for
the weekend, without even warning me.

598
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,080
You must be joking.

599
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:18,330
Are you waiting for my approval?

600
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:23,511
You have no self-discipline, Carole.

601
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:25,917
None.

602
00:54:29,427 --> 00:54:32,225
Commitment is not just in the
amphitheater with your friends.

603
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:36,480
It's in your life too.

604
00:54:56,156 --> 00:54:57,714
- Hello.
- Hello.

605
00:55:00,984 --> 00:55:02,812
Let's get him out.

606
00:55:20,268 --> 00:55:21,914
Help me.

607
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:26,835
Give me his bathrobe.

608
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:42,408
Thank you.

609
00:55:43,137 --> 00:55:44,777
No need to thank me.

610
00:55:51,135 --> 00:55:53,432
Are you certain of what you're doing?

611
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:57,152
I just left her and I already miss her.

612
00:55:58,061 --> 00:56:00,322
I really miss her, you know?

613
00:56:00,997 --> 00:56:04,114
I never felt this way
before. So I'm going back,

614
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:06,447
I don't have a choice.

615
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:10,058
I never wanted for you to miss me.

616
00:56:11,393 --> 00:56:13,806
What I loved about you is
that you didn't need me,

617
00:56:13,842 --> 00:56:15,995
that you were free, and strong.

618
00:56:16,616 --> 00:56:18,498
So what are you saying now?

619
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:22,297
That love, for you, is not being
able to stay apart from someone?

620
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:25,678
Chasing someone, tongue
rolling out, like in cartoons?

621
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:30,721
- That's not you, Carole.
- Maybe.

622
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:33,954
I don't know anymore,

623
00:56:33,981 --> 00:56:35,917
I just let myself drift
away by my feelings.

624
00:56:35,917 --> 00:56:38,096
I don't want to debate about this.

625
00:56:38,637 --> 00:56:40,647
You don't have to stop thinking either.

626
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,147
Mom?

627
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:57,080
A friend from Paris will come visit
us for a few days, if you don't mind.

628
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,954
I don't. Quite the opposite actually.

629
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:04,914
It's good for you, it'll
take your mind off things.

630
00:57:05,866 --> 00:57:09,196
Between handling the farm and your
father, you deserve some entertainment.

631
00:57:11,448 --> 00:57:13,026
Is she a colleague of yours?

632
00:57:14,106 --> 00:57:15,382
Yeah.

633
00:57:16,427 --> 00:57:18,851
She just left her boyfriend,
so she needs to take a break.

634
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:20,772
- Do they have kids?
- No.

635
00:57:20,967 --> 00:57:22,624
Oh, it's easier then.

636
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:24,663
She'll take Grandma's bedroom.

637
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,682
It's the most comfortable one.

638
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:08,288
Oh my god!

639
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:12,059
I gotta warn you, we won't
sleep in the same room.

640
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:13,313
Why?

641
00:58:13,441 --> 00:58:15,215
My dad just had a heart
attack a month ago,

642
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:17,487
I don't want my mom to have one as well.

643
00:58:18,854 --> 00:58:20,996
We're gonna take it easy, OK?

644
00:58:23,473 --> 00:58:24,830
OK.

645
00:58:31,485 --> 00:58:32,747
Dad.

646
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:43,404
This is Carole, she came to see me.

647
00:58:43,671 --> 00:58:45,330
Hello, sir.

648
00:58:47,908 --> 00:58:49,415
Delphine told me a lot about you,

649
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:51,216
I'm really glad to meet you.

650
00:58:56,844 --> 00:58:58,263
See you later.

651
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,310
What kind of work do
you do at Félix Potin?

652
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:27,661
Oh, but I don't work at Félix Potin at all.

653
00:59:28,136 --> 00:59:29,549
Well, I thought...

654
00:59:29,592 --> 00:59:31,235
I'm a Spanish teacher.

655
00:59:31,242 --> 00:59:33,058
We met at a women's group.

656
00:59:33,715 --> 00:59:35,329
What kind of group?

657
00:59:35,581 --> 00:59:38,089
Uh, a pottery group, just for women.

658
00:59:38,796 --> 00:59:41,816
They're workshops around the material.

659
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:46,001
We work on the feelings,

660
00:59:46,189 --> 00:59:48,206
we sculpt, we knead.

661
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:50,163
We work with clay.

662
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,867
It's pleasurable, and very relaxing.

663
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:54,498
You do that kind of thing?

664
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,497
Oh yeah, and she's very gifted.

665
00:59:56,515 --> 00:59:59,728
She makes cute little vases, you'll see.

666
01:00:00,282 --> 01:00:02,038
- Right, Delphine?
- Hmm.

667
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:10,421
Is that dessert? Can I?

668
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:13,662
- I'm gonna get you a plate.
- Oh no, don't bother.

669
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:37,920
Shh.

670
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:28,580
- Up already?
- Yeah.

671
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:30,811
- You didn't sleep well?
- I did, but I'm coming with you.

672
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,427
- We're gonna go work.
- I know.

673
01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:37,491
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes.

674
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:41,620
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

675
01:02:45,164 --> 01:02:46,497
Thank you.

676
01:03:24,608 --> 01:03:27,122
That's no work for a teacher.

677
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:29,133
Oh, am I too slow?

678
01:03:29,162 --> 01:03:31,708
No, no. It's just that if I
didn't have to do it, I wouldn't.

679
01:03:31,828 --> 01:03:32,871
Really?

680
01:03:33,563 --> 01:03:36,122
- But you're proud of what you do?
- Proud? No.

681
01:03:36,242 --> 01:03:37,434
Why would I be?

682
01:03:37,466 --> 01:03:40,942
You and your daughter manage to keep
the farm running, that's not nothing.

683
01:03:42,564 --> 01:03:44,988
It's the proof that a farm
can be managed by women.

684
01:03:45,246 --> 01:03:48,519
It's true that women are
as good as men for work,

685
01:03:49,366 --> 01:03:51,233
but that's not how it's done.

686
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:56,318
- What?
- Nothing.

687
01:03:57,418 --> 01:03:58,455
Here.

688
01:03:58,461 --> 01:04:00,450
It's easier with a man, don't you agree?

689
01:04:00,508 --> 01:04:02,058
I didn't say anything.

690
01:04:07,978 --> 01:04:09,747
What do you have against men?

691
01:04:11,903 --> 01:04:12,762
What?

692
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,287
- What?
- Nothing...

693
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:19,472
What you do is marvelous.

694
01:04:21,812 --> 01:04:23,888
You should be proud, Monique.

695
01:04:32,712 --> 01:04:33,709
Got it.

696
01:04:53,804 --> 01:04:54,957
Look.

697
01:04:56,923 --> 01:04:58,035
Touch it.

698
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:28,416

I didn't even touch you yet.

715
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:05,462
- Did you feel it?
- No.

716
01:07:05,496 --> 01:07:07,012
You see.

717
01:07:10,496 --> 01:07:12,613
- And now?
- No.

718
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:06,365
- Did you tell him we made hay?
- He doesn't understand what we say.

719
01:08:07,621 --> 01:08:10,363
Of course he does. Right, Dad?

720
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:13,984
We made hay.

721
01:08:15,011 --> 01:08:17,875
We have to talk to him.
That's what keeps him alive.

722
01:08:18,412 --> 01:08:21,012
You can bury your head in
the sand. I see what I see.

723
01:08:35,537 --> 01:08:37,647
Sorry. Here.

724
01:09:00,389 --> 01:09:01,913
Do it!

725
01:09:07,662 --> 01:09:09,574
Come on, Delphine!

726
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:22,240
- To Delphine being back, and welcome to...
- Carole.

727
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:25,035
I'm Josette. To Carole and Delphine.

728
01:09:25,155 --> 01:09:26,579
Cheers.

729
01:09:26,591 --> 01:09:28,709
- So, was it good in Paris?
- Yeah.

730
01:09:28,724 --> 01:09:31,425
- I did unexpected things.
- Like what?

731
01:09:31,545 --> 01:09:32,869
Politics.

732
01:09:32,989 --> 01:09:34,446
Politics?

733
01:09:34,627 --> 01:09:36,305
You're gonna do a kolkhoz?

734
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,243
Maybe not a cooperative, but making sure

735
01:09:38,244 --> 01:09:40,957
women get a salary for the work
they do would be a great start.

736
01:09:40,987 --> 01:09:43,575
I do have a salary. My husband's salary.

737
01:09:44,412 --> 01:09:46,935
It's already nice that
she can dip into it, no?

738
01:09:47,621 --> 01:09:49,411
Yes.

739
01:10:02,373 --> 01:10:04,121
It seems nice.

740
01:10:05,408 --> 01:10:07,228
Do you want a drink?

741
01:10:07,348 --> 01:10:09,840
No, thanks. I can't right now.

742
01:10:10,362 --> 01:10:13,074
Well, I feel like drinking tonight.

743
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,550
It's well deserved, look.

744
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:18,190
Practice makes perfect.

745
01:10:18,496 --> 01:10:20,784
How long have you known Delphine?

746
01:10:22,027 --> 01:10:23,621
Since forever.

747
01:10:23,883 --> 01:10:25,999
What was she like as a kid?

748
01:10:26,782 --> 01:10:28,131
Like now.

749
01:10:33,726 --> 01:10:36,167
You know, you can't know
someone in just three months.

750
01:10:39,418 --> 01:10:41,526
Delphine won't leave.

751
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:43,705
Really?

752
01:10:44,642 --> 01:10:46,705
How can you be certain?

753
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,020
Have you seen Maurice?

754
01:10:49,686 --> 01:10:52,947
He'll never be able to handle the farm.

755
01:10:53,307 --> 01:10:56,549
And Delphine would rather
die than sell it. I know that.

01:11:25,012 --> 01:11:27,227
I doubt I'll wake up your dad.

761
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:28,959
Hello!

762
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:30,938
Stop, please.

763
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:33,279
Sorry, we drank a little bit too much.

764
01:11:50,569 --> 01:11:55,235
"Relax, we're gonna work
on our own today. I love you."

765
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:37,120
I can't figure out if Delphine
really likes this life,

766
01:12:37,484 --> 01:12:40,603
or if she can't imagine something else.

767
01:12:41,787 --> 01:12:44,567
I'm sure she could do
a ton of other things.

768
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,510
Your daughter's smart.

769
01:12:48,054 --> 01:12:49,913
But you know that.

770
01:12:50,693 --> 01:12:53,015
She's an egg-head.

771
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,052
You know...

772
01:13:04,376 --> 01:13:06,507
I'm not here to make hay.

773
01:13:06,627 --> 01:13:08,919
Or to be on holidays in the countryside.

774
01:13:08,947 --> 01:13:11,631
I don't care about the countryside at all.

775
01:13:14,695 --> 01:13:16,762
I came here because of your daughter.

776
01:13:18,821 --> 01:13:20,954
Because I love her.

777
01:13:22,294 --> 01:13:24,370
There, I said it.

778
01:13:25,885 --> 01:13:28,120
I'm crazy about her.

779
01:13:28,559 --> 01:13:31,515
I never thought I could
love someone like this.

780
01:13:39,959 --> 01:13:41,954
I've got it.

781
01:14:32,914 --> 01:14:34,592
Delphine.

782
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,204
Don't you miss Paris?

783
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,662
No, not really.

784
01:14:41,302 --> 01:14:44,340
When we met, you seemed to like it.

785
01:14:45,537 --> 01:14:47,876
That's because you were there.

786
01:14:47,995 --> 01:14:51,078
If you had been on Mars, I
would have liked Mars too.

787
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:53,995
You're a sweet-talker.

788
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:59,066
I didn't think one day, I'd miss Paris.

789
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,078
The smell of fumes.

790
01:15:05,187 --> 01:15:07,000
The car horns.

791
01:15:08,977 --> 01:15:12,269
The coffee I drink at the
bar before going to work.

792
01:15:15,343 --> 01:15:17,193
Sitting between a worker and a boss,

793
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,705
and everyone has the same
status for five minutes.

794
01:15:24,121 --> 01:15:26,352
I even miss the cops.

795
01:15:32,509 --> 01:15:35,819
Oh no, don't throw all
that. You're wasting it.

796
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,329
- Ah, really?
- Yeah, let me do it.

797
01:15:47,994 --> 01:15:49,834
Hello, Monique.

798
01:15:49,953 --> 01:15:52,120
- Hello, Antoine.
- How are you?

799
01:15:52,683 --> 01:15:54,787
- Hi.
- Hello.

800
01:15:58,238 --> 01:15:59,912
If only...

801
01:16:00,078 --> 01:16:02,287
she were to marry him. That'd be nice.

802
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:05,664
Why do you say that?

803
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,844
When she left for Paris, I
thought it would never happen.

804
01:16:09,963 --> 01:16:14,120
I thought Antoine would get
bored. But now that she's back...

805
01:16:14,287 --> 01:16:16,329
I don't see what's stopping them.

806
01:16:17,395 --> 01:16:19,308
Did he ask her?

807
01:16:19,335 --> 01:16:22,591
He's waiting for her.
That's his way of asking her.

808
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:28,621
And are you sure Delphine knows that?

809
01:16:28,829 --> 01:16:30,417
Everybody knows.

810
01:16:30,537 --> 01:16:32,639
And she's got eyes.

811
01:16:54,335 --> 01:16:56,941
Carole, what are you doing? I've
been looking for you everywhere.

812
01:16:56,942 --> 01:17:00,398
Unless I'm abducted by aliens, I
can't see what could happen to me here.

813
01:17:00,904 --> 01:17:03,053
Why are you pissed off?

814
01:17:03,078 --> 01:17:06,282
Do you realize that your mom thinks
you're going to marry Antoine?

815
01:17:06,287 --> 01:17:08,393
Do you realize that?

816
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:12,783
So what. It makes her happy.
She's allowed to dream.

817
01:17:12,786 --> 01:17:14,209
Yeah, right.

818
01:17:14,218 --> 01:17:17,163
You keep her hoping because
it works out well for you.

819
01:17:18,326 --> 01:17:20,587
What do you want me to say
to her? That we're together?

820
01:17:20,588 --> 01:17:23,514
Yeah! You can't lie to her your whole life.

821
01:17:24,621 --> 01:17:26,718
Maybe she'll stop thinking I'm a Parisian

822
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,344
who wants to get back to nature.

823
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:33,873
I can't rush her out of nowhere. She
doesn't even know such things exist.

824
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:36,591
Oh right. Keep thinking
your mom's an idiot.

825
01:17:36,711 --> 01:17:38,295
It's convenient for you.

826
01:17:43,101 --> 01:17:44,531
Carole.

827
01:17:50,237 --> 01:17:51,461
Carole.

828
01:17:53,113 --> 01:17:55,162
Please, open the door.

829
01:17:56,203 --> 01:17:57,691
Carole.

830
01:18:33,582 --> 01:18:34,982
Oh, shut up.

831
01:18:35,352 --> 01:18:36,991
No comments.

832
01:18:37,956 --> 01:18:39,329
What?

833
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:44,390
What are you trying to do exactly?

834
01:18:44,829 --> 01:18:47,037
Your mom asked me to set this up.

835
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,953
You're doing it wrong.

836
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,612
You're good at that.

837
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,565
Monique is fond of you now.

838
01:19:00,774 --> 01:19:02,459
She's always asking you to do things.

839
01:19:02,465 --> 01:19:04,287
Yeah, she likes me.

840
01:19:04,308 --> 01:19:07,493
It's a good thing she doesn't
know all the dirty we're doing.

841
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:14,703
Carole.

842
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,953
- Hello.
- Hello.

843
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,988
He's gonna spread rumors around:

844
01:19:41,995 --> 01:19:45,006
"Maurice's daughter is
a lesbian, hide your... "

845
01:19:45,434 --> 01:19:47,370
Stop, it's not funny.

846
01:19:51,463 --> 01:19:52,912
Delphine.

847
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,828
It's stuck.

848
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,024
I can't put my hand in it.

849
01:21:38,314 --> 01:21:39,974
Ah, that's it, I got it.

850
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:45,968
He's coming, he's coming!

851
01:21:46,377 --> 01:21:48,578
Yes! Yes, come on!

852
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:51,733
- Come on, girl!
- Keep going!

853
01:21:51,778 --> 01:21:53,483
Yeah.

854
01:21:53,602 --> 01:21:55,288
Yes!

855
01:21:59,133 --> 01:22:01,753
Here you go. Your baby.

856
01:22:12,463 --> 01:22:15,020
You scared us, girl.

857
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,405
It was off to a bad start.

858
01:22:17,524 --> 01:22:19,495
Thanks, Antoine.

859
01:22:36,429 --> 01:22:39,281
- A coffee, Antoine?
- Yes, please.

860
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:41,667
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

861
01:23:17,946 --> 01:23:20,132
I can't stand it. I'm going home.

862
01:23:20,757 --> 01:23:22,715
Whatever.

863
01:23:22,835 --> 01:23:24,556
Go back to Manuel too.

864
01:23:24,676 --> 01:23:27,503
I left him for you, remember?

865
01:23:27,984 --> 01:23:30,559
Did you ever wonder if
that wouldn't bother me?

866
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,827
- You turning up like this?
- What?

867
01:23:32,828 --> 01:23:35,801
What was I going to tell my folks,
I'm just supposed to be out and proud?

868
01:23:36,952 --> 01:23:38,766
That's small.

869
01:23:39,292 --> 01:23:41,204
That's very small of you.

870
01:23:41,676 --> 01:23:45,005
I'm not like you. I do
care what people think.

871
01:23:51,923 --> 01:23:54,408
Say you're ashamed of
me while you're at it!

872
01:23:57,971 --> 01:23:59,976
Shit, I...

873
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:03,786
I kept my mouth shut, I
said yes to everything...

874
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:11,151
It's not other people who look at
you. You're monitoring yourself.

875
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:13,554
You're your own guardian.

876
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:16,495
- Your own guardian!
- I can't do everything at once!

877
01:24:17,877 --> 01:24:20,579
I can't manage the farm and be with you!

878
01:24:21,414 --> 01:24:24,778
You keep saying women must be independent.

879
01:24:24,787 --> 01:24:27,380
Well, I fight everyday
so that this farm exists.

880
01:24:28,953 --> 01:24:31,525
- That's concrete!
- Yeah, great! Congrats!

881
01:24:31,562 --> 01:24:33,313
You're a pioneer, good for you!

882
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:35,120
Great!

883
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:39,088
You fight more for your farm than for us!

884
01:24:44,275 --> 01:24:46,532
You're heartless, Delphine.

885
01:24:47,453 --> 01:24:49,840
All I sacrificed for you!

886
01:24:52,262 --> 01:24:54,037
Don't you get it?

887
01:24:55,607 --> 01:24:57,811
I'm here for you!

888
01:25:29,414 --> 01:25:31,763
Delphine, you found your place?

889
01:25:31,883 --> 01:25:33,620
Yeah.

890
01:25:35,826 --> 01:25:37,621
- You good?
- Yeah, you?

891
01:25:37,658 --> 01:25:39,689
Have you seen it?

892
01:26:35,278 --> 01:26:38,361
Where were you? We didn't even toast.

893
01:26:38,769 --> 01:26:41,055
It's a nice machine.

894
01:26:41,526 --> 01:26:43,177
Yeah, it's nice.

895
01:26:45,054 --> 01:26:46,486
Kiss me.

896
01:26:46,486 --> 01:26:48,369
- What?
- Kiss me.

897
01:26:51,393 --> 01:26:53,460
Why do you do that?

898
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,318
You have a finger in every pie?

899
01:26:55,456 --> 01:26:56,494
What?

900
01:26:56,495 --> 01:26:58,953
I saw you with your girl friend.
I know why she's here.

901
01:26:59,226 --> 01:27:01,165
What do you mean, what did you see?

902
01:27:01,166 --> 01:27:03,538
Don't take me for a fool,
it's even worse!

903
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:05,703
Stop.

904
01:27:14,597 --> 01:27:16,162
Antoine.

905
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,565
- Antoine.
- What game are you playing? Huh?

906
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,208
What do you want?

907
01:27:21,328 --> 01:27:23,466
You want me to cover for you?

908
01:27:28,554 --> 01:27:30,404
I won't say a word.

909
01:27:30,524 --> 01:27:33,314
Don't worry about that.
You mean too much for me.

910
01:27:42,075 --> 01:27:44,949
It took you a while to see that machine.

911
01:27:56,338 --> 01:27:58,206
You better?

912
01:27:59,766 --> 01:28:01,806
- Uh?
- Yeah.

913
01:28:06,549 --> 01:28:08,508
My little cowboy.

914
01:28:21,803 --> 01:28:24,795
It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK.

915
01:28:25,484 --> 01:28:27,071
It's OK.

916
01:28:27,098 --> 01:28:29,093
Shh.

917
01:28:38,587 --> 01:28:40,078
Delphine.

918
01:28:41,225 --> 01:28:42,828
Delphine.

919
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:52,495
07:30 am.

920
01:28:55,468 --> 01:28:58,071
- Fuck.
- Well, now she knows.

921
01:28:58,107 --> 01:29:00,021
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

922
01:29:00,618 --> 01:29:03,756
It's not happening. Fuck!

923
01:29:13,545 --> 01:29:15,767
Don't fucking laugh!

924
01:29:43,706 --> 01:29:46,190
You weren't awake, so I did the milking.

925
01:29:48,685 --> 01:29:50,286
Thanks.

926
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,926
I forgot the alarm clock.
It won't happen tomorrow.

927
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:56,286
I hope.

928
01:30:32,847 --> 01:30:35,328
I'm sorry.

929
01:30:39,366 --> 01:30:42,277
- I'm gonna go to the market.
- OK.

930
01:30:42,694 --> 01:30:45,042
That gives you two hours to leave.

931
01:30:46,085 --> 01:30:49,141
When I'm back, it has to be
as if you were never here.

932
01:30:51,381 --> 01:30:53,857
- You think Delphine will be OK with this?
- This is my house!

933
01:30:53,976 --> 01:30:57,339
So I want you to get out, to leave.

934
01:30:57,459 --> 01:30:59,553
- Let's talk about this.
- No.

935
01:30:59,673 --> 01:31:02,745
My daughter's sane. She's a good girl.

936
01:31:02,781 --> 01:31:05,030
You damaged her. You're...

937
01:31:06,236 --> 01:31:07,887
You're nasty.

938
01:31:08,103 --> 01:31:10,044
I'm the same person

939
01:31:10,053 --> 01:31:12,675
you've been working with
all these weeks, Monique.

940
01:31:13,178 --> 01:31:15,718
You didn't think I was nasty back then.

941
01:31:15,755 --> 01:31:18,206
Because I didn't know! You're a liar

942
01:31:18,244 --> 01:31:20,870
- on top of being a pervert!
- Yes, we lied to you.

943
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,176
But Delphine was afraid to hurt you.

944
01:31:23,205 --> 01:31:25,117
And I agreed to lie, because I love her.

945
01:31:25,693 --> 01:31:26,940
Shut up!

946
01:31:27,275 --> 01:31:29,198
Shut up. What are you gonna do now?

947
01:31:29,256 --> 01:31:31,437
You're gonna tell me
the nasty things you did?

948
01:31:31,463 --> 01:31:34,204
All the disgusting
things? I don't wanna know!

949
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:37,832
It's not disgusting! I'm
talking about your daughter!

950
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:40,965
Get out! You're the devil in my house!

951
01:31:40,987 --> 01:31:42,656
Stop! Stop it!

952
01:31:42,982 --> 01:31:46,661
- The devil in my house.
- Stop, Monique.

953
01:31:56,228 --> 01:31:57,870
Delphine!

954
01:32:02,728 --> 01:32:04,549
Delphine! I'm leaving!

955
01:32:04,607 --> 01:32:06,631
I'm catching a train, I can't stay here.

956
01:32:06,935 --> 01:32:08,605
I can't...

957
01:32:10,208 --> 01:32:11,948
She threw me out!

958
01:32:15,728 --> 01:32:16,874
Carole.

959
01:32:20,703 --> 01:32:22,277
If you leave, I leave.

960
01:32:22,669 --> 01:32:26,286
I'm coming with you,
Carole. I'm coming with you!

961
01:32:45,255 --> 01:32:48,273
"Mom, I'm leaving with Carole."

962
01:32:48,911 --> 01:32:52,350
"I was too afraid to tell you about
myself, but I hope one day you'll get it."

963
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:54,552
"Forgive me for hurting you."

964
01:32:56,539 --> 01:32:58,874
"You and Dad will always be in my heart."

965
01:33:00,471 --> 01:33:03,191
"I'm still your daughter. Delphine."

966
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:17,454
Adeline won't believe it.

967
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:20,799
I'll grab my things,
and we'll find a place.

968
01:33:44,644 --> 01:33:47,052
The connection is in 45 minutes.

969
01:33:47,415 --> 01:33:49,388
There's not even a café around.

970
01:33:50,197 --> 01:33:51,916
I'm so hungry.

971
01:33:52,635 --> 01:33:54,478
When we arrive, I'll take
you to the restaurant.

972
01:33:54,688 --> 01:33:56,298
A great one.

973
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:01,071
You're not hungry?

974
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:02,646
Not really.

975
01:34:25,926 --> 01:34:27,632
Carole, I can't.

976
01:34:27,646 --> 01:34:28,952
What?

977
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:31,419
I don't want to hurt you, but I can't.

978
01:34:34,284 --> 01:34:37,302
That's not possible. You can't
change your mind like this...

979
01:34:37,527 --> 01:34:40,703
in an hour, for something this important.

980
01:34:41,597 --> 01:34:44,077
I can't do it. I can't.

981
01:34:50,513 --> 01:34:52,413
Come with me, I'm begging you.

982
01:34:53,791 --> 01:34:55,250
Delphine.

983
01:34:56,614 --> 01:34:58,782
What was the chance for us to meet?

984
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:00,249
One in a million?

985
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:04,042
One in two millions? We were at
the same place at the same time.

986
01:35:04,162 --> 01:35:07,059
If you have gotten in the bus five minutes
earlier, you would have never seen me.

987
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:10,187
We would have never met. It's a sign!

988
01:35:11,311 --> 01:35:13,218
I do believe in signs!

989
01:35:15,483 --> 01:35:17,311
Let's catch this train.

990
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:24,224
- Carole.
- We have to go.

991
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,094
Train's coming.

992
01:35:26,529 --> 01:35:28,597
Let's go. Take your suitcase.

993
01:35:33,086 --> 01:35:34,578
Come on.

994
01:35:35,307 --> 01:35:36,994
Delphine!

995
01:37:20,370 --> 01:37:22,495
You missed your train?

996
01:37:25,348 --> 01:37:27,361
No, I came back.

997
01:37:28,992 --> 01:37:30,328
I'm here.

998
01:37:34,225 --> 01:37:36,036
You're back?

999
01:37:43,302 --> 01:37:44,997
And the other one?

1000
01:37:46,577 --> 01:37:48,652
Carole is back in Paris, she won't return.

1001
01:38:21,932 --> 01:38:23,756
Do your parents know?

1002
01:38:25,877 --> 01:38:28,717
- Are you afraid?
- No.

1003
01:38:39,516 --> 01:38:41,330
Is it gonna hurt?

1004
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:43,785
No, don't worry.

1005
01:38:44,368 --> 01:38:47,315
The doctor is going to
do a suction aspiration.

1006
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:49,667
It's a simple,

1007
01:38:49,702 --> 01:38:52,192
less risky, and painless abortion.

1008
01:38:52,757 --> 01:38:56,349
You're three weeks, so you
came here at the right time.

1009
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:59,040
Is everything clear to you?

1010
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,020
Yes, I think. Thanks.

1011
01:39:01,608 --> 01:39:05,598
Now, did you ever think
about going on the pill?

1012
01:39:05,718 --> 01:39:07,165
I don't know.

1013
01:39:07,209 --> 01:39:09,500
Take a pill every day...

1014
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:13,259
we don't really know what
it does, how it works.

1015
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:15,327
I can explain to you how it works,

1016
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:17,420
that way you'll stop imagining things.

1017
01:39:18,559 --> 01:39:20,431
Are you on the pill?

1018
01:39:20,975 --> 01:39:22,832
No, I'm not.

1019
01:39:22,869 --> 01:39:25,030
Why don't you if it's that good?

1020
01:39:25,762 --> 01:39:29,295
I don't take the pill because
I don't need contraception.

1021
01:39:31,827 --> 01:39:33,633
I'm with a woman.

1022
01:39:35,027 --> 01:39:36,226
You remember Coralie,

1023
01:39:36,227 --> 01:39:38,415
- we saw her three weeks ago?
- Mm-hm.

1024
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,316
- She's staying at my place.
- Ugh.

1025
01:39:40,751 --> 01:39:42,328
Don't "Ugh" me.

1026
01:39:42,494 --> 01:39:47,411
She had nowhere to go, and I didn't
want to send her to some shelter.

1027
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:48,869
Sigrid.

1028
01:39:49,036 --> 01:39:50,645
You're too nice.

1029
01:39:50,765 --> 01:39:52,531
It's a quality too.

1030
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,433
One day, you'll let
people walk all over you.

1031
01:39:55,455 --> 01:39:57,911
It's only the third time.

1032
01:39:58,077 --> 01:40:01,491
But the timing's good, I
was starting to feel lonely.

1033
01:40:01,883 --> 01:40:03,660
You OK?

1034
01:40:05,061 --> 01:40:06,823
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1035
01:40:07,215 --> 01:40:08,724
Excuse me a minute.

1036
01:40:16,755 --> 01:40:18,203
"Dear Carole,

1037
01:40:20,245 --> 01:40:22,434
I hope you get this letter.

1038
01:40:23,603 --> 01:40:26,025
I wanted to tell you that
I left my parents' farm.

1039
01:40:26,519 --> 01:40:29,008
What I couldn't do when
you were there by my side,

1040
01:40:29,045 --> 01:40:31,294
I did it a few years later.

1041
01:40:31,881 --> 01:40:33,745
I thought about you a lot.

1042
01:40:33,803 --> 01:40:36,046
I follow the movement's news.

1043
01:40:36,166 --> 01:40:38,505
I still can't believe
everything you achieved.

1044
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,146
Now I wonder what cause you're fighting,

1045
01:40:41,182 --> 01:40:43,488
who you're living with, what you became.

1046
01:40:43,749 --> 01:40:46,556
I live in the south now.
I've got my own farm.

1047
01:40:46,593 --> 01:40:48,718
It's small but it's mine.

1048
01:40:50,279 --> 01:40:52,223
I wish I could go back in time.

1049
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,559
Go back to that day on the train,

1050
01:40:54,679 --> 01:40:58,473
and have the courage I
lacked back then, but...

1051
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:01,586
that's not possible.

1052
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:04,865
I cried a lot after you left.

1053
01:41:05,656 --> 01:41:07,643
But at least, I understand that

1054
01:41:07,763 --> 01:41:09,798
we can't go back.

1055
01:41:09,918 --> 01:41:11,953
We can only move forward.

1056
01:41:12,244 --> 01:41:14,434
That's what I'm trying to do now.

1057
01:41:22,516 --> 01:41:23,880
Love.

1058
01:41:23,924 --> 01:41:23,880
Delphine."

1058
01:41:24,305 --> 01:42:24,225
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
