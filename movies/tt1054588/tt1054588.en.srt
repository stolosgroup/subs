00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:32,997
<i>On the Maryland Giant,</i>

3
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,632
<i>I'm the Fryman in the morning,</i>
<i>and it's time for sports!</i>

4
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,973
<i>The Orioles continue to shoot
skyward like a Saturn V.</i>

5
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:41,671
<i>Having locked up the</i>
<i>pennant over a week ago,</i>

6
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:44,840
<i>last night in Municipal Stadium
in front of over 19,000.</i>

7
00:00:53,524 --> 00:00:56,507
Excuse me, sir. Can I
speak with one of your passengers?

8
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:58,059
Sure. Go ahead.
Go in back.

9
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:00,359
I'll go back there now.
Thanks.

10
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,259
Robert Kearns?

11
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:10,372
Dr. Kearns?

12
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:12,965
Yes?

13
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:15,911
Sir, your family's very
concerned about you.

14
00:01:18,182 --> 00:01:20,207
Why don't you
come with us?

15
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:23,482
The Vice President asked
me to come to Washington.

16
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:26,857
Yes, sir,
we understand.

17
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,559
You should
come with us.

18
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:35,926
I suppose I could.

19
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:39,194
Hmm.

20
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:46,576
I'll take that
for you.

21
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:48,977
Be careful.

22
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:51,441
That's for my kids.

23
00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:54,610
Don't you worry, sir.
We'll take good care of it.

24
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,821
<i>Scott, you and Louise want to
come to our place for dinner tonight?</i>

25
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:05,260
<i>Well, what
about the Pistons game?</i>

26
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,594
No, I gave my tickets to my kids.

27
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,370
Prices where they are,
you gotta be kidding.

28
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:09,730
Hiya, Bob.

29
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:11,792
Hey.
- How's the teaching going?

30
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,564
Oh, good.

31
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:16,630
How many Kearns kids
are there now? 13?

32
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,767
I can divine it.
- Oh, you can divine it.

33
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:21,744
What Scott here divines is that
the Knicks have two guys out

34
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:23,405
with ankle injuries,
right, Bob?

35
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:25,779
Mmm. You talking
about basketball?

36
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,876
Kearns,
you probably mean that.

37
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:32,048
I do.

38
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:55,103
As I look out over
this sea of familiar faces,

39
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:58,438
I see men from
G.M., A.M.C.,

40
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,408
Ford, Chrysler,
Jeep and Dodge

41
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:04,011
all under one roof,
as it should be.

42
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:06,683
And it brings to
mind the apostles.

43
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:11,525
What was it that brought these
very different men together as one?

44
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:16,595
Father Rooney was good
today, huh? He was funny.

45
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,794
He was great.
He really was.

46
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,894
Can I pinch you?

47
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:21,871
No, dipshit.
- Mom, make him stop calling me...

48
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,099
What did you just say?

49
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:25,642
Dipstick. It's an
automotive term, Mom.

50
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,110
Well, say that one more time and
I will have your chassis waxed.

51
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:30,739
Okay? That's an
automotive term, too.

52
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:33,673
Look at this.

53
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:38,154
I turn this thing off, 10
seconds later, I can't see.

54
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:39,348
I can't see, either.

55
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:41,358
So you turn it back on,

56
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:44,927
and now the
windshield's clean,

57
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:46,429
but the wipers are dragging.

58
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:47,930
You hear that, that screeching?
- Mmm-hmm.

59
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,297
Yeah, I hear it, I hear it.
- Yeah, it's annoying.

60
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:53,337
All right, so it's raining
and I turn it back off.

61
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:55,565
But now I can
barely see.

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,471
I can't... I can't see anything, sweetie.
- I can't, either.

63
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,134
Sweetie, turn them on.
- Right now, I can't see a thing.

64
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,871
If I don't turn this thing on
right now, we'll hit somebody.

65
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:01,934
Turn it on, honey. Please.

66
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:03,275
Look at this!

67
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,041
Okay, that's
not funny at all.

68
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:07,243
Whoa. All right.
All right. All right.

69
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:09,047
Ten thousand engineers
in Detroit,

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,145
you'd think they'd know
how to design an automobile.

71
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,032
What are you doing?

72
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:25,729
Oh, I was thinking
about how eyes work.

73
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:30,232
We blink about every four, six seconds,
and there's this lachrymal fluid and...

74
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:31,570
Really?

75
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,143
Interesting.

76
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:39,943
And what are you
thinking about?

77
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,248
I'm thinking we should
make another kid.

78
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:49,425
Gotcha.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:54,391
Oh, that's good.
You're funny.

80
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,609
I'm gonna be
right back.

81
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,170
Huh? Huh?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:54,955
Spell "giant."

83
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:57,085
G-I...
- G-I-A-N-T. It's so easy.

84
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:59,595
Is your name Kathy? Is it
your test? I don't think so.

85
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:00,892
It's Kathy's test.
Kathy, what's the next one?

86
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:01,989
Puppy.

87
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:04,557
Puppy or science? Puppy's
too easy. Do science.

88
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:07,399
Hi, poop.
- Okay. S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

89
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:09,302
Six minutes, you guys.
Come on, let's really hustle.

90
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,897
S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

91
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:12,465
When is
Calvin's sleepover?

92
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:14,033
Friday. I have to call his mom.
- Can I go...

93
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:15,510
"Police described the
badly decomposed body..."

94
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,138
I don't think so today,
sweetie. I don't know.

95
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,012
"...as one of the most gruesome crimes..."
- What time?

96
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,573
What is that?
- My current event.

97
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,380
I thought we agreed we weren't
doing murders for a while.

98
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:24,011
Mom, what
about after school?

99
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:25,851
Honey, good morning.
- Hey.

100
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,390
You tired?
- No, I'm fine.

101
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,652
What time did
you come to bed?

102
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:31,160
I don't really know.
Are you substituting today?

103
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:33,129
Yeah, fourth
grade. Eat something.

104
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:35,131
No, no. I'll get something
at school. That seems like a lot.

105
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,496
No, they called.
It's at Pat's school,

106
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,864
and so I can pick
them up after anyway.

107
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:39,664
Well, who's gonna watch him?
- And I'm gonna take him to the...

108
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:41,257
Don't worry about it.
Eat something, honey.

109
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:41,637
Okay. Hey.

110
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:42,695
Bye, kids.
All right?

111
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,365
See you, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.

112
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:45,773
Bye, Dad.
- Don't use your wipers today.

113
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:47,037
Bob, what?

114
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:49,045
Yeah, I needed
the motor.

115
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:50,341
Honey, what
if it rains?

116
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:52,507
No, no. It's
not gonna rain.

117
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:07,356
Good morning, everybody.
I want to welcome you all

118
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:11,925
to the first day of the quarter
for Applied Electrical Engineering.

119
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,698
My name is Dr. Robert Kearns

120
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:17,104
and I'd like to start by
talking to you about ethics.

121
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:21,372
I can't think of a job or a career
where the understanding of ethics

122
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,470
is more important
than engineering.

123
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:26,607
Who designed the artificial
aortic heart valve?

124
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:30,983
An engineer did that.

125
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:35,089
And who designed the gas
chambers at Auschwitz?

126
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:39,024
An engineer did that, too.

127
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:43,032
One man was responsible for helping
save tens of thousands of lives,

128
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,864
another man
helped kill millions.

129
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:49,372
Now, I don't know what any of you
are gonna end up doing in your lives,

130
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,739
but I can guarantee you
that there will come a day

131
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,210
where you have
a decision to make,

132
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,717
and it won't be as easy as deciding
between a heart valve and a gas chamber.

133
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:03,219
Everything we do
in this classroom

134
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:07,648
ultimately comes back to
that notion. All right?

135
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,555
Grades count, too.

136
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:26,133
Hi, Jerry.
- Dr. Kearns.

137
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:29,839
I'm gonna make a donut run.
Are you interested?

138
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,481
Mmm, you can't do
it mechanically.

139
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:34,309
Can't do what?

140
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:38,583
That's the pause between wipes.
That was my mistake.

141
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:42,285
Can't do it mechanically. You might
be able to do it electronically.

142
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,329
Oh, probably.
You want a donut?

143
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,229
No, thanks.

144
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,492
Okay.

145
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:58,304
Dennis, stop it.
Timmy! Cut it out. Get over here.

146
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:03,242
Okay, Dennis,
problem again?

147
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:04,975
To make it pause
between sweeps.

148
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,949
Good.
And solution?

149
00:09:07,184 --> 00:09:09,812
Well, I guess we could change the speed.
- Yeah.

150
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,653
Yeah, except it would be the wrong
approach and it wouldn't work.

151
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:14,986
What do I
always say?

152
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,458
"Who farted?"

153
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,017
Besides that.

154
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:20,125
Uh, look for
the unobvious.

155
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:23,291
Yeah. So you do listen.
All right. Well, we're just looking

156
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,595
for a measured,
consistent pause.

157
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:26,260
Like your eye, right there.
See that?

158
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:28,464
The way it blinks
away a tear?

159
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:31,770
And we could try
a bimetallic timer

160
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:34,003
that responds
to heat changes.

161
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:36,876
But then, of course, what
do we do on a cold day?

162
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,414
Put the ball down.
Sit down here.

163
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:40,245
I want you to
put this together.

164
00:09:40,317 --> 00:09:44,014
I want you to solder this, all right?
Dennis, help him out. Get over here.

165
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:47,580
Here we go. Here we go.
We got Team Kearns here!

166
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:51,019
Yeah, this is hot, this is hot.
So, careful, all right?

167
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:54,656
That's got a transistor and a
capacitor, and resistors in there.

168
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:58,566
That's as simple as I can get it.
That's when you get real beauty.

169
00:09:58,636 --> 00:09:59,898
When less is more.

170
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,028
Will it work?

171
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,402
It works up here
perfectly.

172
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:06,068
We got resistors, each one
rated at a different tolerance.

173
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:10,273
And each one should work in a wiper
motor. Where are the meter cords?

174
00:10:10,347 --> 00:10:12,212
Uh, just over there.

175
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:15,582
Of course, there's a thousand
different combinations.

176
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:18,320
Our job is to find
the one that works.

177
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:21,119
And there is one
that'll work in theory.

178
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,424
You know, Marconi spent seven
years trying to perfect the radio.

179
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,129
Timmy, stop with
the ball, please!

180
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:45,074
Well, what do you
know about that?

181
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:47,045
One, two,
three, now!

182
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:49,482
Wow!
- One, two...

183
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:52,283
Honey, it's so great.
It really works.

184
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:54,256
Two, three, now!

185
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:56,088
That's it,
it's going.

186
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,788
It's alive!

187
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:01,257
It moves!

188
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:04,062
It pauses!

189
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:08,195
It's alive!
Alive! Alive! Alive!

190
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:10,035
What do you think?

191
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:12,439
Let's go out and
celebrate in real style.

192
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,102
Really?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:16,438
I'm gonna
buy a diamond ring.

194
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:18,175
Thank you, Peggy.
- You're only six.

195
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,547
You got a little ways to go, sweetie.
- I got the burger, right?

196
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:22,085
Can I have
some more Pepsi?

197
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:23,176
Uh, me, too, please.

198
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:24,414
Sure, if your parents
say it's okay.

199
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:26,922
All right this time.
- Did you get a pickle?

200
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:28,618
You know why I wanted so many kids?

201
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:32,128
Because I had six in my
family and you loved my family?

202
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:34,630
True.
I missed that growing up.

203
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:37,098
I think you're all caught up.

204
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:40,693
Hey. Hey. Listen up!
- Look at him. Look.

205
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:43,205
There's 20 million cars built
in this country every year,

206
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:44,741
and every one of them
is gonna need our wiper.

207
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,105
Wow!
- Huh?

208
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,201
And guess who's gonna
manufacture those.

209
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,303
Who, Dad?

210
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,540
Us.

211
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:51,774
We are?

212
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:53,510
Yeah, we are.
In fact, here you go.

213
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:57,680
I want to toast to the
Kearns Corporation right here

214
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:01,516
and its board
of directors.

215
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,723
Lou Galin's two weeks
late on that glass shipment.

216
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:05,887
What do you
want me to do?

217
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:08,295
Well, why don't you give
him a call? He's your buddy.

218
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:11,027
Did you pay him?
- Yeah. Half.

219
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:13,001
I'll call him.

220
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,170
Well, that's the
damnedest thing.

221
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:25,408
Yeah.

222
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:29,009
Get this, it's also possible to build
a timing control into the wiper column

223
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:31,316
so that you could adjust
the time between movements.

224
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:32,446
Well, why?

225
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:35,083
Well, because it obviously rains
at different intensity levels.

226
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,592
Yeah.
- Right.

227
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,992
That's part of
the whole idea.

228
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:40,325
What do you want
to do with it?

229
00:12:40,397 --> 00:12:42,058
Well, Bob wants
to manufacture it.

230
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:44,794
So from our end, we just put
up the dough for the patents,

231
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:47,029
research and development, all
of which goes through Kearns,

232
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:49,834
and we also seed the
money for manufacturing.

233
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:51,568
And I could be ready
to go very soon.

234
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:54,270
Yeah, it's a pretty
simple deal. The fact is,

235
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:58,441
if we can nail a quarter of cars
in America at, what, 50 bucks a pop?

236
00:12:58,515 --> 00:12:59,573
Think about it.

237
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,551
Just curious, do you have any
manufacturing experience, Mr. Kearns?

238
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,418
Inventing, with all due respect,
is one thing, but building is...

239
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:07,787
Well, Bob's background's in
engineering, so I don't see how...

240
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:09,951
Gil, Gil, let Bob talk,
for Christ's sake.

241
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:12,860
Right, right. Bob?
- Yeah, um...

242
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:17,290
Well, no actual
experience, no, not yet.

243
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:21,099
But, uh... Look, I know I'm
not your ordinary businessman.

244
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:22,160
I don't have
an MBA, but...

245
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:24,469
No apologies, Bob.
You're doing great.

246
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,065
We'll hold his hand
the whole time.

247
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,737
It's not gonna be a problem.
Yeah, it's a bet.

248
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:32,043
But so was the kidney
machine that keeps Dad alive.

249
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,351
Barely alive.
What are you gonna call it?

250
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:38,383
The Kearns Blinking
Eye Wiper.

251
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:43,886
Yeah. Well,
I'm not sure about the name.

252
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:47,223
You look sensational, hon.

253
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:48,594
Thanks.

254
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,129
You're a little
nervous, huh?

255
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:52,600
Aren't you?

256
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,728
No.

257
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:02,344
Welcome, ma'am.
- Thanks.

258
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:05,004
Welcome, sir.

259
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,508
Sir? Here you go.

260
00:14:10,954 --> 00:14:12,888
Funny, we've never been
inside here before.

261
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:15,083
Oh, yeah. I never
thought about it.

262
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,024
Well, start thinking
about it.

263
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:19,585
I want to be able to take
you to more places like this.

264
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:20,925
Okay.

265
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:24,365
No, really. This is a big
deal. Start of a new life.

266
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:27,560
You gonna quit teaching?

267
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:30,101
You think I should?

268
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:33,171
I think you should take
it a step at a time.

269
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:34,938
Oh, so you're saying
it's not gonna last.

270
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:37,503
No! I'm saying I'll
love you either way.

271
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:39,845
Which is French for
"be prepared to fail."

272
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,407
Robert!
- No.

273
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,680
I just want to do
something important.

274
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:45,085
You will.

275
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,288
Will you love me
more if I do?

276
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:50,019
No. I'll love you
more if you're rich.

277
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:54,863
I married a gold digger.
What do you know about that?

278
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,167
Oh, I just...
They're driving me crazy.

279
00:14:58,235 --> 00:15:00,669
They don't want to go to
the rec center anymore,

280
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:03,536
and at least when school starts,
that takes care of four of them.

281
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:07,099
And then we've just
got the two little ones at home,

282
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,042
but we have fun.

283
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,078
Well, ours are up at Harbor Springs.
They just love it up there.

284
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,640
Oh, I bet!
But you don't go with them?

285
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:17,482
Well, that's the problem.
It's just hard to find time to get away.

286
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:19,784
Right, Bob? They think it's
like summer camp up there.

287
00:15:19,857 --> 00:15:21,324
I don't even think they
notice we're not there.

288
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:22,449
Mmm.

289
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:28,226
Do you see Robert's eye?
Yeah, is that bothering you?

290
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:30,562
No.
- Do you know the story of Robert's eye?

291
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:32,568
Oh, Phyll, Phyll, forget it.
- The story of our wedding night?

292
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:34,968
It's such a funny
story, honey!

293
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:37,162
So, it's our
wedding night,

294
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:39,766
and I'm getting
ready in the bathroom

295
00:15:39,843 --> 00:15:41,037
and putting on my
little negligee.

296
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:42,703
Okay, okay, okay!

297
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,375
And Robert's in the next room,
opening a bottle of champagne.

298
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,042
Well, I'd never
opened one before.

299
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:50,678
Figures. Bob had never opened a bottle
of champagne before his wedding night.

300
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:54,884
So I had it down between my
legs, and I look down and, pow!

301
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,858
Cork goes off
right in my eye,

302
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,293
and I fall back on the sheets.
I was bleeding.

303
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:00,421
I come out and
start screaming.

304
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:02,362
Screaming bloody murder, Phyllis.
- I don't know what's happened.

305
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:03,763
But it all
turned out okay

306
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:04,960
and he made it
up to me later.

307
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,093
Hey, hey!

308
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,865
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>
<i>My name is Joe Warwick,</i>

309
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:09,803
<i>and I'm the guy who leaned
on you to come out tonight.</i>

310
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:11,738
<i>And I'm glad I did.</i>

311
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:14,503
<i>I want you to give yourselves</i>
<i>a big hand, because tonight,</i>

312
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:17,547
<i>we raised $11,000 for</i>
<i>the Children's Hospital.</i>

313
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:22,480
<i>Now, let's do some more dancing to
the sound of the Telegraph Five!</i>

314
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:25,982
Hey, let's dance.
- No.

315
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:28,081
It's okay, it's okay, come on.
- No, Phyllis. Phyllis.

316
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:29,352
Come on.

317
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,602
Hey. Say, Bob.
Phyllis, you look lovely.

318
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:45,335
Would you mind if Gil and I dragged
Bob outside for some business chat?

319
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,468
Where we can hear
ourselves think.

320
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:48,738
Go on.

321
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:54,381
We've got some real
interesting news for you.

322
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,653
Paul, when are they gonna
fix that seventeenth green?

323
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:58,710
I'm tired of playing
on that temporary green.

324
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:01,485
I'm on it, I'm on it. I took it to
the board. It'll get taken care of.

325
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:03,287
Bob, you don't play
golf, do you?

326
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,987
Uh, no, no.

327
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:09,524
So, Bob, we got some really
good feedback on the feelers

328
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,067
we put out for
the Blinking Eye.

329
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,694
Yeah, it turns out the concept
isn't as unique as we first thought.

330
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,931
The Big Three have assigned
their windshield wiper teams

331
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:17,837
to come up with an
intermittent wiper.

332
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:20,775
That's what they call it.
The Intermittent Wiper.

333
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:23,711
The Intermittent Wiper.
I'll be damned.

334
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,477
No, it's fine. More than anything,
now we know there's a demand for it.

335
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,076
Until now, your wiper
seemed like a clever gadget.

336
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:34,146
But they want it. And more importantly,
they haven't cracked it yet.

337
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:37,557
Mercury's been working on one for over
a year and they still haven't beaten it.

338
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:39,459
So we want to set up
a demonstration.

339
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,588
Now, Ford is very interested
in seeing what we have.

340
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:42,791
Ford?

341
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:46,430
You didn't mention
anything about...

342
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:48,027
Are you ready?

343
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:50,305
Wow, Ford. Wow.

344
00:17:50,374 --> 00:17:52,774
I don't know.
I mean, it needs some more work.

345
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:53,867
More consistency.

346
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:56,742
I can assure you we won't
sell it if we don't show it.

347
00:17:56,813 --> 00:18:00,180
Yeah, but should we be showing them ours if
they're already working on their own version?

348
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,274
Well, that's
up to you.

349
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:04,809
But maybe it's a good reason
to show it sooner than later.

350
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,018
I don't know, Gil.

351
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:10,751
Kearns, I'd hate to see
you if you got bad news.

352
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:12,561
We're not gonna let
anybody take it apart,

353
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:14,256
especially after the money
we've put into the patents.

354
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:17,732
We'll just give them a peek.
Cat stays in the bag.

355
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:31,207
Now, Paul's real
excited about this.

356
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:33,909
In fact, I haven't seen him
quite like that in a long time.

357
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:35,849
Well, I got
a lot to do.

358
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,150
No, I know, know.
By the way, this is yours.

359
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,686
Mine?

360
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,159
For now. No more
aquariums, Bob.

361
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:48,824
Just throw the unit in
here and take it to Ford.

362
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:51,492
Sal!

363
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:54,267
Sal here'll help
you put it in.

364
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,565
Just tell us what you want,
Mr. Kearns.

365
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,164
Okay.

366
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,983
He'll be here.

367
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:44,486
We're very busy
here, Mr. Previck.

368
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:48,717
This is him, yeah?
- Yeah.

369
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,963
Hiya, Bob.
- Hey, Gil.

370
00:19:59,636 --> 00:20:01,695
Frank Sertin, Vice President
of Research and Development,

371
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:02,761
meet Bob Kearns,

372
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,205
the inventor of the
Intermittent Windshield Wiper.

373
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:07,175
Oh, we'll see.
We'll see.

374
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:09,508
It's a real pleasure.
- Good. Thank you.

375
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,342
All right, Bob, let's
see what you got.

376
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:12,507
All right.
- And, Bob!

377
00:20:12,582 --> 00:20:13,981
We want you to do it
with the engine running.

378
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:18,750
We've found that the heat can play havoc
with some of the systems we've tried.

379
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:22,022
Right now?

380
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,958
Right now.

381
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,435
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where... Where's he going?

382
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:40,840
Bob's real
big on security.

383
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:44,611
Okay.

384
00:20:45,082 --> 00:20:48,176
Okay, Bob!
Come on, let her rip!

385
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,276
What's going on?
- I don't know.

386
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:20,675
Okay.

387
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,842
Bob?

388
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:23,215
I don't know.

389
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:29,249
Okay.

390
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:32,723
Bob!
- Yeah?

391
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:34,787
Oh, here! It's a fuse.

392
00:21:34,865 --> 00:21:36,924
It's the fuse.
- It's a fuse!

393
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:39,830
Yeah, we're good.

394
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,710
It'll do that all day,
engine running or not.

395
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:56,045
Well, that is...

396
00:21:58,488 --> 00:22:00,080
That's good.

397
00:22:00,157 --> 00:22:02,216
We call this
"variable speed."

398
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,816
Variable speed.

399
00:22:12,536 --> 00:22:14,094
"Variable dwell."

400
00:22:15,305 --> 00:22:17,296
That is very
impressive.

401
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,466
Gil, how about giving us a
little look under the hood, huh?

402
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:22,808
Sorry, Frank,
we can't do that.

403
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:26,115
He's not doing that
manually, is he?

404
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,544
Bob? Bob!

405
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:34,948
Uh, would you get
out of the car?

406
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:37,960
They think you might be
manipulating the controls.

407
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:39,495
Well, I am.

408
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:51,034
That is very
good, Bob.

409
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:52,597
That is very, very good.

410
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:55,008
I think we should get
you a copy of our specs.

411
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:57,546
But I can tell you this, though.
At a minimum, at a minimum,

412
00:22:57,614 --> 00:22:59,275
it's gonna have to run a
million and a half cycles

413
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,714
under real-time
conditions.

414
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:02,649
And operate...
Uh, excuse me.

415
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:04,744
What's the maximum
temperature under the hood?

416
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:07,289
It's, uh...
- Two hundred and seventy degrees.

417
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:08,585
Mmm-hmm.

418
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:13,455
If it operates in
the field like it did here...

419
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:15,425
Where'd you get
your degree?

420
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:17,125
Uh, Case Western.

421
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,294
I'm gonna look
under the hood.

422
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:20,393
Sorry, we'd rather not.

423
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,463
It's nothing against Ford, sir.
I've admired the company my whole life.

424
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,565
No problem.

425
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:28,008
But I'll get to work right away,
just as soon as I get the specs.

426
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:29,067
Okay, good, good.

427
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:31,636
Listen, I know that we are
gonna be in touch with you.

428
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:33,580
Yes, sir.
- Very good. Gil.

429
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,844
Frank.

430
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:38,980
Dr. Kearns?
Case Western.

431
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:41,489
That's a...
That's a good school.

432
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,003
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.

433
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:08,480
You did a hell
of a job, pal.

434
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:11,415
Hell of a job.

435
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:13,117
Thank you.

436
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,514
I'll see you.

437
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:22,962
Well, there's
a difference between

438
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:24,830
a good idea and
a good product.

439
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:26,994
I've had a lot
of good ideas.

440
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,005
Just nothing that's quite
clicked, you know?

441
00:24:30,473 --> 00:24:33,567
It makes you wonder what it
is makes a man successful.

442
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:34,837
Brains?

443
00:24:35,545 --> 00:24:36,773
Talent?

444
00:24:37,347 --> 00:24:41,784
Of course, there's a lot of unsuccessful
talents running around out there.

445
00:24:43,553 --> 00:24:45,418
Maybe this is the one.

446
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,123
Maybe this'll get you where
you want to be, you know?

447
00:24:50,827 --> 00:24:52,124
Yeah.

448
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:56,721
But I don't know. I look at you
and I look at us and I just think

449
00:24:59,235 --> 00:25:02,068
you're a success.
Don't you feel that way?

450
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:05,804
Maybe it's some
other thing.

451
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,537
Like luck, timing.

452
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:13,778
Some intangible
thing like that.

453
00:25:15,752 --> 00:25:17,617
It haunts me a little.

454
00:25:22,158 --> 00:25:23,785
I'm gonna get some more tea.
Do you want anything?

455
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,953
No, I'm good.
- No? Okay.

456
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:32,127
I explained it to
her, and then she just, like...

457
00:25:32,202 --> 00:25:33,794
Patrick, come on
with that paper!

458
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,497
I'm good, I got it!

459
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,141
Okay, it's Tuesday,
"Cold, clear and sunny.

460
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,574
"Wednesday,
clear and warmer."

461
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:44,169
Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, give it back!

462
00:25:44,247 --> 00:25:45,271
Let him have it.

463
00:25:45,348 --> 00:25:47,111
Okay, "Thursday, clear.

464
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:51,517
"Friday, partly cloudy and
colder, and a clearing on Sunday."

465
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:53,212
Well, we
need some rain.

466
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:55,951
Maybe instead of grace, we
should say a prayer, Dad.

467
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:58,050
Didn't we just say grace already?
- Yeah.

468
00:25:58,128 --> 00:26:01,325
No, no, that's okay.
That's okay. Let's do that. Come on.

469
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:02,672
Let's do a little prayer here, huh?

470
00:26:02,673 --> 00:26:04,856
When you say a prayer, you're
supposed to fold your hands.

471
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:08,768
Dear God, thank you for all the
sunshine you've been sending.

472
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:11,599
We know in your
infinite wisdom,

473
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:15,166
you managed to create the elasticity
of rain water different than tap.

474
00:26:15,245 --> 00:26:16,542
If you could see it
in your good graces

475
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:20,049
to, you know,
send us some rain

476
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:22,846
so that we can test the Blinking
Eye in real-life conditions,

477
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,149
we'd appreciate it.
Amen.

478
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:26,412
Amen.

479
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:28,184
Do you think he heard you,
Daddy?

480
00:26:28,258 --> 00:26:29,850
My luck,
he's a G.M. man.

481
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:34,224
Go, go, go!

482
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:37,698
Careful! Dennis, in the
back! Maureen, be careful!

483
00:26:50,313 --> 00:26:52,747
And it's working, too.
Watch that, watch that.

484
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:57,148
I can adjust the speed, too.
I can adjust it.

485
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:20,406
Look at that.
- Yeah.

486
00:27:20,477 --> 00:27:21,967
Perfect.
- That was awesome.

487
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:24,343
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, you see
that car across the street?

488
00:27:24,414 --> 00:27:24,814
Oh, yeah.

489
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:26,905
Look at the driver.
He's staring right at us.

490
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,740
He thinks I'm turning
the wiper on and off here.

491
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:29,816
You think he can tell?

492
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:32,320
Look at this. No, no!
Look here.

493
00:27:32,388 --> 00:27:36,722
Look at that, mister. No hands! He's
wondering what the heck's going on!

494
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,252
How's he doing that?

495
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:39,989
No hands.
- Hi.

496
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:42,497
How the heck are
they doing that?

497
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:47,469
We got ourselves a winner here,
I'd say.

498
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:49,961
Ford Motor Company.
How can I help you?

499
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,199
What's the deal?

500
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:54,141
Well, he's got it,
and it really seems to work.

501
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,837
And you've gone
through it completely?

502
00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:58,039
As close as we could
from a distance.

503
00:27:58,114 --> 00:28:00,105
He hasn't
actually let us do any surgery.

504
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:01,343
Why not?

505
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,214
He's nervous about
people getting too close.

506
00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:06,380
Mack, he is a particular kinda guy.

507
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:09,353
Well, whatever.
We gotta get this puppy moving.

508
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:12,758
The marketing department's all over me.
They think they can sell the shit out of it.

509
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,421
What's he want?

510
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:16,892
To build it.

511
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,957
He wants to manufacture it?
Himself?

512
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,367
Apparently, that's
his dream, yeah.

513
00:28:21,437 --> 00:28:24,338
Okay, well,
we'll deal with that later.

514
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:27,103
Right now we need
to get him on board.

515
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:28,770
Okay.

516
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:35,716
Come on in,
guys. Bob, Dick Gordon.

517
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:37,844
There you go.
- Nice to see you again.

518
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:42,084
Gil, nice to
see you again.

519
00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:43,887
You, too, Macklin.

520
00:28:45,128 --> 00:28:46,595
This is
Dr. Bob Kearns.

521
00:28:46,663 --> 00:28:50,155
Bob Kearns, winner of the
wiper competition. Congrats.

522
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:54,294
Bob, I've been going over the reports on your
Intermittent. It looks like you cracked it.

523
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,530
Have you worked up
a unit price yet?

524
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:57,971
No. Not yet.
I'm hoping to...

525
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,941
Good. And you do want
to manufacture it?

526
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:02,739
Yes, sir.
I want to come through for Ford.

527
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:05,975
And we like that. So let's
get a unit price, then.

528
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:08,916
Frank, have you sent a
working unit to Washington?

529
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:12,887
No, Mack, we haven't.
Bob's... He's not comfortable with that.

530
00:29:12,956 --> 00:29:14,150
Really?

531
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,449
Now, Bob, you do understand
this is a safety device.

532
00:29:16,526 --> 00:29:19,927
And before we can install any
safety device on any of our cars,

533
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:22,055
we have to submit it to
Washington for approval.

534
00:29:22,131 --> 00:29:24,292
And that means we're gonna
need a working unit from you.

535
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:28,167
I understand that. And I understand
I'll need your cars for my wipers.

536
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:31,203
But I thought that,
uh, if we had a...

537
00:29:31,274 --> 00:29:33,139
We like to work closely
with our people, Bob.

538
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:35,268
That's...
That's the deal.

539
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:37,142
Nothing else would make sense.
I'm sure Gil will tell you that

540
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:39,773
we have a very close relationship
with Previck Automotive.

541
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:42,647
Bob knows that.
That's why we came here first.

542
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,812
He's right, though,
Bob. It does need to be approved.

543
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:48,084
We're interested in offering the
Intermittent as an option on at least

544
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:51,923
one model next year. From there, our
plan is to expand it to the entire line.

545
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:55,431
Now, that means we're working
under a serious deadline.

546
00:29:55,498 --> 00:29:58,990
So we're gonna need a unit
from you as fast as possible.

547
00:29:59,202 --> 00:30:02,262
Okay. Yeah,
I can do that.

548
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:03,430
Great.

549
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:04,939
Let's get started on
the legal right away.

550
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:05,997
Right, gentlemen?
- Absolutely.

551
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:08,407
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

552
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:11,038
I'll get my demo and
research over to Mr. Sertin.

553
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:14,811
Excellent. This is what it's all
about, Bob. Corporate "can do."

554
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:16,476
How about that?

555
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:23,486
Now, remember. There's a right way
and a wrong way to do this, okay?

556
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,891
Whatever you do, don't let
them think that it's perfect.

557
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:27,190
But what if it is?

558
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:28,423
Hey, listen to
your father now.

559
00:30:28,498 --> 00:30:30,432
Here, you wanna take him?
No, I'm serious about this.

560
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,058
Be very careful
what you say, okay?

561
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:35,229
The moment they think they got a
sucker in the line, you're dead.

562
00:30:35,304 --> 00:30:36,965
Here he comes.

563
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,941
Just everybody take it easy.
Let him come to us a little bit, okay?

564
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:42,102
We'll be fine.
Let me do the talking.

565
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:43,202
What's new about that?

566
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,406
Hey! No back talk.
Come here.

567
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:47,446
Michael?
- Hi.

568
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:49,451
How are you? Bob Kearns.
- Nice to meet you, Bob.

569
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:55,548
How big is it?

570
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,092
Thirty thousand
square feet.

571
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,152
Structurally, this is as sound as
any building you'll find in Detroit.

572
00:31:00,229 --> 00:31:03,289
The loading ramps are more than
ample for any job you may have.

573
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:04,993
Sure looks like it
needs a lot of work.

574
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:07,502
We're concerned about the price.
Is it the best you can do?

575
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,869
Well, we can probably work out an eight
cents per foot improvement, Mrs. Kearns.

576
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,635
What do you think, guys?
- How much is it?

577
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:14,472
Fifty cents
a square foot.

578
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:14,722
No.

579
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:17,513
No, we were figuring
on a lot less than that.

580
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,071
I think the owners
might come down a bit.

581
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:22,879
Well, we'll have to think about it.
- Hey!

582
00:31:22,952 --> 00:31:25,011
You hear that echo?
This place is solid!

583
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:28,888
It's perfect, Michael.
Absolutely perfect! I love it.

584
00:31:34,464 --> 00:31:35,488
It's such a simple idea.

585
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:38,830
I'm amazed no one's cracked it before.
Where did you do your research?

586
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:40,391
My basement.

587
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:44,198
So, these S.D. 25s
are fixed costs?

588
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:47,242
Yes, we can do a discount
after 400,000 units.

589
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:51,439
I assume you'll put the Ford contracts up
against costs. They're backing it, right?

590
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:54,574
Oh, yeah. We're down the road on
all that. My biggest concern is

591
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,015
that you'll be able
to provide us with

592
00:31:56,085 --> 00:31:58,849
the necessary transistors
and circuits that we need.

593
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:02,618
Mr. Kearns, Motorola is the biggest
electronics manufacturer in the world.

594
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:06,128
I think if we can supply the
Pentagon, we can supply you.

595
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:07,719
The who?
- The...

596
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:11,026
That's a good one.

597
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:22,066
Hiya, Bob.
- Hi.

598
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:27,206
The gentleman at Motorola put me in
touch with their finance department.

599
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:29,114
Yeah. Yeah. Bob?

600
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:31,949
No, I'm serious about this.
We should talk about cash flows...

601
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:33,454
Want me to take your order?
- Yes.

602
00:32:33,523 --> 00:32:35,718
Actually, do you mind
giving us a second?

603
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,419
Sure.
- Thanks, hon.

604
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:39,290
Sorry, I'm starving.

605
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,790
They want out, Bob.

606
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:46,630
Who wants out?
- Ford.

607
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:50,594
What?

608
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:52,698
They're just not
interested anymore.

609
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:56,643
Wait, wait, what... What do
you mean? Well... What happened?

610
00:32:56,712 --> 00:32:57,906
I'm not sure.

611
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,038
Well, who did
you talk to?

612
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:01,106
Tyler. Yeah.
- Macklin?

613
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,515
What did he
say exactly?

614
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:04,018
Like I said,
they want out.

615
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:05,075
Out?

616
00:33:05,154 --> 00:33:07,884
They're not ready yet, and they're
not gonna make a move until they are.

617
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:11,393
They gave me a line like, you know,
"It's not the Ford style."

618
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,428
Out, or ready, Gil?
Which one is it?

619
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:15,964
Hang on a second.
I'm in this, too.

620
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:19,593
They have the unit.

621
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:21,102
We'll get it back.
- When?

622
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,159
I don't know.

623
00:33:22,238 --> 00:33:23,967
I closed on the
operating loan.

624
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,167
Well, don't forget,
I thought you should slow down on that.

625
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:27,266
They're loading
in transistors.

626
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:29,607
We're gonna figure this out.
All we gotta do is take it to another...

627
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,941
Bullshit.

628
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:38,019
Listen. Chrysler,
A.M.C., G. M...

629
00:33:38,087 --> 00:33:40,555
My kids. It's my kids.

630
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:44,588
Ford was our best bet.
We both know that. But we're not done.

631
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:47,927
Okay, but they... They strung us along,
and they looked at my work.

632
00:33:47,997 --> 00:33:49,191
I know.

633
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:51,261
I know.

634
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:52,801
We had a deal.

635
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:55,265
I think they might be
negotiating here, Gil.

636
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,930
No. They're not.

637
00:33:57,707 --> 00:33:59,641
You sure? Because I haven't...
- Yeah.

638
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:01,574
It's dead there, Bob.

639
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:05,707
My God.

640
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:33,400
All the boxes are going in
the cage until you know where they go!

641
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:01,726
Professor Kearns.
Find what you want?

642
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:04,103
Yes, Louis, thanks.

643
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:06,869
"State Highway System:
History and Facts."

644
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:08,001
This for one of
your classes?

645
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:12,377
No, I'm just doing some work for the
state, analyzing pavement erosion.

646
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:13,539
Nothing too exciting.

647
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:15,516
Yeah, but they're paying
you to come up with stuff.

648
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,884
Sounds pretty good to me. You know,
I'm sort of a amateur idea man myself.

649
00:35:19,956 --> 00:35:22,720
A few of us even have
an inventors' club.

650
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:25,352
Maybe I can call you sometime,
ask you some questions.

651
00:35:25,428 --> 00:35:26,793
Absolutely.

652
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:18,672
Hey, you guys are late.
Take it around the back entrance.

653
00:36:44,507 --> 00:36:47,772
Have your invitations
out and ready, please.

654
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:50,571
Hey, folks,
welcome to Ford.

655
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:56,647
Got your invitation, sir?
- Yeah. Right here.

656
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,981
There are
tons of options.

657
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:00,818
Excuse me, sir.
Please don't touch the car.

658
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:05,451
It comes with Select Air
air conditioning in all the models,

659
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:06,552
and many options
are available.

660
00:37:06,629 --> 00:37:07,789
What about the tires?

661
00:37:07,863 --> 00:37:10,354
Oh, beautiful
Magnum 500 wheels...

662
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:15,165
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

663
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:16,966
<i>Come on and fly with me</i>

664
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,973
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

665
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:20,565
<i>And take a drive with me</i>

666
00:37:20,643 --> 00:37:22,474
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

667
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:26,504
<i>And try a Ford with me</i>
<i>Don't stop! Don't stop!</i>

668
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:28,106
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

669
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:29,412
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

670
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:31,510
<i>Our Fords</i>
<i>are bright tonight</i>

671
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:33,350
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

672
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:35,151
<i>They're outta sight tonight</i>

673
00:37:35,224 --> 00:37:36,953
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

674
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:41,087
<i>They're really right tonight</i>
<i>Don't stop! Don't stop!</i>

675
00:37:41,163 --> 00:37:42,790
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

676
00:37:42,865 --> 00:37:45,527
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>members of the Ford family.</i>

677
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:48,468
<i>Introducing the new, the
redesigned, the finest</i>

678
00:37:48,537 --> 00:37:51,734
<i>Ford Mustang in the history</i>
<i>of the Ford Motor Company.</i>

679
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:54,241
<i>With more options</i>
<i>than ever before.</i>

680
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,710
<i>Stereo, rear window defroster</i>

681
00:37:56,779 --> 00:38:01,273
<i>and the brand-new electronic Intermittent
Windshield Wiper. Let's give it a hand!</i>

682
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,485
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, have you seen
anything that's sexier than that?</i>

683
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,927
<i>And I'm talking about the car
now, not the Mustang girls,</i>

684
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:18,364
<i>who, by the way, know these</i>
<i>automobiles inside out.</i>

685
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:21,961
<i>Don't hesitate to ask them any
questions you have, and remember,</i>

686
00:38:22,037 --> 00:38:26,269
<i>in the main auditorium we have
all of next year's exciting buys!</i>

687
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:40,178
Excuse me, sir.
Could I see your invitation?

688
00:38:40,256 --> 00:38:42,986
Uh, I'm with,
uh, Mr. Tyler.

689
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:44,753
Why don't we talk
about it outside?

690
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:45,919
No, I'm with Mr...

691
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:46,984
Mr. Tyler!

692
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:49,121
Sir, please.
Right this way.

693
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:51,321
Mr. Tyler!

694
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,958
Right this way, sir.

695
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:55,934
Sir, outside.
Thank you.

696
00:38:57,973 --> 00:38:59,304
Okay. Easy.

697
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,740
Step outside.
- Easy!

698
00:39:01,777 --> 00:39:03,438
Their story is that they
went with another design,

699
00:39:03,512 --> 00:39:05,036
one they had in the
works before ours.

700
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:06,206
Yeah, and that's...
- Or yours.

701
00:39:06,282 --> 00:39:07,715
...just what it is.
It's a story.

702
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:09,045
It's a goddamn lie.

703
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:09,671
Come on.

704
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:11,712
No, no, I took apart
one of their motors, Gil.

705
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:15,484
You know what I found inside?
Transistors, capacitors, variable resistors.

706
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:17,458
Now, that is my design!

707
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:22,656
What about the patents?
Aren't they worth anything?

708
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:24,790
Legally, they're
Previck's patents.

709
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,061
What is that
supposed to mean?

710
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:28,501
Nothing. It's
a technical term.

711
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:30,866
Barney's putting together
another letter. It's tougher.

712
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,271
You can take a look at
it once it's drafted.

713
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:33,638
Another letter?

714
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:35,802
A letter? Gil, they
stole this from us!

715
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,813
Whoa! Let's be careful
with our language.

716
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:40,314
Let's not use words
like "steal."

717
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:42,407
Who the hell is this guy?
Huh?

718
00:39:42,484 --> 00:39:42,717
Bob...

719
00:39:42,718 --> 00:39:44,349
Who the hell are you?
What's your angle?

720
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,821
Bob! We gotta be really
strategic about this. Methodical.

721
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,620
And whatever you say
reflects on all of us.

722
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:53,594
So we're gonna fight it, but
we're gonna do it the right way.

723
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:55,459
How long is it gonna
take to get an answer?

724
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:58,261
First, this is Ford.
It won't be quick.

725
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:02,668
Second, patents.
Christ, they're a minefield.

726
00:40:02,738 --> 00:40:06,037
Not to mention, the patent
courts are totally jammed.

727
00:40:06,442 --> 00:40:08,000
It's gonna take
some time.

728
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:12,309
Well, whatever it takes.
The point is, this is all gonna be okay.

729
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:19,010
Good. And in the meantime, let's
go a little softer on the language.

730
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:28,329
So, a lot of these formulas work
in opposition with one another.

731
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:32,231
So that a capacitive
reactance,

732
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:39,269
uh, varies inversely
with the product

733
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:42,234
of both...

734
00:40:43,312 --> 00:40:44,745
Uh, frequency?

735
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:46,713
Yeah. Did I
call on you?

736
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:48,743
Sorry.

737
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:53,486
Frequency, yes.
And capacitance. Make a note of it.

738
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:58,725
I'm gonna take
a quick break.

739
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:03,087
<i>Mr. Previck would appreciate
your patience in this matter.</i>

740
00:41:03,165 --> 00:41:07,499
Yes, well, I'd appreciate it if Mr.
Previck could return my phone call.

741
00:41:42,104 --> 00:41:44,732
Who is it?
- It's Mr. Kearns.

742
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:46,636
Come in, Mr. Kearns.

743
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:48,768
Oh, hi, Wade.
- Hi.

744
00:41:48,844 --> 00:41:50,334
Wade, did you
ask who it was?

745
00:41:50,412 --> 00:41:52,141
He did, Jean. Hi.

746
00:41:52,214 --> 00:41:54,444
Hi. Bob!
What's going on?

747
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:56,507
Uh, is Gil here?

748
00:41:56,585 --> 00:41:59,554
It's not really a great time
right now. You should have called.

749
00:41:59,621 --> 00:42:02,522
Jean, hon, do you mind
getting me a refill?

750
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:03,785
Sure, hon.

751
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,727
Thanks, hon.
I'll just be a second.

752
00:42:06,795 --> 00:42:08,228
Okay.

753
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:12,158
I'm sorry. I...
- Hang on a second.

754
00:42:12,234 --> 00:42:14,566
I thought we were gonna stay
in communication here, so...

755
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:16,866
Don't you think it's a little outta
line, you coming over like this?

756
00:42:16,939 --> 00:42:19,931
Okay, well, you haven't
returned my calls in six days.

757
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:21,566
I'm not sure
I like your tone.

758
00:42:21,643 --> 00:42:24,237
I'm through waiting. I'm not
gonna sit around and do nothing.

759
00:42:24,313 --> 00:42:25,803
You're not
doing nothing.

760
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,543
You called the lawyer,
you pulled Taylor out of a mock trial.

761
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:30,084
You're on everybody.

762
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:32,552
You even called my father,
for crying out loud. He's sick!

763
00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:35,613
Tell me one thing.
Are you backing out of this?

764
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:38,152
What I'm doing is
looking at our options

765
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:40,661
like any sensible
person would.

766
00:42:40,729 --> 00:42:42,560
Of course they're stonewalling us.
What do you expect?

767
00:42:42,631 --> 00:42:44,656
So then we take
them to court!

768
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:45,859
Is that right?

769
00:42:45,934 --> 00:42:50,200
This is Detroit, Bob.
I did $17 million in business last year.

770
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:52,234
You want to guess what
I'm gonna do next year

771
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:53,740
if I start taking my
customers to court?

772
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:56,903
This is not about money. This is
about right and wrong, and you know it.

773
00:42:56,979 --> 00:42:58,446
For Christ's sake,
you're my friend!

774
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:00,709
That's right. I am.

775
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:03,275
Did you ask to be
involved in this deal?

776
00:43:03,352 --> 00:43:05,343
You need some
perspective.

777
00:43:05,788 --> 00:43:10,384
You need to take a hard look at reality
and realize what we're up against.

778
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:11,892
It's not your
only good idea.

779
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,726
You've been coming up with stuff
like this since you were 14.

780
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,227
Now, I need to get back to my
dinner, so we'll continue this later.

781
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:25,403
I'll go it alone.

782
00:43:25,474 --> 00:43:28,170
No. Leave it
alone. Bob?

783
00:43:29,978 --> 00:43:31,639
It's not over yet.

784
00:43:44,026 --> 00:43:46,017
I'm not gonna
back off of this.

785
00:43:46,528 --> 00:43:50,055
We don't have the money to
bring in lawyers right now,

786
00:43:50,132 --> 00:43:51,827
so we're gonna have to do the
legwork ourselves, and then...

787
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,333
Are you talking about
suing Gil Previck?

788
00:43:53,402 --> 00:43:55,302
No. No, we're gonna go
after the Ford Motor Company.

789
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,632
They're the ones that screwed us.
- What?

790
00:43:56,705 --> 00:43:58,104
Gil just let me down.

791
00:43:58,173 --> 00:43:59,265
Robert, slow down.
We're...

792
00:43:59,341 --> 00:44:01,070
No, no, we're gonna have
to dig up everything

793
00:44:01,143 --> 00:44:03,338
that's ever been
written about me. Okay?

794
00:44:03,412 --> 00:44:05,539
Character stuff,
everything.

795
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:09,675
<i>This is my number one priority, Phyllis.</i>
<i>Whatever it's gonna take.</i>

796
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,087
Josh, I'm gonna need at
least 10 new wiper motors.

797
00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:14,816
And some of the
earlier versions, too.

798
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,289
Sure, Professor.
Not a problem.

799
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:17,916
Good. And
circuit boards.

800
00:44:17,993 --> 00:44:19,984
Yeah, they just trash
the test models anyway.

801
00:44:20,062 --> 00:44:22,360
All right, um, where
are we gonna do this?

802
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:25,628
I'll meet you at the first
lab on the second floor.

803
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:26,861
Okay.

804
00:44:28,637 --> 00:44:30,229
Where's the
itemization file?

805
00:44:30,305 --> 00:44:32,773
All the files
are in here, hon.

806
00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:34,103
You should see a doctor.

807
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:36,474
Oh, I'm fine.
Let's keep going.

808
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:39,241
Previck Automotive
Legal Affairs.

809
00:44:39,314 --> 00:44:43,080
Something to bring their attention
that various automotive manufacturers

810
00:44:43,151 --> 00:44:46,552
are considering using
electronic intermittent wiper...

811
00:44:46,622 --> 00:44:47,646
I don't have it yet.

812
00:44:47,723 --> 00:44:50,556
Considering using electronic
intermittent wiper control...

813
00:44:50,626 --> 00:44:51,991
Do you want to list who?
- Yes.

814
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,723
And that these are in direct
violation of patents jointly held

815
00:44:55,797 --> 00:44:58,766
by both Previck and
Kearns Corporation.

816
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:01,826
As the inventor of the
Intermittent Wiper, I ask, no...

817
00:45:01,904 --> 00:45:04,304
I demand that they take
immediate legal action.

818
00:45:04,373 --> 00:45:07,240
"Demand" is too strong.
They're our friends.

819
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:08,571
What difference
does it make?

820
00:45:08,644 --> 00:45:10,612
They're not gonna
read it anyway.

821
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:11,668
Then why are
we doing this?

822
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:13,214
Because it makes
me feel better.

823
00:45:13,282 --> 00:45:14,340
Does it?

824
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:18,910
What is this file?
What is this?

825
00:45:21,456 --> 00:45:25,051
Kathy won it in the swim meet.
She wanted you to see it.

826
00:45:31,066 --> 00:45:33,933
This is a bad
case of psoriasis.

827
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:36,937
Now, Phyllis, I want you to take
care of yourself. Use the medication.

828
00:45:37,005 --> 00:45:38,836
Here's the sample.
- Thanks.

829
00:45:38,907 --> 00:45:41,034
And I'm going to write
you a prescription.

830
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:42,599
How long do I
take that for?

831
00:45:42,678 --> 00:45:44,509
Well, just a month.

832
00:45:45,647 --> 00:45:49,777
I don't know what's going on with you,
Phyllis, but this is all stress-related.

833
00:45:49,851 --> 00:45:52,684
You understand me? You have to
take the stress level way down.

834
00:45:52,754 --> 00:45:53,846
I'll be fine.

835
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:08,727
Hello, Jean.
- Phyllis.

836
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:10,635
How are the kids?
- Good.

837
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:14,172
Phyllis.

838
00:46:16,178 --> 00:46:17,975
Why is Bob
doing this?

839
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:21,078
He can't stand
being called a liar.

840
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:23,549
Well, nobody's
saying that he is.

841
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:25,383
They might as well be.

842
00:46:25,454 --> 00:46:29,254
Oh, for God's sake, Phyllis,
it's Ford. He can't win.

843
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:31,986
Take care, Jean.

844
00:46:46,508 --> 00:46:48,339
Oh! God!

845
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,311
Yeah.
Med school gives them to us.

846
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,280
We use them
for crash tests.

847
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:55,316
You should see it when we
drop them down elevator shafts.

848
00:46:55,384 --> 00:46:57,284
It's very instructive.

849
00:46:57,352 --> 00:47:00,412
I'll try that sometime.
Did you get the boards?

850
00:47:01,657 --> 00:47:02,885
What the hell is this?

851
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:06,291
I know, it's just motors.
I couldn't get any circuit boards.

852
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:07,419
Why not?

853
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:11,091
They didn't have any extras. Didn't
have any complete units. I don't know.

854
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,690
These are nothing.

855
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:14,258
Hey, man, this is
the best I could do.

856
00:47:14,336 --> 00:47:15,997
This doesn't
help me, Josh!

857
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:17,163
I'm sorry.

858
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:19,469
What does that mean?

859
00:47:22,244 --> 00:47:23,768
Wait a minute.

860
00:47:25,147 --> 00:47:27,047
Did somebody
talk to you?

861
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,512
Did you have a
conversation about me?

862
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:33,079
What?

863
00:47:34,523 --> 00:47:36,491
Are you working
with them?

864
00:47:37,693 --> 00:47:39,126
Huh? You even know
who they are?

865
00:47:39,194 --> 00:47:40,718
Man, I gotta go.

866
00:47:40,796 --> 00:47:41,854
They're the...

867
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,490
They're the ones who don't
give a shit about you!

868
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:35,610
Hey! Hey!

869
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,541
Come on!

870
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:42,641
What the hell are you doing?
Hey! Hey!

871
00:51:39,901 --> 00:51:43,200
Look at this lady.
She had five babies at the same time.

872
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:47,673
That's quintuplets,
that's what they're called.

873
00:51:54,082 --> 00:51:55,106
Hello.

874
00:51:55,183 --> 00:51:56,377
<i>Is this</i>
<i>Mrs. Robert Kearns?</i>

875
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:57,475
Yes.

876
00:51:57,552 --> 00:52:00,112
<i>Mrs. Kearns, this is Trooper Dale with
the Maryland State Police Department.</i>

877
00:52:00,188 --> 00:52:00,412
Yes.

878
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:02,816
<i>We've located your husband, ma'am.</i>

879
00:52:02,891 --> 00:52:03,983
Is he okay?

880
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:05,651
<i>Well, he was found on a bus</i>
<i>outside of Brunswick.</i>

881
00:52:05,727 --> 00:52:09,185
A bus? Where is he?
May I speak to him, please?

882
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:11,061
<i>Uh, no, ma'am,</i>
<i>he's not here.</i>

883
00:52:11,132 --> 00:52:13,532
<i>He's being transported</i>
<i>to a hospital facility in Rockville.</i>

884
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:15,034
What happened?

885
00:52:15,103 --> 00:52:18,698
<i>Sorry, I don't know exactly, but you'll
hear from the hospital when he arrives.</i>

886
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:19,762
<i>Will you be at</i>
<i>this number?</i>

887
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:21,604
Yes, we'll be here.
Thank you so much.

888
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:22,870
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Kearns.</i>

889
00:52:22,944 --> 00:52:24,434
Thank you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

890
00:52:43,631 --> 00:52:45,292
Hey, Bob.

891
00:52:49,738 --> 00:52:51,569
Chair or couch today?

892
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:53,038
Your choice.

893
00:52:55,243 --> 00:52:57,006
How's it going?
- Okay,

894
00:52:57,612 --> 00:52:59,011
I guess.
- Good.

895
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:03,708
I don't feel like I need
to talk about it today.

896
00:53:04,586 --> 00:53:05,678
Okay.

897
00:53:12,093 --> 00:53:14,186
It is hard getting past it.

898
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:16,054
I'm sure it is.

899
00:53:21,036 --> 00:53:23,368
Did you write any
of these books?

900
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:27,932
I did. There's a thesis and several
binders full of journal articles.

901
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:33,208
How would you feel if another
doctor took credit for those?

902
00:53:33,948 --> 00:53:38,282
Just came along and
put his name on there.

903
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,381
I take your point.

904
00:53:40,455 --> 00:53:44,050
But at the same time, if getting
my name back on those articles

905
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,457
overwhelmed my responsibilities
here at the hospital,

906
00:53:46,528 --> 00:53:48,860
or kept me from
creating new work,

907
00:53:49,364 --> 00:53:51,932
would that be worth it?
Would it be healthy?

908
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:52,731
I don't know.

909
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:54,792
I can't answer that.

910
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:57,360
Do you want to
continue fighting this?

911
00:53:57,439 --> 00:53:58,463
No.

912
00:54:01,176 --> 00:54:02,734
No. No, I don't.

913
00:54:24,032 --> 00:54:25,590
Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

914
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,872
Who is that?

915
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:41,912
Come on, you
guys. Tim?

916
00:54:55,363 --> 00:54:57,297
Come here, you. How you doing?
- Hi, Daddy.

917
00:54:57,365 --> 00:54:58,855
Hi, how are you guys?
- Daddy, I made you a picture

918
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:00,161
Daddy!
- I'll get the bag.

919
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:01,964
No, I got
the bag. Tim, let go!

920
00:55:02,036 --> 00:55:04,231
You look good.
- Where's Dennis?

921
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:06,773
You okay? He's coming later.
He's just late.

922
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:07,967
How are you, buddy?
- You okay?

923
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:42,798
Hey.

924
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:51,879
What do you say we round up the
board of directors and go for a ride?

925
00:55:55,223 --> 00:55:57,123
Kearns Corporation.
- Mmm.

926
00:55:59,427 --> 00:56:00,894
No, I'm fine.

927
00:56:23,785 --> 00:56:25,446
Let's see here.

928
00:56:27,322 --> 00:56:29,756
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

929
00:56:30,325 --> 00:56:33,385
How do you pronounce
your name? Kee-urns?

930
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:34,450
Kearns.

931
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:36,087
Mr. Kearns.

932
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:39,159
An inventor.
Mmm-hmm.

933
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:41,594
What have you invented?

934
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:43,135
A lot of things.

935
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:45,729
Yeah, my brother-in-law
does a lot of that.

936
00:56:45,807 --> 00:56:50,039
Never sold anything, though.
He's actually in pest control.

937
00:56:50,445 --> 00:56:52,640
You really a doctor?

938
00:56:52,714 --> 00:56:53,738
Ph.D.

939
00:56:53,815 --> 00:56:54,975
Uh-huh.

940
00:56:56,451 --> 00:56:59,852
Well, Doctor, take a look
at your information.

941
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:02,719
Make sure it's correct.
Sign at the bottom.

942
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:07,286
You'll probably get your
first check in about six weeks.

943
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:09,660
Proceed to the third
window on your left.

944
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:10,993
Thank you.

945
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:12,763
Move forward.

946
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:28,573
Hi.

947
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:33,346
Can I talk to you
for a second?

948
00:57:33,421 --> 00:57:34,911
Am I in trouble?

949
00:57:35,223 --> 00:57:36,281
No.

950
00:57:48,002 --> 00:57:52,564
I know you're mad at me.
Is it because I embarrassed you?

951
00:57:54,676 --> 00:57:56,166
Because I got sick?

952
00:57:56,244 --> 00:57:57,677
I don't like
you like this.

953
00:57:57,745 --> 00:58:00,305
Okay. Well, that's why
I want to talk to you.

954
00:58:00,381 --> 00:58:03,282
I didn't like it like
it was before, either.

955
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:06,478
I didn't do
anything wrong.

956
00:58:06,988 --> 00:58:10,856
Look, Dennis, if I don't fight
back, if I don't do something,

957
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:13,325
I'm afraid I'm gonna start
feeling like I did before.

958
00:58:13,394 --> 00:58:15,294
And I can't
handle that.

959
00:58:17,665 --> 00:58:20,395
I got a lawyer.
And it's gonna be difficult.

960
00:58:20,468 --> 00:58:21,833
And it's gonna be
tough on your mom.

961
00:58:21,903 --> 00:58:25,202
And I may not be around as much.
And I need your help.

962
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,399
You're just starting this all over again.
- No, this is different.

963
00:58:33,915 --> 00:58:36,042
Is that all you
have to say?

964
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:37,475
Yeah.

965
00:58:46,227 --> 00:58:49,162
And I'll tell you something.
Now, I'm old-fashioned.

966
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:53,564
I'm not out for the quick score.
This firm is in this for the long haul.

967
00:58:53,768 --> 00:58:56,999
That's why I'm very glad that
you're here today, Mrs. Kearns.

968
00:58:57,071 --> 00:58:59,938
From several phone calls with
Bob, I think I understand now

969
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:01,269
what his level
of commitment is.

970
00:59:01,342 --> 00:59:03,742
But this is part
of your life, too.

971
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:06,404
I'd like to know where
you stand on this.

972
00:59:06,481 --> 00:59:09,609
I want to understand
exactly what this would be.

973
00:59:09,717 --> 00:59:10,775
What it would
mean for us.

974
00:59:10,852 --> 00:59:11,910
Well, as long as
you know that

975
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:15,683
suing one of the most powerful
corporations in the world is...

976
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:19,484
It's not something you take on lightly.
I mean, let's be clear about this.

977
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,084
Ford is just the first.

978
00:59:21,162 --> 00:59:23,960
We're gonna be bringing suits
against every automobile company

979
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,158
that's infringed on your
husband's patents.

980
00:59:26,234 --> 00:59:27,929
But Ford's number one.

981
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:31,665
Once they decided to put your
husband's invention on their car,

982
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:35,231
they gave a green light to
every auto company in the world.

983
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:37,504
"To hell with your husband,"
is what they said.

984
00:59:37,578 --> 00:59:41,412
Let me tell you something, Mrs. Kearns.
I believe in what I do.

985
00:59:41,983 --> 00:59:44,281
I believe in a little
thing called justice.

986
00:59:44,352 --> 00:59:47,219
These bastards think they can
walk all over anybody they want.

987
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:51,156
But we're here to tell them that
they can't, that it stops right here.

988
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:52,692
And I don't want you
to worry that this

989
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,093
is gonna take over your time or
your life, because that's my job.

990
00:59:56,164 --> 00:59:58,792
All right? That's why
I went to law school.

991
00:59:58,866 --> 01:00:01,699
Ian, this is Dr. Bob Kearns
and his wife, Phyllis.

992
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:03,134
This is Ian Meillor.
- How do you do?

993
01:00:03,204 --> 01:00:04,762
He's gonna be working
on this with me.

994
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:06,864
I just want to
thank both of you

995
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:08,875
for giving us the opportunity
to really make a difference here.

996
01:00:08,943 --> 01:00:11,503
One of the first items on our
agenda's gonna be discovery.

997
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:13,911
Yeah, I cannot wait to see
what they've got in those files.

998
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:17,314
We're gonna jump right into
it starting this afternoon.

999
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:19,950
Thank you very much.

1000
01:00:20,755 --> 01:00:23,485
And one other thing, I'd like to
stay as involved in this as possible.

1001
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:26,686
Of course. Of course, Dr. Kearns,
your help will be invaluable.

1002
01:00:26,761 --> 01:00:28,490
In fact, we have to
get... What is it?

1003
01:00:28,563 --> 01:00:29,168
Previck Auto.

1004
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:31,123
Yeah. We have to
get them on board ASAP.

1005
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:32,757
Think you can do
any good there?

1006
01:00:32,834 --> 01:00:33,926
I'll see.

1007
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:35,025
Very good to meet you.
Thanks for coming in.

1008
01:00:35,102 --> 01:00:36,694
Thank you so much.
We're relieved. Thank you.

1009
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:40,935
I mean, Jesus Christ,
Bob, it's just a windshield wiper.

1010
01:00:41,008 --> 01:00:46,844
To you, maybe. To that bartender up
there. But to me it's the Mona Lisa.

1011
01:00:46,914 --> 01:00:51,715
Well, you know what I mean. But I
just thought that when you got back,

1012
01:00:51,786 --> 01:00:53,879
you'd have a different perspective.

1013
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:56,253
I do. I'm handling
it differently.

1014
01:00:56,858 --> 01:00:58,951
Maybe you are.
I don't know.

1015
01:01:01,629 --> 01:01:02,687
So what are
you gonna do?

1016
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:07,200
I don't know. Maybe
I'm out of options.

1017
01:01:11,506 --> 01:01:13,303
Why don't you sue me?

1018
01:01:13,374 --> 01:01:17,310
<i>Kearns versus Previck.</i>
Got a nice sound to it.

1019
01:01:17,378 --> 01:01:19,346
Well, then
why wouldn't you?

1020
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:22,143
You've sued everybody else.
What's wrong with me?

1021
01:01:22,216 --> 01:01:25,481
Nothing. Other than that
I've known you for 25 years.

1022
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,220
Maybe you ought
to think about it.

1023
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,882
Get your lawyer to draft a
letter threatening to sue us.

1024
01:01:31,959 --> 01:01:35,554
If we're lucky, we'll get a
quick settlement. You understand?

1025
01:01:38,733 --> 01:01:40,997
Then you can have
your damn patents.

1026
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:44,664
Okay.

1027
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:48,038
Okay, but, Bob, you gotta forget
my name when it comes to Ford.

1028
01:01:48,109 --> 01:01:51,306
We're not gonna testify against them.
We're not gonna appear.

1029
01:01:51,379 --> 01:01:53,540
I mean it.
Well, say it.

1030
01:01:54,248 --> 01:01:57,411
You won't testify.
Previck won't be involved in any way.

1031
01:02:00,388 --> 01:02:01,753
All right.

1032
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:03,119
All right.

1033
01:02:05,326 --> 01:02:07,157
<i>Dear Dr. Kearns,</i>

I don't know.

1043

Yeah, we could
do that.

1044
01:02:34,956 --> 01:02:37,322
No, wait, there they are!
There they are. Phyllis, hi.

1045
01:02:37,391 --> 01:02:38,722
Hi. So good to see you.
- Hello, Bob.

1046
01:02:38,793 --> 01:02:41,762
Thank you, Jimmy. And would
you bring us a bottle of Moכt?

1047
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:42,853
Sure.

1048
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:45,626
Sit down, sit down.
- Sounds like good news.

1049
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,261
I'd say it is. In fact, you could
call this a celebration dinner.

1050
01:02:49,337 --> 01:02:51,032
This is exciting.

1051
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:55,297
Would you like to know who
called me on the phone today?

1052
01:02:55,576 --> 01:02:57,043
Charlie Defao.

1053
01:02:57,712 --> 01:02:59,475
Well, you may not
know that name,

1054
01:02:59,547 --> 01:03:03,074
but he's the man Macklin Tyler
calls when it's closing time.

1055
01:03:03,818 --> 01:03:07,276
And he's not a man to waste
his time on trivial matters.

1056
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:12,688
Bob, Phyllis,
I'm very pleased to report to you

1057
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:17,053
that Ford has offered
to settle for $250,000.

1058
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:22,029
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Oh, my gosh.

1059
01:03:22,103 --> 01:03:24,799
Settle? Now, what does that
mean in practical terms?

1060
01:03:24,872 --> 01:03:26,396
'Cause I thought we
weren't gonna pursue that.

1061
01:03:26,474 --> 01:03:28,203
No, that was
our agreement.

1062
01:03:28,275 --> 01:03:31,472
And we didn't do anything
to seek this settlement.

1063
01:03:31,946 --> 01:03:33,413
This is Ford's offer.

1064
01:03:34,649 --> 01:03:36,139
And, frankly, we're
a little surprised.

1065
01:03:36,217 --> 01:03:39,084
We're goddamned shocked,
excuse the language.

1066
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:40,347
Happily shocked,
though.

1067
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:44,983
Okay, but in this offer, do
they admit it was my invention?

1068
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,651
That they lied about it.

1069
01:03:46,727 --> 01:03:48,285
In a settlement
like this,

1070
01:03:48,362 --> 01:03:51,331
it's customary that both sides
are enjoined from commenting.

1071
01:03:51,399 --> 01:03:53,924
What that means is, they don't
say it wasn't your invention.

1072
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:57,095
No, absolutely not. No. No, no,
no, no. We wouldn't allow that.

1073
01:03:57,171 --> 01:03:58,798
But they won't say
they stole it.

1074
01:03:58,873 --> 01:04:01,740
No, but if they're
offering $250,000,

1075
01:04:01,809 --> 01:04:04,334
I think we can see
$350,000. Maybe four.

1076
01:04:04,412 --> 01:04:07,438
That's wonderful,
I think we'd like to think about it.

1077
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:09,039
Sure, of course.

1078
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:13,109
Phyllis is right. You should
think it over. It's been a rough 15 rounds.

1079
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:15,985
No, there's nothing to think about.
Tell them no.

1080
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:23,391
Bob, let's take a bird's
eye view for a moment, okay?

1081
01:04:23,898 --> 01:04:28,597
First off, if you're really thinking
of turning this down and going to court,

1082
01:04:28,669 --> 01:04:31,137
that's a very
expensive proposition.

1083
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:33,696
It's not a good...
It's not a good play.

1084
01:04:33,774 --> 01:04:36,208
I'm not talking about
play, Mr. Lawson.

1085
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:39,277
Let me just tell you something
for future reference, Bob.

1086
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:42,406
I don't appreciate the
way you're talking to me.

1087
01:04:43,484 --> 01:04:45,975
You don't have the most
charming personality.

1088
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:49,284
And at least four times a
week, I get a call from you

1089
01:04:49,356 --> 01:04:50,687
telling me what
the law is.

1090
01:04:50,758 --> 01:04:53,591
You're not a lawyer,
Dr. Kearns.

1091
01:04:53,661 --> 01:05:00,066
Now, from a real lawyer, from a 45-year
member of the bar, I can tell you,

1092
01:05:00,701 --> 01:05:04,262
this firm has spent more time on
your case than you can comprehend.

1093
01:05:04,338 --> 01:05:07,034
Maybe. But you're getting
money for this case.

1094
01:05:07,108 --> 01:05:08,336
Only if we settle.

1095
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:10,934
Bob, think it over.
It's essential.

1096
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:15,380
Three, maybe $400,000, it's
enough to change your whole life.

1097
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:16,507
I'm sure it would.

1098
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:17,881
It certainly seems
like a lot.

1099
01:05:17,952 --> 01:05:18,941
It doesn't matter.

1100
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:21,886
Look, I'm sure you men think
this is a bunch of hogwash,

1101
01:05:21,956 --> 01:05:24,356
but this is about
more than money.

1102
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:27,052
I always thought I was put here
on this earth for a purpose.

1103
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:30,894
I thought it was to be an engineer.
Or maybe an inventor.

1104
01:05:30,965 --> 01:05:33,456
But that's not it.
And now I know what it is.

1105
01:05:33,534 --> 01:05:35,968
God put you here to sue
the Ford Motor Company?

1106
01:05:36,036 --> 01:05:39,597
Look, I brought these here, thinking
that you had different ideas.

1107
01:05:39,673 --> 01:05:42,642
Edwin Armstrong
invented the FM radio.

1108
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,337
Somehow R.C.A. ended
up with the patent.

1109
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:48,108
He jumped out a 13-story window.
This was a good man!

1110
01:05:48,182 --> 01:05:51,948
He was an inventor.
And, look, I have letters from people.

1111
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:54,419
People who've had their
ideas taken from them.

1112
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:57,548
They've heard about us. They're in
their backyards and their garages,

1113
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:00,025
and they're counting on me.
Please, just look at this.

1114
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:02,358
Thank you very much. I really don't
need to look at these right now.

1115
01:06:02,429 --> 01:06:04,795
Let's just get to
the point. Okay?

1116
01:06:04,865 --> 01:06:07,959
This settlement offer
is very, very generous.

1117
01:06:08,035 --> 01:06:10,162
And if we did get
this before a jury,

1118
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:11,864
if we prevailed,

1119
01:06:11,939 --> 01:06:15,705
if the jury gave you the
recognition you so obviously crave...

1120
01:06:15,776 --> 01:06:16,834
That's insulting.

1121
01:06:16,911 --> 01:06:19,379
...it is doubtful that
you would do any better

1122
01:06:19,446 --> 01:06:21,380
than you would right now
with this settlement.

1123
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:24,781
And whatever happened to this little
thing called justice you talked about?

1124
01:06:24,852 --> 01:06:28,447
This is justice, Bob. This is how
justice is dispensed in this country.

1125
01:06:28,522 --> 01:06:29,682
With checkbooks.

1126
01:06:29,757 --> 01:06:32,988
There are no brass bands, you know.
There are no ticker tape parades.

1127
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,153
The mayor doesn't give
you the key to the city

1128
01:06:35,229 --> 01:06:37,129
and call you a hero.
You get a check.

1129
01:06:37,198 --> 01:06:41,134
And that check makes the lives of
you and your family a little easier.

1130
01:06:41,202 --> 01:06:43,898
A little more pleasant.
It's that simple.

1131
01:06:43,971 --> 01:06:47,304
Well, I'll make it simple, too.
Forget the check.

1132
01:06:47,942 --> 01:06:51,309
Get an admission that they stole it
and give me the right to manufacture

1133
01:06:51,378 --> 01:06:54,541
my wipers and
this'll all be over.

1134
01:06:54,882 --> 01:06:59,945
Bob, since I bought this wasted champagne,
just indulge me for a moment, okay?

1135
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:03,717
Just think about
this scenario.

1136
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:07,056
Your lawsuit is over.
But you know what?

1137
01:07:07,127 --> 01:07:09,527
You're no longer
a young man. Why?

1138
01:07:09,597 --> 01:07:12,498
Because you're fighting a
corporation that, that does not

1139
01:07:12,566 --> 01:07:15,558
know the meaning
of years. Or money.

1140
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:20,768
They'll bury you with motions,
injunctions, countersuits.

1141
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:25,073
They'll drown you in so many irrelevant
documents that you'll wake up,

1142
01:07:25,145 --> 01:07:27,739
with cold sweats.

1143
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:30,409
And five years from now,
you won't be any closer

1144
01:07:30,484 --> 01:07:33,317
to seeing the inside of a
courtroom than you are right now.

1145
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:35,514
Your hair will turn gray.

1146
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:38,149
Life will pass you by.
And for what?

1147
01:07:39,159 --> 01:07:42,560
Go home and talk about this with
your lovely wife. Sleep on it.

1148
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:47,963
And then make your decision. And if you
make the decision that I hope you will,

1149
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:50,462
this'll all be over
in a few days.

1150
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:56,175
I'll show you what we got here
in the stacks on patent law,

1151
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:59,269
but there's a load more over
at the university library.

1152
01:07:59,713 --> 01:08:01,476
And here you go.

1153
01:08:02,383 --> 01:08:05,443
Oh, so it's all this?

1154
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,783
Nope, and those shelves, too.

1155
01:08:07,855 --> 01:08:12,690
And that one there.
And half of that one, I think.

1156
01:08:14,461 --> 01:08:15,723
Thanks, Louis.

1157
01:08:16,196 --> 01:08:17,493
You're welcome.

1158
01:08:26,206 --> 01:08:28,003
I'm sorry it's so late.

1159
01:08:28,075 --> 01:08:30,566
Uh-huh. I couldn't sleep.

1160
01:08:31,946 --> 01:08:34,915
Well, no turning into me.

1161
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:40,586
No turning into me.

1162
01:08:41,522 --> 01:08:43,513
Honey, I think we
should take the deal.

1163
01:08:45,993 --> 01:08:48,894
Well, I know you do.
But I don't.

1164
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,198
Robert, it's gone on
long enough now.

1165
01:08:52,266 --> 01:08:53,631
We could really use the money.

1166
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:55,191
Since when has this
been about money?

1167
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:57,703
It's not just about the money.
It's about our family.

1168
01:08:57,771 --> 01:08:59,966
Well, why do you
think I'm doing this?

1169
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,600
How am I supposed to teach my
kids about doing the right thing

1170
01:09:02,676 --> 01:09:04,200
if I let these guys
get away with this?

1171
01:09:04,278 --> 01:09:06,246
I'm not sure that's exactly
what we're teaching them.

1172
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:08,281
They like this.
The kids like being involved in it.

1173
01:09:08,349 --> 01:09:12,149
No, they just don't want to let you down.
I don't want to let you down.

1174
01:09:17,224 --> 01:09:18,486
We're fine.

1175
01:09:22,062 --> 01:09:25,623
It's like he said.
They have all the time. We don't.

1176
01:09:26,633 --> 01:09:29,158
We're gonna be fine.

1177
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:54,091
Is that the Journal?
- Yeah, 1949.

1178
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:56,322
<i>Gerald Reed vs.</i>
<i>Lansing Tech.</i>

1179
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,090
Seems relevant, huh?

1180
01:09:58,165 --> 01:09:59,655
Seems like it to me.

1181
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:03,394
Dr. Kearns,
I'm really glad you're doing this.

1182
01:10:03,604 --> 01:10:07,597
<i>The truth is, if you don't fight,
the rest of us will never stand a chance.</i>

1183
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:18,475
Hey.
- Hey.

1184
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:25,118
How you doing?

1185
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:27,289
Good. Mr. Lawson called.

1186
01:10:28,362 --> 01:10:31,354
Okay. Where are the kids?

1187
01:10:31,432 --> 01:10:32,956
I took them to Deb's.

1188
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:40,666
Okay. I'm gonna grab a...

1189
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,369
Phyllis...

1190
01:10:47,448 --> 01:10:48,745
I wrote you a letter.

1191
01:10:51,452 --> 01:10:54,046
And I threw it away, 'cause
I don't know what to say.

1192
01:10:54,888 --> 01:10:57,413
It's just become
so destructive.

1193
01:10:57,491 --> 01:11:00,949
Okay, listen.
I heard everything you said last week,

1194
01:11:01,028 --> 01:11:03,394
and I agree with it.
I'm trying to change...

1195
01:11:03,464 --> 01:11:06,228
No, I know.
I know you want to change.

1196
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,427
I don't think you know how.

1197
01:11:08,535 --> 01:11:09,934
You can't.
- This is just how it has to be.

1198
01:11:10,003 --> 01:11:10,992
Phyllis...

1199
01:11:11,071 --> 01:11:12,231
I'm leaving.
- No.

1200
01:11:12,306 --> 01:11:15,901
Because I think this is the right thing.
Please understand.

1201
01:11:16,176 --> 01:11:19,339
This has overwhelmed us.
- Goddamn it, I need you right now!

1202
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:22,210
You've stopped supporting
me ever since I got home!

1203
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:25,251
You don't believe in this case anymore.
It's not, this isn't fair.

1204
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:27,480
It's not fair!
- It's not fair to me.

1205
01:11:27,588 --> 01:11:31,285
There are seven other people in this
house, and you just don't get it.

1206
01:11:31,358 --> 01:11:34,486
We're close. We're so close.
They're calling us right now!

1207
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:37,689
Honey. No.
- Phyllis, no, Phyllis.

1208
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:40,322
Come here.
We're okay.

1209
01:11:42,936 --> 01:11:44,836
I can't do it without you.

1210
01:11:44,905 --> 01:11:46,532
You're gonna be fine.

1211
01:11:47,441 --> 01:11:48,669
I can fix it.

1212
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:55,607
Okay. You fix it.
And then we'll see, okay?

1213
01:11:57,184 --> 01:11:59,175
For now, this is best.

1214
01:11:59,586 --> 01:12:00,985
You still love me?

1215
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:04,855
I love you.

1216
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:15,226
What did Lawson say?

1217
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:19,671
He officially
resigned the case.

1218
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,395
Yeah, so, I'm going
back to my room real quick,

1219
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:26,530
and then I'll meet
you at the library.

1220
01:13:26,607 --> 01:13:27,904
Dennis?

1221
01:13:29,676 --> 01:13:30,734
Dad.

1222
01:13:32,512 --> 01:13:34,173
I'll catch up with you guys.

1223
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:35,977
Yeah, see you later.

1224
01:13:38,352 --> 01:13:40,980
Hey. What's going on?

1225
01:13:41,054 --> 01:13:42,851
Can we get
a cup of coffee?

1226
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:45,850
Sure. Yeah.

1227
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:50,085
It's a long article, Dad.

1228
01:13:50,163 --> 01:13:52,188
Just keep reading.

1229
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:53,563
Where?
- Well, down here.

1230
01:13:53,634 --> 01:13:54,965
Look. Okay?

1231
01:13:56,136 --> 01:13:57,660
"Among other things,
the new courts are

1232
01:13:57,738 --> 01:13:59,729
"designed to free up
the logjam of patent cases

1233
01:13:59,806 --> 01:14:01,433
"that have been clogging
the federal courts."

1234
01:14:01,508 --> 01:14:04,739
Do you know what that means?
We can actually get to court.

1235
01:14:05,545 --> 01:14:09,242
They've been waiting me out.
They're waiting for my patents to expire.

1236
01:14:09,316 --> 01:14:12,547
And if we can get them to court
soon, they lose a very big advantage.

1237
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:16,316
How soon?
- Months. Months, not years.

1238
01:14:18,692 --> 01:14:20,353
That's great, Dad.

1239
01:14:21,995 --> 01:14:24,793
Well, I'm not ready yet.

1240
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:27,197
And I can't do this by myself.

1241
01:14:29,336 --> 01:14:30,735
Hey.

1242
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:33,034
We used to talk about the Kearns
Corporation. You remember that?

1243
01:14:33,106 --> 01:14:34,437
That was a joke, Dad.

1244
01:14:34,508 --> 01:14:37,773
Not to me.
That was never a joke.

1245
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:40,335
We weren't a corporation.
We were a family.

1246
01:14:40,814 --> 01:14:42,839
We haven't even been that.

1247
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:49,256
I need help, Dennis. I submitted
a request to Ford for one document.

1248
01:14:50,424 --> 01:14:55,225
They sent me back 357 pages. I had to read
through every one to find the relevant page.

1249
01:14:56,797 --> 01:15:01,393
That is all you care about.
That's all you ever cared about, Dad.

1250
01:15:02,736 --> 01:15:05,637
Thanks for the coffee.
I gotta get to class.

1251
01:15:07,507 --> 01:15:09,634
Okay. I'm fine.

1252
01:15:09,776 --> 01:15:12,870
Go ahead. Go to your class.
I don't need the help.

1253
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,764
Can I help you?

1254
01:15:42,342 --> 01:15:43,570
I hope so.

1255
01:15:44,945 --> 01:15:48,847
Bob Kearns?
My name is Charlie Defao.

1256
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,340
What do you want?

1257
01:15:51,485 --> 01:15:56,252
A conversation. We tried calling, but
you don't answer your phone much, do you?

1258
01:15:57,457 --> 01:15:58,617
Who are you?

1259
01:15:58,692 --> 01:16:01,126
I'm here at the request
of the Ford Motor Company.

1260
01:16:01,194 --> 01:16:03,856
You think we could go inside
and discuss a few things?

1261
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:06,057
Discuss what?

1262
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:08,363
How about putting
all this behind you?

1263
01:16:09,102 --> 01:16:10,660
So you can move
on with your life.

1264
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:14,503
And so, frankly, Ford can stop
devoting so much time to your concerns.

1265
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:17,372
Well, they can if they want.

1266
01:16:17,444 --> 01:16:18,570
They want.

1267
01:16:18,645 --> 01:16:21,944
And to prove it, they've authorized me
to come here and offer you a lot of money.

1268
01:16:22,015 --> 01:16:24,313
On top of your legal expenses.

1269
01:16:26,853 --> 01:16:27,842
I accept.

1270
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:30,884
Excellent.

1271
01:16:30,957 --> 01:16:32,356
On one condition.

1272
01:16:33,627 --> 01:16:37,825
As long as Ford takes out an ad in
the <i>Detroit Free Press,</i>

1273
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:39,559
saying that they stole
Robert Kearns' invention,

1274
01:16:39,633 --> 01:16:42,932
and have done everything they
can to deny me my day in court.

1275
01:16:44,504 --> 01:16:46,404
The only problem with that

1276
01:16:48,241 --> 01:16:50,334
is that it'd
be a lie. Huh?

1277
01:16:51,511 --> 01:16:53,706
To say they stole your
invention would be an insult.

1278
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,147
To every engineer, stockholder, every
single man and woman at the company.

1279
01:16:57,217 --> 01:17:01,017
Bob, Ford is genuinely sorry
if you've ever felt mistreated.

1280
01:17:02,055 --> 01:17:04,853
And to resolve the situation, they're
willing to take the first step.

1281
01:17:04,925 --> 01:17:06,790
A big step.
Frankly, an amazing step.

1282
01:17:07,894 --> 01:17:09,418
A million dollar step.

1283
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:14,892
I have work to do and
you're keeping me from it.

1284
01:17:15,902 --> 01:17:18,530
I hate to use these words,
but in this case,

1285
01:17:18,605 --> 01:17:21,165
this actually is a take
it or leave it offer.

1286
01:17:24,511 --> 01:17:27,241
Bob, you don't want
this in court, okay?

1287
01:17:29,616 --> 01:17:32,551
Going to the law library's not
gonna make you a lawyer, Bob.

1288
01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:36,487
Look, I'm gonna leave you my card,
okay? I've put my home number on it.

1289
01:17:36,723 --> 01:17:39,692
So I want you to call
me anytime. Day or night.

1290
01:17:40,961 --> 01:17:42,258
Doesn't matter.

1291
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:46,132
Just call me. I'll be waiting
for your call, Bob, okay?

1292
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,432
Just not for long.

1293
01:17:51,571 --> 01:17:52,560
Asshole.

1294
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:57,699
Asshole.

1295
01:17:59,145 --> 01:18:01,545
There he is. Hey, Dad!

1296
01:18:01,648 --> 01:18:03,513
Hi, honey.

1297
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:06,011
Hey, Dennis.

1298
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,747
Hey, Dad.

1299
01:18:08,822 --> 01:18:10,312
You want to come in?

1300
01:18:11,124 --> 01:18:13,752
No, I'll see you, okay?

1301
01:18:14,227 --> 01:18:17,355
Okay. How are you?

1302
01:18:17,597 --> 01:18:19,087
I'm good.
- Yeah?

1303
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,689
How you doing?

1304
01:18:21,234 --> 01:18:22,997
Dennis, hold up!

1305
01:18:27,173 --> 01:18:28,538
Hey.
- Hey.

1306
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,974
Thanks for bringing
Kathy over.

1307
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:33,535
You're welcome.

1308
01:18:33,914 --> 01:18:37,350
Yeah. Thanks for bringing
her over the last time, too.

1309
01:18:37,417 --> 01:18:38,679
You know?

1310
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:43,715
I know you've carried a pretty
big load for the family, Dennis.

1311
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,281
It's okay, Dad.

1312
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:49,658
I just want you to know
you're pretty good at it.

1313
01:18:50,597 --> 01:18:53,088
You're better than
most guys I know.

1314
01:18:53,266 --> 01:18:55,166
Thank you.

1315
01:18:58,872 --> 01:19:00,100
I'll see you.

1316
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:02,130
See you.

1317
01:19:04,744 --> 01:19:06,541
Everything all right?

1318
01:19:06,913 --> 01:19:09,381
What do you want to do?

1319
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:11,849
Don't you have a lot of work?
I just figured I'd help out.

1320
01:19:11,918 --> 01:19:14,113
Hey, you work too much.

1321
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:18,019
Too much typing.
Let's, go have some fun.

1322
01:19:19,192 --> 01:19:22,992
I hear there's a... There's a
car show at the Historical Museum.

1323
01:19:23,063 --> 01:19:24,428
We could...

1324
01:19:24,497 --> 01:19:26,522
Wow! That is something
different.

1325
01:19:26,633 --> 01:19:27,759
Oh, that's very funny.

1326
01:20:21,721 --> 01:20:22,847
Hey, Dad.

1327
01:20:22,922 --> 01:20:23,911
Oh!

1328
01:20:25,925 --> 01:20:27,859
You scared the hell out of me.

1329
01:20:28,461 --> 01:20:29,826
Sorry.

1330
01:20:30,563 --> 01:20:31,723
Yeah.

1331
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:40,030
I got some coffees for us.
Looks like a long night.

1332
01:20:44,044 --> 01:20:47,946
Thank you.
Uh, yeah, son.

1333
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:51,810
Right. Okay.

1334
01:20:52,052 --> 01:20:56,045
Mr. Finley, Dr. Kearns,
please step up into the well.

1335
01:20:57,290 --> 01:21:00,344
Civil action, <i>Robert Kearns
vs. the Ford Motor Company,</i>

1336
01:21:00,345 --> 01:21:01,556
will begin on August 14th.

1337
01:21:01,628 --> 01:21:05,587
United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan.

1338
01:21:05,665 --> 01:21:09,658
So, Dr. Kearns, I'm not
sure why, since you seem like

1339
01:21:09,736 --> 01:21:13,763
a reasonable man, but I understand
you'll be representing yourself.

1340
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:18,634
Yes, sir.
My son Dennis will be helping me out.

1341
01:21:19,212 --> 01:21:24,115
Okay, then if you're up for it, let's make
it a good clean fight, shall we, gentlemen?

1342
01:21:24,784 --> 01:21:26,718
Of course we will, Your Honor.

1343
01:21:27,754 --> 01:21:29,278
I don't understand.

1344
01:21:29,355 --> 01:21:31,653
It's just an expression,
Dr. Kearns.

1345
01:21:32,692 --> 01:21:35,320
August 14th.
We'll see you then.

1346
01:21:35,495 --> 01:21:37,326
Thank you very much,
Your Honor.

1347
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:39,331
Thank you very much,
Your Honor.

1348
01:21:43,169 --> 01:21:44,500
How's Mom?

1349
01:21:45,138 --> 01:21:46,298
She's fine.

1350
01:21:48,341 --> 01:21:49,774
You want the dates on these?

1351
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:53,034
Yeah.

1352
01:21:53,113 --> 01:21:54,307
Quit your bitching.
You're only carrying one.

1353
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,369
Tough.

1354
01:21:55,448 --> 01:21:57,313
Hey, put those by the wall.
- There you go.

1355
01:21:57,383 --> 01:21:59,146
Is it Chrysler?
- Hell if I know.

1356
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:02,848
Watch your language.
She'll be coming to the trial, right?

1357
01:22:03,223 --> 01:22:05,987
Look, Dad, I told you not to
get your hopes up about Mom.

1358
01:22:06,059 --> 01:22:09,426
Well, what does that mean?

1359
01:22:09,863 --> 01:22:11,694
You know what that means.

1360
01:22:12,632 --> 01:22:15,260
No, I really don't.

1361
01:22:15,902 --> 01:22:18,462
She's busy.
She's doing a lot of substituting.

1362
01:22:24,644 --> 01:22:26,509
Is she seeing someone?

1363
01:22:28,248 --> 01:22:30,648
It's been four years, Dad.

1364
01:22:30,717 --> 01:22:32,947
Well, that's not
an answer, Kath.

1365
01:22:36,022 --> 01:22:41,619
Well, anyway, it's okay.
Just let her know. It'd be nice.

1366
01:22:41,728 --> 01:22:42,888
Mmm.

1367
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:54,036
What a piece of crap.

1368
01:22:54,107 --> 01:22:55,540
It's perfect.

1369
01:23:07,587 --> 01:23:12,490
Hi, Phyllis. Um, I know it's
late. The kids are asleep,

1370
01:23:14,093 --> 01:23:17,893
and I think I've been putting off
this call hoping you would be, too.

1371
01:23:18,331 --> 01:23:23,564
I just wanted you to know
that the trial starts tomorrow.

1372
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,901
Okay. Good-bye.

1373
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:46,617
Hey, Dad!

1374
01:23:46,693 --> 01:23:48,661
Hey, Dad wait up!

1375
01:23:48,728 --> 01:23:50,161
Hey. How are you?

1376
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:51,561
Good. How are you?
- Hello, Patrick.

1377
01:23:51,631 --> 01:23:53,724
Hey.
- I'm doing pretty good.

1378
01:23:56,502 --> 01:23:58,663
You get some rest?
- Oh, a little bit.

1379
01:23:58,838 --> 01:24:03,537
Most of the testimony you'll be hearing at
this trial will be highly technical in nature.

1380
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:07,637
Although you may have noticed a
less technical piece of evidence

1381
01:24:07,747 --> 01:24:10,272
in the form of half
of an automobile.

1382
01:24:11,317 --> 01:24:14,548
The plaintiff in this case
is Dr. Robert Kearns.

1383
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:19,524
Dr. Kearns charges that the Ford Motor Company
infringed five patents that he holds.

1384
01:24:19,626 --> 01:24:22,891
If you decide in Dr. Kearns'
favor, you will also decide

1385
01:24:22,996 --> 01:24:26,056
what damages, if any,
are due to Dr. Kearns.

1386
01:24:26,766 --> 01:24:30,998
Dr. Kearns has voluntarily chosen
to represent himself at this trial.

1387
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:35,541
You are not to draw any inferences
either for or against Dr. Kearns,

1388
01:24:35,808 --> 01:24:38,652
simply because he
is representing himself.

1389
01:24:38,653 --> 01:24:39,710
Yes, Dr. Kearns?

1390
01:24:41,014 --> 01:24:45,713
I just wanted to thank you for
allowing me to represent myself

1391
01:24:45,785 --> 01:24:47,946
and introduce my son,
Dennis Kearns.

1392
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:53,484
Is that all, Dr. Kearns?

1393
01:24:53,993 --> 01:24:57,588
I appreciate the jury giving their
time to the community like this.

1394
01:24:58,064 --> 01:25:00,965
The jury is the
conscience of the community.

1395
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:05,897
Are you finished?

1396
01:25:06,205 --> 01:25:09,572
You might be more comfortable
seated, don't you think?

1397
01:25:10,643 --> 01:25:14,579
Please keep in mind you're not to discuss
what you hear at this trial with anyone else.

1398
01:25:14,681 --> 01:25:17,115
Not amongst yourselves, not in the
jury room, not in the hallway...

1399
01:25:17,183 --> 01:25:21,847
Now, this array of electronic parts
and this combination of circuitry

1400
01:25:21,921 --> 01:25:26,119
has been used by American auto
manufacturers since the 1950s.

1401
01:25:26,459 --> 01:25:29,223
Obviously since Ford
engineers designed it,

1402
01:25:29,295 --> 01:25:31,923
they had knowledge of it long before
their first meeting with Dr. Kearns...

1403
01:25:31,998 --> 01:25:34,626
Would you agree that Dr. Kearns
was the first person in the world,

1404
01:25:34,701 --> 01:25:36,430
to your knowledge,
to propose that combination?

1405
01:25:36,502 --> 01:25:40,336
I believe it's possible that
it was Motorola and Ranco.

1406
01:25:40,773 --> 01:25:41,899
They may have.
<i>The motor makes one</i>

1407
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:45,035
<i>revolution to get one wipe out
of 360 degrees. It's very simple.</i>

1408
01:25:45,111 --> 01:25:46,510
<i>We worked on that</i>
<i>for two weeks.</i>

1409
01:25:46,579 --> 01:25:49,810
<i>Well, certainly it is important to
understand that within the Ford organization,</i>

1410
01:25:49,882 --> 01:25:51,213
<i>it takes some time</i>
<i>to get written...</i>

1411
01:25:51,284 --> 01:25:54,219
<i>Well, when you start the car,
the transistors come on automatically</i>

1412
01:25:54,287 --> 01:25:56,915
<i>and supply 50 times</i>
<i>as much current.</i>

1413
01:25:57,223 --> 01:26:01,353
To reiterate, you've worked in the
automobile industry for well over 20 years

1414
01:26:01,427 --> 01:26:05,295
and you've been an executive at the company
for a number of those years, correct?

1415
01:26:05,365 --> 01:26:06,957
That's correct.

1416
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:11,500
Mr. Tyler, to be clear,
did you ever tell Mr. Kearns

1417
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:14,802
that he had, quote,
"Won the wiper competition"?

1418
01:26:15,675 --> 01:26:20,703
It doesn't sound much like me, so, no, I
really don't recall making that comment.

1419
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:24,240
I mean, I certainly tried to be encouraging
to Mr. Kearns. I respected the man.

1420
01:26:24,317 --> 01:26:27,809
Hell, I still do, but to say
that there was a competition

1421
01:26:27,887 --> 01:26:30,981
is, I think,
pretty big stretch.

1422
01:26:31,057 --> 01:26:33,548
I should also point out that
Mr. Kearns's apparent intention

1423
01:26:33,626 --> 01:26:35,890
was to manufacture
his device himself.

1424
01:26:36,396 --> 01:26:38,626
That simply would have
been impossible for us.

1425
01:26:38,698 --> 01:26:42,065
So, to be clear, there's no
chance that Ford would have ever

1426
01:26:42,135 --> 01:26:46,731
entertained the notion of Mr. Kearns
manufacturing his own windshield wiper?

1427
01:26:46,806 --> 01:26:48,603
No chance.

1428
01:26:48,674 --> 01:26:52,576
Ford putting its name in the
hands of an inexperienced supplier?

1429
01:26:53,446 --> 01:26:55,573
That would have been a
disaster waiting to happen.

1430
01:26:55,648 --> 01:26:58,276
Thank you, Mr. Tyler.

1431
01:27:01,154 --> 01:27:03,679
Dr. Kearns?
Your witness.

1432
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:17,360
Mr. Tyler, did you ever
ask Dr. Kearns to

1433
01:27:17,437 --> 01:27:20,770
come up with a cost
unit basis for his wiper?

1434
01:27:21,374 --> 01:27:24,207
I don't recall specifically
everything I asked him.

1435
01:27:24,277 --> 01:27:26,108
I may have asked him.

1436
01:27:26,179 --> 01:27:29,410
Well, why would you
have asked for that?

1437
01:27:29,482 --> 01:27:34,146
If I did, it would have been because Mr. Kearns
was going on and on about manufacturing,

1438
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,785
and I would have been trying
to point out the impossibility.

1439
01:27:38,024 --> 01:27:40,151
Well, wouldn't asking a
question like that...

1440
01:27:40,226 --> 01:27:44,356
Unless you have a document to hand to
the witness please stay at the lectern.

1441
01:27:45,031 --> 01:27:48,467
Uh, what...

1442
01:27:48,534 --> 01:27:53,471
Well, wouldn't asking a question
like that imply a contract or a,

1443
01:27:53,539 --> 01:27:55,439
an agreement of some sort?

1444
01:27:55,508 --> 01:27:59,444
No, not really. Uh, I'd say it's no
more a commitment to buy his wipers

1445
01:27:59,512 --> 01:28:03,744
than I would be committed to buy
someone's tie if I asked him how much it cost.

1446
01:28:05,952 --> 01:28:08,921
Did you ever ask Dr. Kearns
how much his tie cost?

1447
01:28:09,722 --> 01:28:13,214
No, not that I recall, and I'm
not sure he was even wearing one.

1448
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:16,056
But you did ask him how
much his wiper cost, right?

1449
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:19,394
Like I said, in a rhetorical
way, it may have been possible.

1450
01:28:19,799 --> 01:28:22,529
So it's not the same as
a tie at all, is it?

1451
01:28:23,503 --> 01:28:24,970
I'm sorry. What?

1452
01:28:25,037 --> 01:28:26,129
Thank you.

1453
01:28:29,075 --> 01:28:32,169
You have a Ph.D in electronic
engineering, is that correct?

1454
01:28:32,245 --> 01:28:35,146
Uh, that's correct. I've taught
for the past several years...

1455
01:28:35,214 --> 01:28:37,808
No, that's fine, sir. Your credentials
are already part of the record.

1456
01:28:37,884 --> 01:28:42,844
Now, when you said earlier that Mr.
Kearns didn't create anything new,

1457
01:28:42,922 --> 01:28:44,822
could you explain what
you meant by that?

1458
01:28:44,891 --> 01:28:46,984
Yes. As you can see,

1459
01:28:47,126 --> 01:28:50,323
Dr. Kearns's basic
unit consists of a capacitor

1460
01:28:50,396 --> 01:28:52,921
a variable resistor
and a transistor.

1461
01:28:53,065 --> 01:28:55,693
Now, these are basic building
blocks in electronics.

1462
01:28:55,768 --> 01:28:58,669
You can find them
in any catalog.

1463
01:28:58,738 --> 01:29:03,471
All Mr. Kearns did was to arrange
them in a new pattern, you might say.

1464
01:29:03,543 --> 01:29:08,708
And that, that's not the same thing
as inventing something new, however.

1465
01:29:08,848 --> 01:29:11,214
Did Mr. Kearns
invent the transistor?

1466
01:29:11,684 --> 01:29:13,311
No, sir, he did not.

1467
01:29:13,386 --> 01:29:15,752
Did Mr. Kearns
invent the capacitor?

1468
01:29:15,821 --> 01:29:17,755
Again, no, he did not.

1469
01:29:17,823 --> 01:29:19,950
Did Mr. Kearns invent
the variable resistor?

1470
01:29:20,026 --> 01:29:21,960
No, he did not.
- Thank you, Professor.

1471
01:29:22,028 --> 01:29:23,757
You may step
down, Professor Chapman.

1472
01:29:23,829 --> 01:29:25,558
We will resume
testimony after lunch.

1473
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,292
Dr. Kearns, your
cross-examination, please.

1474
01:29:32,338 --> 01:29:33,327
Dr. Kearns.

1475
01:29:33,406 --> 01:29:34,896
Yes, sir.

1476
01:29:41,948 --> 01:29:43,108
Oh.

1477
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:55,026
I have here a book.
It's by Charles Dickens.

1478
01:29:55,094 --> 01:29:57,255
It's called
<i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

1479
01:29:58,064 --> 01:29:59,622
Have you, have you
ever read this book?

1480
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:01,826
Objection, Your Honor.
It's not relevant.

1481
01:30:01,901 --> 01:30:03,801
Your Honor, please,
if I could just continue?

1482
01:30:03,869 --> 01:30:05,769
How long will it take to
get to the point, Doctor?

1483
01:30:05,838 --> 01:30:07,237
Not very long at all.

1484
01:30:07,306 --> 01:30:09,433
Okay. Let's see
what happens.

1485
01:30:10,276 --> 01:30:11,436
Have you ever read this?

1486
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:14,377
Yes. Read it in high
school. Very good book.

1487
01:30:14,547 --> 01:30:19,177
Yes, it is. I'd like to read you
the first, few words, if I may.

1488
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:22,710
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,

1489
01:30:22,788 --> 01:30:27,054
"it was the age of wisdom, it
was the age of foolishness."

1490
01:30:27,426 --> 01:30:29,553
Let's start with the
first word, "It."

1491
01:30:29,629 --> 01:30:31,824
Did Charles Dickens
create that word?

1492
01:30:31,964 --> 01:30:33,989
No.

1493
01:30:34,066 --> 01:30:35,624
No.
What about "was"?

1494
01:30:35,735 --> 01:30:38,966
Your Honor, is Mr. Kearns gonna
go through the whole dictionary?

1495
01:30:39,038 --> 01:30:42,235
Please, if I could just
continue. I do have a point.

1496
01:30:44,377 --> 01:30:46,208
You may answer the question.

1497
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:47,439
No.

1498
01:30:47,513 --> 01:30:48,741
"The"?

1499
01:30:48,814 --> 01:30:50,145
No.
- "Best"?

1500
01:30:50,216 --> 01:30:51,911
No.
- "Times"?

1501
01:30:52,285 --> 01:30:54,515
Look. I got a dictionary here.

1502
01:30:54,687 --> 01:30:57,281
I haven't checked,
but I would guess that

1503
01:30:57,356 --> 01:31:00,416
every word that's in this book
can be found in this dictionary.

1504
01:31:00,493 --> 01:31:02,222
Well, I suspect that's
probably true.

1505
01:31:02,295 --> 01:31:04,855
Okay, so then you agree
that there's not,

1506
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:08,195
probably a single
new word in this book.

1507
01:31:08,601 --> 01:31:11,695
Well, I don't know,
but that's probably true.

1508
01:31:12,204 --> 01:31:16,470
All Charles Dickens did was arrange them
into a new pattern, isn't that right?

1509
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:21,037
Well, I admit I haven't,
thought about it in that way.

1510
01:31:21,347 --> 01:31:24,111
But Dickens did create
something new, didn't he?

1511
01:31:24,183 --> 01:31:25,616
By using words.

1512
01:31:25,685 --> 01:31:29,348
The only tools that
were available to him.

1513
01:31:32,091 --> 01:31:36,653
Just as almost all inventors in
history have had to use the tools that

1514
01:31:36,729 --> 01:31:39,289
were available to them.

1515
01:31:39,365 --> 01:31:42,459
Telephones, space satellites
all of these were made from

1516
01:31:42,535 --> 01:31:45,368
parts that already existed,
correct, Professor?

1517
01:31:45,871 --> 01:31:48,362
Parts that you might buy
out of a catalog.

1518
01:31:49,008 --> 01:31:50,498
Technically that's true,
yes, but that does...

1519
01:31:50,576 --> 01:31:52,567
No further questions.

1520
01:31:52,645 --> 01:31:54,840
You may step
down, Professor Chapman.

1521
01:31:57,283 --> 01:32:00,081
Dad, how old do you
think that Finley guy is?

1522
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:01,786
I don't know.

1523
01:32:01,854 --> 01:32:03,082
Hey, Dr. Kearns?

1524
01:32:03,155 --> 01:32:04,383
I brought some guys
from the inventors club.

1525
01:32:04,457 --> 01:32:07,255
Oh, that's great, Louis.
- See you in there.

1526
01:32:08,394 --> 01:32:09,383
Hey, Dad!

1527
01:32:09,462 --> 01:32:11,327
Oh, there you are.
- Hey.

1528
01:32:11,797 --> 01:32:13,355
How you guys doing?
- Hey. Good. How are you doing?

1529
01:32:13,432 --> 01:32:14,592
Hi, Dad.
- Good.

1530
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:16,134
Hey.

1531
01:32:16,902 --> 01:32:17,891
How are you?

1532
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:19,437
Yeah, good. Good.

1533
01:32:19,505 --> 01:32:22,235
I guess I should be thinking
about going to law school.

1534
01:32:22,308 --> 01:32:24,071
They said it's been
going great. I'm glad.

1535
01:32:24,143 --> 01:32:26,270
Yeah. Thank you for coming.

1536
01:32:26,679 --> 01:32:28,840
Sure.
Go. Go.

1537
01:32:28,914 --> 01:32:30,040
Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

1538
01:32:30,116 --> 01:32:31,208
A minute, Dennis.

1539
01:32:31,283 --> 01:32:34,309
Okay. Bye, sweets. Okay.
- Okay. Bye, Mom, see you later.

1540
01:32:35,821 --> 01:32:37,812
All right, let's go.

1541
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:40,051
<i>Dr. Kearns</i>
<i>is our next witness.</i>

1542
01:32:40,259 --> 01:32:43,251
Because Dr. Kearns is
representing himself,

1543
01:32:43,329 --> 01:32:46,594
he is obligated to proceed
in a question and answer form.

1544
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,828
It may seem a little odd, but
you must carefully distinguish

1545
01:32:50,903 --> 01:32:54,168
between the question being
asked and the answer being given.

1546
01:32:54,507 --> 01:32:55,997
Dr. Kearns?

1547
01:32:56,075 --> 01:32:57,633
Thank you, Your Honor.

1548
01:32:57,777 --> 01:32:59,540
Dad, don't forget the jury.

1549
01:33:06,952 --> 01:33:10,217
Could you please state your
name and tell us where you live?

1550
01:33:13,592 --> 01:33:17,050
My name is Dr. Robert Kearns
and I live in Detroit, Michigan.

1551
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:19,530
Do you need my address?

1552
01:33:22,635 --> 01:33:25,866
No, that won't be necessary,
but we would like a...

1553
01:33:25,938 --> 01:33:28,873
Dr. Kearns.
Why don't you just have a seat?

1554
01:33:28,941 --> 01:33:31,341
Relax and do your
examination from there.

1555
01:33:37,483 --> 01:33:38,575
Thank you.

1556
01:33:41,387 --> 01:33:44,982
<i>Dr. Kearns, was the Intermittent
Wiper your first invention?</i>

1557
01:33:46,125 --> 01:33:48,616
No, it was not, but it
was probably my best.

1558
01:33:48,694 --> 01:33:51,686
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel's leading the witness.

1559
01:33:52,198 --> 01:33:56,191
What? Overruled. Proceed.

1560
01:33:56,635 --> 01:34:01,072
<i>Thank you. Uh, could you describe
for the court your first invention?</i>

1561
01:34:02,575 --> 01:34:04,805
My first invention
was in college.

1562
01:34:04,877 --> 01:34:08,438
Back then, uh, yellow margarine,
because of the dairy lobby,

1563
01:34:08,514 --> 01:34:12,382
couldn't be sold in stores, because
it would look like, like butter.

1564
01:34:14,353 --> 01:34:19,723
So I came up with a bag, basically a
plastic bag, with a little seal on the top,

1565
01:34:19,792 --> 01:34:22,761
and you would insert
a tab of yellow dye

1566
01:34:22,828 --> 01:34:25,296
in order to make the margarine
appear to look like butter.

1567
01:34:25,364 --> 01:34:26,422
Dr. Kearns.

1568
01:34:26,499 --> 01:34:27,932
But it wasn't.
It was margarine.

1569
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,264
Could we move on to the reason
why we're all here? The wiper?

1570
01:34:30,336 --> 01:34:35,797
<i>Yes. Yes. Yes. Could you, Dr.
Kearns, please explain your concept</i>

1571
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:37,900
<i>for the Intermittent Wiper?</i>

1572
01:34:38,344 --> 01:34:42,212
In 1941, the Supreme Court
came up with the notion that,

1573
01:34:42,281 --> 01:34:47,116
somewhere in the process of inventing,
the inventor must experience some sort moment.

1574
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:52,919
What they called "a flash of genius,"
in order to qualify for a patent.

1575
01:34:53,926 --> 01:34:57,987
And I probably owe
my flash to my honeymoon.

1576
01:34:59,732 --> 01:35:03,634
I was very much in love, and my
wife Phyllis and I were at a hotel.

1577
01:35:03,769 --> 01:35:07,535
And I was opening a bottle of
champagne and not paying attention.

1578
01:35:09,074 --> 01:35:11,440
I was probably thinking
how lucky I was.

1579
01:35:11,944 --> 01:35:15,471
And popped the cork and it
went off, hit me in the eye.

1580
01:35:15,548 --> 01:35:17,573
This one right here.
About knocked me out.

1581
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:21,984
I was bleeding everywhere and
they operated on me that night.

1582
01:35:22,187 --> 01:35:26,851
And they saved my eye. And the first
thing I saw the next morning was Phyllis.

1583
01:35:28,494 --> 01:35:31,986
Yeah. I'm legally
blind in my left eye,

1584
01:35:32,064 --> 01:35:35,522
and I've thought about the human
eye because of that ever since.

1585
01:35:38,337 --> 01:35:42,603
And years ago, I was riding back
from church with my family and

1586
01:35:42,675 --> 01:35:45,075
it was drizzling outside,
and I had a thought.

1587
01:35:45,144 --> 01:35:49,740
Why couldn't a wiper
work like an eyelid?

1588
01:35:52,818 --> 01:35:55,218
Why couldn't it blink?

1589
01:35:58,223 --> 01:36:00,123
That's how I came up with it.

1590
01:36:04,697 --> 01:36:07,325
Hello, jury.

1591
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,826
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

1592
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:14,168
What am I doing here?
What are we all doing here?

1593
01:36:16,008 --> 01:36:19,034
I'm here because my mother
and father and their

1594
01:36:20,646 --> 01:36:21,772
mother and father and
Uncle Wiggly and...

1595
01:36:27,186 --> 01:36:30,246
Good evening, Dennis.
My name is Charlie Defao.

1596
01:36:30,556 --> 01:36:32,456
I know who you are.

1597
01:36:32,524 --> 01:36:35,015
Right. May I come in?

1598
01:36:36,228 --> 01:36:37,593
Let him in, son.

1599
01:36:43,936 --> 01:36:46,268
Hello, Bob.
- Mr. Defao.

1600
01:36:47,806 --> 01:36:49,034
Good evening.

1601
01:36:54,279 --> 01:36:57,544
Bob, what do you say,

1602
01:36:57,616 --> 01:37:02,076
we take the guesswork and the anxiety out
of the situation, for everybody's sake?

1603
01:37:02,988 --> 01:37:04,285
Can we do that?

1604
01:37:04,356 --> 01:37:05,482
What's going on?

1605
01:37:05,557 --> 01:37:06,956
No, just...

1606
01:37:07,493 --> 01:37:11,589
Bob, $30 million.

1607
01:37:11,664 --> 01:37:13,632
Thirty million?
- Yep.

1608
01:37:13,699 --> 01:37:17,658
I'm here tonight to offer your father,
essentially this family, that much money.

1609
01:37:17,736 --> 01:37:19,931
The trial goes away.
We don't leave this to a jury.

1610
01:37:20,005 --> 01:37:22,496
We settle this here tonight.

1611
01:37:22,641 --> 01:37:25,769
But no statement
of my invention?

1612
01:37:25,844 --> 01:37:28,074
Or, or the time or energy,
my ruined reputation...

1613
01:37:28,147 --> 01:37:29,876
And more money than you
can have ever imagined.

1614
01:37:29,948 --> 01:37:33,281
Bob, I am telling you, if you
trust this to a Detroit jury,

1615
01:37:33,352 --> 01:37:35,513
you could walk
away with nothing.

1616
01:37:35,688 --> 01:37:38,248
Okay? Now, look
at these guys.

1617
01:37:38,323 --> 01:37:41,759
Can you imagine what that
would mean for their future?

1618
01:37:50,102 --> 01:37:53,128
What do you kids think?
I've put you through all this.

1619
01:37:55,407 --> 01:37:58,968
You've certainly earned the right
to say anything you want to say.

1620
01:38:03,716 --> 01:38:04,705
Timmy?

1621
01:38:05,751 --> 01:38:08,276
I don't know, Dad.
It's a shitload of money.

1622
01:38:10,856 --> 01:38:12,483
Don't do it, Dad.

1623
01:38:14,193 --> 01:38:16,491
Hell with it, Dad.
We've come this far.

1624
01:38:17,796 --> 01:38:20,230
Well, Mr. Defao, you don't
have much luck in this house.

1625
01:38:20,299 --> 01:38:21,789
Bob, let me ask...

1626
01:38:21,867 --> 01:38:25,564
No. I'll see you tomorrow.

1627
01:38:27,239 --> 01:38:32,575
This is insane. I mean 20 years of
litigating, this family takes the cake.

1628
01:38:39,485 --> 01:38:41,885
Well, gentlemen, I'm looking
forward to your final arguments.

1629
01:38:41,954 --> 01:38:43,512
Dr. Kearns, Mr. Finley.

1630
01:38:43,589 --> 01:38:46,820
The defense would like to recall
a witness to the stand, Your Honor.

1631
01:38:46,892 --> 01:38:48,655
Mr. Robert Kearns.

1632
01:38:48,794 --> 01:38:51,194
No! Is that procedure?

1633
01:38:51,263 --> 01:38:52,491
Is this really necessary?

1634
01:38:52,564 --> 01:38:54,498
I have to say that I certainly
think it is, Your Honor.

1635
01:38:54,566 --> 01:38:57,399
We'll be brief,
but it is quite pertinent.

1636
01:38:57,469 --> 01:38:59,460
Your Honor, I'm ready for
my summary right now.

1637
01:38:59,538 --> 01:39:01,597
Well, it'll have
to wait, Dr. Kearns.

1638
01:39:01,673 --> 01:39:03,265
Please take the stand.

1639
01:39:10,783 --> 01:39:14,014
Please keep in mind you're
still under oath, Dr. Kearns.

1640
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:21,519
Mr. Kearns, you have
testified here that Mr. Tyler

1641
01:39:21,627 --> 01:39:25,791
told you that you had, quote,
"won the wiper competition."

1642
01:39:26,932 --> 01:39:27,990
Yes.

1643
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:31,526
And you firmly believe that
that's the truth, don't you?

1644
01:39:31,603 --> 01:39:33,264
Yes, I do.

1645
01:39:33,338 --> 01:39:37,206
It couldn't have been
something that misheard?

1646
01:39:38,143 --> 01:39:39,235
Something that
you imagined?

1647
01:39:39,311 --> 01:39:40,300
No.

1648
01:39:41,213 --> 01:39:46,116
Do you recall being removed from a bus
in Maryland by police four years ago?

1649
01:39:48,887 --> 01:39:49,876
Yes.

1650
01:39:49,955 --> 01:39:53,083
And do you remember what you
told the officers at the time?

1651
01:39:53,158 --> 01:39:55,786
That you were on your way to
Washington, D.C. and

1652
01:39:55,861 --> 01:39:57,726
that it was at the request
of the White House?

1653
01:39:57,796 --> 01:39:59,787
Do you remember
that, Mr. Kearns?

1654
01:40:01,633 --> 01:40:02,827
Yes. And at that time...

1655
01:40:02,901 --> 01:40:04,300
Just answer the
questions please.

1656
01:40:04,369 --> 01:40:06,894
Was it at the request
of the Vice President?

1657
01:40:09,474 --> 01:40:10,566
No, it was not.

1658
01:40:10,642 --> 01:40:13,611
And were you subsequently treated
for a nervous breakdown and

1659
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,977
confined to the Rockville
State Mental Facility?

1660
01:40:16,048 --> 01:40:17,106
Yes.

1661
01:40:17,182 --> 01:40:20,208
And that was because you
were mentally unstable, right?

1662
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:22,880
I was seeking medical
treatment at the time.

1663
01:40:22,955 --> 01:40:25,219
But you were convinced
that the White House

1664
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:28,259
wanted you to come to
Washington, D.C., weren't you?

1665
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,618
Yes.

1666
01:40:29,761 --> 01:40:34,926
Just as you were convinced that Mr. Tyler
told you that you won the wiper competition.

1667
01:40:36,335 --> 01:40:39,031
Thank you, Mr. Kearns.
No further questions.

1668
01:40:45,344 --> 01:40:48,973
I'm gonna get a soda or something.
You guys want anything? Dad?

1669
01:40:55,921 --> 01:40:57,650
Fuck Charlie Defao.

1670
01:41:04,096 --> 01:41:07,657
I took some time off yesterday
and went to my mother's for dinner.

1671
01:41:08,734 --> 01:41:11,134
On the way over there,
I thought back to

1672
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:14,671
how when I was a kid my mother
used to make lemon meringue pie.

1673
01:41:14,773 --> 01:41:17,139
But not just any old
lemon meringue pie.

1674
01:41:17,576 --> 01:41:20,841
The best lemon meringue
pie in the world.

1675
01:41:20,979 --> 01:41:22,913
See, she had one of
those hand squeezers,

1676
01:41:22,981 --> 01:41:26,974
and she would crank out that
lemon juice, all for that pie.

1677
01:41:29,187 --> 01:41:32,156
After I finished school and I started
making my own way in the world,

1678
01:41:32,224 --> 01:41:36,786
one of the first things I did is I went out
and I bought my mother an electric juicer.

1679
01:41:37,229 --> 01:41:39,129
And you know what?

1680
01:41:39,498 --> 01:41:41,864
She still makes the best lemon
meringue pie in the world.

1681
01:41:41,934 --> 01:41:46,928
And it would never occur to me,
to claim credit for that pie.

1682
01:41:49,207 --> 01:41:51,641
And that's what this
case is all about.

1683
01:41:53,312 --> 01:41:55,678
Who really baked
that lemon pie?

1684
01:41:56,648 --> 01:42:00,209
And there is no question,
what the evidence shows.

1685
01:42:00,285 --> 01:42:03,743
Who engineered,
designed and tested

1686
01:42:03,855 --> 01:42:08,724
windshield wipers with the
self-parking features back in the 1940s?

1687
01:42:08,794 --> 01:42:10,955
Ford Motor Company.

1688
01:42:11,029 --> 01:42:15,432
Who engineered, tested, produced
and sold windshield wipers

1689
01:42:15,534 --> 01:42:19,163
with what was called "depressed
park" back in the 1940s?

1690
01:42:19,371 --> 01:42:21,703
Ford Motor Company.

1691
01:42:21,773 --> 01:42:27,234
Now, I am truly proud of a system where
a layman, a dedicated college professor,

1692
01:42:27,312 --> 01:42:32,147
who has taught for many years, can
come in here and state his case.

1693
01:42:33,452 --> 01:42:36,444
Unfortunately, as we
have proven earlier,

1694
01:42:36,521 --> 01:42:40,321
he sometimes confuses
reality with fiction.

1695
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:45,425
Fortunately, he has sought
professional help in those cases.

1696
01:42:47,699 --> 01:42:51,795
But the sad fact of the matter
is that Robert Kearns,

1697
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:56,068
a good and decent man, has
dragged us all into this courtroom

1698
01:42:56,208 --> 01:42:59,837
over patents that have
been proven invalid.

1699
01:43:00,612 --> 01:43:05,709
Invalid. And that's what
this case is all about.

1700
01:43:07,352 --> 01:43:11,152
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your time and attention.

1701
01:43:12,424 --> 01:43:17,157
Oh, and you want to know who really
baked that lemon meringue pie?

1702
01:43:19,631 --> 01:43:24,000
Ford Motor Company.
Thank you.

1703
01:43:25,904 --> 01:43:27,735
Dr. Kearns.

1704
01:43:32,144 --> 01:43:34,874
Okay, Dad, let's go.

1705
01:43:40,052 --> 01:43:43,112
One of Mr. Finley's
facts is undeniable,

1706
01:43:44,056 --> 01:43:46,854
I never baked a lemon meringue
pie in my entire life.

1707
01:43:55,634 --> 01:43:57,295
<i>Why are we here?</i>

1708
01:43:58,837 --> 01:44:01,032
<i>I am asking why</i>
<i>you and I are here.</i>

1709
01:44:05,077 --> 01:44:06,874
<i>Why have our lives crossed?</i>

1710
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:13,650
<i>Well, one thing</i>
<i>I can tell you.</i>

1711
01:44:13,718 --> 01:44:16,118
We are not here
because of anything

1712
01:44:16,221 --> 01:44:19,748
Ford did or didn't do
back in the 1940s.

1713
01:44:22,527 --> 01:44:25,587
Mr. Finley over here has made it
an art out of talking about all

1714
01:44:25,664 --> 01:44:27,495
the things that
I didn't invent.

1715
01:44:29,134 --> 01:44:32,399
But what Mr. Finley
has a very hard time

1716
01:44:32,471 --> 01:44:35,269
talking about are
the things I did invent.

1717
01:44:36,708 --> 01:44:40,269
<i>And why is that?</i>
<i>Because he can't, that is why.</i>

1718
01:44:44,015 --> 01:44:48,975
But we are here because
the Ford Motor Company,

1719
01:44:50,222 --> 01:44:56,991
used their influence, and their
money, and all their corporate power

1720
01:44:57,062 --> 01:44:59,087
to take advantage
of the situation.

1721
01:44:59,831 --> 01:45:03,562
Ladies and gentlemen, what
they did was downright wrong.

1722
01:45:04,703 --> 01:45:07,433
They claimed another
man's work for their own.

1723
01:45:08,874 --> 01:45:14,608
And now, all these years
later, after getting caught,

1724
01:45:16,948 --> 01:45:20,111
they have the arrogance to sit
here and look you in the eye

1725
01:45:20,185 --> 01:45:24,087
and say, "No, no, no, the Ford,
Ford Company didn't do anything wrong."

1726
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:27,788
No, they knew it all along.

1727
01:45:27,893 --> 01:45:31,385
They, had everything they
needed to build this invention.

1728
01:45:33,165 --> 01:45:38,660
They knew it already. But I can tell
you that they did not know everything.

1729
01:45:39,738 --> 01:45:43,037
They did not know everything
on that hot summer day

1730
01:45:43,108 --> 01:45:46,737
that I showed up in their parking
lot with my partner, Gil Previck,

1731
01:45:47,012 --> 01:45:50,675
and an early version of what I
called the Kearns Blinking Eye Motor.

1732
01:45:52,684 --> 01:45:55,380
And now, with all these great
impressive lawyers over here,

1733
01:45:55,453 --> 01:45:58,786
they're trying to tell you
that my patents were expired.

1734
01:45:58,857 --> 01:46:01,325
That the patent office
made a mistake,

1735
01:46:01,393 --> 01:46:05,796
not one time, not two times,
but five times

1736
01:46:05,864 --> 01:46:07,798
when they issued
me my patents.

1737
01:46:08,633 --> 01:46:10,658
And now they're trying
to make you believe

1738
01:46:10,735 --> 01:46:13,295
that they're worthless,
that they're nothing.

1739
01:46:13,638 --> 01:46:17,074
That my life's work
is nothing.

1740
01:46:17,142 --> 01:46:20,600
They want you to believe that,
because that is what they believe.

1741
01:46:28,253 --> 01:46:31,154
Well, I want you, uh...

1742
01:46:36,461 --> 01:46:39,294
I want you to know something.

1743
01:46:39,531 --> 01:46:41,192
When I walked into
this courtroom,

1744
01:46:41,266 --> 01:46:43,962
I was wearing a
badge right here.

1745
01:46:44,069 --> 01:46:48,005
You couldn't see it.
It said I was an inventor.

1746
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:50,469
A contributor to society.

1747
01:46:52,377 --> 01:46:55,175
And I know that you couldn't
see this when I walked in here.

1748
01:46:55,247 --> 01:46:58,182
And right now there are
people still in this courtroom

1749
01:46:58,250 --> 01:46:59,512
who can't see that badge.

1750
01:46:59,584 --> 01:47:03,884
Mr. Finley, well,
he can't see that badge.

1751
01:47:04,456 --> 01:47:06,651
None of the men
at that table can.

1752
01:47:07,592 --> 01:47:11,050
But I'd like to believe that
after everything that you've heard,

1753
01:47:12,597 --> 01:47:16,226
and everything that you've listened
to for these past few weeks,

1754
01:47:16,301 --> 01:47:18,826
that you can see it,
you can see this badge.

1755
01:47:22,974 --> 01:47:24,737
That's what I hope.

1756
01:47:32,217 --> 01:47:33,844
I can see you're tired.

1757
01:47:34,786 --> 01:47:37,311
And I'm tired, too.

1758
01:47:37,422 --> 01:47:39,617
So I'm not gonna sit up
here and try and interpret

1759
01:47:39,691 --> 01:47:42,489
everything you've heard
for these past few weeks.

1760
01:47:42,627 --> 01:47:44,925
I'm just gonna ask you
to use your memory

1761
01:47:44,996 --> 01:47:46,486
and your good sense

1762
01:47:49,701 --> 01:47:51,225
to do the right thing.

1763
01:47:51,303 --> 01:47:53,396
That's all I could
ask of anybody.

1764
01:47:57,976 --> 01:48:01,844
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you.

1765
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:08,777
Thank you, Dr. Kearns.
Thank you, Mr. Finley.

1766
01:48:40,385 --> 01:48:42,478
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

1767
01:48:42,721 --> 01:48:44,211
We have, Your Honor.

1768
01:48:44,923 --> 01:48:46,823
Would you please read it?

1769
01:48:47,292 --> 01:48:50,159
In the <i>Robert Kearns vs.</i>
<i>the Ford Motor Company,</i>

1770
01:48:50,228 --> 01:48:53,595
we find that the Ford Motor
Company did infringe on...

1771
01:49:00,538 --> 01:49:03,701
...did infringe on patents
held by Robert Kearns.

1772
01:49:03,775 --> 01:49:07,267
In consideration of these
non-willful infringements,

1773
01:49:07,379 --> 01:49:11,543
we award the plaintiff
$10,100,000.

1774
01:49:23,962 --> 01:49:27,363
I can't believe we won.
- We really did it.

1775
01:49:27,432 --> 01:49:30,026
That's amazing!
- We won, Daddy.

1776
01:49:30,268 --> 01:49:32,702
Bob. Congratulations.

1777
01:49:32,771 --> 01:49:35,103
Hell, you earned it.
I'm really happy for you.

1778
01:49:35,173 --> 01:49:36,868
Thank you, Gil.

1779
01:49:52,123 --> 01:49:55,354
Phyllis? Phyllis!

1780
01:50:03,401 --> 01:50:05,164
Congratulations, Robert.

1781
01:50:06,971 --> 01:50:10,839
You finally got everything you wanted.
And you deserve it.

1782
01:50:12,277 --> 01:50:15,440
Well, not everything.

1783
01:50:15,513 --> 01:50:17,310
I don't get the last
12 years back.

1784
01:50:18,583 --> 01:50:20,710
I suppose not.

1785
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:23,287
But it's over.

1786
01:50:23,555 --> 01:50:27,184
I don't
think so. No.

1787
01:50:27,959 --> 01:50:31,019
It'll never be over.
There'll always be another battle.

1788
01:50:31,095 --> 01:50:32,790
That's just you.

1789
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:35,627
Yeah,

1790
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:37,327
I've been thinking
about that.

1791
01:50:38,403 --> 01:50:40,303
I don't know if I can
go through this again.

1792
01:50:40,371 --> 01:50:42,566
Dr. Kearns?
Dr. Kearns!

1793
01:50:43,675 --> 01:50:44,937
Oh.
- Wow!

1794
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:47,209
Louis...
- Wow!

1795
01:50:47,312 --> 01:50:48,472
We just wanted to
congratulate you.

1796
01:50:48,546 --> 01:50:49,638
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1797
01:50:49,714 --> 01:50:52,205
A bunch of us, we got
together and we got you this.

1798
01:50:52,283 --> 01:50:53,545
Oh...

1799
01:50:55,553 --> 01:50:57,111
You were just excellent in
there. I mean, I don't think

1800
01:50:57,188 --> 01:50:59,179
they know what hit them back there.
We were just talking about it.

1801
01:50:59,257 --> 01:51:01,191
Like, we were talking about
it as the whole thing happened.

1802
01:51:01,259 --> 01:51:04,126
That was something else.
Thank you. Thank you.

1803
01:51:04,195 --> 01:51:05,992
It's just great.
Wow!

1804
01:51:13,738 --> 01:51:15,797
There was like,
19 reporters there.

1805
01:51:15,874 --> 01:51:17,341
Yeah, I saw
a guy from CNN.

1806
01:51:17,408 --> 01:51:18,875
There were some other
television studios, too.

1807
01:51:18,943 --> 01:51:20,911
Well, that's what I meant.

1808
01:51:20,979 --> 01:51:22,105
I had chocolate.

1809
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:23,442
Oh, thanks.
- I had strawberry.

1810
01:51:23,515 --> 01:51:25,244
I know, you guys, I know.
- We know.

1811
01:51:25,316 --> 01:51:27,113
Might I be able to get
a hamburger, too?

1812
01:51:27,352 --> 01:51:28,819
I think we can work
on that for you, sure.

1813
01:51:28,887 --> 01:51:30,115
Thanks.

1814
01:51:30,188 --> 01:51:33,351
So, uh, anyone see Kathy kiss up to
that guy from the <i>Washington Post?</i>

1815
01:51:33,424 --> 01:51:34,448
Oh, yeah.

1816
01:51:34,526 --> 01:51:37,290
He wasn't from there.
He was from Channel 7, actually.

1817
01:51:37,362 --> 01:51:37,985
Exactly.

1818
01:51:37,986 --> 01:51:39,853
Did you get your face
up in there, big enough?

1819
