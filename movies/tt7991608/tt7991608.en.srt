<i>Though many know</i>
<i>the tragic love story</i>

3
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,541
<i>of Antony and Cleopatra,</i>

4
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,625
<i>the wayward Roman general</i>

5
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,833
{\an8}<i>who fell madly in love
with the enchanting Egyptian queen,</i>

6
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,916
{\an8}<i>both of them taking their lives</i>

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,083
<i>rather than face a world
without each other,</i>

8
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,041
<i>few know the secret story</i>

9
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:09,500
<i>of the most sought-after prize
and unsolved puzzle of their time.</i>

10
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,625
<i>The mystery of Cleopatra's third egg.</i>

11
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:17,541
<i>On their wedding day,
as a symbol of his undying devotion,</i>

12
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,625
<i>Mark Antony presented Cleopatra
with three bejeweled eggs,</i>

13
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,166
<i>each one more exquisite than the last.</i>

14
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:29,750
<i>For centuries, these eggs were thought
to be nothing more than myth, rumor.</i>

15
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,041
<i>But then, in 1907,</i>

16
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,625
{\an8}<i>just outside of Cairo,
a local farmer unearthed two of them.</i>

17
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,833
<i>Some say the third egg was never found.</i>

18
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,708
<i>Others claim it was discovered,</i>

19
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,791
<i>but just as quickly lost,
never to be seen again.</i>

20
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:49,166
<i>Join us as we explore that very question.</i>

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,791
<i>What happened to Cleopatra's lost egg?</i>

22
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,833
<i>Who may hold it in their possession?</i>

23
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,916
<i>And most importantly,
will we ever see the day in which</i>

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,208
<i>all three eggs are reunited
for the first time in over 2,000 years?</i>

25
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:06,375
<i>Cleopatra's first egg
is on display for all to see</i>

26
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:10,333
{\an8}<i>at the world-famous Museo Nazionale
di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome.</i>

27
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,875
<i>The second egg has been
sold at auction numerous times</i>

28
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,375
<i>and currently is held
in a private collection.</i>

29
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,375
You're not a cop.

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,041
You're right, I'm not.

31
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,500
You know what I mean, Agent.
Your badge is no good here.

32
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,208
So no American cowboy stuff.

33
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,083
Don't worry. Left my chaps at home.

34
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,625
You sure about this?

35
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,541
I know how he thinks.
He's gonna do it today. Trust me.

36
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,041
All right, then, here we go.

37
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,666
- Impossible.
- I'm not asking.

38
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,166
You need to shut the museum down,
evacuate your visitors,

39
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,458
and seal all ingress
and egress points immediately.

40
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,000
And Interpol has the authority
to compel me to do so?

41
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,500
Don't test me, Director.

42
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,625
You should listen to her.

43
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,208
And who are you? Her bodyguard?

44
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,791
This is Special Agent John Hartley
of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.

45
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,791
He's a consulting profiler
who specializes in art crime.

46
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,166
You don't look like a profiler.

47
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,958
Yeah, I get that a lot.

48
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,541
Forty-one hours ago, Agent Hartley
received credible intelligence that

49
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,000
the most wanted art thief in the world,
a man named Nolan Booth,

50
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,583
intends to steal
the Egg of Cleopatra today.

51
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,750
Who provided you this information?

52
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,833
The Bishop.

53
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,458
You cannot be serious.

54
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,125
My dear, The Bishop is nothing more
than a boogeyman story in the art world.

55
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,250
It's a catch-all concept.
It's someone to blame

56
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,041
when you and your friends
in law enforcement

57
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,541
are too incompetent to solve the case.

58
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,208
Listen to me, unless we stop it,
that egg is gonna be stolen today.

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,000
In fact, it may already be gone.

60
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,416
Already gone, you say?

61
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,833
Now, if you'll excuse me, Inspector,
I believe I owe your supervisor a call.

62
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you have thermal sensors in this room?

63
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,041
- Of course we do.
- Show it to me.

64
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,833
You're wasting our time.

65
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,708
What, may I ask, are you looking for?

66
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,333
Well, you see, Cleopatra's first egg
is covered in 18-karat gold.

67
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,916
And gold reflects radiation.

68
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,958
That egg should be
reflecting the heat in this room.

69
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,833
It should be red, not blue.

70
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,541
It's probably just an error
in the thermal sensor.

71
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,500
Well, there's only one way to find out.

72
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,583
Hey, sorry, big man, but there's
no food or drink in the museum.

73
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,541
Thank you.

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,083
No, no, wait a moment.
What do you think you're doing?

75
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,083
Relax, it's fine.
He knows what he's doing.

76
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,666
Seal the room. Now!

77
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,083
Move! Move!

78
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,583
He's heading for the exit.

79
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,875
Oh.

80
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:05,958
Freeze!

81
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,041
He is here.
Send reinforcements.

82
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,416
He's on the scaffolding.

83
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,375
We're gonna need more...

84
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,458
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Ah.

85
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,208
Jesus,
you scared me.

86
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,833
I know you. You're the… You're the slow
bald guy that's been chasing me.

87
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,291
What do you got in the bag?

88
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,125
You're American. What brings you to Rome?

89
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,000
Gelato, the Colosseum.

90
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,791
- Oh, it's beautiful. Beautiful place.
- Yeah.

91
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,833
- First time?
- Yep.

92
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,583
That was a fun foot chase, right?
Lots of twists and turns. Hijinks.

93
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,875
Who knew it'd end up like this?

94
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,833
- I did.
- Right.

95
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,750
Fun's over, Nolan Booth.
Give me the bag, turn around,

96
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,833
put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.

97
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,875
Okay. Well, hold on one sec.
I just have two questions.

98
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,458
Okay. Um…

99
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,125
First question,
where'd you get that jacket?

100
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,458
It's a statement piece.

101
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,916
Somewhere there is a very nude cow
whispering…

102
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,958
… "Worth it."

103
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,541
And number two, on the whole
arresting me thing, I totally get it.

104
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,208
You know, baby did a bad, bad thing. Yeah.

105
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,250
But you don't happen to have,
like, a badge or somethin'

106
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,791
tucked away in the turtleneck, do you?

107
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,708
I don't need to show you my badge
because I've got a gun.

108
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,750
Here's the thing.
You're putting me in a pickle.

109
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,791
Without identification,
how do I know who you are?

110
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,666
For all I know, you could be the bad guy,

111
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,291
and I could be the other bad guy.

112
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,875
You're right. I am the bad guy.

113
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,750
Now shut up and give me the bag
before I shoot you in the mouth.

114
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,083
- I'm gonna give this to you.
- Good.

115
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,750
Yeah, I'm just gonna give it to you
'cause I don't even want it.

116
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,750
For the record, none of this feels good.

117
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,000
Booth, don't move!

118
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,416
Whoa!

119
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,041
Come on, let's go.

120
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,791
What the hell?

121
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,541
Where are you going?

122
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,625
Asshole!

123
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,500
Can you hold on to this for me?

124
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,250
Thanks.

125
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,375
What the hell?
You idiot! Are you blind?

126
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,791
Shit.

127
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,833
Nice place you got here.

128
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:58,208
Special Agent John Hartley, FBI.
We met earlier.

129
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,375
Aren't you a little outside
your jurisdiction?

130
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,083
I am.

131
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,791
Good thing these guys aren't.

132
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,583
Wow!

133
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,666
Hi, guys.
Don't take your shoes off or anything.

134
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,208
You sure you brought enough guns?

135
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,250
What can I say? I like to be thorough.

136
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,041
No way, José.

137
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,791
The intrepid Inspector Das.

138
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,375
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
I'll take that. Thank you.

139
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,833
- It's nice to meet a fan.
- Oh, that's cute.

140
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,583
You wanna know what else is cute?

141
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,750
Because you're wanted
in 18 separate countries,

142
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,083
I get to choose which one of them
detains you until trial,

143
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,583
given your escape history.

144
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,833
What are you, six for six now?

145
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah. One more
and I get a Shawshank jacket.

146
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:48,958
Keep making your jokes

147
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,416
because I'm about to send you
to the worst place in the world.

148
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,708
Your Instagram account?

149
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,875
You know,
I'm really starting to not like you.

150
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,166
Oh, come on!

151
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,583
Not like me? You don't even know me.

152
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,791
We could have a lot in common.

153
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,625
Maybe I don't know you,
but I've been building a profile on you,

154
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,625
ever since you stole William Strang's
<i>Lady with a Red Hat </i>from the Tate

155
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,958
back in 2014.

156
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,375
You can't prove that was me.

157
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,416
I got that on Etsy.

158
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,625
I've been tracking
your scores for a while.

159
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,041
So let me take a crack
at who I think you really are.

160
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:26,916
Sure thing. Yeah.

161
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,333
- Only child.
- Mmm-hmm.

162
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,375
Dad's a Swiss cop,
Mom's an American professor.

163
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,708
You started stealing
between the ages of six and eight.

164
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,791
You found out
you had a real talent for it.

165
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,750
It made you feel special, different.

166
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,583
You like to work alone.
You don't like a team.

167
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,708
The only jobs you take are the ones
that make the big, splashy headlines,

168
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,833
which tells me that you only do it
for the thrill and not the money.

169
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,458
Are you insane? I love the money.

170
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,750
I'm not done yet.
I'm just getting to the good part.

171
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,208
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

172
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,250
A lot of thieves out there
who claim to only do it for the money.

173
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,625
That's not unusual.

174
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,375
But what is unusual
is the risk that you take.

175
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,250
The chances.

176
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:15,916
It's as though you wanna get caught
so you can escape,

177
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,791
just to prove yourself all over again,

178
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,416
and prove that
you're better than everybody else

179
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,833
and that you're worthy.

180
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,583
Worthy of what? This speech?

181
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,041
Your father's love.

182
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,750
Congratulations.

183
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,458
How'd you find me?

184
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,708
Well, the same way I knew that
you were gonna steal the egg in Rome.

185
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,916
The Bishop.

186
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,166
The Bishop.

187
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,875
Get him ready to move.

188
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,041
Booth, I'm curious.

189
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,791
How does it feel to be sold out
by the most wanted art thief in the world?

190
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,500
I'm the most wanted art thief
in the world.

191
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,708
You were.

192
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,291
Wait. Wait here.

193
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,500
There's no chance I'm putting
that thing in the same van as him.

194
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,166
- See you at the airfield.
- I'll see you there.

195
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,833
Door open.

196
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,833
All right. We're good.

197
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,625
Thank you.

198
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,041
Hi, there.

199
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,458
- You leaving town?
- Flight's in an hour.

200
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,625
Something up?

201
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,416
You could say that. Hmm.

202
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay. What's going on?

203
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,375
Funny,
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

204
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,083
What are you doing with that?

205
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:32,125
Oh, this priceless piece
of ancient cultural whatnot?

206
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,583
Oops!

207
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,166
Booth gave us a fake egg.

208
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,500
I'll admit,
Booth was my first thought too.

209
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,750
Then I asked myself,
"How well do you really know someone

210
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,708
you only met 72 hours ago?"

211
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,458
And someone whose official credentials

212
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,083
came solely by
a written interagency communiqué.

213
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:57,875
So I called up the Assistant Director
of the BAU at Quantico, really nice lady.

214
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,083
She'd never heard of you.

215
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,708
- That's impossible.
- Is it?

216
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,875
Yes, it's impossible.

217
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,166
As impossible as a John Hartley
with a Swiss bank account

218
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,458
that received an $8 million wire transfer

219
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,500
from an encrypted third-party
on the same day the egg was stolen?

220
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,875
Quite a coincidence,
wouldn't you say, Agent?

221
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,958
<i>We have eyes on target.</i>

222
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,875
Listen, whatever you think this is,
whatever you think I did, I didn't do.

223
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,333
Someone's behind this.
The Bishop, maybe even Booth himself.

224
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,458
- I'm being set up.
- Maybe you are, maybe you're not.

225
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,958
Until I figure it out,
I'm gonna keep you where I can find you.

226
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,416
Now, normally,
I'm not a vindictive person, but,

227
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,250
well, I trusted you
and you hurt my feelings.

228
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,458
So I picked some place extra special.

229
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,500
It's a bit of a black site.
Kind of the land due process forgot.

230
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,750
You're under arrest, Agent Hartley.

231
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,083
Das, look at me. Look at my eyes.

232
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,791
I didn't do this.

233
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,708
I don't believe you.

234
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,291
You a top or a bottom?

235
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,500
Doesn't matter.
Prison's gonna decide for us.

236
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,833
You gotta be shittin' me.

237
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,583
Well, I'll say one thing
about ol' Inspector Das,

238
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:05,958
she's got a real sense of humor.

239
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,833
Put 'er there, roomie.

240
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,708
You're right, we should wash up first.

241
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,708
It's okay. You're safe here.

242
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:19,666
Except if they find out you're a cop.
Then they're gonna wanna kill you.

243
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,125
Bishop must have seen you
coming from a mile away.

244
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,125
Got your trust after selling me out.

245
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,541
Can't run a con without gaining
the mark's trust first, that's page one.

246
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,500
I know how a confidence scheme works,
trust me.

247
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,666
Well, you do now, that's for sure.

248
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,000
The same mystery thief who ratted me out
is the same one who framed you.

249
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,958
That seems like a coincidence,
don't you think?

250
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,083
This is not a coincidence. This is a plan.

251
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:54,166
In one move, The Bishop took out
her lead competitor and lead investigator.

252
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,541
- Two birds, one stone.
- Egg.

253
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:59,041
- What?
- Two birds, one egg.

254
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,625
It's kind of a lay-up.
Even Post Malone gets it.

255
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,791
This is farm-to-table, right? Thank you.

256
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,500
I don't understand why.

257
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,750
Why would The Bishop go to the trouble of
framing me when she already has the egg?

258
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,166
I mean, what's left?

259
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,166
Three hundred million dollars?

260
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,958
You're kidding.
I never heard of a price tag like that.

261
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:17,958
No one has.

262
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,000
But you don't understand,
that's not the price for just one egg.

263
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:22,750
Here's the deal.

264
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:26,375
Whoever brings
this Egyptian billionaire all three eggs

265
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:30,583
by the night of his daughter's wedding
gets all the marbles.

266
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,958
Turns out,
Mr. Big Daddy Big Bucks' daughter,

267
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,166
guess what her name is?

268
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,666
Stop guessing, it's Cleopatra.

269
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:41,458
I mean, these people are horrible.
But I like money, so…

270
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,208
So how does that work?

271
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,458
No one knows where the third egg is.
It's never been found.

272
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:49,833
I'm not gonna lie,
that's a bit of a problem.

273
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:51,958
I was gonna deal with
the second egg first.

274
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,333
Then the rest.

275
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:56,666
All right, well,
Bureau intel says that the second egg

276
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,458
is owned by an international arms dealer.

277
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,250
Sotto Voce. I know all about this guy.

278
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,666
His dad tried to strangle him
when he was 14.

279
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,041
Nobody can stand
this son of a bitch.

280
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,125
<i>Apparently, it left
quite the impression on him.</i>

281
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:11,500
<i>And strangling folks
became sort of a hobby for him.</i>

282
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,291
<i>He's a big fan.</i>

283
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:17,041
<i>Sotto Voce is super scary.</i>

284
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,666
<i>But he's not above having a good time.</i>

285
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,000
<i>Throws a masquerade party every year
for his top buyers</i>

286
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,208
<i>in his I-probably-have-a-tiny-penis villa
in Valencia.</i>

287
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,500
<i>Gunrunners are a little touchy
about their identity.</i>

288
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,958
<i>So the </i>Eyes Wide Shut <i>thing</i>
<i>takes the edge off for everyone.</i>

289
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:34,000
<i>Now, what none of these
evil one-percenters know</i>

290
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,583
<i>is that upstairs,
locked away in a secret vault,</i>

291
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:39,458
<i>Dr. Shirtless has in his possession</i>

292
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:42,375
<i>an ancient piece of pricelessness
that I like to call…</i>

293
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,541
<i>Cleopatra's second egg.</i>

294
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,875
And it's just begging for me to steal it.

295
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:52,708
I'd be on my way there right now
if you weren't such a super cop.

296
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,000
- Don't do that.
- What?

297
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,708
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

298
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:01,416
- I know what you're doing. Listen.
- I'm not doing anything.

299
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,750
These guys here,
if they find out you're a C-O-P…

300
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:08,250
This is a room full of convicted murderers
and toilet vodka enthusiasts.

301
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,416
We gotta make sure
they know you're not a cop.

302
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,791
- <i>Nyet politsiya.</i>
- Listen to me. I beg…

303
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,958
Guys? <i>Nyet politsiya. </i>Not a cop.

304
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:21,458
This man is not a cop, all right?

305
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:23,625
Get that through
your thick skulls right now!

306
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:26,375
He's a profiler for the FBI,

307
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:30,416
which does fall under the umbrella
of law enforcement, but not a cop.

308
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,916
It's similar, but it's not the same thing.
It's a complicated backstory.

309
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,666
This is our good friend,
Special Agent John Hartley.

310
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,208
Let's give him a warm welcome
to the prison, guys.

311
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:48,000
Thank you, guys.
I don't think anyone heard me. We're good.

312
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,833
All's quiet on the western front.

313
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,166
Nobody's… Oh, no.

314
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,375
Yep.
Drago Grande heard. Here he comes.

315
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,291
Okay, be cool.
Don't embarrass me.

316
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:03,958
Hello, sir.

317
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,500
<i>Politsiya.</i>

318
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,375
You die.

319
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:11,125
Okay, he knows.

320
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,125
He knows you're a cop.

321
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,791
The jig is up.

322
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,083
It's okay.

323
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,375
You can…

324
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,458
You can have mine.
You need some nourishment.

325
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:40,000
You should get up.
You look like a little bitch right now.

326
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,416
I say that as a friend.

327
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:46,958
Okay, look.

328
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,083
I don't wanna do
the whole prison fight thing with you…

329
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:54,375
- You got this. I'm in your corner.
- So please, no fight.

330
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,750
Let's just go back and finish our meals.

331
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:13,708
- No. No...
- Back to your cell!

332
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,958
God…

333
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,458
All that working out.

334
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,750
You still get your ass spanked
by a toothless man with tuberculosis...

335
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,958
Okay. Okay.

336
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:27,083
If you ever pull shit like that again,
it'll be the last thing you do.

337
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,250
Right.

338
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,625
- You don't know me, Booth.
- No.

339
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,291
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

340
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,416
Okay. Thank God, you're here.

341
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,750
The captain wants to see you.

342
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,666
Let's go!

343
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,875
Him?

344
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,583
Oh, no, us. Okay.

345
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:54,708
Hello, boys.

346
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:56,625
Oh, my God.

347
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:57,791
Wow.

348
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,250
You're the captain?

349
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:03,250
You might benefit
from a little career change.

350
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,208
I mean, I'm… I don't think runway,

351
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,250
but definitely
regional catalog work, fliers…

352
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,333
She's The Bishop.

353
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,958
No shit, dipdick!

354
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,208
It's so nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Booth.

355
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,916
Such a thrill to be face-to-face

356
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,416
with the second-best art thief
in the world.

357
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,875
Oh, I see what you did there.
That's…

358
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:28,083
Yeah, you got lucky
a couple of times early on, you know?

359
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,250
But you can't name one time
in the past year that you beat me.

360
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,041
- Helsinki.
- My parachute failed.

361
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,041
Jakarta.

362
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,166
- My Segway sank.
- Macau.

363
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,208
Nobody knew that Miley Cyrus
was going to be there.

364
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,916
It was a completely unannounced show.

365
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,875
You can have excuses or results.

366
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,625
Not both.

367
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:46,791
What are we doing here? What do you want?

368
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,750
To have a chat.

369
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,166
First of all, Agent Hartley,

370
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:54,041
please accept my sincerest apologies
for the whole mix-up in Rome.

371
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,666
<i>You see, after I stole the egg in Bali,</i>

372
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,958
<i>I then made an $8 million deposit
into an account registered in your name.</i>

373
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:06,916
<i>Then, all I had to do was sit back
and wait for Das to take the bait.</i>

374
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,541
<i>A few clever keystrokes
and a well-timed call intercept.</i>

375
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,791
<i>FBI BAU Director's office.</i>

376
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,958
And poof.

377
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,333
Bye-bye, Agent John Hartley.

378
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,583
Hello, suspicious suspect.

379
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,333
Funny, don't you think?

380
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,083
Shut up. You deleted my life.

381
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,208
And now I'm stuck in a cell
with this idiot.

382
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:34,041
Well, down to business then.

383
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,750
At the risk of stating the obvious,

384
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,375
I have the first egg in my possession,

385
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:43,666
and in less than 48 hours,
I'm gonna have the second one as well.

386
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:49,416
But that leaves an issue. The final egg.

387
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,000
Well, too bad for you.
Nobody knows where the third egg is.

388
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,166
He didn't tell you?

389
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,125
You didn't tell him?

390
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:59,000
- Didn't tell me what?
- I don't know what she's talking about.

391
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,458
Your cellmate here
knows exactly where the third egg is.

392
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,833
She's lying. I do not know
where the third egg is. I swear to God.

393
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,208
<i>I know where the third egg is.</i>
<i>I swear to God.</i>

394
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,291
Yes, that is me. Scratch that.
That was me. I did say that.

395
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,625
When were you gonna tell me
about the third egg?

396
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:18,000
I was never gonna tell you
about the third egg because you're a cop.

397
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,458
My offer to you, Mr. Booth, is this.

398
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:24,750
Tell me where the third egg is,
I'll get you out of here and give you 10%.

399
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,041
Rock-hard pass.

400
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,125
I'm sorry we couldn't do business.

401
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:31,166
Well, perhaps a few more days in here

402
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,125
with the prospect
of thousands more to come

403
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,875
will help change your mind.

404
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,916
I'll stop by once I have the second egg.

405
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:44,625
Oh, and when I do,
the offer's gonna be 5%.

406
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:48,291
Thank you, Captain.
Labor detail for them both.

407
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,625
Bye. Don't miss me too much.

408
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:53,916
Ta-ta!

409
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,083
Oh, hey, guys. Okay!

410
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,958
If we work together to catch her,

411
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,333
I can do things
to The Bishop you can't do.

412
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,000
There's no need to be disgusting.

413
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,916
Here we go. Three, two, one.
Lift with your neck.

414
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,250
I mean put her in prison. For life.

415
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:18,625
When that happens, guess who becomes
number one art thief in the world again?

416
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,708
Teamwork? It feels weird in my mouth.

417
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:24,875
Are you carrying your side?

418
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,833
I'm offended you'd even ask me that.

419
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:30,750
- Do something. It's slipping.
- Oh, relax, baldylocks.

420
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,041
See? Teamwork.

421
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,208
Team. Team. Team.
It feels weird in my mouth.

422
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,125
It does.

423
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:49,083
Say what you will about Russian prisons,
the soap is incredible.

424
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,875
- Are we doing this together or not?
- No added chemicals or perfumes.

425
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:54,500
It's just pure
good ol' fashioned glycerin.

426
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:58,083
- Ooh. Smell it.
- I'm not gonna smell it.

427
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,791
Sotto Voce's masquerade ball
is tomorrow night,

428
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,250
which means, if we're gonna beat
The Bishop to the second egg,

429
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,291
we have to be on the other side
of these walls by tomorrow morning.

430
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,875
I already know how I'm gonna steal it.

431
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:10,791
It'll take adjustment now The Bishop'll
be there, but I'll beat her to the punch.

432
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,083
"I"? What about "we"?

433
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:16,041
Why are you wearing the hairnet?
You're bald.

434
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,625
Okay, fine. You can be my plus-one
to Sotto Voce's party.

435
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:27,583
{\an8}Thanks. Clock's tickin'.
We gotta get outta here. What's the plan?

436
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,250
I'm working on it.

437
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,166
You're working on it?
You sound like you're working on it.

438
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,583
They say the most important part
of any plan is a good night's sleep.

439
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,666
Isn't the actual plan part
the most important part of the plan?

440
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,541
A lotta people make that mistake.

441
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,583
Back in Bali, that thing you said,

442
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,916
about me and my father, how'd you know?

443
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,625
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not a complex case.

444
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,208
The one thing
that doesn't quite line up for me is

445
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,958
how the son of a Swiss police captain
turns to a life of high crime.

446
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,083
Short version?

447
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:11,833
My father was a prolific asshole.

448
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:13,875
Long version?

449
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,125
When I was eight years old,

450
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,083
my dad thought I stole his watch.

451
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,125
He loved that piece of metal
more than anything.

452
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:29,000
He asked me if I stole it.
I told him I didn't.

453
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,625
He said he knew that I had
and that I was lying.

454
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,708
He didn't speak to me again after that.

455
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:38,541
Not on Christmas. Not on my birthday.

456
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,291
He went almost a full year,
just utter silence.

457
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,916
Like I didn't even exist.

458
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,000
Then one night, he…

459
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,750
He comes home
and he sits down at the dinner table…

460
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,958
And there it is.

461
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,250
There's the watch, the missing watch,

462
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,541
right there on his wrist.

463
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,416
Found out later that he put it
in his desk at work

464
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,208
and it got buried behind some papers
or something like that.

465
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:12,500
But he never apologized. He just, uh…

466
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,333
He just looked me in the eye
and said, "How was your day at school?"

467
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,833
Then he kept askin',
"How was your day at school?"

468
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,458
And I never answered him.

469
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:27,458
I just stared at him.
I didn't eat. I didn't drink.

470
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,083
Next week,
I found myself in boarding school.

471
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:36,916
Really?

472
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,083
I'm kidding.

473
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,375
Hey.

474
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,083
I'm sorry about all that.

475
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,958
Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's all right.

476
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,750
You learn a valuable lesson, you know?

477
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,166
It doesn't matter what you do,

478
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,125
only matters what they think you've done.

479
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,041
How about your old man?

480
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,875
I don't talk about him.

481
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,125
That bad, huh?

482
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,416
Good news.

483
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,541
I slept like a baby after
our little therapy session last night.

484
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:27,875
Better news,

485
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:31,375
I've got our escape plan
down to a simple three-step process.

486
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:33,750
All right, I'll bite.
What's the first step?

487
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:36,208
- Create a distraction.
- With soap?

488
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,416
You know what happens
when you mix soap, which is pure glycerin,

489
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,291
with a cleaning solution
that's essentially nitric acid?

490
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,416
- You get nitroglycerin.
- You get nitroglycerin.

491
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,375
We should run.

492
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,375
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

493
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,291
It's locked. We need a key card.

494
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,541
Step two, plan ahead.

495
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,791
- Where'd you get that?
<i>- Nyet politsiya.</i>

496
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,208
He's not a cop!

497
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,916
What's the plan... Son of a bitch!

498
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:59,041
What? Understood.

499
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,583
What are you doing?
What's step three?

500
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,166
Step three…

501
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,208
Rock Jenga.

502
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:30,833
You first.

503
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:33,958
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

504
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,250
Get back!

505
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,458
This way.

506
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:55,625
They're outside the walls.
Secure the perimeter.

507
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,291
Thank you.

508
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,375
Okay. Okay.

509
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,625
Can you fly a helicopter?

510
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,083
Does the back of your head
look like a huge penis?

511
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,791
The answer is yes!

512
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:58,166
Oh, that's fun. This is my best friend.

513
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,083
- We're not friends.
- We're best friends.

514
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,750
- They're over here!
- Go!

515
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,875
I can't believe nobody saw that.

516
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,333
Here they are! Fire!

517
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,041
Okay.

518
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh.

519
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,125
That's in Russian.

520
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,625
Go, he just has a pistol!

521
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,375
The forklift!

522
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:36,541
Huh.

523
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,125
Uh-oh.

524
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,083
Son of a bitch.

525
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,250
Reload!

526
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,708
Shit.

527
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,250
Oh, you made it. Thank God!

528
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,791
I was praying for you.

529
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,958
Don't give me that shit.
You were gonna leave me?

530
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,375
You said, "Save yourself."

531
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,250
I said, "Go,"
but I didn't mean without me.

532
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,416
You said, "Go save yourself."

533
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,500
And I was gonna carry you with me
in my heart like an eternal flame,

534
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,791
you stupid complainer.

535
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,291
Why is that blinking?

536
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,791
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

537
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,250
Ooh! Incoming!

538
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:45,708
See? Easy-peasy.

539
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,583
I know it sounds
like a tough childhood,

540
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,916
but my father made me who I am today.

541
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:01,541
Maybe that's my problem.

542
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:07,250
I'm so focused on winning all the time,
on being the best at what I do,

543
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:11,458
that I can never
just fully relax and just be.

544
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:14,791
Is that normal?

545
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,958
How the fuck would I know?

546
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,083
What?

547
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,958
I'm not a therapist.
I'm an intelligence analyst.

548
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm sorry.

549
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,666
I'm just dealing
with a lot right now

550
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,833
and you seemed like
someone I could talk to.

551
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,041
And it's so rare in my line of work

552
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,333
to find someone
who's just there to listen.

553
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:39,791
Thank you.

554
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:44,333
Anyway, I'm sorry
to rope you into all of this,

555
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,166
but just using your terminal here

556
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,625
to ensure that the origin point
of my message is untraceable.

557
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:52,333
Best way to do it is
from within the system itself.

558
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:55,791
They should really work on
patching the security vulnerability.

559
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,916
It's embarrassing.

560
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,875
Did you know that 99%
of all tracking protocols

561
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:02,041
focus on third-party movements?

562
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:07,291
No one ever expects the call
to come from inside the house, as it were.

563
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,083
Hence, your computer, your office.

564
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,916
Oh. Here we go.

565
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:18,166
Just need to slow down my competition,
such as they are.

566
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,375
I'm afraid that's
all the time we have for today.

567
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:49,125
I'm gonna have to end our session here.
Have a lovely day.

568
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,166
Freeze!

569
00:45:58,708 --> 00:45:59,833
See?

570
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:03,291
This is why we can't have nice things.

571
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:07,125
'Cause the moment I trust someone,
they tap the foot alarm beneath their desk

572
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:09,250
and then I'm forced
to do things like this.

573
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:13,041
I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed.

574
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,500
I really thought you were different.

575
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:18,666
Well, fool me once…

576
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,625
I'm gonna leave now and when he wakes up,

577
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:25,333
you're going to tell him
that you triggered the alarm falsely

578
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:28,041
and in his haste,
he tripped coming through the door.

579
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,708
And if you decide not to do that,

580
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,708
I want you to remember
one critically important thing.

581
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:39,625
I know everyone you work with
and every member of your family.

582
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,208
And I also know your browser history.

583
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,333
Nolan.

584
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:05,666
Tambwe! Come on, bring it in.

585
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:07,416
Oh.

586
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,416
I can't thank you enough for this.

587
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,625
I'm just glad
I could finally repay my debt to you.

588
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:13,833
And now I'm in yours.

589
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,666
- Come, everything is ready.
- Alright.

590
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,250
- I have juice boxes.
- That's very good.

591
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:21,708
Hey. Tambwe got us a costume change,
so we can get out of these filthy duds.

592
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:22,875
Oh. I'm so sorry.

593
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:26,000
Tambwe, this is Agent John Hartley

594
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:29,291
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It's a funny story.

595
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:32,166
A lot of his colleagues have
put a lot of your colleagues in prison.

596
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,250
It's exciting.

597
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,125
No juice boxes for you.

598
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,750
Oh, I see.

599
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,458
Nice jacket, while I "Gotta dance."

600
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:06,083
All right, man.
Don't even start with me, okay?

601
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,875
At least you're comfortable.

602
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,958
Well, clearly you have
this whole thing figured out.

603
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:16,041
- You wanna walk me through it?
- I do. Here's the deal.

604
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,208
<i>During the party,</i>

605
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:20,208
<i>the guests and the staff
are required to stay on the main floor,</i>

606
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,791
<i>and upstairs, the door to the egg room,</i>

607
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,541
<i>well, that's locked and heavily guarded.</i>

608
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:27,083
But there's another way in.
Hidden entrance.

609
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:28,375
<i>Here's what I'm thinkin'.</i>

610
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:31,000
<i>We dress up in matching black pajamas</i>

611
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:34,000
<i>and sneak past the featured extras
and into the bedroom.</i>

612
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:39,625
<i>Then, we slip through the study
and get our hands on his precious.</i>

613
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,708
Is that the egg?

614
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:43,750
I'm sorry.

615
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:51,333
- You are amazing.
- I know.

616
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:53,625
Wow.

617
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,291
- Hey, dickhead.
- Hmm?

618
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,583
Your last brilliant plan
had some kinks in it.

619
00:48:58,666 --> 00:48:59,583
Mmm-hmm.

620
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,916
So, what kinda security surveillance
are we looking at?

621
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,291
Well, the guy's an arms dealer,

622
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:06,416
so, you know, every square inch
of this place is gonna be on lock.

623
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,416
<i>Two-man guard teams at every access point
are signal rotated to keep them frosty.</i>

624
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,458
<i>Once they're on the move,
you only have 45 seconds until they land.</i>

625
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:15,875
<i>It's a pretty tight window.</i>

626
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,750
<i>The eyes and ears are
in a secure room in the west hall.</i>

627
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:24,375
<i>Eighty-seven motion-sensitive 8K cameras
with an overlapping field of vision,</i>

628
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,583
<i>so there are no natural blind spots.</i>

629
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,958
<i>They're always watching, always listening.</i>

630
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:30,708
<i>Kinda like Alexa but with guns.</i>

631
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,791
<i>Now, here's where
things get a little tricky.</i>

632
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,708
<i>The vault door to the egg room
is a military-grade,</i>

633
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:39,458
<i>biometric portal made out of
a foot and a half of solid titanium.</i>

634
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:42,666
<i>So you can't drill it
and you can't make it go boom.</i>

635
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,583
<i>The only way through it
is with facial and voice recognition.</i>

636
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:48,541
<i>And there's only one face
and one voice that opens it.</i>

637
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,541
Sotto Voce.

638
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,958
How are we gonna get
his voice and his facial?

639
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,625
Well, first off,
a positive mental attitude helps.

640
00:49:56,125 --> 00:50:00,291
But so does some pretty kick-ass
deepfake technology.

641
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,750
Spooky, right?

642
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,958
If you have
more than 12 images on the Internet,

643
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:09,958
I can send your mom
a video of you mouth-sexing a goat.

644
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:13,416
I'm not saying I'm gonna do that,
I'm just saying I could if I wanted to.

645
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,666
If I had enough time and enough pictures.

646
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:20,000
But wait, there's more.

647
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:24,333
<i>There's also a 12-digit randomly-generated
passcode that's changed every six minutes,</i>

648
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,958
<i>and that code can only be found
in Sotto Voce's phone,</i>

649
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:29,958
<i>and Sotto Voce's phone can only be found
in Sotto Voce's pants.</i>

650
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:32,875
{\an8}So, yeah, easy-peasy.

651
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:35,625
Oh, no, no, no! There's one more thing.
Kinda important.

652
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:40,875
We're gonna need his thumbprint 'cause
he never upgraded his iPhone -4, so…

653
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,416
So if we don't get his thumbprint,
we can't get the egg.

654
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,083
Oh, my God.

655
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:48,875
You can learn. This is amazing.

656
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,166
You are not sparkly enough.

657
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,416
I'm gonna get you a matching vest
to go with those pants.

658
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,500
Check, check. Roger Dodger.
What's your 20, free bird?

659
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:43,166
You don't have to do that.
I'm standing right next to you.

660
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,250
I'm not used to using these stupid things,

661
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,291
and I'm not used
to working with a partner.

662
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,916
We're not partners.
This is a marriage of convenience.

663
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,166
I want a divorce
and I'm keeping the kids.

664
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,583
Let's just do this.

665
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:56,833
I'll get the thumbprint,
you get Sotto Voce's phone.

666
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:31,708
We've got a party crasher.

667
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:35,583
Yeah, it's no biggie. No biggie.
We knew she'd be here.

668
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,750
We're here for the egg, not her.

669
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:40,041
Speak for yourself. I'm going in.

670
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,208
What are you doing?
That's not part of the plan.

671
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:44,250
Plans change.

672
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,833
Beautiful.

673
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:53,916
The sculpture, I mean.

674
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:58,625
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

675
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,791
It's just impossible for me
to tell who you are with that mask on.

676
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:05,375
How about now?

677
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:07,250
Agent Hartley!

678
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,875
So it was you all along.

679
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,708
Such a clever disguise.

680
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,583
Well, I suppose you and Mr. Booth,
wherever he is,

681
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,125
are here to try to beat me
to the second egg.

682
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,791
<i>- Even the playing field.</i>
- Don't tell her anything.

683
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:26,291
I'm not here for the egg.
I'm here to clear my name,

684
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,541
<i>which means all I need is you.</i>

685
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,250
You're literally telling her everything.

686
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:34,458
We both know that this whole thing
is gonna end with you in handcuffs.

687
00:53:36,166 --> 00:53:39,125
Promises, promises.

688
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:57,583
Careful now. We don't wanna cause a scene.

689
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,500
Don't care.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

690
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,083
Oh, good, you're dancing with her.

691
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,708
Not bad for a convict.

692
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:15,583
Speaking of which,
how's it going with your partner in crime?

693
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:18,083
Has he told you
where the third egg is yet?

694
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:20,041
Well, if he did, I wouldn't tell you.

695
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,583
That's a no. He must not trust you.

696
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,416
You trust your partner?

697
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,666
<i>What makes you think I have one?</i>

698
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,833
Well, no one would be able to pull off
the scores you have alone.

699
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:34,083
It's impossible.

700
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:42,041
So what now?

701
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,083
You're gonna arrest me right here,

702
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:48,416
without a badge or a gun,
outside of your jurisdiction,

703
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,250
and in front of a room full of criminals?

704
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,666
Is that your plan, Agent Hartley?

705
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,583
Shit!

706
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:09,291
<i>Incoming! Got the print.</i>
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

707
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:15,333
Or perhaps you just
didn't think this all the way through.

708
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:21,416
You're coming with me. Party's over.

709
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:31,583
Watching you dance with this man
at my party has made me quite jealous.

710
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,875
Well, I had to get your attention somehow.

711
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,708
Didn't I?

712
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:39,291
May I?

713
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:41,916
Like you said, it's your party.

714
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:47,583
Apologies.

715
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,541
We needed to get his phone,

716
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,833
not waste time
playing footsie with The Bishop.

717
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:57,458
Don't worry. I got it.

718
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,625
Excuse me.

719
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,958
You're kidding. Nice pull!

720
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,750
How'd you know Sotto Voce would cut in?

721
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:09,458
Well, Sotto Voce is a 5'5" alpha male
with textbook Napoleon complex.

722
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:13,666
So any time another male dances with
the most desirable woman at his party,

723
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,666
well, he has no choice
but to step in and assert his dominance.

724
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,708
You sneaky little minx.

725
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:21,708
Where'd you learn that? Profiler school?

726
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:22,791
High school.

727
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:44,041
Ladies and gentlemen,

728
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:49,958
it is my sincere pleasure
to welcome you all to my humble home.

729
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:52,375
Now's the time. He's speechifying.

730
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:54,125
My father
was a man of conviction…

731
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:55,208
Moving to two.

732
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,791
Oh! Terribly, terribly sorry, sir.

733
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,416
You imbecile!

734
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:09,416
- Oh…
- Don't put your hands on me, peasant.

735
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:13,000
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- A thousand apologies.

736
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,458
I don't need your apologies,
I need a washroom.

737
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:16,541
Take him.

738
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,375
Right this way, sir.

739
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:20,208
Let's get you hosed down.

740
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:24,333
This pistol
was my father's prized possession.

741
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:27,583
I've kept it close to my heart
since the day I killed him with it.

742
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:30,541
I was never permitted
to touch this as a boy.

743
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:31,625
Right this way.

744
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:36,708
<i>It's just like the one</i>
<i>used by the Lone Ranger.</i>

745
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,333
Hey.

746
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,166
What's going on there?

747
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,083
Someone spilled wine on a guest.
They're cleared.

748
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:03,333
Something's off. I'm calling it in anyway.

749
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:07,000
- Don't be an idiot.
- You read too many spy novels.

750
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:10,125
{\an8}<i>I miss you every day, Pop-Pop.</i>

751
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:13,166
<i>And in his immortal words,</i>

752
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:18,500
"The skilled hunter needs but one bullet."

753
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,458
- Bravo!
- Enjoy your evening.

754
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,083
No, no, no, no, no.

755
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:26,041
We gotta go.

756
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:50,250
Here we go, nice and easy.

757
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:55,500
Oh, my God!

758
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:57,458
You're like a well-dressed wall.

759
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:58,583
What are you doing?

760
00:59:58,666 --> 00:59:59,750
Trying to ruin the mission.

761
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:02,166
Well, mission accomplished.
Find the print.

762
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,083
God damn it!

763
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:07,166
Come on, come on, come on,
you little bastard. Where are you?

764
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,833
Shit!

765
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,625
Gotcha.

766
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,708
Phone, phone, phone, phone.

767
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,416
Okay, it's deepfake time.

768
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:56,333
Sotto Voce.

769
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:05,083
Right.

770
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,208
I thought
Mr. Voce was still at the party?

771
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,750
Send a team.

772
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:17,166
Security, we have a code red.

773
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:21,125
Hey!

774
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,458
You know,
for a guy who claims he's innocent,

775
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:28,916
you sure do hang around
with a lot of criminals.

776
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,375
I am innocent.

777
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:32,791
He's a pretty damn good thief
for his first time.

778
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,333
- I'm not good at it.
- You are.

779
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:36,041
- Don't say that.
- Don't sell yourself short.

780
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:37,625
- Shut up.
- Hector Deflector over here.

781
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,333
He's not good at taking a compliment.

782
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:42,625
I need you to understand,
The Bishop is behind this entire thing.

783
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,666
She set me up.

784
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,666
Well, if this is all The Bishop's doing
and you really are innocent, prove it.

785
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:52,208
Go on, detain your friend.

786
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,333
We're not friends.

787
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:55,291
- We're work wives.
- We're not work wives.

788
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,208
- We're sister wives.
- We're not any kind of wives.

789
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,416
Shut up! Both of you.

790
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,125
You either arrest him
or I arrest you both.

791
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:06,041
What's it gonna be, Agent Hartley?

792
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,041
- I'm sorry, man.
- Oh…

793
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:14,875
Oh, come on!

794
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:16,541
- You're under arrest.
- You're gonna listen?

795
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,500
After all we've been through together…

796
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:25,541
You love me?

797
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:26,791
I hate you.

798
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:30,666
- Tight enough? Jesus!
- See?

799
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,333
I'm a good guy.

800
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,291
But sometimes I do bad things.

801
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:43,166
- Hartley!
- Let's grab that egg and get out of here.

802
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,000
You don't wanna talk
about what just happened?

803
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,708
- What you talking about?
- We had a moment.

804
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:49,333
- We didn't have a moment.
- No, we had a moment.

805
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,583
Looking for something specific
or just browsing?

806
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:08,916
You look awful.

807
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,041
Hmm. You know, there was an easier way in,

808
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:16,208
but I doubt very much
that you could've managed it.

809
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:20,791
Now that I have two out of the three eggs,

810
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:25,958
I'll give you one last chance
to take me up on my offer.

811
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,625
- Well, here's my counteroffer.
- Mm-hmm.

812
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,125
- You're under arrest.
- Oh, my God.

813
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:31,375
Read the room.

814
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:35,958
I told you, this would end
with you in handcuffs.

815
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:38,541
You're so embarrassing.
He's so embarrassing.

816
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:41,125
Tell you what, Agent Hartley.

817
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,083
You wanna arrest me?

818
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,000
Come…

819
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:49,833
Arrest me.

820
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:52,833
I just want the egg. So, uh...

821
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,416
Take it easy.

822
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,458
This is easy.

823
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,125
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

824
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,875
Sir, we have a problem in the vault room.

825
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:16,458
Excuse me.

826
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,375
Bro, I didn't…
I didn't see the handcuffs coming.

827
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:06,916
Mm, was a nice touch.

828
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,166
God, this is such a confusing erection.

829
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,750
You can't ever tell anybody about this.

830
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,125
- I'll never tell anybody. Promise.
- Okay.

831
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,833
Okay.

832
01:06:18,916 --> 01:06:21,750
Oh, whoa, hold on, hold on.
No, don't shoot.

833
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,750
I'm not trying to be a tattletale.
We didn't steal your egg, okay?

834
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,041
I mean, we tried.

835
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:28,958
But she got it.

836
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:31,208
He's telling you the truth.

837
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:32,875
Is that so?

838
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:37,708
Thank you. Oh. All right.

839
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,958
Would you like to make
a confession, my lady?

840
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,166
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

841
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,250
I told you they'd come.

842
01:06:58,291 --> 01:06:59,625
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

843
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:01,083
What the f...

844
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,583
Good morning, gentlemen.

845
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:32,291
Down here, beneath the bulls,
no one will hear your screams.

846
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:34,291
That's called foreshadowing.

847
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:35,916
- I know what it's called.
- Was making sure.

848
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You don't look like an English major.

849
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:40,875
- Shut up.
<i>- Buongiorno, </i>everybody!

850
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:43,208
- Perfect!
- I brought champagne.

851
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:45,750
I would introduce you,
but I believe you've already met

852
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,250
my lovely business associate.

853
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:48,166
Yes.

854
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,291
I told you The Bishop
was working with somebody.

855
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,541
It's a marriage of convenience.

856
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:55,416
You're familiar with that concept,
aren't you?

857
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:59,708
You see, the dashing Mr. Voce here

858
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,125
already held the second egg
in his possession.

859
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:05,000
So, I approached him with my own offer,

860
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:07,458
which brings us to the part

861
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:12,166
where you tell us where the third egg is.

862
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:21,958
Piss off for a thousand years.

863
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:25,916
Oh, bummer.
I really wanted to do it the easy way.

864
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:31,625
That's okay. I'll get the information
from you by hurting him.

865
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,208
I'm sorry, what?

866
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,666
I love this plan.

867
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:41,333
You two share a special bond.

868
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,833
Otherwise, why would you
risk your lives together

869
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:45,250
attempting to steal the egg?

870
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:48,125
Isn't that right, Agent Hartley?

871
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:50,875
There is no bond between us.
I barely know the guy.

872
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:52,916
Booth, tell her we're not friends.

873
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,791
- She knows about us, pal.
- That's bullshit.

874
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:59,250
She knows about our special bond,
that you were my best man.

875
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:00,375
Son of a bitch. He's lying.

876
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:04,000
If she hurts you bad enough,
if she gets really creative with it,

877
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:06,208
I'm gonna have no choice
but to tell her everything.

878
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:11,333
Now, Mr. Booth, where is the third egg?

879
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:15,583
Okay, here I go.

880
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,250
No, don't. Wait.

881
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:27,375
Oh, my God!

882
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,916
Well…

883
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,833
No.

884
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:36,625
I guess now we find out what kind
of friend you really are, Mr. Booth,

885
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:39,416
because we're gonna go
to my favorite place.

886
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:43,166
No.

887
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,458
No. Don't...

888
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:54,750
Enough games, my love.

889
01:09:55,708 --> 01:10:00,583
If you want to make him talk,
this is how you get him to talk.

890
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:01,750
Why is your shirt off?

891
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,708
- Why is his shirt off?
- I don't know.

892
01:10:03,791 --> 01:10:07,333
Sometimes the old ways are the best.
Excuse me, darling.

893
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:17,541
There, there, Special Agent Hartley.

894
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:23,291
Look! Look at your friend.

895
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:28,750
The egg. Now!

896
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:30,708
Booth, please.

897
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:34,375
Okay, stop, stop.
I'll tell you, all right?

898
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:38,166
- It's in Egypt.
- Where in Egypt?

899
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:40,875
There's a hidden chamber
in the Great Pyramid.

900
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:43,416
Lidar discovered it a year ago.
They haven't opened it yet.

901
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,833
- How do you know the egg is there?
- My mother was an Egyptologist.

902
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:49,333
I could read hieroglyphics
before I could read English.

903
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:52,000
That hidden chamber

904
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,166
is the secret tomb of Cleopatra.

905
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:59,791
They buried the third egg there
when the other two went missing.

906
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:02,416
The scans show it
sitting there plain as day.

907
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:06,250
The third egg never left Egypt.

908
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:11,791
He's not lying. I read about the chamber.

909
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:15,666
Was that so hard?

910
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:20,750
Shall we celebrate?

911
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,458
To the end of our business.

912
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:32,666
And the beginning of our pleasure.

913
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:46,791
- I mean…
- Oh, come on.

914
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:50,166
You didn't see that coming, amateur hour?

915
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,750
Guard!

916
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:55,208
I don't know what happened.
We were just having a glass of champagne

917
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,291
when all of the sudden he fell.

918
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:01,083
And scene.

919
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:02,750
Long con?

920
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:04,250
Long con.

921
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,583
You know, lady,
I'm really starting to not like you.

922
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:11,583
Now I'd really love to stay and see
how this whole thing turns out,

923
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:17,041
but I'm late for a date
with a very large pyramid.

924
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:19,833
Can't wait to see what happens next.

925
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:21,250
So exciting!

926
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:31,708
She's a good singer.

927
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:34,666
You should have took that deal
when she offered it to you in prison.

928
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,875
Well, you shouldn't have
got us caught by her boyfriend.

929
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,541
Oh, how did I get us caught
by her boyfriend?

930
01:12:38,625 --> 01:12:41,083
Well, if you don't know that,
then you really are dumber than I look.

931
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:45,416
Jesus! That's really scary.

932
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:53,333
Oh, you look busted.
You look like a zombie.

933
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,333
You did this.

934
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:59,666
This is your fault. She was mine.

935
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,291
Honey, honey, honey,
homegirl is a hard ten.

936
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:05,666
And you look like…

937
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:08,500
Like a muscular toddler.

938
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,791
I don't think it was gonna work.

939
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:13,666
- The height difference and…
- Oh, shit.

940
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:19,000
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

941
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:21,083
Let's talk about this.

942
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:25,875
- John, you hit?
- No, surprisingly not.

943
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:28,083
What? How is that possible?

944
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,791
How did you get free?

945
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,791
- He shot the cuff.
- He hit something?

946
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:41,416
Lucky shot.

947
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,791
We're gonna get out of here.

948
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:44,666
We're really gonna do it.

949
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:48,125
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, where are you goin'? We're partners.

950
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,583
Oh, we're partners now?
No, our partnership ended

951
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:53,208
when you let The Bishop
go all shock therapy on me.

952
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:55,833
You're not gonna find The Bishop.
Not without me.

953
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:58,333
I got a pretty good idea
where she's going because of you.

954
01:13:58,416 --> 01:14:00,541
- So, goodbye.
- I lied.

955
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,000
- I lied.
- What do you mean, "you lied"?

956
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:09,083
I lied about everything.
All of it. That whole thing.

957
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:12,000
I lied to you, I lied to her,
I lied to Baby Jesus.

958
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:13,625
All of 'em.

959
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:20,750
Look, the point is,
is that the third egg isn't in Egypt.

960
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,541
Right. I don't give a shit about the egg.

961
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,416
I care about arresting The Bishop
and clearing my name.

962
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,583
Right. But you won't get to The Bishop
unless you get to the egg.

963
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:30,250
And I know where the egg is.

964
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,291
Just get me out of here.

965
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:34,500
I'll get the egg
and you'll get The Bishop.

966
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:36,916
Come on!

967
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,416
Pretty please?

968
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,000
Thoughts?

969
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,250
You hear that?

970
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,750
Hey, hey, hey.

971
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:03,500
Up here.

972
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:07,000
We'll disappear into the crowd.
We'll be home free.

973
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:24,916
Oh, shit!

974
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,291
I think we're gonna get out of here.

975
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,125
Shit!

976
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,666
- No, no. Don't move. Don't move.
- Why?

977
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,708
Bulls have terrible eyesight.
But they can sense motion.

978
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:42,208
You're thinking of <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

979
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:45,708
No! I saw a nature documentary
starring David Attenborough.

980
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,958
You're thinking of Richard Attenborough
from <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

981
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:56,083
<i>Vámonos. Vámonos.</i>
They're telling me to run.

982
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:58,125
If you run, you die.

983
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:02,666
All right, yes or no,
was Jeff Goldblum in it?

984
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,750
Oh, my God! It was <i>Jurassic Park.</i>
That's Jeff Goldblum.

985
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:06,750
Asshole!

986
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:15,333
Run, run, run, run, run
or you will die!

987
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,041
A-ha...

988
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:30,791
Ah.

989
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:33,291
Thank you!

990
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,333
What's your problem?

991
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Don't run?

992
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:41,958
Don't run?

993
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,000
You gonna be
this grumpy the whole trip?

994
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:47,166
Wait till you see our ride.
You're gonna love it.

995
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,750
This is fun, isn't it?

996
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:01,000
Riding the rails hobo-style.

997
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:04,166
You ever see, um, uh, <i>Sullivan's Travels?</i>

998
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,708
No, I haven't.

999
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:07,833
And no, it's not, all right? Cough it up.

1000
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,708
Where are we headed?
Where's the third egg?

1001
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,416
All right, fine.

1002
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,041
I've been thinking about this a lot,
and I can't tell you.

1003
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,208
What do you mean, you can't tell me?

1004
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:20,083
It's not so much of a "can't,"
it's more of a "won't."

1005
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:25,375
Take me to the third egg, Booth.

1006
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:32,083
You wanna do it?

1007
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,541
Do it.

1008
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:36,583
You can't, can you?

1009
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:40,000
'Cause even though you're
running around with me, playing the thief,

1010
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:42,916
you're not a real bad guy, Bubba.

1011
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,833
Let's get something straight right now.

1012
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,416
That was terrifying.

1013
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:03,791
Look, it's not that
I don't care about you.

1014
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:06,041
It's that I don't care about anyone.

1015
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:09,416
My dad was a crook.

1016
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:13,083
A con man, actually.

1017
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:16,375
He was the best.

1018
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:20,833
Then on my 13th birthday,
he didn't show up.

1019
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,291
My mom and I never saw him again.

1020
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:28,750
Wow.

1021
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:32,916
We really got some dads, huh?

1022
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,041
It's a miracle we're not both strippers.

1023
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:36,833
Yeah.

1024
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:43,666
Look, your dad was a cop,
so you became a crook.

1025
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:46,583
My dad was a crook, so I became a cop.

1026
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,500
We're not that different.

1027
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:51,291
I'm not asking you
to care about me, Booth.

1028
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:53,791
I'm asking you to help me.

1029
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:58,625
Help me catch The Bishop
and clear my name,

1030
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:02,916
and I will help you become the number one
art thief in the world again.

1031
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:07,250
It's the only chance I have
to get my life back.

1032
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:09,291
Please.

1033
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,791
April, 1945.

1034
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:27,625
<i>The Red Army's at the gate,
days from taking Berlin.</i>

1035
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:30,041
<i>It's game over for the Nazis,</i>

1036
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:33,416
<i>and that's when a forgotten Mr. Nobody
named Rudolph Zeich,</i>

1037
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,166
<i>Hitler's personal
art and antiquities dealer,</i>

1038
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,916
<i>and the only man ever rumored
to have held Cleopatra's third egg</i>

1039
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,583
<i>in his hands,</i>

1040
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:45,583
<i>hopped a steamer ship
and fled Germany for Argentina.</i>

1041
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:48,333
<i>The manifest shows
he traveled with just a single suitcase.</i>

1042
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:55,333
<i>Oh, and sixteen five-ton cargo containers
logged only as holding machine parts.</i>

1043
01:19:57,375 --> 01:20:00,291
<i>Now, why would an art dealer
leave his patron's side</i>

1044
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,791
<i>and travel halfway around the globe,</i>

1045
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:06,041
<i>with nearly 100 tons
of so-called machine parts?</i>

1046
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:10,208
<i>For 70 years,
amateur sleuths, treasure hunters,</i>

1047
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:14,083
<i>and adult virgins everywhere
became obsessed with this question,</i>

1048
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:20,208
<i>obsessed with finding what they believed
had to be Hitler's lost bunker,</i>

1049
01:20:20,291 --> 01:20:23,083
<i>hidden somewhere in South America.</i>

1050
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,583
<i>And my dad was one of them.</i>

1051
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:30,583
<i>He'd spend weekends
holed up in his office,</i>

1052
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:33,375
<i>poring over old maps
and declassified files.</i>

1053
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:37,708
<i>Holidays, he'd drive hours away
to obscure auctions,</i>

1054
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,958
<i>where he'd bid on the strangest things.</i>

1055
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:45,666
<i>Including a watch.</i>

1056
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:54,583
<i>And not just any watch.
Creepy Nazi art guy Rudolph Zeich's watch.</i>

1057
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,791
<i>That same watch
my father chose to love more than me.</i>

1058
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,958
<i>What a dick.</i>

1059
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:07,000
<i>Never wanted anything to do
with his treasure hunt,</i>

1060
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:08,458
<i>even after he passed.</i>

1061
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:11,958
<i>That was my father's thing,
and he could have it.</i>

1062
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:23,916
<i>But when I discovered what was inside it,</i>

1063
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:28,916
<i>I knew right then that I held in my hand</i>

1064
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,750
<i>the secret to the third egg's location.</i>

1065
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,625
Booth,
you've had me traveling for three days

1066
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,125
and hiking in circles for eight hours.

1067
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:08,750
That map better be right.

1068
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,000
Relax, we'll find it.

1069
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,750
Say we find it.

1070
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:14,916
How can you be sure
the egg is actually there?

1071
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,166
- What do you mean?
- I get that Rudolph the red-nosed Nazi guy

1072
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:21,166
is rumored to be the last person
to ever hold the egg in his hands,

1073
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:25,666
and that this mystery bunker is rumored
to have all this stolen treasure.

1074
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:28,708
How can you be sure
the third egg itself is actually there?

1075
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:29,625
Faith.

1076
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:32,750
Faith?

1077
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:34,291
I'm sorry, I just wanna be clear.

1078
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:37,541
So we're out in the middle of nowhere
based on faith?

1079
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,458
Or "gut vibe" if you're
not into the whole religious thing.

1080
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:41,375
No.

1081
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,708
You know, the kinda thing I'm into
is a good plan.

1082
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:47,083
A smart plan, the opposite of this.

1083
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:50,250
Relax. I have good news.
If I'm reading this map right…

1084
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:52,666
We're here.

1085
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,083
- We're where?
- We've arrived.

1086
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:55,208
X marks the spot.

1087
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:58,041
X… What spot? X marks the spot.

1088
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,416
We're here. Here it is. Great job!

1089
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,875
- Please don't yell at me.
- You found it! Booth found it.

1090
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:04,750
There's no bunker. There's shit here.

1091
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:06,958
- I'm just telling you what the map says.
- There's no bunker.

1092
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:08,416
Tell me, what does the map say?

1093
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,125
Oh, shit!

1094
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:14,916
Yeah, it's gonna be a long walk back.

1095
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:17,875
You know what I blame?
I blame the compass.

1096
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:20,541
I got this thing back in Scouts.
It's been a little wonky.

1097
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:22,208
It was never my strong suit.

1098
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:23,416
- Can I see this?
- Absolutely.

1099
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,708
- Can I see this?
- Of course.

1100
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,375
I see what the problem is.

1101
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:29,916
- That's the problem.
- Oh. That is not kind.

1102
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,583
You know what's not kind?
Dragging me out in the middle of nowhere,

1103
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:35,166
halfway around the world,
based on a goddamn hunch!

1104
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:31,000
Holy shit!

1105
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:02,583
Guess they're paying the utilities.

1106
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:06,041
It's gotta be hydroelectric power,

1107
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:09,083
which means there's
running water somewhere down here.

1108
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,750
Look at that door.
Nothing hiding behind there.

1109
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:21,291
How are we gonna get through this?

1110
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:28,041
Oh, shit!

1111
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,375
You have got to be kidding.

1112
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:39,833
Is that your father's watch?

1113
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:43,083
No. It's the watch from <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

1114
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:45,375
Yes, it's my father's watch.

1115
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:49,458
- I thought you said you smashed it.
- I had it repaired. Is that a problem?

1116
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:52,125
No, it's not a problem.
Glad you're not touchy about it.

1117
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:53,208
Please shut up.

1118
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:59,250
Uh, fun with magnets. All right.

1119
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:12,833
Dad…

1120
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:16,875
Please be good crazy.

1121
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:22,208
Forget the egg,
let's just steal this stuff.

1122
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:24,166
We're not here to steal anything.

1123
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:27,375
Uh, actually we are.
We're here to steal the egg.

1124
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:28,666
You know what I mean.

1125
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,083
Oh, I steal it, it's stealing,
and you steal it, it's what?

1126
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:34,250
How about we just shut up?
And by we, I mean you.

1127
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:35,791
You're also rude too.

1128
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:38,666
{\an8}Rude to boot.

1129
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:41,541
How are we gonna find this egg?

1130
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,833
I don't know.

1131
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:45,750
Look for a box that says "MacGuffin."

1132
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:03,791
Oh!

1133
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:05,333
Do you know what this is?

1134
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,708
This is…

1135
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:12,875
Yes, this is
a 1931 Mercedes-Benz Grosser 770.

1136
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:16,041
I could flip this for $25 million, easy.

1137
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:18,625
There's, like, three of these left
on the planet. Four!

1138
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,000
There's four now.

1139
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:22,458
Three quarter-inch steel,

1140
01:28:22,541 --> 01:28:25,125
reinforced armor-plating,
bullet-resistant glass,

1141
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:27,625
and a 24-karat gold inlay.

1142
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:29,833
This is a convertible tank.

1143
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:32,833
And it's in mint condition.
I bet you this thing still runs.

1144
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:34,750
Too bad it was driven by Nazi scum.

1145
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:36,333
It's a shame we're gonna have to burn it.

1146
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:38,250
How did they get it down here anyway?

1147
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:41,416
They carry it down the stairs
in tiny pieces and reassemble?

1148
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,416
Through there.

1149
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:47,416
Place must have been built off
one of those old copper mines.

1150
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,208
The shafts down here are massive
and go on for miles.

1151
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:53,958
Build the bunker, bring in the loot,
seal the shaft…

1152
01:28:54,041 --> 01:28:55,083
Bob's your uncle.

1153
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,000
Who's your daddy?

1154
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,708
That's not how it goes.

1155
01:28:58,791 --> 01:28:59,875
I know.

1156
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:08,458
{\an8}Well, labels, Nazis, dum-dums.

1157
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:29,833
Five-second rule.

1158
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:33,791
It's fine. Totally fine.
Not a scratch on it.

1159
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:36,625
Are you sure you don't wanna
flip this one? I got a guy.

1160
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:38,416
Let me save you the trouble.

1161
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,916
Your entrances are bullshit.

1162
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,375
Egypt?

1163
01:29:45,041 --> 01:29:48,458
Did you really think I ran right off
to the pyramids on your good word?

1164
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:51,500
All I had to do was wait for you two
to escape from Sotto Voce,

1165
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,750
and you led me right to the third egg,

1166
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:55,875
which I'm going to take from you now.

1167
01:29:56,666 --> 01:29:59,333
So, uh, hand it over.

1168
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,916
Come on, don't be shy.

1169
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:07,583
Good job. Attaboy.

1170
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:10,833
Drop your weapon!

1171
01:30:14,958 --> 01:30:16,791
This way! On that side.

1172
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,291
How did she find us?

1173
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,791
I followed you. She must have followed me.

1174
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:27,791
No shit!

1175
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:33,458
Why are you shooting at them?
I thought you were on their side.

1176
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:35,666
I am on their side. They shot at me first.

1177
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,166
How are we gonna get out of here?

1178
01:30:41,916 --> 01:30:42,833
We take that.

1179
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:45,583
I don't think that's
gonna make it up the stairs.

1180
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:48,500
It ain't going up the stairs.

1181
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:51,166
Cover us.

1182
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,416
- Go, go, go!
- I'm trying!

1183
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,500
Let's go.

1184
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,916
Huh? Ha-ha!

1185
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:30,791
Let's go!

1186
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:34,375
- Throw it.
- What?

1187
01:31:34,458 --> 01:31:35,291
Now!

1188
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,166
You two with me, the rest of you follow.

1189
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,083
Go!

1190
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,250
I'm all out.

1191
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:35,416
Pull over!

1192
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:57,500
Shit!

1193
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:03,916
Whoa!

1194
01:33:33,416 --> 01:33:34,916
Bishop, the egg!

1195
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,458
You saved me.

1196
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:43,500
You love me. You love me like crazy.

1197
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:52,958
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Shit!

1198
01:34:58,208 --> 01:34:59,458
We're running out of road.

1199
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:02,916
Hold on to something!
If we stop, they'll catch us.

1200
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,583
Then let's get caught.

1201
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:07,416
We can escape later.
It works for me all the time.

1202
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,666
Make sure to kick clear of the car.

1203
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:12,333
- I would like to workshop this idea.
- Oh, shit!

1204
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:14,291
It's just like we drew it up, right?

1205
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:17,375
Hartley?

1206
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:21,083
Hartley?

1207
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,458
Hartley?

1208
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,166
You will be missed.

1209
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:51,125
Oh, shit! God damn it.

1210
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,125
Hartley?

1211
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:56,000
Hartley? Hartley?

1212
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:58,708
Hey, where are you, you big idiot?

1213
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:00,375
Who are you calling an idiot?

1214
01:37:01,541 --> 01:37:02,458
I'm right here.

1215
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,291
- Did you just choose me over the egg?
- No.

1216
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:14,791
- Well, it kinda looks like you did.
- I didn't.

1217
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:16,541
You went running in there to rescue me.

1218
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:18,041
I left my phone in there.

1219
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:21,000
You only have
a finite amount of time to save it.

1220
01:37:21,083 --> 01:37:23,000
Stick it in a bag of rice,
it's a whole thing.

1221
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:24,291
You thought I was dead.

1222
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:26,291
I didn't think you were dead.
I wished you were dead.

1223
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:28,958
I saw you splashing around.
"Hartley! Hartley!"

1224
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:31,791
Yes, okay, I wanted to pull you out,

1225
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:35,250
save you, get your hopes up,
and then pull you, shove you under.

1226
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:52,291
Look, I'm not gonna
make a big deal out of this.

1227
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:55,250
I'm not gonna gloat. It's not who I am.

1228
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:57,791
Would some people say
that this is very embarrassing for you?

1229
01:37:57,875 --> 01:37:59,958
Yes, of course. Of course they would.

1230
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:02,125
Probably everybody.

1231
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:04,541
But that's not important right now.

1232
01:38:04,625 --> 01:38:08,000
What's important is that
you realize you lost and I won.

1233
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:08,916
We.

1234
01:38:09,791 --> 01:38:13,125
We won. Together. Friendship. Teamwork.

1235
01:38:13,208 --> 01:38:14,875
It's called the moral of the story.

1236
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:18,041
And something that I've been
wanting to say for years

1237
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:19,541
to your face is…

1238
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:21,500
Checkmate.

1239
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:23,625
Oh, that feels good.

1240
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:26,291
I've got two eggs, you've got one,
and you think you won?

1241
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:28,708
How's that work exactly?

1242
01:38:28,791 --> 01:38:31,333
I don't have to win
in order for you to lose.

1243
01:38:31,416 --> 01:38:33,500
That's the best part of this whole thing.

1244
01:38:33,583 --> 01:38:36,416
As long as I have the third egg,
you can't win.

1245
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,708
I don't care about the money anymore.

1246
01:38:38,791 --> 01:38:40,416
Honestly, look at your face right now.

1247
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,583
That face right there.
Just… Yeah. Perfect.

1248
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:46,666
Resting failure face.
I mean, in a word, priceless.

1249
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:48,625
Also, it just gets better.

1250
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:51,541
As an added bonus,
my friend here, at no extra charge,

1251
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:55,500
is gonna give you
a lifetime supply of prison.

1252
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:58,500
So… That's-a nice.

1253
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:00,708
- Stand up.
- Stand up.

1254
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:07,833
Told you how this was gonna end.

1255
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:25,750
You're right. I am the bad guy.

1256
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:28,625
I know how a confidence scheme works,
trust me.

1257
01:39:28,708 --> 01:39:30,083
You don't know me, Booth.

1258
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:33,208
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

1259
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,083
What the fuck?

1260
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:41,916
Look at him.

1261
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,708
Resting failure face. Priceless.

1262
01:39:45,291 --> 01:39:47,208
This whole time you were working for her?

1263
01:39:47,291 --> 01:39:48,666
Not for, with.

1264
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:51,833
- Like partners.
- Yeah, we're both The Bishop.

1265
01:39:51,916 --> 01:39:53,875
Has he told you
where the third egg is yet?

1266
01:39:56,875 --> 01:39:58,791
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1267
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:00,041
- Ready?
- Yep.

1268
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:02,541
Surprise!

1269
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,083
There are two bishops in chess.

1270
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:08,416
- And a whole lotta pawns.
- Hmm.

1271
01:40:09,666 --> 01:40:12,375
<i>I passed the first egg</i>
<i>on to her in Bali.</i>

1272
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:14,208
She took the second egg from Sotto Voce.

1273
01:40:14,291 --> 01:40:17,291
And the third egg, well,
the only way for us to get our hands on it

1274
01:40:17,375 --> 01:40:20,083
was if you led us right to it,
which you did.

1275
01:40:20,166 --> 01:40:22,166
I thought for sure
you were gonna see through my

1276
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:24,125
"We're not partners,
I gotta clear my name,

1277
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:26,125
I'm Johnny Law, blah, blah, blah."

1278
01:40:26,666 --> 01:40:29,208
To be honest, I thought
I laid it on too thick in the prison.

1279
01:40:29,291 --> 01:40:31,833
- No, honey, you were so good.
- No? Really?

1280
01:40:31,916 --> 01:40:34,666
Appreciate that. What'd you think?
You think it was too much?

1281
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:37,250
I have notes. Otherwise, pretty good.

1282
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:38,500
"Pretty good"? All right.

1283
01:40:38,583 --> 01:40:41,291
Let's just rewind for one second here.

1284
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:45,041
You electrocuted him. You went "Downtown."

1285
01:40:45,125 --> 01:40:46,666
Yes. By the way, that hurt like hell.

1286
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:50,500
I know. I'm so sorry. I had to.

1287
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:54,250
No.

1288
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:57,333
<i>It was the only way I could</i>
<i>pass you a key to slip the cuffs.</i>

1289
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:00,708
How did you get free?

1290
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:04,750
Well, anyhoo, the egg.

1291
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:05,791
The egg.

1292
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:07,750
That gun is soaking wet. There's no way...

1293
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:09,041
I'm not a Navy SEAL.

1294
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:13,083
Third egg.

1295
01:41:13,916 --> 01:41:15,916
- Thank you.
- Let's take a walk.

1296
01:41:21,458 --> 01:41:25,083
So it was all a lie?
Even the sob story about your dad?

1297
01:41:25,166 --> 01:41:28,541
No. My dad was a con man, and I hated him.

1298
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:31,958
So I decided to become better
than he ever was.

1299
01:41:32,041 --> 01:41:33,333
Beat him at his own game.

1300
01:41:35,333 --> 01:41:37,416
Booth, don't be too hard on yourself.

1301
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:40,125
You're good,
really good, better than most.

1302
01:41:40,708 --> 01:41:42,458
We got nothing but respect for you.

1303
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:44,750
Better luck next time.

1304
01:41:44,833 --> 01:41:48,416
We'd love to stay and chat,
but we have an important wedding to attend

1305
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:51,625
and it turns out,
we have the perfect gift.

1306
01:41:52,208 --> 01:41:53,666
No hard feelings, pal.

1307
01:41:55,166 --> 01:41:56,291
It's what we do.

1308
01:41:56,958 --> 01:41:59,458
None taken. Super fun time, guys.

1309
01:42:00,333 --> 01:42:02,583
See, I always appreciate
a quality double-cross.

1310
01:42:03,458 --> 01:42:05,458
Serious question though,
you guys have any sunblock?

1311
01:42:05,541 --> 01:42:07,625
I have no base. This is a spray tan.

1312
01:42:16,791 --> 01:42:22,083
A beautiful event like tonight
happens only once in a father's life.

1313
01:42:22,791 --> 01:42:27,208
That is why when I arranged
for my only daughter to marry,

1314
01:42:27,291 --> 01:42:32,250
I spared no expense
to acquire a gift unlike any other.

1315
01:42:37,416 --> 01:42:40,125
A gift fit for a queen,

1316
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:43,041
my Cleopatra.

1317
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:48,958
Behold,
for the first time in two millennia,

1318
01:42:49,041 --> 01:42:52,333
all three treasured eggs
have been reunited.

1319
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:12,666
Oh, my God! Ed…

1320
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:15,875
Ed Sheeran!

1321
01:43:17,166 --> 01:43:18,583
I love you!

1322
01:43:20,583 --> 01:43:22,458
Ed Sheeran, who knew?

1323
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:23,791
God, he's so cute.

1324
01:43:35,333 --> 01:43:36,291
Yeah, I like that guy.

1325
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:39,000
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>This is an Interpol police action.</i>

1326
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:41,791
<i>Remain in your seats.
This will be over shortly.</i>

1327
01:43:44,916 --> 01:43:45,916
What are you doing?

1328
01:43:47,958 --> 01:43:49,416
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1329
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:53,125
- Oh, my God. Don't touch me. Excuse me!
- Oi!

1330
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:56,875
Come on, then. Come on! Come on!

1331
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:02,041
We'll take those. Thank you very much.

1332
01:44:02,625 --> 01:44:04,375
Let's get out of here.

1333
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:09,000
Possession of stolen Nazi loot is a crime.

1334
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:11,125
You're under arrest, father of the bride.

1335
01:44:11,208 --> 01:44:13,166
This is outrageous.

1336
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:19,000
Get off me.
Do you know who I am?

1337
01:44:19,583 --> 01:44:21,166
I was in <i>Game of Thrones!</i>

1338
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:23,333
I'm Ed Sheeran, bitch!

1339
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:51,416
This gouda is disappointing.

1340
01:44:52,750 --> 01:44:55,708
Such a fancy yacht, you'd think
they could stock some decent cheeses.

1341
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:59,500
That's not cheese. That's uncooked pork.

1342
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:03,916
I've heard tapeworms
can be quite slimming.

1343
01:45:04,583 --> 01:45:06,000
Surprised to see me?

1344
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:08,500
Well, we're just surprised
it took you so long to find us.

1345
01:45:08,583 --> 01:45:10,625
Oh, I actually… I came aboard yesterday.

1346
01:45:11,291 --> 01:45:14,000
You weren't the only one crying
at the end of your lovemaking.

1347
01:45:14,083 --> 01:45:17,166
<i>You know, funny story,
after Das picked me up on the beach…</i>

1348
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:18,500
Looks like you ran out of friends.

1349
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:21,375
<i>She sent me to the only place</i>
<i>on Earth that actually is worse</i>

1350
01:45:21,458 --> 01:45:22,750
<i>than her Instagram account.</i>

1351
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:25,333
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1352
01:45:25,416 --> 01:45:27,958
<i>that I'm pretty good
at escaping from things.</i>

1353
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:29,666
<i>So I did.</i>

1354
01:45:33,666 --> 01:45:36,583
Look, am I upset about
what happened back on the beach?

1355
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:39,416
Absolutely not.
All's fair in love and eggs.

1356
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,291
I came to congratulate you both.

1357
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:43,250
Great. Glad you approve. What do you want?

1358
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:46,125
Well, I'm big on forgiveness.
I always have been.

1359
01:45:46,208 --> 01:45:47,708
But I'm not so big on forget-ness.

1360
01:45:47,791 --> 01:45:49,333
What are you talking about?

1361
01:45:50,958 --> 01:45:52,791
I'm talking about my twist ending.

1362
01:45:52,875 --> 01:45:55,000
You know the 300 million
you guys got on the eggs

1363
01:45:55,083 --> 01:45:56,708
before you double-crossed the billionaire?

1364
01:45:56,791 --> 01:45:58,208
Nice touch, by the way.

1365
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:00,625
Anyhow, I gave our friend,
Inspector Das, a little jingle

1366
01:46:00,708 --> 01:46:03,125
and I tipped her off about
that secure Cayman Island account

1367
01:46:03,208 --> 01:46:04,125
you stashed it in.

1368
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:06,833
Turns out,
it's not as secure as one might hope.

1369
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:10,708
Take it all.

1370
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:16,958
See? Now, we're even.

1371
01:46:17,666 --> 01:46:20,708
Everyone loses, no one gets the money
and we can all be friends again.

1372
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,458
Cut the shit. What's the offer?

1373
01:46:22,541 --> 01:46:23,583
There's a new score.

1374
01:46:23,666 --> 01:46:26,625
Double the payout, triple the challenge,
plus, here's the best part.

1375
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:29,708
It's a three-thief job.
One, two, three.

1376
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:31,750
And let me guess, if we don't say yes,

1377
01:46:31,833 --> 01:46:34,208
then Inspector Das is on her way
right now to arrest us.

1378
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:36,083
Yes, in very fast boats.

1379
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:38,000
Know what I think is funny, Booth?

1380
01:46:38,083 --> 01:46:41,125
Vin Diesel's audition tape for <i>Cats?</i>
It exists.

1381
01:46:41,208 --> 01:46:44,208
The fact that you think
the two of us would ever team up with you.

1382
01:46:44,291 --> 01:46:45,291
Get off the boat.

1383
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:48,208
Great. I'll, uh, send you both
a sharpened toothbrush.

1384
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:51,125
Wait, stop.

1385
01:46:53,875 --> 01:46:56,375
Look,
we need a new score now anyway.

1386
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:58,958
I know he drives you crazy, but he's good.

1387
01:46:59,041 --> 01:47:01,500
- And you two work well together.
- No, we don't.

1388
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:02,875
We kinda do.

1389
01:47:04,166 --> 01:47:05,541
Do you trust me?

1390
01:47:06,166 --> 01:47:07,000
Always.

1391
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:09,708
- You love me?
- Big time.

1392
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,166
That's all we need.

1393
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:15,833
What are we stealing?

1394
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,333
This.

1395
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:47,166
It's abandoned.
They're not here.

1396
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,333
Ready?

1397
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:10,541
