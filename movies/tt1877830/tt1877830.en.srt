Hey!

4
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,415
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

5
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:08,422
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

6
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:10,049
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

7
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,468
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

8
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:16,388
<i>and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

9
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:17,973
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

10
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:21,519
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

11
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:25,648
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

12
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:27,483
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

13
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,319
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

14
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:31,862
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

15
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:36,117
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,994
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

17
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:40,454
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

18
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:41,455
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

19
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,791
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

20
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:44,917
<i>Under my administration,</i>

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,796
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

22
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,383
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

23
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,760
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

24
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:55,803
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

25
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,179
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

26
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:58,222
<i>But listen...</i>

27
00:02:58,305 --> 00:02:59,723
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

28
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:01,267
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

29
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:06,772
Hey.

30
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,943
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

31
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,825
Why is she still tied?

32
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:25,416
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

33
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,925
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

34
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,886
Just call me in the morning, okay?

35
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:42,516
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

36
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,144
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

37
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:47,897
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

38
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:09,687
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

39
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:25,286
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

40
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,124
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

41
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:37,089
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

42
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,092
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

43
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:43,095
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

44
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:45,848
<i>Watching.</i>

45
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:51,854
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

46
00:05:57,234 --> 00:06:00,029
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

47
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,503
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

48
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,297
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

49
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,882
<i>It's a big city.</i>

50
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:26,222
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

51
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,734
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

52
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,658
Look at this guy, man.

53
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:51,831
Boom!

54
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:53,165
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

55
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,754
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

56
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:00,256
Yo, let's see your hits.

57
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,466
That's you.

58
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:26,866
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

59
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,828
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

60
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:33,706
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

61
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,834
<i>It's a warning.</i>

62
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:39,628
<i>To them.</i>

63
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:50,556
<i>Fear...</i>

64
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:55,686
<i>is a tool.</i>

65
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:09,950
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

66
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:24,340
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

67
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:28,302
Come on!

68
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,646
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

69
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:58,999
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

70
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:01,460
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

71
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,003
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

72
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:05,214
Help!

73
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:06,507
Somebody help me!

74
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,301
Help, help!

75
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:17,393
Where you goin', huh?

76
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:23,149
Come on.

77
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:24,900
Come on, man. Break it.

78
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:28,487
You can't move, huh?

79
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:30,573
Now knock his ass out.

80
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:32,366
Showtime. Showtime, man.

81
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:33,993
Come on, man.

82
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:35,327
Come on. Do it, man.

83
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:12,281
You see this guy?

84
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:21,123
The hell are you supposed to be?

85
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,433
I'm vengeance.

86
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,478
Holy shit. It's him.

87
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,296
Hey, man. No, no, no!

88
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,423
Please don't hurt me.

89
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,044
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

90
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,838
Police action.

91
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:35,091
He's with me, Officer.

92
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:38,928
Are you kidding me, sir?

93
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:41,597
You're gonna let him in here?

94
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:45,059
Martinez, let him through.

95
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:00,449
Goddamn freak.

96
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,425
What do we know?

97
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,645
Detective?

98
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:31,355
Sorry, Lieutenant.

99
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:36,736
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

100
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:40,656
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

101
00:13:43,826 --> 00:13:45,453
All this blood is from his head?

102
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:46,912
No.

103
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,460
Excuse me.

104
00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:56,630
Most of it's from his hand.

105
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:03,137
Thumb was severed.

106
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,974
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

107
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:09,268
He was alive when it was cut off.

108
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:11,979
Ecchymosis...

109
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,774
around the wound.

110
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:31,707
Security detail downstairs

111
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,001
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

112
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:37,713
The mayor was up here alone.

113
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:42,843
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

114
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,018
You said there was a card.

115
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:52,686
Yeah.

116
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:05,866
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

117
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,869
Haven't a clue?

118
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:11,330
Let's play a game, just me and you.

119
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:14,917
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

120
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:18,337
There's a cipher too.

121
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:26,971
Any of this mean anything to you?

122
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:30,724
What's going on here?

123
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:35,229
I asked him to come, Pete.

124
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:36,981
This is a crime scene.

125
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:39,400
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

126
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:41,485
I got the press downstairs.

127
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,321
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

128
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,240
But this is way over the line.

129
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,995
Wait.

130
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:52,788
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

131
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:53,998
How do you know?

132
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:57,084
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

133
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:58,919
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

134
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:00,629
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

135
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:02,256
He lies still.

136
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:04,759
Excuse me?

137
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:07,386
The riddle.

138
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,390
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

139
00:16:20,524 --> 00:16:22,026
Oh, Jesus.

140
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,074
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

141
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,910
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

142
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:33,329
Excuse me, Commissioner.

143
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:36,082
They're ready for your statement.

144
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:41,837
I want him outta here.

145
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:43,547
Now!

146
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,347
Come on.

147
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:05,361
Yeah.

148
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,030
The kid found him.

149
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:16,038
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

150
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:34,640
We really gotta go, man.

151
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:43,941
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

152
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,235
A wife lost a husband.

153
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:48,988
And I lost a friend.

154
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:52,616
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

155
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,786
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

156
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:58,414
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

157
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:02,585
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

158
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:06,756
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

159
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,090
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

160
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:11,010
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

161
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:12,678
<i>but I don't know.</i>

162
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:21,479
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

163
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,647
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

164
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:25,733
<i>And now this.</i>

165
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:29,487
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

166
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:33,449
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

167
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:37,828
<i>But I have to try.</i>

168
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:39,872
<i>Push myself.</i>

169
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,462
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

170
00:19:29,422 --> 00:19:31,340
<i>behind the mask.</i>

171
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:38,139
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

172
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:42,101
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

173
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:46,063
<i>everything that happened.</i>

174
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:02,204
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

175
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:06,167
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

176
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,086
<i>was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

177
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,921
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

178
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:12,673
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

179
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:14,258
<i>still have not been released,</i>

180
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:17,219
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

181
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:20,556
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

182
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:22,475
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

183
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,102
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

184
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:29,440
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

185
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:31,275
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

186
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:33,319
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

187
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:36,238
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

188
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:40,159
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

189
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:42,036
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

190
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:44,789
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

191
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:48,125
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

192
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:52,171
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

193
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:56,425
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

194
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:57,927
I assume you heard about this.

195
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:01,055
Yeah.

196
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,396
Oh, I see.

197
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:12,149
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

198
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:13,901
Dear God.

199
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,703
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

200
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:35,005
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

201
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,969
The killer left this for the Batman?

202
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,055
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

203
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:44,140
Apparently.

204
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:46,308
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

205
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:49,687
Why is he writing to you?

206
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,188
<i>It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!</i>

207
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:52,314
I don't know yet.

208
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,941
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

209
00:21:55,818 --> 00:21:57,236
Have a shower.

210
00:21:58,696 --> 00:22:00,364
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

211
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,365
are coming for breakfast.

212
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:03,451
Here? Why?

213
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:04,618
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

214
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:05,786
I haven't got time for this.

215
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,538
It's getting serious, Bruce.

216
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:10,708
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

217
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,376
I don't care about that.

218
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:14,170
Any of that.

219
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:15,755
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

220
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:21,260
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

221
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:23,512
If I can't change things here,

222
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:25,973
if I can't have an effect,

223
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:28,684
then I don't care what happens to me.

224
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:29,894
That's what I'm afraid of.

225
00:22:29,977 --> 00:22:31,604
Alfred, stop.

226
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,440
You're not my father.

227
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:38,652
I'm well aware.

228
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:15,231
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

229
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:42,466
Some fresh berries there.

230
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,766
What are you doing?

231
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:54,812
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

232
00:23:55,187 --> 00:23:59,108
This is actually quite elusive.

233
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:03,779
Where'd you get those O's?

234
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:08,117
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

235
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,619
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

236
00:24:10,703 --> 00:24:14,749
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

237
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:16,208
see where it leads.

238
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:19,128
That's interesting.

239
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:21,505
Mr. Pennyworth?

240
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:22,882
Yes, Dory?

241
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:24,675
The accountants are here.

242
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,594
See them in, please, Dory.

243
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:31,724
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

244
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:33,392
What do you mean?

245
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:35,311
What if this is the whole key?

246
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:38,773
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

247
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:40,900
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

248
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:42,151
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

249
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:44,361
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

250
00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:46,280
I don't see how that's gonna...

251
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:49,825
Oh.

252
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:05,299
Damn.

253
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:07,718
Yeah, he's got a car.

254
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:11,013
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

255
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:12,765
Where to even start?

256
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:15,684
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

257
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:16,769
You don't trust me?

258
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,396
You mean like you trust me?

259
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,358
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

260
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,486
There.

261
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:49,885
What are we looking for?

262
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:52,054
A USB port.

263
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,264
USB?

264
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:01,522
What?

265
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:09,155
"Thumb" drive.

266
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:11,574
Jesus.

267
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:16,704
It's encrypted.

268
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:21,417
Try this.

269
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:30,801
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

270
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:42,271
Oh, well, well, well.

271
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:44,940
So much for family values.

272
00:26:45,107 --> 00:26:46,275
Who is she?

273
00:26:46,358 --> 00:26:47,943
No idea.

274
00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:51,697
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

275
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:53,532
I know who he is.

276
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:54,992
What was that?

277
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:59,580
Shit, shit! The drive.

278
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:02,666
It sent out the photos from my account.

279
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,294
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

280
00:27:05,377 --> 00:27:07,463
Jesus.

281
00:27:07,546 --> 00:27:09,924
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

282
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,467
"He lies still."

283
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:12,718
About her?

284
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,554
Maybe.

285
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,598
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

286
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:21,102
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

287
00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:23,312
Never get in there without a warrant.

288
00:27:25,648 --> 00:27:26,732
Yeah.

289
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:41,038
Know who I am?

290
00:27:42,373 --> 00:27:44,625
Yeah. I got an idea.

291
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:46,502
I want to see the Penguin.

292
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:49,463
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

293
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:55,845
What's the problem?

294
00:27:55,928 --> 00:27:57,346
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

295
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,598
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

296
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:01,308
That's what I tried to tell him.

297
00:28:01,392 --> 00:28:03,686
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

298
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:05,646
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

299
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:08,107
Mine or yours?

300
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:17,408
Get him!

301
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:18,659
I saw that whole thing.

302
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:19,952
He's over there!

303
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,370
What is your problem?

304
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:06,207
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

305
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:18,219
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

306
00:29:18,344 --> 00:29:20,471
Take it easy, sweetheart.

307
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:22,348
You looking for me?

308
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:24,975
I see you met the twins.

309
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:29,230
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

310
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:31,607
I guess we both are.

311
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:35,069
How you doing?

312
00:29:35,694 --> 00:29:37,113
I'm Oz.

313
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,911
Who is she?

314
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:48,874
I really don't know, chief.

315
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,794
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

316
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:53,254
but I wasn't rolling with them.

317
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:07,685
It's okay, baby.

318
00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:12,022
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

319
00:30:37,757 --> 00:30:38,966
Thank you, honey.

320
00:30:45,473 --> 00:30:47,308
Here you go, champ.

321
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:50,936
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

322
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,813
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

323
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:54,690
Is that the mayor?

324
00:30:54,774 --> 00:30:56,567
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

325
00:30:57,777 --> 00:30:59,070
Don't make me hurt you.

326
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:03,324
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

327
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:06,368
Yeah, I do. Do you?

328
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,622
Look...

329
00:31:10,873 --> 00:31:13,667
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

330
00:31:14,502 --> 00:31:18,798
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

331
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:28,724
Tell you one thing.

332
00:31:30,893 --> 00:31:34,480
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

333
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,483
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

334
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:42,571
What? Too soon?

335
00:31:52,415 --> 00:31:54,792
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

336
00:32:04,093 --> 00:32:05,094
Taxi!

337
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:08,597
Taxi!

338
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:28,659
Hey, it's me.

339
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,287
Baby, what's wrong?

340
00:32:31,954 --> 00:32:33,956
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

341
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:37,835
On the news?

342
00:32:38,502 --> 00:32:41,797
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

343
00:32:41,881 --> 00:32:43,591
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

344
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,387
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

345
00:32:49,096 --> 00:32:51,724
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

346
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:53,809
Uh...

347
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,354
God damn it.

348
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,335
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

349
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:21,295
<i>with a younger mystery woman.</i>

350
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:24,215
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

351
00:33:57,665 --> 00:34:00,584
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

352
00:36:15,094 --> 00:36:16,429
You're pretty good at that.

353
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,171
Hey! Give me that.

354
00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:56,343
"Kosolov, Annika."

355
00:36:57,845 --> 00:36:59,930
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

356
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:02,767
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

357
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:43,474
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

358
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:46,018
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

359
00:37:46,102 --> 00:37:47,478
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

360
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:49,313
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

361
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:50,773
What does she know?

362
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:52,983
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

363
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:54,652
She did seem upset.

364
00:37:56,445 --> 00:37:57,947
Back at your place.

365
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,492
Let's go talk to her.

366
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:28,769
Anni!

367
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:31,147
Baby!

368
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:33,816
Anni!

369
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,113
Anni!

370
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:42,950
<i>It's gonna be cool this evening.</i>

371
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:45,244
<i>It's gonna be down into the 40s.</i>

372
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:47,204
<i>More breaking news this hour</i>

373
00:38:47,288 --> 00:38:52,668
<i>as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>

374
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:55,045
<i>And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...</i>

375
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,965
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

376
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:01,594
Shit, they took my phone.

377
00:39:01,677 --> 00:39:03,053
<i>His victim, longtime head

<i>inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.</i>

381
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:13,481
<i>The killer posted the following message
on social media,</i>

382
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:16,442
<i>and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>

383
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,241
<i>Hello, people of Gotham.</i>

384
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:26,285
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

385
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:29,413
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

386
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:34,293
<i>I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.</i>

387
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:36,420
<i>But I am not done.</i>

388
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,759
<i>Here is another...</i>

389
00:39:46,263 --> 00:39:49,058
<i>who will soon be losing face.</i>

390
00:39:50,392 --> 00:39:54,605
<i>I will kill again, and again, and again,</i>

391
00:39:54,688 --> 00:39:56,524
<i>until our day of judgment</i>

392
00:39:56,607 --> 00:40:01,612

393
00:40:02,405 --> 00:40:04,407

394
00:40:05,991 --> 00:40:07,743
<i>Goodbye!</i>

395
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:13,624
<i>Commissioner Savage

<i>30-year career on the GCPD...</i>

397
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:18,129
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

398
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:20,506
At the club.

399
00:40:22,174 --> 00:40:23,592
The Iceberg Lounge?

400
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:25,803
44 Below.

401
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:28,722
What is that?

402
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,519
The club within the club.

403
00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:36,522
The real club.

404
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:40,568
It's a mob hangout.

405
00:40:41,026 --> 00:40:42,445
Is that where you work?

406
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:45,197
Selina?

407
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:52,955
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

408
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:57,960
But I see 'em come in.

409
00:40:58,043 --> 00:40:59,253
Who?

410
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:02,256
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

411
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:06,510
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

412
00:41:08,763 --> 00:41:10,306
You're gonna help me on this.

413
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:12,433
For your friend.

414
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:24,361
You got a lot of cats.

415
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:27,782
I have a thing about strays.

416
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:33,245
You're not safe here.

417
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:35,539
I can take care of myself.

418
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:38,417
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

419
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:40,044
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

420
00:41:40,127 --> 00:41:43,380
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

421
00:41:43,464 --> 00:41:46,300
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

422
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:07,488
He waited for him at the gym.

423
00:42:08,614 --> 00:42:10,658
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

424
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:12,868
when no one else was around.

425
00:42:13,994 --> 00:42:15,413
There's a needle mark on his neck.

426
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,456
Injected him with arsenic.

427
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,793
Rat poison.

428
00:42:21,585 --> 00:42:23,170
Yeah.

429
00:42:23,337 --> 00:42:25,798
That seems to be his theme here.

430
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,716
Look at this thing.

431
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,601
It's a maze.

432
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:43,482
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

433
00:42:46,235 --> 00:42:47,319
More symbols.

434
00:42:49,822 --> 00:42:51,407
It's another cipher.

435
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,243
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

436
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,496
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

437
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,708
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

438
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:03,627
I don't get it.

439
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:06,088
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

440
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:09,008
Looks like he got greedy.

441
00:43:09,091 --> 00:43:10,134
You kidding me?

442
00:43:10,217 --> 00:43:12,928
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

443
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:16,265
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

444
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:18,559
Maybe he's not who you thought.

445
00:43:20,102 --> 00:43:22,146
You make it sound like he had it coming.

446
00:43:24,398 --> 00:43:25,858
He was a cop.

447
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:28,486
Crossed a line.

448
00:43:59,725 --> 00:44:01,393
"I'm mad about you.

449
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:05,147
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

450
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:15,366
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

451
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:19,120
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

452
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:20,913
The hell is that?

453
00:44:21,664 --> 00:44:24,834
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

454
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,461
I don't know.

455
00:44:28,337 --> 00:44:29,505
Lieutenant.

456
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:31,006
They're coming back.

457
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,341
We got to get out of here.

458
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:37,638
Come on.

459
00:44:42,726 --> 00:44:43,769
Ow!

460
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:46,564
I don't know about these things.

461
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:50,109
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

462
00:44:54,113 --> 00:44:56,699
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

463
00:44:58,576 --> 00:45:00,035
I'm just looking for Annika.

464
00:45:04,331 --> 00:45:05,958
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

465
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:09,712
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

466
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:20,473
Look at me.

467
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:32,276
Looks good. Here.

468
00:46:15,444 --> 00:46:17,446
I got you. Can you hear me?

469
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:19,407
Yeah.

470
00:46:28,082 --> 00:46:29,083
Hey, where you goin'?

471
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:30,835
Hospitality.

472
00:46:31,585 --> 00:46:34,422
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

473
00:46:36,215 --> 00:46:37,716
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

474
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,475
"Kenzie, William."

475
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:48,018
He's an off-duty cop.

476
00:46:49,895 --> 00:46:51,564
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

477
00:46:51,897 --> 00:46:53,941
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

478
00:47:10,499 --> 00:47:13,627
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

479
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:14,837
Great.

480
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:24,388
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

481
00:47:24,472 --> 00:47:26,056
Feels good, doesn't it?

482
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,350
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

483
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:36,025
<i>Jesus, I hate dropheads.</i>

484
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:37,151
Really?

485
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:38,194
'Cause when I first saw you,

486
00:47:38,277 --> 00:47:39,487
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

487
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,822
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

488
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:44,200
Can we not do this right now?

489
00:47:46,118 --> 00:47:47,661
Wait. Who was that?

490
00:47:47,745 --> 00:47:48,913
Oh, I saw him.

491
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:50,081
<i>Look back.</i>

492
00:47:50,164 --> 00:47:51,957
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

493
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:53,375
I need to see his face.

494
00:47:55,044 --> 00:47:56,504
Jesus.

495
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:05,679
That's the DA.

496
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:06,806
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

497
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:08,557
And he's coming over. You happy?

498
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:09,850
<i>Talk to him.</i>

499
00:48:12,978 --> 00:48:14,063
Hey. How you doing?

500
00:48:14,146 --> 00:48:15,231
Hi.

501
00:48:15,314 --> 00:48:16,148
I'm Gil.

502
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:18,984
Hey, aren't you the DA?

503
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:20,027
Yeah.

504
00:48:20,236 --> 00:48:22,405
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

505
00:48:22,488 --> 00:48:23,864
Is that right?

506
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:26,492
I haven't seen you around here before.

507
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:29,537
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

508
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,164
'cause people are all a little on edge.

509
00:48:32,248 --> 00:48:33,749
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

510
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:34,834
<i>Is that right?</i>

511
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:36,335
<i>I like that.</i>

512
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,753
Do you want to come over?

513
00:48:37,837 --> 00:48:38,963
Sure.

514
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:43,300
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

515
00:48:43,384 --> 00:48:44,802
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

516
00:48:45,094 --> 00:48:46,971
- <i>Richie, Glen.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

517
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:49,932
That's half the DA's office.

518
00:48:50,015 --> 00:48:51,183
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

519
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:52,226
Hi.

520
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:54,353
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

521
00:48:54,437 --> 00:48:56,313
Drowning our sorrows.

522
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:57,940
<i>You want a drop?</i>

523
00:48:58,023 --> 00:49:00,067
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

524
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:03,696
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

525
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:05,823
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

526
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:07,241
He's wasted.

527
00:49:07,324 --> 00:49:08,367
No shit.

528
00:49:10,035 --> 00:49:11,036
<i>I like this girl.</i>

529
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:13,080
Oh, hey, I like you too!

530
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:19,962
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

531
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:21,130
<i>He knows so much.</i>

532
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:22,506
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

533
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,842
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

534
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:25,843
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

535
00:49:25,926 --> 00:49:27,845
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

536
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:29,889
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

537
00:49:31,891 --> 00:49:33,726
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

538
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,279
<i>I mean...</i>

539
00:49:46,113 --> 00:49:49,700
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

540
00:49:50,284 --> 00:49:52,703
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

541
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:54,497
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

542
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,165
He's talking about the Maroni case.

543
00:49:56,248 --> 00:49:59,543
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

544
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,421
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

545
00:50:02,505 --> 00:50:04,423
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

546
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:07,134
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

547
00:50:07,218 --> 00:50:08,469
What do you know about that?

548
00:50:10,096 --> 00:50:11,263
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

549
00:50:11,347 --> 00:50:12,306
<i>I want a drink.</i>

550
00:50:12,473 --> 00:50:13,724
Keep him talking.

551
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:17,895
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

552
00:50:17,978 --> 00:50:19,021
She knows Annika.

553
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:20,523
No, stay on the DA.

554
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:22,525
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

555
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:26,779
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

556
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:27,905
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

557
00:50:27,988 --> 00:50:30,533
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

558
00:50:30,616 --> 00:50:31,867
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

559
00:50:31,951 --> 00:50:34,412
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

560
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:37,415
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

561
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:38,999
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

562
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,167
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

563
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:45,965
<i>Hey.</i>

564
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:47,633
Hey.

565
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:51,971
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

566
00:50:53,264 --> 00:50:54,473
How you been?

567
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:58,519
Yeah, I've been okay.

568
00:50:59,854 --> 00:51:01,230
<i>I was just...</i>

569
00:51:03,274 --> 00:51:05,109
I was just headed back upstairs.

570
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,861
Well...

571
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,613
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

572
00:51:23,711 --> 00:51:26,088
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

573
00:51:26,172 --> 00:51:27,757
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

574
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,633
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

575
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:31,552
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

576
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:32,720
Wait, what are you doing?

577
00:51:32,803 --> 00:51:35,222
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

578
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:40,811
Taxi!

579
00:51:44,774 --> 00:51:45,775
Hey!

580
00:51:47,485 --> 00:51:48,569
I lost you in there.

581
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:49,737
Yeah, I gotta go.

582
00:51:50,613 --> 00:51:52,031
Oh, you need a ride?

583
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,033
That's me right there.

584
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:01,207
Taxi!

585
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,416
I'm good.

586
00:52:04,126 --> 00:52:05,544
I hope, uh...

587
00:52:10,132 --> 00:52:11,550
I'll see you around.

588
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,016
Just hold still.

589
00:54:40,366 --> 00:54:41,283
What do you know about

590
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:43,661
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

591
00:54:46,747 --> 00:54:48,457
Yeah, sure, there was.

592
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:51,001
That's the rat we're looking for.

593
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:53,796
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

594
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,383
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

595
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:58,926
Where are you getting this?

596
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:01,887
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

597
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,140
Gil's very nervous.

598
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,643
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

599
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:09,603
I worked that case.

600
00:55:09,687 --> 00:55:11,647
Riddler's not after you.

601
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,648
How do you know?

602
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:14,442
You're not corrupt.

603
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:17,027
Colson's dirty?

604
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:24,410
Maybe I, uh...

605
00:55:25,077 --> 00:55:28,414
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

606
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:31,792
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

607
00:55:32,543 --> 00:55:34,336
Who knows how many people it touches.

608
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,631
Politicians. Police. The courts.

609
00:55:38,924 --> 00:55:40,634
It could tear the whole city apart.

610
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:43,095
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

611
00:55:44,722 --> 00:55:46,474
And Riddler's the match.

612
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:48,517
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

613
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:49,894
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

614
00:55:49,977 --> 00:55:51,395
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

615
00:55:51,479 --> 00:55:52,980
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

616
00:55:54,023 --> 00:55:55,608
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

617
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:57,359
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

618
00:55:58,486 --> 00:55:59,945
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

619
00:56:00,029 --> 00:56:01,072
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

620
00:56:01,155 --> 00:56:02,782
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

621
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:04,700
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

622
00:56:04,784 --> 00:56:06,035
Pretty.

623
00:56:08,037 --> 00:56:09,413
She a new friend of yours?

624
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:15,211
I'm not so sure.

625
00:56:16,045 --> 00:56:17,546
Looks like you upset her.

626
00:56:18,714 --> 00:56:20,841
Shall I take this as a good sign?

627
00:56:20,925 --> 00:56:21,926
What?

628
00:56:22,009 --> 00:56:22,927
Your attire.

629
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:25,137
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

630
00:56:25,221 --> 00:56:27,223
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

631
00:56:27,306 --> 00:56:29,975
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

632
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:32,603
Riddler might not be able to resist.

633
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:34,146
Oh, that reminds me.

634
00:56:35,314 --> 00:56:39,276
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

635
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:41,320
The one from the rat maze.

636
00:56:41,737 --> 00:56:44,824
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

637
00:56:45,157 --> 00:56:47,034
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

638
00:56:47,118 --> 00:56:50,371
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

639
00:56:50,996 --> 00:56:52,415
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

640
00:56:52,498 --> 00:56:53,707
"Rat with wings"?

641
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:56,293
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

642
00:56:56,377 --> 00:56:57,628
Yeah.

643
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:00,214
A stool pigeon.

644
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:02,091
Where are your cufflinks?

645
00:57:02,174 --> 00:57:03,134
I couldn't find them.

646
00:57:04,593 --> 00:57:06,554
Well, you can't go out like that.

647
00:57:06,637 --> 00:57:08,431
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

648
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:15,396
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

649
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:19,316
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

650
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:22,111
Your father gave them to me.

651
00:57:27,867 --> 00:57:30,995
No more lies! No more lies!

652
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,141
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

653
00:58:04,695 --> 00:58:06,447
Is that Bruce Wayne?

654
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,158
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

655
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,251
Hold it.

656
00:58:20,586 --> 00:58:21,837
You good, fellas?

657
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:23,422
Good.

658
00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:26,634
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

659
00:58:44,443 --> 00:58:45,444
Sir?

660
00:59:05,131 --> 00:59:06,090
Hey!

661
00:59:06,173 --> 00:59:08,175
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

662
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:10,970
Hey, watch it, fellas.

663
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:13,722
You got the prince of the city there.

664
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,394
Some event, huh?

665
00:59:18,477 --> 00:59:21,439
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

666
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:23,983
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

667
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:25,693
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

668
00:59:25,776 --> 00:59:27,778
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

669
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:30,072
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

670
00:59:30,698 --> 00:59:32,158
Wow. Is that right?

671
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:34,285
His father saved my life.

672
00:59:35,244 --> 00:59:38,456
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

673
00:59:39,665 --> 00:59:43,169
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

674
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:46,672
Operated right on the dining room table.

675
00:59:46,756 --> 00:59:52,011
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

676
00:59:53,429 --> 00:59:55,431
I remember your face.

677
00:59:57,433 --> 00:59:59,393
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

678
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:01,896
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

679
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:04,815
"Hippocratic oath."

680
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,569
That's good.

681
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:10,279
Excuse me.

682
01:00:13,866 --> 01:00:14,700
Yes.

683
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:29,965
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

684
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:31,634
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

685
01:00:31,717 --> 01:00:34,095
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

686
01:00:34,178 --> 01:00:35,971
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

687
01:00:36,055 --> 01:00:37,473
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

688
01:00:37,556 --> 01:00:38,974
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

689
01:00:39,058 --> 01:00:40,476
<i>consider a donation to</i>

690
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,603
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

691
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:44,939
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

692
01:00:45,022 --> 01:00:46,232
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

693
01:00:46,607 --> 01:00:49,151
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

694
01:00:50,236 --> 01:00:53,989
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

695
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:57,284
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

696
01:00:58,285 --> 01:01:00,162
He got what he deserved.

697
01:01:02,081 --> 01:01:03,082
Know what I mean?

698
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:06,502
Hey, don't I know you?

699
01:01:06,585 --> 01:01:07,670
Bruce Wayne.

700
01:01:08,587 --> 01:01:10,548
Why haven't you called me back?

701
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:11,632
I'm sorry?

702
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:14,260
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

703
01:01:14,343 --> 01:01:15,553
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

704
01:01:15,636 --> 01:01:18,305
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

705
01:01:18,389 --> 01:01:19,723
Will you walk with me?

706
01:01:24,895 --> 01:01:26,230
Mr. Wayne.

707
01:01:26,313 --> 01:01:27,523
Mr. Wayne.

708
01:01:28,232 --> 01:01:31,318
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

709
01:01:31,902 --> 01:01:33,738
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

710
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:36,240
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

711
01:01:36,323 --> 01:01:38,784
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

712
01:01:39,368 --> 01:01:40,661
Thank you.

713
01:01:41,537 --> 01:01:42,538
My God.

714
01:01:44,373 --> 01:01:46,876
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

715
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:48,586
I want to continue this.

716
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:53,674
Excuse me.

717
01:01:55,718 --> 01:01:57,595
I'm so sorry for your loss.

718
01:01:59,805 --> 01:02:00,723
Thank you.

719
01:02:00,806 --> 01:02:02,558
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

720
01:02:03,893 --> 01:02:05,770
Gil Colson is missing.

721
01:02:05,853 --> 01:02:07,146
What?

722
01:02:07,229 --> 01:02:09,523
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

723
01:02:09,607 --> 01:02:10,649
Christ, not again.

724
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:12,818
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

725
01:02:15,112 --> 01:02:17,156
You got people looking for him, Jim?

726
01:02:17,823 --> 01:02:20,117
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

727
01:02:20,201 --> 01:02:21,118
What'd his wife say?

728
01:02:21,202 --> 01:02:22,411
She hadn't heard from him.

729
01:03:17,174 --> 01:03:18,092
Get out of the car!

730
01:03:18,843 --> 01:03:21,053
Get out of the car and show your hands!

731
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:23,681
Get out!

732
01:03:34,191 --> 01:03:35,484
Get 'em up!

733
01:03:35,568 --> 01:03:37,319
Get out! Show 'em!

734
01:03:41,782 --> 01:03:43,367
Christ, it's Colson.

735
01:03:43,451 --> 01:03:45,161
There's a bomb around his neck!

736
01:04:00,217 --> 01:04:01,761
Let's clear this place out now!

737
01:04:01,844 --> 01:04:03,471
We've got to get this place cleared out!

738
01:04:37,713 --> 01:04:40,466
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

739
01:04:43,469 --> 01:04:44,887
We don't know if he's in on it.

740
01:04:48,015 --> 01:04:49,350
What's he looking at?

741
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:09,453
Holy shit.

742
01:05:10,496 --> 01:05:12,164
Are you kidding me?

743
01:05:12,248 --> 01:05:15,000
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

744
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:18,295
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

745
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:35,271
Please.

746
01:05:35,438 --> 01:05:38,190
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

747
01:05:38,607 --> 01:05:40,818
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

748
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:41,902
I'm so sorry.

749
01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:44,071
Looks like a combination lock.

750
01:05:44,155 --> 01:05:45,614
Can't we just cut it off?

751
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:48,033
Not if you want to keep your head.

752
01:06:24,737 --> 01:06:25,988
<i>You came.</i>

753
01:06:27,823 --> 01:06:28,908
Who are you?

754
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:30,451
<i>Me?</i>

755
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,455
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

756
01:06:35,915 --> 01:06:38,334
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

757
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:42,713
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

758
01:06:43,255 --> 01:06:44,340
"Unmask"?

759
01:06:44,423 --> 01:06:45,591
<i>Yes.</i>

760
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:49,261
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

761
01:06:49,345 --> 01:06:51,764
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

762
01:06:52,431 --> 01:06:54,767
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

763
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:56,644
How am I a part of this?

764
01:06:56,727 --> 01:06:58,646
<i>You'll see.</i>

765
01:06:58,729 --> 01:07:00,481
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

766
01:07:00,564 --> 01:07:02,650
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

767
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:03,984
<i>We're live.</i>

768
01:07:04,068 --> 01:07:07,071
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

769
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,448
<i>At the moment,</i>

770
01:07:09,532 --> 01:07:12,910
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

771
01:07:12,993 --> 01:07:14,036
<i>is dead.</i>

772
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,122
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

773
01:07:16,205 --> 01:07:17,164
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

774
01:07:17,248 --> 01:07:20,376
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

775
01:07:20,459 --> 01:07:23,462
<i>You hear me?</i>

776
01:07:23,546 --> 01:07:24,547
Okay.

777
01:07:33,305 --> 01:07:35,391
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

778
01:07:37,143 --> 01:07:39,311
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

779
01:07:41,355 --> 01:07:42,398
<i>Now,</i>

780
01:07:43,399 --> 01:07:46,193
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

781
01:07:46,277 --> 01:07:49,864
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

782
01:07:50,448 --> 01:07:52,867
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

783
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:56,287
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

784
01:07:56,370 --> 01:08:01,584
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

785
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:03,919
You want me to do puzzles?

786
01:08:04,003 --> 01:08:06,756
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

787
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:10,926
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

788
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:13,345
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

789
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:15,598
Okay, okay. So I just...

790
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:16,766
You want me to...

791
01:08:16,891 --> 01:08:19,226
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

792
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,938
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

793
01:08:23,022 --> 01:08:27,693
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

794
01:08:27,777 --> 01:08:30,196
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

795
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:31,363
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

796
01:08:31,447 --> 01:08:32,865
- "Justice."
- Huh?

797
01:08:32,948 --> 01:08:33,991
The answer's "justice."

798
01:08:34,075 --> 01:08:35,284
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

799
01:08:35,367 --> 01:08:36,952
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

800
01:08:37,036 --> 01:08:41,373
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

801
01:08:41,457 --> 01:08:43,834
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

802
01:08:43,918 --> 01:08:46,295
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

803
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:47,588
Of course, of course. Of course.

804
01:08:47,671 --> 01:08:50,049
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

805
01:08:50,132 --> 01:08:54,261
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

806
01:08:54,345 --> 01:08:58,516
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

807
01:08:58,599 --> 01:09:00,392
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

808
01:09:00,476 --> 01:09:01,727
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

809
01:09:01,811 --> 01:09:03,979
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

810
01:09:05,397 --> 01:09:06,524
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

811
01:09:06,607 --> 01:09:07,858
- How much?
- Nothing!

812
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:10,152
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

813
01:09:10,236 --> 01:09:12,530
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

814
01:09:12,613 --> 01:09:13,447
What cases?

815
01:09:13,531 --> 01:09:14,657
He didn't ask me that!

816
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:15,741
Come on! Ten grand.

817
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,161
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

818
01:09:19,245 --> 01:09:21,872
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

819
01:09:21,956 --> 01:09:25,793
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

820
01:09:25,876 --> 01:09:28,295
<i>Last riddle.</i>

821
01:09:28,379 --> 01:09:32,716
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

822
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:37,096
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

823
01:09:37,179 --> 01:09:39,265
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

824
01:09:39,348 --> 01:09:41,892
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

825
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:43,769
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

826
01:09:43,853 --> 01:09:45,062
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

827
01:09:45,146 --> 01:09:46,814
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

828
01:09:46,897 --> 01:09:48,858
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

829
01:09:48,941 --> 01:09:50,484
If I go out this way, it's just me.

830
01:09:50,568 --> 01:09:53,696
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

831
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:55,239
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

832
01:09:55,322 --> 01:09:56,657
- People are watching.
- What people?

833
01:09:56,741 --> 01:09:58,868
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

834
01:09:58,951 --> 01:10:01,120
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

835
01:10:01,203 --> 01:10:02,079
<i>Four!</i>

836
01:10:02,163 --> 01:10:03,539
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

837
01:10:03,622 --> 01:10:05,499
<i>Goodbye!</i>

838
01:10:35,696 --> 01:10:37,073
Who do you think he is under there?

839
01:10:37,156 --> 01:10:37,990
Take it easy.

840
01:10:38,074 --> 01:10:39,075
I want to see.

841
01:10:40,409 --> 01:10:41,619
What is that thing? Leather?

842
01:10:45,372 --> 01:10:46,832
What's he got on his eyes?

843
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:48,375
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

844
01:10:48,459 --> 01:10:49,668
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

845
01:10:49,752 --> 01:10:50,920
Hey!

846
01:10:51,504 --> 01:10:54,632
Hey! Hey! Hey!

847
01:10:54,715 --> 01:10:56,383
Relax, God damn it!

848
01:10:56,467 --> 01:10:57,968
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

849
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:01,931
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

850
01:11:02,014 --> 01:11:04,433
Colson's blood is on his hands.

851
01:11:04,517 --> 01:11:05,935
Maybe it's on yours.

852
01:11:07,394 --> 01:11:08,437
What'd you say?

853
01:11:08,521 --> 01:11:10,106
He would rather die than talk.

854
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:12,191
What was he afraid of?

855
01:11:12,942 --> 01:11:14,026
You?

856
01:11:21,158 --> 01:11:22,576
You son of a bitch.

857
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,163
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

858
01:11:26,247 --> 01:11:27,957
You could be an accessory to murder.

859
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,041
Why are we playing games...

860
01:11:31,168 --> 01:11:32,044
Get him! Come on!

861
01:11:32,128 --> 01:11:34,130
Back off! Back off!

862
01:11:34,213 --> 01:11:36,507
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

863
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:38,676
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

864
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:41,554
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

865
01:11:44,223 --> 01:11:45,766
You too now?

866
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:48,394
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

867
01:11:48,477 --> 01:11:51,063
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

868
01:11:51,147 --> 01:11:53,399
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

869
01:11:56,193 --> 01:11:57,695
Okay, give him the room.

870
01:12:13,335 --> 01:12:14,628
Two minutes.

871
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:27,975
You listen to me.

872
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,562
We gotta get you out of here.

873
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:35,191
That would put a lot of heat on you.

874
01:12:35,274 --> 01:12:36,942
Well, you punched me in the face.

875
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:40,488
Take this key.

876
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:45,159
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

877
01:12:46,202 --> 01:12:47,912
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

878
01:12:48,913 --> 01:12:51,207
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

879
01:12:54,585 --> 01:12:56,962
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

880
01:13:00,382 --> 01:13:03,094
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

881
01:13:03,177 --> 01:13:06,097
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

882
01:13:07,014 --> 01:13:09,642
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

883
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,313
Or he moonlights as a cop.

884
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:20,403
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

885
01:13:20,486 --> 01:13:21,987
Somebody stop him!

886
01:14:00,192 --> 01:14:01,736
- There he is!
- Freeze!

887
01:14:48,115 --> 01:14:50,034
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

888
01:14:50,576 --> 01:14:51,786
I did.

889
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:55,247
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

890
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:57,374
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

891
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:58,584
I only trust you.

892
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:01,003
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

893
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:04,465
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

894
01:15:05,216 --> 01:15:06,342
You think Penguin's the rat?

895
01:15:06,425 --> 01:15:09,470
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

896
01:15:09,553 --> 01:15:11,514
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

897
01:15:11,597 --> 01:15:12,932
DA was a regular too.

898
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:16,519
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

899
01:15:17,603 --> 01:15:18,813
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

900
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:19,855
The what?

901
01:15:19,939 --> 01:15:21,398
Riddler's latest.

902
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:23,192
The cipher in the maze.

903
01:15:23,275 --> 01:15:25,778
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

904
01:15:27,363 --> 01:15:28,989
A penguin's got wings too.

905
01:15:30,991 --> 01:15:32,952
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

906
01:15:33,035 --> 01:15:34,703
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

907
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:37,998
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

908
01:15:38,082 --> 01:15:41,252
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

909
01:15:43,879 --> 01:15:45,714
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

910
01:15:46,882 --> 01:15:47,967
There's Penguin.

911
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,927
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

912
01:15:51,554 --> 01:15:52,805
<i>You want to move in?</i>

913
01:15:54,682 --> 01:15:56,142
<i>Let's follow.</i>

914
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:18,205
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

915
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,582
<i>I'm here.</i>

916
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,668
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

917
01:16:22,752 --> 01:16:25,254
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

918
01:16:44,482 --> 01:16:47,026
It's a drug lab. Drops.

919
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:48,319
This is a buy.

920
01:16:48,402 --> 01:16:51,572
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

921
01:16:51,655 --> 01:16:52,823
Or they never shut it down at all.

922
01:16:52,907 --> 01:16:53,783
<i>What are you saying?</i>

923
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:56,994
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

924
01:17:21,352 --> 01:17:22,770
This just got complicated.

925
01:17:23,521 --> 01:17:24,688
What do you mean?

926
01:17:30,611 --> 01:17:32,071
Hey! What happened?

927
01:17:32,154 --> 01:17:33,489
You all right?

928
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:46,001
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

929
01:17:46,127 --> 01:17:47,753
Jesus.

930
01:17:48,504 --> 01:17:50,339
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

931
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,174
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

932
01:17:52,258 --> 01:17:53,968
Is that why you work in the club?

933
01:17:54,718 --> 01:17:55,761
It was all just a score?

934
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:59,640
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

935
01:18:01,016 --> 01:18:02,935
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

936
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:15,197
Jesus!

937
01:18:43,809 --> 01:18:44,935
Hey, Vengeance!

938
01:18:47,104 --> 01:18:49,815
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

939
01:19:30,689 --> 01:19:32,316
Kenzie! Get the money!

940
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:38,989
Hey! What the...

941
01:20:29,623 --> 01:20:30,958
Whoa!

942
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:35,755
Come on! Come on!

943
01:20:38,924 --> 01:20:40,259
This guy's crazy!

944
01:20:42,011 --> 01:20:43,721
Come on! Hey!

945
01:21:33,187 --> 01:21:34,188
Move!

946
01:22:39,003 --> 01:22:40,880
Get out of the way!

947
01:22:52,016 --> 01:22:53,100
Come on!

948
01:23:01,817 --> 01:23:02,943
Get out of the way!

949
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:42,233
I got you!

950
01:23:43,484 --> 01:23:44,819
I got you!

951
01:23:44,902 --> 01:23:47,238
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

952
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:48,781
I got you!

953
01:25:05,232 --> 01:25:08,069
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

954
01:25:08,152 --> 01:25:10,780
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

955
01:25:10,863 --> 01:25:12,156
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

956
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:13,657
Cops caught you doing something.

957
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:15,367
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

958
01:25:15,451 --> 01:25:17,328
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

959
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:19,538
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

960
01:25:19,622 --> 01:25:20,831
His drops operation.

961
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,375
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

962
01:25:23,459 --> 01:25:27,088
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

963
01:25:27,171 --> 01:25:28,923
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

964
01:25:29,006 --> 01:25:31,342
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

965
01:25:31,425 --> 01:25:34,637
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

966
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,888
What are you, crazy?

967
01:25:35,971 --> 01:25:37,056
That why you killed the girl?

968
01:25:37,139 --> 01:25:38,099
I didn't kill no girl!

969
01:25:38,182 --> 01:25:39,975
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

970
01:25:40,059 --> 01:25:41,352
But she got too close, right?

971
01:25:41,435 --> 01:25:43,646
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

972
01:25:43,729 --> 01:25:45,689
But somehow Riddler found out too.

973
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:47,691
He knows so much about you.

974
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,819
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

975
01:25:50,403 --> 01:25:52,613
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

976
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:54,198
Why don't you start harmonizing?

977
01:25:54,532 --> 01:25:57,201
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

978
01:25:57,284 --> 01:25:58,619
I ain't no rat!

979
01:25:58,702 --> 01:26:00,538
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

980
01:26:00,621 --> 01:26:01,705
if he heard this kind of talk?

981
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,958
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

982
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:06,585
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

983
01:26:06,669 --> 01:26:08,212
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

984
01:26:08,295 --> 01:26:09,922
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

985
01:26:10,005 --> 01:26:11,924
Open your eyes!

986
01:26:15,845 --> 01:26:17,430
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

987
01:26:17,513 --> 01:26:19,014
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

988
01:26:19,098 --> 01:26:20,933
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

989
01:26:21,016 --> 01:26:23,352
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

990
01:26:23,436 --> 01:26:26,021
It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

991
01:26:26,105 --> 01:26:27,481
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

992
01:26:27,565 --> 01:26:28,774
Why, you got something to tell us?

993
01:26:28,858 --> 01:26:29,734
Yeah!

994
01:26:30,401 --> 01:26:31,444
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

995
01:26:31,527 --> 01:26:32,361
What?

996
01:26:32,778 --> 01:26:34,113
It's <i>"La."</i>

997
01:26:34,196 --> 01:26:35,489
<i>"La" rata.</i>

998
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,992
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

999
01:26:38,075 --> 01:26:39,952
Jesus! Look at you two.

1000
01:26:40,369 --> 01:26:42,621
World's greatest detectives!

1001
01:26:43,038 --> 01:26:45,332
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

1002
01:26:45,416 --> 01:26:46,500
Jesus!

1003
01:26:46,584 --> 01:26:48,085
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

1004
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:50,171
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1005
01:26:51,589 --> 01:26:52,673
You think he made a mistake?

1006
01:26:52,757 --> 01:26:53,966
He doesn't make mistakes.

1007
01:26:54,049 --> 01:26:55,092
A rat with wings?

1008
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:56,761
You know what that sounds like to me?

1009
01:26:56,844 --> 01:27:00,014
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1010
01:27:00,097 --> 01:27:02,099
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

1011
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:11,609
"You are <i>el."</i>

1012
01:27:20,284 --> 01:27:21,786
Maybe it was a mistake.

1013
01:27:22,203 --> 01:27:23,037
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1014
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:23,954
Wait.

1015
01:27:27,374 --> 01:27:28,709
Is that him?

1016
01:27:29,585 --> 01:27:31,420
Holy shit.

1017
01:27:51,315 --> 01:27:52,900
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1018
01:28:22,304 --> 01:28:25,933
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

1019
01:28:26,016 --> 01:28:28,853
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1020
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:30,855
I'll never know where I come from.

1021
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:33,065
Do you know what I am?"

1022
01:28:33,149 --> 01:28:34,150
Any idea?

1023
01:28:34,692 --> 01:28:35,693
Yeah.

1024
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:38,362
It's an orphan.

1025
01:28:47,246 --> 01:28:48,998
A mansion in a slum.

1026
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:53,127
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

1027
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,920
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1028
01:28:55,546 --> 01:28:57,131
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1029
01:28:57,214 --> 01:28:58,048
Let's go.

1030
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:03,763
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1031
01:29:04,805 --> 01:29:06,182
You gonna untie me?

1032
01:29:06,265 --> 01:29:07,725
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

1033
01:29:11,645 --> 01:29:12,646
Hey!

1034
01:29:14,106 --> 01:29:16,525
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1035
01:29:30,623 --> 01:29:32,792
No guns.

1036
01:29:34,251 --> 01:29:36,295
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1037
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,609
What's that?

1038
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,038
Hey! Hey!

1039
01:30:17,503 --> 01:30:18,712
Dropheads.

1040
01:30:26,137 --> 01:30:27,763
What the hell is that?

1041
01:30:39,525 --> 01:30:41,902
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

1042
01:30:41,986 --> 01:30:43,279
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

1043
01:30:46,031 --> 01:30:48,075
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

1044
01:30:48,492 --> 01:30:50,077
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1045
01:30:51,829 --> 01:30:53,414
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1046
01:30:54,707 --> 01:30:56,500
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

1047
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:01,172
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

1048
01:31:01,714 --> 01:31:03,507
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1049
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:06,427
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

1050
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,847
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

1051
01:31:10,389 --> 01:31:12,266
<i>Win or lose,</i>

1052
01:31:12,349 --> 01:31:15,144
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

1053
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,439
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

1054
01:31:19,023 --> 01:31:23,069
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

1055
01:31:23,152 --> 01:31:25,071
<i>who need it now,</i>

1056
01:31:25,154 --> 01:31:26,614
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

1057
01:31:26,697 --> 01:31:28,115
"Sins of the father."

1058
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:30,659
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

1059
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,206
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

1060
01:31:39,085 --> 01:31:41,295
Shall be visited upon the son.

1061
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:46,425
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1062
01:31:51,013 --> 01:31:52,431
Hey!

1063
01:32:52,116 --> 01:32:54,660
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

1064
01:32:54,744 --> 01:32:56,579
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

1065
01:32:56,662 --> 01:32:58,289
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1066
01:32:58,956 --> 01:33:01,041
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1067
01:33:12,845 --> 01:33:14,597
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1068
01:33:15,765 --> 01:33:17,433
I'm so sorry.

1069
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:20,644
I've been trying to reach you.

1070
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:25,065
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

1071
01:33:25,608 --> 01:33:29,361
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1072
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:53,719
We've sedated him.

1073
01:33:53,803 --> 01:33:55,429
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1074
01:33:56,305 --> 01:33:59,016
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1075
01:33:59,558 --> 01:34:01,310
Is there anyone else to notify?

1076
01:34:02,645 --> 01:34:04,063
Next of kin?

1077
01:34:09,193 --> 01:34:10,277
No.

1078
01:34:11,404 --> 01:34:13,030
It's just me.

1079
01:35:56,133 --> 01:35:57,384
Selina?

1080
01:36:04,016 --> 01:36:05,017
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1081
01:36:08,145 --> 01:36:10,564
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

1082
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,525
<i>Where can we go?</i>

1083
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:33,129
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1084
01:36:34,213 --> 01:36:36,674
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1085
01:36:36,757 --> 01:36:39,218
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1086
01:36:39,885 --> 01:36:41,637
How could they do that to her?

1087
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,681
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1088
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:45,683
Her body was in his car.

1089
01:36:45,766 --> 01:36:48,644
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1090
01:36:48,727 --> 01:36:51,730
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1091
01:36:51,814 --> 01:36:53,357
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1092
01:36:53,441 --> 01:36:55,067
She didn't know any better.

1093
01:36:55,151 --> 01:36:56,485
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1094
01:36:56,569 --> 01:36:58,112
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1095
01:36:58,195 --> 01:36:59,697
It means your choices have consequences.

1096
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,158
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1097
01:37:02,241 --> 01:37:04,952
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1098
01:37:05,035 --> 01:37:06,871
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1099
01:37:07,204 --> 01:37:09,373
Compromising yourself for money?

1100
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:13,002
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1101
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:18,299
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1102
01:37:18,382 --> 01:37:19,717
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1103
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,135
Falcone owes me that money.

1104
01:37:21,218 --> 01:37:22,970
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1105
01:37:23,053 --> 01:37:23,888
Oh, really? Why's that?

1106
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:24,889
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1107
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:26,724
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1108
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:27,808
would owe you anything.

1109
01:37:27,892 --> 01:37:30,227
Because he's my father!

1110
01:37:39,361 --> 01:37:42,156
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1111
01:37:43,657 --> 01:37:44,950
Just like Anni.

1112
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,663
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1113
01:37:51,749 --> 01:37:53,084
To the club?

1114
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:55,002
Yeah.

1115
01:37:57,713 --> 01:38:00,591
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1116
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,802
Used to see him there.

1117
01:38:03,552 --> 01:38:05,554
He scared the shit out of me.

1118
01:38:07,515 --> 01:38:10,976
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1119
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:15,356
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1120
01:38:18,734 --> 01:38:21,070
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1121
01:38:21,737 --> 01:38:23,239
Strangled.

1122
01:38:23,656 --> 01:38:27,118
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1123
01:38:28,994 --> 01:38:31,080
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1124
01:38:31,163 --> 01:38:33,332
and he didn't say a thing.

1125
01:38:35,167 --> 01:38:36,961
Couldn't even look at me.

1126
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:42,466
He owes me that money.

1127
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:45,678
I'm sorry.

1128
01:38:46,804 --> 01:38:47,972
For what I said.

1129
01:38:49,348 --> 01:38:50,766
Oh, it's all right.

1130
01:38:54,311 --> 01:38:56,397
You assume the worst in people.

1131
01:38:57,314 --> 01:38:58,691
Which, well...

1132
01:39:00,985 --> 01:39:02,903
maybe we're not so different after all.

1133
01:39:08,367 --> 01:39:10,119
Who are you under there?

1134
01:39:16,208 --> 01:39:18,085
What are you hiding?

1135
01:39:20,463 --> 01:39:22,298
Are you just...

1136
01:39:23,883 --> 01:39:25,593
hideously scarred?

1137
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,721
Yeah.

1138
01:39:35,978 --> 01:39:37,396
Listen to me.

1139
01:39:38,939 --> 01:39:41,817
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1140
01:39:42,985 --> 01:39:47,656
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1141
01:39:48,282 --> 01:39:51,368
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1142
01:39:51,452 --> 01:39:52,703
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1143
01:39:52,787 --> 01:39:54,038
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1144
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:56,165
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1145
01:39:56,248 --> 01:39:57,500
I think you'd be on his side.

1146
01:39:57,583 --> 01:39:59,210
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1147
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:01,253
What, do you live in a cave?

1148
01:40:01,337 --> 01:40:03,422
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1149
01:40:04,507 --> 01:40:08,385
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1150
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:09,678
will you help me?

1151
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:12,223
Please.

1152
01:40:15,017 --> 01:40:16,936
Come on, Vengeance.

1153
01:40:19,396 --> 01:40:21,649
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1154
01:40:21,732 --> 01:40:23,359
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1155
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:34,453
I told you, baby.

1156
01:40:36,372 --> 01:40:38,958
I can take care of myself.

1157
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,055
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

1158
01:41:00,896 --> 01:41:04,483
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

1159
01:41:04,608 --> 01:41:06,444
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

1160
01:41:06,652 --> 01:41:09,071
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

1161
01:41:09,238 --> 01:41:10,698
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1162
01:41:11,407 --> 01:41:13,743
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

1163
01:41:14,952 --> 01:41:17,288
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1164
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:19,832
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1165
01:41:19,915 --> 01:41:23,085
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

1166
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:29,091
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

1167
01:41:29,175 --> 01:41:32,845
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1168
01:41:33,554 --> 01:41:35,097
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

1169
01:41:35,181 --> 01:41:37,683
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

1170
01:41:37,767 --> 01:41:39,393
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1171
01:41:39,477 --> 01:41:45,065
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

1172
01:41:45,149 --> 01:41:49,820
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

1173
01:41:49,904 --> 01:41:52,281
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1174
01:41:53,115 --> 01:41:55,618
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

1175
01:41:55,701 --> 01:41:59,622
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

1176
01:41:59,747 --> 01:42:01,791
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

1177
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:06,587
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

1178
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:09,256
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1179
01:42:09,381 --> 01:42:12,426
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

1180
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:18,265
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1181
01:42:18,766 --> 01:42:21,143
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

1182
01:42:21,227 --> 01:42:23,604
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1183
01:42:23,687 --> 01:42:27,149
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

1184
01:42:27,233 --> 01:42:30,027
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

1185
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:33,406
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1186
01:42:39,161 --> 01:42:40,246
Do you know who I am?

1187
01:42:41,872 --> 01:42:42,998
You're Bruce Wayne.

1188
01:42:43,082 --> 01:42:44,959
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1189
01:42:55,719 --> 01:42:56,720
See?

1190
01:43:08,023 --> 01:43:10,651
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1191
01:43:11,402 --> 01:43:13,529
Must have made a fortune.

1192
01:43:13,988 --> 01:43:15,740
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1193
01:43:17,241 --> 01:43:19,702
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1194
01:43:19,785 --> 01:43:20,786
No, boss.

1195
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:23,205
$1,183.

1196
01:43:23,789 --> 01:43:25,750
You know why communism failed, right?

1197
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:26,834
No, boss.

1198
01:43:28,753 --> 01:43:30,004
Austerity.

1199
01:43:32,256 --> 01:43:33,883
All right. All right.

1200
01:43:34,175 --> 01:43:36,552
Look at that. Perfect.

1201
01:43:36,635 --> 01:43:38,387
It's never gonna be that good again.

1202
01:43:40,598 --> 01:43:43,100
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1203
01:43:43,184 --> 01:43:44,351
What are you doing here?

1204
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:48,105
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1205
01:43:49,023 --> 01:43:50,065
Come on.

1206
01:43:51,984 --> 01:43:53,194
See ya, champ.

1207
01:43:54,195 --> 01:43:55,446
Come on, sweetheart.

1208
01:43:57,406 --> 01:43:58,407
Have a seat.

1209
01:44:00,451 --> 01:44:02,244
I thought I might hear from you.

1210
01:44:03,412 --> 01:44:06,540
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1211
01:44:08,084 --> 01:44:09,877
stirring things up, huh?

1212
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,670
- Is it true?
- What?

1213
01:44:12,963 --> 01:44:14,590
That reporter business?

1214
01:44:15,925 --> 01:44:17,134
What do you want to know here, kid?

1215
01:44:17,218 --> 01:44:20,012
Did you kill him? For my father?

1216
01:44:20,096 --> 01:44:22,848
Look, your father was in trouble.

1217
01:44:23,724 --> 01:44:25,518
This reporter had some dirt.

1218
01:44:25,601 --> 01:44:27,228
Some very...

1219
01:44:28,395 --> 01:44:32,149
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1220
01:44:32,233 --> 01:44:34,944
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1221
01:44:35,027 --> 01:44:36,487
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1222
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:38,489
not right before the election.

1223
01:44:38,948 --> 01:44:41,242
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

1224
01:44:41,325 --> 01:44:42,952
but he wasn't going for it.

1225
01:44:43,035 --> 01:44:46,205
So, he came to me.

1226
01:44:46,288 --> 01:44:48,666
Well, I never seen him like that.

1227
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,335
He said, "Carmine,

1228
01:44:52,128 --> 01:44:56,841
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1229
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:02,179
And when fear isn't enough...

1230
01:45:02,847 --> 01:45:04,682
Oof. Hmm.

1231
01:45:06,016 --> 01:45:09,353
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1232
01:45:10,354 --> 01:45:12,189
I handled it.

1233
01:45:13,899 --> 01:45:15,317
I know.

1234
01:45:15,401 --> 01:45:17,653
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1235
01:45:18,904 --> 01:45:20,740
But you'd be surprised

1236
01:45:20,823 --> 01:45:23,200
what even a good man like him

1237
01:45:23,284 --> 01:45:25,870
is capable of in the right situation.

1238
01:45:28,122 --> 01:45:29,582
Do me a favor.

1239
01:45:29,915 --> 01:45:31,959
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1240
01:45:32,668 --> 01:45:34,253
This reporter

1241
01:45:35,087 --> 01:45:36,672
was a lowlife.

1242
01:45:36,756 --> 01:45:38,215
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1243
01:45:39,842 --> 01:45:41,469
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1244
01:45:42,219 --> 01:45:45,473
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1245
01:45:46,891 --> 01:45:50,394
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1246
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:52,813
that your father would be in my pocket,

1247
01:45:53,564 --> 01:45:54,565
forever.

1248
01:45:55,232 --> 01:45:57,276
He would have done anything

1249
01:45:57,359 --> 01:45:59,528
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1250
01:45:59,612 --> 01:46:00,946
You understand?

1251
01:46:02,156 --> 01:46:06,702
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1252
01:46:06,786 --> 01:46:08,829
Do I know it for a fact?

1253
01:46:11,248 --> 01:46:13,334
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1254
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:17,004
This is what you wanted, huh?

1255
01:46:17,088 --> 01:46:19,507
This little conversation here?

1256
01:46:21,926 --> 01:46:24,095
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1257
01:46:26,722 --> 01:46:28,849
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1258
01:47:38,252 --> 01:47:39,545
You lied to me...

1259
01:47:42,381 --> 01:47:44,008
my whole life.

1260
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:51,223
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1261
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:57,605
He told me what he did for my father.

1262
01:48:01,609 --> 01:48:03,110
About Salvatore Maroni.

1263
01:48:05,112 --> 01:48:07,823
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1264
01:48:07,907 --> 01:48:09,658
Had my father killed.

1265
01:48:12,119 --> 01:48:14,330
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1266
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:21,629
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1267
01:48:21,712 --> 01:48:24,048
believing that he was a good man.

1268
01:48:24,131 --> 01:48:25,716
He was a good man.

1269
01:48:26,884 --> 01:48:28,594
You listen to me.

1270
01:48:28,677 --> 01:48:32,098
Your father was a good man.

1271
01:48:35,726 --> 01:48:37,645
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1272
01:48:37,728 --> 01:48:39,647
He had a man killed.

1273
01:48:39,730 --> 01:48:40,815
Why?

1274
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:45,236
To protect his family image?

1275
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,571
His political aspirations?

1276
01:48:47,655 --> 01:48:51,200
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1277
01:48:53,786 --> 01:48:55,329
He was protecting your mother.

1278
01:48:56,288 --> 01:48:59,834
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1279
01:48:59,917 --> 01:49:02,044
He cared about her,

1280
01:49:02,128 --> 01:49:03,421
and you,

1281
01:49:03,504 --> 01:49:06,424
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1282
01:49:06,507 --> 01:49:09,969
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1283
01:49:10,845 --> 01:49:14,181
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1284
01:49:14,265 --> 01:49:17,393
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1285
01:49:17,476 --> 01:49:19,311
That's who Falcone is.

1286
01:49:21,564 --> 01:49:23,774
And that was your father's mistake.

1287
01:49:23,858 --> 01:49:25,901
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1288
01:49:25,985 --> 01:49:28,738
your father was distraught.

1289
01:49:29,613 --> 01:49:32,825
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1290
01:49:32,908 --> 01:49:35,077
that he would confess everything.

1291
01:49:36,579 --> 01:49:38,581
And that night,

1292
01:49:38,664 --> 01:49:42,585
your father and your mother were killed.

1293
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:49,842
It was Falcone?

1294
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:58,017
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1295
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:06,275
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1296
01:50:06,358 --> 01:50:09,111
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1297
01:50:09,195 --> 01:50:14,408
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1298
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:20,039
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1299
01:50:20,706 --> 01:50:22,500
I know you always blamed yourself.

1300
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:25,127
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1301
01:50:27,296 --> 01:50:29,590
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1302
01:50:31,008 --> 01:50:33,385
but I didn't know how to help.

1303
01:50:33,469 --> 01:50:35,971
I could teach you how to fight,

1304
01:50:37,348 --> 01:50:40,017
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1305
01:50:40,101 --> 01:50:41,936
You needed a father.

1306
01:50:43,896 --> 01:50:46,315
And all you had was me.

1307
01:50:48,692 --> 01:50:49,902
I'm sorry.

1308
01:50:51,654 --> 01:50:53,572
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1309
01:51:00,371 --> 01:51:01,455
God.

1310
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:08,921
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1311
01:51:11,632 --> 01:51:13,759
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1312
01:51:20,182 --> 01:51:21,434
I mean,

1313
01:51:22,643 --> 01:51:24,770
I'm not afraid to die.

1314
01:51:26,522 --> 01:51:28,899
I realize now there's something

1315
01:51:30,025 --> 01:51:31,902
I haven't got past.

1316
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,572
This fear...

1317
01:51:37,032 --> 01:51:39,994
of ever going through any of that again.

1318
01:51:44,248 --> 01:51:46,459
Of losing somebody I care about.

1319
01:52:37,051 --> 01:52:38,010
Hey.

1320
01:52:38,094 --> 01:52:40,846
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1321
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:42,848
I thought it was you.

1322
01:52:55,778 --> 01:52:57,321
- I found him!
- I see that.

1323
01:52:57,405 --> 01:52:58,906
He had my shit and my phone.

1324
01:52:58,989 --> 01:53:00,199
She left a message
the night they took her.

1325
01:53:00,282 --> 01:53:01,200
She called me...

1326
01:53:01,283 --> 01:53:02,993
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1327
01:53:03,077 --> 01:53:04,370
She got my gun!

1328
01:53:05,704 --> 01:53:07,415
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1329
01:53:08,958 --> 01:53:11,502
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1330
01:53:16,090 --> 01:53:18,175
Here. Listen.

1331
01:53:20,136 --> 01:53:21,804
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1332
01:53:21,929 --> 01:53:24,098
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1333
01:53:24,181 --> 01:53:26,267
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1334
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:27,685
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1335
01:53:27,768 --> 01:53:29,478
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1336
01:53:29,562 --> 01:53:30,604
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1337
01:53:30,688 --> 01:53:31,981
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1338
01:53:32,064 --> 01:53:34,734
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1339
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:38,654
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1340
01:53:39,363 --> 01:53:41,907
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1341
01:53:41,991 --> 01:53:44,910
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1342
01:53:44,994 --> 01:53:47,705
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1343
01:53:48,247 --> 01:53:50,249
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1344
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:53,836
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1345
01:53:53,919 --> 01:53:56,630
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1346
01:53:56,714 --> 01:53:58,841
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1347
01:53:58,924 --> 01:54:02,052
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1348
01:54:02,887 --> 01:54:05,431
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1349
01:54:06,515 --> 01:54:07,850
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1350
01:54:08,642 --> 01:54:12,188
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1351
01:54:12,688 --> 01:54:13,898
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1352
01:54:13,981 --> 01:54:15,941
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1353
01:54:16,025 --> 01:54:17,318
<i>The deal.</i>

1354
01:54:17,401 --> 01:54:22,323
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1355
01:54:22,406 --> 01:54:25,117
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1356
01:54:25,201 --> 01:54:27,578
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1357
01:54:27,661 --> 01:54:28,788
<i>Right.</i>

1358
01:54:29,538 --> 01:54:30,915
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1359
01:54:31,874 --> 01:54:34,043
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1360
01:54:41,717 --> 01:54:43,052
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

1361
01:54:43,135 --> 01:54:44,678
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1362
01:54:44,762 --> 01:54:47,807
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1363
01:54:57,024 --> 01:54:58,317
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1364
01:55:03,072 --> 01:55:04,865
A falcon has wings too.

1365
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:07,034
Falcone is the rat?

1366
01:55:18,003 --> 01:55:21,173
Falcone works for you guys?

1367
01:55:21,841 --> 01:55:24,385
The mayor? The DA?

1368
01:55:27,388 --> 01:55:28,472
No.

1369
01:55:31,559 --> 01:55:32,852
We work for him.

1370
01:55:33,853 --> 01:55:35,104
Everybody does.

1371
01:55:35,187 --> 01:55:36,188
How?

1372
01:55:36,272 --> 01:55:37,857
Through Renewal.

1373
01:55:38,649 --> 01:55:40,025
Renewal is everything.

1374
01:55:40,109 --> 01:55:41,444
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1375
01:55:42,027 --> 01:55:45,740
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1376
01:55:45,823 --> 01:55:49,410
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1377
01:55:49,493 --> 01:55:52,872
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1378
01:55:52,955 --> 01:55:55,040
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1379
01:55:55,124 --> 01:55:56,834
Everybody got a piece.

1380
01:55:56,917 --> 01:55:58,753
But Falcone wanted more.

1381
01:56:00,546 --> 01:56:03,758
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1382
01:56:05,176 --> 01:56:07,511
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1383
01:56:07,887 --> 01:56:10,598
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1384
01:56:10,681 --> 01:56:13,142
then install them all as his puppets.

1385
01:56:13,225 --> 01:56:15,770
You think this goddamn election matters?

1386
01:56:17,396 --> 01:56:19,315
Falcone's the mayor.

1387
01:56:20,274 --> 01:56:22,777
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1388
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:24,236
Come on, Vengeance.

1389
01:56:24,945 --> 01:56:26,781
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1390
01:56:27,490 --> 01:56:29,116
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1391
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:30,034
No!

1392
01:56:31,494 --> 01:56:32,703
We'll get him.

1393
01:56:33,370 --> 01:56:35,247
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1394
01:56:35,331 --> 01:56:36,457
He owns the city!

1395
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,792
Cross that line...

1396
01:56:38,584 --> 01:56:39,877
you'll become just like him.

1397
01:56:40,586 --> 01:56:42,129
Listen to me.

1398
01:56:42,213 --> 01:56:44,090
Don't throw your life away.

1399
01:56:50,638 --> 01:56:52,014
Don't worry, honey.

1400
01:56:55,101 --> 01:56:56,560
I got nine of 'em.

1401
01:56:56,685 --> 01:56:58,646
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1402
01:56:59,939 --> 01:57:01,232
Oh, God!

1403
01:57:10,533 --> 01:57:11,659
She won't get out of there alive.

1404
01:57:11,826 --> 01:57:14,412
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1405
01:57:14,495 --> 01:57:15,496
I have to stop her.

1406
01:57:15,663 --> 01:57:16,622
Don't you mean "we"?

1407
01:57:17,957 --> 01:57:19,500
I gotta do this my way.

1408
01:57:19,834 --> 01:57:20,835
And then what?

1409
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:23,087
We do what Riddler said.

1410
01:57:23,921 --> 01:57:25,548
Bring the rat into the light.

1411
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,544
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1412
01:58:03,627 --> 01:58:05,087
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1413
01:58:05,713 --> 01:58:07,047
Tell him it's about Annika.

1414
01:58:10,301 --> 01:58:11,635
Hey!

1415
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:13,888
Look who it is, huh?

1416
01:58:13,971 --> 01:58:16,390
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1417
01:58:16,474 --> 01:58:18,476
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1418
01:58:18,642 --> 01:58:20,102
Absolutely.

1419
01:58:21,854 --> 01:58:22,855
Alone?

1420
01:58:39,413 --> 01:58:40,498
Hey!

1421
01:58:51,050 --> 01:58:52,259
I'm just so worried.

1422
01:58:52,343 --> 01:58:53,969
I don't know where she is.

1423
01:58:55,721 --> 01:58:59,100
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1424
01:58:59,183 --> 01:59:02,603
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1425
01:59:04,105 --> 01:59:06,482
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1426
01:59:07,942 --> 01:59:09,068
I'm sorry.

1427
01:59:09,276 --> 01:59:10,361
It's okay.

1428
01:59:10,444 --> 01:59:12,571
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1429
01:59:12,738 --> 01:59:15,616
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1430
01:59:19,870 --> 01:59:20,788
Mr. Falcone?

1431
01:59:20,871 --> 01:59:22,331
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1432
01:59:22,415 --> 01:59:25,334
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1433
01:59:27,711 --> 01:59:29,213
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1434
01:59:29,296 --> 01:59:30,714
I'll be right back.

1435
01:59:46,021 --> 01:59:47,106
Holy shit.

1436

02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:02,663
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1442
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:04,498
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1443
02:00:04,582 --> 02:00:06,083
<i>The deal.</i>

1444
02:00:06,167 --> 02:00:10,963
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1445
02:00:11,046 --> 02:00:13,966
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1446
02:00:14,049 --> 02:00:16,594
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1447
02:00:16,677 --> 02:00:17,678
<i>Right.</i>

1448
02:00:18,554 --> 02:00:19,764
<i>Hmm.</i>

1449
02:00:19,847 --> 02:00:21,056
<i>Okay.</i>

1450
02:00:28,314 --> 02:00:30,691
<i>Revelations of
Mr. Falcone's secret role</i>

1451
02:00:30,775 --> 02:00:32,026
<i>as a mafia informant...</i>

1452
02:00:32,610 --> 02:00:33,861
Hey, Dad.

1453
02:00:34,904 --> 02:00:35,905
What?

1454
02:00:36,363 --> 02:00:38,407
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1455
02:00:40,034 --> 02:00:41,494
You remember her?

1456
02:00:43,537 --> 02:00:44,580
Yeah.

1457
02:00:48,876 --> 02:00:49,960
Just put down the gun, honey.

1458
02:00:50,044 --> 02:00:51,128
This is for my mother.

1459
02:01:48,394 --> 02:01:49,562
I see him!

1460
02:02:33,606 --> 02:02:35,357
You don't think this hurts me?

1461
02:02:39,945 --> 02:02:42,239
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1462
02:02:58,631 --> 02:03:00,466
You made me do this.

1463
02:03:01,884 --> 02:03:03,677
Just like your mother.

1464
02:03:09,683 --> 02:03:11,018
He has to pay!

1465
02:03:14,939 --> 02:03:16,065
You don't have to pay with him.

1466
02:03:19,693 --> 02:03:21,195
You paid enough.

1467
02:03:55,771 --> 02:03:56,897
Jesus.

1468
02:03:56,981 --> 02:03:59,692
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1469
02:03:59,775 --> 02:04:02,862
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1470
02:04:02,945 --> 02:04:04,196
I'm gonna start crying,

1471
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:06,782
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

1472
02:04:06,866 --> 02:04:08,492
Let me tell you something.

1473
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:10,286
Whatever I know,

1474
02:04:10,369 --> 02:04:12,246
whatever I've done,

1475
02:04:12,329 --> 02:04:16,667
it's all going with me to my grave.

1476
02:04:27,219 --> 02:04:29,180
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1477
02:04:30,806 --> 02:04:33,100
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1478
02:04:41,025 --> 02:04:43,360
I guess we don't all work for you.

1479
02:04:52,369 --> 02:04:53,913
You have the right to remain silent.

1480
02:04:54,747 --> 02:04:58,250
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1481
02:04:58,334 --> 02:04:59,668
You have the right to an attorney.

1482
02:04:59,752 --> 02:05:00,920
If you cannot afford one,

1483
02:05:01,003 --> 02:05:02,797
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1484
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,590
Do you understand these rights?

1485
02:05:06,092 --> 02:05:07,676
Do you understand?

1486
02:05:09,637 --> 02:05:10,721
Yeah.

1487
02:05:10,805 --> 02:05:12,890
I'll see you when I walk out.

1488
02:05:12,973 --> 02:05:13,974
With these rights in mind,

1489
02:05:14,058 --> 02:05:15,351
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1490
02:05:15,434 --> 02:05:16,685
Goddamn rat.

1491
02:05:18,646 --> 02:05:19,980
What'd you say?

1492
02:05:20,064 --> 02:05:21,816
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1493
02:05:22,942 --> 02:05:24,193
Probably be your last.

1494
02:05:24,443 --> 02:05:27,488
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1495
02:05:27,571 --> 02:05:28,656
Maybe I am.

1496
02:05:28,739 --> 02:05:29,949
Really, Oz?

1497
02:05:30,032 --> 02:05:34,745
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1498
02:05:34,829 --> 02:05:35,913
I'll spray paint your ass!

1499
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,085
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1500
02:05:41,544 --> 02:05:43,546
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1501
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,340
Get your hands off of me!

1502
02:06:05,901 --> 02:06:07,903
"Bring him into the light.

1503
02:06:11,490 --> 02:06:13,451
And you'll find where I'm at."

1504
02:06:13,534 --> 02:06:14,618
There!

1505
02:06:14,702 --> 02:06:16,537
The shots came from up there!

1506
02:06:18,122 --> 02:06:19,123
It's Riddler.

1507
02:06:21,208 --> 02:06:22,376
Gage, on me.

1508
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:25,171
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1509
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:40,579
He's gone.

1510
02:07:50,381 --> 02:07:52,341
He's been here this whole time.

1511
02:07:52,425 --> 02:07:54,760
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1512
02:07:54,844 --> 02:07:55,970
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

1513
02:07:56,053 --> 02:07:58,722
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

1514
02:07:58,806 --> 02:08:01,267
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

1515
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:04,270
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

1516
02:08:19,785 --> 02:08:21,871
Police! Hands up!

1517
02:08:24,915 --> 02:08:28,419
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1518
02:08:47,563 --> 02:08:49,482
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1519
02:08:52,443 --> 02:08:53,736
Stay still!

1520
02:08:53,819 --> 02:08:54,820
Now!

1521
02:09:23,474 --> 02:09:25,267
Which one is you?

1522
02:09:25,351 --> 02:09:26,852
You tell me.

1523
02:09:27,686 --> 02:09:29,146
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1524
02:09:32,233 --> 02:09:33,984
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1525
02:09:48,499 --> 02:09:51,419
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

1526
02:09:51,502 --> 02:09:54,088
<i>have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.</i>

1527
02:09:54,171 --> 02:09:56,757
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Reál's headquarters right now...</i>

1528
02:09:56,841 --> 02:09:57,883
Hey.

1529
02:10:22,324 --> 02:10:24,034
What are all these diaries?

1530
02:10:24,118 --> 02:10:26,537
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1531
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:30,166
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1532
02:10:30,249 --> 02:10:31,792
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1533
02:10:31,876 --> 02:10:34,170
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1534
02:10:34,253 --> 02:10:36,088
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1535
02:10:36,172 --> 02:10:38,591
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1536
02:10:38,674 --> 02:10:40,426
What about chain of evidence?

1537
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:42,470
You should see this.

1538
02:10:48,434 --> 02:10:49,935
He's wearing gloves.

1539
02:10:51,395 --> 02:10:53,647
"Friday, July 16th.

1540
02:10:53,731 --> 02:10:57,443
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1541
02:10:57,777 --> 02:11:00,821
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1542
02:11:00,905 --> 02:11:02,323
But then, today, I saw it.

1543
02:11:02,406 --> 02:11:06,535
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1544
02:11:07,870 --> 02:11:09,663
'Renewal.'

1545
02:11:09,747 --> 02:11:14,168
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1546
02:11:14,251 --> 02:11:17,379
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1547
02:11:17,463 --> 02:11:20,800
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1548
02:11:20,883 --> 02:11:23,344
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1549
02:11:23,427 --> 02:11:26,430
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1550
02:11:27,556 --> 02:11:29,391
"If you want people to understand,

1551
02:11:29,475 --> 02:11:31,310
really understand,

1552
02:11:31,393 --> 02:11:33,687
you can't just give them the answers.

1553
02:11:33,771 --> 02:11:35,231
You have to confront them,

1554
02:11:35,314 --> 02:11:37,733
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1555
02:11:37,817 --> 02:11:39,985
just like they tortured me.

1556
02:11:40,069 --> 02:11:42,863
I know now what I must become."

1557
02:11:45,825 --> 02:11:47,159
Jesus.

1558
02:11:53,249 --> 02:11:55,209
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1559
02:11:55,751 --> 02:11:57,253
This one's not a rat.

1560
02:12:13,894 --> 02:12:15,020
What is that?

1561
02:12:46,635 --> 02:12:47,845
Some kind of pry tool?

1562
02:12:47,928 --> 02:12:49,305
Is it a chisel?

1563
02:12:49,388 --> 02:12:50,848
It's a murder weapon.

1564
02:12:50,931 --> 02:12:52,308
He killed Mitchell with it.

1565
02:12:52,975 --> 02:12:55,853
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1566
02:13:04,445 --> 02:13:06,447
"My confession"?

1567
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:09,408
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1568
02:13:09,492 --> 02:13:10,868
This isn't over.

1569
02:13:10,951 --> 02:13:13,370
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1570
02:13:13,788 --> 02:13:15,998
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1571
02:13:24,090 --> 02:13:26,300
His final post was last night.

1572
02:13:26,383 --> 02:13:29,595
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1573
02:13:29,678 --> 02:13:32,681
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

1574
02:13:32,807 --> 02:13:36,227
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1575
02:13:47,571 --> 02:13:50,116
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1576
02:13:51,742 --> 02:13:53,452
"The Truth Unmasked."

1577
02:13:54,286 --> 02:13:55,913
I think I'm his last target.

1578
02:13:58,499 --> 02:13:59,583
You?

1579
02:13:59,959 --> 02:14:02,002
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1580
02:14:02,545 --> 02:14:03,921
What is?

1581
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:05,798
The Batman.

1582
02:14:11,178 --> 02:14:12,346
Yeah?

1583
02:14:23,649 --> 02:14:24,859
Right.

1584
02:14:27,737 --> 02:14:31,699
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1585
02:14:39,165 --> 02:14:40,666
You're a good cop.

1586
02:15:05,274 --> 02:15:07,651
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

1587
02:15:08,402 --> 02:15:10,237
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1588
02:15:10,321 --> 02:15:11,864
"Want"?

1589
02:15:12,448 --> 02:15:16,077
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

1590
02:15:17,286 --> 02:15:18,621
<i>For this moment.</i>

1591
02:15:19,663 --> 02:15:22,666
I've been invisible my whole life.

1592
02:15:23,751 --> 02:15:26,378
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1593
02:15:27,922 --> 02:15:30,341
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

1594
02:15:30,424 --> 02:15:32,259
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

1595
02:15:42,645 --> 02:15:44,605
<i>Bruce...</i>

1596
02:15:47,483 --> 02:15:49,318
<i>Wayne.</i>

1597
02:15:51,695 --> 02:15:55,449
Bruce...

1598
02:15:56,867 --> 02:15:59,745
<i>Wayne.</i>

1599
02:16:11,006 --> 02:16:13,426
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

1600
02:16:16,011 --> 02:16:19,390
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

1601
02:16:19,473 --> 02:16:21,851
<i>made all those promises.</i>

1602
02:16:24,311 --> 02:16:28,566
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

1603
02:16:29,108 --> 02:16:32,653
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

1604
02:16:32,737 --> 02:16:36,407
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1605
02:16:36,991 --> 02:16:38,534
<i>Orphan.</i>

1606
02:16:44,206 --> 02:16:49,336
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

1607
02:16:50,629 --> 02:16:55,259
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

1608
02:16:55,926 --> 02:16:57,470
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

1609
02:17:00,097 --> 02:17:02,767
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1610
02:17:03,142 --> 02:17:05,728
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

1611
02:17:07,021 --> 02:17:11,067
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

1612
02:17:12,777 --> 02:17:17,448
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

1613
02:17:18,616 --> 02:17:21,786
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

1614
02:17:21,869 --> 02:17:24,163
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1615
02:17:25,456 --> 02:17:28,042
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

1616
02:17:30,961 --> 02:17:34,131
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

1617
02:17:34,215 --> 02:17:37,134
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

1618
02:17:37,218 --> 02:17:38,219
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

1619
02:17:39,678 --> 02:17:41,722
<i>Bruce...</i>

1620
02:17:42,765 --> 02:17:44,683
<i>Wayne.</i>

1621
02:17:48,354 --> 02:17:51,440
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1622
02:17:54,860 --> 02:17:57,988
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

1623
02:17:59,448 --> 02:18:03,327
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

1624
02:18:06,497 --> 02:18:07,665
<i>God.</i>

1625
02:18:08,666 --> 02:18:09,959
<i>Look at you.</i>

1626
02:18:11,627 --> 02:18:14,088
Your mask is amazing.

1627
02:18:14,171 --> 02:18:17,091
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1628
02:18:17,174 --> 02:18:18,259
Ain't it funny?

1629
02:18:18,342 --> 02:18:22,763
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

1630
02:18:24,223 --> 02:18:26,267
<i>You and I both know</i>

1631
02:18:27,226 --> 02:18:29,728
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1632
02:18:29,812 --> 02:18:33,441
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1633
02:18:33,524 --> 02:18:35,067
<i>No shame,</i>

1634
02:18:35,985 --> 02:18:36,986
<i>no limits.</i>

1635
02:18:37,069 --> 02:18:38,738
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

1636
02:18:39,613 --> 02:18:40,614
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1637
02:18:40,698 --> 02:18:42,408
<i>All those cards.</i>

1638
02:18:42,491 --> 02:18:43,701
<i>I told you,</i>

1639
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:46,328
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

1640
02:18:46,412 --> 02:18:48,622
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

1641
02:18:48,706 --> 02:18:50,166
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1642
02:18:50,249 --> 02:18:52,251
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

1643
02:18:52,334 --> 02:18:53,502
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1644
02:18:53,586 --> 02:18:54,587
<i>We're not a team.</i>

1645
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:57,173
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1646
02:18:57,256 --> 02:18:59,675
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

1647
02:18:59,759 --> 02:19:02,928
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

1648
02:19:03,012 --> 02:19:04,638
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1649
02:19:04,722 --> 02:19:05,931
You gave me that.

1650
02:19:06,015 --> 02:19:07,141
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

1651
02:19:07,224 --> 02:19:09,810
You showed me what was possible.

1652
02:19:09,894 --> 02:19:14,774
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

1653
02:19:14,857 --> 02:19:16,400
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1654
02:19:16,484 --> 02:19:17,985
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

1655
02:19:19,111 --> 02:19:20,196
<i>What?</i>

1656
02:19:20,279 --> 02:19:22,448
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

1657
02:19:22,531 --> 02:19:23,908
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1658
02:19:23,991 --> 02:19:25,493
You think you'll be remembered?

1659
02:19:25,576 --> 02:19:27,244
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

1660
02:19:27,745 --> 02:19:29,497
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

1661
02:19:29,580 --> 02:19:31,248
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

1662
02:19:31,332 --> 02:19:32,374
<i>No, no!</i>

1663
02:19:32,458 --> 02:19:33,375
<i>A nobody!</i>

1664
02:19:35,169 --> 02:19:36,962
<i>No!</i>

1665
02:19:38,881 --> 02:19:41,258
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1666
02:19:41,509 --> 02:19:44,095
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

1667
02:19:45,054 --> 02:19:48,682
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1668
02:19:48,766 --> 02:19:51,393
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

1669
02:19:52,394 --> 02:19:54,396
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

1670
02:19:54,772 --> 02:19:58,067
We could watch the whole thing together.

1671
02:19:58,150 --> 02:19:59,151
<i>Watch what?</i>

1672
02:19:59,235 --> 02:20:00,986
<i>Everything!</i>

1673
02:20:09,328 --> 02:20:10,996
<i>It was all there.</i>

1674
02:20:13,165 --> 02:20:15,501
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

1675
02:20:19,797 --> 02:20:23,717
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

1676
02:20:25,761 --> 02:20:27,847
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

1677
02:20:28,305 --> 02:20:29,557
<i>What have you done?</i>

1678
02:20:30,266 --> 02:20:35,146
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

1679
02:20:37,982 --> 02:20:39,817
<i>You.</i>

1680
02:20:41,485 --> 02:20:43,612
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

1681
02:20:44,947 --> 02:20:46,490
<i>What have you done?</i>

1682
02:20:48,033 --> 02:20:53,873
<i>Ave Maria</i>

1683
02:20:54,290 --> 02:20:56,167
<i>What have you done?</i>

1684
02:20:58,627 --> 02:21:00,004
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1685
02:21:00,171 --> 02:21:01,589
<i>What have you done?</i>

1686
02:21:05,593 --> 02:21:08,971
<i>Maria</i>

1687
02:21:09,138 --> 02:21:14,685
<i>Gratia plena</i>

02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:47,927
Hey!

02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:50,221
What are you doing in here?

1690
02:22:08,155 --> 02:22:10,741
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1691
02:22:17,331 --> 02:22:19,792
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1692
02:22:20,668 --> 02:22:23,421
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1693
02:22:28,092 --> 02:22:31,137
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1695
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:35,724
It's a tucker.

1696
02:22:53,534 --> 02:22:54,535
Huh.

1697
02:23:09,717 --> 02:23:12,511
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1698
02:23:12,595 --> 02:23:14,096
What are you doing?

1699
02:23:44,627 --> 02:23:46,045
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

1716

<i>masquerading under the guise of renewal.</i>

1717

<i>And now it is time</i>

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

<i>Those who are not washed away</i>

You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

1756
02:27:38,110 --> 02:27:39,779
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

1757
02:27:39,862 --> 02:27:41,363
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1758
02:27:41,447 --> 02:27:43,282
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1759
02:27:43,365 --> 02:27:44,617
We got an active situation.

1760
02:27:44,742 --> 02:27:46,035
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1761
02:27:46,118 --> 02:27:47,328
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

1762
02:27:47,411 --> 02:27:48,329
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

1763
02:27:48,412 --> 02:27:49,246
Come!

1764
02:28:25,282 --> 02:28:26,700
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

1765
02:28:26,784 --> 02:28:27,660
...we're gonna have huge problems.

1766
02:28:27,743 --> 02:28:29,120
The water's already started to breach.

1767
02:28:29,203 --> 02:28:30,746
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

1768
02:28:30,830 --> 02:28:33,040
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1769
02:28:33,124 --> 02:28:34,959
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1770
02:28:35,042 --> 02:28:37,378
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

1771
02:28:37,461 --> 02:28:39,713
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

1772
02:28:39,797 --> 02:28:42,049
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1773
02:28:42,133 --> 02:28:43,968
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1774
02:28:44,051 --> 02:28:47,054
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1775
02:28:47,138 --> 02:28:48,639
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1776
02:28:53,811 --> 02:28:57,273
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1777
02:28:57,356 --> 02:28:59,650
Please! I just need your attention!

1778
02:29:15,541 --> 02:29:16,667
You're okay!

1779
02:30:47,591 --> 02:30:50,219
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1780
02:30:50,302 --> 02:30:51,512
Follow me, sir.

1781
02:33:01,517 --> 02:33:03,018
No, no. It's okay.

1782
02:33:03,102 --> 02:33:04,145
It's okay.

1783
02:33:05,312 --> 02:33:06,355
It's okay.

1784
02:33:07,982 --> 02:33:10,109
It's done now. It's done.

1785
02:33:12,820 --> 02:33:14,155
It's over.

1786
02:34:10,002 --> 02:34:13,464
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1787
02:34:14,173 --> 02:34:16,509
Take it easy. Easy.

1788
02:34:45,079 --> 02:34:46,205
Jesus.

1789
02:34:56,048 --> 02:34:57,716
Who the hell are you?

1790
02:35:01,929 --> 02:35:02,930
Me?

1791
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:07,518
I'm Vengeance.

1792
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:42,274
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1793
02:38:45,486 --> 02:38:47,363
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1794
02:38:49,698 --> 02:38:51,450
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1795
02:38:53,744 --> 02:38:55,746
<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

1796
02:38:56,664 --> 02:38:58,290
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1797
02:39:01,502 --> 02:39:05,214
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

1798
02:39:05,297 --> 02:39:07,842
<i>in the parts of the city
no one can get to.</i>

1799
02:39:09,009 --> 02:39:12,721
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

1800
02:39:15,683 --> 02:39:18,811
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

1801
02:39:20,187 --> 02:39:21,564
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

1802
02:39:22,189 --> 02:39:23,649
But not just our city.

1803
02:39:24,358 --> 02:39:28,571
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1804
02:39:28,654 --> 02:39:30,740
in our elected officials,

1805
02:39:30,823 --> 02:39:32,116
in each other.

1806
02:39:32,908 --> 02:39:36,245
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1807
02:39:40,583 --> 02:39:42,251
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1808
02:39:43,711 --> 02:39:45,880
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1809
02:39:47,965 --> 02:39:49,884
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1810
02:39:52,261 --> 02:39:55,306
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1811
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:59,018
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1812
02:40:01,437 --> 02:40:03,481
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1813
02:40:06,567 --> 02:40:08,194
<i>People need hope.</i>

1814
02:40:09,403 --> 02:40:11,614
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1815
02:40:15,409 --> 02:40:17,078
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1816
02:40:17,995 --> 02:40:19,371
<i>scarred,</i>

1817
02:40:20,289 --> 02:40:21,540
<i>like me.</i>

1818
02:40:23,667 --> 02:40:25,753
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1819
02:40:27,129 --> 02:40:29,840
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1820
02:40:31,467 --> 02:40:33,219
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1821
02:40:34,720 --> 02:40:36,597
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1822
02:40:38,474 --> 02:40:40,392
<i>They can give us the power</i>

1823
02:40:41,352 --> 02:40:42,853
<i>to endure...</i>

1824
02:40:44,230 --> 02:40:46,357
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1825
02:40:49,276 --> 02:40:51,445
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

1826
02:40:51,529 --> 02:40:54,323
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

1827
02:40:54,407 --> 02:40:55,991
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

1828
02:40:56,075 --> 02:40:57,701
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

1829
02:40:57,785 --> 02:41:00,788
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

1830
02:41:00,871 --> 02:41:03,416
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

1831
02:41:03,499 --> 02:41:05,835
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

1832
02:41:05,918 --> 02:41:08,379
Isn't that just terrible?

1833
02:41:09,755 --> 02:41:11,674
Him...

1834
02:41:11,757 --> 02:41:14,635
raining on your parade like that?

1835
02:41:20,349 --> 02:41:22,351
What is it they say?

1836
02:41:23,519 --> 02:41:25,688
"One day you're on top,

1837
02:41:27,231 --> 02:41:28,899
the next...

1838
02:41:30,276 --> 02:41:32,194
you're a clown."

1839
02:41:34,572 --> 02:41:35,740
Well,

1840
02:41:37,533 --> 02:41:40,369
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1841
02:41:42,663 --> 02:41:45,332
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1842
02:41:46,625 --> 02:41:48,461
You did so well.

1843
02:41:52,965 --> 02:41:53,966
And you know,

1844
02:41:55,634 --> 02:41:58,846
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1845
02:42:08,898 --> 02:42:10,274
Who are you?

1846
02:42:10,816 --> 02:42:13,235
Well, that's the question,

1847
02:42:14,487 --> 02:42:15,654
isn't it?

1848
02:42:18,574 --> 02:42:20,951
Riddle me this...

1849
02:42:23,412 --> 02:42:25,539
"The less of them you have,

1850
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:30,127
the more one is worth."

1851
02:42:35,549 --> 02:42:37,301
A friend.

1852
02:43:03,536 --> 02:43:04,537
You're leaving.

1853
02:43:05,454 --> 02:43:06,539
Jesus.

1854
02:43:08,290 --> 02:43:09,875
Don't you ever just say hello?

1855
02:43:14,964 --> 02:43:16,382
Where will you go?

1856
02:43:17,883 --> 02:43:20,302
I don't know. Upstate.

1857
02:43:20,719 --> 02:43:22,430
Bludhaven, maybe.

1858
02:43:23,305 --> 02:43:24,306
Why?

1859
02:43:25,516 --> 02:43:26,725
You asking me to stay?

1860
02:43:33,774 --> 02:43:35,901
You know this place
is never gonna change.

1861
02:43:36,318 --> 02:43:38,654
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1862
02:43:38,738 --> 02:43:40,656
There's gonna be a power grab.

1863
02:43:42,283 --> 02:43:43,409
It'll be bloody.

1864
02:43:44,034 --> 02:43:45,244
I know.

1865
02:43:46,787 --> 02:43:47,872
But the city can change.

1866
02:43:47,955 --> 02:43:49,206
It won't.

1867
02:43:50,332 --> 02:43:51,333
I have to try.

1868
02:43:51,417 --> 02:43:53,210
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1869
02:43:55,504 --> 02:43:56,630
Listen.

1870
02:43:59,049 --> 02:44:00,301
Why don't you come with me?

1871
02:44:01,260 --> 02:44:02,762
Get into some trouble.

1872
02:44:03,512 --> 02:44:07,016
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1873
02:44:07,683 --> 02:44:09,310
The bat and the cat.

1874
02:44:10,811 --> 02:44:12,480
It's got a nice ring.

1875
02:44:25,826 --> 02:44:27,244
Who am I kidding?

1876
02:44:28,704 --> 02:44:30,831
You're already spoken for.

1877
02:44:42,718 --> 02:44:44,136
You should go.

1878
02:44:52,478 --> 02:44:53,479
Selina...

1879
02:44:57,566 --> 02:44:59,235
Take care of yourself.
