2
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,577
Oh, sh... shit!

3
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,115
You are, uh, nervous.

4
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:09,718
It's okay.

5
00:05:09,752 --> 00:05:12,587
When I first saw you,
I said to myself,

6
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,790
"This is a man that knows
what he wants."

7
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:20,295
He's just, uh, afraid.

8
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,906
Well, I'm not afraid,
it's just that I...

9
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,933
I know, I know,
It... it is just the way...

10
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:27,302
things are.

11
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:30,305
But a man must pay
to get what he wants.

12
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:31,672
Hmm?

13
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:38,748
That is why...
we're all here, yes?

14
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,756
Yeah.

15
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,064
Go talk to her.

16
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:57,666
Come on.

17
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,271
She's very sweet.

18
00:06:01,304 --> 00:06:02,906
Leon: You'll see.

19
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:25,128
Beatriz!

20
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:36,240
<i>Hola.</i>

21
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:37,741
Hi.

22
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,679
You wanna show me
what you're drawing?

23
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:45,716
I'd rather not.

24
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:55,092
It's Beatriz, right?

25
00:06:58,262 --> 00:06:59,262
Bedroom.

26
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,280
Ah, li... listen, why, wh...
Why don't we just talk first?

27
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:16,715
Okay?

28
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:18,326
You don't want to waste
time with talking.

29
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,285
It's okay.

30
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:22,020
H... how old are you?

31
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:23,288
How old do you like?

32
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:24,823
No, that's not what I meant.

33
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,791
I just want to get to know you,

34
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:28,102
g... g... get to know who you are.

35
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,828
- You like thirteen?
- Come on, no, please!

36
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,730
- Twelve?
- No.

37
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,769
Shit!

38
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,272
Beatriz: Papa! Papa!

39
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:53,186
Linda: FBI! Drop the gun
right now, asshole! Drop it!

40
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:56,255
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you too, pal!

41
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:58,424
- I die, she dies.
- Hey, Leon!

42
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:10,069
Put the gun down. Put it down!

43
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:11,480
Nobody said anything
about going back.

44
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:13,206
We can talk about all that,

45
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,807
when everybody's safe, okay?

46
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,943
You've lied! You all lied!

47
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:19,779
You don't want to hurt her, man.
She's your daughter.

48
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:22,215
- Okay? She needs you.
- You don't know shit.

49
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:23,816
I know you don't want this.

50
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:26,219
None of us wants this, okay?

51
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:27,486
Come on, you're a father.

52
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,488
Put the gun down.

53
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:37,230
Beatriz: Papa! Papa!

54
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,168
Papa!

55
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,369
Papa!

56
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:43,842
- Let go of me!
- Linda: Beatriz, no.

57
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,939
- Come on, get back!
- Papa! Papa!

58
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:48,041
- Get her back!
- Let go!

59
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:49,343
Beatriz: Papa!

60
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:50,376
Let go!

61
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,291
Papa Leon?

62
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:07,861
Yeah, I, uh...

63
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:10,197
Hold on, Serra, I wanna
make sure I'm clear on this.

64
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,299
The lynchpin, the key
to your whole investigation

65
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:14,410
is laying in a meat wagon
with his brains smashed in?

66
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:17,271
Linda: Vincent saved lives, sir.
The fucker was going out messy.

67
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:18,872
I don't care, Amistead.

68
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,074
What I care about,
is an eleven month investigation

69
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:22,876
that has taken
considerable resources

70
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,212
on both sides of the border.

71
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:27,048
- Is now well and truly fucked.
- Not necessarily.

72
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:28,983
Nussbaum: Don't add
insult to injury.

73
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,885
An undocumented child
is not something

74
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,520
we build a trafficking case on.

75
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,289
Well, what the fuck is?

76
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,456
Sir.

77
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,891
We'll talk in the morning.

78
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,287
Mauricio.

79
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,591
Alex!

80
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,595
What's this? What's this?

81
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,369
Oh, my God, has she grown!

82
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,071
- Hmm.
- What a sweet kid!

83
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:59,376
Ah, Pinches horses... expensive.

84
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,611
- Less than a divorce, I guess.
- Yeah!

85
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,517
Nice work in Guadalajara.

86
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,253
That city is a fucking shithole.

87
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,554
Same as here.

88
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,223
I hate cities, the crowds,

89
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,392
the smells, the fucking <i>gueros.</i>

90
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:19,262
- No of fence.
- None taken.

91
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:21,498
Country's better now,
don't you think?

92
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,533
Remember Tamalpais?

93
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:26,536
Those were Zeta scumbags.

94
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,972
Crazy days. Fun though, huh?

95
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,674
Uh, not exactly my idea
of fun, Mauricio.

96
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,943
Right...

97
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:36,346
You're sensitive. An <i>artist a.</i>

98
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,648
Jesus. Cheer up!

99
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,551
Life is good now. It's calmer.

100
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:42,186
More money, less blood.

101
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:45,990
Our friends got you
something nice.

102
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:50,594
Mauri, you want someone else.

103
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,663
I'm not up for it right now.

104
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:54,231
Mauricio: Get up for it.

105
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:56,300
Job's in El Paso.
You're from there, right?

106
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,702
Alex: Another reason to say no.

107
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:01,338
I'm trying to tell you,
I'm getting out.

108
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,418
Uh, an iced tea, <i>por favor.</i>

109
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,062
The fuck?

110
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:26,164
You drunk?

111
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,303
U... uh, no, no, just tired.

112
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:35,741
Alex. I need you on this.

113
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:37,375
You know the town.

114
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:42,481
It's too much.

115
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:44,249
The job is for two.

116
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,552
Don't you have
a brother in El Paso?

117
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,392
Mauri...

118
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:57,763
Are you spying on me?

119
00:12:57,797 --> 00:13:00,131
Mauricio: It's our job
to know things, Alex.

120
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:03,101
So stop talking this
retirement shit.

121
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:05,972
Men like us don't retire.

122
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:10,738
Receptionist: Here you go
Mr. Marshall, you're all set.

123
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:13,373
Anything else I can do for you?

124
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:14,408
Mr. Marshall?

125
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:21,081
No, no, thank you. I'm fine.

126
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,450
The room number again?

127
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:25,686
11-0-6. It's on the key holder.

128
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:28,488
Ah, yes. Thank you.

129
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,260
Vodka Martini, please.

130
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:11,633
So, too early in the day
for a glass of wine?

131
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,902
Or too late for a Bloody Mary?

132
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,804
Guess that depends
on what kind of day

133
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,238
you wanna have.

134
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:18,874
That's up to you, isn't it?

135
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,782
Are you alone?

136
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:27,516
Not right now.

137
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:28,852
Excuse me.

138
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:37,526
- Pleasant trip?
- Let's get on with it.

139
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,533
Uh, yes, he's here.

140
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:48,604
He looks like what you'd expect.

141
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:50,305
I'm sure he'll be fine.

142
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:53,175
Alright. Bye now.

143
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,552
Your people said
this will be done quickly.

144
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:05,254
And it will.

145
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:09,224
I'm gonna need a little more
specificity than that.

146
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:10,928
No, you won't.

147
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:12,730
The less you know, the better.

148
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,901
I was trying to save him.

149
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:24,635
You are a liar.

150
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,805
Look, Beatriz,
what happened to you.

151
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,440
What Papa did, it ain't right.

152
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:30,742
Now, it's not your fault.

153
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,319
- No child should be treated...
- Papa said...

154
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,880
"It is how you pay to be free."

155
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:36,848
It was better than here.

156
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:44,824
- I brought you these.
- I don't want them!

157
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,596
Vincent: Listen, there is, uh,

158
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,399
a special visa for...
people like you

159
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:56,111
to stay in the US,
while we're working on your...

160
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:57,502
You want me to tell.

161
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,538
It's wrong that you're
locked up here

162
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:01,540
while the men who did
things to you are out there.

163
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:03,042
Papa said to never tell.

164
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:10,515
I'm gonna have you transferred

165
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,385
to Child Protective Services,
okay?

166
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:15,822
They'll put you in a group home.
Not lock you up.

167
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:18,090
Now, I don't expect anything
in return.

168
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:19,658
Okay, if you wanna talk,
you can talk.

169
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,459
If you don't wanna,
you don't have to.

170
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,847
Looks like I'm going solo
tonight.

171
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,647
Ellis: I gotta get this done.

172
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:44,383
I've got a permit filing
downtown.

173
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,652
- Downtown?
- Yeah, I work, Wendy.

174
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:49,122
Contracts don't just
jump in the boat.

175
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:52,125
- Ellis: Don't wait up for me.
- Ellis?

176
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,863
- Yeah?
- Her perfume fucking stinks.

177
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,832
Wash it off before you
come home, will you?

178
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,584
Oh, shit!

179
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,658
Please!

180
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:27,561
- Please!
- You know why I'm here!

181
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:29,063
It's... it's all
a misunderstanding.

182
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:30,832
It's always a misunderstanding.

183
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:32,066
- M... Please!
- Where?

184
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:36,503
It's... it's in the safe.
Upstairs. Please!

185
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:37,872
Don't do this!

186
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:41,475
I didn't, I didn't
say anything, alright?

187
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:43,187
It wasn't, it wasn't
supposed to go this far.

188
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,612
If I'm here, it's gone too far.

189
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:48,448
Ellis: It's here, alright! Okay!

190
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:50,051
- Okay.
- Open it!

191
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,120
Alright, I just... Okay.

192
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,964
Look, if I give it to you...

193
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:03,631
- Come on!
- Alright.

194
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:08,070
Girl 1: Oh, Dad? You home?

195
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:11,206
I'm going over to Annabelle's.

196
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:15,811
I'll probably stay over, okay?

197
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:19,514
Girl 1: Just letting you know.

198
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,173
Maybe you want to do that later.

199
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,707
Uh-huh, I'm multi-tasking.

200
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:54,278
Yeah, well I just
don't wanna die today.

201
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:00,495
How can you live in Texas
and not speak Spanish?

202
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:05,856
Fucking owl!

203
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,369
Hey, Danny. Where is he?

204
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,670
Besides stomping
all over my crime scene?

205
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:20,772
He's out there.

206
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,853
Agent Serra, Agent Amistead,
this is Mrs. Van Camp.

207
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,327
Wendy, I guarantee
these are two of my best.

208
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,662
Just tell them what you told me.

209
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:47,999
Ellis was...

210
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,103
It was a robbery.

211
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,838
The safe was opened.

212
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,807
And you've told this
to Detective Mora?

213
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,111
I haven't talked to the police.

214
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,012
I called Gerald first.

215
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,152
Well, I'm... I'm sure
Special Agent Nussbaum

216
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,121
has made it clear to you,
the more people we have

217
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,822
working on this early on...

218
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,390
the better our chances
of solving it.

219
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,692
Uh, so, I'm gonna go get
Detective Mora,

220
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,095
just so you don't have
to repeat yourself.

221
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,130
Excuse me.

222
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,770
You wanna come outside
and take her statement?

223
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,207
So...

224
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,743
your boss trying to get some
or is he already getting it?

225
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,011
That's real nice, Mora.

226
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,247
Sexualizing the wife
of a murder victim.

227
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,381
No one asked for you guys.

228
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,849
He just parachuted in on this.

229
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,160
Yeah, couldn't agree
with you more.

230
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,684
This is your investigation.

231
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,963
But let's just do this, together

232
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,890
and then I'll get Nussbaum
off your back.

233
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,192
I don't need to cut a deal.

234
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:48,262
Can you just not be an asshole
all the time?

235
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:50,297
Just say "yes", Danny.

236
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,199
- Yes, Danny.
- Okay, let's go.

237
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:00,874
Vincent: Mrs. Van Camp,
this is Detective Danny Mora.

238
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:04,710
Sorry for your loss, ma'am.

239
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:06,747
When's the last time
you saw your husband alive?

240
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,715
Last night... around 9:00.

241
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,885
I... I was going
to an art opening.

242
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,189
And Ellis was...

243
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:18,025
He was going to file permits.

244
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:21,727
Sounds like your husband
had something on the side.

245
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:26,466
I assumed that he was,
um, meeting a friend.

246
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,103
- You have her number, or his...
- Gerald: Linda.

247
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:32,307
Let's have Agent Serra
continue the interview.

248
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,275
I can get you her number.

249
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,077
Thank you, ma'am.

250
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,912
You have any business dealings

251
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:40,949
that went bad, anyone you know
might wanna hurt him?

252
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:42,984
Wendy: Uh, I... I... I don't know.

253
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,721
Please help me!

254
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:51,725
What am I gonna say to Em?

255
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:04,906
Don't expect too much.

256
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,874
When the onset of Alzheimer's
is this sudden...

257
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:08,943
I know how it starts.

258
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:18,854
Hey, pal.

259
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:22,258
It's me, Alex, your brother.

260
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:23,959
You're looking good.

261
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:27,863
Guess what?

262
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:30,065
I found this the other day.

263
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:33,836
1969. Made me think of you.

264
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:37,306
You remember that year?
Huh? The draft?

265
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:39,008
The Suns and the Bucks.

266
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,177
Both tied
for the First Round Pick.

267
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:45,881
Down to a coin flip...
Phoenix calls heads.

268
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:51,120
Yeah, it was tails.

269
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:53,989
And the goddamn Bucks
get Lew Alcindor.

270
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,197
Yeah, I don't watch
basketball much anymore.

271
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:07,003
Can't say I remember
the last time I did.

272
00:26:55,086 --> 00:26:57,221
Hugo: My Captain
called this morning.

273
00:26:57,254 --> 00:26:59,056
Apparently,
I'm no longer needed.

274
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,991
Good, I'm glad everybody's here.

275
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:03,894
So... in light of what happened
with the Papa Leon raid

276
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:06,197
the Task Force
is being reorganized.

277
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,466
Detective Marquez will be
heading back to Mexico.

278
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:09,633
We're not done, sir.

279
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,244
Cooperation with
the Mexican Police has...

280
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:13,504
We're done, Serra,
I've spent the last three days

281
00:27:13,537 --> 00:27:16,407
getting an earful from
Washington, facts are facts.

282
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,909
This has been a wide reaching
international investigation

283
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:20,611
and we got nothing
to show for it.

284
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:24,291
You have something
you wanna say, Marquez?

285
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:26,117
It's not nothing, sir.

286
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,518
We've gotten plenty in Mexico.

287
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:33,258
Hugo: But as soon as we come
into the US, things get, uh...

288
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,394
I don't know, maybe your ears
in Washington

289
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:37,396
just don't wanna hear.

290
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:41,500
It's pretty obvious
the appetite for big fish,

291
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:43,001
ends at the border.

292
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:44,312
I don't like what
you're insinuating, Marquez.

293
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:47,139
I don't think I was
insinuating anything.

294
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:48,540
Was saying it pretty flat out.

295
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:50,275
Hugo has a point, sir.

296
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:52,420
We've never gotten anywhere
with the US-based <i>Padrote.</i>

297
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:54,012
If there even is such a thing.

298
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:57,315
The word was Papa Leon served
rich men. White men.

299
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,984
"The Word," is that
what you people

300
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:00,419
build cases on in Juarez?

301
00:28:00,452 --> 00:28:01,653
We have Papa Leon on tape

302
00:28:01,686 --> 00:28:03,088
bragging about his clientele.

303
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,424
Look, I know you take
this personally.

304
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:07,259
But the well's gone dry.

305
00:28:10,595 --> 00:28:12,707
I know you don't want to believe
there's a white <i>Padrote,</i>

306
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:14,342
but shutting down a case
don't make it so.

307
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:16,302
- Watch yourself, Serra.
- We have a witness.

308
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:18,004
What we have...

309
00:28:18,037 --> 00:28:19,348
is an undocumented minor
in detention.

310
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:21,307
What we have
is a severely traumatized,

311
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,409
undocumented minor in detention.

312
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:25,311
And she's the only
valuable witness we have.

313
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:26,688
Gerald: When were you gonna
tell me you offered.

314
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:28,948
Beatriz Leon a T-1 visa?

315
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:30,650
I was coming to that.

316
00:28:30,683 --> 00:28:31,684
To notify me of the deal

317
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:33,319
you're not authorized to make?

318
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:35,121
With a witness in
a case you haven't made?

319
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:36,757
I thought helping kids
like Beatriz Leon

320
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,324
was part of our job.

321
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:41,093
- She's eligible.
- Gerald: The Task Force is done.

322
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:43,296
And that is straight
from Washington.

323
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:46,065
As for Beatriz, we can T-1 her
and move her to a group home,

324
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:48,468
but you need to focus
on the Van Camp murder.

325
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:50,269
That's El Paso PD, every day.

326
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:53,005
You want to help a kid
like Beatriz?

327
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,507
You play ball on the homicide.

328
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,481
Yeah, okay.

329
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:04,618
Thank you, sir.

330
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:06,487
Good.

331
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,121
Coleman, Howe.

332
00:29:08,155 --> 00:29:10,190
You'll have new
duty assignments this week.

333
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:12,092
Detective Marquez,
on behalf of the Bureau

334
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,561
and the United States,
I thank you for your service.

335
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,316
I saw the paperwork,
is she a witness or victim?

336
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:41,417
Both.

337
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,185
I'll reach out
to Social Services,

338
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,588
see what we can do
about counseling and school.

339
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:47,122
That would be great.

340
00:30:47,156 --> 00:30:48,333
Is there any family
on either side

341
00:30:48,357 --> 00:30:50,225
of the border
I should know about?

342
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:52,728
No, the father was a trafficker.

343
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:54,330
- Hm.
- I'm gonna say goodbye.

344
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:56,098
I'll keep you posted.

345
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:04,440
I think you're
gonna be okay here.

346
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,477
You asked me before, at Papa's,

347
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,179
what I was drawing.

348
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:14,183
It is a desert.

349
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:16,219
I draw deserts.

350
00:31:16,252 --> 00:31:18,889
So you do, look at that.

351
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:21,658
Keep it.

352
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:31,167
I'll come back
to see you soon, okay?

353
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:32,736
I promise you.

354
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:40,666
For fuck's sake.

355
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:51,044
She's a child.

356
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:53,346
- And that's a problem?
- I won't do it.

357
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,348
Your people knew
who the contract was for.

358
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:57,818
I fucking won't do it.
Are you deaf?

359
00:33:57,851 --> 00:33:59,619
William: Well, maybe
I'll call Mexico City,

360
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:00,930
see what they
have to say about that.

361
00:34:00,954 --> 00:34:02,522
Alex: No, no.

362
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:06,526
No, you're gonna call
the contract off.

363
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,528
The fuck I am.

364
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:10,798
You're an employee!
I don't take fucking...

365
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:21,075
Alex: You want this? Huh?

366
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:22,877
You call the contract off.

367
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:25,546
You really don't know
what you're playing with.

368
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:32,020
Oh, yes, I do.

369
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:38,092
Mr. Borden.

370
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:42,663
Of 22 Bienveneda Avenue,
Silver Springs.

371
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:46,466
The girl stays alive.

372
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,570
Or you're answerable to me.

373
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:50,737
Asshole.

374
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,857
No, no speeches or awards,
please.

375
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,792
My donation isn't about me.

376
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:15,430
Yes, you are correct.

377
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:17,599
That is the amount
I'm prepared to give,

378
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,869
however any construction funding

379
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:22,637
by this donation cannot be named.

380
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,472
"The Davana Sealman Wing."

381
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:27,142
It must be simply,
"The Sealman Wing."

382
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:29,144
I'm sure you understand.

383
00:35:29,178 --> 00:35:31,713
Giving like this
is generational.

384
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:39,454
Is he still on the line?

385
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:41,489
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dr. Myers?

386
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:43,491
Assistant: He cleared security
three minutes ago.

387
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:45,895
Have him wait,
until I'm done with this.

388
00:35:45,928 --> 00:35:47,496
Thank you.

389
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:56,505
I thought I was clear.

390
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:58,507
Never on the office number.

391
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,017
William on speaker: He knows.

392
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,584
That's a bit vague.

393
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:10,186
He knows my name, where I live,

394
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,588
and he won't do the job,
and he's got...

395
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:14,791
He's got Van Camp's
flash drives.

396
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:17,193
You said he wasn't
going to be a problem.

397
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:19,461
I'm going to call Mexico City.

398
00:36:19,495 --> 00:36:21,463
That's one solution.

399
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:23,767
An obvious and unsubtle one.

400
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:26,502
What does he want?

401
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:28,080
To have the contract on the girl
called off.

402
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,738
We do that, he turns
over the info.

403
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,607
There's something
to be said for that.

404
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,244
William on speaker:
You can't trust him.

405
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:35,478
I didn't say I trusted him.

406
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:37,181
I said, I see his point of view.

407
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:39,951
Look, I know
what's on that drive.

408
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:42,552
Randy's pretty obvious
about his quirks.

409
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:43,888
This is not a conversation

410
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:45,823
I'm comfortable
having with you, William.

411
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:48,092
William on speaker:
Oh, Jesus Christ, he knows!

412
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,693
About the girl, about me.

413
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:51,062
Davana: I'll handle it.

414
00:36:51,095 --> 00:36:52,729
And don't call me again.

415
00:36:57,534 --> 00:36:58,735
Man 1: Honestly, how it works,

416
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:01,105
if you want my opinion,
is this the truth?

417
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:02,974
Mm-hmm.

418
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:05,109
Thank you kind, sir.

419
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:07,644
Okay, as I was saying,
the truth...

420
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:09,981
Well, well, wait. My bad.

421
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:12,249
Cheers, again.

422
00:37:12,283 --> 00:37:14,684
So, maybe we
should just go upstairs,

423
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:16,921
make some sort of a deal,
'cause at the end of the day,

424
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:18,023
all I want is a blowie.

425
00:37:18,056 --> 00:37:19,992
Keep your voice down.

426
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:21,893
Shh, we got a deal.

427
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:22,995
I'll keep my voice down,

428
00:37:23,028 --> 00:37:24,729
but we still got to negotiate.

429
00:37:24,763 --> 00:37:27,531
Hey, leave the lady alone, pal.

430
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:28,867
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, pops.

431
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,735
First of all,
this ain't no lady.

432
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:32,804
Which you're about to find out

433
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:34,538
right about now,
am I right. Babe?

434
00:37:34,572 --> 00:37:37,209
No, you're drunk. Go to bed.

435
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:39,543
Okay, can you do us a favor,
please

436
00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:41,013
and get the fuck out of here...

437
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:44,850
Fuck!

438
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:47,718
Are you fucking kidding me?

439
00:37:48,186 --> 00:37:49,755
Fuck you!

440
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:04,669
Thank you.

441
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:08,640
I'm sorry. It's embarrassing.

442
00:38:08,673 --> 00:38:10,109
He's just a drunk at a bar,

443
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:13,146
being an asshole in front
of a beautiful lady.

444
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:14,947
Happens all the time.

445
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:48,982
<i>Gracias.</i>

446
00:38:53,253 --> 00:38:54,922
Tequila!

447
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:10,237
Oh, come on, at least
I'm trying, Hugo.

448
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,839
U-go.

449
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,842
U-go.

450
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,676
Ugo.

451
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,246
They just don't wanna know,
do they?

452
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:21,115
Take the little victories.

453
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:23,016
Beatriz is out of detention.

454
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:35,162
Why six?

455
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:38,133
You don't want to know.

456
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:40,135
Actually, I do.

457
00:39:41,903 --> 00:39:45,140
I was working on a case
in Juarez.

458
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:46,774
The Dead Girls.

459
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:50,812
Imagine, so many women disappear

460
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:53,248
and you can't do nothing.

461
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:55,716
They say everyone
has their number.

462
00:39:55,749 --> 00:39:58,887
For the police they're all
just numbers.

463
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,855
Six?

464
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:03,191
Emiliana Manteras
was 13 years old.

465
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:05,894
Left her job at a
Maquilladora and disappeared.

466
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:07,395
Just gone.

467
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:08,830
Four months later,
a couple of kids

468
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:10,298
found her body in a dump.

469
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,002
Her mother, her sisters.

470
00:40:15,303 --> 00:40:17,071
They were strong.

471
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:18,974
They plastered Emiliana's
photo on the walls

472
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:21,076
of headquarters in all the city.

473
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:23,479
The problem wasn't
that no one knew

474
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:24,980
what happened to the girl.

475
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:27,449
Everyone knew.

476
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:29,251
Emiliana got into a car
with a soldier.

477
00:40:29,285 --> 00:40:30,953
Arturo Pontilla.

478
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:33,455
Pontilla liked to party
with the Narcos.

479
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:34,790
I followed him.

480
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:36,926
I built the case quietly.

481
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,460
But since Pontilla was military,

482
00:40:38,494 --> 00:40:40,763
the indictment had to go
to his commander first

483
00:40:40,796 --> 00:40:42,898
and they just fucking
transfer him to Sinaloa.

484
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:49,004
Three weeks later,
Emiliana's mother,

485
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:51,073
aunt and three sisters
disappeared.

486
00:40:52,975 --> 00:40:54,944
They hung those women
from a bridge

487
00:40:54,977 --> 00:40:58,013
right in front
of my office window.

488
00:40:58,047 --> 00:40:59,215
Jesus.

489
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:03,118
You should learn the prayer.

490
00:41:28,478 --> 00:41:29,879
Maya: Hey!

491
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:34,217
Shh! Hey!

492
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:37,153
You're okay.

493
00:41:38,154 --> 00:41:39,289
Who are you?

494
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:41,358
I'm Maya.

495
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:42,826
You're at the hotel.

496
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:45,262
- Hotel?
- Yes.

497
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,030
Just had a bad dream.

498
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:49,867
You're okay.

499
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:38,183
That was nice,
maybe next time you're in town...

500
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:40,452
I won't be back.

501
00:42:40,485 --> 00:42:42,120
Alright.

502
00:42:42,154 --> 00:42:45,123
- Good luck then!
- And to you.

503
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:46,525
Woman on TV: A 13-year-old girl

504
00:42:46,558 --> 00:42:48,627
has been murdered
in Sunset Heights.

505
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,128
The minor, Beatriz Leon,

506
00:42:50,162 --> 00:42:52,597
had recently been
relocated to a group home

507
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:54,900
from an El Paso
detention center.

508
00:42:54,933 --> 00:42:57,002
According to an El Paso
police spokesman,

509
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:58,337
the young girl's murder is...

510
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,505
Was I here last night?

511
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:03,141
Yes. What's wrong?

512
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:05,010
Woman on TV: We're getting very
few details...

513
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:07,012
- You sure?
- Yes!

514
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:08,347
- I was here?
- Yes!

515
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,482
- All night?
- Yes! Stop it, you're hurting...

516
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:12,584
- I was here all night?
- Yes.

517
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:15,087
Listen to me. Very carefully.

518
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,488
You have to leave now.

519
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:18,223
You were never here,
we never met.

520
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:20,893
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

521
00:43:20,927 --> 00:43:22,628
I have to go. Right?

522
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:24,630
You stay away
from this hotel for a while.

523
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:25,965
- A long while!
- Okay.

524
00:43:25,998 --> 00:43:28,434
- Do you hear me?
- Yes!

525
00:43:28,468 --> 00:43:31,371
Do not answer that door
for anyone. Anyone!

526
00:43:39,278 --> 00:43:41,247
Woman on TV: Well executed,
it is worth noting

527
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,082
that violence against children,

528
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:44,617
is a calling card of the cartels

529
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,085
across the border.

530
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,955
Called on for comment,
the Mayor had none.

531
00:44:29,163 --> 00:44:30,640
Maya: Hey! You forgot them,
you forgot your pills...

532
00:44:30,664 --> 00:44:32,433
Get back! Get back!

533
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,102
When did you go soft, Alex?

534
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:17,072
They'll end you for this.

535
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:19,308
Happy retirement, Maury!

536
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:24,481
Alex!

537
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,418
Alex!

538
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:43,166
Goodness, you got the
heart of a 35-year-old.

539
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,836
At this rate,
you'll live to be 130.

540
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,606
I'll give you
five million to make it 135.

541
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,279
If you said, "Yes,"
I'd fire you.

542
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,182
You know if I said yes,
I'd want you to.

543
00:46:59,215 --> 00:47:02,887
My grandfather is a Abruzzese.
He lived to be 104.

544
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,123
Yeah? Lucky guy.

545
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,426
You know, that all region,
along the Adriatic,

546
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:12,697
and Okinawa, Japan,
they call those blue zones.

547
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,865
Places that generally have

548
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:15,867
a higher percentage
of centenarians.

549
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:18,402
I'm aware, Joseph. But why?

550
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:21,505
Nutrition? Lack of
pollutants in the air?

551
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:24,442
There is no reason
we have to age, to decay.

552
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:27,311
Some medical professionals
might actually argue that.

553
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,414
Everything can be
reprogrammed, modded.

554
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:32,516
Why shouldn't human health
be the same?

555
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,318
DNA's an algorithm.

556
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,432
Look, I'm not gonna tell you
how to spend your money.

557
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,223
Especially when so much of it

558
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,325
ends up in your pocket.

559
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:59,244
I appreciate you
giving me a call.

560
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:00,823
I don't know what the fuck
is going on in this town.

561
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:03,715
Swear to God, it's getting
more like Afghanistan every day.

562
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:07,753
- Who are they?
- Matched set.

563
00:48:07,787 --> 00:48:09,254
Mora: Jane and Joe Doe.

564
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:10,933
He was in the driver's seat,
blown the fuck up.

565
00:48:10,957 --> 00:48:12,391
She was in the trunk.

566
00:48:12,424 --> 00:48:14,192
.32 caliber bullet to the neck,

567
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:15,661
jacketed with
suppressor markings.

568
00:48:15,694 --> 00:48:18,865
Just like we pulled out
of Beatriz Leon.

569
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:21,400
Car's registered to a
David Marshall.

570
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:22,935
Rented at the airport.

571
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:25,537
Some expat businessman
out of San Diego.

572
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,372
Probably the corpse in the car.

573
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:29,341
We're running teeth
on them both.

574
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:30,718
Okay, this guy is drunk
as a skunk.

575
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,412
He, uh, pulled a .24
three times over the limit.

576
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:35,289
So I need you to sign off
on the report before you go.

577
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:36,784
Mora: You got it.

578
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,954
- What's that?
- Found them on the floor.

579
00:48:40,988 --> 00:48:43,222
It didn't match anything
on our database,

580
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:45,959
so the lab is running chem-test.

581
00:48:45,993 --> 00:48:47,469
If that's a prescription,
it might help...

582
00:48:47,493 --> 00:48:49,362
The lab's on it,
we might not be fancy,

583
00:48:49,395 --> 00:48:50,898
Vincent, but we ain't dumb.

584
00:48:52,465 --> 00:48:53,977
I'll run the Marshall name
through VICAP,

585
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:55,368
see if anything comes up.

586
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:56,679
I'll hit you up
with the ballistics

587
00:48:56,703 --> 00:48:59,205
as soon as they come back.
Same with the pill.

588
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:03,409
Hey!

589
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:07,213
Sorry about the girl, man.
It was fucked up.

590
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,996
I couldn't go back.

591
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,665
They don't love you
in Mexico anymore?

592
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,870
You're not asking for
my permission to stay, are you?

593
00:49:28,903 --> 00:49:32,372
- Linda said I had to.
- Oh, well, in that case...

594
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:35,476
Come on, you know
what she's like.

595
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:36,710
Yeah.

596
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:39,848
Nobody gives a fuck about
that girl, Vincent.

597
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:42,483
Except you, me and Linda.

598
00:49:44,518 --> 00:49:47,789
I can do things
you and her can't. You know?

599
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:49,958
As a concerned citizen.

600
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:52,026
From Mexico?

601
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,461
Okay, concerned Mexican citizen.

602
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:55,997
With questionable investigative

603
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,531
authority in the United States.

604
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,035
Yeah, Nussbaum is
really gonna go for that.

605
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:04,338
Fuck Nussbaum.
I don't work for him.

606
00:52:18,776 --> 00:52:20,610
Ellis: Look, I promise
you I had no reason

607
00:52:20,644 --> 00:52:22,981
to say anything unless
you give me one.

608
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:26,651
Sealman: What you're doing right
now is incredibly stupid, Ellis.

609
00:52:26,684 --> 00:52:28,053
I hope you understand that.

610
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:32,157
Ellis: You've left me no choice.
I won't be cut out.

611
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,758
Look, this doesn't
have to be ugly.

612
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:35,593
Sealman: Blackmail
is already ugly.

613
00:52:35,626 --> 00:52:38,063
Ellis: Look, all...
Sealman: Mr. Van Camp!

614
00:52:38,096 --> 00:52:39,730
Sealman: We are not negotiating.

615
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:42,968
You've crossed a line
from which there is no return.

616
00:54:09,823 --> 00:54:12,292
Looks like another .32 caliber.

617
00:54:12,326 --> 00:54:14,328
And I'm guessing
it's also gonna be jacketed

618
00:54:14,361 --> 00:54:16,163
with suppressor markings.

619
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:17,931
I'm gonna go talk to the wife.

620
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:20,633
See you there.

621
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:22,236
Do you think he's right?

622
00:54:22,269 --> 00:54:23,904
I'd put money on it.

623
00:54:23,937 --> 00:54:25,806
This is a problem, no question.

624
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,776
Maybe a hitter
cleaning up some shit.

625
00:54:32,813 --> 00:54:35,783
I'll catch you guys later.

626
00:54:35,816 --> 00:54:37,151
Good idea.

627
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:44,301
Nussbaum:
Last time I checked, Serra,

628
00:54:44,325 --> 00:54:45,994
you were working the
Van Camp murder.

629
00:54:46,027 --> 00:54:47,996
Last time I checked, sir,
I work for the FBI.

630
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:49,730
Was that Hugo Marquez
I just saw?

631
00:54:49,763 --> 00:54:52,633
Listen... I think
there's a connection

632
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:54,735
between Beatriz Leon,
the Jane Doe found

633
00:54:54,768 --> 00:54:57,114
in the trunk of the car downtown
and this guy, William Borden.

634
00:54:57,138 --> 00:54:59,673
If this does turn out
to be a jacket of .32,

635
00:54:59,706 --> 00:55:01,684
that's three people likely
killed with the same weapon.

636
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:04,079
Look, I get it, the girl.
She's under your skin.

637
00:55:04,112 --> 00:55:05,222
Maybe you're a little obsessed...

638
00:55:05,246 --> 00:55:06,347
I'm just doing my job.

639
00:55:06,381 --> 00:55:08,983
Hugo thinks it's a pro,
settling scores.

640
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:12,220
We think it could be a
hitter from across the fence.

641
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:13,822
But you can't be sure.

642
00:55:13,855 --> 00:55:15,990
We can't, but if the
ballistics match, and there

643
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:17,968
really is a Mexican killer
tearing ass through town,

644
00:55:17,992 --> 00:55:19,660
we might want to get
ahead of that.

645
00:55:19,693 --> 00:55:21,796
And we're gonna need Marquez.

646
00:55:23,665 --> 00:55:26,368
Alright, do what you have to do.

647
00:55:26,402 --> 00:55:28,237
But I want updates twice a day.

648
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,805
Vincent: Yeah.

649
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,944
Lab just came back
on those pills.

650
00:55:34,977 --> 00:55:36,045
Diffadyl.

651
00:55:36,078 --> 00:55:39,849
Alzheimer's drug. Your
shooter is loosing his shit.

652
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:42,818
- Okay. Is the wife inside?
- Yeah.

653
00:55:42,852 --> 00:55:44,262
Keep your hands away
from the cage on that one.

654
00:55:44,286 --> 00:55:47,356
I don't know if it's medicine
or just plain crazy.

655
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:49,825
- Wanna sit in on this?
- Sure.

656
00:55:57,299 --> 00:56:02,171
Mrs. Borden, I'm Agent Serra.
This is Detective Marquez.

657
00:56:02,204 --> 00:56:04,140
I'm sorry for what's happened.

658
00:56:04,173 --> 00:56:06,342
Borden: Part of life, right?

659
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,177
It's what they say...

660
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:12,115
Hasn't really sunk in.

661
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:15,919
Hmm, FBI. Fancy.

662
00:56:15,952 --> 00:56:18,754
- You an agent, too?
- Liaison from Mexico.

663
00:56:18,788 --> 00:56:20,756
What's Mexico have to do
with William?

664
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,125
He hated the place.

665
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:25,428
Well, that's what
we're... hoping to find out.

666
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:27,397
Have you noticed
anything unusual

667
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,132
happen in the past few weeks,

668
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:32,735
where your husband's behavior
has changed at all?

669
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:36,373
Will's behavior
hasn't changed in 20 years.

670
00:56:36,406 --> 00:56:39,042
No. Nothing.

671
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:41,444
- What kind of law did he do?
- Real Estate.

672
00:56:41,478 --> 00:56:43,847
Marquez: Sorry to ask
this, Mrs. Borden.

673
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,315
But do you know
if your husband had

674
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:46,917
any ties to prostitution?

675
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:50,086
I have no idea. Sit down.

676
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:54,325
Bill paying for it?

677
00:56:54,358 --> 00:56:56,794
Doesn't seem like him.

678
00:56:56,827 --> 00:56:59,063
Did your husband know
Ellis Van Camp?

679
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:03,100
I know Wendy.
I see her at the same events.

680
00:57:03,134 --> 00:57:07,205
It's all one big
cocktail party up here.

681
00:57:07,238 --> 00:57:10,141
You like cocktails, Detective?

682
00:57:10,174 --> 00:57:13,978
Margaritas? Pina Coladas?

683
00:57:15,513 --> 00:57:17,782
Vincent: Thanks for your help,
Mrs. Borden.

684
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:20,184
If you need anything,
just give us a call.

685
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:29,269
I'm afraid
she can't be disturbed...

686
00:57:29,293 --> 00:57:31,062
Don't even fucking start.

687
00:57:32,129 --> 00:57:33,798
I've been calling you
all morning.

688
00:57:33,831 --> 00:57:36,500
Borden's dead.
Someone executed him.

689
00:57:36,534 --> 00:57:39,770
And if he got to Borden,
then he's close.

690
00:57:39,805 --> 00:57:41,240
Jesus, mum...

691
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,849
Just take a breath.

692
00:57:52,551 --> 00:57:53,952
<i>Bravo.</i>

693
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:58,857
You need to leave El Paso.
Immediately.

694
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,259
Take the company plane.

695
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:02,070
What about tomorrow night,
it's all been arranged...

696
00:58:02,094 --> 00:58:04,096
Listen to me.

697
00:58:04,129 --> 00:58:07,966
Tomorrow, after the party,
you'll fly to Geneva.

698
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,502
Stay at the house
and make arrangements

699
00:58:10,535 --> 00:58:12,204
for you to check
into rehab there.

700
00:58:12,237 --> 00:58:13,405
Rehab?

701
00:58:13,438 --> 00:58:15,073
If things connect to you,

702
00:58:15,107 --> 00:58:17,542
and we have a problem,
you will be working

703
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:20,145
on your issues,
which will buy us time

704
00:58:20,178 --> 00:58:23,882
to quietly hire
very good lawyers.

705
00:58:23,915 --> 00:58:27,387
Besides... you need help, Randy.

706
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,391
I'm sorry.

707
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,294
I'm so sorry.

708
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:36,863
Sealman: I know you are, baby.

709
00:58:36,896 --> 00:58:39,032
I know you are.

710
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,203
Full ballistics came back.

711
00:58:44,237 --> 00:58:47,073
Same gun killed Beatriz
and the Jane Doe in the car,

712
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:51,044
but not Borden.
Two .32s, two shooters.

713
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:52,512
Trafficking, Vincent Serra.

714
00:58:52,545 --> 00:58:55,448
Alex: You're the one who took
the girl to the group home.

715
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:57,917
- Weren't you?
- Who is this?

716
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,386
Alex: Marshall. David Marshall.

717
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,255
Tap and trace.

718
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:05,325
Ah, David Marshall
burned up a car downtown.

719
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:06,526
Is that your doing?

720
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,295
Alex: I can't keep doing
your job for you.

721
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:10,397
Vincent: What job is that?

722
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:13,600
Alex: Borden, Van Camp.
What they did to children.

723
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,336
You're not doing
anything about it.

724
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:17,471
Are you saying
you killed William Borden?

725
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:21,141
And Ellis Van Camp? Alex: Yes.

726
00:59:21,175 --> 00:59:24,478
And what about the girl?
Beatriz Leon.

727
00:59:24,511 --> 00:59:26,880
Not the girl. That was Mauricio.

728
00:59:26,914 --> 00:59:29,083
The man in the car.

729
00:59:29,116 --> 00:59:32,953
You're too slow to make
them pay. They're too rich.

730
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:37,291
- Who's too rich?
- Alex: The lawyer, the client.

731
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,892
Who's the client?

732
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:43,897
- Alex: Did you know her?
- Who?

733
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:48,235
The... the... the girl.
B... Beatriz.

734
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:51,372
A little. Alex: Did you care?

735
00:59:51,405 --> 00:59:53,240
Fifteen seconds.

736
00:59:53,273 --> 00:59:54,908
I certainly did.

737
00:59:54,942 --> 00:59:57,946
I want to believe that you
are a good man, Vincent.

738
00:59:57,979 --> 01:00:01,049
I'm the bad man.
Have been for a long time.

739
01:00:01,082 --> 01:00:02,650
But they have to be punished.

740
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:04,919
Alex: If I can't finish this...

741
01:00:04,953 --> 01:00:06,921
you have to.

742
01:00:10,425 --> 01:00:12,327
He's downstairs in the park.

743
01:00:22,437 --> 01:00:24,272
Woman 1: Hey, move!

744
01:00:24,305 --> 01:00:25,673
What is this?

745
01:00:30,345 --> 01:00:32,981
He's fucking with us.

746
01:00:33,014 --> 01:00:35,049
He's just telling us
we're way too slow.

747
01:00:36,151 --> 01:00:37,561
We've got an asshole
exploiting a kid

748
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:40,188
and how long is it taking us
to bring him to trial?

749
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:42,191
Two to three years, right?

750
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:53,135
He said they're too rich.

751
01:00:53,169 --> 01:00:55,013
Now, we've been getting
push back on the trafficking

752
01:00:55,037 --> 01:00:56,705
every step of the way.

753
01:00:56,739 --> 01:00:58,974
No, I think
he's, he's taking out

754
01:00:59,008 --> 01:01:02,011
the traffickers
that we couldn't.

755
01:01:02,044 --> 01:01:03,612
Leaving us breadcrumbs.

756
01:01:03,646 --> 01:01:06,048
Proving a point.

757
01:01:21,764 --> 01:01:25,468
Well... Detective Marquez.

758
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:27,204
How long were you watching me?

759
01:01:27,237 --> 01:01:29,172
Hugo: I just got here,
Mrs. Borden.

760
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:31,208
You shouldn't leave
the gate open.

761
01:01:31,241 --> 01:01:33,710
Whatever will be will be.

762
01:01:33,743 --> 01:01:36,146
And if you're
watching over me...

763
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:38,482
nothing to worry about, right?

764
01:01:38,515 --> 01:01:40,484
You're a strong swimmer.

765
01:01:40,517 --> 01:01:42,452
I'm out of shape.

766
01:01:54,331 --> 01:01:57,634
I was an alternate
for the '92 Olympic team.

767
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:01,204
I was 17. Best time of my life.

768
01:02:01,238 --> 01:02:03,707
By '96, I'd lost a second.

769
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,209
That was it.

770
01:02:06,243 --> 01:02:07,711
Done.

771
01:02:07,744 --> 01:02:09,212
So instead of a Wheaties Box

772
01:02:09,246 --> 01:02:11,482
and a dashing husband in LA,

773
01:02:11,516 --> 01:02:13,484
I ended up here.

774
01:02:13,518 --> 01:02:15,787
In Texas.

775
01:02:15,821 --> 01:02:17,388
Could you pass me that glass?

776
01:02:18,756 --> 01:02:20,258
Hugo: Sure.

777
01:02:25,797 --> 01:02:27,498
So, what do you want, Detective?

778
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,803
Well...

779
01:02:31,837 --> 01:02:34,305
I'm not here to clean your pool.

780
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:37,174
You are not a real
cop here, are you?

781
01:02:38,676 --> 01:02:39,811
That's why I'm here.

782
01:02:39,845 --> 01:02:42,480
What? To not arrest me?

783
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:44,282
Have you ever heard your
husband talk about

784
01:02:44,315 --> 01:02:45,817
a man named David Marshall?

785
01:02:45,851 --> 01:02:50,154
You didn't come here
to ask me questions.

786
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:52,456
I didn't come here
for that either.

787
01:02:54,258 --> 01:02:56,695
I stayed out of
William's business.

788
01:02:56,728 --> 01:02:58,430
Wives know.

789
01:02:59,731 --> 01:03:01,567
I never knew the name,

790
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,135
but I heard him on the phone.

791
01:03:03,168 --> 01:03:06,305
He was nervous.
He didn't want me to hear.

792
01:03:06,338 --> 01:03:09,842
He was talking about a man
from Mexico City.

793
01:03:09,876 --> 01:03:11,476
Why didn't you say
something before?

794
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:14,446
Because of who
he was talking to.

795
01:03:14,479 --> 01:03:16,181
Davana Sealman.

796
01:03:16,214 --> 01:03:18,717
That's why I didn't
say anything.

797
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,352
He was being used.

798
01:03:20,385 --> 01:03:21,653
How?

799
01:03:21,687 --> 01:03:23,488
You should go.

800
01:03:25,892 --> 01:03:27,492
Thank you, <i>Senora</i> Borden.

801
01:03:27,526 --> 01:03:30,329
Don't ever come back,
Detective Marquez.

802
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:36,168
Davana Sealman? You sure?

803
01:03:36,201 --> 01:03:37,870
That's the name she said.

804
01:03:37,904 --> 01:03:40,205
Borden was probably one
of her attorneys.

805
01:03:40,238 --> 01:03:42,175
Nope, Borden's name isn't listed

806
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:43,610
on any of the filings
for Sea Corp

807
01:03:43,643 --> 01:03:45,445
or Davana Sealman personally.

808
01:03:45,478 --> 01:03:47,881
You realize we're talking
about one of the most powerful

809
01:03:47,915 --> 01:03:49,616
real estate moguls
in the country, right?

810
01:03:49,649 --> 01:03:50,884
Vincent: Yeah. Yeah.

811
01:03:50,918 --> 01:03:52,761
I know, but Borden spoke
to Sealman on the phone

812
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:54,354
about the
"Man from Mexico City."

813
01:03:54,387 --> 01:03:58,157
Oh, you got proof?
Well, did you bang her at least?

814
01:03:58,191 --> 01:03:59,735
I mean, if you're gonna take
the word of a half-drunk

815
01:03:59,759 --> 01:04:02,896
trophy wife, you may as well get
something out of it, right?

816
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:05,365
- Did she elaborate?
- What?

817
01:04:05,398 --> 01:04:06,766
On the "Man from Mexico City."

818
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,368
Shut up, hold on!

819
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:11,137
Borden wasn't one of
Davana Sealman's lawyers.

820
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:14,240
He was one of Randy
Sealman's lawyers.

821
01:04:14,273 --> 01:04:16,376
Davana's son.

822
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:19,679
Apparently, Randy's also
a real estate mogul.

823
01:04:19,712 --> 01:04:21,581
Oh, fuck.

824
01:04:21,614 --> 01:04:25,886
Randy Sealman's company owns the
Central Processing facility.

825
01:04:25,919 --> 01:04:27,354
Where they sent Beatriz.

826
01:04:27,388 --> 01:04:29,356
Hey, in case
you haven't noticed,

827
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:30,792
they send a lot of people there.

828
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,927
Oh, yeah, I know.

829
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:35,229
But she's 13.

830
01:04:35,262 --> 01:04:37,531
Imagine how vulnerable
you feel at that age

831
01:04:37,564 --> 01:04:39,233
in an ICE center.

832
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:42,436
Okay, let's take a look.

833
01:04:44,405 --> 01:04:46,240
Okay. Well, it's not her
first time there.

834
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:47,584
She was there last year
for three weeks

835
01:04:47,608 --> 01:04:49,376
with her father,
and then they were deported.

836
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:53,714
It gets stickier. Ellis
Van Camp was CPF's builder.

837
01:04:53,747 --> 01:04:56,417
So everyone associated
with this Processing Centre,

838
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:57,952
the lawyer, the builder,

839
01:04:57,986 --> 01:05:00,654
Beatriz, all dead.

840
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:04,291
He's going to kill
Randy Sealman.

841
01:06:14,064 --> 01:06:15,631
Drinking on duty?

842
01:06:15,664 --> 01:06:18,768
This is so far away
from official.

843
01:06:18,802 --> 01:06:20,402
So this guy,

844
01:06:20,436 --> 01:06:22,338
he owns the detention center.

845
01:06:22,371 --> 01:06:24,340
And you're wondering why
we're protecting him?

846
01:06:24,373 --> 01:06:26,509
I don't wonder why at all.

847
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,655
Linda: Amistead?

848
01:06:39,688 --> 01:06:41,524
Randy is on the lower deck,
moving inside.

849
01:06:41,557 --> 01:06:44,796
- Linda: On my way.
- Hugo, keep eyes on deck.

850
01:06:44,829 --> 01:06:47,697
Hugo: Got it.

851
01:06:50,467 --> 01:06:51,869
Target's on the boat!

852
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:08,652
Take that shit off.

853
01:07:16,093 --> 01:07:18,863
When I leave, lock the door.

854
01:07:18,896 --> 01:07:21,698
Okay? Good girl.

855
01:07:30,775 --> 01:07:32,410
Alex: You scum.

856
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:27,800
Alex: Put it down.

857
01:08:33,006 --> 01:08:34,640
Alex: Attaboy.

858
01:08:37,643 --> 01:08:40,046
You're Vincent, aren't you?

859
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:41,513
I am.

860
01:08:41,546 --> 01:08:43,749
I'm Alex. Alex Lewis.

861
01:08:45,118 --> 01:08:47,987
You know what those people did
to that child, right?

862
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:49,923
Only too well.

863
01:08:49,956 --> 01:08:52,225
Alex: I've done crazy things.

864
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:54,493
But you don't hurt
children, ever.

865
01:08:54,526 --> 01:08:56,495
Listen, why don't you
and I just...

866
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:58,631
- Just have a talk?
- No time for that.

867
01:08:58,665 --> 01:09:00,076
Vincent: I understand
why you're saying that.

868
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,936
I know you're not well.

869
01:09:01,969 --> 01:09:03,536
We all have to die, Vincent.

870
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:05,148
What's important is what you
do before you go...

871
01:09:05,172 --> 01:09:07,549
- Vincent! Put your gun down!
- Get outta here get outta here!

872
01:09:07,573 --> 01:09:09,209
- Is your friend a good shot?
- Very.

873
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:10,954
- Then it's in your hands.
- Hugo: Don't move!

874
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:13,213
Put the fucking gun down!

875
01:09:13,247 --> 01:09:16,817
If I'm dead,
she'll never know the truth.

876
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:18,819
Put the gun down.

877
01:09:37,404 --> 01:09:40,841
- Vincent: Hey, hey, hey!
- What the fuck are you doing?

878
01:09:40,874 --> 01:09:42,209
I've got it!

879
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:04,093
You know, I quit drinking
15 years ago.

880
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:06,095
But right now, I can
actually taste the scotch

881
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,197
in the back of my throat.

882
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,697
Davana Sealman's only son

883
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:12,168
was just murdered on my watch.

884
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,670
She's not happy with us.

885
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,007
The lady has even hired
off-duty cops for protection.

886
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,674
He was way ahead of us.

887
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:20,353
He was probably on that boat
before the party even began.

888
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:22,279
Who is this fucking guy, Vince?

889
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:24,281
Vincent: Alex Lewis.

890
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:26,649
Well, I can tell you
he's American.

891
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:28,684
He's no doubt a contractor,
but...

892
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:31,321
I don't think
these have all been hits.

893
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,656
He wants revenge
for Beatriz Leon.

894
01:12:16,267 --> 01:12:17,869
Sir, you alright?

895
01:12:23,307 --> 01:12:25,775
Have you been
drinking tonight, sir?

896
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:28,379
Paul...

897
01:12:28,412 --> 01:12:31,182
Paul with his sons.

898
01:12:43,227 --> 01:12:44,662
Jesus.

899
01:15:01,903 --> 01:15:05,040
Motorcycle patrolman Eric Lyle.

900
01:15:05,073 --> 01:15:07,042
Must have found Alex wounded.

901
01:15:07,075 --> 01:15:09,077
There was blood
all over the Bronco.

902
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:11,880
I don't know.
Maybe he got spooked.

903
01:15:11,913 --> 01:15:13,315
That's not his style.

904
01:15:13,348 --> 01:15:14,582
His style is murder, Vincent.

905
01:15:14,616 --> 01:15:16,885
No, we need to find him
before the El Paso PD.

906
01:15:16,918 --> 01:15:18,129
They're not going
to be happy about this.

907
01:15:18,153 --> 01:15:21,456
Well, we know something
they don't.

908
01:15:21,489 --> 01:15:24,459
I think I know
who Alex Lewis is.

909
01:15:24,492 --> 01:15:25,960
Linda: I ran juvenile records.

910
01:15:25,994 --> 01:15:28,363
Vandalism, auto-theft, assault.

911
01:15:28,396 --> 01:15:29,998
Well, it could be him.

912
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:33,201
Only problem is,
Alex Lewis is dead.

913
01:15:33,234 --> 01:15:35,437
He and his father died in the
fire at the family bakery

914
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:36,938
forty years ago.

915
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:39,974
Investigators thought
Alex set the fire.

916
01:15:40,008 --> 01:15:41,476
Brother's still in town though.

917
01:15:41,509 --> 01:15:43,878
Care facility on the parkway.

918
01:15:43,912 --> 01:15:45,948
Advanced Alzheimer's.

919
01:15:45,981 --> 01:15:48,017
Man's a vegetable.

920
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:50,086
I also came up
with medical records.

921
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:52,288
Alex and his brother
were well known at the ER.

922
01:15:52,321 --> 01:15:55,925
Always a "fall down the stairs"
or an "accidental burn."

923
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:58,361
Other things
were harder to hide.

924
01:15:58,394 --> 01:16:00,463
Father was never charged
with the abuse.

925
01:16:00,496 --> 01:16:02,598
Sexual or physical.

926
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:04,367
Want me to warrant the bakery?

927
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,468
Definitely.

928
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,628
This guy from Mexico City,

929
01:17:37,662 --> 01:17:40,465
the one Borden was talking to
Davana Sealman about.

930
01:17:40,498 --> 01:17:43,267
What if she hired him?

931
01:17:43,301 --> 01:17:44,741
'Cause I'm thinking
if Alex is not up

932
01:17:44,769 --> 01:17:47,171
to killing Sealman himself,

933
01:17:47,205 --> 01:17:48,739
he wants us to bring her in.

934
01:17:48,773 --> 01:17:50,575
Catch is, the only person
who can connect.

935
01:17:50,608 --> 01:17:51,676
Sealman to any of this...

936
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,211
Is Alex.

937
01:17:53,244 --> 01:17:55,746
She's harder to get
to than any of the others.

938
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,749
He reached out to you
to cover his bets.

939
01:17:58,783 --> 01:18:00,485
The only address
from Paul and Alex's

940
01:18:00,518 --> 01:18:01,753
medical records is the bakery.

941
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:04,156
Oh, forget about it,
that place is a wreck.

942
01:18:04,189 --> 01:18:06,191
Unless you're looking
for a pigeon.

943
01:18:07,392 --> 01:18:08,794
What did you say?

944
01:18:08,828 --> 01:18:11,029
Pigeons.

945
01:18:11,063 --> 01:18:13,365
<i>Palomas.</i>
The place is full of them.

946
01:18:13,398 --> 01:18:15,234
The lab report on the Bronco...

947
01:18:15,267 --> 01:18:17,369
the one where the
patrolman got killed,

948
01:18:17,402 --> 01:18:19,538
the floor had traces
of pigeon shit on it.

949
01:19:33,347 --> 01:19:35,349
Mora: Anything I can get you?

950
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:39,854
What?

951
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:41,890
Anything you need?

952
01:19:41,923 --> 01:19:43,657
No, thank you.

953
01:20:01,508 --> 01:20:04,678
Top of the hour, boys. Check in.

954
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:52,293
Boss!

955
01:20:56,765 --> 01:20:58,767
Let him up.

956
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,735
Get him a new battery.

957
01:21:13,016 --> 01:21:15,251
- Put them down!
- Now!

958
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:24,660
You! Get back!

959
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:41,444
Stay in here. Don't open
that door to anybody.

960
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:45,849
Boys! Main office.
Live shooter! Live shooter!

961
01:22:32,931 --> 01:22:35,033
He's headed for the roof.

962
01:22:54,953 --> 01:22:56,387
Mora.

963
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,722
Mora, he's on the roof.

964
01:22:57,755 --> 01:23:00,391
Copy. If you get the chance,
put him down.

965
01:23:01,692 --> 01:23:03,294
Copy that.

966
01:23:06,832 --> 01:23:08,934
It's all over.

967
01:23:08,967 --> 01:23:11,536
Let's get you out of here.

968
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:42,601
You killed my son.

969
01:23:42,634 --> 01:23:43,702
Yes.

970
01:23:46,005 --> 01:23:47,941
And I know what you've done.

971
01:24:18,671 --> 01:24:20,373
Firing pin.

972
01:24:26,646 --> 01:24:29,884
You know why I didn't just
off you back there?

973
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:36,789
Let me tell you why.

974
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:44,832
That would have been mercy.

975
01:24:44,865 --> 01:24:47,001
No. I want to see you
go to Yuma.

976
01:24:47,034 --> 01:24:49,971
Where I will make sure they
fuck you to death, old man.

977
01:24:50,005 --> 01:24:52,506
You cop-killing piece of shit.

978
01:24:57,678 --> 01:24:59,680
How about that little girl?

979
01:24:59,713 --> 01:25:02,583
You know what they do to
people who hurt kids?

980
01:25:02,616 --> 01:25:07,755
I'll talk to FBI Agent
V... V... Vincent Serra.

981
01:25:08,957 --> 01:25:10,158
No one else.

982
01:25:13,494 --> 01:25:15,096
Fuck the feds.

983
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:16,764
We got you on
three counts of murder.

984
01:25:16,797 --> 01:25:19,067
Your busted fucking gun
matches Borden

985
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,567
and Officer Eric Lyle.

986
01:25:20,601 --> 01:25:22,070
Guy had a wife and two kids...

987
01:25:22,103 --> 01:25:25,706
Danny! He needs a doctor.

988
01:25:29,878 --> 01:25:31,545
No, he doesn't.

989
01:25:31,578 --> 01:25:33,815
I've got all day, and
by the end, I swear to God,

990
01:25:33,848 --> 01:25:36,651
I'll have me a
written confession.

991
01:25:38,988 --> 01:25:41,157
If he went after Sealman
with a broken gun,

992
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:42,892
we'd have heard something.

993
01:25:42,925 --> 01:25:44,769
I just think he's at the end.
He ain't remembering things.

994
01:25:44,793 --> 01:25:47,163
And also, PPD has gone
totally silent.

995
01:25:47,196 --> 01:25:49,832
And this came from the
bakery address.

996
01:25:49,865 --> 01:25:51,267
What is it?

997
01:26:11,619 --> 01:26:14,723
Jesus. Where did you get this?

998
01:26:14,756 --> 01:26:16,225
Vincent: It doesn't matter.

999
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:18,060
El Paso PD are holding
Alex Lewis

1000
01:26:18,094 --> 01:26:20,230
and I need you to transfer him
into our custody.

1001
01:26:20,263 --> 01:26:22,099
Let him be their problem.

1002
01:26:24,835 --> 01:26:26,903
Which side of this do you
really want to be on?

1003
01:26:28,571 --> 01:26:30,806
I need to talk to him.

1004
01:26:30,841 --> 01:26:32,608
But it seems
very powerful people

1005
01:26:32,641 --> 01:26:34,978
don't want that to happen.

1006
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:08,779
What the fuck did you do to him?

1007
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:11,315
- He resisted arrest.
- So you had to bust him up?

1008
01:27:11,349 --> 01:27:12,884
He's a cop killer
for fuck's sake.

1009
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:15,086
You like being on
Davana Sealman's payroll?

1010
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:16,888
Hey!

1011
01:27:16,921 --> 01:27:18,622
Cool off!

1012
01:27:30,168 --> 01:27:31,836
Well, well.

1013
01:27:33,971 --> 01:27:35,772
The FBI.

1014
01:27:36,974 --> 01:27:37,975
Huh.

1015
01:27:39,143 --> 01:27:40,945
You are the one that shot me.

1016
01:27:40,978 --> 01:27:43,680
I'm not going to offer
an apology.

1017
01:27:43,713 --> 01:27:45,850
I'm not asking for one.

1018
01:27:51,857 --> 01:27:53,158
Thank you.

1019
01:28:04,702 --> 01:28:07,072
These aren't going to help
for much longer.

1020
01:28:10,008 --> 01:28:12,311
I understand you want
to clear this up.

1021
01:28:12,344 --> 01:28:13,879
Alex: Clear this up?

1022
01:28:13,912 --> 01:28:15,214
No.

1023
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:16,949
I want Sealman dead.

1024
01:28:16,982 --> 01:28:19,151
Well, she's not officially
tied to any crime.

1025
01:28:19,184 --> 01:28:21,120
You know that's not true.

1026
01:28:21,153 --> 01:28:22,988
She sanctioned the hit.

1027
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:25,991
She hired me to kill...
two people.

1028
01:28:26,024 --> 01:28:29,895
Ellis Van Camp and
the second was that child.

1029
01:28:29,928 --> 01:28:32,998
Girl of thirteen.
Be... Be... Beatriz.

1030
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:36,236
I won't do that.

1031
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:37,769
Vincent: No.

1032
01:28:38,737 --> 01:28:40,874
No. You don't touch children.

1033
01:28:42,774 --> 01:28:45,711
Dr. Myers: Okay, press down.
Sealman: Thank you.

1034
01:28:45,744 --> 01:28:48,281
I really appreciate you
being here for me.

1035
01:28:48,314 --> 01:28:50,250
During all this.

1036
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:52,452
You're not just a client,
you know.

1037
01:28:52,485 --> 01:28:54,854
Is that true, Joseph?

1038
01:28:54,888 --> 01:28:57,457
You know, the hardest thing
is never really trusting

1039
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:59,459
those people close to you.

1040
01:28:59,492 --> 01:29:01,027
Besides Randy...

1041
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:04,297
I will never really
know why someone is with me.

1042
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:07,367
Come on.
I'm your friend, Davana.

1043
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,202
I'm here for you.

1044
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:19,145
The retainer for your services
is $10 million.

1045
01:29:21,515 --> 01:29:23,884
I can't.

1046
01:29:23,918 --> 01:29:26,719
Do you realize what
you're asking me to do?

1047
01:29:26,753 --> 01:29:28,455
I'm sorry. No.

1048
01:29:28,489 --> 01:29:31,058
- I took an oath.
- An oath?

1049
01:29:31,091 --> 01:29:32,826
Like a marriage vow?

1050
01:29:34,228 --> 01:29:36,796
You were at Randy's parties.

1051
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,731
You think I didn't know?

1052
01:29:38,765 --> 01:29:40,935
So, let's make this simple.

1053
01:29:40,968 --> 01:29:43,736
$10 million or prosecution

1054
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,506
and prison for sex with minors.

1055
01:29:45,539 --> 01:29:46,874
Davana...

1056
01:29:46,907 --> 01:29:48,475
You need to understand
something.

1057
01:29:48,509 --> 01:29:50,144
Randy was weak.

1058
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:52,213
But he was my son.

1059
01:29:52,246 --> 01:29:54,248
You are not.

1060
01:29:56,116 --> 01:30:01,088
Vincent: Murder for hire.
Murder for revenge. Child abuse.

1061
01:30:01,121 --> 01:30:03,123
It's all here.

1062
01:30:03,157 --> 01:30:04,525
It's not over.

1063
01:30:04,558 --> 01:30:06,228
Everybody's dead, Alex.

1064
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:12,000
Even if you do make it to trial,
you get life, my friend,

1065
01:30:12,033 --> 01:30:13,969
which from what
the doctors tell me

1066
01:30:14,002 --> 01:30:15,870
is maybe three to six months.

1067
01:30:16,905 --> 01:30:18,240
So, what are we doing here?

1068
01:30:18,273 --> 01:30:22,143
- Why are we here?
- Alex: Davana Sealman.

1069
01:30:22,177 --> 01:30:23,511
Justice.

1070
01:30:23,545 --> 01:30:25,847
Justice?

1071
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,351
- Are you kidding me?
- I'll testify to all that...

1072
01:30:29,384 --> 01:30:31,052
You're a contract killer.

1073
01:30:31,086 --> 01:30:33,388
You think your testimony's
going to stand up in court?

1074
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:37,058
- She hired me to kill a child.
- Did you get that in writing?

1075
01:30:37,092 --> 01:30:38,560
We're gonna need that evidence.

1076
01:30:42,564 --> 01:30:45,267
You really expect
we're gonna find justice?

1077
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,168
I expect you to try.

1078
01:30:49,037 --> 01:30:50,873
Listen...

1079
01:30:50,906 --> 01:30:52,408
Let me tell you something...

1080
01:30:52,441 --> 01:30:54,243
about justice.

1081
01:30:54,277 --> 01:30:55,945
Twelve months ago,

1082
01:30:55,978 --> 01:30:58,813
a drunk driver
was flying down the I-8

1083
01:30:58,848 --> 01:30:59,882
in a stolen car.

1084
01:30:59,915 --> 01:31:00,883
He's high on meth.

1085
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:03,152
He hasn't seen another car

1086
01:31:03,185 --> 01:31:04,529
that's pulled over
on the shoulder.

1087
01:31:04,553 --> 01:31:06,188
A mom and her ten-year-old son.

1088
01:31:06,222 --> 01:31:08,991
Coming home from Legoland.
They got a flat tire.

1089
01:31:09,025 --> 01:31:10,535
But Colvey, he doesn't
see that the woman

1090
01:31:10,559 --> 01:31:12,295
is out there changing the tire.

1091
01:31:12,328 --> 01:31:15,197
He just plows right into her.
Kills her.

1092
01:31:15,231 --> 01:31:16,966
Now, he stops his car

1093
01:31:16,999 --> 01:31:19,302
and he sees behind him
the boy's jumped out.

1094
01:31:19,335 --> 01:31:20,903
He's obviously screaming.

1095
01:31:20,936 --> 01:31:24,407
Seeing his mom, dead
on the road, crying for help.

1096
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,275
But Colvey doesn't help.

1097
01:31:26,309 --> 01:31:29,578
He puts his car in reverse
and backs over the boy.

1098
01:31:29,612 --> 01:31:32,315
Making sure
there's no witnesses.

1099
01:31:32,348 --> 01:31:35,117
Then he torches his car
two miles down the road.

1100
01:31:35,151 --> 01:31:37,421
But a 15-year-old girl,
she sees him.

1101
01:31:37,454 --> 01:31:41,124
She sees a man walking away
from a big fire with a gas can.

1102
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:42,526
Now, it ain't much,
but it's enough

1103
01:31:42,559 --> 01:31:44,528
to put Colvey on trial.

1104
01:31:44,561 --> 01:31:46,430
You know what happened?

1105
01:31:46,463 --> 01:31:47,998
They do a photo line-up.

1106
01:31:48,031 --> 01:31:50,467
But the girl,
she doesn't pick Colvey.

1107
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:51,868
So they do an in-person,

1108
01:31:51,902 --> 01:31:53,603
and again
she doesn't pick Colvey,

1109
01:31:53,637 --> 01:31:56,340
even though everybody
knows it's him.

1110
01:31:56,373 --> 01:31:57,941
Three times, three line-ups.

1111
01:31:57,974 --> 01:32:00,210
Each time she picks
a different guy.

1112
01:32:00,243 --> 01:32:02,079
And Colvey walks.

1113
01:32:02,112 --> 01:32:04,014
And he's still out there.

1114
01:32:05,649 --> 01:32:07,217
So...

1115
01:32:08,485 --> 01:32:10,954
memory's a motherfucker.

1116
01:32:10,987 --> 01:32:12,456
And as for justice...

1117
01:32:16,493 --> 01:32:18,395
It ain't guaranteed.

1118
01:32:21,131 --> 01:32:23,000
Your wife.

1119
01:32:27,138 --> 01:32:28,406
Your son.

1120
01:32:38,316 --> 01:32:40,885
I have evidence.

1121
01:32:43,287 --> 01:32:45,957
Yeah? What evidence do you got?

1122
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:49,994
Alex: A phone call.
Davana Sealman.

1123
01:32:50,027 --> 01:32:52,196
Threatening...

1124
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:55,400
Threatening the first man
I killed.

1125
01:32:55,433 --> 01:32:57,001
Ellis Van Camp?

1126
01:32:57,034 --> 01:33:02,039
Yes. I have that call
on a... flip...

1127
01:33:02,073 --> 01:33:03,274
- Flash?
- Flash.

1128
01:33:03,307 --> 01:33:05,376
- Flash drive?
- Flash drive.

1129
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:07,112
Where is it?

1130
01:33:09,348 --> 01:33:11,583
I don't know.

1131
01:33:11,617 --> 01:33:13,385
Help, help me...

1132
01:33:14,553 --> 01:33:16,321
Help me remember.

1133
01:33:17,656 --> 01:33:19,458
Please.

1134
01:33:19,491 --> 01:33:21,059
We will.

1135
01:33:22,227 --> 01:33:23,929
We will.

1136
01:33:26,365 --> 01:33:28,467
That makes me sick
to my stomach.

1137
01:33:30,202 --> 01:33:32,571
I'm glad that bastard is dead.

1138
01:33:32,604 --> 01:33:35,507
His mother was covering for him.

1139
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:37,576
Davana Sealman? Vincent: Yeah.

1140
01:33:37,609 --> 01:33:40,212
That woman hasn't had
a parking ticket in her life.

1141
01:33:40,245 --> 01:33:43,415
She knew that her son
was raping minors.

1142
01:33:43,449 --> 01:33:45,751
She also paid for the hit
on Ellis Van Camp.

1143
01:33:45,784 --> 01:33:47,486
Based on what evidence?

1144
01:33:47,519 --> 01:33:50,355
The man she hired, Alex Lewis.
He made it very clear to me...

1145
01:33:50,389 --> 01:33:52,625
Oh, the testimony
of a professional killer?

1146
01:33:52,659 --> 01:33:54,694
Alex Lewis was hired
by William Borden

1147
01:33:54,727 --> 01:33:56,029
for Davana Sealman.

1148
01:33:56,062 --> 01:33:57,030
Isn't this the same man

1149
01:33:57,063 --> 01:33:58,140
who has some kind of dementia?

1150
01:33:58,164 --> 01:33:59,332
Advanced Alzheimer's.

1151
01:33:59,365 --> 01:33:59,999
Yeah, yeah.

1152
01:34:00,033 --> 01:34:01,634
Look, I need real evidence.

1153
01:34:01,668 --> 01:34:03,336
Alright, not just
the fucking testimony

1154
01:34:03,369 --> 01:34:06,506
of some murderer who's
cognitively impaired. Jesus.

1155
01:34:06,539 --> 01:34:08,741
Any decent lawyer would
annihilate him on the stand.

1156
01:34:08,775 --> 01:34:10,710
Listen, apparently,
there's a recording

1157
01:34:10,743 --> 01:34:12,479
of Davana Sealman
on a phone call

1158
01:34:12,512 --> 01:34:15,148
explicitly threatening Van Camp.

1159
01:34:15,181 --> 01:34:18,384
- Well, that I can use.
- I'm working on it.

1160
01:34:18,418 --> 01:34:20,487
Well, you bring me the audio,
and if it's solid,

1161
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,355
I'll make the case.

1162
01:34:22,388 --> 01:34:24,123
Thank you, sir.

1163
01:34:30,163 --> 01:34:31,464
Are you sure you're up for this?

1164
01:34:31,498 --> 01:34:35,134
No, Gerald. I'm definitely
fucking not up for this.

1165
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:49,483
Alex.

1166
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:53,554
Listen. We need to find
that recording.

1167
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:57,124
Without that,
they... they can't bring charges.

1168
01:34:57,157 --> 01:34:59,059
Do you remember where it is?

1169
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:02,563
I... I've been trying
to remember.

1170
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:04,431
Okay.

1171
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:06,634
I can't.

1172
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:09,103
It's lost.

1173
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:13,407
I... I used to make notes. Here.

1174
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,610
- Mm-hm.
- There's no more notes.

1175
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:20,414
I'm sorry. Really. I'm sorry.

1176
01:35:20,447 --> 01:35:22,784
Listen. Without that recording,

1177
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:24,553
there's no case against Sealman.

1178
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:28,590
And there's nothing that I
or anybody can do about it.

1179
01:35:28,623 --> 01:35:30,158
Do you understand that?

1180
01:35:32,627 --> 01:35:35,063
I need you to remember.

1181
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:49,144
Dr. Myers. I have a writ...

1182
01:35:49,177 --> 01:35:51,580
I know, we got a call
you were coming.

1183
01:36:26,248 --> 01:36:29,819
No alcohol swab?

1184
01:36:48,537 --> 01:36:50,439
Hey, hold up.

1185
01:36:50,473 --> 01:36:51,913
Your SAC said,
he doesn't go through.

1186
01:36:51,942 --> 01:36:53,543
- He's with us.
- Can't do it.

1187
01:36:53,577 --> 01:36:55,379
He said for you
to head right in.

1188
01:36:55,412 --> 01:36:58,850
It's okay, man. Just take care.

1189
01:37:07,892 --> 01:37:09,693
He's got a hostage.

1190
01:37:09,726 --> 01:37:12,162
This is a fucking mess, Serra.

1191
01:37:19,703 --> 01:37:21,772
His only demand...

1192
01:37:21,805 --> 01:37:23,674
is to talk to you.

1193
01:37:36,386 --> 01:37:38,523
Hey.

1194
01:37:38,556 --> 01:37:40,391
Watch your ass.

1195
01:38:15,293 --> 01:38:16,995
Man on radio:
They're coming out.

1196
01:38:17,029 --> 01:38:18,796
Hold fire.

1197
01:38:23,035 --> 01:38:24,871
That's Myers.

1198
01:38:24,904 --> 01:38:28,240
Sniper two, do you have a shot
on the subject on the right?

1199
01:38:29,441 --> 01:38:31,376
Man on radio: Affirmative.

1200
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:36,049
Man on radio:
Agent Serra, status?

1201
01:38:36,082 --> 01:38:38,051
You killed the hostage.
Stand down. Stand down!

1202
01:38:38,084 --> 01:38:40,019
Listen to me, Agent Serra,
tactical...

1203
01:38:41,921 --> 01:38:43,489
They sent that man to kill me.

1204
01:38:43,522 --> 01:38:45,624
He walked right past the cops.

1205
01:38:45,657 --> 01:38:47,894
That bitch owns the whole game.

1206
01:38:47,927 --> 01:38:49,628
She doesn't own the FBI.

1207
01:38:52,464 --> 01:38:53,943
- Are you sure about that?
- Listen to me.

1208
01:38:53,967 --> 01:38:55,935
Maybe they'll kill you, too.
Just to...

1209
01:38:55,969 --> 01:38:57,871
Just to b... b... Bury this.

1210
01:38:57,904 --> 01:39:00,339
Yeah, maybe. Alex. Listen...

1211
01:39:00,372 --> 01:39:05,477
Bery. That's spelled B-E-R-Y.

1212
01:39:05,511 --> 01:39:08,548
- No. Alex.
- Right? Yes. Yes. Bery.

1213
01:39:08,581 --> 01:39:10,650
B-E-R-Y.

1214
01:39:11,986 --> 01:39:14,955
You said justice
can't be guaranteed.

1215
01:39:14,989 --> 01:39:16,556
No.

1216
01:39:16,589 --> 01:39:19,626
We owe it to that child,
Vincent.

1217
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:24,397
Alex.

1218
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:27,001
Alex! Alex!

1219
01:40:10,711 --> 01:40:12,613
They won't let Hugo
in the building.

1220
01:40:12,646 --> 01:40:14,448
God, I bet Nussbaum deports him.

1221
01:40:14,481 --> 01:40:17,351
Yeah. Nothing would surprise me.

1222
01:40:18,686 --> 01:40:20,088
Where are they sending you?

1223
01:40:20,121 --> 01:40:22,057
Crimes against Children.

1224
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:24,725
- You?
- Unassigned.

1225
01:40:24,758 --> 01:40:27,628
Linda: Vincent, your heart
was in the right place.

1226
01:40:41,944 --> 01:40:44,080
He fucking remembered.

1227
01:40:44,113 --> 01:40:45,948
He fucking remembered!

1228
01:41:11,207 --> 01:41:13,475
Ellis: You've left me no choice.

1229
01:41:13,508 --> 01:41:15,510
I won't be cut out.

1230
01:41:15,543 --> 01:41:16,787
Look, this doesn't
have to be ugly.

1231
01:41:16,811 --> 01:41:18,680
Sealman: Blackmail
is already ugly.

1232
01:41:18,713 --> 01:41:21,050
Ellis: Look, all...
Sealman: Mr. Van Camp!

1233
01:41:21,083 --> 01:41:22,919
Sealman: We are not negotiating.

1234
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:25,788
You've crossed the line
from which there is no return.

1235
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:28,992
That's it.

1236
01:41:29,026 --> 01:41:31,094
It's not enough.

1237
01:41:31,128 --> 01:41:32,595
What are you talking about?

1238
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:33,864
Well, Alex Lewis is dead.

1239
01:41:33,897 --> 01:41:35,598
Without him,
I don't have corroboration.

1240
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,943
You said, if I bring you
this recording...

1241
01:41:36,967 --> 01:41:40,503
No, no, no, no. The recording
is a threat. Yes.

1242
01:41:40,536 --> 01:41:42,072
Without the hit man,
it's not enough.

1243
01:41:42,105 --> 01:41:43,941
Come on, man, this is a case.

1244
01:41:43,974 --> 01:41:45,943
It's not a case I can win.

1245
01:41:45,976 --> 01:41:47,945
I'm very sorry, Vincent.

1246
01:41:54,217 --> 01:41:55,685
You're kidding me?

1247
01:41:55,718 --> 01:41:58,788
Look, when you're dealing
with that kind of money,

1248
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:01,158
even if I had her
handing the gun to Alex

1249
01:42:01,191 --> 01:42:04,061
and paying him,
she'd probably still win.

1250
01:42:05,062 --> 01:42:07,496
Okay. Okay.

1251
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:10,467
Yeah, the sooner you
realize that, the better.

1252
01:42:11,535 --> 01:42:13,004
Listen, you tell me something.

1253
01:42:14,205 --> 01:42:16,673
Beatriz Leon.

1254
01:42:16,707 --> 01:42:18,608
What does she mean to you, huh?

1255
01:42:18,642 --> 01:42:20,711
Just some lowlife Mexican kid,

1256
01:42:20,744 --> 01:42:22,246
who's probably gonna die anyway?

1257
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:23,613
No, not at all.

1258
01:42:23,647 --> 01:42:24,983
Randy Sealman
would take children

1259
01:42:25,016 --> 01:42:26,117
out of his Detention Centre

1260
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:27,651
and use them
as his fucking sex toys.

1261
01:42:27,684 --> 01:42:29,153
Problem is, we can't prove it.

1262
01:42:29,187 --> 01:42:31,788
You know what's going on.
We all know what's going on.

1263
01:42:31,822 --> 01:42:32,656
Serra!

1264
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:34,125
You're nothing
but a fucking coward.

1265
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:35,692
Okay, that's it, Serra!

1266
01:42:35,726 --> 01:42:38,129
A lot of people,
myself included, are fed up!

1267
01:42:38,162 --> 01:42:39,629
Yeah.

1268
01:42:39,663 --> 01:42:41,631
Time to take a leave, Serra.

1269
01:42:41,665 --> 01:42:43,734
Make it a long one.

1270
01:42:43,767 --> 01:42:46,304
And then let's re-evaluate.

1271
01:42:46,337 --> 01:42:48,439
With pleasure.

1272
01:43:07,292 --> 01:43:08,961
- Yo.
- Hey.

1273
01:43:08,994 --> 01:43:11,230
We should celebrate
your suspension.

1274
01:43:11,263 --> 01:43:13,032
I'm not really up for it.

1275
01:43:13,065 --> 01:43:15,034
I wasn't asking, dipshit.

1276
01:43:15,067 --> 01:43:17,036
Get some fucking clothes on.

1277
01:43:42,962 --> 01:43:44,830
Since when have you
been so social?

1278
01:43:44,864 --> 01:43:46,799
I'm trying to turn over
a new leaf.

1279
01:43:46,832 --> 01:43:49,335
I mean, you can't be an
asshole forever, right?

1280
01:43:49,369 --> 01:43:50,937
I don't know.

1281
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:37,885
- Hey!
- No, no, no.

1282
01:44:37,918 --> 01:44:40,421
Anymore and I'm fucking
toast tomorrow.

1283
01:44:40,454 --> 01:44:42,156
Don't be a pussy.

1284
01:44:42,189 --> 01:44:44,191
It's not like you've got a job.

1285
01:44:44,225 --> 01:44:46,861
I'm good.

1286
01:44:46,894 --> 01:44:48,062
Alright.

1287
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:52,632
Oh, shit. I spaced my wallet.

1288
01:44:54,034 --> 01:44:56,137
Sorry. I'll owe you.

1289
01:44:57,071 --> 01:44:58,705
Asshole.

1290
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:02,675
Sol?

1291
01:45:02,709 --> 01:45:05,212
Man on TV: Murdered
just hours ago at her home.

1292
01:45:05,246 --> 01:45:07,680
According to an El Paso
Police Department spokesmen,

1293
01:45:07,714 --> 01:45:10,017
there are presently no suspects
and no witnesses.

1294
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:13,288
Details are sketchy at this
point. El Paso Police only...

1295
01:45:20,428 --> 01:45:21,762
What's going on?

1296
01:45:29,437 --> 01:45:31,739
Did you just give me an alibi?

1297
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:34,910
Amen.

1297
01:45:35,305 --> 01:46:35,605
