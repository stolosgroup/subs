3
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,650
I know what you're thinking.

4
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,486
A lone rider.

5
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,822
A dystopian world.

6
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,533
A land that's gone to waste.

7
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,036
How did this world
getso broken?

8
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,833
Well, that all began
500 years ago.

9
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,545
Kumandra.

10
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,382
This is what we used to be.

11
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,009
When our land was whole,

12
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,845
and we lived harmoniously
alongside...

13
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,139
dragons.

14
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,640
Magical creatures
who brought us

15
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:42,311
waterand rain and peace.

16
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,190
It was paradise.

17
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,901
But then, the Druun came.

18
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,740
A mindless plague
that spread like wildfire,

19
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,533
multiplying
as they consumed life

20
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:00,037
and turned everyone
they touched into stone.

21
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,457
The dragons fought for us
the best they could,

22
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,669
but it wasn't enough.

23
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,131
That's when
the Mighty Sisudatu,

24
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,674
the last dragon,

25
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,677
concentrated all her magic
into a gem and...

26
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,560
...blasted the Druun away.

27
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,939
Everyone that was turned
to stone came back.

28
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,817
Except the dragons.

29
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,740
All that was left of Sisu
was her gem.

30
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,077
It should have been
this big inspirational moment,

31
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,579
where humanity united
over her sacrifice.

32
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,791
But instead,
people being people,

33
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,835
they all fought to possess

34
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,212
the last remnant
of dragon magic.

35
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,299
Borders were drawn,
Kumandra divided.

36
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,136
We all became enemies,
and the gem had to be hidden.

37
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,515
But that's not how
the world broke.

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,102
That didn't truly happen
until 500 years later,

39
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,312
when I came into the story.

40
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,064
Hmm.

41
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,289
Huh.

42
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,333
Looks like someone's trying
to be clever.

43
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,754
All right, Tuk Tuk,

44
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,589
let's show 'em
what clever really looks like.

45
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,142
Tuk Tuk!

46
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,894
Come on!

47
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,020
Focus!

48
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,065
Thank you.

49
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,405
Hey, bud, that was awesome.
Give me some shell.

50
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,742
I got ya.

51
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,872
Whoa.

52
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,127
Wait a second.

53
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,257
This feels too easy.

54
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,344
Chief Benja.

55
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,431
I know it's your job
to try and stop me,

56
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,141
but you won't.

57
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,977
Don't mistake spirit
for skill, young one.

58
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,687
I promise
you will not set foot

59
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,731
on the Dragon Gem's
inner circle.

60
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,316
Not even a toe.

61
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,610
You might wanna take out
that blade.

62
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,694
You're gonna need it.

63
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,029
Not today.

64
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,607
Boop.

65
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,819
Like I said, not one foot
on the inner circle.

66
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,155
You lost, Raya.

67
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,740
Did I?

68
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,328
Raya...

69
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,455
I probably should have said
two feet.

70
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,792
Hey, don't beat yourself up
too much, Chief Benja.

71
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,627
You gave it your best.

72
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,420
I won't.

73
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,090
And it's either "Father"
or "Ba" to you.

74
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,636
You did good, dewdrop.
You passed the test.

75
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,307
Wow.

76
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,894
The spirit of Sisu.

77
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,364
For generations, our family
has sworn to protect the gem.

78
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,994
Today, you will join
that legacy.

79
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:37,583
Raya, Princess of Heart,
my daughter,

80
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,295
you are now
a Guardian of the Dragon Gem.

81
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,757
Whoa. Ah...

82
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,259
Well, someone's excited.

83
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,677
Well, yeah!

84
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,055
I mean, anyone hoping
to steal the Dragon Gem

85
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,640
now has to face the fury

86
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,268
of the two baddest blades
in all the lands.

87
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,854
I'm glad
you feel prepared, dewdrop,

88
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,565
because I have something
important to tell you.

89
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,693
The other lands, they're on
their way here, as we speak.

90
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,362
They are? Uh...

91
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,905
Okay.

92
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,574
Okay, no, we can do this.
I'm ready.

93
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,785
I know exactly
how we'll stop them.

94
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,788
Really? Tell me what you know
about the other lands.

95
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,748
First... Tail.

96
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,751
A sweltering desert
with sneaky mercenaries

97
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,711
who fight dirty.

98
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,171
Second, Talon.

99
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,674
A floating market famous
for fast deals

100
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,551
and fighters
with even faster hands.

101
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,554
Third, Spine.

102
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,514
A frigid bamboo forest

103
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,559
guarded by
exceptionally large warriors,

104
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,853
and their giant axes.

105
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,232
Fourth, Fang.
Our fiercest enemy.

106
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,568
A nation protected
by angry assassins,

107
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,778
and their even angrier cats.

108
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,782
Okay,

109
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:37,202
so we're gonna need some
crossbows and catapults and...

110
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,372
Ooh! What about
flaming catapults?

111
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:44,626
Or, how about
shrimp paste from Tail.

112
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,088
lemongrass from Talon,
bamboo shoots from Spine,

113
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,508
chilis from Fang
and palm sugar from Heart?

114
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,051
We'll poison them?

115
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,721
No, we're not going
to poison them

116
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,389
and we're not going
to fight them.

117
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,183
We're going to share a meal
with them.

118
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,643
- Wait, what?
- I invited them.

119
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,978
But they're our enemies.

120
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,396
They're only our enemies

121
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,440
because they think
the Dragon Gem

122
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,192
magically brings
us prosperity.

123
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,527
That's ridiculous.
It doesn't do that.

124
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,237
They assume it does,

125
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,573
just like we assume things
about them.

126
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,618
Raya, there's a reason why
each land

127
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,245
is named after
a part of the dragon.

128
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,999
We were once unified.
Harmoniously as one.

129
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,083
Kumandra.

130
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,336
That's ancient history, Ba.

131
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,546
But it doesn't have to be.

132
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,465
Listen, if we don't stop

133
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,759
and learn to trust
one another again,

134
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,052
it's only a matter of time

135
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,179
before we tear
each other apart.

136
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,225
This isn't the world
I want you to live in.

137
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,563
I believe that
we can be Kumandra again.

138
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,441
But someone has to take
the first step.

139
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,196
Trust me.

140
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,426
Things look
a little tense, Ba.

141
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,679
Don't worry,
I'm gonna open with a joke.

142
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:19,972
Please don't.

143
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,431
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

144
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,185
People of Tail, Talon,

145
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,729
Spine, and Fang,

146
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,773
welcome to Heart.

147
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,318
For far too long,
we have been enemies,

148
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,696
but today is a new day.

149
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,741
Today, we can be Kumandra
once more.

150
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,745
Nice speech, Chief Benja.

151
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,539
But why'd you really
bring us here?

152
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,623
Are you gonna rob us?

153
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,292
Why would he need to rob us?

154
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,627
The land of Heart
already has everything.

155
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,130
Oh, it's easy to pontificate
on Kumandra

156
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,174
when you hold the mightiest
weapon in all the lands.

157
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,344
The gem's not a weapon.
It's a sacred relic.

158
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,181
Kumandra!
Kumandra's a joke!

159
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,932
He brought us all this way

160
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,767
to talk about fairy tales.

161
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,269
This is pointless!

162
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,612
I have something to say.

163
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,618
Who's hungry?

164
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,121
Oh.

165
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,876
Go ahead. It's all right.

166
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,258
I'm Namaari, of Fang.

167
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,470
Hi, Namaari. I'm Raya.

168
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,889
Is that Sisu?

169
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,392
Sorry, um, yeah,

170
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,187
I might be a little bit
of a dragon nerd.

171
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,440
Hey, I'm the one wearing
the Sisu fan necklace.

172
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,025
Come on.

173
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,610
Have you eaten yet?

174
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,161
Seriously?

175
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,080
Your mom actually said that?

176
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,041
Awkward.
Okay, next question.

177
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,293
Hand-to-hand or swords?

178
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,004
- Blades all day.
- Right?

179
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,423
Okay, dressy or casual?

180
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,925
Only a monster would choose

181
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,510
to wear this outfit
on the regular.

182
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,429
Uh, rice or stew?

183
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,100
I didn't think
that'd stump you.

184
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,936
Uh... This is actually
one of the first times

185
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,062
I've had rice in awhile.

186
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:33,939
Really?

187
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,775
Fang may look nice
on the outside,

188
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,028
but we have some pretty
big holes on the inside.

189
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,405
Oh.

190
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,032
Sorry. Didn't mean
to bring it down.

191
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,701
So, where were we?

192
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,119
We both have single parents

193
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,829
who are terrible
at telling jokes.

194
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,581
We're both warrior women

195
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,332
who despise uncomfortable
formal wear.

196
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,959
And we're both Sisu superfans.

197
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,252
Yeah.

198
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,132
You know, Fang legend says
she's still out there.

199
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,968
Sisu? You're kidding, right?

200
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,928
Wanna see something?

201
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,264
Are you supposed to have that?

202
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,599
No.

203
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:09,850
According to this,

204
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,396
after the Mighty Sisu
blasted away all the Druun,

205
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,566
she fell into the water
and floated downstream.

206
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,903
Legends say she's now sleeping
at the river's end.

207
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,031
But which river?
There's, like, hundreds.

208
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,115
I don't know.

209
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,619
But if we could find it,
could you imagine?

210
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,871
A dragon back in the world.

211
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,333
Things could be
so much better.

212
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:36,835
Yeah.

213
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,006
Maybe we really could be
Kumandra again.

214
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,221
Here.

215
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,223
Whoa.

216
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,307
Really?

217
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,268
From one dragon nerd
to another.

218
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,439
Hmm.

219
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,652
Hey.

220
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,947
Come with me, dep la.
I wanna show you something.

221
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:30,180
The spirit of Sisu.
I can feel it.

222
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,890
It's the last bit
of dragon magic

223
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,017
left in the whole world.

224
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,938
I see why
Heart guards it so closely.

225
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,651
Thank you, dep la.
You've been very helpful.

226
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,282
In a different world, maybe
we could have been friends,

227
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,534
but I have to do
what's right for Fang.

228
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,936
Chief Virana, I'm so glad
Fang accepted our invitation.

229
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,486
Huh?

230
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,575
There is no way
you're taking Sisu's gem.

231
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,912
Sorry. It's Fang's now.

232
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,392
You will not set foot on
the Dragon Gem's inner circle.

233
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:58,477
What's going on?

234
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,645
What is this?

235
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,063
Fang's
making a play for the gem!

236
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,648
No! Spine should have the gem!

237
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,149
Not if we get to it first!

238
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,817
Our blades say different.

239
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,910
Listen to me!

240
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,411
We have a choice.

241
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,956
We can tear each other apart,

242
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:23,293
or we can come together
and build a better world.

243
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,088
It's not too late.

244
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:31,176
I still believe
we can be Kumandra again.

245
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,016
Ba!

246
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,560
Out of my way!

247
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,144
The gem belongs to Spine!

248
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,980
Give me the gem!

249
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,446
No... No...

250
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,590
Druun.

251
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,311
There's still magic in them!

252
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,687
- Get the pieces!
- No!

253
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,987
Ba! Come on, we have to go!

254
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,455
They're repelled by water.

255
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,165
Hurry! Get to the river!

256
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,171
Ba, get up! Come on!

257
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,548
Please, we have
to keep moving.

258
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,674
Get up!

259
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,555
Ba! We don't have time!

260
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,521
Stand up! I'll help...

261
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,689
Raya, you have to listen.

262
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,067
You are the Guardian
of the Dragon Gem.

263
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,693
Ba, why are you saying this?

264
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,073
There's still light in this.
There's still hope.

265
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,575
No! We can make it together.

266
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,828
You're okay.

267
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,915
Raya.
Don't give up on them.

268
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,003
I love you, my dewdrop.

269
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,171
Ba?

270
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,798
No!

271
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,318
Ba!

272
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:00,701
Ba.

273
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,128
Please let this be it.

274
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,881
Whoa!

275
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,217
What are you doing,
you big fur bug?

276
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,719
Hey, buddy, focus.

277
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,847
Eyes forward, Tuk Tuk.

278
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,723
Good boy.

279
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,934
You're so easily distracted.

280
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,750
You're getting a little
too big for this, bud.

281
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,723
Six years of searching

282
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:31,393
and we end up
at a literal shipwreck.

283
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,565
That's not a bad sign, is it?

284
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,367
Sisudatu...

285
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,577
Um...

286
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:32,329
I don't know
if you're listening.

287
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,500
I've searched every river
to find you,

288
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,963
and now I'm here
at the very last one.

289
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,844
Look, there's not
a lot of us left,

290
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,431
and we really...
We really need your help.

291
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,727
If I can be honest,

292
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,438
I really need your help.

293
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,693
I made a mistake.

294
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,195
I trusted someone
I shouldn't have, and...

295
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,699
...now the world's broken.

296
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,413
Sisudatu...

297
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:20,169
I just really, really
want my ba back.

298
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,047
Please.

299
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:34,433
Okay...

300
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,106
Here goes everything.

301
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,944
Suvaa de draa sim

302
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:49,072
Mandra de draa lim

303
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:53,785
Bavaa de draa
Tomben

304
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,101
I know, buddy,
I haven't forgot...

305
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,496
Oh, my... Where am I?

306
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:41,291
Pengu? Amba? Pranee?
Are you here?

307
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,459
Oh, Mighty Sisu.

308
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:43,961
Who said that?

309
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:46,505
Hello?

310
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,299
Hello?

311
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,260
Oh!

312
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,011
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

313
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:54,721
Not too bad.
Just a little dusty.

314
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,139
Let me get that for ya.

315
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,349
Sisu?

316
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,061
You are Sisu?

317
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,146
And you're people.

318
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,398
What's your name?

319
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,482
Raya. I'm Raya.

320
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,902
And you're not made of stone,
which means...

321
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:09,987
It worked!

322
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,071
We did it!

323
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,156
You hear that, Pengu?
It worked!

324
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,658
I didn't mess it up!

325
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,118
Is that food?

326
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:17,744
I was so focused
on saving the world,

327
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,079
I forgot to have
breakfast today.

328
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,664
Today?

329
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,000
When exactly
do you think today is?

330
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,168
Tuesday.

331
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,379
I mean...
Mmm.

332
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,756
What is this delightful
culinary treat?

333
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:34,261
It's jackfruit jerky.
I dried it myself.

334
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:36,972
Well, compliments to the chef.

335
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,056
Wanna finish this, Skippy?

336
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,225
Uh...

337
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,229
Sisu, there are a few things
I need to catch you up on.

338
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,397
Oh, yeah?

339
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,858
You broke it?

340
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,571
Oh, oh. Oh, my. This is bad.
This is bad.

341
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,656
I've been asleep
for 500 years,

342
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,491
you brought back
the Druun,

343
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,035
and none of my brothers
and sisters came back.

344
00:26:58,202 --> 00:26:59,536
Why didn't they come back?

345
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:00,787
I don't know.

346
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,289
Also, you broke the gem!

347
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,249
But I still have
a big chunk of it, though.

348
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,959
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

349
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,253
If you lost a puppy,
and I said...

350
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,130
"Well, we still
have a big chunk of it!"

351
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,841
Would that make you
feel better?

352
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,676
Can't you just make
another one?

353
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,678
No, I can't just
"make another one."

354
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,722
But you're a dragon.

355
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,016
I'm gonna be real
with you, all right?

356
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:24,853
I'm not, like,
the best dragon, ya know?

357
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,147
But you saved the world.

358
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,691
I did do that. That's true.

359
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,318
But have you ever done
like a group project,

360
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,402
but there's, like,
that one kid

361
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,570
who didn't pitch in as much,

362
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,906
but still ended up
with the same grade?

363
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,535
Yeah, I wasn't the one
who actually made the gem.

364
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,662
I just turned it in.

365
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:44,998
Whoa. Uh...

366
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:47,084
You're glowing.

367
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,710
Oh, thank you.

368
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,504
I use aloe and river slime
to maintain my...

369
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,297
No, no. Look!

370
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:55,384
Oh! This is my little sister
Amba's magic.

371
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:56,677
I got the glow!

372
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,011
Your little sister's magic?

373
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,972
Yeah, every dragon
has a unique magic.

374
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,223
Okay, what's yours?

375
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,018
I'm a really strong swimmer.

376
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,688
Wait, wait, wait,
you touched this gem piece

377
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:08,772
and it gave you powers.

378
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,691
You know what
this means, right?

379
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,693
I no longer need
a night light?

380
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:15,904
What? No!
You're still connected to the gem's magic,

381
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,322
and that means
you can still use it

382
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:18,407
to save the world.

383
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,117
If we can get
all the other gem pieces...

384
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,577
- I can reassemble it...
- ...you can reassemble it...

385
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,328
...and boom
the Druun away!

386
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,038
And bring my ba back?

387
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,374
And bring
all of Kumandra back.

388
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,536
Princess Namaari,

389
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,413
the Tail lands
are infested with Druun.

390
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,874
Benja's daughter is as good
as stone out here.

391
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,793
Retrieving
some useless dragon scroll

392
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,670
isn't worth the risk.

393
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,427
Anyone else wanna question
why we're out here?

394
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:38,862
Okay, so here's the sitch.

395
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,697
After the gem broke,
each piece was taken

396
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,699
by one of the chiefs
of the five lands,

397
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:46,537
Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon,
and Tail.

398
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:48,205
Where we are now.

399
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,209
Wow. So many questions.

400
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,711
First one,
why am I wearing this?

401
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:57,589
Well, we don't want
to attract attention.

402
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,883
Oh, you definitely chose
the right hat for that.

403
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:01,885
So, what makes you think
the Tail chief's here?

404
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:11,520
Because this place
didn't just booby-trap itself.

405
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:17,192
This doesn't make sense.

406
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,819
None of this
would stop a Druun.

407
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,446
It's not to stop Druun.
It's to stop people.

408
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,614
Hmm.

409
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,125
What?

410
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,043
Why are you looking at me
like that?

411
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,337
Nothing.

412
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,590
I'm just not used to
seeing dragons.

413
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:42,593
Impressed, huh? Wait until
you see my backstroke.

414
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,595
I'm wicked
when I hit that liquid.

415
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,555
I got water skills that kill.

416
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:48,724
I slaughter
when I hit the water.

417
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:52,853
I'm, like, really good
at swimming, through rhyme.

418
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,021
I was trying to make that...

419
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,147
That I'm really good
at swim...

420
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:57,191
I'm a good swimmer,
is basically what I'm...

421
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,610
Okay, um,
we need to keep going.

422
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,700
- Oh, no!
- What? What is it?

423
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,411
We forgot to bring a gift
for the Tail chief.

424
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,829
I'm sorry. A gift?

425
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,456
Yeah. A gift says,

426
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,125
"You can trust me,
can I trust you?"

427
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,546
Aw. Hey there,
little fella.

428
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,049
This beetle's got a booty.

429
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,384
Uh... Careful.
It's a Toot N Boom.

430
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,802
Why is it called a...

431
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,558
Got it. Noted. Makes sense.

432
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,066
Uh...

433
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,150
You have to admit though,

434
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:41,777
these bug booties
are kind of cute.

435
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,246
I'd say
we found the Tail chief.

436
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,789
What happened to her?

437
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:54,998
From the looks of it,

438
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:56,583
she was hoarding the gem

439
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,710
and became a victim
of her own traps.

440
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,129
Well, you gotta admire
her commitment.

441
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,219
Okay. Hold on.

442
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:13,100
Oh, we were doing
a jumpy thing!

443
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,643
So sorry. My bad.

444
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,770
I get it now. I'm with it.

445
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,486
Sisu...

446
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,029
don't.

447
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,557
Two down, three to go.

448
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,024
I just shapechanged!
Into people!

449
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,525
Dragons can do that?

450
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,569
This was my sister
Pranee's thing.

451
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:08,405
Look at my people arms
and my people face.

452
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:10,657
Look how close my butt is
to my head.

453
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,618
Now that
you don't have to hide me,

454
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,703
getting the rest of the gems
is gonna be a breeze.

455
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,122
Yeah, well, this one was easy,

456
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,665
but the rest of them
are being held

457
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:21,793
by a bunch
of no-good binturis.

458
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,253
Binturi?

459
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:26,590
That's not a very nice way
to describe an old friend.

460
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:30,719
Namaari.

461
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,638
What's drippin', dep la?

462
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:35,390
Oh, I see you've finally
made a new friend.

463
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:36,892
And here I was worried

464
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,144
you were gonna end up
becoming a cat lady

465
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:40,562
like me.

466
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,899
Something tells me
you're not besties.

467
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:47,236
Stealing Dragon Gem pieces,
are we? Why?

468
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,113
What can I say?
Bling is my thing.

469
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,365
Hmm.

470
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:54,159
I gotta admit, Raya,
until a few months ago,

471
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:55,577
I thought you were stone.

472
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:58,455
But then, someone stole
Fang's dragon scroll.

473
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,582
Oh, is that why
you're chasing me?

474
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,126
And here I thought
it was because you missed me.

475
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,715
Are you really looking
for Sisu?

476
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,468
What are you, 12?

477
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:14,221
Yeah, I actually was looking
for Sisu.

478
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,932
Oh, and guess what?
I found her.

479
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,810
Say hi, Sisu.

480
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:20,936
Hi!

481
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,312
It's very nice to meet you,

482
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:26,108
and I love your hair
and your cats' hair.

483
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:28,402
Take them.

484
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:39,955
Run!

485
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,626
Not like that! Two legs!

486
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,711
Right!

487
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,270
Tuk Tuk! Roll!

488
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:07,357
Whoa!

489
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:16,742
Jump!

490
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:19,661
Who was that girl?

491
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:20,787
That's Namaari.

492
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,999
She's the backstabbing binturi
that broke the world.

493
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,093
Wow, those cats
are really fast, huh?

494
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:38,263
What do cats and Druun
have in common?

495
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:41,558
Um... They have no souls?

496
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:44,061
And they both hate water.

497
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:45,646
- Oh.
- Hold on!

498
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:00,536
Hello? Is anybody here?

499
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,583
Welcome to the world-famous
Shrimp-orium.

500
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,919
My name is Boun.
I'll be your server today.

501
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:10,629
Would you like to hear
our daily specials?

502
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:11,880
Yes, please!

503
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,382
We got shrimp, we got congee.

504
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,384
We got a shrimp congee
that won't quit.

505
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:17,135
The captain,
where is the captain?

506
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,595
Let me go get him.

507
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,015
What's up, my new customers?

508
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,642
I'm Captain Boun,

509
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:26,436
the owner, chef,
and chief financial officer

510
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,146
of the Shrimp-orium.

511
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,231
How can I help you?

512
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:30,649
Well, I'm Sisu and...

513
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,568
And we need
to get to Talon now.

514
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:35,112
I'm sorry. The Shrimp-orium
is not a water taxi.

515
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,239
Toi, that's a lot of jade!

516
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,242
Half now, half when we arrive
in Talon. Deal?

517
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,578
Clasp onto your congee.

518
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,454
Today's special is

519
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:45,622
to go.

520
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,840
Uh, Captain Boun?

521
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,425
Does this thing go any faster?

522
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,887
Whoa! You didn't tell me
Fang was after you!

523
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,138
This is gonna cost you extra!

524
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,514
Don't worry, I got it.

525
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:05,184
What is she doing?

526
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:16,987
What is happening?

527
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,114
My friend's
a really strong swimmer.

528
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,039
Bye-bye, binturi.

529
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,085
Princess Namaari,
if they're after gem pieces,

530
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:33,879
their next stop
would be Talon.

531
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:35,589
We're not following them
to Talon.

532
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:36,882
We're going back to Fang.

533
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,842
I need to speak
with Chief Virana.

534
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,207
Sisu? Sisu?

535
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,792
Ah!

536
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,418
Please get out of there.

537
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:14,962
I'm a water dragon.

538
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,964
This is water.
It's sort of my thing.

539
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,340
You wanna come in?

540
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:19,633
Someone could see you.

541
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,511
Oh. Do you mean Captain Pop
and Lock over there?

542
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:23,846
What, are you scared

543
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,389
he's gonna challenge me
to a dance battle?

544
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,732
Sisu, I saw people
lose their minds

545
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:36,817
over a Dragon Gem.

546
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:39,903
Can you imagine what they'd do
over an actual dragon?

547
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,322
Look, we need you
to make this all work.

548
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,409
Until we have all the gems,
you have to stay human.

549
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,493
Please.

550
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,287
Wow, you really
got some trust issues.

551
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,164
Look, my father
blindly trusted people,

552
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:53,584
and now, he's stone.

553
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:55,669
Hey, we'll get your ba back.

554
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:58,714
I got you, girl.
Come on, who's your dragon?

555
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:02,926
I mean, human. Because
I'm gonna be a human until...

556
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,094
Yeah, you... You get it.

557
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,016
Okay, who's hungry?

558
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,225
Oh, I am.

559
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,352
Two house specials.
How spicy would you like it?

560
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,980
Hot, hotter,
or Boun-goes-the-dynamite?

561
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:16,481
- Bring on the heat!
- Yeah, no.

562
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,108
No, I don't think so.

563
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,401
Uh, what are you doing?

564
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:20,944
We don't
know him. It could be poison.

565
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,905
Why would he poison us?

566
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:24,406
Yeah, why would I poison you?

567
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,116
First, to get my jade purse,

568
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:27,326
second, to steal my sword,

569
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:31,038
and third, I don't know,
to kidnap my Tuk Tuk.

570
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:34,625
All good points,
but if this is poison...

571
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:37,044
Mmm!

572
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:38,545
...you're gonna die happy.

573
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:41,089
Yeah, thanks,
but we got our own eats.

574
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,512
This is delicious.

575
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:49,139
By the way, not poison.

576
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,059
But it's...

577
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,145
It's hot. Ooh, it's hot!

578
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:57,064
It's hot! It's really hot!

579
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:58,774
Oh, my! Oh! Water!

580
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,485
Boun? Captain Boun?
We need water on deck!

581
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,274
I know, buddy.

582
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:25,235
You know, during the day,

583
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,404
you can almost forget
they're here,

584
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:29,198
but at night...

585
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:33,243
This is why
I never leave the boat.

586
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,120
You're a smart kid.

587
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,207
What are Druun, anyways?

588
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:42,169
A plague.
Born from human discord.

589
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,546
They've always been here.

590
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:48,008
Waiting for a moment
of weakness to attack.

591
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:52,221
They're like
the opposite of dragons.

592
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:56,767
Instead of bringing water
and life to the world,

593
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,727
they're like a relentless fire

594
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,479
that consumes everything
in its wake

595
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:05,067
until there's nothing left
except ash and stone.

596
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:09,321
They took my family.

597
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:16,453
They took mine, too.

598
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,752
Looks like we're here.

599
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,507
So, where are you guys heading
after Talon?

600
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:12,759
I might be heading there, too.

601
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,430
I mean, for a fee, of course.

602
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,849
Of course.

603
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:24,897
Wow! What a smart way
to Druun-proof your house.

604
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:26,148
Build right on the water.

605
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:28,066
People of Talon are geniuses.

606
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:30,235
Yeah. Talon may look nice,

607
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:33,113
but it's a hotspot for
pickpockets and con artists.

608
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,741
Lucky for me. Empty pockets!

609
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,159
Okay, so here's the good news.

610
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:38,869
I know where the gem piece is.

611
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:39,953
The bad news?

612
00:43:40,037 --> 00:43:43,040
It's being held by
the notorious Chief of Talon,

613
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,124
Dang Hai.

614
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,753
What Dang Hai lacks in style,
he makes up in mean.

615
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:48,837
Hmm.

616
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,214
Gotcha.

617
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:51,882
Now, we're just gonna have to
turn up the charm.

618
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:53,008
Let's go get him a gift.

619
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:55,636
Sisu, I think maybe
it's safer for you

620
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:57,221
to stay here on the boat.

621
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:58,305
What?

622
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:01,141
Without you, we can't
put the gem back together.

623
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:02,351
But I wanna help.

624
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:04,186
I know, and you will.

625
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:05,938
By staying safe.

626
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,065
I'll be back
before you know it.

627
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:12,194
If you see any hungry faces,
send 'em my way.

628
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:14,112
You got it, Captain.

629
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:42,558
All right,
there's Dang Hai's house.

630
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:45,310
No detours
till we score that Dragon Gem.

631
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:48,021
Whoa. What in the...

632
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,609
Uh...

633
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,069
Okay.

634
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:59,408
Hey, baby, toddler, thing...

635
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:00,659
...whatever you're called.

636
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,453
It's really late.
What are you doing out here?

637
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,706
Where are your parents?

638
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:07,583
Hey, uh, whose baby...

639
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,626
What? Ongis?

640
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,711
Drop 'em!

641
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,130
Ow!

642
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,802
Really? A con-baby?

643
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,892
Ah, this is giving me
bad feels.

644
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:26,602
Chief Dang Hai
does not sound like

645
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:27,978
someone you could smooth talk.

646
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,897
And Raya
didn't even bring a gift.

647
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:32,691
That's it. I'm going shopping.

648
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,860
Oh, wait.
I don't have any money.

649
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:36,153
You're an adult.

650
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,529
You could just put it
on credit.

651
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:39,323
Oh... Uh, what's credit?

652
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,200
It's kinda like a promise.

653
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:42,784
You take what you want now,

654
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:44,369
and you promise
you'll pay it back later.

655
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,538
Pay it back later? Huh!

656
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:48,582
What an amazing concept.

657
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,042
Thanks, Captain Boun.

658
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,714
I'll be buying this
with credit.

659
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,051
Oh, Dang Hai's
gonna love this!

660
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:00,302
Credit, please.

661
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:03,222
Oh, I like that. Uh, yeah,
I'll be using credit, yes.

662
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:04,932
I love credit!

663
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:06,225
Hey, you!

664
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,103
Are you going
to pay for any of that?

665
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:11,188
Oh!

666
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,649
Right, right.
No, this is on credit.

667
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,526
Yeah, I'm gonna pay it
back later.

668
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:17,903
Pay us back later?
We don't know you.

669
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,488
You have no credit here.

670
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,573
- Pay us right now.
- Now?

671
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:23,408
I don't have anything,

672
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,702
but if I could just find
my girl Raya,

673
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:28,038
she has a sword, dried eats,

674
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:29,456
two Dragon Gem pieces.

675
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:31,250
No, we don't!
What? Who said that?

676
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,626
You better pay up, binturi.

677
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:33,836
This isn't a charity.

678
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:35,128
Who do you think
you're stealing from?

679
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:37,172
Get away from her!

680
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,341
Can't you see
she's new in town?

681
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:41,760
Come, dear. Don't be afraid.

682
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:43,637
It's okay.

683
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:54,648
Hey, watch out!

684
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:14,793
Bye!

685
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:21,800
Diaper!

686
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,151
Thanks.

687
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:40,777
So, it's none of my business,

688
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:42,905
but using your baby charm
to rip people off...

689
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:45,532
...is super sketchy.

690
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,619
All right,
where is your family?

691
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:51,205
Mm.

692
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:55,709
Oh...

693
00:47:57,294 --> 00:47:58,295
Right.

694
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:06,261
Hey.

695
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,931
How would you like to earn
some honest loot?

696
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:10,349
Gah?

697
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:35,666
All right, Dang Hai,

698
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:37,292
I'll take that
Dragon Gem piece.

699
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,419
Whoa! I'm not Dang Hai.

700
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:43,006
I'm Chai, the flower guy.

701
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:44,258
Where is Dang Hai?

702
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:46,176
He's right over there.

703
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:49,763
What? Who has his gem piece?

704
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,474
The most vicious chief

705
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:54,518
Talon has ever seen.

706
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:59,189
Those folks were,
like, crazy mad.

707
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:00,941
I just wanted
to bring some gifts

708
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,401
to the Talon chief Dang Hai.

709
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:04,903
Is that who
you're looking for, dear?

710
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:07,531
I know exactly where he is.

711
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:08,657
You do?

712
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,284
Mm-hmm. I will take you there.

713
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,245
See? That's what I've been
trying to tell my girl Raya.

714
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:15,247
And she's all like,
"You can't trust people."

715
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:16,498
"Don't talk to anyone."

716
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:18,876
"I only eat terrible foods
I dried myself."

717
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,794
Come, dear.

718
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:24,214
Chief Dang Hai
is just outside the city,

719
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,757
beyond the gates.

720
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:28,802
Away from
the water, huh? Wow.

721
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:31,013
He really likes living
on the edge.

722
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:33,390
Hi there, Dang Hai.

723
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:34,766
Um, I'm Sisu,

724
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:38,562
and I've come here
to offer you some...

725
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:41,857
Uh...

726
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,367
Now, you're gonna tell me

727
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:56,455
where I can find
those other Dragon Gem pieces,

728
00:49:56,622 --> 00:50:01,460
or I'll have to leave you
outside with that thing.

729
00:50:01,627 --> 00:50:02,794
Take your pick.

730
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:05,005
But I... I trusted you.

731
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:07,049
Big mistake.

732
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:08,675
You better talk fast.

733
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,136
It looks hungry.

734
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,517
No. No, no. No, no, no!

735
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:18,727
Raya!

736
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:19,811
Stop her!

737
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:23,482
Sisu, I told you
to stay on the boat.

738
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:24,858
Sorry!

739
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:26,693
Hold on to this for me,
will ya?

740
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,281
Fog?

741
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,992
Yeah. That was
my brother Jagan's magic.

742
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:36,328
Okay.
Three down, two to go.

743
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:39,581
All right, Captain Boun,
next stop, Spine...

744
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:40,666
Aah!

745
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,585
Thanks for the new customers!

746
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:45,796
Yeah, I sort of promised
to buy them

747
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:47,172
all the congee they could eat.

748
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,800
Well, we're stuck with them
for a while

749
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:52,594
'cause ongis have
nine stomachs.

750
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:53,679
Oh, toi.

751
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:54,763
I can't believe it.

752
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,640
That old lady
was really gonna hurt me.

753
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:58,976
Well, I'm sorry, Sisu,

754
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,019
but that's what
the world is now.

755
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:02,771
You can't trust anyone.

756
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,607
Does that include babies?

757
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:07,985
- Uh, well...
- She's so cute.

758
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:09,778
I mean, look at those cheeks.

759
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:13,282
Hi, I'm Sisu.

760
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:19,371
She loves my face.

761
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:22,416
Yeah, watch out
she doesn't steal your teeth.

762
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:23,834
Here, let me help you.

763
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:25,627
Oh, that's so sweet.

764
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:28,255
Okay, that's, uh...
That's too much sweet...

765
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:30,215
Too much sweetness.
It's too much!

766
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,190
Chief Virana,
we're running out of room.

767
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:48,650
We need to expand
to the mainland.

768
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:50,652
And how do you propose
we handle the Druun,

769
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:52,154
General Atitāya?

770
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:53,280
Without proper protection,

771
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:55,532
it would be a death sentence
for our people.

772
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,743
I might have a solution
for that, Mother.

773
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,245
My little morning mist...

774
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,372
Oh, it's good to see you home.

775
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:05,584
I located Raya.
She's out stealing gem pieces.

776
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:06,835
What?

777
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:08,545
I'd like to take
the royal army

778
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,130
and intercept her in Spine.

779
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,758
Well,
if she's going into Spine,

780
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:15,427
I doubt there'll be much left
of her to intercept.

781
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:17,387
She's more capable
than you realize.

782
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,097
We have to stop her.

783
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:21,892
Walk with me.

784
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:24,686
Look around.

785
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:28,398
We made all this
by making smart decisions,

786
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:29,733
not emotional ones.

787
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:31,985
We are safe.

788
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:35,072
Our canal protects us
from those monsters.

789
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:37,616
I don't think it's wise
to risk yourself

790
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:38,867
when you don't have to.

791
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:40,536
But you heard the general.

792
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:43,288
We're running out of space.
We need to expand.

793
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:47,000
If we had all the gem pieces,
we could do that safely.

794
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,126
You're right.

795
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:50,045
This isn't
an emotional decision.

796
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:51,839
It's the only decision
we can make

797
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,549
to secure Fang's future.

798
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:01,932
Namaari, you're truly growing

799
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:04,017
into the leader
I raised you to be.

800
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:07,145
General Atitāya,
ready the royal army

801
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:08,647
for my daughter's command.

802
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,400
Thank you, Mother.
I won't let you down.

803
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,450
Hey! Stop eating!

804
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,081
Whoa!

805
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:29,084
Sorry, buddy, I got this.

806
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:30,544
Did you just throw
a shrimp at me?

807
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:31,920
That's not even edible!

808
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:33,130
- Hey!
- Don't look at me...

809
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,214
Uh... Hey, guys?

810
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:35,340
...like that,
you fuzzy garbage can!

811
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:36,717
Do you wanna play
hide-and-seek?

812
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:40,012
All right. Ready?

813
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,431
One.

814
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:44,808
Two.

815
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:48,228
- Thanks.
- Two and a half.

816
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,063
Three.

817
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:52,858
Remind me to never have kids.

818
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,360
Being people is hard.

819
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:56,445
Yep.

820
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:57,988
Six.

821
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,781
Seven.

822
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:01,617
You have small heads.

823
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:02,826
No tails.

824
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,661
You lie to get what you want,

825
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:06,163
like the Talon chief
back there.

826
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,081
Yeah, well,
the world's broken.

827
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:09,708
You can't trust anyone.

828
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,585
Or maybe the world's broken

829
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,337
because you don't
trust anyone.

830
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,756
You sound just like my ba.

831
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:17,508
Well, he sounds like
a smart man.

832
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:19,343
Yeah, he was.

833
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,470
I really wanted
to believe him.

834
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:22,930
I really wanted to believe

835
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:25,098
that we could be
Kumandra again.

836
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:26,350
And we can.

837
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:28,852
Literally thousands of people
turned to stone

838
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:30,103
would argue otherwise.

839
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,147
That doesn't mean
you shouldn't try.

840
00:54:32,314 --> 00:54:35,067
And I did.
And you know what happened?

841
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:38,362
I got kicked in the back
by someone who gave me a gift.

842
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,280
Look around.

843
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,157
We're a world
of orphans because

844
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,368
people couldn't stop fighting
over a gem.

845
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:46,703
Wanna know why other dragons
didn't come back?

846
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:49,748
It's because
people don't deserve them.

847
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:51,166
But you can change that.

848
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,669
No, Sisu, I am done trying.

849
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:55,295
Kumandra is a fairy tale.

850
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:57,214
The only thing
important to me now

851
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:58,549
is bringing my ba back.

852
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,302
Um... I think we're in Spine.

853
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:09,184
Sisu!

854
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:10,853
Hey, my congee!

855
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,730
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

856
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,661
Sisu! Come back! Please!

857
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:28,912
What... What are you doing?

858
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,831
I'm going to show you
that you're wrong!

859
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:34,501
How? By getting squashed by
a bunch of Spine rage-heads?

860
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:35,586
No.

861
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:36,712
By proving to you

862
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,463
that if you wanna get
someone's trust,

863
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,090
you have to give
a little trust first.

864
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:41,383
Wait, Sisu, don't...

865
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:47,472
In hindsight,
maybe I was a little hasty,

866
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:49,266
but, uh, who's hungry?

867
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:51,226
No? I'll leave you alone.

868
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:56,982
Okay, where are we?

869
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,028
Interesting choice of digs.

870
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:09,328
You two must be
dung of brain

871
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:12,956
to think you could steal
Spine's Dragon Gem.

872
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:15,125
Gem?

873
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,752
Who said anything about gems?

874
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:17,836
We have no interest in gems.

875
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,047
Okay, yeah, I can see how

876
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:21,340
that makes me look
like a liar.

877
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:22,966
Actually, I think
it was the lying

878
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,051
that made you look
like a liar.

879
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:31,141
I'm not sure what's funny.

880
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:34,603
Your fear
is like delectable nectar

881
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,731
feeding the tum-tum
of my soul.

882
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:39,107
It's good.

883
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:41,485
Tastes like... mango.

884
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:43,111
Oh. I love mango.

885
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,489
Of course you love mango!

886
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:47,699
Only a tongue-less
cretin wouldn't.

887
00:56:47,783 --> 00:56:48,784
Oh, toi!

888
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:50,410
It's been such a long time

889
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,578
since I've last peered

890
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:53,830
into the eyes
of a trembling enemy.

891
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,333
Where has the time gone?

892
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,336
It's been so long.

893
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,713
He seems lonely.

894
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:03,507
No! I'm not lonely.

895
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:05,342
I'm a Spine warrior.

896
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:08,470
I was born and bred to do
only one thing.

897
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:10,097
To invoke fear

898
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,975
and to crush the skulls
of my enemies!

899
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:14,268
That's actually two things.

900
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:19,147
Look at your face.

901
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:21,692
Hey. What do you plan on doing
with us?

902
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:23,777
Oh, it's gonna be bad.

903
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:25,153
Horrifying!

904
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,197
It'll take me two weeks
to clean up!

905
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:29,116
You have no idea, do you?

906
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,200
Yes, I do.

907
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:33,662
I'm formulating this
gruesome plan in my head...

908
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:36,164
Makes me sick
just thinking about it.

909
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:37,875
You... You just wait.

910
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:41,503
Until then, why don't you
just hang around?

911
00:57:41,587 --> 00:57:42,588
Good one, huh?

912
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:52,472
Huh?

913
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:55,267
A little one?

914
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:56,852
All right!

915
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:58,270
Phew! Good work, Captain Boun!

916
00:57:58,437 --> 00:57:59,438
- Fang's here!
- What?

917
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:02,941
People of Spine,
we are hunting for Raya,

918
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:04,860
a fugitive from Heart!

919
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:07,279
Send her out,
or we're coming in!

920
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:11,325
You're the only one here?

921
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:14,786
My people battled the Druun
with much valor,

922
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:16,121
but lost.

923
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:26,590
Okay.

924
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,884
But the Fang gang's here
for me, not for you,

925
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:30,677
so, um,
if I can distract them,

926
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:32,012
then you guys
can get out of here.

927
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,680
You're gonna fight
an entire army?

928
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:35,349
No, I'm just gonna stall them.

929
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:37,476
Look, I know how to push
Namaari's buttons.

930
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:40,145
And once you guys are clear,
I'm out of there.

931
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:46,235
What's your name?

932
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:48,570
The moniker given to me
is Tong.

933
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:50,656
Okay, Tong, look,
you don't know me,

934
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:51,740
and I don't know you,

935
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:53,742
but I'm sure that
you know a back door

936
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:54,826
or a way outta here,

937
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:57,788
and it's really important that
my friends stay safe, okay?

938
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:01,917
So, I am sincerely asking you,
will you help us?

939
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:04,044
Please.

940
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,097
Okay.

941
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,182
Note to self,

942
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:18,809
don't die.

943
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:21,019
Burn them out.

944
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,696
Hey there, Princess Undercut.

945
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:31,864
Fancy meeting you here.

946
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,407
You
and the Dragon Gem pieces

947
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,616
are coming with me.

948
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,952
Hmm.
My sword here says we're not.

949
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:41,540
Yeah, I knew you couldn't
handle rolling solo.

950
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,667
You're nothing
without your band.

951
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:45,711
Stand down.

952
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:48,046
This shouldn't take long.

953
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:13,614
Did you need that, dep la?

954
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,491
Nah.

955
01:00:16,575 --> 01:00:19,494
Looks like somebody's
been taking classes.

956
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,220
Why are you stealing
gem pieces?

957
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:43,227
Oh, I'm just
trying to get a matching set.

958
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,193
You didn't happen
to bring Fang's gem, did you?

959
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:03,413
No? Never mind.

960
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,250
I'll just swing by
and grab it later.

961
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:10,045
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

962
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:40,325
Yep, she's a dragon.

963
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:41,660
Let's go.

964
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:42,828
Come on!

965
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,728
Did you just hit me
with a shrimp tail?

966
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,273
When were you gonna tell us
she was Sisu?

967
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,775
Well, technically,
you always knew she was Sisu.

968
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:15,527
Seriously?

969
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:17,196
Why are you here,

970
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:18,906
divine water dragon?

971
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,532
Isn't that obvious, big guy?

972
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:22,701
My girl Raya and I
are gonna fix the world.

973
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:24,203
Bring everyone back.

974
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:26,038
You're gonna
bring everyone back?

975
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,122
I wanna help.

976
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:30,584
I'm sorry,
I can't let you do that.

977
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:31,877
It's too dangerous.

978
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,714
You're not the only one
who lost family to the Druun.

979
01:02:39,468 --> 01:02:40,469
Please.

980
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,346
Let me help you.

981
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:53,106
I too wish to join
this fellowship

982
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,484
of Druun butt-kickery!

983
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:10,040
My big brother Pengu's magic.

984
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:18,400
All right, Captain Boun.
To Fang.

985
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:19,776
You got it!

986
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:40,839
All right, everyone,
here's the plan.

987
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:43,008
The last gem piece is in Fang,

988
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:45,928
the most heavily guarded
of the five lands.

989
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,180
Now, they're protected
by an artificial canal

990
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:50,641
that separates them
from the rest of the world.

991
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,351
The only way in or out

992
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:53,977
is by water.

993
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:02,694
Luckily for us,
we have a magic water dragon.

994
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:07,115
Now, the palace will be
swarmingwith Fang soldiers.

995
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:09,034
To sneak past them,
we'll need to...

996
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:10,452
I got this, guys.

997
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:12,037
I'll take care
of the first wave.

998
01:05:14,206 --> 01:05:15,207
Tong will follow up

999
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,209
with hisgiant axe
of bad-axery.

1000
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:21,046
And then come the ongis
and that crazy con-baby...

1001
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:26,134
...who will toss the gem
to the Mighty Sisudatu.

1002
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:30,472
And then, bye-bye, binturis.

1003
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,895
Super flow plan, am I right?

1004
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:40,065
Uh, no. Yeah, that's not flow.
That's a clog.

1005
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:41,149
I agree.

1006
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,734
Here's my plan.

1007
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:44,444
We infiltrate Fang,

1008
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:46,113
confront Namaari,

1009
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:49,533
and offer her something nice
and go...

1010
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,702
Hey! Wanna help us
save the world?

1011
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:54,621
Because all it takes
is one gem piece.

1012
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:56,081
Yes!

1013
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:57,875
I've been waiting
for someone to ask me!

1014
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,168
Here you go!

1015
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:01,837
Best friends forever!

1016
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:06,800
Yeah, I think I'd rather
go with Boun's plan.

1017
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:07,885
What?

1018
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:08,969
Yes!

1019
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,053
What, why?

1020
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:11,346
Because it's Fang.

1021
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,640
Their blades
are specially designed

1022
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:15,517
for the stabbing of backs.

1023
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:16,727
If it weren't for them,

1024
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,020
none of this
would have happened.

1025
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:19,730
They're the worst.

1026
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,108
If we're just honest with her,

1027
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:24,693
deep down, I got a feeling

1028
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:26,486
she wants to fix the world
as much as we do.

1029
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:28,572
You weren't there
when Namaari betrayed me.

1030
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:30,699
We're sticking with my plan.

1031
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:36,079
Whoa. Uh...
What's with the downpour?

1032
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:37,998
Come on!
I need to show you something.

1033
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,088
So, what do we do now?

1034
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,590
I don't know.

1035
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:49,384
Where are you taking me?

1036
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:18,413
Sisu, why did you
bring me here?

1037
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:20,123
This is where it all happened.

1038
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:22,251
Yeah, I know.

1039
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,546
- I was there.
- No.

1040
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,842
This is where it all happened
500 years ago.

1041
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:38,892
I want you to meet
my brothers and sisters.

1042
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:40,894
The real mighty ones.

1043
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:43,146
I miss them.

1044
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,649
I never knew
they were here.

1045
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,695
See that classy-looking one
over there?

1046
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,906
That's Amba.
I get my glow from her.

1047
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:56,243
And that's Pranee.
She's a shapeshifter.

1048
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:58,704
Jagan, fog.

1049
01:07:59,705 --> 01:08:01,540
And Pengu.

1050
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:03,959
He's our big brother.

1051
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,503
He brings the rain.

1052
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:09,798
We were the last dragons.

1053
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:15,053
All the other dragons
had been turned to stone.

1054
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:18,015
We were drowning
in a sea of Druun.

1055
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:25,731
But my oldest brother Pengu
refused to accept defeat.

1056
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,026
This is where
we'd make our last stand...

1057
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:31,403
united.

1058
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:37,784
So, one by one,

1059
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:41,038
they combined all their magic,

1060
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:44,208
creating the Dragon Gem.

1061
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:51,089
I don't know why
they chose me.

1062
01:08:52,174 --> 01:08:54,176
It could have been any of us.

1063
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:58,472
All I know

1064
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:00,641
is I trusted them...

1065
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:04,144
...and they trusted me.

1066
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:07,981
And so...

1067
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:20,160
When they put their faith
in me,

1068
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:23,622
it empowered me beyond
anything I could imagine.

1069
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:26,291
The same can happen
with Namaari.

1070
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,378
I really wish
I could believe that.

1071
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:32,172
I once thought
that we could be friends.

1072
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:33,549
After all this,

1073
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:35,384
maybe you can be.

1074
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:38,428
Even if she wanted to help us,

1075
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:40,848
how could I possibly
trust her?

1076
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:42,975
But if somehow you could,

1077
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:44,935
you wouldn't just bring
your ba back.

1078
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:47,229
You'd also bring back
his dream.

1079
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:48,939
Kumandra.

1080
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,132
Do you think
he would even recognize me?

1081
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,843
So much has changed.

1082
01:10:20,137 --> 01:10:21,763
Of course he will.

1083
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,099
You remind me of him.

1084
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,143
Oh, yeah? Strong?

1085
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:28,145
Good-looking
with impeccable hair?

1086
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,608
Hopeful.

1087
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,072
How would I even
approach Namaari

1088
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:40,657
after all that's happened?

1089
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:45,078
It may feel impossible,
but sometimes,

1090
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,997
you just have to take
the first step,

1091
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,248
even before you're ready.

1092
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,292
Trust me.

1093
01:10:58,884 --> 01:11:01,011
Okay. We'll go with your plan.

1094
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:03,805
What? My plan?
You're gonna go with my plan?

1095
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:06,433
- Yeah.
- All right!

1096
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,851
You're not gonna regret this.

1097
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:09,520
But we're gonna need
a really good gift.

1098
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:11,855
What do you think she's into?
Cats? Knives?

1099
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:13,440
Cats with knives?

1100
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:14,775
Knives with little cats
on them?

1101
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:18,529
Actually, I know exactly what
to give her.

1102
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:27,329
And that is how
the land of Fang rose

1103
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:31,083
in spite of all the monsters
that wanted to destroy us.

1104
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,711
Because we're smart, resilient,

1105
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,505
and we take care of one another.

1106
01:11:36,672 --> 01:11:38,423
Mother! We need to talk.

1107
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:39,716
It's Princess Namaari!

1108
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,595
All right, all right,
now, run along, kittens.

1109
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,973
I have to speak with the princess.

1110
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:48,600
Mother, you won't believe what I saw.

1111
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:50,394
You saw a dragon.

1112
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:52,980
General Atitāya informed me

1113
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:55,524
that you'd be returning home
without the gem pieces.

1114
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:57,150
It was Sisu.

1115
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:59,319
She can fix what we broke.

1116
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:00,904
She can bring everyone back.

1117
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:03,407
And that's what scares me.

1118
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:05,284
When everyone comes back,

1119
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:07,202
who do you think
they'll come for?

1120
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:08,328
You forget.

1121
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:10,747
The other lands blame us
for what's happened.

1122
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:13,458
But we... We never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

1123
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:17,004
Yes, but if we had the dragon

1124
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:18,964
and the gem pieces,

1125
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:21,008
we would be forgiven.

1126
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:22,676
We could save the world.

1127
01:12:22,843 --> 01:12:25,971
But more importantly,
our people would remain safe.

1128
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:28,682
But Raya isn't just gonna
give Sisu to us.

1129
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,768
We're not going to give her
a choice.

1130
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:34,229
What are you going to do?

1131
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:36,690
That's no longer
your concern, my love.

1132
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:38,525
You've done enough.

1133
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:51,163
If she refuses to help,

1134
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,415
we've just flushed
our tactical advantage

1135
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:55,459
- into the dung pot.
- I know.

1136
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:57,503
Yeah. She really has no reason
to help us.

1137
01:12:57,586 --> 01:12:58,587
I know!

1138
01:12:58,670 --> 01:12:59,880
This jerky's terrible.

1139
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:00,964
I know!

1140
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:03,217
Are you sure
those four miniature menaces

1141
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,301
will be successful?

1142
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,887
I don't know.

1143
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:19,942
Huh?

1144
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:27,741
Hmm?

1145
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,102
Huh?

1146
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:22,337
There's too much spice.

1147
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,047
Uh, no.
There's too much bamboo.

1148
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:25,215
What do you know?

1149
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:26,508
You have the taste buds
of a tall baby.

1150
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:28,302
Well, you dress like
a tall baby.

1151
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:29,970
Give me the spoon!
I'm taking over!

1152
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:32,264
Back off, tidal wave.
I'm the professional here.

1153
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:33,724
May I?

1154
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:39,104
Whoa!

1155
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:40,189
That's good.

1156
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:42,232
It's just a little
something my ba showed me.

1157
01:14:42,316 --> 01:14:43,859
Aw. Did he also show you

1158
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:45,569
how to make
that delicious jerky?

1159
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:47,821
No, that was all me.

1160
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:53,160
It'll be nice to share a meal
with him again.

1161
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:54,578
I know what you mean.

1162
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:57,206
I have this really
obnoxious sister

1163
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:58,874
who always tousles my hair.

1164
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,002
I can't wait to see her
the most.

1165
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:03,712
After we win the day,

1166
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:06,256
I look forward
to filling my eyeball

1167
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:11,678
with the joytastic image
of my village full again.

1168
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:17,434
And you will be reunited
with your family, Noi.

1169
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:19,811
Uh, what did you
just call her?

1170
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:21,313
Noi. It's her name.

1171
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:23,982
It's written on her collar.

1172
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:26,068
Have none of you ever checked?

1173
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:28,487
And they think of me
as the ruffian.

1174
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:34,034
What's that mean?

1175
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,160
It means we're on.

1176
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:37,329
Sisu,

1177
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:38,705
until we get that gem

1178
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:41,250
and confirm Namaari's actually
on our side,

1179
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,544
promise me you'll stay hidden.

1180
01:15:58,267 --> 01:16:00,143
I see you got my gift.

1181
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,313
I never thought
I'd see this again.

1182
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,982
Well, uh...

1183
01:16:05,148 --> 01:16:06,900
I tried to take
good care of it.

1184
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,197
You're not the only
dragon nerd here.

1185
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:34,428
The final piece.

1186
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,513
Time to bring everyone back.

1187
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:44,938
Sisu and the gem pieces
are coming with me.

1188
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:46,773
- Sisu!
- Stay back!

1189
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,484
It was foolish
to trust someone from Fang!

1190
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:50,986
Don't come any closer!

1191
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:52,154
Namaari,

1192
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:54,531
it doesn't have to be
like this.

1193
01:16:54,698 --> 01:16:57,284
I don't have any other choice.

1194
01:16:57,951 --> 01:17:01,079
Hey. I got this.

1195
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:11,465
I know you don't wanna
hurt anybody.

1196
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:12,966
What are you doing?

1197
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:15,135
You just want a better world.

1198
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:17,179
Like we all do.

1199
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:19,223
Sisu...

1200
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:22,559
I trust you, Namaari.

1201
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:39,076
No!

1202
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:43,580
Sisu!

1203
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,296
No...

1204
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,355
What's happening?

1205
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:10,315
I don't know.

1206
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:13,318
It appears that
with the last dragon gone,

1207
01:18:13,402 --> 01:18:14,987
so too goes the water.

1208
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,740
Now there is nothing
to stop the Druun.

1209
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,243
Nothing.

1210
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:33,589
Raya?

1211
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:35,841
Where's Raya?

1212
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,336
Namaari!

1213
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:15,547
Let's finish this, binturi.

1214
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:43,367
Raya!

1215
01:19:50,249 --> 01:19:51,708
She cannot see us.

1216
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,711
Raya's blinded
by her own rage.

1217
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:58,173
The gem's powers are fading!

1218
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,760
All these people
are Druun food

1219
01:20:01,844 --> 01:20:02,970
if we don't get them out.

1220
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:09,393
Come on!
Trust me, it's gonna be okay.

1221
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:12,813
Stupid Druun! Out of my way!

1222
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,231
Go, go, go!

1223
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:17,484
Up we go! Yep!

1224
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:29,079
Go, go! Hurry!

1225
01:20:29,413 --> 01:20:32,249
Get to the water!
Keep going! Keep going!

1226
01:20:36,086 --> 01:20:38,088
Come on! Come on!

1227
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,220
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

1228
01:21:26,386 --> 01:21:27,596
Liar!

1229
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:31,099
I don't care
if you believe me.

1230
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:32,935
Sisu did.

1231
01:21:34,478 --> 01:21:35,979
But you didn't trust her.

1232
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:39,149
That's why we're here.

1233
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:41,818
Do whatever you want.

1234
01:21:42,486 --> 01:21:45,614
But you're as much to blame
for Sisu's death as I am.

1235
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:56,583
Tong, there's still
people back there!

1236
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,293
Hurry!
We're running out of time!

1237
01:21:58,377 --> 01:21:59,419
Got it!

1238
01:21:59,503 --> 01:22:01,755
Everyone, out! Come with me!

1239
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:38,083
Okay, Tuk,
these are the last of 'em.

1240
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,960
Go! We're right behind you.

1241
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:42,462
Tuk Tuk!

1242
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:47,050
What are you waiting for? Go!

1243
01:22:54,766 --> 01:22:56,018
Raya!

1244
01:22:57,186 --> 01:22:59,730
It's the one who slayed Sisu!

1245
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:14,161
Raya! Raya!

1246
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:16,205
The gem's magic,
it's almost gone!

1247
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:18,040
They aren't backing off!

1248
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:19,750
They're everywhere!

1249
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:46,276
I don't know why
they chose me.

1250
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:49,238
It could have been any of us.

1251
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:53,116
All I know is I trusted them,

1252
01:23:53,659 --> 01:23:55,452
and they trusted me.

1253
01:23:56,286 --> 01:23:57,746
And so...

1254
01:24:00,624 --> 01:24:02,251
Everyone, give me your gems.

1255
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:04,711
We can still put it together.
It can still work.

1256
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:07,422
Sisu's gone, Raya!
We don't have her magic!

1257
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:10,384
It's not about her magic.
It's about trust.

1258
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:11,510
What?

1259
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:14,346
That's why it worked.
That's why we can do it, too.

1260
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:17,474
By doing the one thing
Sisu wanted us to do.

1261
01:24:17,641 --> 01:24:19,685
What my ba wanted us to do.

1262
01:24:19,852 --> 01:24:22,729
To finally trust each other
and fix this.

1263
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:26,400
But we have to come together.

1264
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:27,734
Please.

1265
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:29,695
After what she's done?

1266
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,238
We'll never trust her!

1267
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:38,745
Then let me take
the first step.

1268
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,175
Raya! No!

1269
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:14,545
It worked! It worked!

1270
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:02,509
Tuk Tuk!

1271
01:29:03,135 --> 01:29:04,219
Oh!

1272
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,423
Pranee! Amba!

1273
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:24,633
Jagan!

1274
01:30:24,842 --> 01:30:26,468
Pengu!

1275
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:28,929
Yeah!

1276
01:31:00,252 --> 01:31:01,253
Raya.

1277
01:31:02,462 --> 01:31:03,630
Sisu.

1278
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:07,885
I am so hungry.

1279
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:09,887
I got some jerky.

1280
01:31:10,429 --> 01:31:11,638
Not that hungry.

1281
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:22,524
Sisu!

1282
01:31:22,608 --> 01:31:26,862
Aw, it's good to breathe in
your glorious dragon stench again.

1283
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:28,572
Okay, I take that
as a compliment.

1284
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:19,957
Momma!

1285
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,542
My baby!

1286
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:26,171
Mom, look, it's Boun!

1287
01:32:28,298 --> 01:32:29,424
It's Boun!

1288
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:10,132
Ba?

1289
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:16,263
Dewdrop?

1290
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:20,058
Ba!

1291
01:33:37,284 --> 01:33:38,744
Is that really her?

1292
01:33:42,706 --> 01:33:46,502
Chief Benja,
your daughter did you proud.

1293
01:33:47,294 --> 01:33:50,255
Hope you don't mind,
she brought some friends.

1294
01:34:18,909 --> 01:34:20,536
Ba?

1295
01:34:21,203 --> 01:34:23,956
Welcome to Kumandra.

1296
01:35:17,176 --> 01:35:19,011
We have a choice

1297
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:21,346
To build or destroy

1298
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:26,185
To fight or to come together

1299
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:28,478
Love is a bridge

1300
01:35:28,562 --> 01:35:30,898
And trust is a gift

1301
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:36,195
We give it
And it gets better

1302
01:35:36,278 --> 01:35:38,655
There's an energy
in the water

1303
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:41,033
There is magic
deep in our heart

1304
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:43,285
There's a legacy
that we honor

1305
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:45,621
When we bring
the light to the dark

1306
01:35:45,704 --> 01:35:48,248
Whatever brings us together

1307
01:35:48,332 --> 01:35:50,626
Can never tear us apart

1308
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:53,086
We become stronger than ever

1309
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:55,005
When we just trust

1310
01:35:55,088 --> 01:35:57,799
Trust and believe it
You'll see that

1311
01:35:57,883 --> 01:35:59,718
We’ll lead the way
When we just trust

1318
01:36:13,774 --> 01:36:15,275
When you're broken

1319
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:17,986
Open up your heart and feel

1320
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:22,574
There's no difference
We're all family here

1321
01:36:23,116 --> 01:36:25,452
Despite all of our doubts

1322
01:36:25,536 --> 01:36:27,788
All our up and downs

1323
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:33,085
There's never really
anything to fear

1324
01:36:33,585 --> 01:36:35,796
There's an energy
in the water

1325
01:36:35,879 --> 01:36:37,965
There is magic
deep in our heart

1326
01:36:38,048 --> 01:36:40,551
There's a legacy
that we honor

1327
01:36:40,634 --> 01:36:43,178
When we bring the light
to the dark

1328
01:36:43,262 --> 01:36:45,514
Whatever brings us together

1329
01:36:45,597 --> 01:36:47,766
Can never tear us apart

1330
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:50,269
We become stronger than ever

1331
01:36:50,352 --> 01:36:52,104
When we just trust

1332
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:54,648
Trust and believe it
You'll see that

1333
01:36:54,731 --> 01:36:56,692
We’ll lead the way

01:37:20,924 --> 01:37:22,885
Takin' my first step

1341
01:37:22,968 --> 01:37:25,429
I see you as myself

1342
01:37:25,512 --> 01:37:30,184
Nothing we can't do

1343
01:37:30,267 --> 01:37:32,769
Put the past behind

1344
01:37:32,853 --> 01:37:35,105
Learn from life this time

1345
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:40,110
We can start brand new

1346
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:42,571
There's an energy
in the water

1347
01:37:42,654 --> 01:37:44,948
There is magic
deep in our heart
