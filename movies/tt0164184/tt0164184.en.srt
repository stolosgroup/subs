-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

2
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:24,522
- You sure it's the Russians?
- 100%, sir.

3
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:28,989
Submarine launched 12 to 15
megatons. They went to strike status.

4
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:32,027
The Roosevelt's splashed
six incoming cruise missiles.

5
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,258
The Russians are moving west.
Our Berlin brigade are outnumbered.

6
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:42,105
Sir, we've got a launch from Alyesk,
Central Russia.

7
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,366
What the hell is in Alyesk?

8
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:49,206
SS-1 8 ICBMs. Probable targets:
New York, Washington, here.

9
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,975
- How good is this ceiling?
- Anything but a direct hit.

10
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:56,484
Satellites confirm birds in the air,
first impact estimated 25 minutes.

11
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,713
- Is that accurate?
- It's accurate.

12
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:02,121
- I advise we go to DEFCON-1.
- Get President Zorkin on the hotline.

13
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:05,785
Zorkin is missing. We have reports
of a coup in Moscow.

14
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,831
General Bulgakov
is calling the shots now.

15
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,059
Who the hell is Bulgakov?

16
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,932
The asshole who wanted
to use nukes in Chechnya.

17
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,646
Sir, DEFCON-1. We're out of time.

18
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:38,826
Do it.

19
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,963
Mr President.

20
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:47,502
It'll take a minute for the launch
to process after you give the order.

21
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:51,005
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed.

22
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,474
My ID number is fifth from the top.

23
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,314
- Sir, it's your wife on 21 04.
- Thank you.

24
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:05,988
- Yeah.
- The order must be confirmed

25
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:09,160
- By someone on the approved list.
- Shit.

26
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,856
Gene Revell,
National Security Advisor.

27
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,625
Is it black tie? OK. I'm on my way.

28
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,529
Can we...

29
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,731
...finish this up some other time?

30
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,347
No.

31
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:36,486
We've got to update these fire drills,
Billy.

32
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:39,782
If the shit ever hits the fan,
I'm not going underground.

33
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,358
It's a goddamn tomb down there.

34
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:46,554
We have to choose someone else to
face off against besides the Russians.

35
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:51,293
Really? Let's see. Who else has
27,000 nukes for us to worry about?

36
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:54,063
It's the guy with one I'm worried about.

37
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,639
I have to send some folks to Russia,

38
00:07:56,842 --> 00:08:00,972
inspect their nuclear decommissioning
facility at Armazas.

39
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,580
- Arzamas.
- Yeah, whatever.

40
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:07,650
- Someone from your staff should go.
- I'll go.

41
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:12,287
- Billy, send staff.
- I want to go.

42
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:14,591
OK.

43
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:19,890
Don't underestimate Zorkin. Between
his economy, crime, Chechnya...

44
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:23,465
- His liver.
- What's left of it. How is he?

45
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,072
He's scheduled a press conference
for today, so we know he can sit up.

46
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,806
Chechnya is part of Russia.

47
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:43,343
Only criminals and their friends
in the West who wish it to be separate.

48
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:46,922
Mr President, if you will kindly
come back...

49
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,054
Do you guys see what I see?

50
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,526
- His jacket?
- He used to be able to button it up.

51
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,566
He's getting fat.

52
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,171
I know how he feels.
Oh, wow. Look at that.

53
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:04,001
Maybe it's not the same jacket.

54
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,168
Yeah, it has shiny sleeves. He wore it
the last time he got out of the hospital.

55
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,907
- He's off the diet.
- And off the wagon. He slurred...

56
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:17,486
That must be why Cherlinski is there,
to keep him off the sauce.

57
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:18,986
Where's Cherlinski?

58
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:23,457
Next to... What's her name?
The chick with the brown hair.

59
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:26,631
- Elena Rishkov.
- That is not Cherlinski.

60
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:29,598
Bzz! Busted. It's Cherlinski.

61
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:32,031
You're thinking Cherpitski. It ain't him.

62
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:35,331
- I know. It's Cherlinski.
- No, it's not. Trust me.

63
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,909
He's next to Elena Rishkov. He was
banging her at the Geneva summit.

64
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,081
Cherlinski was not at Geneva.
Cherpitski was.

65
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,682
Cherpitski was banging Elena Rishkov?

66
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:51,446
I just said Zorkin's putting on weight.
Why reduce it to sex? It's disgusting.

67
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,956
I agree. Write it up.
If he is putting on weight,

68
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,358
that might have health consequences,
so get it in the afternoon brief.

69
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:04,697
Oh, and somebody find out who is
banging Elena Rishkov. This is good.

70
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,370
What shall we make of Chechnya
asking the West for protection?

71
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:19,141
She is like a beautiful virgin, escaping
the clutches of a lecherous bear,

72
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:22,650
and running to Bill Clinton
to save her maidenhood.

73
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:29,858
A poet once wrote, "Meet the new
boss, same as the old boss."

74
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,597
He could have been writing of us,
of Europe in the 21st century.

75
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,862
Over 50 years of America and Russia

76
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,838
imposing their will
on the European community,

77
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:46,602
East and West,

78
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,111
and we're still treated like children...

79
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:55,383
...but without the toys
or the goodnight chocolates.

80
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:57,782
Each day we lose a little bit more

81
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:02,983
of our separate sovereign ability
to determine our own futures

82
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:07,598
and each day the world comes just a
little bit closer to that terrible moment

83
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,964
when the beating of a butterfly's wings
unleashes a hurricane...

84
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:16,198
...God himself cannot stop.

85
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:53,167
So what is it?

86
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:56,143
Are you blind?

87
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:57,745
It's a bomb.

88
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,747
Where's the fuse?

89
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:11,125
It's warm.

90
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:15,225
So am I. Come on.
I don't have all night.

91
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,756
It's a dud.

92
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,064
Let's get it on the truck.

93
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,328
But how can we sell it now?

94
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,097
There's always someone
who'll buy this crap.

95
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:11,448
I cannot stand all these questions
about my health.

96
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:17,654
I am to be described as
"robust" and "healthy".

97
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,382
Is that yours or mine?

98
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:44,347
It must be yours. Mine's just for show.

99
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:54,522
It's not the hospital.

100
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,628
- Hi.
- You're still here.

101
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:04,538
Well, I think to be accurate,
it's actually you who's still here.

102
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,509
Oh, right.

103
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,846
Not that I'm complaining.

104
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,817
Jack...

105
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,959
I know this is new and all, but...

106
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,623
...I have something I have to say
or I'm going to explode.

107
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:29,561
I don't want you to be scared.

108
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:33,300
What?

109
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,636
You're in love with me.

110
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:51,578
Jack, I'm a medical professional.
I can read the symptoms.

111
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,156
You're definitely in love with me.

112
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,320
And that scares you?

113
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,566
Not even a little.

114
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:05,602
But I think it scares you.

115
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,238
No, not even a little.

116
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,867
And for the record,
you're the one who brought it up.

117
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,552
Forget it.

118
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,779
- I'm gonna get it.
- No way. It'll stop.

119
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,828
I don't know who this is.

120
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:36,058
- Just go about your business.
- The timing sucks.

121
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,565
Do what you have to do. I understand.

122
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,829
Yes, this is Dr Muller.

123
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,038
Muller. You paged me.

124
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,608
Hello.

125
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,673
Stop! Yes, this is Jack Ryan.

126
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:54,484
Jesus.

127
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,887
OK. I'll be there in half an hour.

128
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,917
I gotta go. I have an emergency
at work.

129
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,993
I have to go. I'm sorry.

130
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,997
Cathy, how about dinner tonight?

131
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,633
Yeah.

132
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:14,202
- How about tomorrow night?
- Jack, I said yes to tonight.

133
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,667
I know.

134
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,037
What kind of emergency
does a historian have?

135
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:28,982
He died at 0420 Zulu. 81/21/21/2 hours
later, they swore in a new president.

136
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:32,315
- Who is he?
- Alexander Nemerov.

137
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,153
You're kidding. I wrote a paper
about him a year ago.

138
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:40,525
- I said he could be the next guy.
- I know.

139
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,723
- Nobody read it.
- They're reading it now.

140
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,925
- Who?
- Cabot.

141
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:47,764
I've been here 1 4 months.
He doesn't know what I look...

142
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:55,437
- Are you Ryan?
- Yes, sir.

143
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,275
What is this? "The Paper Chase"?

144
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:07,989
- Sir, my...
- Come on, we're late.

145
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:17,566
You're about to breathe air that's way
over your pay grade, so listen.

146
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:22,297
You'll be asked for advice. Be sure
you know what you're talking about.

147
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:24,702
Don't be afraid to say you don't know.

148
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:28,003
Choose your words carefully.
They could become policy.

149
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,909
Hey, you. Give me your coat.

150
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,448
Come on, you'll get it back.

151
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,654
Tie.

152
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:48,365
So, intelligence committee?

153
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:54,435
I've watched these on C-SPAN.
Never actually been to one.

154
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,367
You've never watched
one of these on C-SPAN.

155
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:23,962
Our most important assessment comes
from a source inside the Kremlin.

156
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:28,401
In his opinion, Nemerov does not owe
his ascension to the military.

157
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:31,632
Everyone has opinions, Mr Cabot.

158
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:33,674
I respect that.

159
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:38,144
This morning, my wife woke up
and said I was old, bald and ugly.

160
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,079
Is that a question, Mr Chairman?

161
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,788
I told her
appearances aren't everything.

162
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,857
- Would you agree?
- I certainly would.

163
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,326
Now, this new fellow, Nezmeroz.
Is that his name?

164
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,259
Nemerov, sir.

165
00:18:56,467 --> 00:19:00,904
Despite what your source says,
we hear that Nezmeroz is a hardliner.

166
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:03,232
Is he a hardliner?

167
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:04,738
No.

168
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,673
It's too soon to make that assessment.

169
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:09,506
According to CNN,

170
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:16,745
your Mr Nezmeroz is making promises
to rebuild the Russian empire.

171
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,719
That sounds pretty rash
from where I sit.

172
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:23,223
If I were sitting in Chechnya,
I'd be even more worried.

173
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,958
Sir, Nemerov only said that
to get the hardliners off his back.

174
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,862
If we leave him alone,
Russia will stabilize.

175
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,564
When I asked for your advice, I didn't
mean that you should actually speak.

176
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:39,038
Mr Cabot?

177
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:44,147
Some of our assets in the Russian
government who know Mr Nemerov

178
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,249
have not had a chance to report in.

179
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,818
I'd like to take a couple of days
and gather more information for you

180
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:52,421
before characterizing him,

181
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,560
but I do maintain my opinion
that appearances can be deceiving.

182
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,020
You're saying I'm wrong?

183
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,798
Absolutely, Mr Chairman.

184
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,034
I don't think you're ugly.

185
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:14,103
- I was out of line. I apologize.
- Senators don't like to be surprised.

186
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:19,079
I hint at what I'm gonna tell them, then
I give them a while to get used to it.

187
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,514
Then I tell them.

188
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:25,018
- I understand.
- Good.

189
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:27,691
But I'm right about Nemerov.

190
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:33,623
Your girlfriend like
this stubborn streak in you?

191
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:35,765
What?

192
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,061
Cathy Muller,
second year surgical resident,

193
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,602
Baltimore Memorial Hospital.

194
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,806
Welcome to the CIA, sport.

195
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,510
Your intelligence is a little flawed.
I wouldn't call her my girlfriend... yet.

196
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,054
- What exactly would you call her?
- Great. Amazing.

197
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:02,158
She's just afraid to commit.

198
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,987
He's terrified of commitment.

199
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:07,562
A man who's afraid of commitment
after three dates? Alert the media.

200
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:10,825
- I know, I know.
- So what does he do?

201
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:14,402
He was in the marines
before he hurt his back.

202
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,039
- Now he's a historian.
- Yawn.

203
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:20,870
No. He works for a think tank
across the river.

204
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,637
Double yawn.

205
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:27,841
All right, Rita. Let's see what you have
to say after we meet him tonight.

206
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:29,747
He's...

207
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,321
...cute?

208
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:38,154
- I have fat fingers.
- Cathy! Cute scale, one to ten.

209
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,298
Oh, God. I don't know.

210
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,266
Twelve.

211
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,206
Ask them where they found this.

212
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:03,686
In the field, in the Golan.

213
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:08,018
There was a lot of fighting there
in 1 973. Did they witness it?

214
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,529
This one says he lost his son.

215
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:21,034
Does he remember,
was there a plane shot down?

216
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,441
Yes, an Israeli jet, destroyed.

217
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,019
This is worthless.

218
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:55,072
But tell him I will give him $400...
because of his son.

219
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,981
Thank... thank you.

220
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:11,521
Thank you.

221
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:16,092
It's not the sort of thing
you find lying around normally.

222
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,355
- Absolutely not.
- How did you come by it?

223
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:24,433
I found her in the attic of an old
mansion house in Glasgow.

224
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:30,665
Your little trip to the attic has got you
a piece worth now about £ 1,000,

225
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:35,403
even in this condition, and had she
been in better condition, even more.

226
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:37,979
A jolly nice find.

227
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,736
In fact, what I thought I'd found
was a garden ornament.

228
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,044
Hello, Cathy?

229
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:22,921
Hi. I'm glad you called. I'm running late.
Can you come a half an hour later?

230
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:26,760
I can't make it. I'm really sorry.

231
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:36,472
- It's a last-minute work thing.
- What's that noise?

232
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,006
I'm calling from a plane.

233
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:45,171
- This just came up. I tried to call you.
- Where are you going?

234
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:50,184
- I can't tell you that.
- Jack.

235
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,219
You can't tell me?

236
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:53,822
Jack.

237
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,789
- Hold on. Yes, sir?
- What are you doing?

238
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,790
I had a date tonight, so I had to cancel.

239
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:05,196
Don't be stupid. Tell her where you're
going. Tell her who you work for.

240
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,031
She'll be impressed.

241
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,534
OK. I work for the CIA.

242
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:19,512
The director asked me to go with him to
Russia to do a nuclear arms inspection.

243
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:24,248
- Hello?
- That is so lame.

244
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:28,983
I swear, we get to inspect to make sure
they're decommissioning their arsenal.

245
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,995
Hello?

246
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,791
Hello?

247
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,833
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

248
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:27,776
Zdravstvuyte, William Cabot.

249
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,578
President Nemerov.

250
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:45,998
Pleasure, sir.

251
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:48,398
May I present Mrs Lathrop.

252
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,164
Mr President.

253
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:53,172
- General Rand.
- Mr President.

254
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:55,709
- Dr Ryan.
- Mr President.

255
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:05,378
You must be the Dr Ryan who's done
such interesting research on me.

256
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,887
You should not be surprised.
We know quite a bit.

257
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:20,260
We know how wrong your report was
that I had many girlfriends in college.

258
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:33,207
I met my wife in my third year and have
not looked at another woman since.

259
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:37,649
I was referring to
the first two years... sir.

260
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:47,455
Where you received
highest honors in English.

261
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:52,826
I like you.

262
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:57,334
Well, in that case, so do I.

263
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:04,175
I apologize for interjecting myself
in your inspection tour,

264
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,476
but I have a message
for President Fowler.

265
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,279
You could just call him on the phone.

266
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:14,618
I would like him to hear it from you,
his friend of many years,

267
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:16,816
who received it personally from me,

268
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:21,794
and saw my expression and the
language of my body as I spoke it.

269
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,626
I understand.

270
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:27,299
Chechnya is an internal affair.

271
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,997
What we do there should be
none of your concern.

272
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:34,976
I will relay the message,
but I don't think he will agree.

273
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:38,637
Some people in my country
will use this issue to weaken me.

274
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,545
Some people in my country say

275
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:45,688
your war in Chechnya
is exactly your weakness.

276
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,251
Chechnya is a nation of criminals.

277
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:52,452
Every day brings another cowardly
attack on innocent Russian citizens.

278
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:54,722
It is none of your concern.

279
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,429
Stability is our concern.

280
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,731
Peace in Chechnya is our concern.

281
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:06,534
And, if I may speak frankly...

282
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:10,706
...your control over your military
concerns us too.

283
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:24,791
For you to get involved here, it's... like
sleeping with another man's wife.

284
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,490
And what you are suggesting
is that afterward

285
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,931
they can all live together
under the same roof.

286
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:40,142
But what really happens is
the betrayed husband buys a gun.

287
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:52,918
- That went well.
- Who's the guy with Nemerov?

288
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:55,683
- Anatoli Grushkov.
- Old KGB?

289
00:29:55,893 --> 00:30:01,024
He's been around since Brezhnev.
Nobody's had the guts to get rid of him.

290
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,200
Because he knows
where the bodies are buried?

291
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,300
He probably buried them himself.

292
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:24,811
And we were able to obtain a roster
of their scientists at Arzamas.

293
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:27,786
Who's who, what their expertise is.

294
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:02,718
Arzamas-1 6 is home

295
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,260
to the All-Russian Scientific Research
Institute of Experimental Physics

296
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:11,560
and is the birthplace
of our first atomic bomb.

297
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:16,970
Many of our greatest scientists
worked here and many still do.

298
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:18,971
Since 1 995,

299
00:31:19,176 --> 00:31:22,839
we have dismantled
over 1 0,000 nuclear devices.

300
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:31,620
We tried so hard to get in here
over the years.

301
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:34,290
I sent three people.

302
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:38,117
They all died trying.

303
00:32:04,688 --> 00:32:07,213
What does the T-shirt say?

304
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,021
"I am a bomb technician. If you
see me running... try to catch up."

305
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,231
OK.

306
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,864
Sir, I'm sorry. Just one quick thing.
I'm sure it's nothing.

307
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:28,636
According to this, there are
1 7 senior scientists on duty today.

308
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,514
I only count 1 4.

309
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:40,255
Doctors Milinov, Orlov and Spassky.
They don't seem to be here.

310
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,727
I will make inquiries.

311
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:47,055
Dr Milinov is out sick.
Orlov is on vacation.

312
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:50,825
Spassky, I'm grieved to say,
was killed

313
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,061
driving his car to work
just this past week.

314
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,509
We move on, shall we?

315
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:03,476
Please.

316
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:10,882
Very impressive. You almost seem
to have that information memorized.

317
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:13,886
I assumed you would ask, Dr Ryan.

318
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,453
We touch down at Andrews at 21 30.
Tell him to meet me there.

319
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,292
Sir? Those three missing scientists.

320
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,695
Milinov's expertise is detonators.

321
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:01,871
Spassky's expertise
is the nuclear core.

322
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:03,733
Orlov is a mathematician

323
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:08,742
whose expertise is the geometry of
high explosives inside a fission bomb.

324
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:12,677
The exact three men you would need
if you wanted to build a bomb.

325
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:15,784
- Grushkov said...
- Grushkov's a liar.

326
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:19,478
Milinov is not sick.
Orlov hardly ever takes a vacation

327
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,252
and Spassky, who's supposed to have
died driving a car, doesn't drive.

328
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:28,764
They have no idea
where these guys are.

329
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,567
I'm dying to ask you how you know.

330
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:41,402
Secure source inside the Kremlin.

331
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,477
Codename Spinnaker.

332
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,672
He gives me stuff, I give him stuff.

333
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:51,287
We keep the back channels open
in hopes of staving off disaster.

334
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:55,549
And speaking of disaster,
did you call your girlfriend yet?

335
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:59,160
No. I don't know how to get out of this.

336
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:05,197
All right. Invite her to the White House
correspondents dinner Sunday night.

337
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:07,893
It's the hottest ticket in town.

338
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:13,200
- Sounds great. How do I get in?
- Trust me.

339
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,723
I'll see you at the car.

340
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:42,833
Still loving your desk job?

341
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,866
Yeah, I am.

342
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:49,409
How's your Russian?

343
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,274
Still works. Why?

344
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:57,176
Three Russian nuclear scientists are
missing. I need to know where they are.

345
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,023
I wasn't doing this any more.

346
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,958
I just need information this time,
Johnny.

347
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:11,828
Your orders are on the plane.
Wheels up at 2330. Have a nice flight.

348
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:26,146
Sunday night, 8.00, at the Hilton. The
tickets are in the name of John Clark.

349
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,878
- You do have a tux?
- Yeah, yes, sir.

350
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:41,821
My beautiful wife, Julie, is from
New Jersey. 1 5 electoral votes.

351
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,291
And is, as you know, half-Jewish,

352
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:50,769
so we'll take Florida's
25 electoral votes and divide by two.

353
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,936
- This is a nice hotel.
- Yeah. Beautiful.

354
00:36:56,146 --> 00:37:00,947
My friend Rita stayed here once.
She said it was... nice.

355
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:06,480
Maybe after dinner we can...

356
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,056
...we can get a room here.

357
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:11,489
I already did.

358
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,357
- You didn't.
- Yes, I did.

359
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:20,863
...I did, on a handful of occasions,
smoke marijuana.

360
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,671
California, 54 electoral votes.

361
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:07,513
At 0600 Moscow time, the Russians
launched a massive artillery strike

362
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:10,915
against Grozny,
the capital of Chechnya.

363
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:15,888
The shells contained an experimental
chemical weapon, a nerve agent.

364
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,790
Saturation, you can see
on the sat photos, took 20 minutes,

365
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,524
after which every person
inside a radius of 1 2 miles

366
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:28,603
was rendered helpless by symptoms
approximating late-stage cerebral palsy.

367
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:31,330
- Oh, my God.
- How many dead?

368
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:35,074
Best guess, 80% .

369
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:41,046
Nemerov launched the biggest attack
in the history of chemical warfare.

370
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:44,982
- Let's talk response.
- The worst thing we can do is nothing.

371
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:49,887
If he gets away with chemical weapons,
what's next? Biological, nuclear?

372
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:54,792
OK. Short of gassing the Kremlin,
what's the strongest response?

373
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:57,694
- We send in peacekeepers.
- Chechnya's not sovereign.

374
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:02,929
They requested recognition, so we
give it. Not full diplomatic, provisional.

375
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,907
Then the Chechens request assistance
and we send in peacekeepers.

376
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,569
- How do you get them in there?
- We fly them in from Turkey.

377
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:16,549
- Over Armenian air space?
- To screw Russia? They won't complain.

378
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:21,521
Let's do it. Nemerov can choke on it.

379
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:23,790
Bill?

380
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:26,628
- Dr Ryan.
- Yes, sir.

381
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,855
What do you think?

382
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,371
Conventional wisdom suggests

383
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:40,475
that Nemerov is playing
the traditional Russian role:

384
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:44,636
be aggressive, flex your muscles,
dare the world to stop you.

385
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:48,340
- But Nemerov isn't conventional.
- He acts like a hardliner.

386
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,952
With respect, I don't think he is one.

387
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:55,614
He just gassed the capital of another
country. With respect, you're wrong.

388
00:39:55,826 --> 00:40:00,991
- So what are we wasting our time for?
- What if he didn't order the attack?

389
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:06,232
What if Nemerov
didn't order the attack?

390
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:11,765
What if it was a... a rogue general?

391
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:16,071
Or a military unit frustrated they
couldn't get the rebels out of the city?

392
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:21,410
Have you reason to believe he didn't
order it, or are you just floating this?

393
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:24,576
You don't know.

394
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:33,454
I don't think he did it, sir.
I would bet he didn't do it.

395
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,366
Will senior staff remain behind
for a few minutes, please?

396
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:06,588
Russia's newly-installed president,
Alexander Nemerov,

397
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:12,234
has just begun to address the state.
We join him in progress.

398
00:41:16,406 --> 00:41:20,001
For ten years now,
we have contended...

399
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,236
Excuse me. Could you turn that up?

400
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:26,611
...toward innocent Russian citizens.

401
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,051
Finally...

402
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:34,749
...every nation has a right
to defend itself.

403
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,356
This terrorism must end.

404
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:44,697
The bombing of Chechnya...
was my decision.

405
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,597
Nice going, ace.

406
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:04,117
Who did it?

407
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,722
General Pildysh, General Mitkin.
Unhappy old Communists.

408
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,755
Bastards.

409
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,020
- Relieve them of command.
- I will shoot them myself.

410
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,460
Just disappear them.

411
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:19,965
Their execution would tell the world
I didn't have control.

412
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:25,369
These days, better to appear guilty
than impotent.

413
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:31,344
How is our Russian friend
affected by this?

414
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:39,987
I am not affected.
I remain devoted to our little plan.

415
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:44,392
At what you're charging us,
I am not surprised.

416
00:42:44,594 --> 00:42:48,052
- And the American?
- Mr Mason is a believer.

417
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:51,996
I put a little extra
in the escrow account for him.

418
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:56,639
- Why?
- He won't live long enough to get it.

419
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,901
- Where is the package?
- It left Haifa a week ago.

420
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,706
I'm told these things can kill you.

421
00:43:08,351 --> 00:43:11,650
But so much has changed.

422
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:19,484
Perhaps the new situation suggests
we consider... a different approach?

423
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:26,732
Maybe try to bring Russia
more into Europe,

424
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:29,905
more into our way of thinking?

425
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:33,439
We have discussed that,
Monsieur Monceau,

426
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:36,771
and with your concurrence, rejected it.

427
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,143
Oh. Perhaps we were hasty.

428
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,478
- Perhaps our plan is...
- Is what?

429
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:50,820
Not perfectly conceived.

430
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:58,633
Are you crazy? All over
the world, right-wing parties,

431
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:03,704
nationalist movements,
Nazis, Aryan Nations,

432
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:07,035
all working together for the first time.

433
00:44:07,243 --> 00:44:09,040
Is that not perfect?

434
00:44:16,686 --> 00:44:21,646
Well, I respect the will and judgment
of my friends.

435
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:26,486
But in light of the week's events,
I am grown...

436
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,632
...uncomfortable with this plan.

437
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,361
So I must... beg your leave.

438
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,071
Gentlemen.

439
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,775
Herr Haft will help you out.

440
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,950
Your scarf, monsieur.

441
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,442
Watch it with that thing.
You're gonna kill somebody.

442
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,166
Yo, what's up, Mason?

443
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:54,580
You know, I always wanted to ask
you... Where'd you get that tat, man?

444
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:58,951
The navy.

445
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:01,589
The navy? I was in the navy.

446
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:06,028
Hospital ship, six years. You?

447
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,696
Eight months.

448
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,668
Oh. You wash out?

449
00:46:21,544 --> 00:46:23,808
All right, brother.
You have a good one.

450
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,950
Yeah, brother.

451
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:41,425
...not realizing the rest of the world is
watching and will take a cue from us...

452
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:45,123
The unprecedented attack
on Chechnya

453
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:49,237
signals a dangerous
and troubling shift in Russian policy.

454
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:54,206
It demands the toughest and most
unambiguous response from the West.

455
00:46:55,078 --> 00:47:00,175
NATO forces are on their way to
Chechnya to serve as peacekeepers

456
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:06,219
and to provide humanitarian aid
to victims of this monstrous...

457
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:11,419
I expected this.

458
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,323
Really?

459
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:20,401
What will you do?

460
00:47:20,603 --> 00:47:22,833
Nothing.

461
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,770
We will do nothing.

462
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:33,105
These are four hours old. Russian
12th, 15th and 2nd tank regiments.

463
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:35,546
Why haven't they moved?

464
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,778
- Nemerov's too smart to move them.
- He speaks.

465
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:44,255
Jack, Nemerov's got, like, 1 9,000
tanks. No way NATO can match that.

466
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,792
That's why he's not gonna move them.

467
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:50,989
It's like chess.
He's thinking three moves ahead.

468
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,466
The NATO playbook says we can only
stop him with tactical nuclear weapons.

469
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:59,233
And he won't risk a nuclear war
over this.

470
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:05,845
I also think he's sending us
a message. He didn't bomb Grozny.

471
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:19,795
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mrs Spassky.

472
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:22,521
At the end of the corridor.

473
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:31,799
I haven't seen Sasha since university.

474
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:37,173
And you were his teaching assistant?
Strange, I don't remember you.

475
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,976
When he heard I was in Arzamas,
he asked me to look in on you.

476
00:48:45,254 --> 00:48:49,554
- He says he'll take me to the West.
- That would require a lot of money.

477
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:53,991
Just because the imbeciles here pay
him nothing doesn't mean others won't.

478
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:57,166
He has a secret job.

479
00:48:58,234 --> 00:48:59,963
For the government?

480
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:02,296
For imbeciles with money.

481
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:08,335
Same nonsense, do this, don't do that.

482
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:10,774
They even told him
not to call his mother.

483
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:13,042
The pigs.

484
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:17,811
I could die any day
and he can't phone his mother.

485
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:22,253
But my Sasha, he called.

486
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,585
Just last night.

487
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:34,903
Clark got us her number. NSA traced
calls to that number back to here.

488
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:40,235
It's an abandoned Soviet army base
on the Kremenchug reservoir.

489
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:46,542
What are three Russian atomic
scientists doing in Ukraine?

490
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,148
A fair guess, they're building a bomb.

491
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:54,983
Nemerov has thousands of bombs.
Why would he build a secret one?

492
00:49:55,191 --> 00:49:57,091
Deniability.

493
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:03,332
Build one nobody knows about, he can
drive it to Chechnya in his Beemer.

494
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,229
No way to track it, no way to trace it.

495
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:10,636
He could set it off and say,
"I didn't do it."

496
00:50:11,974 --> 00:50:14,534
With respect, I don't think
that adds up.

497
00:50:14,744 --> 00:50:19,147
It adds up. You just don't like
what it adds up to.

498
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:54,713
Ah, the warmth of plutonium decay.

499
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:59,684
It's completely corroded.
At least you're wearing gloves.

500
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:10,397
Anyone want to light up
an American cigarette?

501
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,391
You're crazy.

502
00:51:16,439 --> 00:51:18,236
I'm going out.

503
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,009
The explosive blocks
must be replaced.

504
00:51:25,214 --> 00:51:27,808
Machined to a thousandth
of a millimeter

505
00:51:28,017 --> 00:51:30,850
in a mathematically determined
configuration.

506
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:36,422
- Do we have a bomb?
- First we must analyze the yield...

507
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:39,754
Do we have a bomb?

508
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,090
Yes.

509
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:48,737
Yes, we do.

510
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:08,480
This is a... a test.

511
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,058
Answer it.

512
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,124
- Answer it.
- Are you sure?

513
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,398
Hello?

514
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:25,406
Yes.

515
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:33,045
Yes, sir.

516
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:41,681
I have to go outside for just a second.

517
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:44,690
OK? I'll be right back.

518
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:47,385
I'll be right back.

519
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:06,648
- Sir, I write reports.
- I reviewed your military records.

520
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:11,115
- You can take care of yourself.
- Yes, sir. But I'm not trained for that.

521
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:17,589
I'm not asking you to be an operations
officer, just my eyes and ears. I can't go.

522
00:53:19,595 --> 00:53:22,655
So... this isn't sanctioned.

523
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:30,902
I want you to give this to Clark,
see what he finds out, bring it home.

524
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:34,606
Yes, sir.

525
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,439
Jack...

526
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,514
...we never had this discussion.

527
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:45,710
What discussion?

528
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:03,500
OK. Clark... So this is
three days ago.

529
00:54:03,706 --> 00:54:07,540
It shows vehicles here.
Guards here and here.

530
00:54:07,743 --> 00:54:09,540
I gotta get one of those.

531
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:15,313
Now, the infrared satellite
took this photograph 34 hours ago.

532
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:18,785
That shows guards here and here.

533
00:54:19,188 --> 00:54:21,486
I don't even have e-mail.

534
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:27,095
There are two at the checkpoint,
between two and five in the barracks

535
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:30,595
and two with the package,
which we believe to be here.

536
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,292
No problem. Give me a couple
of guys, some tranquillizer darts,

537
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:36,403
we can be out in six minutes.

538
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:39,199
- There is a problem.
- What's that?

539
00:54:39,408 --> 00:54:42,844
This is yesterday.
No guards visible at all.

540
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:46,615
Why is that a problem, Mr Ryan?

541
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:51,549
For two reasons. Either we can't
see them, which is bad,

542
00:54:51,754 --> 00:54:53,984
or worse, they left, and we're too late.

543
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:57,088
Suit up.

544
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,921
- What?
- You can't go dressed like that.

545
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:06,128
No, no. I'm an analyst.
I don't go on missions.

546
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:09,827
Relax, 007. It's not a mission.
It's just a recce.

547
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:13,770
OK, fine, whatever you call it.
I don't do that. I just write reports.

548
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:17,537
OK. So write a report about it. Suit up.

549
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,044
Clark, no.

550
00:55:19,782 --> 00:55:22,273
Clark... no.

551
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:28,450
So, Cabot tells me you got my ticket
to the correspondents dinner.

552
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:33,519
Have a good time?
I've never been to one of those.

553
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:36,664
I was actually looking forward to it.

554
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,387
Clark, no. I'm not going in there.

555
00:55:58,587 --> 00:56:02,887
Goddamn right. You're gonna stay here
and make sure no one steals my boat.

556
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:04,889
Be right back.

557
00:58:02,578 --> 00:58:03,806
Damn.

558
00:59:37,439 --> 00:59:39,304
Oh, Jesus.

559
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:42,911
Oh, God. Immigration didn't
call you guys, huh?

560
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,815
I'm sorry. You speak English?
I don't speak much Ukrainian.

561
00:59:54,156 --> 00:59:57,614
It's not what you think. I'm an
American citizen. I have my papers...

562
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,120
OK. No papers.

563
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,855
Please. Just put the gun down.

564
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:08,365
The light? You want
me to put the light down?

565
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:13,400
OK. Take it easy.
I'll put the light down.

566
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:16,067
Here we go, I'm putting it down.

567
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:29,250
Shoot him, Ryan.

568
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:31,592
Shoot him.

569
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,259
Shoot him before he figures out
what I'm saying.

570
01:00:47,142 --> 01:00:50,134
- Get their shoes.
- What?

571
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,837
Tell them to take their shoes off.

572
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:06,818
- You speak Ukrainian.
- Yeah. You don't?

573
01:01:13,502 --> 01:01:18,940
Whatever it is they were spray painting
was big, about the size of a fridge.

574
01:01:19,141 --> 01:01:22,235
The imprint it left was deep.
So we know three things.

575
01:01:22,444 --> 01:01:27,108
It was heavy, something was
radioactive, and now it's gone.

576
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:32,211
- One of them spoke English?
- South African.

577
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:35,447
So, what's a South African
doing in the Ukraine

578
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:38,990
with three Russian scientists
and a crate from Israel?

579
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:48,365
- Tell Cabot I'll call him from Haifa.
- I have a feeling you better hurry.

580
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:57,242
Most people believe the 20th century
was defined by the death struggle

581
01:01:57,446 --> 01:02:00,074
of communism versus capitalism

582
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:03,615
and that fascism was but a hiccup.

583
01:02:04,953 --> 01:02:06,921
Today we know better.

584
01:02:08,557 --> 01:02:13,927
Communism was a fool's errand. The
followers of Marx, gone from this earth.

585
01:02:14,129 --> 01:02:17,621
But the followers of Hitler
abound and thrive.

586
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:22,027
Hitler, however,
had one great disadvantage.

587
01:02:22,237 --> 01:02:25,764
He lived in a time when fascism,
like a virus,

588
01:02:25,974 --> 01:02:28,374
like the AIDS virus,

589
01:02:28,577 --> 01:02:34,277
needed a strong host in order to spread.
Germany was that host.

590
01:02:34,483 --> 01:02:37,919
But strong as it was,
Germany could not prevail.

591
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,714
The world was too big.

592
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,723
Fortunately, the world has changed.

593
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:49,364
Global communications,
cable TV, the internet.

594
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:52,295
Today the world is smaller

595
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:56,665
and the virus does not need
a strong host in order to spread.

596
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:59,566
This virus...

597
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,436
...is airborne.

598
01:03:04,446 --> 01:03:08,815
One more thing.
Let no man call us crazy.

599
01:03:09,017 --> 01:03:14,080
They called Hitler crazy, but Hitler
wasn't crazy. He was stupid.

600
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:16,849
You don't fight Russia and America.

601
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:20,825
You get Russia and America
to fight each other

602
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:24,089
and destroy each other.

603
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:04,238
- What did you find?
- Ukraine's exports are online.

604
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:06,373
I pulled up the shipping manifests.

605
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:11,376
The only crate that size was picked up
at Kiev International ten days ago

606
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,377
and flown to the Canary Islands.

607
01:04:13,582 --> 01:04:16,676
The air force has a nuclear
assessment team. Call them...

608
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:21,117
Jack, it got put on a cargo freighter,
headed for the East Coast.

609
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:26,220
- What?
- Baltimore. It's coming here.

610
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:39,304
It's a great view from the Budweiser
blimp as we count down to game time.

611
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,068
We'll have the pre-game festivities

612
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:46,577
as well as the arrival of the nation's
number one football fan in a moment.

613
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:51,981
Then conquer we must

614
01:04:52,187 --> 01:04:56,521
For our cause it is just

615
01:04:56,959 --> 01:05:01,987
And this be our motto

616
01:05:02,197 --> 01:05:06,361
In God is our trust

617
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:11,232
And the star-spangled banner

618
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:20,314
Forever shall wave

619
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:26,283
O'er the land of the free...

620
01:05:27,155 --> 01:05:29,385
Get me the duty officer!

621
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:37,464
Home of the brave

622
01:05:46,508 --> 01:05:50,171
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States,

623
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,643
Robert Fowler!

624
01:05:56,985 --> 01:05:58,612
Showtime.

625
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:30,548
Shit.

626
01:06:37,592 --> 01:06:40,356
1 5 yard penalty, first down.

627
01:06:40,562 --> 01:06:41,995
That's the way!

628
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:50,838
Shit.

629
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,427
Hello.

630
01:07:13,595 --> 01:07:15,654
- Hello?
- Sir!

631
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:18,628
- Hello?
- Sir!

632
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:23,968
Shit!

633
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,582
- Cabot.
- It's Ryan.

634
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,994
- What?
- The bomb is in play.

635
01:07:48,196 --> 01:07:53,998
The AFRAT team are meeting me at
the docks in 20 minutes to try to find it.

636
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:56,727
- What docks?
- Baltimore.

637
01:07:56,938 --> 01:08:00,738
- You're breaking up. What did you say?
- Baltimore.

638
01:08:00,942 --> 01:08:05,003
- I'm losing you. I'll call you back...
- Baltimore.

639
01:08:07,415 --> 01:08:08,882
Sir!

640
01:08:34,709 --> 01:08:37,439
John! Red-Green! Let's go! Let's go!

641
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,248
Move it! Let's go!

642
01:08:49,591 --> 01:08:51,991
Move! Go, go, go, go! Move!

643
01:09:00,802 --> 01:09:02,770
What the hell is going on?

644
01:09:02,971 --> 01:09:07,374
Some Russian scientists made a
nuclear bomb. It's arrived in Baltimore.

645
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:11,137
- Get those people out of the stadium.
- Stay down!

646
01:09:32,934 --> 01:09:36,131
The President has been taken
off the field.

647
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,034
- 407.
- Thanks, JJ.

648
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:29,713
Clearly something has happened
of tremendous proportions.

649
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:35,295
We have no word as to what but
there is an enormous cloud over...

650
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:11,393
Go, go, go!

651
01:11:18,373 --> 01:11:21,171
Mr President! Are you all right?

652
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:23,571
He's stuck. Get out of the way.

653
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:30,376
Mr President, are you all right?

654
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:38,181
Are you all right, Mr President?
This is the marines, sir.

655
01:11:38,393 --> 01:11:40,054
I need your help, Danny.

656
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:43,458
Alvarez, get me a stretcher, now!

657
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,993
You got the stretcher?

658
01:11:54,676 --> 01:11:58,544
- You got the stretcher?
- No, I don't want one.

659
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:01,682
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

660
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:04,474
Move it!

661
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:14,955
Move it!

662
01:12:21,536 --> 01:12:24,334
Go, go! Close them off! Go on up!

663
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:50,995
Mr President...

664
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,760
There's been a nuclear explosion in
America. You must come with us now.

665
01:12:55,336 --> 01:12:56,860
What?

666
01:12:58,106 --> 01:13:02,372
We don't know who or how.
But it wasn't us.

667
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:06,809
After Grozny you hope it wasn't us.

668
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:09,506
We are drafting
a strong denial for you.

669
01:13:09,717 --> 01:13:12,379
And a statement of sympathy.

670
01:13:12,587 --> 01:13:16,079
And Yuri... order all military
on the alert.

671
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:04,790
Hey! It's Ryan.

672
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,701
- Jack, where are you?
- Somewhere outside Baltimore.

673
01:15:08,903 --> 01:15:11,838
- Cabot got the President out.
- Where is he now?

674
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:17,000
They're taking him airborne, on NAOC.
They think it might be the Russians.

675
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,317
It wasn't the Russians. I gotta talk to
Cabot. Patch me through to the plane.

676
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:28,080
Cabot's not on the plane. We don't
know where he is. Call back in an hour.

677
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:32,521
We don't have an hour. Fowler's
gonna want to hit back now.

678
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:39,159
Listen. We have to prove it wasn't the
Russians before he's convinced it is.

679
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:41,301
Can you get back to Langley?

680
01:15:41,502 --> 01:15:46,804
There's no time. The radiation
assessment team, where are they?

681
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:47,909
Stambler Tunnels, south of the city.

682
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:49,604
Stambler Tunnels, south of the city.

683
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:54,104
The prevailing winds are blowing
the fallout to the east and north.

684
01:15:54,315 --> 01:15:56,374
As long as you stay south you're OK.

685
01:15:58,753 --> 01:16:02,689
- Mr President, are you all right?
- How the hell do you think I am?

686
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:05,120
- How many casualties?
- We don't know.

687
01:16:05,326 --> 01:16:10,491
- How the hell did it get there?
- We don't know. Radar didn't pick it up.

688
01:16:10,698 --> 01:16:14,327
- Well, how is Cabot? Where is he?
- I don't know.

689
01:16:14,535 --> 01:16:17,368
- What do you know?
- I don't know, all right? I don't know!

690
01:16:17,572 --> 01:16:19,233
I don't know!

691
01:16:31,919 --> 01:16:36,356
- General, Kondor is not on board.
- Send the AFRAT team.

692
01:16:37,725 --> 01:16:40,694
Mr President, I recommend
we move to DEFCON-2.

693
01:16:40,895 --> 01:16:42,453
Where's our intelligence?

694
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:44,928
Russian air defences
are at their highest level.

695
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:48,864
Maybe they're afraid of being attacked.
I can't get this goddamn chair open!

696
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:50,401
We're about to take off.

697
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:53,233
- We don't know who did it...
- We think the Russians...

698
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:55,773
- You think?
- Sir, DEFCON-2.

699
01:16:55,977 --> 01:16:59,879
- We're groping in the dark...
- This is too much goddamn bullshit!

700
01:17:02,283 --> 01:17:04,581
And not enough fact.

701
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,658
The blast crater is about
1 00, 1 50 yards wide,

702
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:25,270
which suggests a low-yield device,

703
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:28,442
quite a bit smaller
than the Hiroshima bomb.

704
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:32,670
A quarter of a square mile
around the stadium is just gone.

705
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:37,249
Beyond that, buildings remain, heavily
damaged, for another quarter mile.

706
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:41,252
The damage tapers off the farther
you get from Ground Zero.

707
01:17:50,598 --> 01:17:51,929
Dubinin.

708
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:57,036
Herr Haft has left for America.
Now we are counting on you.

709
01:17:58,706 --> 01:18:02,938
I assure you,
I will earn every pfennig.

710
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,113
Attention.

711
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,442
You've heard of the bomb in the USA.

712
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,914
What you haven't heard
is that 1 5 minutes ago

713
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,386
an American ICBM hit Moscow.

714
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:23,622
We are to retaliate against an American
aircraft carrier in the North Sea.

715
01:18:23,798 --> 01:18:26,323
Man your aircraft.

716
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:53,159
The ash isn't radioactive. The winds
are blowing the fallout to sea.

717
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,158
Captain. Jack Ryan, CIA.

718
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:58,264
Lorna Shiro. You need to wait outside.

719
01:18:58,466 --> 01:19:01,196
I need to know all you know
about the bomb.

720
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:07,307
We're collecting samples. Get in line
and we'll have the report out tomorrow.

721
01:19:07,508 --> 01:19:11,308
Captain, I need to know now
where this bomb came from,

722
01:19:11,512 --> 01:19:16,074
or even where it didn't come from
or there may not be a tomorrow.

723
01:19:16,884 --> 01:19:19,478
Shit. Wesson, where are you?

724
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:21,678
About a quarter mile from Ground Zero.

725
01:19:21,889 --> 01:19:26,952
This is about as far as we'll go.
My feet are sizzling.

726
01:19:27,161 --> 01:19:30,221
I'm getting rads
nearly the limit of our gear.

727
01:19:30,431 --> 01:19:33,958
- OK. Cut the rover loose and get out.
- Roger that.

728
01:19:44,078 --> 01:19:48,708
Dillon, the crate the bomb was shipped
in. Somebody had to sign for it at port.

729
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:52,613
Customs must have a database.
Get me a name. Where's Cabot?

730
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,448
No one knows.
We're checking the hospitals.

731
01:19:55,656 --> 01:19:58,147
- Have you tried Memorial?
- He wouldn't be there.

732
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:01,522
No, I mean... Is it still...

733
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:06,063
It's Cathy's hospital.

734
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:09,929
As far as I know it's still there,
but the phones are down.

735
01:20:10,137 --> 01:20:12,662
All right. Can you keep checking?
Thanks.

736
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:19,907
They could have launched
a cruise missile.

737
01:20:20,114 --> 01:20:23,083
- We don't know that this is Russia.
- We don't know it's not.

738
01:20:23,284 --> 01:20:28,813
If they were sending us a message,
they'd want us to know it was them.

739
01:20:29,023 --> 01:20:32,891
Except they could inspire
the confusion we're going through now.

740
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:35,187
Mr President, we're uplinked.

741
01:20:38,566 --> 01:20:44,698
President Nemerov, there's been a
major nuclear event in the United States.

742
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:46,396
Loss of life is severe.

743
01:20:46,607 --> 01:20:49,201
- It was no accident.
- It was not an accident.

744
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,811
We don't yet know where
it came from, we don't...

745
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:58,680
We have not yet ascertained the
source of this weapon. Rest assured...

746
01:20:58,886 --> 01:21:03,687
We have not yet ascertained
the source of this weapon.

747
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:08,991
But rest assured those responsible
will be dealt with most severely.

748
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:13,466
He's fishing.

749
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:15,636
Send our reply.

750
01:21:17,691 --> 01:21:19,716
Whoa, that was a little fast.

751
01:21:19,926 --> 01:21:23,054
"Please accept the deepest
sympathies of the Russian people."

752
01:21:23,263 --> 01:21:26,562
"If it was deliberate,
this is a crime without precedent."

753
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:29,793
"What madman would do such a thing
and for what purpose?"

754
01:21:30,003 --> 01:21:33,302
"You must believe that Russia had
nothing to do with this infamous act."

755
01:21:33,507 --> 01:21:36,999
It's canned.
He prepared that in advance.

756
01:21:38,044 --> 01:21:42,481
President Nemerov, we've no reason
to suspect Russian involvement...

757
01:21:42,682 --> 01:21:44,149
...at this time...

758
01:21:44,551 --> 01:21:50,080
...but we will protect ourselves
from further aggression.

759
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:53,723
He thinks we did this.

760
01:21:53,894 --> 01:21:57,159
We must demonstrate
the strength of our weapons.

761
01:21:57,364 --> 01:22:03,030
They have to understand that
attacking Russia would be suicide.

762
01:22:03,236 --> 01:22:06,831
Increase the alert status.

763
01:22:43,076 --> 01:22:47,206
TAO, EW. I'm picking up
intermittent radar, bearing 020.

764
01:22:48,949 --> 01:22:50,348
Where?

765
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:54,518
Now it's gone.

766
01:23:02,762 --> 01:23:04,753
There. It's a weak signal.

767
01:23:04,965 --> 01:23:06,956
TAO, inbound contact.

768
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:14,297
Multiples on the same bearing.

769
01:23:16,443 --> 01:23:18,638
- Vampire, vampire!
- Fast movers inbound.

770
01:23:18,845 --> 01:23:21,245
I got seven, eight, nine of them!

771
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,570
The missiles definitely came
from Russian aircraft.

772
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:53,143
Grennel thinks he can save the ship,
but flight ops are out.

773
01:23:55,815 --> 01:23:58,716
I ordered no such attack.

774
01:23:58,885 --> 01:24:01,615
You must not respond to this action
until we investigate all possibilities.

775
01:24:01,855 --> 01:24:04,085
"...until we investigate all possibilities."

776
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:06,316
Like you did in Chechnya?

777
01:24:06,526 --> 01:24:09,825
Mr President, who is in control
of your armed forces?

778
01:24:12,299 --> 01:24:15,325
You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.

779
01:24:15,535 --> 01:24:18,470
You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki.

780
01:24:18,805 --> 01:24:21,501
Do not lecture me on Chechnya.

781
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:25,439
"...lecture me on Chechnya."

782
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:32,517
Mr President, we are now at a
de facto state of war with the Russians.

783
01:24:38,091 --> 01:24:43,051
John Clark was in Haifa yesterday.
We have to find him right away.

784
01:24:43,263 --> 01:24:45,128
Wow.
Look at that gadolinium reading.

785
01:24:45,332 --> 01:24:47,892
Yeah. The mass fraction is huge.

786
01:24:48,101 --> 01:24:51,002
OK, connect me to Dillon. I'll hold.

787
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:55,630
There it is. Savannah River.

788
01:24:56,543 --> 01:24:59,068
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, what?

789
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:00,974
They had a gadolinium problem.

790
01:25:01,181 --> 01:25:04,981
Hanford does it another way,
and generate too much promethium.

791
01:25:05,185 --> 01:25:07,676
Hold on. Can you translate that
into English?

792
01:25:09,556 --> 01:25:13,959
This plutonium came from the DOE
plant at Savannah River, February '68,

793
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,618
from K reactor. We even know
which part of K reactor.

794
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:22,359
- Wait. This is our plutonium?
- Made in the USA.

795
01:25:24,471 --> 01:25:26,871
Dillon, you've got to find Cabot.

796
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,610
Are you advocating we launch
a first strike?

797
01:25:36,816 --> 01:25:41,776
It is not a first strike! There's already
been a first strike, and a second.

798
01:25:41,988 --> 01:25:44,286
- Don't you get it?
- No, I don't get it!

799
01:25:44,491 --> 01:25:48,154
I don't understand why we have
to nuke them! It's not reasonable.

800
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:50,454
Sidney, goddamn it!

801
01:25:50,664 --> 01:25:53,394
They practically sank
an aircraft carrier!

802
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,229
Their missile silos are hot.
We're getting bullshit from Nemerov.

803
01:25:57,437 --> 01:26:02,340
Let's not forget how this started.
They tried to kill me, remember?

804
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:04,533
Don't fucking tell me to be reasonable!

805
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:14,243
Please come to the triage tent
on the side of the building.

806
01:26:14,454 --> 01:26:17,423
We will help you find
who you are looking for,

807
01:26:17,624 --> 01:26:20,616
but we are low on blood supply.

808
01:26:47,654 --> 01:26:49,019
Sir?

809
01:26:51,057 --> 01:26:52,422
Sir?

810
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,024
Hi.

811
01:26:58,698 --> 01:27:01,292
What?

812
01:27:01,501 --> 01:27:05,062
- President?
- The President's fine.

813
01:27:05,271 --> 01:27:07,967
He's fine. Sir...

814
01:27:08,842 --> 01:27:11,470
The bomb. The plutonium...

815
01:27:11,678 --> 01:27:13,976
- Wife.
- What?

816
01:27:14,681 --> 01:27:15,978
Wife.

817
01:27:16,182 --> 01:27:19,913
Your wife? I'm sure she's fine.
She's in DC.

818
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,021
The blast radius wasn't that...

819
01:27:24,324 --> 01:27:25,291
...it wasn't that wide.

820
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:26,315
...it wasn't that wide.

821
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:32,255
Sir, listen to me.

822
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,191
The plutonium was ours.

823
01:27:37,036 --> 01:27:42,269
John Clark's in Haifa to track down
the arms dealer. I can't get hold of him.

824
01:27:42,475 --> 01:27:44,773
I don't know what to do.

825
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:50,748
Girl... girlfriend.

826
01:27:53,086 --> 01:27:54,519
She...

827
01:27:55,288 --> 01:27:58,223
She works in Baltimore, so...

828
01:27:58,424 --> 01:28:00,187
...I don't know.

829
01:28:03,463 --> 01:28:04,862
Spinnaker.

830
01:28:05,064 --> 01:28:08,056
- What?
- Spinnaker.

831
01:28:12,572 --> 01:28:13,869
Sir?

832
01:28:15,742 --> 01:28:17,039
Bill?

833
01:28:49,909 --> 01:28:53,140
Yeah. We found the receiver address
for the crate.

834
01:28:53,346 --> 01:28:56,713
Port of Baltimore.
Can you get to the docks?

835
01:28:56,916 --> 01:29:01,216
Find the Transcon warehouse.
The name on the manifest is Mason.

836
01:29:02,021 --> 01:29:04,114
Sorry, I need this truck.

837
01:29:38,892 --> 01:29:40,189
Come on.

838
01:30:17,597 --> 01:30:18,859
Shit.

839
01:31:23,329 --> 01:31:26,423
Sir, we've come up
with another alternative.

840
01:31:26,632 --> 01:31:31,729
A conventional attack on the airbase
where the carrier attack originated.

841
01:31:31,938 --> 01:31:35,738
- It's a measured response.
- Non-nuclear.

842
01:31:35,942 --> 01:31:39,935
- Is it strong enough?
- Smart bombs and F-1 6s.

843
01:31:40,146 --> 01:31:42,842
Can't afford for them to see us as weak.

844
01:31:43,049 --> 01:31:46,985
They've got to know we have the guts
to take it to the next level.

845
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,788
I think they'll get that message.

846
01:31:54,394 --> 01:31:55,861
Hit'em.

847
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:13,668
Eagles Nest, this is Eagle One.
We have target acquired. Target is lit.

848
01:32:28,861 --> 01:32:31,762
To make no response
is to invite a greater attack.

849
01:32:31,964 --> 01:32:35,923
American submarines from Norfolk
and Kings Bay are putting to sea.

850
01:32:36,135 --> 01:32:41,664
They carry Trident D3 missiles.
A first strike weapon.

851
01:32:41,874 --> 01:32:44,399
Fowler is not so insane
as to launch a first strike.

852
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:46,703
Perhaps he doesn't think
it's the first strike.

853
01:32:46,913 --> 01:32:50,849
Once their Stealth bombers go up,
we will have no choice.

854
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:52,881
That will be the sign.

855
01:32:53,086 --> 01:32:55,452
How do we convince him
not to launch his bombers?

856
01:32:55,655 --> 01:33:00,888
- Maybe we should...
- Bring our missiles to highest alert.

857
01:33:01,094 --> 01:33:04,621
They'd be crazy to attack then.

858
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:08,560
Can I have your attention?

859
01:33:08,768 --> 01:33:11,396
The generator has gone out.

860
01:33:11,604 --> 01:33:16,507
There's broken glass everywhere. Stay
where you are. We will get back to...

861
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:20,736
OK, fine. Please, stay where you are.
We'll get you one by one.

862
01:33:34,293 --> 01:33:38,889
Sir, can you hear me?
Can you feel your arms and legs?

863
01:33:39,098 --> 01:33:43,296
A 9% IV and morphine drip.
Sir, we're gonna take care of you.

864
01:33:43,503 --> 01:33:45,471
What have you got?

865
01:33:46,205 --> 01:33:48,674
What do we do with the ones
we know won't make it?

866
01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:50,266
What do we do with the ones
we know won't make it?

867
01:33:50,476 --> 01:33:52,273
Whatever we can.

868
01:33:59,385 --> 01:34:00,750
What?

869
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:03,512
Bill Cabot died.

870
01:34:08,194 --> 01:34:10,162
I'm really sorry.

871
01:34:12,064 --> 01:34:14,225
This can't be happening.

872
01:34:30,116 --> 01:34:32,949
Sir, we have a call from Langley.

873
01:34:34,253 --> 01:34:36,016
Thank you.

874
01:34:38,357 --> 01:34:40,552
- Becker.
- This is Jack Ryan.

875
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,990
Great. The Nemerov apologist.

876
01:34:44,664 --> 01:34:48,259
Sir, this bomb was not Nemerov.
I know this guy.

877
01:34:48,701 --> 01:34:51,898
You said that after Grozny.
Put it in your report.

878
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:53,469
The plutonium...

879
01:35:07,954 --> 01:35:11,754
Seems unusual to find
radiation poisoning here.

880
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:14,051
I have never seen such a thing.

881
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:18,754
That is why we published the case
on the internet, to seek help.

882
01:35:18,965 --> 01:35:23,026
- How did he say it happened?
- He will not talk about it.

883
01:35:32,044 --> 01:35:36,242
Was anyone else exposed
to the materials that made you sick?

884
01:35:42,221 --> 01:35:45,315
Mr Ghazi, I'm not the police.

885
01:35:46,325 --> 01:35:50,489
I'm a physician. I assure you
anything you say stays between us.

886
01:35:57,136 --> 01:36:00,936
My friend and I find bomb.

887
01:36:02,942 --> 01:36:07,106
We sell to a man
who buys such things.

888
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:13,344
Was it this man?

889
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:23,420
Other people may have come
in contact with that bomb.

890
01:36:24,563 --> 01:36:26,588
We must help them.

891
01:36:37,810 --> 01:36:42,076
I am... going to die?

892
01:36:42,281 --> 01:36:43,612
Yes?

893
01:36:47,987 --> 01:36:49,284
Yes.

894
01:37:02,168 --> 01:37:05,729
His name is Olson.

895
01:37:08,574 --> 01:37:11,202
He live in Damascus.

896
01:37:29,628 --> 01:37:32,495
Oh, yeah. We're getting it all.

897
01:37:34,266 --> 01:37:38,635
A nuclear strike on Colorado Springs
would take out NORAD.

898
01:37:38,838 --> 01:37:42,330
It would limit their ability
to launch a counter-attack.

899
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:45,704
How many people live
in Colorado Springs?

900
01:37:46,846 --> 01:37:50,179
Three or four hundred thousand.

901
01:37:50,383 --> 01:37:54,251
Mr President, to use nuclear weapons
against the Americans...

902
01:37:54,453 --> 01:37:56,614
...would be to cross a threshold.

903
01:37:56,822 --> 01:38:03,284
They think we already have. Should
we now wait for them to annihilate us?

904
01:38:03,796 --> 01:38:08,392
I cannot stop what I did not start.

905
01:38:10,503 --> 01:38:13,666
Mr President, we need you
to initiate snap count.

906
01:38:15,007 --> 01:38:16,497
What happens then?

907
01:38:16,709 --> 01:38:21,078
We prepare to take out their land-based
missiles with a nuclear strike,

908
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:25,876
find and kill their subs, knock out
the planes they have on the ground

909
01:38:26,085 --> 01:38:30,545
and mobilize our fighters to destroy
the ones they already have in the air.

910
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:33,317
What are our chances?

911
01:38:34,226 --> 01:38:35,887
David?

912
01:38:38,297 --> 01:38:42,165
Odds are we leave Nemerov
in a pretty pickle.

913
01:38:42,368 --> 01:38:45,997
He'll be left with, at best,
a few hundred nukes,

914
01:38:46,205 --> 01:38:48,537
the ones we can't find.

915
01:38:48,741 --> 01:38:53,610
Mostly the... smaller, more mobile,
less accurate kind.

916
01:38:53,813 --> 01:38:56,407
All those can do is target our cities.

917
01:38:56,615 --> 01:39:01,052
But he knows to an absolute certainty
that we will respond against his cities.

918
01:39:07,326 --> 01:39:10,523
I spent my entire adult life
wanting to be president.

919
01:39:13,899 --> 01:39:16,231
This is my presidency?

920
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:22,764
Sir, I think he'll keep his 300 nukes as a
deterrent against any future aggressor.

921
01:39:22,975 --> 01:39:26,843
I think he'll push back from the table
and call it a night.

922
01:39:30,249 --> 01:39:34,345
I'm giving the order for snap count.
Maximum readiness.

923
01:39:43,529 --> 01:39:48,868
Olson had wire payments of $45 million
from someone named Dressler.

924
01:39:48,868 --> 01:39:49,197
Olson had wire payments of $45 million
from someone named Dressler.

925
01:39:49,401 --> 01:39:53,269
Dillon, find out who Dressler is.
Jack, I want you out of there.

926
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:56,635
- I'm at the docks.
- Look for the name Dressler.

927
01:39:56,842 --> 01:40:00,642
No. Jack, get out. Dillon, call the
Baltimore PD, give them the address.

928
01:40:00,846 --> 01:40:03,644
- Wait for the cops.
- I'll call you back.

929
01:41:28,467 --> 01:41:30,492
Who's Dressler?

930
01:41:34,707 --> 01:41:36,937
Where is he, goddamn it?

931
01:41:37,142 --> 01:41:39,804
Where is Dressler?

932
01:41:40,045 --> 01:41:42,605
Police! Put your hands up!

933
01:41:42,815 --> 01:41:45,249
- Where's Dressler?
- Are you Jack Ryan?

934
01:41:45,451 --> 01:41:49,148
- Where's Dressler, goddamn it?
- Let him go!

935
01:41:49,355 --> 01:41:52,381
Where's Dressler? Where is he?

936
01:41:55,828 --> 01:41:58,388
Langley said you might need help.

937
01:41:58,597 --> 01:42:01,862
- I gotta get to the Pentagon.
- I think I can help you with that.

938
01:42:22,521 --> 01:42:24,284
Mr President.

939
01:42:24,490 --> 01:42:27,584
Their Stealth bombers
have left Aviano.

940
01:42:29,862 --> 01:42:32,854
That is the sign.

941
01:42:33,065 --> 01:42:36,432
Shoot them down.

942
01:42:40,439 --> 01:42:42,566
God protect us.

943
01:42:43,609 --> 01:42:47,306
Mr President, they're scrambling
their fighters. We're out of time.

944
01:42:50,983 --> 01:42:53,213
- Dave!
- He has a heart condition.

945
01:42:53,419 --> 01:42:55,319
- Get a doctor.
- Mr President.

946
01:42:55,521 --> 01:42:57,489
- Where's your nitro?
- I said get a doctor!

947
01:42:57,690 --> 01:43:00,955
- Mr President.
- Take him to my quarters.

948
01:43:01,493 --> 01:43:04,018
Colonel, bring in the launch codes.

949
01:43:20,979 --> 01:43:24,073
Dressler's an Austrian manufacturer,
billionaire.

950
01:43:24,283 --> 01:43:26,774
His father was executed at Nuremberg.

951
01:43:26,985 --> 01:43:31,547
He bought a seat in parliament and got
booted out for saying pro-Nazi things.

952
01:43:31,757 --> 01:43:33,315
Rudy, get me through to the President.

953
01:43:33,525 --> 01:43:36,756
I can't do it, Jack.
They're in the snap count.

954
01:43:36,962 --> 01:43:38,930
- There's no way in.
- Bullshit.

955
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:18,927
- I can do that for you, sir.
- No, it's fine. Got some dirt on it.

956
01:44:19,138 --> 01:44:21,971
- Can I see it? We're on high alert.
- I understand.

957
01:44:22,174 --> 01:44:24,904
- Sir, put the card down.
- Back off.

958
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:27,408
- I am ordering you...
- Back off!

959
01:44:27,613 --> 01:44:32,641
Step back now! I am ordering
you to take a step back! Put...

960
01:44:44,196 --> 01:44:46,756
General, there's a Dr Ryan
from the CIA.

961
01:44:46,965 --> 01:44:49,490
He wants to enter NMCC.
He's unescorted.

962
01:44:49,701 --> 01:44:51,692
- What's he want?
- You, sir.

963
01:44:51,904 --> 01:44:57,809
I have a message from Director Cabot
that I need to transmit over the hotline.

964
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:00,570
- What's your authorization?
- I don't have one.

965
01:45:00,779 --> 01:45:03,373
- Where's Cabot?
- Cabot's dead, sir.

966
01:45:03,582 --> 01:45:08,417
- I need to get this information sent.
- Not without authorization. Get him out.

967
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:14,183
Wait! General! The President is basing
his decisions on bad information!

968
01:45:14,393 --> 01:45:17,624
If you shut me out,
your family and my family

969
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:21,789
and 25 million other families
will be dead in 30 minutes.

970
01:45:28,006 --> 01:45:32,340
My orders are to get this information
to the people who make the decisions.

971
01:45:32,544 --> 01:45:35,638
I just need to send some information.

972
01:45:37,216 --> 01:45:39,741
What makes you think
the President will listen to you?

973
01:45:43,722 --> 01:45:45,713
He doesn't have to.

974
01:45:46,091 --> 01:45:48,252
How close are the bombers?

975
01:45:49,194 --> 01:45:55,258
They're slipping in and out of radar
over Poland.

976
01:45:59,338 --> 01:46:04,071
Activate the missile regiments.

977
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:15,013
The launch sequence takes a minute
to process after you give the order.

978
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:19,350
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed.

979
01:46:24,463 --> 01:46:28,092
Mine is the... My number is...

980
01:46:29,234 --> 01:46:32,101
...the third one... third number down
from the top.

981
01:46:32,838 --> 01:46:34,999
Your orders, sir?

982
01:46:35,207 --> 01:46:37,675
- Strike.
- I'm sorry, sir?

983
01:46:37,876 --> 01:46:40,276
I give the order to strike.

984
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:44,848
Under the two-man rule, the order
to strike must now be confirmed.

985
01:46:46,752 --> 01:46:49,220
Bob, for the love of God.

986
01:46:49,421 --> 01:46:51,218
Just do it.

987
01:46:56,261 --> 01:47:00,459
Sidney Owens, Secretary of State.
It's the fourth number down.

988
01:47:09,942 --> 01:47:13,275
The order to strike has now been
confirmed by the two-man rule.

989
01:47:13,478 --> 01:47:17,744
NMCC, strike order has been
confirmed. Start the sequence.

990
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:20,680
- We've got activity on the hotline.
- They've had their chance.

991
01:47:20,886 --> 01:47:22,148
No, somebody's talking to the Kremlin.

992
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:32,591
It says, "America has been the victim
of a terrorist attack."

993
01:47:32,864 --> 01:47:37,324
As you can imagine, there has
been much confusion here...

994
01:47:37,936 --> 01:47:39,733
...and fear.

995
01:47:39,938 --> 01:47:42,998
But we know the weapon
was not Russian.

996
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:46,609
"But we know the weapon
was not Russian."

997
01:47:46,812 --> 01:47:48,370
What the hell is going on?

998
01:47:55,787 --> 01:47:58,551
Type exactly what I say.

999
01:47:58,724 --> 01:48:01,420
Who are we talking to?

1000
01:48:04,062 --> 01:48:09,728
Ryan. I met you in Moscow with
Bill Cabot. He died today in Baltimore.

1001
01:48:09,935 --> 01:48:12,995
- Cut him off.
- Launch sequence has begun.

1002
01:48:13,205 --> 01:48:14,695
Two months ago,

1003
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:18,569
a neo-fascist named Dressler bought
an A-bomb on the black market.

1004
01:48:18,777 --> 01:48:22,440
- Cut him off.
- The system can't be cut off.

1005
01:48:22,647 --> 01:48:24,672
Then get someone to stop him.

1006
01:48:24,883 --> 01:48:29,149
- He paid three disaffected Russian...
- "scientists to make the bomb active."

1007
01:48:29,354 --> 01:48:32,255
"He shipped it to the US,
where a man named Mason"

1008
01:48:32,457 --> 01:48:37,053
was hired to deliver the bomb and
set our countries on a collision course.

1009
01:48:37,429 --> 01:48:41,593
This is madness. He is CIA.

1010
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,031
We cannot hang our fate
on the word of their spy.

1011
01:48:45,237 --> 01:48:49,196
What is the harm of listening
a bit more?

1012
01:48:53,278 --> 01:48:55,940
What are you asking of me?

1013
01:49:05,057 --> 01:49:06,285
Back down.

1014
01:49:10,729 --> 01:49:14,426
What guarantee do I have that
President Fowler will follow suit?

1015
01:49:15,767 --> 01:49:17,325
None.

1016
01:49:20,338 --> 01:49:23,671
You see? He is wasting time.

1017
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:26,105
We must launch now.
We have only moments.

1018
01:49:28,547 --> 01:49:32,745
Sir, I know you had nothing to do
with the Baltimore bomb

1019
01:49:32,951 --> 01:49:37,411
and you know you didn't, but you're
still about to launch a nuclear strike.

1020
01:49:37,622 --> 01:49:40,955
- Yes, sir. That's all, Dr Ryan.
- This is about fear.

1021
01:49:41,159 --> 01:49:43,389
Fear of your missiles,
fear of our subs.

1022
01:49:43,595 --> 01:49:45,563
Fear of being weak,
of making a mistake,

1023
01:49:45,764 --> 01:49:49,928
the fear of the other guy that had us
build these bombs in the first place!

1024
01:49:53,371 --> 01:49:54,668
It stopped.

1025
01:49:57,776 --> 01:49:59,073
They cut him off.

1026
01:50:00,078 --> 01:50:01,511
They are going to strike.

1027
01:50:01,713 --> 01:50:04,807
Prepare the launch orders now.

1028
01:50:19,498 --> 01:50:21,295
30 seconds to launch.

1029
01:50:21,466 --> 01:50:23,627
Oh, my God. Mr President?

1030
01:50:33,478 --> 01:50:36,709
We will maintain our defensive alert
for the moment,

1031
01:50:36,915 --> 01:50:39,679
but our offensive forces
are withdrawn.

1032
01:50:39,885 --> 01:50:44,549
"If you match this, I propose a phased
mutual stand down over five hours."

1033
01:50:46,658 --> 01:50:48,683
Stop the launch sequence.

1034
01:50:48,894 --> 01:50:52,625
Lasseter here. Flash override.
Stop the sequence!

1035
01:50:53,698 --> 01:50:57,327
Order the planes to stand down.
Take us to DEFCON-3.

1036
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:01,495
And would somebody ask Mr Ryan
if I can use the phone now?

1037
01:51:31,303 --> 01:51:33,328
You're still here.

1038
01:54:45,296 --> 01:54:49,699
There is no more fitting memorial
for those who perished in this tragedy

1039
01:54:49,901 --> 01:54:52,096
than the steps we've taken this week

1040
01:54:52,303 --> 01:54:54,328
toward a multinational campaign

1041
01:54:54,539 --> 01:54:58,600
to root out and eliminate
weapons of mass destruction.

1042
01:54:59,911 --> 01:55:05,315
We embarked on this course because
we have learned, at too great a cost,

1043
01:55:05,517 --> 01:55:08,884
that if the most powerful weapons
ever created are unleashed,

1044
01:55:09,087 --> 01:55:13,023
they will be fired not in anger,
but in fear.

1045
01:55:13,224 --> 01:55:14,555
Dr Ryan.

1046
01:55:15,927 --> 01:55:17,758
Mr Grushkov.

1047
01:55:18,129 --> 01:55:21,792
It is... a lovely day.

1048
01:55:23,668 --> 01:55:25,158
Yeah.

1049
01:55:25,970 --> 01:55:30,464
- I'm sorry, this is...
- Dr Muller. How do you do?

1050
01:55:31,543 --> 01:55:33,807
Nice to meet you.

1051
01:55:35,447 --> 01:55:37,847
Why am I not surprised
you know her name?

1052
01:55:40,118 --> 01:55:43,349
Our friend William thought
I was a spy.

1053
01:55:43,555 --> 01:55:46,183
Of course, he could never prove it.

1054
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:50,223
He never told me you were friends.

1055
01:55:51,362 --> 01:55:53,830
Maybe he didn't know you well enough.

1056
01:55:56,501 --> 01:55:59,231
He told me he had a source in Russia.

1057
01:56:01,539 --> 01:56:03,598
"To keep the back channels open?"

1058
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:07,603
"In hopes of staving off disaster."

1059
01:56:07,812 --> 01:56:12,112
Kennedy said,
"Our most basic common link"

1060
01:56:12,317 --> 01:56:16,048
"is that we all inhabit
this small planet. "

1061
01:56:17,655 --> 01:56:20,283
"We all breathe the same air. "

1062
01:56:20,925 --> 01:56:25,419
"We all cherish our children's future..."

1063
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:28,592
"...and we're all mortal. "

1064
01:56:29,467 --> 01:56:34,632
I will miss... so very much
talking to William.

1065
01:56:36,574 --> 01:56:38,041
Me too.

1066
01:56:38,977 --> 01:56:42,469
Perhaps from time to time

1067
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:45,308
you and I can talk.

1068
01:56:45,517 --> 01:56:47,849
Yeah, I'd like that.

1069
01:56:50,588 --> 01:56:51,885
What is this?

1070
01:56:53,057 --> 01:56:56,925
A modest gift for your engagement.

1071
01:56:59,197 --> 01:57:00,994
He... he just asked me this morning.

1072
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:03,895
We haven't told anybody about it.

1073
01:57:05,136 --> 01:57:07,832
How... how could you possibly know?

1074
01:57:08,305 --> 01:58:08,468
