00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,375
JUNE 6, 1944

3
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:51,375
THE NORMANDY INVASION

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,958
AFTER 2 MONTHS OF HEAVY FIGHTING

5
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:06,916
THE GERMANS HASTILY RETREAT.

6
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,250
THE ALLIES DESPERATELY
NEED TO CAPTURE A PORT

7
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:16,500
TO GET SUPPLIES TO THEIR TROOPS.

8
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,750
BELGIUM

9
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,375
BRUSSELS

10
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,208
ANTWERP

11
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:30,250
ANTWERP IS LIBERATED
AND THE PORT IS INTACT.

12
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,666
THE SCHELDT RIVER

13
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,250
BUT ANTWERP CANNOT BE REACHED

14
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:43,250
AS THE GERMANS HOLD THE SCHELDT.

15
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:51,458
PART OF THE GERMAN ARMY

16
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,958
RETREATS ACROSS THE RIVER SCHELDT.

17
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,375
THE NETHERLANDS EXPECTS
TO BE LIBERATED AT ANY MOMENT.

18
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,833
What's going on here?

19
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,416
Keep moving.

20
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,583
- Just get rid of it.
- Where are the papers?

21
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,875
Hurry up! Everything must go.

22
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,291
For the mayor. Take it.

23
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,958
Go, go, go!

24
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,708
Just throw it away!

25
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,916
And stay with it until
everything has been burned. Understood?

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,166
I'll do the last documents myself.

27
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,250
- Sir.
- Yes.

28
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:38,208
Go.
Teuntje, would you help my wife pack?

29
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,333
And I think you should go home afterwards
and pack your things.

30
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,708
What do you mean?

31
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,416
Your father works for the Germans, no?

32
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,416
For sick Germans and for sick Zeelanders.

33
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,625
- Burn it!
- Yes, of course.

34
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,853
Those are National Socialists!

35
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,291
You can't do that!

36
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,875
- Guess what I'm gonna do!
- Who do you think you are?

37
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,500
Guess what I'm gonna do. Huh?

38
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,333
Who do you think you are?

39
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,916
Move forwards now.

40
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,250
ELECTRIC BAKERY
SCHOENMAKERS

41
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,083
It's over, Teun.

42
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,916
It's over. We got rid of them.

43
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,708
Come on.
The Canadians have crossed the border.

44
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,375
Who was that man?

45
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,500
Oh, no one Just some happy man.

46
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,916
Hand me the camera.

47
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,541
Give me the camera.

48
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,750
Where are your liberators?
Huh? Where are they?

49
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,833
Idiots. We're still in command.

50
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,791
Watch out.

51
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,500
Hey, move!

52
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,250
Idiot. Move out the way. Move!

53
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,666
Back. Move back.

54
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,125
Ah!

55
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,416
Move.

56
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,416
Don't just stand there.

57
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,250
It was him!

58
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,041
Stop!

59
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,666
Teun.

60
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,083
Teun!

61
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,708
Oh, Teun...

62
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,458
Hmm?

63
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,708
Oh, hey.
What's going on? There were shots.

64
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,750
Yeah... there, uh, there was
an accident with a couple of Germans.

65
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:23,916
Is it serious?

66
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,458
- Is Dirk home yet?
- Haven't seen him yet.

67
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:32,166
But when he gets home, stay home.
It's chaos in the streets.

68
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,958
- I'm off to the hospital.
- Now?

69
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,083
- They'll be needing me now.
- But we... we are free.

70
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,000
I know, Teun, you're right.
We'll celebrate tomorrow.

71
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,375
Okay?

72
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,291
Dirk?

73
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,083
NARVA, THE RUSSIAN FRONT
11 AUGUST 1944.

74
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,458
You. Get up! Up!

75
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,333
Into the trenches, now! Get into position!

76
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,750
What's going on here?

77
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,541
They're coming.

78
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,083
Get in position!

79
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,416
Quickly! Hold!

80
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,625
Load.

81
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,000
Now show them how hard you are.

82
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,916
We won't give up!

83
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,208
Lukas?

84
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,208
Hey. Hey.

85
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,291
Look at me. Look.

86
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,083
You'll be fine.

87
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,666
Stay low. Okay?

88
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,083
Fire!

89
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,291
Fire!

90
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,625
Lukas! Luuk!

91
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,458
Pull back!

92
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,708
Shoot! Shoot!

93
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,916
Get up!

94
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,458
Lukas. Come on.

95
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,708
Lukas!

96
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,291
Luuk!

97
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:12,791
Luuk!

98
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,708
Lukas!

99
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,583
Lukas!

100
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,166
Luuk!

101
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,166
Dirk.

102
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,208
Hey, where have you been?

103
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,291
Idiot.

104
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,333
You could have been killed.

105
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,916
Dad says we have to stay indoors tonight.

106
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,541
You and Dad, you're sissies. Both of you.

107
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,500
Ow.

108
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,625
Not a word to him, okay?

109
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,666
<i>Maintain your low tow position.</i>

110
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,125
<i>Remain directly behind
and in line with me.</i>

111
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,666
<i>Keep focused on my tail.</i>

112
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,041
<i>Is everything under control, chaps? Over.</i>

113
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,083
You bet, sir.

114
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,958
<i>Have you asked yourselves
how a glider pilot gets back, boys?</i>

115
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,833
<i>He doesn't.</i>

116
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,916
<i>Once you've landed in enemy territory,
there's no way back.</i>

117
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,958
<i>Hence the lovely nickname,
a flying coffin.</i>

118
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:27,458
<i>We are approaching 1,000 feet.
Prepare yourselves for decoupling. Over.</i>

119
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,958
Roger. Over.

120
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,666
It's right this way.

121
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,333
Idiot.

122
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:02,958
What?

123
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,625
What the bloody hell was that?

124
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,208
A roll, sir.

125
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,666
It was a childish maneuver.

126
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,250
In war, there's no place for boys
that want to act the hero.

127
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,500
Grow up.

128
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,083
In war, you've got to
be ready for anything, sir.

129
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,208
Those are your words.

130
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,750
My word was also to your father.

131
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,958
I promised him I'd have you back
for Christmas dinner. Alive.

132
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,916
Yeah. There's no need
to break that promise, sir.

133
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,041
I can still come, sir.

134
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,625
Only with your father's permission.

135
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,083
<i>You want to be part of them?</i>

136
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,291
Of that scum? Of those fascists?

137
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,458
Scum. That's what they are! Trash!

138
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,875
Get lost. Get! Get lost, you!

139
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,750
Ah. Van Staveren.

140
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:31,666
You're very lucky.
We removed a splinter from your guts.

141
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,875
Don't move too much. Try to sleep.

142
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:40,125
Take a look at these guys.
I wonder if it helps, idiot.

143
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,125
Are you Dutch?

144
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,458
How are you feeling?

145
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,166
Ah.

146
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,083
Are you lost?

147
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,208
Oh, you're on holiday?

148
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,916
I understand.
In beautiful Russia.

149
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,791
With its picturesque scenery
and friendly farmers.

150
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,833
Have you sent a postcard home yet?

151
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,083
Dear Mama...

152
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,291
A little card from the Third Reich.
It's wonderful here.

153
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,583
I love national socialism.

154
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,500
I would happily die for it.

155
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,333
Are you an officer?

156
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,541
First Lieutenant Friedrich Fischer.

157
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,750
Still.

158
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,791
You should actually salute me, but...

159
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,125
have a rest first.

160
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,083
You've earned it.

161
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,500
Hey.

162
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,416
Liberation. What a delusion.

163
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,083
The Germans are back, just like that.

164
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,083
The Allies never crossed our border.

165
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,541
They won't just give up on Walcheren.

166
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,333
Three airborne divisions...

167
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,583
35,000 men in military aircraft
and gliders

168
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,125
will depart from 24 airfields,

169
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:01,125
land in Holland,
64 miles behind enemy lines...

170
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,375
with one objective.

171
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,500
Retake Arnhem.

172
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,166
Operation Market Garden.

173
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,708
After which, we will regroup

174
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,583
and continue in a straight line to Berlin.

175
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,041
To put an end to the dark tyranny

176
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,916
that has held Europe in its grip
for nearly four years.

177
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,458
Pilots and soldiers,
the success of this operation

178
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,958
lies in your hands.

179
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,500
And with it, the fate of Europe.

180
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,541
Good luck.

181
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,648
- I'll see you at Christmas.
- Yes indeed.

182
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,583
Arnhem.

183
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,750
This is really gonna happen now.

184
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:11,875
That's the intention.

185
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,916
Been training really hard.

186
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,041
Reached my number of flying hours.

187
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,083
You know what is meant
by a sense of responsibility?

188
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,916
It's been ingrained in me
since I was a child, sir.

189
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,541
That's not apparent
from your last escapade.

190
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,083
Or did you think
special rules apply to you?

191
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,083
You're not ready.

192
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:39,208
And your mother will sleep more easily
knowing you're on the ground.

193
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,416
It's done. I can come.

194
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,750
- Really?
- Yes.

195
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,458
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

196
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,541
Don't know how you pulled that off.
But no funny stuff.

197
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,416
All my father did was work.

198
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,625
He grafted from early morning
to late at night for...

199
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,875
for a pittance.

200
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,125
And that will never change.

201
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,625
It will be exactly the same
for my little brother and sisters.

202
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,041
Is that fair?

203
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,583
I never saw you as an idealist.

204
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,958
Nothing will change unless someone
does something about it and...

205
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,416
- And I want...
- Strength.

206
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,916
- I want to be proud.
- Equality. Brotherhood.

207
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,500
I've learned something, Dutchman.

208
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,875
If the lie is big enough...

209
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,625
and you tell it often enough...

210
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,333
then people start to believe it.

211
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,750
Do you know who said that?

212
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,958
Our Minister of Propaganda,
Joseph Goebbels.

213
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,125
Are there any Jews in your neighborhood?

214
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,958
Most were arrested
at the start of the war.

215
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,083
And?

216
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,666
Did you ever see them again?

217
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,125
There's your equality.

218
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,125
The Jews,
they're all criminals and racketeers.

219
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,125
Does Chelmo mean anything to you?

220
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,875
That's where they put me
when they had no further use for me.

221
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,750
The elderly, the sick, children...

222
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,000
babies...

223
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,375
Jews, yeah.

224
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,333
I was the guard.

225
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,708
There is no such thing as good.

226
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,708
The evil...

227
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,583
in everyone. In every one of us.

228
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,541
Get in the trenches.

229
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:18,875
Idiots. Bastard.

230
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,208
Go. Ahead.

231
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,291
Wim!

232
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,125
Wim.

233
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:33,958
Come on.

234
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,291
Sit down.

235
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:12,083
- Oberst Berghof.
- Mayor Oostveen.

236
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,583
What can I do for you?

237
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:18,166
I am responsible
for defending this island.

238
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,416
I cannot let resistance terrorists
go unpunished.

239
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Of course.

240
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,416
If necessary,

241
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,750
I will arrest all the young men
who are registered here.

242
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,541
Of course.

243
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,041
I hope I can count on you.

244
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,583
Have a nice day.

245
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:40,500
I've heard from a reliable source...

246
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,708
Early this morning, three boys. Innocent.

247
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:47,791
They will be executed if the person
responsible doesn't turn himself in.

248
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,041
You know he didn't do anything!

249
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,875
He was not even there.

250
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,500
They're looking for the person who did it.

251
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,875
You have to go into hiding.

252
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,375
Dad has enough contacts.

253
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,333
Dad works for the Germans.

254
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:30,625
Janna can help.

255
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,083
Janna?

256
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:35,708
My Janna?

257
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,958
Hi, Teun.

258
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,041
Hey.

259
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,750
Dirk has to go into hiding and...

260
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,666
and you know where, he says.

261
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,125
They're after him.

262
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,250
Perhaps...

263
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,083
- I know people.
- Yeah? Who?

264
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,750
How come I don't know you know people?

265
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,333
Sometimes it's better
not to know too much, Teun.

266
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:29,208
So, how does Dirk know
that you know people?

267
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,333
What shall we eat?

268
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:41,375
I would like two bread rolls.

269
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,958
- Please.
- White bread.

270
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,125
Yes.

271
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,666
- Delicious.
- Three?

272
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,041
- Hello.
- Hello. Can I help you?

273
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,041
One bread roll and two of those.

274
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,000
<i>Van Staveren...</i>

275
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,208
Volunteer in the navy?

276
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,333
Assigned to the shock troops?

277
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:01,750
Yes, Sergeant.

278
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,791
I understand that you are better.

279
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,291
Good, I'll...

280
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,208
send you back in.

281
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,750
You start next week.
You're being transferred to Holland.

282
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:17,958
To Holland?

283
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,791
You leave tomorrow. Dismissed.

284
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,666
Today's your lucky day.

285
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:41,000
I made a call. You're getting a desk job.

286
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,958
In Zeeland, in the south.

287
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,375
Keep your head down, Dutchman.

288
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,916
This shit will be over soon.

289
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,083
And then you can start over.

290
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,458
I promise.

291
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:49,208
<i>We're flying at 6,000 feet.</i>

292
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,166
<i>Thunder Two to Thunder One,
you are two miles to port.</i>

293
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,625
<i>Thunder One
to Thunder Two. Roger.</i>

294
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:01,041
<i>Thunder One to Thunder Three,
pick up the lead.</i>

295
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,583
<i>Thunder Three
to Thunder One. Roger.</i>

296
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,375
That's it. Nice and steady.

297
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,166
<i>Bomber to Thunder Two. Correct.</i>

298
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,791
<i>Maintain speed.</i>

299
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,166
<i>Thunder Two to Thunder One,
cloud break ahead.</i>

300
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,666
<i>Maintain altitude.</i>

301
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:26,083
<i>Tow Plane Six to Troop Six.
Is everything under control? Over.</i>

302
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,625
Troop Six, everything's steady. Over.

303
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,833
<i>The lads are having a bet,</i>

304
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:34,125
<i>and who knows, this could be the last
we hear of you, so I'm just going to ask.</i>

305
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:38,291
<i>Is it true that Monty put your very young
co-pilot forward for this job personally?</i>

306
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:41,083
You're supposed
to observe radio silence, over.

307
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,833
<i>Is that the young co-pilot himself?</i>

308
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:46,101
<i>We just want to know what it's like to
have a daddy who's buddies with Churchill.</i>

309
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,750
<i>You'll be sipping tea
at Buckingham Palace when it's over.</i>

310
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:52,625
I'm more focused on the Jerries
I'm about to kill, Tow Plane Six, over.

311
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,750
All right.
That's enough out of you please, dingbats.

312
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,833
Keep your eyes on the job at hand.

313
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,791
Ah, Henk, old boy.

314
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,875
I do believe you are home sweet home.

315
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,875
It's beautiful. It's Zeeland.

316
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,083
It's a bit wet.

317
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,000
- <i>Steady.</i>
- Sit down, soldier.

318
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,166
<i>Stay on course.</i>

319
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,041
God.

320
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,375
<i>Keep it straight.
Keep it straight.</i>

321
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:33,916
<i>Stay on course. Stay in line.</i>

322
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:47,416
Blessed is thou amongst women,
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

323
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,916
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

324
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,416
Pray for us sinners...

325
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,291
Settle down, back there.

326
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,541
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

327
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:09,916
Tony.

328
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,875
<i>Tow Six, keep it straight, damn it.</i>

329
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:18,500
Tony. Tony! Talk to me, are you okay?

330
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,833
Check the wings. Check the wings!

331
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,000
The right one's fine.

332
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,791
Henk! Check the left wing!

333
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:33,875
Gone!

334
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,583
My God.

335
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:44,041
The left wing's damaged. It's gone.

336
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,875
- Tony, the left wing is gone.
- Release!

337
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,416
Release, William.

338
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,288
<i>Hold course.</i>

339
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,583
It's stuck! The release is stuck.

340
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:13,375
Listen.
There's too much tension in the cable.

341
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,125
You're going to have to roll it.

342
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:21,083
Did you hear me?
You're going to have to roll it.

343
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,041
Henk, come forward now! I need you.

344
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,291
<i>You have to release.</i>

345
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,500
<i>What's it going to take
for you to release?</i>

346
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,541
- <i>Release, now!</i>
- You need to focus.

347
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,125
- Pull the release lever as hard...
- What?

348
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:39,333
Focus, Henk.
In three we're going to go for a roll.

349
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:42,291
You pull that lever as hard as you can!

350
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,375
Okay. Ready? Three,

351
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,458
two...

352
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,208
...one!

353
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,916
Release!

354
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,375
Lift it, Will!

355
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,041
Lift it up.

356
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,125
Lift it!

357
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,250
Brace for impact.

358
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,708
Brace!

359
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,458
Dirk.

360
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,041
Dirk.

361
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,500
- Visser family?
- Yes.

362
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,208
Is your father home?

363
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:14,625
He's on duty.

364
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,291
May I wait here for him?

365
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,750
Lovely.

366
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:47,750
Tastefully decorated.

367
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,500
Would you like a drink?

368
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:07,000
Yes. Water would be lovely.

369
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yes.

370
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,541
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

371
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,583
Your mother?

372
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:01,875
Where is she?

373
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,083
In the cemetery.

374
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,333
I'm sorry.

375
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:15,750
My troops were involved in an accident
two weeks ago.

376
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,291
Three of my men
are in the cemetery now too.

377
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,541
Practically kids.

378
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,958
And that's your brother, I take it.
Wim, right?

379
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,375
Dirk.

380
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,750
Ah, yes. Of course. Dirk.

381
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:42,666
Good day. How can I help you?

382
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:53,166
Dr. Visser,
it's an honor to meet you.

383
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,291
- Oberst Berghof.
- It's a pleasure.

384
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,375
What can I do for you?

385
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:01,041
You may be able to help me.

386
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,791
Fuck. Are you okay?

387
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:16,791
Sir?

388
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:22,583
We've got to get out of here.

389
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:30,250
Sir, sir, I'm here.

390
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,250
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no.

391
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,458
No, no, no, no, no.

392
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,916
All right, sir, I've got you.

393
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
All right.

394
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,125
Nigel.

395
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:59,833
- Okay. Just get to dry land.
- They've probably already seen us.

396
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,625
Let's move out. Come on.

397
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,833
Come on.

398
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,083
Where the hell are we?

399
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:22,041
It's been five weeks
and it's only getting worse.

400
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,500
It's very infected.

401
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:29,250
I'll clean and disinfect the wound now

402
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:32,541
and afterwards at the hospital, we can...

403
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,916
remove the shrapnel.

404
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:38,291
You are a true doctor.

405
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,250
Passionate about your calling.

406
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,250
It's very clear.

407
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,833
Someone who does the right thing
in difficult circumstances.

408
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,500
Even if it requires personal sacrifice.

409
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,125
When you speak to your son,

410
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:00,458
ask him to report to our headquarters.

411
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,458
Yes?

412
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,791
- I'm turning myself in.
- No.

413
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,833
No, surely you're not doing that.

414
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,166
Janna will help you into hiding.
She promised.

415
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,833
So go pack your things.

416
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:47,208
If I go into hiding,
Wim and those other boys will die.

417
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,541
I have a good understanding
with the Germans.

418
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:53,083
- Perhaps if you turn yourself in...
- No.

419
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:58,708
- Teun, those boys...
- What do I care about those louts?

420
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:01,541
- But they didn't throw that rock.
- It was an accident.

421
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:07,041
I'll go to Berghof. I'll talk to him.

422
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:09,625
- Negotiate.
- With that man?

423
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:12,541
Maybe he'll get a prison sentence.

424
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,416
I know how to deal with them, Teun.

425
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,083
And the liberation
won't take that much longer, son.

426
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,250
There's no other way, Teun.

427
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:32,500
I think the Germans
flooded this island on purpose.

428
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,500
What do you mean, island?

429
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:40,625
I think this one's called Schouwen.
It's one of the smaller ones.

430
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:43,791
How far is that from Arnhem?

431
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,625
To Arnhem? How?

432
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,291
We're never going to make it.
Do you know how many Jerries there are?

433
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:54,041
We don't stand a chance.
Look at the state of us.

434
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,125
Shh!

435
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:53,333
See? They're already looking for us.

436
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,333
Just let me do the talking, Teun.

437
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,000
Follow me to the first floor.

438
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,083
Ah, yes.

439
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,250
- Mr. Visser.
- Oberst Berghof.

440
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,375
Please.

441
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:31,708
It's good you're here.

442
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:35,375
I take it you can tell me more
about the fugitive terrorist.

443
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,875
No. My son isn't a... No.

444
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,500
It was just a moment...

445
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,791
of carelessness.

446
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,791
- It was an accident.
- Yes.

447
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:50,750
- It was never his intention...
- No, no, we are here...

448
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,291
to say...

449
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:58,083
that he is deeply sorry.

450
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:02,750
And we hope that we
might be able to reach...

451
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,208
a compromise?

452
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:13,416
You know,
I hold deep respect for people like you.

453
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:15,875
Whether in war or peace,

454
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:18,875
your moral compass
always steers you in the right direction.

455
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,583
I value that in my own ranks too.

456
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:22,833
There's a job to do...

457
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:26,250
and I try to carry it out
with honor and in good conscience.

458
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,791
But not everyone is up to the task.

459
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:35,750
Very few people
are as righteous as you, Dr. Visser.

460
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:39,041
Thank you.

461
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:40,791
That is why...

462
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,333
um...

463
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:48,583
my son wants to turn himself in,

464
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,458
under two conditions.

465
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:53,416
First,

466
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,125
the other boys are to be released.
They are innocent, right?

467
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,250
And the second condition

468
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:04,291
is that Dirk receives
a sentence, naturally,

469
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,250
but a prison sentence,

470
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,541
a life sentence, if need be.

471
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,416
Instead... Instead of...

472
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:29,333
Let's go.
That man is playing games with you.

473
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:33,875
What did you say?

474
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,875
That his...

475
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:45,208
His night shift is about to begin.

476
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,083
What did she say?

477
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,208
That her father has to go to work.

478
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,958
No, no, before that.

479
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:12,250
She's afraid
that you're playing games with him.

480
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:22,500
You work for
our honorable Mayor Oostveen, don't you?

481
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:27,541
People like you and your father,

482
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,833
I am grateful to those
with such a great sense of duty.

483
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,375
Dr. Visser,

484
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:37,583
you've helped my sick and wounded soldiers
to the best of your ability.

485
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,666
Now let me help you.

486
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,458
I have to sentence your son.
There's nothing I can do about that.

487
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:51,750
But I will ensure
that his punishment is light.

488
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,750
You have my word.

489
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,541
It's for the best, Teun.

490
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:16,625
It'll be all right.

491
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:26,166
Under the table in the basement.

492
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,500
Give it to Janna.

493
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,125
Bye, sis.

494
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:09,083
Thanks.

495
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:15,083
I've found an address for Dirk.

496
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:16,416
He can go there tonight.

497
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,541
Do you know these?

498
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,708
Dirk's been arrested.

499
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,708
Please give me the photos.

500
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,500
- I'll give them to...
- To your friends?

501
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:40,666
Yes.

502
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:44,375
I'm sorry.
But those photos are very important.

503
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:48,375
You can have them
if you and your friends rescue Dirk.

504
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:49,708
Teun.

505
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,208
You have to give them to me.

506
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,708
I'll talk to them.

507
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,291
I 'm coming.

508
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:01,875
You can't.

509
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:07,375
Tonight at eight o'clock. Here.

510
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:21,041
Hey.

511
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,125
Why have we stopped?

512
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,666
We were supposed to have landed in Arnhem.

513
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,583
In Arnhem?

514
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,541
- That's a long way.
- Yes.

515
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:38,583
It will be over soon.
Antwerp has been liberated.

516
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:40,958
And the Canadians
are already in Zeelandic Flanders.

517
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,166
- What?
- What did he say?

518
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,208
The Canadians
are already over the Belgian border.

519
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:47,666
That's where we need to be.

520
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:51,125
Uh, how do we get there?

521
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:53,958
The Canadians are here?

522
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:54,916
Yeah.

523
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,416
And you lot are here.

524
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:58,916
Here.

525
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:03,708
So they are at the other side
of the islands.

526
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:08,750
Do you have a boat, here? Boat?

527
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,083
A boat?

528
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,458
It was seized.

529
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,500
Being out on the water is too risky.
We're staying here.

530
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:19,875
The Jerries know we crashed.

531
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:23,583
They'll be searching for us.
We can't stay in one place long.

532
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:26,166
It's too dangerous out there.
Especially with...

533
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,875
What?

534
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:34,458
We move out in the morning.

535
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:35,916
End of discussion.

536
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:08,708
So you're his sister.

537
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,125
Dirk should never have carried out
an attack on his own.

538
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,541
He threw a stone

539
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:19,791
that accidentally smashed a windscreen.

540
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:24,875
- I don't understand...
- Dirk volunteered of his own accord.

541
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,208
- He's 17.
- We're all in danger now.

542
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,875
Especially if he starts talking.

543
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,875
We need those photos.

544
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,375
You work at the town hall, right?

545
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,833
I can arrange things.

546
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:24,000
Anything you want. Russian stamps, or...

547
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:25,666
Or I can steal documents.

548
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,041
I'm looking for a map.

549
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:30,416
A tide chart for the Sloe.

550
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:34,208
Showing the dam and the marshlands.

551
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:36,583
And if I find the map, you'll help Dirk?

552
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,833
What do you think?

553
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:59,625
Is a 17 year old still a child?

554
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,041
Where were you at 17?

555
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,750
At a training camp in Bavaria.

556
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:07,833
Hmm.

557
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,416
Was that your own choice?

558
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:12,125
Yes.

559
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:20,541
This boy knew exactly what he was doing
when he joined the resistance.

560
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:23,541
I feel sorry for his father and sister

561
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,708
but I can't make any exceptions.

562
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:38,291
What if it's for the Jerries?

563
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,458
It's useless.
Maybe we should give ourselves up.

564
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:55,750
What?

565
00:57:57,291 --> 00:57:59,416
- Never.
- We're not giving ourselves up.

566
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,333
If we do that, we're as good as dead.

567
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:04,458
I'd rather drown.

568
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:07,208
That's easy for you to say,
you're going to die anyway.

569
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:09,958
Maybe, John.

570
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:11,833
But not today.

571
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:16,250
Now stand up. March out.

572
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:18,291
Move.

573
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:49,166
Okay, go.

574
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:26,750
Easy.

575
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:31,291
Easy.

576
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,708
Good work.

577
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:42,166
I'll go look for some food, sir.

578
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,000
A steak would be great.
Medium rare, please.

579
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:55,583
Yeah. Yeah.

580
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:28,666
Oh, gentlemen.

581
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,708
No!

582
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:39,458
- Yes!
- Whoo!

583
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:41,461
- There you go. Drink up.
- Cheers.

584
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:43,250
It's not bad.

585
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:45,166
No, it's good, man.

586
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,666
So, how many?

587
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:50,000
How many? What are you talking about?

588
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:52,416
- How many?
- How many women have you had?

589
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,625
A gentleman does not
disclose such matters.

590
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:57,708
More than three?

591
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Three?

592
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:02,625
More than ten?

593
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:07,041
What about you, Willy? Eh?

594
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,833
Young squire?

595
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,333
No?

596
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,500
Of course I have.

597
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:21,833
You have never.

598
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,541
- Not even with the girls in Ringway?
- Surely.

599
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:31,166
Jesus, man. We're going to die in a week
and you have never...

600
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,583
That, that is most, uh...

601
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:36,875
unfortunate.

602
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:42,625
Um, I don't think
there's anything worse than that.

603
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:45,333
Oh, God. Yes. Leave him alone.

604
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,833
I am not gonna die.

605
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,083
Henk.

606
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:36,833
Nigel?

607
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:46,916
John. In the bloody night, John.

608
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:49,000
They're gone.

609
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:51,375
Bloody traitors.

610
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:55,291
- The map, Henk.
- It's in there.

611
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:56,875
They took my life jacket.

612
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,125
- So they took everything.
- Boys, listen...

613
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:07,041
They're traitors, sir, bloody traitors!

614
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:08,125
Listen.

615
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:15,583
I need you both to go and get us a boat.

616
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:18,416
I'm staying here. I'll guard the house.

617
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,541
Yeah, right.

618
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:25,208
Sir, I'm not
leaving you here alone.

619
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:27,916
Yes, you are.

620
01:03:29,541 --> 01:03:30,625
Get us a boat.

621
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,833
That's an order.

622
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:50,958
We won't give up!

623
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:04,000
Stop!

624
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:08,583
Stop!

625
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:19,416
Stop!

626
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,125
Stop. Stop!

627
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,833
Calm down.

628
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:49,000
No!

629
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,416
You know what we want.

630
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:52,500
No. No!

631
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,833
Give us the names.

632
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,083
No! Stop.

633
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:27,791
Come on. Come on.

634
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:37,458
Henk.

635
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,583
Oh, God.

636
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,458
You've got to be kidding me.

637
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:52,583
I thought that Dutch people could swim!

638
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:21,666
Henk...

639
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:17,458
Fritz, look what I've found.

640
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,416
Don't touch.
Get your hands off me!

641
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,500
Careful!

642
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:28,666
There's water here.

643
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,000
Let go.

644
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:32,541
Come here. Come here.

645
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,125
The things I bloody...

646
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:39,416
Show me your hands.

647
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:42,750
Damn it. Stay still.

648
01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:44,333
Call yourselves soldiers?

649
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,083
If he makes another noise, just shoot him.

650
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:07,958
- Don't shoot. I'm alone.
- Shh!

651
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:10,291
Easy.

652
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,750
Easy.

653
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:17,166
Let me go
and I won't tell anyone I've seen you.

654
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:23,250
Easy, my friend. I'll do whatever you say.

655
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:35,625
Hermann?

656
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:37,958
Hermann, who's there?

657
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,750
Hey, Hermann!

658
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:56,833
Hermann, what's going on?

659
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:03,500
Hermann!

660
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:05,208
Fuck.

661
01:10:13,916 --> 01:10:15,041
Keep an eye on him.

662
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,791
- No, don't shoot.
- Hermann?

663
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:28,041
Hermann.

664
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:29,916
Hermann.

665
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:38,291
- Drop your weapon.
- Shoot, William.

666
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:41,805
It doesn't matter
what happens, just shoot.

667
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:43,000
Shut up.

668
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:44,250
Drop your weapon.

669
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,583
Shoot, William. Shoot. Take your shot.

670
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:47,541
Drop your weapon.

671
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:48,541
Shut up you...

672
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:50,750
Put the gun down, please.
Put the gun down.

673
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,708
Put the gun down now!

674
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,416
- Gun down.
- William.

675
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,041
- I don't have a clear shot.
- Doesn't matter, mate.

676
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:59,041
Squeeze the trigger. Just shoot!

677
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,045
- Take the shot, William!
- Put the gun down now.

678
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,083
Gun down now!

679
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:05,125
- Shoot!
- Just shut up.

680
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:08,625
Gun down now! Put the gun down! Now!

681
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:09,875
Gun down!

682
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,166
Will!

683
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:35,208
Will!

684
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:50,416
Will, you don't have to do this. Will!

685
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,666
No, please. Please don't shoot. Don't.

686
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:26,750
Find their addresses.

687
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,625
As soon as possible.

688
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:31,541
Five people, all men.

689
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:34,416
If there had been more,
he would have told me.

690
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,833
He tried to act tough for the first hour.

691
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:43,208
But then I increased the pressure
and he eventually named them all.

692
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:44,333
Good.

693
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,875
- Arrest and execute them immediately.
- Mm-hmm.

694
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:51,083
And the boy? What should we do with him?

695
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,625
No special treatment.

696
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:54,583
Good.

697
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:11,750
What?

698
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:14,291
This is crazy.

699
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:26,166
Henk.

700
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,708
It's going to be our last chance.

701
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:32,583
Let's get over. Just us.

702
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:43,625
Keep moving.

703
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,291
Don't look at me. Walk.

704
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:56,541
They've made your brother talk.
He's mentioned names.

705
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:04,458
And Dirk? What will become of him?

706
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:08,125
What will they do to him?

707
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:26,291
Don't move. Go forward.

708
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:27,958
Quickly.

709
01:15:28,416 --> 01:15:32,208
I said, don't move. Stand still.

710
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:33,958
Hey.

711
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,708
No. Please. Please don't.

712
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:39,625
Don't move!

713
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,083
Hands up.

714
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:14,041
There's no need to sit down.

715
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,708
It's a shame about the training camp.

716
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,291
Wasted effort.

717
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,208
Pack your things.

718
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,875
Report to the courtyard.

719
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:45,541
Dad!

720
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:48,625
Daddy.

721
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,750
They're going to shoot him.

722
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:58,541
Teun, who said? What do you mean?

723
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:01,416
- What can we do?
- Easy now, Teun. Easy now.

724
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:05,208
It'll be alright, you'll see.

725
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:31,913
Get in.

726
01:17:58,625 --> 01:18:00,916
LOCAL COMMAND

727
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:10,750
Halt, stop there!

728
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:12,958
- Papers, please.
- Yes.

729
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:19,791
Go on.

730
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:47,458
Oberst Berghof.

731
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:52,333
I need to speak to Colonel Berghof.

732
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:53,833
Oberst Berghof!

733
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,000
Oberst Berghof.

734
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:58,333
Please may I speak with you?

735
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:00,791
Please!

736
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:02,583
Please.

737
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:36,875
Approach.

738
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,916
Ready.

739
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:06,333
Aim.

740
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:16,916
Fire.

741
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:26,875
Stand down.

742
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:30,291
We need
to get your map to the Allies.

743
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:33,750
Otherwise everything
will have been in vain.

744
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:38,125
The German positions are on this side.

745
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:40,958
Here.

746
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:42,291
Here.

747
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,541
And here.

748
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:46,208
Your brother took photographs of them.

749
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:51,791
The Germans dug themselves in weeks ago.

750
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:54,791
Everything they've got
is aimed at the Sloedam.

751
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,166
And here, on the other side...

752
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:02,500
are the Canadians.

753
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:05,041
If they cross the dam...

754
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:08,083
there will be a huge massacre.

755
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,791
Their only chance is at high tide.

756
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:15,375
There's a fairway here,

757
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:16,666
through the mud...

758
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:19,833
to the other side.

759
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:22,375
So that they can attack from here.

760
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,666
Through this same fairway,

761
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,333
you can reach the Allies.

762
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:37,291
I can't do it.

763
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:46,291
There's a boat waiting in the mud.
By the Cornelisse farm.

764
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:05,541
Come on.

765
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,041
Hey.

766
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:20,708
No, wait. Hey.

767
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,375
Stop. ID, please.

768
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:35,375
You too.

769
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:41,041
Go on.

770
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:42,666
Open it.

771
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:03,958
Get out. Faster.

772
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,041
Come on, men.

773
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:09,000
Up. Keep going.

774
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:17,125
Faster. Keep going.

775
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:21,583
Faster.

776
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:25,583
Soldiers.

777
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,666
You are all tired...

778
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:34,958
sick, cold and wet.

779
01:26:36,208 --> 01:26:38,375
But we mustn't give up.

780
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:43,250
Walcheren is our stronghold.
Hitler's stronghold.

781
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:47,833
They will attack us with all their might.

782
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:51,625
But we will fight down to the last man.

783
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,166
We won't give up.

784
01:26:57,416 --> 01:26:58,500
Never!

785
01:27:38,666 --> 01:27:39,666
Teun.

786
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:42,208
Teun, there is no boat.

787
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:47,791
Keep looking.

788
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:00,750
Get out of the way.

789
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:03,791
Everybody out.

790
01:28:05,041 --> 01:28:06,166
All clear.

791
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:17,000
Bloody hell.

792
01:28:21,916 --> 01:28:23,041
- Hey.
- Not now.

793
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:25,583
Okay.

794
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:30,291
One thing's sure, we're all going to die.
Well, they're going to blow us to pieces.

795
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:32,875
We'll just have to
blow 'em up first then, won't we?

796
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:33,958
Hey.

797
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:35,916
Hey.

798
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,416
Cheers.

799
01:28:39,541 --> 01:28:41,291
Yeah, no trouble.

800
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:42,541
So, what are you?

801
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:43,833
- Um...
- Airborne?

802
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:46,875
Yeah. English. And you are a...

803
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:49,000
- Canuck.
- Far from home.

804
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,333
Yes.

805
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:51,916
- What's your name?
- Mm.

806
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:54,166
- Bill.
- I'm Will.

807
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,333
Hm! Nice to meet you, Will.

808
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:00,541
You hungry?

809
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:02,666
- Yeah?
- Yes.

810
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:04,791
I'll get you some food,
get you a new uniform.

811
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:55,375
Now?

812
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:57,916
Almost.

813
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:08,583
I'm sorry.

814
01:31:12,458 --> 01:31:13,833
It's not your fault.

815
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:18,083
I should have stopped him.

816
01:31:23,875 --> 01:31:25,541
It's what he wanted.

817
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:32,958
Thanks for coming along.

818
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:37,458
Come on.

819
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,541
Hey! Who goes there?

820
01:32:28,083 --> 01:32:29,083
Push.

821
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:34,583
Push.

822
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:44,958
There they are.

823
01:32:46,291 --> 01:32:47,375
Stay low.

824
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:56,708
Stand still.

825
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:01,583
Don't move.

826
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,666
We're getting reports.
The causeway's been blown.

827
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:12,750
How bad?

828
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,333
Heavily damaged.

829
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:17,833
We can only get across on foot.

830
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:19,291
And across the water?

831
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:23,333
We'll never get across
in our amphibian boats.

832
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:25,916
Too shallow. Too much mud.

833
01:33:28,666 --> 01:33:30,458
We can only go straight on.

834
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:34,000
That's suicide. We won't stand a chance.

835
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,333
Certainly not without air cover.

836
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:40,458
Prepare your men for tomorrow morning.

837
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:43,000
- Don't think about it, just do it.
- Yes, sir.

838
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:46,375
Come on. Go on, everyone.

839
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Come on.

840
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:49,625
Move up, gentlemen.

841
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,166
- Come on.
- Let's go.

842
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:56,291
- Come on.
- Move out. Come on.

843
01:35:27,916 --> 01:35:29,041
Get into position.

844
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:37,666
Everyone get ready to fire.

845
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:39,666
Get ready to fire.

846
01:35:43,791 --> 01:35:45,458
Get ready to fire.

847
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:18,666
Get down! Get down!

848
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:21,458
Get down on the ground!

849
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:39,750
Ah!

850
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,583
Move forward! Move forward!

851
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:49,041
Go! Go!

852
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:56,875
Move! Move!

853
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,458
Shoot for cover.

854
01:37:08,166 --> 01:37:09,208
Keep going.

855
01:37:12,041 --> 01:37:13,625
Will. Come on.

856
01:37:15,333 --> 01:37:16,833
Will, we've got to go.

857
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,000
We've got to move.

858
01:37:22,916 --> 01:37:24,583
Move! Move! Move!

859
01:37:26,125 --> 01:37:27,208
Take cover!

860
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:41,083
Soldiers, spread out!

861
01:37:42,583 --> 01:37:43,583
Spread out.

862
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:48,958
Come on!

863
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:50,083
Bill.

864
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:55,208
Ah!

865
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:06,875
Get cover!
Get cover right now.

866
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,250
Check your weapons!

867
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:33,083
Push on through.

868
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:35,166
Come on. Push on through.

869
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:03,333
Get that Bren up.

870
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,250
Get it up. Fire.

871
01:39:06,333 --> 01:39:07,458
Fire.

872
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:23,083
Push up! Push up!

873
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:34,125
Load.

874
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:40,833
Faster.

875
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:45,875
Move. Move! Look out.

876
01:39:47,166 --> 01:39:49,541
Come on. Let's get out there.

877
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:13,750
Marines, 8,000. Prepare to fire.

878
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:16,041
Fire.

879
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:17,500
Push forward.

880
01:40:26,666 --> 01:40:27,916
Move! Move!

881
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,125
Bill! We've got to get out of here.
We've got to go!

882
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:47,041
- Keep firing.
- Move. Move!

883
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:48,708
Keep your heads down.

884
01:40:48,791 --> 01:40:49,875
Follow me.

885
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:57,291
Here. Give me your hand.

886
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,750
This is madness.

887
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:11,750
Move! Move! Move!

888
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:17,708
Move up.

889
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:21,541
Hey!

890
01:41:34,583 --> 01:41:35,666
Joe.

891
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:36,916
Bill.

892
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:40,083
No!

893
01:41:42,375 --> 01:41:44,375
Joe!

894
01:41:49,666 --> 01:41:51,541
Now. Get him.

895
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:52,958
Move it!

896
01:41:57,708 --> 01:41:59,250
Retreat.

897
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:00,541
Bill, let's go!

898
01:42:00,625 --> 01:42:02,166
- Go.
- Retreat!

899
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:04,791
- We've got to get out of here.
- Move!

900
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,458
Fall back.

901
01:42:08,958 --> 01:42:10,250
Retreat.

902
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:11,333
Retreat!

903
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,750
Move, move, move!

904
01:42:26,083 --> 01:42:27,541
Cease fire.

905
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:29,750
Cease fire.

906
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,250
Cease fire.

907
01:44:54,041 --> 01:44:55,541
Take this to the major.

908
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:04,250
Sir.

909
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:52,416
We'll have an hour and a half
before it dries up.

910
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,375
How long until we can get across?

911
01:45:55,333 --> 01:45:59,250
We can cross in four hours.
Then the water will be high enough.

912
01:46:00,958 --> 01:46:04,625
You'll come ashore here. We'll attack them
and you'll hit them on the flank.

913
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:07,875
I'll have my men prepared for the attack.

914
01:47:09,708 --> 01:47:12,083
Come. Quickly.

915
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,375
Come. Quickly.

916
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:15,875
Quickly.

917
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:49,041
Keep firing.

918
01:47:54,708 --> 01:47:57,750
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!

919
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:10,583
Stand up.

920
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,625
Stand up.

921
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,375
Stand up, now.

922
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:24,041
No!

923
01:48:24,125 --> 01:48:25,291
Shoot.

924
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,625
Shoot.

925
01:48:54,916 --> 01:48:56,125
Pull out.

926
01:49:10,625 --> 01:49:12,041
Go! Go! Go!

927
01:51:16,458 --> 01:51:17,458
Hmm?

928
01:52:55,041 --> 01:52:56,041
Move!

929
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:25,500
Hey.

930
01:53:26,041 --> 01:53:27,125
Bill.

931
01:53:52,375 --> 01:53:54,708
Get in! Hurry up!

932
01:53:57,125 --> 01:53:58,208
Get out!

933
01:53:58,291 --> 01:54:00,083
Keep going!

934
01:54:08,083 --> 01:54:09,083
Keep going!

935
01:54:14,333 --> 01:54:16,666
Fritz, hurry up. Get in.

936
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:18,833
Fritz, hurry up. Get in!

937
01:54:24,458 --> 01:54:28,416
Open up! Open the fucking door!

938
01:54:30,666 --> 01:54:32,541
Did you think we forgot about you?

939
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:35,500
Lie down!

940
01:54:38,958 --> 01:54:39,958
Lie down!

941
01:54:40,625 --> 01:54:41,666
Ah!

942
01:54:43,083 --> 01:54:44,333
It's your turn.

943
01:54:46,125 --> 01:54:47,166
Huh?

944
01:57:05,958 --> 01:57:07,000
Hey.

945
01:57:07,916 --> 01:57:09,166
You'll be fine.

946
01:58:31,791 --> 01:58:32,958
Clear!

947
01:59:58,291 --> 02:00:02,791
On 7 November 1944
Walcheren was liberated.

948
02:00:02,875 --> 02:00:09,875
The Allied ships
could now reach the port of Antwerp.

949
02:00:09,958 --> 02:00:16,916
The final offensive
against Germany could begin.

950
02:00:19,625 --> 02:00:21,541
At the battle of the Scheldt

951
02:00:21,625 --> 02:00:27,416
3, 231 Allies, 4,250 Germans
and 2,283 civilians lost their lives.

952
02:00:30,125 --> 02:00:35,750
The Netherlands was liberated
on May 5th, 1945.

952
02:00:36,305 --> 02:01:36,342
