<i>We have breaking news.</i>

4
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,698
<i>It happened just a few
moments ago apparently.</i>

5
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,235
<i>We have very little
information available.</i>

6
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:28,139
<i>We have, I understand,
an eyewitness on the phone right now.</i>

7
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:29,539
Rog.

of the plaza at 8:52.</i>

at this point,</i>

10
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:59,469
<i>we don't know about
injuries in the building...</i>

11
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:01,072
What the
hell happened?

12
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:02,706
A bomb.

13
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,141
I think.

14
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:06,244
So sad.

15
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,046
- <i>There was a loud sound...</i>
- Rog, I got to, uh...

16
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,751
<i>I can only describe it as, it sounded
like a missile, not an airplane.</i>

17
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:16,586
<i>Then there was
a loud explosion and...</i>

18
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:57,661
Wanna go higher?

19
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,198
You got it!

20
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,973
Let it in there!

21
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,313
<i>So, the Red Sox
with two down on a base hit.</i>

22
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,647
- First time through the order?
- Third.

23
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,317
Third?

24
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,484
- What inning is this?
- Fifth.

25
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,954
Oh, boy.

26
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,002
Your hands are... disgusting.

27
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,211
Let me do it.

28
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,088
Disgusting?

29
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:36,533
Wow.

30
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,946
Just breathe.

that one up down the line.</i>

<i>That's ducking in!
It falls in!</i>

33
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:07,465
- What's the inning of that game?
- Third.

34
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,867
- Let's go!
- Oh!

35
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,403
Come on, Henry!

36
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:13,938
You got it, you got it!

37
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,474
Dive, dive, dive!

38
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:19,010
- He's out!
- Ooh!

39
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,612
Hey, how do you say "dive"?

40
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,917
- Dive?
- It's a tough one.

41
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:32,223
We'll take third ball now.

42
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,225
Let's do it. Whoo!

43
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:38,896
Come on.

44
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:44,168
- Go Marcus!
- Here we go. Nice little hit. Here we go.

45
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,873
Whoo!

46
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,573
Ball!

47
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,877
That's okay.
Good eye, good eye!

48
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:57,782
Alright, Marcus.
Wait for your pitch, buddy.

49
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:59,649
<i>This damage with two outs...</i>

50
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,285
Shit.

51
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:04,088
Shit.

52
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:11,796
Strike one!

53
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,330
It's alright.

54
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,398
It's alright.

55
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,599
Goddamn thing.

56
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:32,682
Strike two!

57
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,074
Come on. Let's go.

58
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:05,182
Alright, folks.
That's the game.

59
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:08,752
Why don't we all
head to our cars.

60
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,625
- Okay, let's go.
- Molly!

61
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,994
- Hey.
- Hey.

62
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,829
- What was that?
- I don't know.

63
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,664
- I don't know what that was.
- I'm gonna take the kids home, okay?

64
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,601
Okay, yeah.
My truck's up on Main Street.

65
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,065
Okay. Alright, everybody in.
Let's go.

66
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,720
I'll go with Dad.

67
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:31,041
Okay. Straight home.
Lee? Lee?

68
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,689
- Hey. You alright?
- Yeah, good.

69
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,160
Your brother say anything
going on at the base?

70
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:52,630
Not that I know of. He just called.
Let me call him back.

71
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:54,331
Alright. Yeah,
let me know.

72
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,884
My truck's up there.

73
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,738
Don't worry.

74
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,533
Wait here.

75
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,512
Ronnie, what do we got?

76
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:43,914
We got units headed out there
now, EMS and fire.

77
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:47,051
- Whereabouts?
- I think out by Walker's farm.

78
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,770
What's wrong?

79
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,912
It's okay, honey.
It's okay, honey bunny.

80
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,746
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

81
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,782
- Mom?
- Yeah.

82
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:21,952
What is happening?

83
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,888
Oh!

84
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:28,692
Oh, my God!

85
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:33,364
It's okay.
It's okay. We're okay.

86
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:36,033
- That's Dad. That's Dad!
- Where, where, where?

87
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,601
Mom. Mom!

88
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:39,203
Oh, my God!

89
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,231
- You're okay, baby.
- I'm okay.

90
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:09,033
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.

91
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,028
I'm okay.

92
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:39,863
I'm okay.

93
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,100
We were on Main Street
and, um... I don't...

94
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,502
Are you there?

95
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:48,472
Mom?

96
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,123
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

97
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,525
hallowed be thy name.

98
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:13,630
Thy kingdom come, thy will be
done, on earth as it is in heaven.

99
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:17,000
Give us this day our daily...

100
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:24,001
It's okay. Shh.

101
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,148
It's Dad!

102
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:37,347
Down. Get down.

103
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,335
Let's go.

104
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,429
Wait here.

105
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,312
I'm going back in...

106
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,981
Stay here.

107
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:13,730
Run!

108
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:04,248
Shh!

109
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:07,151
Baby, please. Shh!

110
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:12,722
Baby, please.

111
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:17,527
No. Please.

112
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:32,510
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.

113
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:35,545
It's okay.

114
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:46,891
It's okay.

115
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,794
It's okay.

116
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:06,604
Go.

117
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,118
Jump.

118
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:44,335
You can't stay.

119
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:51,175
I don't know why you came all the
way up here, but you can't stay.

120
00:24:55,246 --> 00:24:56,714
Up?

121
00:24:56,847 --> 00:25:01,819
There's not enough food... water.
There's not enough anything.

122
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:07,057
How do you know
we traveled up?

123
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:10,928
There's nothing I can do.
You won't survive.

124
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:18,002
Show me your face.

125
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,139
I can't help you.

126
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:26,443
Please, I can't help you.

127
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,250
Emmett?

128
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,455
Emmett?

129
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:04,882
Please.

130
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,196
Breathe, baby.

131
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,025
How does it work?

132
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:33,664
There's three feet
of concrete.

133
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:37,167
They'd have to be
right above us to hear.

134
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:45,609
What is it?
Some kind of...

135
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:50,681
Some kind of feedback
from the microphone?

136
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:53,550
It just works.
I don't know.

137
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:58,088
Just never seen one
dead before.

138
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:02,993
How is he?

139
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:05,729
He's, um...

140
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,769
Well, it didn't
reach the bone.

141
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:17,107
But that wrap
won't last.

142
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:36,761
I'm sorry.

143
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,299
- For what?
- The boys.

144
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,739
- I assume...
- That day.

145
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:53,610
And Nora?

146
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:56,113
Eleven weeks ago.

147
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:01,084
She was sick.

148
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:08,125
Held out as long as
we could in the house.

149
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:10,727
But the pain just...

150
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:17,367
It was when she
started screaming...

151
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,504
we had to come here.

152
00:30:23,908 --> 00:30:25,475
That was smart.

153
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:29,546
It wasn't enough.

154
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:41,525
Can I ask you
a question?

155
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:48,398
When you saw
the flame...

156
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:51,635
night after night...

157
00:30:56,074 --> 00:30:58,108
Did you know
it was him?

158
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,181
Yes.

159
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:10,788
And did you ever think
to come for us?

160
00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:17,194
No.

161
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,537
The people that are left...

162
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:30,273
what they've become...

163
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,678
You don't know, do you?

164
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:38,816
Well, I do.

165
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:44,421
They're not a kind of
people worth saving.

<i>♪ Beyond the sea ♪</i>

168
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:58,069
What is it?

169
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,040
- What is it?
- Music!

170
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:07,711
<i>♪ My lover stands On golden
sand And watches... ♪</i>

171
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,480
- It's...
- "Beyond the Sea."

172
00:32:10,614 --> 00:32:12,784
- Have you heard this?
- Yes.

173
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,829
No. Dad would've heard this.

174
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:19,690
It's the same song. It's been playing
over and over the last four months.

175
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:21,525
You're lying!

176
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,361
My Dad used the radio every day!

177
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:29,199
- What's she saying?
- She thinks he would've heard it.

178
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,734
Who?

179
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:32,770
Lee.

180
00:32:40,011 --> 00:32:41,112
It's the valley.

181
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:45,348
It's the valley.
I tried the radio from our house too,

182
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:48,485
but we never heard anything
until we got up here.

183
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:51,354
Your dad was never
gonna make it work.

184
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:55,225
You're nothing like him!

185
00:32:59,864 --> 00:33:01,766
Does this mean that
there are more people?

186
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,568
- I don't know, baby. I don't.
- No!

187
00:33:05,136 --> 00:33:06,670
There's nothing left.

188
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:10,373
I told you,
there is nothing left.

189
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,447
I want you
gone tomorrow.

190
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,437
It's not a song.

191
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:23,730
On the radio.

192
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,525
Beyond The Sea... Right?

193
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,569
It's not a song...

194
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,862
It's a signal.

195
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,741
They're telling us where to look.

196
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,661
I looked up the radio station.

197
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:40,789
...where the song is coming from.

198
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:51,967
It's an island!

199
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,969
I can follow the train tracks...

200
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,265
It's not even one day.

201
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:01,518
Then I can find a boat.

202
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,229
You can't do this.

203
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:08,275
If I can find the song.
Where it's coming from...

204
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,320
I can use this...

205
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,447
to change this...

206
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,825
into this!

207
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:22,164
Mom, will never... let you go.

208
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,420
I can save them.

209
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:32,132
I can save us.

210
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:33,675
I'll tell her.

211
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,220
Mom... I'll tell her.

212
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:40,057
Please don't do this!

213
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,936
I need to try.

214
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:45,020
Why?

215
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,522
Because Dad would.

216
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:49,316
And look what happened to him.

217
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,352
You have to
find her for me.

218
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:18,222
She's gone to get help, and I need you to
go and find her and bring her back to me.

219
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:21,158
- Alright, listen to me.
- Please, Emmett, I'm begging you.

220
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:23,526
- Evelyn...
- I'm begging you. We were friends.

221
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,628
Emmett, please.

222
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:29,800
Lee is gone.

223
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,941
Now he's gone.

224
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,846
It's a shame.

225
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:43,914
Because if he were here...

226
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:47,051
he'd look you right in the
eye, and he'd tell you

227
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:52,589
that his little girl is absolutely
the kind of person worth saving.

228
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:59,897
So please
go find her...

229
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,567
and bring her
back to me.

230
00:43:26,623 --> 00:43:28,058
Go!

231
00:43:57,254 --> 00:43:58,655
Alright, listen to me.

232
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:02,059
We stay here until they're
gone, and then we go.

233
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:03,894
You understand?

234
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:08,632
She can't hear.

235
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,634
You can't hear.

236
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:12,035
Shit!

237
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,511
I'm taking you home.
We'll wait here until they're gone.

238
00:44:21,712 --> 00:44:23,547
Goddamn it!

239
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:39,805
Enunciate... Remember?

240
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:46,703
I'm...

241
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:51,275
taking you... back.

242
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:55,112
Hey.

243
00:44:55,245 --> 00:44:58,883
They heard... the shot.

244
00:44:59,016 --> 00:45:00,417
Okay?

245
00:45:03,654 --> 00:45:04,856
No!

246
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:07,624
You can't do this.

247
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,210
Help me.

248
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:13,363
Enough, please. Enough.

249
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:17,134
I'm taking you home!

250
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:21,680
What home?

251
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:29,438
You said... your wife...

252
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,815
Hey, don't...

253
00:45:31,482 --> 00:45:35,319
Do not...
talk about my wife!

254
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:41,033
You said...

255
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:45,746
...that you could not do enough.

256
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:51,585
Now you can.

257
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:49,429
I found a boat.

258
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:54,661
Don't go.

259
00:49:56,872 --> 00:49:59,041
I will be right back.

260
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:01,668
A matter of hours.

261
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:04,004
But the baby, I don't know how...

262
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:06,256
I showed you how to do it.

263
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,385
Stay calm.

264
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:13,639
You have everything you need.

265
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,934
Everything.

266
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:19,394
Please...

267
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:23,732
Look...

268
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:26,151
If I don't go...

269
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:29,821
Soon you'll be in a lot of pain.

270
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:32,533
And I won't know...

271
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:40,374
...I won't lose you too.

272
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:46,922
Breathe...

273
00:50:48,266 --> 00:50:49,499
Okay?

274
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:56,056
I'll be right back.

275
00:53:46,077 --> 00:53:49,579

01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,620
Hey.

282
01:00:05,089 --> 01:00:07,458
It's okay. It's okay.

283
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:10,627
Hey. Look at me.

284
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:22,332
Hey.

285
01:07:33,871 --> 01:07:35,840
Baby. Marcus.

286
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:38,675
Marcus! Marcus, wake up!

287
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:42,659
Oh! Thank you.

288
01:10:52,837 --> 01:10:54,704
You heard the song.

289
01:10:55,572 --> 01:10:57,174
You figured it out.

290
01:10:59,143 --> 01:11:00,277
She did.

291
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:07,617
- I thought she was...
- Figured it out.

292
01:11:13,924 --> 01:11:17,094
I'm not sure anyone here
can actually believe it.

293
01:11:18,728 --> 01:11:22,133
I think most people had
finally given up hope.

294
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,568
Been a long time.

295
01:11:26,603 --> 01:11:28,105
How long?

296
01:11:35,513 --> 01:11:37,014
That day.

297
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:43,054
We got here
the same way as you.

298
01:11:46,991 --> 01:11:51,628
We were in the city when we
heard the hurricane sirens.

299
01:11:52,997 --> 01:11:56,233
Once they knew
they couldn't swim...

300
01:11:56,367 --> 01:12:00,304
the National Guard were told to
start loading people onto boats.

301
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:03,908
Any boat that
they could find.

302
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:09,780
So as soon as people saw
the first one get out safe...

303
01:12:13,017 --> 01:12:14,118
Well...

304
01:12:15,618 --> 01:12:18,655
everyone just started
pushing forward.

305
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:24,028
And that's when
they started screaming.

306
01:12:27,164 --> 01:12:31,802
They had 12 boats lined
up on the dock that day.

307
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,672
Only two got out.

308
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,349
Anyway, you're
here now.

309
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,785
A new day.

310
01:12:48,618 --> 01:12:50,354
And where are you
coming from?

311
01:12:51,621 --> 01:12:54,291
Ah, just over
the Appalachian ridge.

312
01:12:54,425 --> 01:12:55,960
And how long
did it take?

313
01:12:57,328 --> 01:12:58,929
Just under two days.

314
01:12:59,063 --> 01:13:01,265
That's determination.

315
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:04,401
It's necessity.

316
01:13:05,803 --> 01:13:07,204
To get help?

317
01:13:10,407 --> 01:13:11,775
No.

318
01:13:13,811 --> 01:13:15,712
To give it.

319
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:48,812
He said he'll do it.

320
01:13:55,419 --> 01:13:56,787
Yes.

321
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:59,023
He said yes.

322
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,261
Thank you.

323
01:14:11,769 --> 01:14:13,736
I wanted to say...

324
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:17,841
I'm sorry...

325
01:14:19,476 --> 01:14:20,945
I doubted you.

326
01:14:22,846 --> 01:14:24,381
I was wrong.

327
01:14:31,021 --> 01:14:33,057
And you were right.

328
01:14:35,693 --> 01:14:37,394
I'm nothing like him.

329
01:14:41,799 --> 01:14:43,234
You are.

330
01:16:42,252 --> 01:16:43,287
Both.

331
01:16:55,767 --> 01:16:57,067
Get inside.

332
01:16:57,601 --> 01:16:59,269
Get inside!

333
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:01,605
Get inside!

334
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:24,421
Stay down! Get down!

Hey, door's locked.
You got a key?

336
01:19:05,028 --> 01:19:06,129
Where is it?

337
01:19:06,263 --> 01:19:09,066
We went too fast.
What if we lost it?

338
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,567
Give me the key.

339
01:19:11,435 --> 01:19:13,670
Jesus Christ,
it went back!

340
01:19:14,371 --> 01:19:15,672
- No, no, no.
- My family.

341
01:19:15,807 --> 01:19:16,808
Alright.
Listen to me.

342
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:19,243
I have to get back
to my family.
