00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,435
When I look back on my childhood,

3
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:09,189
I wonder how my brothers and I
managed to survive at all.

4
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,358
It was, of course, a miserable childhood.

5
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:14,736
The happy childhood
is hardly worth your while.

6
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:17,364
Worse than the ordinary
miserable childhood...

7
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:19,407
is the miserable Irish childhood.

8
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:25,372
And worse yet is the miserable
Irish Catholic childhood.

9
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,141
You beautiful wee thing.

10
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:47,268
You are. Look at you.

11
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:49,270
So gorgeous.

12
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:53,316
What is it?

13
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,569
It's a beautiful wee girl, Mrs. Leibowitz.

14
00:01:56,653 --> 00:02:01,241
After four boys. Can you believe it?
A wee girl.

15
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:03,326
What name is it, Malachy?

16
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,620
It's Margaret Mary.

17
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:07,622
Oh, she's so beautiful, Minnie.

18
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:11,292
Brown hair and blue eyes.

19
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:14,421
Just like her mom.

20
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:16,756
Beautiful wee thing.

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,259
Aren't you?

22
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,680
Come on, Eugene.

23
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:27,767
Oliver, come on. Splash.
Eugene, come on. Stop crying.

24
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,436
Good boy.

25
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,816
We're in the bath. Bubbles.
Don't cry, Eugene. Don't cry.

26
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:38,862
- Hey, Eugene, look at my bum. Ooh.
- Malachy, stop showing your bum.

27
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:40,864
I'm only trying to make them laugh.

28
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:44,492
Come on, Oliver. Come on. Stop crying.

29
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:18,067
Sweet Jesus in heaven, Malachy.

30
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:26,284
She's awful quiet, Angela.

31
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:40,798
A wee bit cold.

32
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:05,406
I'll get Mrs. Leibowitz.

33
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,867
Everyone loved little Margaret.

34
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,955
Dad said there must have been a holiday
in heaven the day this baby was made.

35
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:13,998
Dad said he would get a job soon...

36
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:18,670
and buy her dresses of silk
and shoes with silver buckles.

37
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:21,255
Poor little Margaret.

38
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,509
Just a few days in this world
and she was taken back...

39
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:27,553
by the same angels who brought her here.

40
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:33,726
- God, look at these twins.
- Stop crying, Ollie.

41
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,728
Eugene, please.

42
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:39,232
Frankie, I can't do this.
Where do I put the pin?

43
00:04:39,315 --> 00:04:42,026
Me dad said he was going for cigarettes,

44
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,154
and the twins just screamed and screamed.

45
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:48,866
Thank God for Mrs. Leibowitz
who lived upstairs.

46
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:58,001
Boys, oh, my. What happened to you, huh?

47
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:00,628
Where's your mother? What do you want?

48
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:03,339
We've got no dinner.

49
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,470
Now eat just a little bit more.

50
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:12,807
Come on, Angela. You have to eat.

51
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,518
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

52
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,773
Come on. Come on.

53
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,742
Mommy.

54
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,952
Oh, my God.

55
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:35,955
The children are naked, Delia.

56
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:37,957
Where did Angela get such filthy habits?

57
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,835
Her mother was always spotless.

58
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:45,715
Yech! The stink is awful!

59
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:48,426
It's the twins. Their arses are shitty.

60
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:51,471
It's a mouth like a sewer
you have. No wonder.

61
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:53,473
With a father from the North of Ireland...

62
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:54,867
with his funny manner
and his Protestant ways.

63
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:57,977
You could go to hell saying a thing
like that. Where is your father?

64
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,979
He went for cigarettes.

65
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:03,816
- Two days ago.
- I'll break his face, I swear.

66
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:07,945
Dad will be home soon.

67
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,114
Come on, Oliver. Come on, Eugene.

68
00:06:10,198 --> 00:06:13,701
Get paper and a pen, Delia.
We have a letter to write.

69
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:29,675
My aunts wrote to my mam's mother...

70
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,886
to send money for the tickets.

71
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,263
We must have been the only
Irish family in history...

72
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:38,601
to be saying good-bye to
the Statue of Liberty instead of hello.

73
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:43,981
We were going back to Ireland
where there was no work...

74
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:47,109
and people were dying
of the starvation and the damp.

75
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:51,197
It made no sense to me,
but what did I know.

76
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,284
I was only five going on six.

77
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,700
Christ, look at that coat.

78
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:37,702
Get you buttoned up.

79
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:39,704
There we are now.

80
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:41,706
I'll take him to the lavatories,

81
00:07:41,747 --> 00:07:43,708
then I'm off to see
the I.R.A. man for me money.

82
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:45,918
Francis, you can come with me
for the company, eh?

83
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:48,045
I'll be needing him to help me here.

84
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:50,840
Won't I be needing him
to help me carry all the money?

85
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:54,468
All right, Frankie, you can
go with your pop. Malachy!

86
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:57,471
Malachy, don't go to the lavatory there.

87
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,473
- I can't stop.
- Peeing all over me.

88
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:01,434
It's coming out.

89
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,103
Da, Da, wait for me. I wanna go.

90
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:09,066
No record?

91
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,902
But I did my bit for Ireland.

92
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:14,196
I fought with the Flying Columns
during the Troubles.

93
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,198
Had a price on my head.

94
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:18,868
Had to be smuggled to America.

95
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:23,080
There's no record
of your service here. None.

96
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:25,499
But I have a wife and four children.

97
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,961
I'm raising my sons to love Ireland.

98
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:32,506
Look. Please.

99
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,635
We have nothing.

100
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:39,013
I'm sorry. We can't
be handing out money...

101
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:41,307
to every man who wanders in here...

102
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,810
saying he did his bit for Ireland.

103
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:46,937
I'll look into your claim.

104
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,315
I'll let you know what turns up.

105
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:52,693
Here's money for the bus
back into the city.

106
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:56,989
You couldn't add to that
to make the price of a pint, could you?

107
00:08:57,072 --> 00:08:59,283
It's the drink you're after, is it?

108
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:02,077
One pint is hardly a drink.

109
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:06,165
You'd make that child walk back
into Dublin because you're after a pint?

110
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:09,168
Remember this, Francis,
this is the new Ireland.

111
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:12,338
Wee men in wee chairs
with wee bits of paper.

112
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,341
I think you should leave.
Declan, the door.

113
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,343
And don't bother coming back.

114
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:19,345
This is the Ireland men died for, is it?

115
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:22,348
Come on, Frankie. Free, my arse.

116
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:26,519
We're not handing out money
to support the Guinness family.

117
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:32,733
He wanted to marry her off
to the King of Sicily.

118
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:36,737
But the beautiful young Wilgefortis,

119
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,074
she didn't want to be marrying
no scabby old man, did she?

120
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:42,076
So, she prayed to God for help.

121
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,078
And do you know what he did, Frankie?

122
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:46,080
No, what did he do?

123
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:48,082
He grew a moustache
and a beard on her face.

124
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:50,125
- He didn't.
- He did.

125
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:07,017
Malachy, move away from that window.

126
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:09,979
Frank, take Eugene,
and don't forget your bag.

127
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:14,358
Put your coat on.
Malachy, put your coat on now.

128
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:17,069
I'm telling you I'll kick you so hard.

129
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:24,410
Here. There you go.

130
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:27,579
Oliver's been sick on my jumper.

131
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:31,250
Hello, Mam.

132
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:37,631
Oh, come on.

133
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,885
This is Malachy.

134
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:44,930
Mrs. Sheehan, pleased to meet you.

135
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,475
And Aggie.

136
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,561
Hi, Aggie. How are you?

137
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:55,899
And Pat.

138
00:10:58,027 --> 00:10:59,903
Hi, Pat.

139
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:09,204
What are you staring at?

140
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:11,832
Nothing.

141
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:17,588
Grandma said
she had no room for us in her house,

142
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:20,132
so she gave us 10 shillings
for two weeks' rent...

143
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:22,176
in an upstairs room in Windmill Street,

144
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:24,386
near my mam's sister Aggie.

145
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:32,895
- Mind yourself, Mrs. Sheehan.
- Look at that.

146
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:35,647
- I'll take the weight.
- Why is the heart on fire?

147
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:37,983
It's the sacred heart of Jesus.

148
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:41,153
Don't these children
know anything about their religion?

149
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:43,739
Ah, mom, it's different in America.

150
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:47,326
The Sacred Heart is everywhere.
Even in America.

151
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:51,288
There's no excuse
for that kind of ignorance.

152
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:53,415
Look. That's the Baby Jesus.

153
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:56,835
And if you ever need anything,
you should pray to him.

154
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:59,087
Will you tell Jesus that we're hungry?

155
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:01,131
Shut up!

156
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:28,575
- Ma!
- Ma!

157
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,999
They're biting me!

158
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:42,881
- Mom, I'm bleeding!
- Hold your noise now.

159
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:45,384
Look! Look at Malachy!
His arm's all bloody!

160
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:47,386
It's the fleas, Angela.
They're everywhere.

161
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:51,390
- Malachy, out of the bed.
- Jesus, will we get no rest?

162
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:56,311
- Malachy, come on. Pull.
- Let's take the mattress downstairs.

163
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:58,897
- Pull, Malachy, pull.
- Come on. Come to me.

164
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:03,402
- Get the mattress downstairs.
- There's fleas on the floor!

165
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:06,154
- That's it, on the ground.
- Ouch!

166
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:08,258
Malachy, we're surely gonna
catch our death out here...

167
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:10,200
and you'll be getting pneumonia.

168
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:13,245
Me dad said
that if a man could jump like a flea,

169
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:15,289
one leap would take him
halfway to the moon.

170
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,875
Once a flea has bit a human being,
the smell of blood is too much for them.

171
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,169
They're ready for the lunatic asylum.

172
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:23,439
They were brought over by the English,
to keep us up at night...

173
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,799
and drive us out of our wits entirely.

174
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:28,343
Because the English knew that the fleas,

175
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,429
they multiply faster than the Hindus.

176
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,889
- What's the water for, Dad?
- They do. They do!

177
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:34,891
I wouldn't put it past the English.

178
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:37,829
St. Patrick drove the snakes out of
Ireland; the English brought the fleas.

179
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:40,731
And the damp.

180
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:42,691
We loved our dad's stories.

181
00:13:52,242 --> 00:13:55,203
Hey, wait a minute. I need some coal.

182
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,789
I've got a docket here
from St. Vincent de Paul.

183
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,211
Mister, please.

184
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:18,518
Francis. Fra-put that down.

185
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:20,562
Don't pick coal off the road.

186
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:22,647
We're not beggars.

187
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:29,488
It's terrible. Look.

188
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:31,531
No pride, Frankie.

189
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,495
Come on!

190
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,835
I can't believe you.

191
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:46,338
This baby's sick,
and he needs a hot drink.

192
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:51,176
Now, if you're too grand
to pick coal off the road, I'm not.

193
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:58,141
Frankie. Malachy!

194
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,537
Okay, come on. Let's go.

195
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:22,415
Oh, shit!

196
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:28,588
Malachy, come on.

197
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:46,648
Angela, come on.

198
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:54,447
It's a rabbit she is, that Angela.

199
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:57,951
I don't see why we should
be paying for her mistakes.

200
00:15:57,993 --> 00:16:01,246
Five born and one gone and so useless
she can't even scrub a floor.

201
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:03,665
Go easy with the sugar.
We're not millionaires.

202
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:05,792
She was always angry, was Aunt Aggie.

203
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,462
Me dad said it was a good thing she
didn't own the stable in Bethlehem...

204
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:13,758
or the Holy Family would be wandering
the world still crumbling with hunger.

205
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:16,136
I swear the skinny fella's
the image of his father.

206
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:19,097
Aye, with the odd look
and the sour puss and all.

207
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,101
I think this fella likes me.
'Tis Al Jolson he thinks I am.

208
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:25,228
I think we'll keep this little fella.

209
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:28,398
- No, he's our brother!
- That's Eugene.

210
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:31,026
- You can't keep him.
- Don't bother.

211
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:34,779
I wouldn't want anything that was half
Limerick and half North of Ireland.

212
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:38,950
- You should be so lucky.
- Don't worry. I'll have me own someday.

213
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:41,328
If I have to crawl to Lourdes
on me two bended knees.

214
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:44,623
Oh, did you bang your foot?
Show me your foot.

215
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,361
I'll go down to Thompsons
the undertakers...

216
00:17:14,402 --> 00:17:18,907
to see about the coffin and the carriage.

217
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,994
The St. Vincent de Paul Society
will surely pay for that.

218
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,038
God knows.

219
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,057
Oh, son.

220
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:27,016
Jesus, I said to meself,
I have so much gas in my system,

221
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,102
'tis a great pity to waste it.

222
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:32,480
So I shove a pipe up my arse,
light a match to it...

223
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:36,025
and there I have a fine flame
ready to boil water in any billy can.

224
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:38,319
The English come from trenches...

225
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:41,030
to pay me any amount of money
to boil their water.

226
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:43,384
That's no story to be telling
in the presence of a dead child.

227
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:46,995
'Tis better than sitting with a long face.

228
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:50,957
I made so much money in the trenches
that I was able to bribe the generals,

229
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,252
who didn't normally
give a fiddler's fart about the Irish,

230
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,422
to let me out of the army,
and off I went to Paris,

231
00:18:57,463 --> 00:18:59,424
where I had a fine time drinking wine...

232
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:02,635
with the models and artists
and talkin' the lingo.

233
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:08,725
You think that's funny, do you?
I had a great time over there.

234
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:53,853
Requiem aeternam dona ei,
Domine, et luxperpetua luceat ei.

235
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:56,522
Requiescat in pace.

236
00:19:56,606 --> 00:20:00,026
Anima eius, et anime omnium
fidelium defunctorum,

237
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:04,113
per misericordiam Dei,
requiescant in pacem.

238
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:08,201
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.

239
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:11,120
Amen.

240
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:36,312
I don't know why we can't keep Oliver.

241
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:39,357
I don't know why they sent him
away in a box like my sister.

242
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:45,947
It's not right.

243
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,742
I wish I could say something to someone.

244
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:06,259
Dad said he was going
to the Labor Exchange to get the dole.

245
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:10,012
He'd be home by noon, he said,
and he'd have rashers and eggs and tea.

246
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:19,313
He wasn't home by noon...

247
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:21,399
- or 1.00...
- On your feet.

248
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:23,985
Or 2.00...

249
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:28,948
or anytime before the sun
went down that day in May.

250
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:38,499
Fight! Fight!

251
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,377
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

252
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:58,352
Come here. Stop! Quit that now!
Quit! Stop, I said!

253
00:21:58,436 --> 00:22:00,354
Quit now!

254
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:02,815
You little hooligan.

255
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:05,610
Is that the kind of behavior
you brought from America? Is it?

256
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:08,571
Well, you come on with me.

257
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,823
I'll put the fighting out of you, boy.

258
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:13,618
My little Yankee Doodle Dandy.

259
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:16,621
The masters at Leamy's
School all have straps and sticks.

260
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:19,707
They hit you if you don't know
that God made the world,

261
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,834
or if you don't know
the patron saint of Limerick.

262
00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:23,979
They hit you if you can't say
the Hail Maryin Irish...

263
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:26,130
or if you can't ask
for the lavatory pass in Irish.

264
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:29,717
They hit you if you laugh,
if you're late, if you talk.

265
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,112
One master will hit you if you
don't know that Eamon De Valera...

266
00:22:32,136 --> 00:22:34,347
was the greatest man that ever lived.

267
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,575
Another will hit you if you don't know
that Michael Collins...

268
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,601
was the greatest man that ever lived.

269
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:41,437
McCourt.

270
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:05,836
You're a bad Yank, McCourt. What are you?

271
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:10,216
They said we were cowboys
and gangsters, sir.

272
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:12,635
- I was only joking, sir.
- No more jokes.

273
00:23:12,718 --> 00:23:14,804
- It's not their fault they're Yanks.
- T'isn't, sir.

274
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:17,807
You should go down
on your two knees every night...

275
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,726
and give thanks to God
that you're not a Yank.

276
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,979
If you were, Al Capone himself would be
coming to you for instruction.

277
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,199
I know Oliver is dead.

278
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,618
Malachy knows Oliver is dead,

279
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:41,622
but little Eugene is only two
and too small to know anything.

280
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:43,624
Malachy and I make him laugh,

281
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:45,626
pull faces, put pots on our heads,

282
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:49,171
take him to the park,
show him the flowers.

283
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:54,135
Me dad says Eugene is lucky to have
such brothers like me and Malachy.

284
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,193
He died anyway.

285
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:13,195
Ma.

286
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:28,836
Please, God,

287
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,672
is this what you want, is it?

288
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:35,926
I'm not supposed to question this, am I?

289
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:42,766
You took my son, Oliver.

290
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:45,477
You took his brother, Eugene.

291
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:50,274
You took their beautiful
wee sister, Margaret Mary.

292
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:56,655
Dear God above,

293
00:24:56,739 --> 00:25:00,409
why do you want the wee children to die?

294
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:19,678
Please, God, don't let Malachy
and me and the rest of us...

295
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:23,849
be taken off in the box
for the hole in the ground.

296
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:27,519
Or even Aunt Aggie
or Mr. Benson at Leamy's School.

297
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:32,232
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Toast.

298
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,782
Be going in a minute, son.

299
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:24,243
No, that's Eugene's coffin.

300
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:26,745
I'll tell mam you put your pint
on Eugene's coffin.

301
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:30,040
- Have another pint, mister.
- Will you wait outside a few minutes?

302
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:32,251
- No!
- Jesus, if that was my son,

303
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:35,045
I'd kick his arse
from here to County Kerry.

304
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:39,299
I mean, if a man can't have a pint
on the day of a funeral,

305
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:41,343
what use is living at all?

306
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:24,470
I couldn't have spent
another minute in that room.

307
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:28,098
I saw me little twins
morning, noon and night.

308
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:31,101
If we hadn't have moved,
I'd have gone out of my mind...

309
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:33,687
and ended up in the lunatic asylum.

310
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:42,404
I'm sorry, but it was
only five months ago.

311
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:47,201
And before that,
I lost my little girl in New York.

312
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:50,954
And I've the two boys here
and I've one on the way.

313
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:53,165
Ah, now, missus, sit down, will you?

314
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,167
Thanks.

315
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,839
That's a nice coat you're wearing.

316
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:04,885
It was given to me
by my cousin in Brooklyn. It's not new.

317
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:08,972
McCourt. That's not a Limerick name.

318
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,099
Where'd you get a name like that?

319
00:28:11,183 --> 00:28:13,185
My husband, sir. He's from the North.

320
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:16,647
Why don't you go to Belfast and see
what they can do for you up there?

321
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,318
I don't know, sir.

322
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:23,320
Of course you don't know.

323
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:25,364
There's great ignorance in the world.

324
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:27,567
I said there's a great deal
of ignorance in the world.

325
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:34,331
And what do you want from us?

326
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:37,542
There isn't a stick of furniture
in the new place.

327
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:42,464
- Does your husband have a job?
- No, sir, he's on the dole.

328
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:49,554
We'll give you a docket
for a table, two chairs and two beds.

329
00:28:49,596 --> 00:28:52,599
You can take it to the second hand
furniture shop in Irish town.

330
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:55,686
Excuse me, sir,
but will the beds be second hand?

331
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:58,105
Of course they will.

332
00:28:58,188 --> 00:29:00,983
I'm worried about sleeping
in beds people might have died in.

333
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:03,068
Especially if they died
of the consumption.

334
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,155
Beggars can't be choosers, Mrs. McCourt.

335
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,953
Thanks.

336
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:08,884
I should say it's a good fire.

337
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:13,138
Could it be true

338
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:15,515
Hey, hey, that's my wife.

339
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:17,517
Someone like you

340
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,479
Who's he?

341
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,150
That, Francis, is Pope Leo XIII,

342
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:28,028
and he was a great friend
of the working man.

343
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:31,364
You know, I found this in an alley
in Brooklyn in someone's rubbish.

344
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:34,326
No doubt thrown away by some eejit
that had no time for the working man.

345
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:36,369
Ugh, what's that stink?

346
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:40,040
Hey, what are you doing?

347
00:30:40,123 --> 00:30:42,334
Why are you emptying your bucket
in our lavatory?

348
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:46,171
Your lavatory, mister? Ah, no.
I think you're mistaken there.

349
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:48,340
This here is the lavatory
for the whole lane, it is.

350
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:51,760
The buckets of 11 families
get flushed down here every day.

351
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:54,221
And it gets fairly powerful here
in the warm weather.

352
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:56,515
So powerful you'll be
calling for a gas mask.

353
00:30:56,556 --> 00:30:58,892
So, good night to you. Missus.

354
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:01,144
I hope you'll be happy in the house.

355
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:04,606
Thanks very much.

356
00:31:04,773 --> 00:31:08,735
And there was this big man,
and he came along and he met this woman,

357
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:11,947
and he grew a big huge beard
all over her face,

358
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,574
and then they got married.

359
00:31:33,301 --> 00:31:35,262
Have we moved again, Frankie?

360
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:37,764
No, they wouldn't go without the Pope.

361
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:59,119
Oh, Jesus, look at the state of youse.
Couple of drowning rats.

362
00:31:59,202 --> 00:32:01,097
Get your wet clothes off,
dry yourself by the fire,

363
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:04,457
and say hello to your brother Michael.

364
00:32:06,543 --> 00:32:08,461
He's fatter than the Baby Jesus.

365
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:11,965
He's the spitting image of your dead
little sister...

366
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:15,218
with the lovely blue eyes
and the gorgeous eyebrows.

367
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,220
Why are we all upstairs?

368
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:21,099
The downstairs is full of the damp.
It's killing us one by one.

369
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:24,269
That lavatory could kill us
with every class of disease.

370
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:26,896
It was the Limerick damp
that killed your wee brothers.

371
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,816
We'll be dry up here for now.
We'll go downstairs for the spring.

372
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:32,569
It's like going away on holiday
to a nice, warm, foreign place,

373
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:34,571
like-like Italy.

374
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:36,573
- Italy?
- Aye, we could be in Sorrento.

375
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:38,616
Calcutta, more like.

376
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,495
- What about the Pope?
- He can stay downstairs in Ireland.

377
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:46,416
Will you look at the state
of those children's shoes?

378
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,501
I can't go to the St. Vincent's for boots.

379
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:51,838
I'm too weak to be standing in the queue.

380
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:55,341
There was a woman who had triplets
waiting forever in that queue.

381
00:32:55,383 --> 00:32:58,511
Have you no pride, Angela,
begging like that?

382
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:01,347
What would you do, Mr. Grand Manner?

383
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:03,492
You'd let them go barefoot
before you got off your arse,

384
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:05,018
useless feck that you are.

385
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,107
Right.

386
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,151
Useless feck, is it?

387
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:15,153
We'll see.

388
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,718
It's poor I am.

389
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:44,724
It's unlucky I am.

390
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,524
But it's useless...

391
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:58,571
I'm not.

392
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,004
Look at those shoes!

393
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:56,421
- Where are your shoes?
- Don't know, sir.

394
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:59,173
Of course you know, boy. Where are they?

395
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:02,051
Did your mommy not put
on your shoes this morning?

396
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,721
Did you come to school
without shoes, did you?

397
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:08,349
How many times have you been told about
walking the streets in your bare feet?

398
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:11,728
By God, I'll boot
the bare feet out of you, boy.

399
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:22,071
Put them on, boy.

400
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:30,455
Quiet!

401
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:33,791
Do I hear sneering in this class?

402
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:37,128
Do I hear jeering at another's misfortune?

403
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:40,381
Is there any boy in this class
who thinks he's perfect?

404
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:43,551
If so, raise your hands.

405
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:47,305
Is there any boy here now who has money
galore to be spending on shoes?

406
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,807
Raise your hands.

407
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:52,435
No.

408
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:56,814
There are boys in this class
who have no shoes at all,

409
00:35:56,898 --> 00:36:00,485
and it's not their fault.

410
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:02,487
It's not their shame.

411
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,239
Our Lord had no shoes.

412
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:09,619
He died shoeless.

413
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:14,123
You don't see Him
hanging on the cross sporting shoes.

414
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:17,418
- Do you, boys?
- No, sir!

415
00:36:17,502 --> 00:36:19,420
What is it you don't see Our Lord doing?

416
00:36:19,504 --> 00:36:23,007
Hanging on the cross sporting shoes.

417
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,010
"Hanging on the cross
sporting shoes," what?

418
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:30,306
Hanging on the cross sporting shoes, sir.

419
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:36,103
Everyday, me dad would look for a job,

420
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:39,023
- somehow, he never seemed to get one.
- We've enough for today.

421
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:42,652
- Mam said it was his Northern accent.
- No work here. Sorry.

422
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:47,406
Grandma said it was because
of his funny manner.

423
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:04,006
Me dad knew those
lanes like the back of his hand.

424
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,884
He walked them often enough
when he couldn't get work...

425
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:09,762
and was too ashamed
to come home to me mam.

426
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:16,811
That's why we loved Easter.

427
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:20,856
Because it was at Easter
that me dad got his first job.

428
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:28,781
The dipsy doodle is the thing to beware

429
00:37:28,864 --> 00:37:31,617
The dipsy doodle is gonna get in your hair

430
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:34,412
And if it gets to you it couldn't be worse

431
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:37,248
The things you say
will all come out in reverse

432
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:39,750
Don't go up the mine, Manny

433
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:42,628
That's the way the dipsy doodle works

434
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:44,839
The dipsy doodle is a way to do fine

435
00:37:44,922 --> 00:37:48,259
It's almost always
at the back of your mind

436
00:37:48,342 --> 00:37:51,512
You never know it's there
until it's too late

437
00:37:51,596 --> 00:37:53,723
And then you get in such a terrible state

438
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:56,017
Will you stop it?

439
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,561
Maybe if you weren't
strangling me, I'd be fine.

440
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:02,189
- Stop it.
- When you think you're crazy

441
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:05,609
It was only
at the Limerick Cement Factory,

442
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:07,862
but he still wore a collar and tie.

443
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:11,490
He said a man without a tie
had no respect for himself.

444
00:38:22,376 --> 00:38:24,920
Come on.

445
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:41,270
In Mount joy jail

446
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:44,315
One Monday morning

447
00:38:44,357 --> 00:38:49,278
High upon the gallows tree

448
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:53,616
Kevin Barry gave his young life

449
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:57,453
For the cause of liberty

450
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,497
For Jesus' sake, put a sockin it!

451
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,041
Some of us have to go
to feckin' work in the morning!

452
00:39:02,124 --> 00:39:07,004
Yet there's no one can deny

453
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:10,800
As he walked to death that morning

454
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:14,178
He proudly held his head

455
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:20,976
His head up high

456
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:29,819
Francis! Malachy!

457
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:39,870
Come down here, boys.
I have the Friday penny for you.

458
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:42,832
No. Be quiet.

459
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:46,710
Up, boys!

460
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:50,714
Those Red Branch Knights!

461
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:53,133
Those Fenian men!

462
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:56,178
The glorious I.R.A.!

463
00:39:56,262 --> 00:40:00,057
Up! Up! Up!

464
00:40:21,328 --> 00:40:25,082
I have the Friday penny for you, boys.

465
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,209
You line up like soldiers now,

466
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:30,504
and promise to die for Ireland.

467
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:34,091
- I don't want it.
- I don't want it either.

468
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,599
Damn!

469
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:49,023
When we woke up the next morning,

470
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:51,025
he was still asleep.

471
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:53,444
He missed work and lost his job.

472
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:18,135
And what do I have here, Clohessy?

473
00:41:18,218 --> 00:41:20,804
Strips of newspaper, sir.

474
00:41:20,971 --> 00:41:23,557
And what do they represent, Clohessy?

475
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,684
Pieces of the Limerick Leader, sir.

476
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:28,103
No!

477
00:41:28,145 --> 00:41:31,106
The body and blood of Christ.

478
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:33,567
If you don't pay more attention,
it'll be the Last Rites...

479
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,861
you'll be getting,
not your Holy Communion.

480
00:41:38,405 --> 00:41:41,241
Irish is the language of patriots...

481
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:45,162
and English of traitors and informers.

482
00:41:45,204 --> 00:41:48,082
But Latin-ah, boys, Latin-

483
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:51,168
that the Holy Martyrs
spoke before expiring...

484
00:41:51,251 --> 00:41:54,046
in the foaming mouths of ravenous lions.

485
00:41:54,129 --> 00:41:58,550
Yes, it's Latin that gains
entrance to heaven itself.

486
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:00,511
But there are boys in this class...

487
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:04,515
who will never know Sanctifying Grace.

488
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:07,309
And why? Because of greed.

489
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:10,687
Those greedy little black guards
are talking even now...

490
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:14,316
about the money they'll
get from the Collection.

491
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:19,154
They'll go from house to house
in their little suits like beggars.

492
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:21,156
And will they take any of that money...

493
00:42:21,198 --> 00:42:26,120
and send it to the poor black babies
in Africa as they should?

494
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:28,330
Oh, no.

495
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:33,252
It's off to the cinema
the First Communion boys will go...

496
00:42:33,335 --> 00:42:38,173
to wallow in the disgusting filth...

497
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:43,178
spewed across the world
by the devil's henchmen...

498
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,056
in Hollywood.

499
00:42:46,098 --> 00:42:49,184
- Isn't that right, McCourt?
- 'Tis, sir.

500
00:42:49,226 --> 00:42:53,105
Don't speak, you! Can't you see
that God is on your tongue?

501
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:56,358
Where is God, boys?

502
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,236
On his tongue, sir.

503
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:01,238
On his tongue.

504
00:43:04,324 --> 00:43:06,869
My friend, Mikey Molloy,

505
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,912
tells us all about
how much money we'll make...

506
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:10,956
at the Collection
after our First Communion,

507
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:13,000
when we all knock
on the neighbors' doors...

508
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:16,253
and get as much as five shillings
for sweets and cakes...

509
00:43:16,336 --> 00:43:18,881
and even go to the Lyric Cinema
to see James Cagney.

510
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:22,301
- I seen it three times.
- What happens in it?

511
00:43:22,384 --> 00:43:26,221
Also, Mikey is the expert
in the lane on girls' bodies...

512
00:43:26,263 --> 00:43:28,473
and dirty things in general.

513
00:43:28,557 --> 00:43:31,351
Now, on top, the girls
have great floppy things called titties.

514
00:43:31,435 --> 00:43:34,897
And at the end of them,
great red things like dogs' noses.

515
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,859
And down at the bottom-
Now that's an entirely different matter.

516
00:43:38,942 --> 00:43:42,779
- They don't have a mickey down there.
- What do they have?

517
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:45,407
I can tell you, but I don't think
he should hear it.

518
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:47,409
Malachy, go away.

519
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:52,873
Eww! Yuck!

520
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:03,634
Oh, look, I'll take one of these as well.

521
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:36,208
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

522
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:39,586
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
This is my first confession.

523
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,423
Yes, my child.
And what sins have you committed?

524
00:44:43,507 --> 00:44:45,675
I told a lie, I hit my brother,

525
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:48,261
I stole a penny from my mother's purse,

526
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:50,305
and I ate a sausage on Friday.

527
00:44:50,347 --> 00:44:52,599
Yes, my child, anything else?

528
00:44:52,682 --> 00:44:55,602
I listened to dirty things
about girls from the lanes...

529
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:58,063
who don't care what they do because they-

530
00:44:58,146 --> 00:45:01,066
because they've already
done it with their brothers.

531
00:45:01,149 --> 00:45:04,820
And who told you these things?

532
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:07,531
- Mikey Molloy, Father.
- Hmm.

533
00:45:07,614 --> 00:45:11,034
For your penance, say three Hail Marys,
three Our Fathers,

534
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:13,370
and say a special prayer for me.

535
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:15,455
Am I one of the worst boys, Father?

536
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:18,500
No, mychild. You have a long way to go.

537
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,131
Wake up! Wake up!

538
00:45:24,214 --> 00:45:27,676
His First Communion,
the happiest day of his life,

539
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,719
and the lot of you still snoring in there.

540
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:33,223
Here, you two, get up. Go on.

541
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:35,934
Look at him.
A bar of soap wouldn't be lost on him.

542
00:45:36,017 --> 00:45:37,978
I'll be red raw.

543
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:40,397
I swear it's the Northern Ireland in you.

544
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,399
It attracts the dirt.

545
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,651
You've the dirty gob of your father.

546
00:45:44,734 --> 00:45:46,444
Aah! That's cold.

547
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:48,989
Jesus, you have enough dirt
in your ears...

548
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:51,741
to grow potatoes.

549
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:55,954
Will you look at that mop?
It won't lie down.

550
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:58,874
You didn't get this hair
from our side of the family.

551
00:45:58,915 --> 00:46:01,877
This is North of Ireland hair
you got from your father.

552
00:46:01,918 --> 00:46:05,422
It's like-like what
you'd see on a Presbyterian.

553
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:10,218
Will you stop spitting on me?

554
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,762
A little spit won't kill you.

555
00:46:12,846 --> 00:46:16,516
If your mother had married a proper,
decent Limerick man,

556
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,769
you wouldn't have stand-up,
North of Ireland, Protestant hair.

557
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:21,771
And we wouldn't be late.

558
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:42,250
Corpus Christi.

559
00:46:44,794 --> 00:46:47,422
Corpus Christi.

560
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,095
Corpus Christi.

561
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:02,312
Will you stop your clucking
and get back to your seat?

562
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:06,274
Corpus Christi.

563
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:17,285
Mam, can I go now and make the Collection?

564
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,121
I want to go to the Lyric
to see James Cagney.

565
00:47:20,163 --> 00:47:21,974
You can't make the Collection
until you've had...

566
00:47:21,998 --> 00:47:24,125
a proper First Communion breakfast
at my house.

567
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,752
Mam.

568
00:47:37,305 --> 00:47:39,766
Will you look at him?
The manners of a pig.

569
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:41,810
He eats like a Presbyterian.

570
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:45,814
Is it a millionaire you think I am?
An American?

571
00:47:45,855 --> 00:47:47,982
Is there any more tea in the pot, Mam?

572
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:50,610
- Aye.
- I could do with a cup.

573
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:53,530
You allright, Frankie?

574
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:57,200
- What's the matter, Frankie?
- What's wrong with that child?

575
00:48:00,328 --> 00:48:03,707
Look what he did! He's thrown up
the body and blood of Jesus.

576
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:07,669
What am I to do?
I have God in me backyard!

577
00:48:15,051 --> 00:48:16,970
I'm taking you to the priest.

578
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:19,722
That was a dreadful thing
you did in my backyard.

579
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,271
In the name of The Father
and of The Son and of the Holy Ghost.

580
00:48:26,354 --> 00:48:28,273
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

581
00:48:28,356 --> 00:48:30,275
It's been a day since my last confession.

582
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:32,277
A day?

583
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,946
And what sins have you committed
in a day, my son?

584
00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:38,116
I overslept, and I nearly missed
my First Communion.

585
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:40,410
My hair stuck up like a Protestant's,

586
00:48:40,493 --> 00:48:43,204
and I threw up my First
Holy Communion breakfast.

587
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:47,584
Now me grandma says she has God
in her backyard and what shall she do?

588
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:51,588
Tell your grandma to wash it away
with a little water.

589
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,093
Holy water or ordinary water?

590
00:48:57,135 --> 00:49:00,096
- He didn't say, Grandma.
- Well, go back and ask him.

591
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:10,273
In the name of The Father
and of The Son and of The Holy Ghost.

592
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:12,275
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

593
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:14,736
It's been a minute
since my last confession.

594
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:17,405
A minute? Are you the boy
that was just here?

595
00:49:17,447 --> 00:49:20,909
- I am, Father.
- What is it now?

596
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,871
My grandma says holy water
or ordinary water?

597
00:49:28,124 --> 00:49:31,294
He says ordinary water,
and don't go bothering him again.

598
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:33,171
Bothering him?

599
00:49:33,254 --> 00:49:36,216
Well, the ignorant old bog trotter.

600
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:42,055
There wasn't anytime
for the Collection. Not a penny.

601
00:49:42,138 --> 00:49:44,766
So Mikey Molloy pretended
to have one of his fits...

602
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:47,644
so that I could slip in
when no one was looking.

603
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,896
- Missus, quick, He's having a fit!
- Is he all right?

604
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:51,940
Mr. O'Brien, quick!

605
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:59,447
Watch he doesn't swallow his tongue.

606
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,826
Does anyone know what to do?

607
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:07,830
- No, don't. I'll do anything.
- Oh, no, you won't.

608
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:10,124
You've had your last chance.
You can take this with you.

609
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:13,044
Shoot him!

610
00:50:13,127 --> 00:50:15,838
All you had to do was bump me off.

611
00:50:20,468 --> 00:50:23,304
- Do you want a toffee?
- Thanks.

612
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:29,978
I'm glad I did the First Communion.

613
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:32,939
I'm glad I got my First Confession
over and done with.

614
00:50:33,022 --> 00:50:37,443
Now I'm free to grow up.
Old enough to be ten, anyway.

615
00:50:37,485 --> 00:50:40,822
Old enough to pay the ultimate penance
for growing up.

616
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:42,907
Worse than joining
the army or the police...

617
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:46,411
or going to Australia
or becoming a nun in Africa.

618
00:50:46,494 --> 00:50:49,872
Worse than that,
I had to learn Irish dancing.

619
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:54,168
I don't want to learn it.
Ow. What did you do that for?

620
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:56,462
Just don't want to learn how to dance.

621
00:50:56,504 --> 00:50:58,464
...and back and back.

622
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:05,805
Up and back and one, two.

623
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:08,599
Lift up your feet, for the love of Jesus.

624
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:12,145
One, two, three. And one, two, three.
And up and back, and one, two, three.

625
00:51:12,228 --> 00:51:14,272
And up and back, andone, two, three.

626
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:16,524
If my mates saw me
making a pure eejit out of meself...

627
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,318
at the Irish dancing,
I'd be disgraced forever.

628
00:51:19,402 --> 00:51:21,696
I want to be Fred Astaire.

629
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,341
Irish dancers look like they have
steel rods stuck up their arses.

630
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:26,659
Would you stop the frowning
Frankie McCourt?

631
00:51:26,742 --> 00:51:28,870
You've a face on you
like a pound of tripe.

632
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:33,040
And up and back, and one, two, three.
And up and back, and one, two, three.

633
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:39,839
The next time I went to dancing lessons,
I bumped into Paddy Clohessy.

634
00:51:39,922 --> 00:51:41,883
- Hi, Frankie.
- Hiya, Paddy. How you doing?

635
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:45,052
- Not too bad. You?
- Grand. Catch.

636
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:48,264
Frankie, I'm telling you,
that dancing stuff is for sissies.

637
00:51:48,347 --> 00:51:50,308
You won't be able to play football next.

638
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:52,685
- I won't?
- You'll be running around girlie-like.

639
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:55,438
- Shut up.
- Everyone will be laughing at you.

640
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:59,567
- They will?
- Next thing, you'll be knitting socks.

641
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:10,369
I was finished with the dancing.

642
00:52:10,453 --> 00:52:14,499
Every Saturday, my mam's sixpence
got me and Paddy into the Lyric...

643
00:52:14,582 --> 00:52:18,294
with enough left to stuff our gobs
with Cleeves' toffee.

644
00:52:26,427 --> 00:52:28,596
Yay!

645
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:32,266
I was so happy, I didn't know whether
to shit or go blind.

646
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,898
Every week, I'd take the money
and skip the dancing...

647
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,900
and go to the pictures.

648
00:52:40,942 --> 00:52:43,402
When I got home,
I'd make up the dancing...

649
00:52:43,444 --> 00:52:46,113
- and pretend I had a poker up my arse.
- Well done, son.

650
00:52:47,782 --> 00:52:50,576
Hitler shows himself in his true colors.

651
00:52:50,618 --> 00:52:53,037
He marches his troops
into the Rhineland...

652
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,915
in defiance of the terms
of the Treaty of Versailles.

653
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,420
The swastika spreads its evil shadow.

654
00:53:03,506 --> 00:53:08,094
Sir, what use is Euclid when the Germans
are bombing everything in sight?

655
00:53:08,135 --> 00:53:10,638
What use is Euclid?

656
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,848
Without Euclid,

657
00:53:12,932 --> 00:53:16,060
the Messerschmitt could never
have taken to the sky...

658
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:18,396
and dart from cloud to cloud...

659
00:53:18,479 --> 00:53:21,357
and bomb the be jesus out of the English,

660
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,819
who deserve it after what they
did to the Irish for 800 years.

661
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:28,739
Euclid is grace and beauty...

662
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:30,783
and elegance.

663
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:33,995
- Do you understand that, boys?
- We do, sir.

664
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:37,456
- We do, sir.
- I doubt it.

665
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,794
To love Euclid is to be alone
in this world.

666
00:53:41,877 --> 00:53:45,339
You. Clohessy.

667
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:48,217
Who stood at the foot of the cross
when our Lord was crucified?

668
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:51,846
The Twelve Apostles, sir?

669
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:55,141
Clohessy, what is the Irish word for fool?

670
00:53:55,224 --> 00:53:56,976
Omadhaun, sir.

671
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:01,021
Sir. I know who stood
at the foot of the cross, sir.

672
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:03,023
It was the three Marys, sir.

673
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,943
That's Fintan Slattery.

674
00:54:06,026 --> 00:54:08,821
He's going to be a saint
when he gets older.

675
00:54:08,904 --> 00:54:11,490
Everyone know she wears
his sister's blouse at night...

676
00:54:11,574 --> 00:54:13,659
and curls his hair with hot iron tongs...

677
00:54:13,743 --> 00:54:17,037
so that he'll look gorgeous
at Mass on Sundays.

678
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:19,290
It's no wonder we played truant.

679
00:54:19,373 --> 00:54:21,167
Chickens!

680
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,335
Of all the girls I've known
and I've known some

681
00:54:23,419 --> 00:54:26,130
Untill first met you I was lonesome

682
00:54:26,213 --> 00:54:29,383
And when you came in sight
my heart grew light

683
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:32,470
And this old world seemed new to me

684
00:54:32,553 --> 00:54:34,889
You're really swell I have to admit you

685
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:37,141
Deserve expressions that really fit you

686
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:40,019
Hurry up, Frankie. I can't hold them.

687
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:44,356
I've racked my brain hoping to explain
all the things that you do to me

688
00:54:44,398 --> 00:54:50,821
Bei mir bist du schon
please let me explain

689
00:54:50,905 --> 00:54:53,157
Frankie, there's nothing in the world...

690
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,035
like a good feed of apples
and a drink of water...

691
00:54:56,118 --> 00:55:00,331
and a good shit and plenty of grass
to wipe your arse with.

692
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,877
Paddy, quick, wipe your arse.
It's milking time!

693
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,630
Will you wait for me? Frankie, wait.

694
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:12,218
Frankie, you're doing it wrong.
You've got to pull it down.

695
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:14,929
- You have to squeeze down.
- Shut up!

696
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,598
- Shut up!
- Frankie, don't!

697
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:21,393
- Hey, clear off, you little bastards!
- Run, Paddy, run!

698
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:24,730
I'll give you such a kick in the hole,
you won't know what hit you.

699
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:27,483
Here, piggy.

700
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:30,444
Mikey Molloy persuaded
us to go to Peter Dooley's house.

701
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:33,405
Peter Dooley has a hump like
the one Charles Laughton had...

702
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:35,908
in The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

703
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,451
That's why they call him Quasimodo.

704
00:55:37,493 --> 00:55:42,414
Oh, and he has these four sisters
with the enormous breasts.

705
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,669
Okay, it's a shilling
for the three of you.

706
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:49,922
Climb up the spout, and each of youse
have a look, but no wankin'.

707
00:55:49,964 --> 00:55:52,591
I've my own sisters. Why should I pay
to see your naked sisters?

708
00:55:52,675 --> 00:55:56,512
'Cause looking at your own naked sisters
is the worst sin ofall.

709
00:55:56,595 --> 00:55:59,932
Not even a bishop in the world could
forgive you for it.

710
00:56:00,015 --> 00:56:01,976
What canyousee?

711
00:56:02,017 --> 00:56:04,728
- Oh, it's grand.
- Can you see their tits?

712
00:56:07,147 --> 00:56:10,276
I said no wankin'.
There's to be no wankin' up the spout.

713
00:56:10,317 --> 00:56:12,945
- Oh, it's grand.
- I said no wankin' up the spout!

714
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:22,121
- You perverted bunch of filth!
- Let go!

715
00:56:22,162 --> 00:56:25,791
My daughters can't even wash
themselves on a Friday night!

716
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:29,086
Poor Quasimodo. He was right.

717
00:56:29,169 --> 00:56:32,923
Gawking at your own naked sisters
is the worst sin of all.

718
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:35,384
Except when you charge
a shilling for the pleasure.

719
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:37,511
That's worse still.

720
00:56:37,678 --> 00:56:41,557
Introibo adaltare Dei. And then you say?

721
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,977
Ad Deum quila etificat juventutem meam.

722
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:49,023
Right. Introibo adaltare Dei,
and then you say?

723
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:52,484
Ad Deum quila etificat juventutem meam.

724
00:56:52,526 --> 00:56:54,486
Very good. Again. Introibo ad-

725
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:58,323
Ad Deum quila etificat juventutem mean.

726
00:56:58,365 --> 00:57:02,870
Hello. How are you?
This is my son, Francis.

727
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:07,332
He can recite the Latin,
and he's ready to be an altarboy.

728
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:09,918
- Ad Deum-
- I'm sorry. We have no room.

729
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,931
Never mind, son.

730
00:57:26,685 --> 00:57:30,022
Sacred Stan
said there was no room for him.

731
00:57:41,784 --> 00:57:45,078
I'll tell you what it is.

732
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:48,040
'Tis class distinction.

733
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:53,253
They don't want the boys
from the lanes at the altar.

734
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:55,589
They don't want the ones
with the scabby knees...

735
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,425
and their arses hanging
out of their trousers.

736
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:03,013
They want the boys with the nice shoes
and the clean hair...

737
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:05,682
and the fathers with the steady jobs.

738
00:58:05,766 --> 00:58:07,768
Not useless like you.

739
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:13,899
That's what it is.

740
00:58:13,982 --> 00:58:17,194
And it's hard to hang on to your faith.

741
00:58:38,507 --> 00:58:42,177
You buy pints for people you don't know
who tell you you're a grand man,

742
00:58:42,261 --> 00:58:45,597
while your children are at home with
their bellies stuck to their backbones.

743
00:58:48,308 --> 00:58:51,228
Aye, you're right.

744
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:53,480
I'll get a job. I promise.

745
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:55,691
If you get a job,
you lose it the third week...

746
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,693
because you drink all the wages...

747
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:01,029
and you miss the work.

748
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:03,573
We'll get by, Angela.

749
00:59:03,615 --> 00:59:05,617
I'll change.

750
00:59:08,287 --> 00:59:10,914
The dole is 19 shillings
and the rent is 6.

751
00:59:10,998 --> 00:59:15,544
And that leaves 13 shillings
to feed and clothe 5 people.

752
00:59:18,005 --> 00:59:20,590
God is good, you know.

753
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:25,554
God might be good for someone somewhere,

754
00:59:25,637 --> 00:59:28,015
but he hasn't been seen lately
in the lanes of Limerick.

755
00:59:30,058 --> 00:59:31,977
Oh, Angela.

756
00:59:34,563 --> 00:59:37,065
You could go to hell for saying that.

757
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:43,864
Aren't I there already, Malachy?

758
00:59:50,495 --> 00:59:52,748
Come here. Come here.

759
01:00:09,056 --> 01:00:13,602
And then the angels
left another baby on the stairs again.

760
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:17,647
What are you going to call him, Angela?

761
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:20,108
I like the name Kevin or Sean.

762
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,487
If you called out the door,
"Kevin, Sean, come in for your tea,"

763
01:00:23,528 --> 01:00:26,782
you'd have half of Limerick
running at you.

764
01:00:26,865 --> 01:00:30,118
- I like the name Alphonsus.
- Alphonsus?

765
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,287
That's a stupid name.

766
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:34,289
Ah, Jesus Christ!

767
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:38,877
- Don't curse!
- Will you leave the poor child alone?

768
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,713
I wondered how many more babies...

769
01:00:41,797 --> 01:00:43,715
the angels would leave on the stairs.

770
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:45,967
Someone else to share my dinner with.

771
01:00:46,051 --> 01:00:48,011
Ow. What did you do that for?

772
01:00:48,053 --> 01:00:50,347
Don't laugh.
Now you know what it feels like.

773
01:00:51,765 --> 01:00:54,351
At least my grandpa in the North...

774
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:57,312
sent us five pounds for the baby Alphie.

775
01:00:57,354 --> 01:01:01,316
All right. You go home and tell your
mother I'll be back in a few minutes.

776
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:03,318
You're not to go to the pub, Da.

777
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,320
Mom said you're to bring home the money.

778
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:08,824
- You're not to drink the pint.
- Now listen.

779
01:01:08,907 --> 01:01:11,743
- You go home to your mother now.
- Da.

780
01:01:11,827 --> 01:01:14,371
Give us the money.
That money is for the new baby.

781
01:01:14,454 --> 01:01:16,414
Da!

782
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:18,416
Please, Da.

783
01:01:22,587 --> 01:01:24,548
Go home!

784
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:38,562
Will you come in here, Frankie?

785
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,025
I want you to go down to South's Pub,

786
01:01:44,109 --> 01:01:46,653
and I want you to stand
in the middle of the pub...

787
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:51,575
and tell every man that your father
is drinking the money for the baby.

788
01:01:51,658 --> 01:01:54,053
You're to tell the world there's not
a scrap of food in the house.

789
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:56,538
There's not a lump of coal for the fire.

790
01:01:56,621 --> 01:02:00,292
There's not even a drop of milk
for the baby's bottle.

791
01:02:05,714 --> 01:02:07,716
Oh, come on.

792
01:02:22,981 --> 01:02:28,778
And I pray that the world
would in peace let me be

793
01:02:28,862 --> 01:02:32,449
And the green glens of Antrim

794
01:02:32,532 --> 01:02:36,328
Are welcoming me

795
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:39,205
And if you only knew

796
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,416
How the light of the moon

797
01:02:41,499 --> 01:02:45,253
My heart is banging
away, and all I can think of doing...

798
01:02:45,337 --> 01:02:48,298
is giving him a good kick
in the leg and running away.

799
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:51,301
- You'd imagine a picture
- But I don't.

800
01:02:51,384 --> 01:02:54,679
Because I remember all the nice times
he sat me by the fire...

801
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:59,142
and told me his stories of Cuchulain,
Roosevelt and De Valera.

802
01:03:02,604 --> 01:03:06,608
Later, he'll be home singing and
offering us a penny to die for Ireland.

803
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:09,277
It'll be different now.

804
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:12,322
Because it's bad enough
to drink the dole or the wages,

805
01:03:12,405 --> 01:03:16,910
but a man who drinks the money for
a new baby has gone beyond the beyonds.

806
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:35,178
Mam.

807
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:40,100
I couldn't find him.

808
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:42,811
Go to bed, Frankie.

809
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:57,158
With Confirmation,

810
01:03:57,242 --> 01:03:59,994
you will become
true soldiers of the Church.

811
01:04:00,078 --> 01:04:04,833
That entitles you to die a martyr...

812
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:07,752
in the event we're invaded
by Protestants...

813
01:04:07,836 --> 01:04:12,173
or Mohammedans
or any other class of heathen.

814
01:04:12,257 --> 01:04:14,175
You will have the gifts...

815
01:04:14,259 --> 01:04:17,136
of the Holy Ghost. Wisdom...

816
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,974
understanding, counsel.

817
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,351
What is the Third Station
of the Cross, my child?

818
01:04:23,434 --> 01:04:25,436
When Jesus falls for the first time.

819
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:32,986
What is the Fourth Commandment, my child?

820
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:35,947
Honor thy father and thy mother.

821
01:04:39,284 --> 01:04:42,579
Are you allright, Frankie?

822
01:05:06,853 --> 01:05:10,023
Father Gorey
is touching me with oil and praying,

823
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,317
and that means I'm going to die.

824
01:05:14,193 --> 01:05:16,112
But I don't care.

825
01:05:22,535 --> 01:05:26,039
And then Dr. Campbell
came in and held my hand.

826
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:29,000
It was then that I knew
I was going to get better.

827
01:05:32,378 --> 01:05:34,964
Because a doctor would never fart...

828
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:37,967
in the presence of a dying boy.

829
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:49,645
They gave me a whole new body
full of blood.

830
01:05:49,729 --> 01:05:53,691
Sister Rita said it came from
a soldier at Sarsfield Barracks.

831
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:11,876
Oh, son.

832
01:06:11,918 --> 01:06:14,379
You're a grand old soldier.

833
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:17,423
What's wrong with me?

834
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,469
You've had the typhoid.

835
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:29,268
Don't go.

836
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:33,731
Hey, you're a big boy now.

837
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:37,902
And don't forget you got
soldier's blood in you.

838
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:42,490
You're over the worst of it.

839
01:06:42,573 --> 01:06:46,536
Soon be home to Sorrento.

840
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:03,928
That was the first
time my dad ever kissed me.

841
01:07:04,011 --> 01:07:08,224
I felt so happy I could have floated
out of the bed.

842
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:26,617
Everyday, I couldn't wait
for the doctors and nurses...

843
01:07:26,659 --> 01:07:28,870
to leave me alone so that
Icould read my books.

844
01:07:28,953 --> 01:07:30,913
I loved having a lavatory of my own...

845
01:07:30,997 --> 01:07:33,958
where I could read for hours and hours.

846
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,004
"To die, to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dream.

847
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:40,089
Aye, there's the rub."

848
01:07:40,172 --> 01:07:42,133
Frankie, are you dead?

849
01:07:42,174 --> 01:07:44,594
Isn't it grand, Seamus? It's Shakespeare.

850
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:46,679
I loved the Shakespeare.

851
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:49,849
It was like having jewels in your mouth
when you said the words.

852
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:53,144
"I do believe, induced
by potent circumstances,

853
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:55,146
that thou art mine enemy."

854
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:58,566
"I do believe, induced
by potent circumstances,

855
01:07:58,649 --> 01:08:00,985
that thou art mine enemy."

856
01:08:01,027 --> 01:08:04,614
"I do believe, induced
by potent circumstances,

857
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:07,199
that thou art mine enemy."

858
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,619
- Bye! Bye!
- There's Frankie.

859
01:08:09,702 --> 01:08:12,663
But I missed me mom and dad and Malachy...

860
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:15,625
and little Michael
and the baby Alphie-God knows why.

861
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:18,502
- Frankie, will you hurry up now?
- Bye.

862
01:08:18,544 --> 01:08:22,089
It was a happy day
when I finally went home.

863
01:08:25,843 --> 01:08:28,929
- Hello, Frankie.
- Welcome home, Frankie.

864
01:08:29,013 --> 01:08:30,931
You're a grand soldier, Frankie.

865
01:08:31,015 --> 01:08:33,517
A credit to your mother and father.

866
01:08:33,601 --> 01:08:35,561
Welcome home, Frankie.

867
01:08:37,188 --> 01:08:40,566
Hello, Frankie.

868
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:44,904
It's grand to have you home, soldier.

869
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:47,281
Thank you, Mrs. Purcell.

870
01:08:47,365 --> 01:08:49,325
Goodman, Frankie.

871
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,333
Ah, Francis, my boy.

872
01:08:57,416 --> 01:09:00,252
But the moment
I saw me dad with Alphie on his lap...

873
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,338
was an empty feeling in my heart,

874
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:04,840
because I know he's out of work again.

875
01:09:04,924 --> 01:09:07,385
- Welcome home, son.
- Da.

876
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,639
It's good to see you.

877
01:09:11,722 --> 01:09:14,141
You too.

878
01:09:14,225 --> 01:09:16,310
Get a wee sit, right?

879
01:09:16,394 --> 01:09:19,647
St. Wilgefortis' mom had nine children.

880
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:23,692
But still, I loved
having my dad to myself in the morning.

881
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:27,321
I loved his stories where motorcars
and planes went under water.

882
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,990
Submarines flew up in the air,

883
01:09:30,074 --> 01:09:32,910
and polar bears wrestled
with elephants on the moon.

884
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:36,330
He was the Holy Trinity, wasmy dad,
with three people in him.

885
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:40,709
The one in the morning with his tea
and Woodbines telling us the stories.

886
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:44,713
The one who tried so hard
to find work but never did.

887
01:09:51,804 --> 01:09:56,308
And the one who came home at night
with the smell of whiskey on him.

888
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,872
But he was reading all the time
he was at the hospital.

889
01:10:17,955 --> 01:10:21,542
I'm sorry, Mrs. McCourt.
He's missed over two months of school.

890
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:26,046
He'll have to go back to the fifth
class. I'm really very sorry.

891
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,364
Mom, I don't want to go back
to fifth class.

892
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:55,284
Malachy's in fifth class,
and I'm a year older than him.

893
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:57,328
Oh, come on, Frankie.

894
01:10:57,411 --> 01:11:00,372
But all me friends will laugh at me
because I've been put back.

895
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:02,374
No.

896
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,675
What I needed was a miracle,

897
01:11:11,759 --> 01:11:16,472
and it happened right there outside
the Our Lady Of Liberty Pub.

898
01:11:16,513 --> 01:11:19,183
I looked up at her. She smiled.

899
01:11:19,266 --> 01:11:21,268
And when I looked down, there was a penny.

900
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:40,037
I spent the penny on a candle...

901
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:44,958
and prayed to St. Francis for him to
get me out of my little brother's class.

902
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,336
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name-

903
01:11:47,544 --> 01:11:51,924
Take that sour look off your puss,
Francis McCourt,

904
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,134
or you will feel the end of my stick.

905
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,470
Francis McCourt is going to show you...

906
01:11:56,512 --> 01:12:00,849
how well he learned
to write in this class last year.

907
01:12:00,933 --> 01:12:04,144
He's going to write a composition
on our Lord.

908
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,689
Aren't you, McCourt?

909
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:11,568
He's to tell us what it would be like
if our Lord had grown up in Limerick,

910
01:12:11,652 --> 01:12:13,612
the holiest city in Ireland.

911
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:17,825
Wilgefortis' dad wanted to marry her
off to the King of Sicily,

912
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:20,160
but the beautiful, young Wilgefortis...

913
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:23,122
was desperate not to marry
the scabby old man.

914
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,124
Oh.

915
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,501
And McCourt scores a brilliant goal.

916
01:12:33,006 --> 01:12:37,302
They said that Limerick
was the holiest city,

917
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:40,556
but everyone knewthe reason why there
were always people in the churches.

918
01:12:40,639 --> 01:12:42,933
It was because it was always raining,

919
01:12:43,016 --> 01:12:45,018
and they were in there
to get out of the wet.

920
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,104
The name of my composition is-

921
01:12:47,187 --> 01:12:51,066
Title, McCourt. The title.

922
01:12:51,108 --> 01:12:54,403
The title of my composition
is "Jesus and the Weather."

923
01:12:54,486 --> 01:12:56,864
What?

924
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:59,408
"Jesus and the Weather," sir.

925
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:01,910
All right, read it.

926
01:13:01,952 --> 01:13:04,121
"I don't think Jesus, who is our Lord,

927
01:13:04,204 --> 01:13:06,373
would have liked the weather in Limerick,

928
01:13:06,457 --> 01:13:10,752
because it's always raining and
the Shannon keeps the whole city damp.

929
01:13:10,794 --> 01:13:13,714
My father says the Shannon
is a killer river...

930
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:15,716
because it killed my two brothers.

931
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:17,718
When you look at pictures of Jesus,

932
01:13:17,759 --> 01:13:21,847
He's always wandering around
ancient Israel in a sheet.

933
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:25,267
It never rains there, and you never hear
of anyone coughing...

934
01:13:25,309 --> 01:13:28,145
or getting the consumption
or anything like that.

935
01:13:28,228 --> 01:13:31,899
And no one has a job there,
because all they do is stand around,

936
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:36,862
eat manna, shake their fists,
and go to crucifixions.

937
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:40,657
Any time Jesus got hungry, all He had
to do was to walk up the road...

938
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:43,952
to a fig tree oran orange tree
and have His fill.

939
01:13:43,994 --> 01:13:46,997
Or if He wanted a pint, He could
wave Hish and over a big glass...

940
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,999
and there was the pint.

941
01:13:49,082 --> 01:13:52,586
Or He could visit Mary Magdalene
and her sister Martha,

942
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:55,380
and they'd give Him His dinner,
no questions asked.

943
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:59,760
So it's a good thing Jesus decided to
be born Jewish in that nice warm place.

944
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:02,638
Because if He was born in Limerick,
He'd catch the consumption...

945
01:14:02,679 --> 01:14:06,099
and be dead in a month, and there
wouldn't be any Catholic Church,

946
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,393
and we wouldn't have to write
compositions about Him.

947
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:10,395
The end."

948
01:14:12,856 --> 01:14:15,150
Did you write this composition, McCourt?

949
01:14:15,192 --> 01:14:18,028
I did, sir.

950
01:14:19,863 --> 01:14:21,823
The miracle worked.

951
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:24,326
I was back in my old class.

952
01:14:24,368 --> 01:14:26,328
Stock your mind.

953
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,330
It's your house of treasure,

954
01:14:28,372 --> 01:14:31,667
and no one in the world
can interfere with it.

955
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:36,630
Fill your mind with rubbish,
and it'll rot your head.

956
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:40,467
You might be poor,
your shoes might be broken,

957
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,469
but your mind-

958
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:46,974
your mind is a palace.

959
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:50,644
And McCourt gets the ball,
he goes round one man...

960
01:14:50,727 --> 01:14:52,604
he goes up to the second man-

961
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,815
Peggy! Sean!

962
01:14:54,898 --> 01:14:57,776
Kathleen, come in for your tea.

963
01:14:57,859 --> 01:14:59,778
Come in for the lovely leg of lamb...

964
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:04,032
and the gorgeous green peas,
and the floury white potatoes.

965
01:15:04,074 --> 01:15:06,827
Oh, shut up, will you, woman?

966
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:09,079
It's a low-class mind
to torment your neighbors...

967
01:15:09,162 --> 01:15:11,081
when there's nothing
but bread and tea we have.

968
01:15:11,164 --> 01:15:13,458
Get off to work in England
like the rest of our husbands.

969
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,460
Go and help England win a war?

970
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:17,504
I wouldn't give the English
the steam off my pish.

971
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:19,631
No, you'd rather drink the dole...

972
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:22,092
and watch your sons
run around all skin and bone...

973
01:15:22,175 --> 01:15:24,428
with their arse hanging out
of their trousers.

974
01:15:24,511 --> 01:15:26,847
Kathleen, come in for your tea.

975
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:29,015
If I could work,
I'd be in the English factories.

976
01:15:29,099 --> 01:15:31,643
A factory's no place for a woman.

977
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:34,730
Sitting on your arse
is no place for a man.

978
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:39,109
And the game restarts in the second half.

979
01:15:39,151 --> 01:15:41,361
He's got the ball. He's going on the run.

980
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:43,363
Oh, you got the ball off him.

981
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:55,959
Get off me, will you?

982
01:15:56,001 --> 01:16:00,422
I'm worn out.

983
01:16:00,464 --> 01:16:03,258
That's the end of it for me.
No more children.

984
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,971
A good Catholic woman should perform
her wifely duties.

985
01:16:08,054 --> 01:16:09,973
Oh, feck off, will you?

986
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:18,231
You'll face eternal damnation, Angela.

987
01:16:18,315 --> 01:16:20,233
Well, as long as there
are no more children,

988
01:16:20,317 --> 01:16:23,737
eternal damnation sounds just fine
to me, Malachy.

989
01:16:47,594 --> 01:16:50,013
Come on, lads, come on.
You'll miss the train.

990
01:16:50,096 --> 01:16:52,015
You'll miss a good job. Come on.

991
01:16:52,098 --> 01:16:54,938
We've got the Guinness, and we've
got the Jameson in England, all right?

992
01:17:10,367 --> 01:17:13,119
Right. Uh-

993
01:17:13,203 --> 01:17:15,163
Remember your religious duties.

994
01:17:17,374 --> 01:17:20,543
And above all, you obey
your mother, right?

995
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:26,258
You're the man of the house now, Francis.

996
01:17:28,385 --> 01:17:30,679
Mind yourself.

997
01:17:42,232 --> 01:17:44,442
Come on. Let's go.

998
01:17:59,582 --> 01:18:02,836
Mam said all
we had to do was wait two weeks...

999
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:04,838
for the telegram with the money order.

1000
01:18:04,921 --> 01:18:07,757
Soon we'd have enough money
for new boots and coats,

1001
01:18:07,841 --> 01:18:10,051
ham, cabbage and potatoes for dinner,

1002
01:18:10,093 --> 01:18:13,555
electric light and maybe even a lavatory
like they have in America.

1003
01:18:13,596 --> 01:18:15,557
Now that Dad is gone to England,

1004
01:18:15,598 --> 01:18:18,059
sure I your troubles would be over.

1005
01:18:18,143 --> 01:18:20,061
Surely.

1006
01:18:33,116 --> 01:18:36,202
- Hello. Thank you very much.
- Hi.

1007
01:18:36,286 --> 01:18:39,080
- Thank you.
- There he is!

1008
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:44,627
Hey, wait! Has ours come? McCourt?

1009
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:47,422
- No.
- Are you sure? It's our first telegram.

1010
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:50,842
It should be for about three pounds
or maybe more.

1011
01:18:50,925 --> 01:18:53,219
- Sorry.
- Can you look in your pouch again?

1012
01:18:53,303 --> 01:18:56,139
I feckin' did already.
I've nothing for you.

1013
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:34,594
- Who's a good boy?
- Alphie!

1014
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:40,725
Begging for leftovers
is worse than the dole.

1015
01:19:40,808 --> 01:19:45,104
Worse than the St. Vincent
de Paul Charity. My own mother begging.

1016
01:19:45,188 --> 01:19:48,107
This is the worst kind of shame-

1017
01:19:48,191 --> 01:19:50,485
begging for the leftovers
from the priests' dinner.

1018
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:54,447
Like tinkers holding up
their scabby children on street corners.

1019
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:58,159
Worse than borrowing
from the money lender, Mrs. Finucane.

1020
01:20:16,636 --> 01:20:18,638
There was only one thing for it.

1021
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:21,474
I had to get a job.

1022
01:20:27,021 --> 01:20:29,732
This is the best morning of all, Frankie,

1023
01:20:29,816 --> 01:20:32,193
Saturday half day.

1024
01:20:32,235 --> 01:20:36,197
We start at 8:00 and finish
by the time the Angelus rings at 12:00.

1025
01:20:55,883 --> 01:20:58,594
The dipsy doodle is the thing to beware

1026
01:20:58,678 --> 01:21:01,639
The dipsy doodle is gonna get in your hair

1027
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:03,850
And if it gets you it couldn't be worse

1028
01:21:03,933 --> 01:21:06,853
The things you say will
all come out in reverse

1029
01:21:06,936 --> 01:21:09,439
Don't go up the mine, Manny

1030
01:21:09,522 --> 01:21:12,817
That's the way the dipsy doodle works

1031
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,069
The dipsy doodle isso easy to find

1032
01:21:15,153 --> 01:21:18,322
It's almost always
at the back of your mind

1033
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:21,409
You never know it's there
until it's too late

1034
01:21:21,492 --> 01:21:23,703
And then you get in such a terrible state

1035
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:26,372
The moon jumped over the cow, hey diddle

1036
01:21:26,456 --> 01:21:28,708
That's the way the dipsy doodle works

1037
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:56,027
The man who delivered 16 hundred weight
of coal deserves a pint.

1038
01:21:56,110 --> 01:21:58,404
And the boy who helped him
deserves a lemonade.

1039
01:21:59,989 --> 01:22:03,534
Your eyes look atrocious-
like two piss-holes in the snow.

1040
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:08,456
- It's the coal dust, Uncle Pa.
- You're a great man, Frank.

1041
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:11,125
You can help me
every Thursday after school.

1042
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:13,294
There's a shilling foryou.

1043
01:22:13,377 --> 01:22:15,505
More power to your elbow, Frankie.

1044
01:22:15,546 --> 01:22:18,591
He'll be taking yourjob yet,
you know, John.

1045
01:22:22,887 --> 01:22:26,098
He called me Frank, not Frankie.

1046
01:22:26,182 --> 01:22:28,643
For the first time, I feel like a man.

1047
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:30,686
A man with a shilling in his pocket.

1048
01:22:30,728 --> 01:22:32,980
A man who had a drink in a pub.

1049
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:45,076
Ma, I earned a shilling.

1050
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:48,621
Take tuppence, Frankie,
and take Malachy to the Lyric.

1051
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:52,041
You're a treasure, Frankie.
You deserve it.

1052
01:22:52,124 --> 01:22:55,086
God above, look at those eyes.

1053
01:23:16,607 --> 01:23:18,234
Frankie!

1054
01:23:20,945 --> 01:23:22,905
Frankie!

1055
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:28,744
A shilling from Mr. Hannon,
and four shillings in tips.

1056
01:23:30,871 --> 01:23:33,791
Will you go to that mirror
and look at your eyes?

1057
01:23:39,755 --> 01:23:42,091
Oh, jeez.

1058
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:44,218
That's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon.

1059
01:23:44,302 --> 01:23:46,220
Mr. Hannon needs me.

1060
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,681
I'm sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles,

1061
01:23:48,764 --> 01:23:51,309
but we have troubles of our own.

1062
01:23:51,392 --> 01:23:54,353
And the last thing I need is a blind son.

1063
01:23:54,437 --> 01:23:57,106
Now, wash your eyes,
and you can go to the Lyric.

1064
01:24:03,904 --> 01:24:06,741
Malachy, what's happening?

1065
01:24:06,824 --> 01:24:10,578
The man in the hat is sticking a gold
dagger into the nice lady's belly.

1066
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:13,664
- Is there blood all over?
- No. She's showing a magic ring.

1067
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:15,958
I can't see a thing.

1068
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,134
The doctor said...

1069
01:24:25,217 --> 01:24:27,154
this was the worst case of
conjunctivit is he'd ever seen.

1070
01:24:27,178 --> 01:24:29,472
How long will he be in, Doctor?

1071
01:24:29,513 --> 01:24:31,474
Only God knows that, woman.

1072
01:24:31,515 --> 01:24:33,476
I should have seen this child months ago.

1073
01:24:33,517 --> 01:24:35,352
My working days were over.

1074
01:24:35,436 --> 01:24:40,107
Eyes wide open. Wider. Wide as you can.

1075
01:24:40,191 --> 01:24:43,986
- Ow, Ma!
- If only dad was here.

1076
01:25:42,545 --> 01:25:46,006
He's not coming, Mam.

1077
01:25:46,048 --> 01:25:48,008
He might be asleep
in one of the carriages.

1078
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:51,178
Come on, Mam. Let's go home.
He's not coming.

1079
01:25:56,976 --> 01:26:00,771
He definitely said in his letter
two days before Christmas.

1080
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:02,773
Maybe the boat from Holyhead was late.

1081
01:26:02,856 --> 01:26:04,775
That could make you miss your train.

1082
01:26:04,858 --> 01:26:06,777
The Irish Sea's desperate
this time of year.

1083
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:09,780
He doesn't care about us.
He's over there drunk in England.

1084
01:26:09,863 --> 01:26:11,782
Don't talk about your father like that.

1085
01:26:14,493 --> 01:26:17,580
- Boots!
- Me! Me!

1086
01:26:17,663 --> 01:26:19,915
Next.

1087
01:26:19,999 --> 01:26:22,167
And where's the husband?

1088
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:24,211
He's in England, sir.

1089
01:26:24,253 --> 01:26:26,213
England, is it?

1090
01:26:26,255 --> 01:26:29,174
And where's the weekly telegram?
The big five pounds?

1091
01:26:29,216 --> 01:26:31,510
He didn't send us a penny in months, sir.

1092
01:26:31,594 --> 01:26:34,888
Well, we all probably know why, don't we?

1093
01:26:37,891 --> 01:26:39,351
No, sir.

1094
01:26:39,393 --> 01:26:42,730
We all know there's more than
an occasional Limerick man...

1095
01:26:42,813 --> 01:26:47,735
been seen trotting around with
a Piccadilly tart, don't we?

1096
01:26:47,776 --> 01:26:50,654
He's not in Piccadilly, sir.
He's in Coventry.

1097
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:55,659
Mam went begging
again at the St. Vincent de Paul.

1098
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:59,663
She got a food voucher so that at least
we could have a Christmas dinner.

1099
01:27:09,298 --> 01:27:11,633
And then, on Christmas Eve,

1100
01:27:11,717 --> 01:27:14,011
our neighbor, Walter the horse, died.

1101
01:27:14,094 --> 01:27:17,264
And our dad came home.

1102
01:27:17,306 --> 01:27:19,242
It's Pa!

1103
01:27:19,266 --> 01:27:21,268
Dad! Dad!

1104
01:27:42,664 --> 01:27:44,625
Hey.

1105
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:48,670
- We were expecting you yesterday.
- Aye, well.

1106
01:27:52,299 --> 01:27:54,468
Jesus and Mary,
what have you done to yourself?

1107
01:27:54,551 --> 01:27:56,553
Well, that Irish Sea
was very rough, you know.

1108
01:27:56,637 --> 01:28:01,433
Bumped my head. Nearly fell over the side.

1109
01:28:01,517 --> 01:28:03,597
Wouldn't be a fight, would it?
Wouldn't be the drink?

1110
01:28:05,646 --> 01:28:08,190
You said you'd bring us something.

1111
01:28:13,737 --> 01:28:16,490
Well, uh,

1112
01:28:16,532 --> 01:28:18,492
I have.

1113
01:28:24,706 --> 01:28:27,042
Got a bit peckish on the boat, did you?

1114
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:33,340
We'll have them tomorrow
after our Christmas dinner.

1115
01:28:34,383 --> 01:28:36,343
Did you bring any money?

1116
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,807
You drank the money, didn't you?

1117
01:28:43,684 --> 01:28:48,522
Well, times are hard, Angela.
Jobs are scarce.

1118
01:28:48,564 --> 01:28:53,026
- You drank the money, Da?
- You drank the money.

1119
01:28:57,948 --> 01:29:01,869
So they have no respect
for their father now, eh?

1120
01:29:05,789 --> 01:29:08,000
- I have to go and see a man.
- Go and see a man,

1121
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:10,669
but don't be coming home drunk,
singing your stupid songs.

1122
01:29:38,905 --> 01:29:40,949
Eat something. It's Christmas.

1123
01:29:42,868 --> 01:29:45,495
I'm not hungry.

1124
01:29:45,579 --> 01:29:47,890
But if no one wants them,
I'll have one of them sheep's eyes.

1125
01:29:47,914 --> 01:29:50,709
- Oh, not the eyes, Dad.
- Da, don't.

1126
01:29:50,792 --> 01:29:53,587
- Oh, Dad, don't.
- What's the matter with you?

1127
01:29:53,629 --> 01:29:56,757
You're notgoing to eat that, are you? Oh!

1128
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,593
Dad, oh, yuck.

1129
01:29:59,635 --> 01:30:02,054
- You're disgusting.
- Lovely.

1130
01:30:02,137 --> 01:30:05,599
There's great nourishment in the eyes.

1131
01:30:13,106 --> 01:30:15,025
Right.

1132
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,238
Where are you going?

1133
01:30:20,322 --> 01:30:22,240
Going to London.

1134
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:26,244
On Christmas Day?

1135
01:30:26,328 --> 01:30:28,288
It's the best day to travel.

1136
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:30,250
People in motorcars
are always willing to give...

1137
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:32,959
the working man a lift to Dublin.

1138
01:30:33,043 --> 01:30:35,629
Think of all the hard times
of the Holy Family and feel guilty.

1139
01:30:35,712 --> 01:30:37,923
How will you get to Holyhead?

1140
01:30:38,006 --> 01:30:41,718
Same way I came.

1141
01:30:41,802 --> 01:30:44,679
There's always a time
when no one's looking.

1142
01:30:52,854 --> 01:30:54,773
Right.

1143
01:30:59,194 --> 01:31:02,614
You be good boys, eh? Say your prayers.

1144
01:31:02,697 --> 01:31:04,616
Obey your mother.

1145
01:31:10,163 --> 01:31:13,166
I'll write.

1146
01:31:17,379 --> 01:31:19,297
Here, pass them down.

1147
01:31:22,342 --> 01:31:24,761
Mmm. I got a nut.

1148
01:31:24,845 --> 01:31:28,515
I didn't get a nut.
How come Frankie always gets a nut?

1149
01:31:28,557 --> 01:31:31,059
Nuts are good for sore eyes.

1150
01:31:31,143 --> 01:31:33,353
I've a Turkish Delight.

1151
01:31:33,436 --> 01:31:35,438
Will the nut make his eyes better?

1152
01:31:35,522 --> 01:31:37,440
'Twill.

1153
01:31:37,524 --> 01:31:39,442
One eye or two eyes?

1154
01:31:39,526 --> 01:31:42,320
Two eyes, I think.

1155
01:31:42,404 --> 01:31:46,324
Frankie, if I had a nut,
I'd give it to you. I would, really.

1156
01:31:46,408 --> 01:31:49,578
Mam, can me and Michael
have another chocolate? Just the one.

1157
01:32:32,203 --> 01:32:36,124
If I were in America,
I could say, "I love you, Dad,"

1158
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:38,543
the way they do in the films.

1159
01:32:38,627 --> 01:32:40,754
But in Limerick, they'd laugh at you.

1160
01:32:40,837 --> 01:32:42,797
In Limerick, you're only allowed to say...

1161
01:32:42,839 --> 01:32:45,926
you love God and babies
and horses that win.

1162
01:32:46,009 --> 01:32:48,970
Anything else is softness in the head.

1163
01:32:49,012 --> 01:32:51,681
Go home, Frankie.

1164
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:11,451
In another week,
a telegram arrived for three pounds,

1165
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:15,080
and we were in heaven.

1166
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:23,797
The next Saturday, there was no telegram.

1167
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,216
Nor the week after.

1168
01:33:26,299 --> 01:33:29,427
Nor any Saturday forever.

1169
01:33:59,582 --> 01:34:01,501
What are you doing?

1170
01:34:01,584 --> 01:34:04,504
Careful. We're making a fire.
It's freezing.

1171
01:34:04,587 --> 01:34:07,173
Come on, Frankie,
give us a hand, will you?

1172
01:34:07,257 --> 01:34:09,676
Oh! Yay!

1173
01:34:09,717 --> 01:34:12,720
Take the Pope, Michael.

1174
01:34:12,804 --> 01:34:14,764
Here, put the Pope on the bed.

1175
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:45,503
- Is that you, Frankie?
- 'Tis, Mrs. Purcell.

1176
01:34:45,545 --> 01:34:47,589
Come on in out of the cold, son.

1177
01:34:50,383 --> 01:34:53,261
Holy blessed God,
you're freezing with the cold, boy.

1178
01:35:03,104 --> 01:35:06,524
Isn't it grand, the radio, Frankie?

1179
01:35:06,566 --> 01:35:09,277
'Tis, Mrs. Purcell.

1180
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,530
Do you see Bedouins in the Sahara...

1181
01:35:12,614 --> 01:35:15,909
and the cowboys on the prairie?

1182
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:17,911
I do.

1183
01:35:17,952 --> 01:35:20,121
And people sipping wine in cafes.

1184
01:35:20,204 --> 01:35:23,875
And sailors in their galleons
sipping their cocoa.

1185
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:28,171
And plays about the Greeks, where they
have to pluck out their eyes...

1186
01:35:28,254 --> 01:35:30,840
because they married
their mothers by mistake.

1187
01:35:30,924 --> 01:35:34,427
And the Shakespeare.
I love the Shakespeare.

1188
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:37,263
Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes,
Mrs. Purcell.

1189
01:35:37,347 --> 01:35:39,390
You can'tget enough of them.

1190
01:35:39,432 --> 01:35:44,228
I'm sure Mr. Shakespeare
must have been an Irishman.

1191
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:48,483
If you want the things you love

1192
01:35:48,566 --> 01:35:51,736
You must have showers

1193
01:35:51,778 --> 01:35:55,281
Ah, Billie Holiday.

1194
01:35:57,075 --> 01:35:59,827
Oh, Billie, Billie.

1195
01:35:59,911 --> 01:36:01,955
I want to be with you in America.

1196
01:36:02,038 --> 01:36:03,957
There'll be pennies from heaven

1197
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,626
For you andme

1198
01:36:06,709 --> 01:36:09,462
Oh, America.

1199
01:36:09,545 --> 01:36:12,048
Where no one has bad teeth
and everyone has a lavatory.

1200
01:36:21,849 --> 01:36:24,769
Great God in heaven,
where's the other room?

1201
01:36:24,811 --> 01:36:26,771
What room?

1202
01:36:26,813 --> 01:36:28,981
I rented you two rooms
up here, and one is gone.

1203
01:36:29,065 --> 01:36:32,318
I distinctly remember a wall
because I distinctly remember a room.

1204
01:36:32,402 --> 01:36:35,113
- Where's that room gone?
- I don't remember a wall.

1205
01:36:35,196 --> 01:36:38,533
And if I don't remember a wall,
I can't remember a room.

1206
01:36:38,616 --> 01:36:41,661
I want to know where that wall is
and what she did with that room!

1207
01:36:41,744 --> 01:36:44,664
Do any of you remember a wall?

1208
01:36:44,706 --> 01:36:47,291
Is that the wall we burned in the fire?

1209
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:50,044
Dear God. This takes the bloody biscuit.

1210
01:36:50,128 --> 01:36:54,340
It's four weeks behind
in the rent you are, and now this.

1211
01:36:54,424 --> 01:36:56,551
Out, missus. I'm putting you out.

1212
01:36:56,634 --> 01:36:58,553
One week from today,
I'll knock on this door,

1213
01:36:58,636 --> 01:37:00,722
and I want to find nobody home.

1214
01:37:00,805 --> 01:37:04,183
Everybody out. Never to return.

1215
01:37:04,267 --> 01:37:06,894
'Tis a pity you weren't alive
when the English...

1216
01:37:06,978 --> 01:37:09,480
were evicting us
and leaving us on the road.

1217
01:37:09,522 --> 01:37:12,984
No lip from you, missus, or I'll send
the men to put you out tomorrow.

1218
01:37:13,025 --> 01:37:17,238
It's out on the pavement you'll be
with the sky peeing on your furniture.

1219
01:37:22,827 --> 01:37:25,746
Oh, dear God in heaven,
what am I going to do?

1220
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:28,708
Your cousin, Laman Griffin,
is living on the Rosbrien Road...

1221
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:30,710
in that little house of his mother's.

1222
01:37:30,793 --> 01:37:33,212
He'll surely take you in
till better times come.

1223
01:37:33,254 --> 01:37:35,256
I'll go and see him now.

1224
01:37:35,339 --> 01:37:38,217
Frankie, come with me.
And put your mac on.

1225
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:40,428
I haven't got a mac.

1226
01:37:40,511 --> 01:37:42,889
Jesus, what a family.

1227
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:52,023
Grandma caught a chill that day,

1228
01:37:52,064 --> 01:37:55,026
and the chill turned to pneumonia.

1229
01:37:55,067 --> 01:37:57,236
They shifted her
to the City Home Hospital,

1230
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:00,281
and when she died,
Mam said that herfamily...

1231
01:38:00,364 --> 01:38:03,659
was disappearing before her very eyes.

1232
01:38:14,212 --> 01:38:17,006
- Frankie, will you shut the door?
- Let's go.

1233
01:38:17,089 --> 01:38:19,550
- Right. Let's go.
- Malachy, the wheel's all bockety.

1234
01:38:19,592 --> 01:38:22,094
- Kaiser Bill marched over the hill
- Shut up, will you?

1235
01:38:22,136 --> 01:38:24,931
To fight the British Army

1236
01:38:25,014 --> 01:38:29,310
They're all going to know
we got the eviction. Will you be quiet?

1237
01:38:35,775 --> 01:38:39,153
And so Malachy, Michael, Mam, and me...

1238
01:38:39,237 --> 01:38:44,116
moved into mom's cousin's-
Laman Griffin-on the Rosbrien Road.

1239
01:38:47,662 --> 01:38:50,831
- Did you get the library books?
- I did.

1240
01:38:50,915 --> 01:38:54,502
Go in the yard and see if there's
something else to go on this fire.

1241
01:38:54,585 --> 01:38:58,005
- Is that for us?
- No, his lordship upstairs.

1242
01:38:58,089 --> 01:39:01,258
Why ask? It was the same every week-

1243
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:03,970
one steak, four potatoes, an onion,
and a bottle of stout.

1244
01:39:04,053 --> 01:39:06,472
Frankie, are you back?

1245
01:39:06,514 --> 01:39:08,474
Will you take up the books?

1246
01:39:17,566 --> 01:39:19,777
Good boy, Frankie.
Put them on the bed there.

1247
01:39:19,819 --> 01:39:21,821
Angela, the chamber pot is full.

1248
01:39:21,862 --> 01:39:24,657
Is there anything else
your lordship would like?

1249
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:27,135
Woman's work, Angela.
Woman's work and free rent.

1250
01:39:27,159 --> 01:39:29,495
- I'll empty it.
- You will?

1251
01:39:29,578 --> 01:39:33,416
Okay, Frankie. Take it outside
and rinse it under the tap.

1252
01:39:33,499 --> 01:39:35,710
And from now on, that will be your job.

1253
01:40:10,035 --> 01:40:14,206
America, wonderfull and of the Arapaho,

1254
01:40:14,248 --> 01:40:16,751
Cheyenne, Chippewa,

1255
01:40:16,834 --> 01:40:20,838
Sioux, Apache, Iroquois.

1256
01:40:20,921 --> 01:40:24,550
Poetry, boys. And the chiefs! Listen.

1257
01:40:24,592 --> 01:40:27,219
Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face,

1258
01:40:27,303 --> 01:40:29,388
Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse,

1259
01:40:29,472 --> 01:40:31,599
and the man himself,

1260
01:40:31,682 --> 01:40:34,685
the genius Geronimo.

1261
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:41,442
Stock your minds, boys,
and you can move through the world...

1262
01:40:41,484 --> 01:40:43,736
resplendent.

1263
01:40:43,777 --> 01:40:46,906
Clarke, define "resplendent."

1264
01:40:46,989 --> 01:40:50,826
- I think it's shining, sir.
- Pithy but adequate.

1265
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:53,537
McCourt, give us a sentence with "pithy."

1266
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:58,792
Clarke is pithy but adequate, sir.

1267
01:40:58,876 --> 01:41:01,086
Adroit, McCourt.

1268
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:04,757
You have a mind for the priesthood,
my boy, or politics.

1269
01:41:06,592 --> 01:41:09,094
Tell you mother to come and see me.

1270
01:41:09,136 --> 01:41:11,138
Hoppy O'Halloran told Mam...

1271
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:13,140
to take me to the Christian Brothers-

1272
01:41:13,224 --> 01:41:16,477
to say he sent me,
and I was a bright boy...

1273
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,479
and ought to be going
to secondary school...

1274
01:41:18,562 --> 01:41:20,606
and maybe to university even.

1275
01:41:20,648 --> 01:41:22,733
I wish he'd mind his own business.

1276
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,878
I want to quit school forever and get
a job with wages every Friday night...

1277
01:41:24,902 --> 01:41:26,963
I want to quit school forever and get
a job with wages every Friday night...

1278
01:41:26,987 --> 01:41:30,699
and go to the pictures
every Saturday like everybody else.

1279
01:41:30,783 --> 01:41:32,743
I've come to see Brother Murray.

1280
01:41:32,826 --> 01:41:34,930
I don't know why we bothered.
They took one look at us...

1281
01:41:34,954 --> 01:41:39,458
- What do you want?
- This is my son Frank.

1282
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:42,211
And said no.

1283
01:41:45,005 --> 01:41:47,216
Francis, will you listen to me?

1284
01:41:47,258 --> 01:41:49,260
Are you listening?

1285
01:41:49,343 --> 01:41:51,262
I am.

1286
01:41:51,345 --> 01:41:54,265
You're never to let anybody slam
the door in your face again.

1287
01:41:54,348 --> 01:41:56,392
Do you hear me?

1288
01:41:56,475 --> 01:41:58,435
I do.

1289
01:41:59,853 --> 01:42:04,733
Impurity. I say again, impurity.

1290
01:42:04,817 --> 01:42:08,529
Impurity is so grave a sin...

1291
01:42:09,947 --> 01:42:13,117
the Virgin Maryturns
her face away and weeps.

1292
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:16,286
She weeps when she looks down...

1293
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:18,330
that long, dreary vista of time...

1294
01:42:18,414 --> 01:42:22,584
and beholds in horror
the spectacle of Limerick boys...

1295
01:42:22,668 --> 01:42:26,755
defiling themselves, polluting themselves,

1296
01:42:26,839 --> 01:42:31,301
soiling their young bodies
which are the temple of the Holy Ghost.

1297
01:42:31,385 --> 01:42:34,263
Interfering with themselves.

1298
01:42:34,346 --> 01:42:37,808
We pray to the Virgin Mary
to say we're sorry...

1299
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:41,603
because we can't stop
interfering with ourselves.

1300
01:42:41,687 --> 01:42:44,064
- The dong!
- The dong!

1301
01:42:44,148 --> 01:42:46,358
- The prick!
- The prick!

1302
01:42:46,442 --> 01:42:49,403
- The dick!
- The dick!

1303
01:42:49,486 --> 01:42:51,405
- The langer!
- The langer!

1304
01:42:51,488 --> 01:42:53,615
- The excitement!
- The excitement!

1305
01:42:53,699 --> 01:42:57,828
- The excitement?
- Yeah, the excitement.

1306
01:42:57,911 --> 01:43:00,789
Yeah, I heard of that.

1307
01:43:04,835 --> 01:43:08,881
Paddy Clohessy found
a priest to confess our hideous sins to.

1308
01:43:08,964 --> 01:43:13,844
He's 90 years old and deaf as a turnip.

1309
01:43:13,927 --> 01:43:15,846
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1310
01:43:15,929 --> 01:43:19,933
It's been ages since me last confession.
I've been masturbating.

1311
01:43:20,017 --> 01:43:22,561
Except one day,
he died and didn't tell us.

1312
01:43:22,644 --> 01:43:25,397
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1313
01:43:25,481 --> 01:43:28,066
It's been a fort-

1314
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:32,821
It's been a fortnight
since my last confession.

1315
01:43:32,863 --> 01:43:35,199
And what have you done
since then, my child?

1316
01:43:35,282 --> 01:43:40,245
I, uh, I hit my brother.

1317
01:43:40,329 --> 01:43:42,247
I lied to my mother.

1318
01:43:42,331 --> 01:43:44,875
Yes, my child. And what else?

1319
01:43:46,418 --> 01:43:50,130
Uh, I did dirty things, Father.

1320
01:43:50,214 --> 01:43:54,927
Ah, mychild, was that with yourself
or with another?

1321
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:57,054
Or with some class of beast?

1322
01:43:57,137 --> 01:44:00,724
Beast?

1323
01:44:00,807 --> 01:44:03,352
I never heard ofa sin like that, Father.

1324
01:44:03,435 --> 01:44:05,562
This priest must be from the country.

1325
01:44:05,646 --> 01:44:08,148
He's opening up new worlds for me.

1326
01:44:24,748 --> 01:44:27,376
I'll just take him up his last mug of tea.

1327
01:45:02,202 --> 01:45:04,121
It's a disgrace...

1328
01:45:04,204 --> 01:45:06,623
that boys like McCourt...

1329
01:45:06,707 --> 01:45:09,793
and Clarke and Kennedy...

1330
01:45:09,876 --> 01:45:14,715
have to hew wood and draw water...

1331
01:45:14,798 --> 01:45:18,969
in this so-called free
and independent Ireland...

1332
01:45:19,052 --> 01:45:23,932
that keeps a class system
foisted on us by the English.

1333
01:45:24,016 --> 01:45:26,852
Well, it disgusts me.

1334
01:45:26,935 --> 01:45:30,605
We throw our talented children
onto the dung heap.

1335
01:45:30,689 --> 01:45:33,275
If this is the end of school for you,

1336
01:45:33,358 --> 01:45:37,654
you must get out of this country,
boys, and go to America.

1337
01:45:39,406 --> 01:45:42,075
McCourt, do you hear me?

1338
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:43,994
I do, sir.

1339
01:45:45,579 --> 01:45:49,249
Laman Griffin was drunk every night.

1340
01:45:49,332 --> 01:45:52,669
Worst still was Fridays when we had
to watch him eat his fish and chips.

1341
01:45:52,753 --> 01:45:54,963
Woman, boil some water for tea.

1342
01:45:55,047 --> 01:45:58,008
We've no coal or turf.

1343
01:45:58,050 --> 01:46:00,010
You useless great lump,

1344
01:46:00,052 --> 01:46:02,637
living free under me roof
with you snotty-nosed pack of brats.

1345
01:46:02,721 --> 01:46:05,265
You.

1346
01:46:05,348 --> 01:46:08,518
Go to the shop for a few sods
and some kindling.

1347
01:46:08,602 --> 01:46:11,730
Come on. Or are you as useless
as your mother?

1348
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,859
Did you empty the chamber pot today?

1349
01:46:15,942 --> 01:46:18,487
Shite. I left it on the stairs.

1350
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:21,740
You stand there with your thick gob
and tell me you didn't do it?

1351
01:46:21,823 --> 01:46:25,660
I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now.

1352
01:46:25,744 --> 01:46:29,122
- He couldn't do it.
- Shut up, woman.

1353
01:46:29,206 --> 01:46:31,646
It was his last day at school,
and he had to go to the doctor.

1354
01:46:31,708 --> 01:46:33,502
I said, shut up, woman!

1355
01:46:33,585 --> 01:46:35,625
You can't tell us to shut up.
You're not our father!

1356
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:40,258
If I have to get up from this table,
you'll be calling for your patron saint.

1357
01:46:40,342 --> 01:46:42,677
Shut your gob.

1358
01:46:42,761 --> 01:46:45,305
I'll kill you!

1359
01:46:45,388 --> 01:46:48,683
- You're not my father!
- Stop it!

1360
01:46:48,767 --> 01:46:51,686
Leave him alone, sweet Jesus. Stop it!

1361
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:54,981
He doesn't mean any harm.
He's only a child.

1362
01:46:55,065 --> 01:46:57,108
And he's to start work
at the post office on Monday.

1363
01:46:57,192 --> 01:46:59,110
Give me a fag, woman.

1364
01:46:59,194 --> 01:47:01,863
I'm telling you,
that boy is a little shite.

1365
01:47:01,947 --> 01:47:03,990
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

1366
01:47:04,074 --> 01:47:05,992
I'm going to bed.

1367
01:47:10,497 --> 01:47:13,124
I heard them talking.

1368
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:16,586
I heard the sound of Laman's boots
as he scraped his way to bed.

1369
01:47:16,628 --> 01:47:18,922
I thought Mam would come
and kiss me goodnight,

1370
01:47:19,005 --> 01:47:22,801
to say thank you for sticking up for her.

1371
01:47:24,469 --> 01:47:27,222
But no. She went to him.

1372
01:47:55,458 --> 01:47:57,919
Where are you going, Frankie?

1373
01:47:58,003 --> 01:47:59,921
I'm leaving.

1374
01:48:00,005 --> 01:48:01,923
Why are you leaving, Frankie?

1375
01:48:02,007 --> 01:48:06,136
Because if I stay,
I'll take a knife to his neck.

1376
01:48:06,219 --> 01:48:08,972
Will you kill him?

1377
01:48:09,055 --> 01:48:11,224
Go to sleep, Malachy.

1378
01:49:13,953 --> 01:49:16,706
You're not having my chips.

1379
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:21,544
I just wanted to stay
the night, Uncle Pat.

1380
01:49:21,586 --> 01:49:24,005
All right.

1381
01:49:24,089 --> 01:49:26,758
You can stay in me mother's bed.

1382
01:49:26,841 --> 01:49:29,552
- Don't expect me to feed you, though.
- I won't.

1383
01:49:29,677 --> 01:49:33,098
There's not a scrap of food in the house.

1384
01:49:37,268 --> 01:49:39,562
What happened to your face?

1385
01:49:39,646 --> 01:49:42,190
It's all swole.

1386
01:49:42,273 --> 01:49:45,985
Did someone punch you?

1387
01:49:46,069 --> 01:49:48,112
Yeah.

1388
01:49:48,196 --> 01:49:50,740
Who was punching you?

1389
01:49:50,824 --> 01:49:53,243
Joe Louis.

1390
01:49:53,326 --> 01:49:55,203
Joe Louis?

1391
01:49:58,289 --> 01:50:00,375
I thought he lived in America.

1392
01:50:00,458 --> 01:50:02,710
Was he visiting Limerick?

1393
01:50:02,794 --> 01:50:04,754
He was, Uncle Pat.

1394
01:50:04,796 --> 01:50:08,758
That's not right, him hitting a wee boy...

1395
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,177
and him being heavyweight champion
of America and all.

1396
01:50:11,261 --> 01:50:14,097
The world champion he is, Uncle Pat.

1397
01:50:14,138 --> 01:50:16,975
That's worse.

1398
01:50:17,058 --> 01:50:19,227
And look at you, so skinny.

1399
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:21,771
Those arms wouldn't lift two stamps.

1400
01:50:23,606 --> 01:50:27,193
Some things is most peculiar, Frankie.

1401
01:50:29,195 --> 01:50:31,114
I'm off to bed.

1402
01:50:44,085 --> 01:50:46,129
I was so hungry.

1403
01:50:46,212 --> 01:50:49,424
I sat there and licked the front page
and all the headlines.

1404
01:50:49,507 --> 01:50:54,304
I licked the great attacks
of Patton and Montgomery.

1405
01:50:54,345 --> 01:50:56,055
I licked the sports pages.

1406
01:50:56,139 --> 01:50:58,641
I licked the market prices
of eggs and butter and bacon.

1407
01:50:58,725 --> 01:51:03,062
I sucked that paper until my face was
as black as Al Jolson's.

1408
01:51:06,316 --> 01:51:08,735
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

1409
01:51:41,017 --> 01:51:42,935
Let's go, Patty.

1410
01:51:45,021 --> 01:51:48,441
We have to get you-Up you go.

1411
01:51:48,524 --> 01:51:50,693
Come on, Pat, up the steps.

1412
01:51:50,777 --> 01:51:52,737
How did you let him get this drunk?

1413
01:51:52,779 --> 01:51:54,739
Drink never hurt anyone, did it?

1414
01:51:54,781 --> 01:51:57,909
- I want a drink.
- Tomorrow.

1415
01:51:57,992 --> 01:51:59,911
- Push him, Pa.
- I'm pushing. I'm pushing.

1416
01:51:59,994 --> 01:52:02,246
Come on, Pat.

1417
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:06,417
Christ, you're taking
both sides of the room.

1418
01:52:09,128 --> 01:52:11,672
What are you doing
in this house, in that bed?

1419
01:52:11,756 --> 01:52:14,425
Get up and put the kettle
on for your poor Uncle Pat...

1420
01:52:14,509 --> 01:52:16,594
that fell down the worse for drink.

1421
01:52:19,222 --> 01:52:22,391
Mother of God!

1422
01:52:22,475 --> 01:52:24,811
You're wearing me dead mother's dress.

1423
01:52:24,894 --> 01:52:27,021
I washed my clothes for the big job.

1424
01:52:27,105 --> 01:52:30,608
- What big job?
- Telegram boy at the post office.

1425
01:52:30,691 --> 01:52:33,444
If the post office
are taking on the likes of you,

1426
01:52:33,528 --> 01:52:35,988
- they must be in a desperatestate.
- Ah, Frankie.

1427
01:52:36,072 --> 01:52:38,616
You look... gorgeous.

1428
01:52:38,699 --> 01:52:41,661
Jesus, what did you wash these in?

1429
01:52:41,744 --> 01:52:45,206
- Carbolic soap.
- They smell like dead pigeons!

1430
01:52:45,289 --> 01:52:47,625
You'll make a show of us.

1431
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:59,470
What time do you have to be at that job?

1432
01:52:59,512 --> 01:53:01,472
9:00.

1433
01:53:01,514 --> 01:53:04,767
Tell them that your aunt was waiting
for you and that's why you're late.

1434
01:53:04,809 --> 01:53:06,894
Late? Why do I have to be late?

1435
01:53:06,978 --> 01:53:10,773
Just shut up and do what
you're bloody well told.

1436
01:53:11,983 --> 01:53:15,111
Mmm. That's more like it.

1437
01:53:15,194 --> 01:53:18,155
I often wondered
why Aunt Aggie was always so angry.

1438
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:20,157
But you're going to need a new shirt.

1439
01:53:20,241 --> 01:53:22,285
And shoes, not boots. Shoes.

1440
01:53:22,326 --> 01:53:25,037
Compared to Mam, she had everything,

1441
01:53:25,121 --> 01:53:27,331
and she didn't have any kids
to keep her poor.

1442
01:53:27,415 --> 01:53:30,960
And here she is buying me clothes
for my new job.

1443
01:53:31,043 --> 01:53:33,504
That's grand.

1444
01:53:33,588 --> 01:53:36,132
Here's two shillings
to get tea and a bun for your birthday.

1445
01:53:38,634 --> 01:53:41,846
You look so smart,
people will think you've robbed a bank.

1446
01:53:51,314 --> 01:53:55,359
She certainly
was a mystery, my Aunt Aggie.

1447
01:53:55,443 --> 01:53:57,778
A complete mystery.

1448
01:54:07,496 --> 01:54:11,500
We know every avenue, road, street...

1449
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:15,421
terrace, mews, place, close and lane.

1450
01:54:15,504 --> 01:54:18,007
You don't have to have a hanker

1451
01:54:18,090 --> 01:54:20,885
To be a broker or banker

1452
01:54:20,968 --> 01:54:25,056
No, sirree, just simply be
my mother's son-in-law

1453
01:54:25,139 --> 01:54:27,558
Needn't even think of tryin'

1454
01:54:27,642 --> 01:54:29,977
To be a mighty social lion

1455
01:54:30,061 --> 01:54:34,315
Sippin' tea if you will be
my mother's son-in-law

1456
01:54:34,398 --> 01:54:36,942
There isn't a door
in Limerick we don't know.

1457
01:54:37,026 --> 01:54:40,071
We knock on all kinds of doors-
iron, oak, plywood.

1458
01:54:40,154 --> 01:54:44,742
Twenty thousand doors. We knock,
kick, push. We ring and buzz bells.

1459
01:54:46,744 --> 01:54:49,580
Risking life and limb
as we fight off everydog...

1460
01:54:49,622 --> 01:54:52,249
who wants to turn us into dinner.

1461
01:54:52,333 --> 01:54:55,503
There are telegrams
for the houses of priests.

1462
01:54:55,586 --> 01:54:56,837
God bless you.

1463
01:54:56,921 --> 01:54:59,590
But if you waited for tips
from nuns and priests,

1464
01:54:59,673 --> 01:55:02,385
you'd surely die on their doorsteps.

1465
01:55:02,551 --> 01:55:04,071
You're lucky to get the Carmody telegram.

1466
01:55:04,095 --> 01:55:05,137
I am?

1467
01:55:05,221 --> 01:55:07,139
They're big tippers.
You'll get a shilling.

1468
01:55:07,223 --> 01:55:09,141
How come I got the telegram?

1469
01:55:09,225 --> 01:55:11,268
- 'Cause nobody else will go there.
- Why?

1470
01:55:11,352 --> 01:55:13,604
'Cause Theresa Carmody's
got the consumption.

1471
01:55:19,819 --> 01:55:23,030
You don't have to speak like that so

1472
01:55:23,114 --> 01:55:25,408
You can tell the world I said so

1473
01:55:25,449 --> 01:55:30,121
Can't you see you got to be
my mother's son-in-law

1474
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:40,131
I heard that sick people like Theresa...

1475
01:55:40,214 --> 01:55:42,133
know that they haven't got long to live...

1476
01:55:42,216 --> 01:55:46,137
and so it makes them mad
for love and romance...

1477
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:48,264
and dirty things ingeneral.

1478
01:55:48,347 --> 01:55:51,767
- Telegram.
- That's what they say, anyway.

1479
01:55:51,809 --> 01:55:56,730
- You're all wet and bleeding.
- I skidded on me bike.

1480
01:55:56,814 --> 01:56:00,025
Come in. I'll put something on your cuts.

1481
01:56:00,109 --> 01:56:02,611
I wonder should I go in.

1482
01:56:02,653 --> 01:56:04,655
I might get the consumption.

1483
01:56:04,738 --> 01:56:07,449
That'll be the end of me,
and I'll never get to America.

1484
01:56:07,533 --> 01:56:11,579
- Come in. You'll perish standing there.
- I need the shilling tip.

1485
01:56:22,089 --> 01:56:24,425
Oh, you big poltroon.

1486
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:29,763
Now that's better.

1487
01:56:29,847 --> 01:56:33,976
Why don't you take off your clothes
and dry them on the screen there?

1488
01:56:34,059 --> 01:56:36,020
Uh, no.

1489
01:56:36,061 --> 01:56:37,771
Ah, do.

1490
01:56:37,855 --> 01:56:40,733
I will.

1491
01:57:04,381 --> 01:57:07,343
Lord, you might be scrawny,

1492
01:57:07,426 --> 01:57:09,970
but that's a fine boyo you have there.

1493
01:57:10,137 --> 01:57:14,350
My head is full
of sin and fear of consumption.

1494
01:57:14,433 --> 01:57:16,352
Her green eyes...

1495
01:57:16,435 --> 01:57:19,480
and my shilling tip.

1496
01:57:19,563 --> 01:57:22,983
And she's on top of me,
and I might be killing myself...

1497
01:57:23,025 --> 01:57:25,235
catching consumption from her mouth.

1498
01:57:25,319 --> 01:57:27,613
I'm riding to heaven.
I'm falling off a cliff.

1499
01:57:27,655 --> 01:57:30,824
And if this is a sin,
I don't give a fiddler's fart.

1500
01:57:35,079 --> 01:57:37,164
Fuck off, you bollocks!

1501
01:57:39,875 --> 01:57:43,170
Your mouth is a lavatory, McCourt.
Did you hear me?

1502
01:57:43,212 --> 01:57:46,423
- I did, Miss Barry.
- You've been heard on the stairs.

1503
01:57:46,507 --> 01:57:49,468
- Yes, Miss Barry.
- Shut up, McCourt.

1504
01:57:49,551 --> 01:57:52,221
- I will, Miss Barry.
- Not another word, McCourt.

1505
01:57:52,304 --> 01:57:54,515
- No, Miss Barry.
- I said shut up, McCourt.

1506
01:57:54,556 --> 01:57:56,225
All right, Miss Barry.

1507
01:57:56,308 --> 01:57:59,937
That's the end of it,
McCourt. Don't try me.

1508
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:01,689
I- I won't, Miss Barry.

1509
01:58:01,730 --> 01:58:04,942
- Mother of God, give me patience!
- Yes, Miss Barry.

1510
01:58:08,570 --> 01:58:10,572
Take the last word, McCourt.

1511
01:58:10,656 --> 01:58:13,450
Take it. Take it. Take it!

1512
01:58:18,747 --> 01:58:21,291
I will, Miss Barry.

1513
01:58:41,437 --> 01:58:43,772
What do you want most in the world?

1514
01:58:45,274 --> 01:58:47,234
To go to America.

1515
01:58:48,944 --> 01:58:51,071
What do you want most?

1516
01:58:51,155 --> 01:58:54,658
Oh, to fall in love
with some gorgeous man.

1517
01:58:54,741 --> 01:58:58,036
Oh, hold me, Frankie.

1518
01:59:20,976 --> 01:59:22,811
Uncle Pat?

1519
01:59:26,732 --> 01:59:29,318
Hello, Frankie.

1520
01:59:39,369 --> 01:59:41,580
How's the job?

1521
01:59:41,663 --> 01:59:44,750
Grand.

1522
01:59:44,833 --> 01:59:46,960
Uncle Pat lookin' after you?

1523
01:59:47,002 --> 01:59:48,962
He is.

1524
01:59:49,004 --> 01:59:51,673
But I can look after meself.

1525
01:59:53,383 --> 01:59:55,344
That's good.

1526
01:59:55,427 --> 01:59:59,056
- You're getting enough to eat, I see.
- Lam.

1527
01:59:59,139 --> 02:00:01,141
Would you like a chip?

1528
02:00:01,183 --> 02:00:03,560
No.

1529
02:00:08,690 --> 02:00:11,526
Michael and little Alphie are fine.

1530
02:00:11,610 --> 02:00:13,612
That's good.

1531
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:17,199
We all miss Malachy. He's, uh-

1532
02:00:17,282 --> 02:00:20,619
- Miss him? He-
- He's gone to join the army band!

1533
02:00:20,702 --> 02:00:23,664
- Playin' the bugle.
- The bugle?

1534
02:00:23,705 --> 02:00:26,500
Can you imagine that, playin' the bugle?
Playin' the fool, more like.

1535
02:00:26,541 --> 02:00:31,338
That's Malachy, all right.

1536
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:33,465
Mad Malachy.

1537
02:00:41,682 --> 02:00:45,018
I miss him too.

1538
02:01:14,589 --> 02:01:17,300
- Telegram, Mrs. Carmody.
- Thank you.

1539
02:01:17,384 --> 02:01:21,388
I usually deliver the telegram
to your daughter.

1540
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:24,099
- Theresa, isn't it?
- Theresa's in the sanatorium.

1541
02:01:43,285 --> 02:01:47,414
Please, God, it wasn't Theresa's fault.

1542
02:01:47,497 --> 02:01:51,626
The excitement on the sofa
is what the consumption does to you.

1543
02:01:51,710 --> 02:01:53,753
I love her, God,

1544
02:01:53,795 --> 02:01:57,716
just like St. Francis loved
any bird or beast or fish.

1545
02:01:57,799 --> 02:02:00,635
Please, God, take the consumption away,

1546
02:02:00,677 --> 02:02:03,013
and I promise I'll never
go near her again.

1547
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:22,866
Anima eius, et animae
omnium fidelium defunctorum,

1548
02:02:22,949 --> 02:02:27,329
per misericordiam Dei,
requiescant in pacem.

1549
02:02:28,413 --> 02:02:30,582
Amen.

1550
02:02:35,003 --> 02:02:38,089
I want to tell
the priest and Theresa's mam and dad...

1551
02:02:38,173 --> 02:02:41,343
that it was me, Frank McCourt,
the dirty rotten thing...

1552
02:02:41,426 --> 02:02:43,637
that sent Theresa straight to hell.

1553
02:02:46,181 --> 02:02:49,809
I think of Theresa, cold in her coffin,

1554
02:02:49,851 --> 02:02:52,312
the red hair, the green eyes.

1555
02:02:54,147 --> 02:02:56,107
I can't understand what I feel,

1556
02:02:56,191 --> 02:03:00,153
but I know that with all the people
who died in my family...

1557
02:03:00,195 --> 02:03:03,198
and all the people who died
in the lanes around me,

1558
02:03:03,281 --> 02:03:06,159
I never had a pain like this in my heart,

1559
02:03:06,201 --> 02:03:08,495
and I hope Inever will again.

1560
02:03:13,041 --> 02:03:15,877
And then, as luck would have it,
I had to deliver a telegram...

1561
02:03:15,961 --> 02:03:18,046
to the moneylender, Mrs. Finucane,

1562
02:03:18,129 --> 02:03:21,049
and St. Francis
smiled down on me once more.

1563
02:03:29,849 --> 02:03:32,102
How old are you, boy?

1564
02:03:32,185 --> 02:03:34,604
Fifteen and some, missus.

1565
02:03:34,688 --> 02:03:36,773
Old enough and ugly enough.

1566
02:03:36,856 --> 02:03:38,775
Yes, missus.

1567
02:03:38,858 --> 02:03:41,444
But are you smart, boy?
Are you in any way intelligent?

1568
02:03:42,570 --> 02:03:44,531
I can read and write, Mrs. Finucane.

1569
02:03:44,614 --> 02:03:46,895
There are people in the lunatic asylum
can read and write.

1570
02:03:46,950 --> 02:03:49,661
- Can you write a letter?
- I can, Mrs. Finucane.

1571
02:03:49,744 --> 02:03:52,706
I'll give you three pence
for every letter you write,

1572
02:03:52,789 --> 02:03:54,791
and three pence if it brings in a payment.

1573
02:03:54,874 --> 02:03:58,920
Come on Thursday. Bring your own paper
and envelopes with you.

1574
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:05,301
"O'Brien, Donnolley, Meagher, Hannon,

1575
02:04:05,385 --> 02:04:07,929
old Mrs. Keneally, Mulcahy, Ahern."

1576
02:04:07,971 --> 02:04:10,640
We'll see how you do
with that lot for a start.

1577
02:04:10,724 --> 02:04:14,561
Threaten them, boy.
Threaten the life out of them.

1578
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:18,022
How does this sound?

1579
02:04:18,106 --> 02:04:20,024
"Dear Mrs. O'Brien:

1580
02:04:20,108 --> 02:04:24,279
In as much as you have not seen fit
to pay me what you owe me,

1581
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:26,740
I may be forced to resort to legal action.

1582
02:04:26,823 --> 02:04:31,745
There's your son, Michael, parading
around the world in his new suit,

1583
02:04:31,828 --> 02:04:33,663
which I paid for,

1584
02:04:33,747 --> 02:04:38,293
while I myself have barely a crust
to keep body and soul together."

1585
02:04:38,376 --> 02:04:42,797
"I am sure you don't want to languish
in the dungeons of Limerick jail,

1586
02:04:42,839 --> 02:04:44,966
far from friends and family.

1587
02:04:45,049 --> 02:04:48,344
I remain yours in lit-lit-"

1588
02:04:48,428 --> 02:04:51,473
- What are these words, boy?
- Litigious anticipation.

1589
02:04:52,849 --> 02:04:54,809
That's a powerful letter.

1590
02:04:56,186 --> 02:04:59,355
This word, "in as much."

1591
02:04:59,439 --> 02:05:02,650
That's a holy terror of a word.
What does it mean?

1592
02:05:02,692 --> 02:05:05,778
It means, "this is your last chance."

1593
02:05:07,739 --> 02:05:10,158
She gives me money for stamps,

1594
02:05:10,241 --> 02:05:13,244
but I deliver the letters myself
and keep the money.

1595
02:05:35,099 --> 02:05:39,938
What class of a demon would torment
her own kind with a letter like that?

1596
02:05:39,979 --> 02:05:43,691
It's truly awful.

1597
02:05:43,775 --> 02:05:45,360
What's up with Mrs. Hannon?

1598
02:05:45,443 --> 02:05:48,613
That old bitch Finucane sent her
a threatening letter. Look.

1599
02:05:48,696 --> 02:05:51,282
People who write letters
like that should be boiled in oil...

1600
02:05:51,366 --> 02:05:54,244
and then have their fingernails
pulled out by blind people.

1601
02:05:56,621 --> 02:05:58,623
That's great.
Thanks very much. Next, please.

1602
02:06:00,166 --> 02:06:02,210
I'm sorry for their troubles,

1603
02:06:02,293 --> 02:06:05,922
but there's no other way for me to save
the money for the trip to America.

1604
02:06:09,050 --> 02:06:11,594
If the whole of Ireland
was dying of hunger,

1605
02:06:11,678 --> 02:06:14,555
I wouldn't touch this money
in the post office.

1606
02:06:14,681 --> 02:06:18,142
Thanks, John. Listen here to me, men.

1607
02:06:18,226 --> 02:06:20,144
Listen a second.

1608
02:06:20,186 --> 02:06:23,106
This is my nephew here, Frankie McCourt,
the son of Angela Sheehan,

1609
02:06:23,189 --> 02:06:25,108
the sister of my wife,
having his first pint.

1610
02:06:25,191 --> 02:06:27,527
Here's to your health
and long life, Frankie.

1611
02:06:27,568 --> 02:06:30,905
May you live to enjoy the pint,
but not too much, eh?

1612
02:06:36,869 --> 02:06:39,497
Slow down, slow down.

1613
02:06:39,539 --> 02:06:42,166
Don't drink it all at once.

1614
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:48,006
In Mountjoy jail one Monday morning

1615
02:06:48,089 --> 02:06:53,052
High upon the gallows tree

1616
02:06:53,136 --> 02:06:58,016
Kevin Barry gave his young life

1617
02:06:58,057 --> 02:07:02,437
For the cause of liberty

1618
02:07:05,565 --> 02:07:10,903
Just a lad of 18 summers

1619
02:07:10,945 --> 02:07:13,614
And no-

1620
02:07:22,248 --> 02:07:25,209
What kind of state
is that to come home in?

1621
02:07:29,589 --> 02:07:31,591
Up, boys, up!

1622
02:07:31,674 --> 02:07:34,093
The Red Branch Knights!

1623
02:07:34,135 --> 02:07:36,596
The Fenian men!

1624
02:07:36,637 --> 02:07:38,890
The glorious I.R.A.!

1625
02:07:38,931 --> 02:07:41,726
I can't believe you.
It's your father you've become.

1626
02:07:41,768 --> 02:07:43,811
Tonight-

1627
02:07:47,482 --> 02:07:49,442
Tonight, I had me first pint.

1628
02:07:49,484 --> 02:07:52,195
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1629
02:07:52,278 --> 02:07:54,572
My first pint with Uncle Pa.

1630
02:07:54,614 --> 02:07:56,699
Uncle Pa should know better.

1631
02:07:56,783 --> 02:08:00,203
No father around to get me my first pint.

1632
02:08:00,286 --> 02:08:02,997
Your father was no good
to anyone, and neither are you.

1633
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:05,082
You're just like him, you drunken feck!

1634
02:08:05,166 --> 02:08:10,505
I'd rather be like my father
than like your Laman Griffin!

1635
02:08:10,588 --> 02:08:12,882
Mind your tongue. You're drunk.

1636
02:08:12,965 --> 02:08:16,344
Mind your own tongue.

1637
02:08:16,427 --> 02:08:19,055
You and Laman Griffin!

1638
02:08:20,473 --> 02:08:23,601
You slut!

1639
02:08:23,643 --> 02:08:26,312
You've a mouth on you worse than
your drunken eejit father!

1640
02:08:26,395 --> 02:08:29,440
Better to be like
my drunken eejit father than like...

1641
02:08:29,524 --> 02:08:32,985
that fat, disgustin' shite Laman Griffin,

1642
02:08:33,027 --> 02:08:35,446
who you crept up to every night
there back at Rosbrien!

1643
02:08:35,488 --> 02:08:39,033
- Shut up!
- Laman Griffin. Laman Griffin.

1644
02:08:39,116 --> 02:08:41,702
Up in the loft with Laman Griffin!

1645
02:08:41,786 --> 02:08:43,788
Squeak, squeak, squeak,

1646
02:08:43,829 --> 02:08:46,332
with fat Laman Griffi n
rollin' on top of you!

1647
02:08:46,374 --> 02:08:49,502
- Shut up! Shut up!
- You fuckin' shut up, you slut!

1648
02:09:21,492 --> 02:09:25,162
My child. Tell me what troubles you.

1649
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:31,168
- I'm 16 today, Father.
- Mm-hmm?

1650
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:34,797
- I drank my first pint last night.
- Yeah.

1651
02:09:36,882 --> 02:09:39,218
I hit my mother.

1652
02:09:40,886 --> 02:09:43,055
God help us.

1653
02:09:46,392 --> 02:09:48,352
But He will forgive you.

1654
02:09:49,603 --> 02:09:51,731
Is there anything else?

1655
02:09:51,772 --> 02:09:53,733
I can't tell you, Father.

1656
02:09:53,774 --> 02:09:57,111
Would you like to go to confession?

1657
02:09:57,153 --> 02:10:00,197
I- I can't, Father.

1658
02:10:00,281 --> 02:10:04,201
- I did terrible things.
- Well, you can tell St. Francis.

1659
02:10:04,285 --> 02:10:06,287
You can tell St. Francis.

1660
02:10:07,997 --> 02:10:11,834
We'll sit here, and you can tell
St. Francis...

1661
02:10:11,917 --> 02:10:14,420
all the things that trouble you.

1662
02:10:18,132 --> 02:10:23,429
I tell St. Francis
about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene.

1663
02:10:24,805 --> 02:10:26,766
He treads the upper-

1664
02:10:28,642 --> 02:10:31,395
My father singing "Kevin Barry"
and bringing home no money.

1665
02:10:34,273 --> 02:10:37,151
My father sending no money from England.

1666
02:10:37,234 --> 02:10:40,404
Theresa on the sofa.

1667
02:10:40,488 --> 02:10:43,949
My terrible sins
of interfering with myself,

1668
02:10:44,033 --> 02:10:46,118
wankin' all over Limerick and beyond.

1669
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:47,411
What do you want?

1670
02:10:47,495 --> 02:10:50,456
The Christian Brother who
closed the door in my face.

1671
02:10:51,665 --> 02:10:53,876
The tears in Mam's eyes
when I slapped her.

1672
02:10:59,423 --> 02:11:03,344
A- A-And I give her me back
this morning, Father,

1673
02:11:03,427 --> 02:11:07,848
even though it's me birthday
and she offered me a cup of tea.

1674
02:11:10,726 --> 02:11:13,604
Ego te absolvo apeccatis tuis.

1675
02:11:13,687 --> 02:11:18,025
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

1676
02:11:18,067 --> 02:11:22,321
Say three Our Fathers,
three Hail Marys and three Glory Bes.

1677
02:11:24,365 --> 02:11:27,451
But what about Theresa Carmody
in hell, Father?

1678
02:11:27,535 --> 02:11:30,371
No, my child, surely she is in heaven.

1679
02:11:30,412 --> 02:11:34,667
You don't think the sisters in the
hospital let her die without a priest?

1680
02:11:34,708 --> 02:11:37,044
- Are you sure, Father?
- I am.

1681
02:11:37,127 --> 02:11:39,171
God forgives you,
and you must forgive yourself.

1682
02:11:39,213 --> 02:11:41,590
God loves you, and you must love yourself.

1683
02:11:41,674 --> 02:11:45,844
For only when you love God and yourself
can you love all God's creatures.

1684
02:11:58,732 --> 02:12:01,193
Thank you, St. Francis.

1685
02:12:22,923 --> 02:12:25,426
Mrs. Finucane.

1686
02:12:25,467 --> 02:12:27,553
It's Frank. I have your sherry.

1687
02:13:52,471 --> 02:13:54,723
All the names are here.

1688
02:13:54,807 --> 02:13:57,184
Me Mam. Two pounds for Christmas.

1689
02:13:57,267 --> 02:13:59,812
Aunt Aggie. Nine pounds.

1690
02:13:59,895 --> 02:14:01,980
Maybe for my post office clothes.

1691
02:14:02,064 --> 02:14:05,234
Bridey Hannon forointment
for Mr. Hannon's legs.

1692
02:14:05,317 --> 02:14:10,614
Mrs. Purcell, Clohessy, Quigley, Molloy.

1693
02:14:10,697 --> 02:14:14,743
Everyone I know and half of the poor
of Limerick are here.

1694
02:14:14,827 --> 02:14:18,247
They allowed the old bitch money.

1695
02:14:18,330 --> 02:14:20,707
Well, not anymore.

1696
02:14:39,935 --> 02:14:42,771
Not to America, not by plane.

1697
02:14:42,855 --> 02:14:45,691
I can put you on a ship, though,

1698
02:14:45,732 --> 02:14:48,735
that leaves Cork in a couple of weeks.
The Irish Oak.

1699
02:14:48,819 --> 02:14:52,239
That'll cost you 55 pounds.
Do you have it?

1700
02:14:54,241 --> 02:14:56,451
I do.

1701
02:14:58,495 --> 02:15:02,791
And as he was leaving his mother

1702
02:15:02,874 --> 02:15:06,753
Standing upon the quay

1703
02:15:06,795 --> 02:15:10,632
She threw her arms around his waist

1704
02:15:10,716 --> 02:15:14,094
- And this to him didsay
- Here you are.

1705
02:15:14,177 --> 02:15:15,721
Everybody now.

1706
02:15:15,762 --> 02:15:20,851
A mother's love's a blessing

1707
02:15:20,934 --> 02:15:25,564
No matter where you roam

1708
02:15:25,606 --> 02:15:29,359
Keep her while she's living

1709
02:15:29,443 --> 02:15:33,780
You'll miss her when she's gone

1710
02:15:33,822 --> 02:15:38,076
Love her as in childhood

1711
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:41,830
Though feeble, old and grey

1712
02:15:41,913 --> 02:15:46,418
For you'll never miss a mother's love

1713
02:15:46,501 --> 02:15:49,630
Till she's buried beneath the clay

1714
02:15:49,671 --> 02:15:52,507
Fair play to you, Angela. That was mighty.

1715
02:15:52,549 --> 02:15:55,635
Well, Frankie, your bladder must be
very close to your eye.

1716
02:15:55,677 --> 02:15:58,221
This night is turning into
a proper wake altogether.

1717
02:15:58,305 --> 02:15:59,385
Is there any possibility...

1718
02:15:59,431 --> 02:16:01,975
of somebody singing something
to liven up the proceedings...

1719
02:16:02,017 --> 02:16:03,769
before I'm driven to drink from sadness?

1720
02:16:03,852 --> 02:16:05,771
- Oh, I forgot!
- What?

1721
02:16:05,854 --> 02:16:07,898
The eclipse.
The moon is having an eclipse tonight.

1722
02:16:07,981 --> 02:16:09,983
- What's an eclipse?
- Come on, all of you.

1723
02:16:10,067 --> 02:16:12,527
We'd look a right shower of eejits
if we missed that.

1724
02:16:22,871 --> 02:16:25,332
What's gonna happen?

1725
02:16:25,415 --> 02:16:28,835
This is a very good sign
for you going to America, Frankie.

1726
02:16:28,877 --> 02:16:33,840
It's a bad sign. I read that the moon
is practicing for the end of the world.

1727
02:16:33,882 --> 02:16:36,134
End of the world, my arse.

1728
02:16:53,652 --> 02:16:56,238
Would you look at that!

1729
02:17:02,077 --> 02:17:05,747
- Well, isn't that somethin'?
- Wow! Isn't that grand?

1730
02:17:07,999 --> 02:17:10,794
- It's beautiful.
- We might never see that again.

1731
02:17:10,877 --> 02:17:13,421
Not in our life time, anyway.

1732
02:17:17,759 --> 02:17:19,928
Was that it, then?

1733
02:17:23,431 --> 02:17:26,143
'Tis only the beginning
for Frankie McCourt.

1734
02:17:26,226 --> 02:17:31,189
He'll be back in a few years with a new
suit and fat on his bones like any Yank.

1735
02:17:31,273 --> 02:17:35,193
And a lovely girl with pearly white teeth,
and her hangin' from his arm.

1736
02:17:35,277 --> 02:17:36,945
Ah, no, Pa.

1737
02:17:41,283 --> 02:17:44,077
Come on back inside, Angela,
and we'll have a drop of sherry.

1738
02:17:48,415 --> 02:17:51,877
- Good luck in America, Frankie.
- Good luck to you.

1739
02:18:15,191 --> 02:18:17,444
Good luck to ya, Frankie.

1740
02:18:17,468 --> 02:18:20,468
