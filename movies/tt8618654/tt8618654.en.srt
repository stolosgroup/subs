00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,196
<i>Planet Earth,</i>
<i>home to a growing number of Homo sapiens</i>

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,115
<i>and a whole lot of other creatures.</i>

4
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>It's a great place to live.</i>

5
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,414
<i>When it comes</i>
<i>to the future of our small planet…</i>

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,460
Now to a dire warning
about climate change.

7
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,755
Natural disasters
like hurricanes or wildfires…

8
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,091
<i>An unprecedented decline</i>
<i>in nature threatening humanity.</i>

9
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,636
<i>Sixth mass extinction event</i>
<i>is already well underway…</i>

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,557
<i>There's so much bad news</i>
<i>about our planet, it's overwhelming.</i>

11
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,144
<i>The fear that we're headed for a cliff</i>

12
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,774
<i>puts most of us into a state of paralysis.</i>

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,571
The truth is…

14
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,199
I've given up.

15
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,910
<i>And the odds are so have you.</i>

16
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,997
<i>But what if there was another path?</i>

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,174
This is the story of a simple solution,
a way to heal our planet

18
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>and keep our species</i>
<i>off the extinction list.</i>

19
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,724
<i>In fact, the solution</i>
<i>I'm talking about is right under our feet,</i>

20
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,354
and it's as old as dirt.

21
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,274
<i>We call it soil, earth, or ground.</i>

22
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,984
<i>And due to its vast scale,</i>

23
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:54,864
<i>and its ability to sequester</i>
<i>immense quantities of greenhouse gases,</i>

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,451
<i>it could just be the one thing</i>
<i>that can balance our climate,</i>

25
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,454
<i>replenish our fresh water supplies,</i>

26
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>and feed the world.</i>

27
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,545
<i>That's why some people</i>
<i>are racing to save our soil</i>

28
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,507
<i>in hopes our soil just might…</i>

29
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,302
<i>save us.</i>

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,317
<i>I am a conservation agronomist.</i>

31
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>I have been in every state,</i>

32
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:39,033
<i>all the way from Alaska,</i>
<i>to Puerto Rico, to Hawaii.</i>

33
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:44,622
<i>I've also been asked</i>
<i>to go speak in Europe, Australia…</i>

34
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,207
<i>I just haven't had the time.</i>

35
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,920
<i>If we get the soil right,</i>
<i>we can fix a lot of our issues.</i>

36
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,924
<i>Healthy soils lead to a healthy plant.</i>

37
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,802
<i>Healthy plant, healthy animal,</i>
<i>healthy human,</i>

38
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,805
<i>healthy water, healthy climate.</i>

39
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,350
This is what this is about today.

40
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:09,397
Learning how the soil works
and learning how to farm like nature does.

41
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,818
I have learned my job is to drop a seed.

42
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,614
And the more you farm like nature,
the more we can reduce your inputs,

43
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,699
and the more money you can make.

44
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,786
It's my calling. Just as simple as that.

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,330
Actually, this is one…

46
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,999
<i>I've lived in four or five states.</i>

47
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,169
<i>Everywhere I go and work,</i>
<i>we're still having the same problem.</i>

48
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,630
<i>Massive erosion.</i>

49
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,930
Erosion is when soil becomes dirt.

50
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,272
<i>Rapid erosion began long ago</i>
<i>when humans developed the plow.</i>

51
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>Its purpose was to break the soil</i>
<i>in order to sow seeds.</i>

52
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,281
<i>By the Bronze Age,</i>

53
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,535
<i>vast areas around cities</i>
<i>were plowed up to plant grains.</i>

54
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,499
<i>But as their soils eroded,</i>

55
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:14,128
<i>those once-great empires</i>
<i>vanished into dust.</i>

56
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,426
<i>But we don't have</i>
<i>to look back thousands of years</i>

57
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,512
<i>to see the dangers of erosion.</i>

58
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,349
<i>In the 1930s,</i>

59
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,687
<i>America experienced the largest</i>
<i>man-made environmental disaster</i>

60
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,688
<i>in history.</i>

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,485
<i>It was called the Dust Bowl.</i>

62
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:44,575
<i>It was largely caused by farmers</i>
<i>tilling the once-fertile Midwestern Plains</i>

63
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,370
<i>and leaving the soil exposed.</i>

64
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,582
<i>By the end of 1934,</i>

65
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:56,462
<i>roughly 200 million acres of cropland</i>
<i>were permanently damaged.</i>

66
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,635
<i>On a whistle stop train tour,</i>
<i>President Franklin D. Roosevelt saw</i>

67
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,722
<i>the destruction</i>
<i>of America's soil firsthand.</i>

68
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:11,311
<i>In response,</i>
<i>he created the Soil Conservation Service</i>

69
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,354
<i>to save the nation's soil.</i>

70
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,277
What I have seen confirms me

71
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,323
in the belief
that I've had for a long time…

72
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,452
that we're going to win on this problem.

73
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:34,125
It relates to working out
a plan of cooperation with nature

74
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,962
instead of going along
with what we've been doing in the past

75
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,797
trying to buck nature.

76
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,224
<i>The practice of plowing</i>
<i>and tilling the soil</i>

77
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,893
<i>continues to this day.</i>

78
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,483
<i>But so does Franklin D. Roosevelt's</i>
<i>Soil Conservation Service.</i>

79
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,237
<i>It was made part</i>
<i>of the US Department of Agriculture,</i>

80
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,076
<i>and it's now called the Natural</i>
<i>Resources Conservation Service,</i>

81
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,994
<i>the NRCS.</i>

82
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:15,083
We want the water
to leave through a living plant.

83
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,586
<i>Today, the NRC</i>
<i>has field agents, like Ray,</i>

84
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,005
<i>trying to teach farmers</i>
<i>to reduce tilling…</i>

85
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,426
Microbes live in there,
and that's called the porous sphere.

86
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,429
…A<i>nd reduce the spraying</i>
<i>of industrial chemicals</i>

87
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,014
<i>that damage the soil.</i>

88
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,308
Tillage is one of the most
intrusive things we do

89
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,684
in modern agriculture.

90
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,228
It is not our friend.

91
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,899
<i>The message is simple,</i>

92
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:46,447
<i>but getting that message out…</i>
<i>is difficult.</i>

93
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,662
We have a social problem.
We have an education issue.

94
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:57,291
And until we get that right,
we can't fix our ecological issues.

95
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,710
I have been in NRCS for 31 years.

96
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,797
<i>It's kind of amazing to me</i>
<i>as I was teaching all over the country.</i>

97
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,802
<i>I'm going, wow, our producers</i>
<i>don't really know how the soil works.</i>

98
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,389
<i>They don't understand</i>
<i>the basic ecological principles.</i>

99
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,724
<i>Everything runs by carbon.</i>

100
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,105
<i>We're built by carbon.</i>
<i>The soil microbes run by carbon.</i>

101
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,899
<i>Carbon is the driving engine.</i>

102
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,818
It runs the system.

103
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,865
<i>But when it comes</i>
<i>to the role of carbon in our world,</i>

104
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,701
<i>there's… a bit of confusion.</i>

105
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,956
<i>To be specific, carbon dioxide is a gas.</i>

106
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,710
<i>We breathe it out,</i>
<i>and plants breathe it in.</i>

107
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,800
<i>We also make carbon dioxide</i>
<i>by burning fossil fuels.</i>

108
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,927
<i>But carbon isn't bad.</i>

109
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,681
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it's the basis for all life on Earth.</i>

110
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,643
<i>There's a tendency right now</i>
<i>for us to be at war with carbon.</i>

111
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,936
Carbon's the bad guy.

112
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,148
And I think this is a lost opportunity.
Carbon's the good guy.

113
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,025
We're carbon.

114
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,027
I'm-I'm 16 percent carbon,

115
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,613
and all of it came from eating vegetation

116
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,490
and things that eat vegetation.

117
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,576
Plants use sunlight as energy,

118
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,412
and they pull carbon dioxide
out of the atmosphere,

119
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,372
they turn it into a carbon fuel,

120
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,832
and that's how they grow.

121
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:28,549
But 40 percent of that carbon fuel,
they send down to their roots.

122
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,180
They're leaking it out in a very
strategic way to soil microorganisms.

123
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,683
Plants are feeding
soil microorganisms carbon,

124
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:42,021
and the soil microorganisms
are bringing plants mineral nutrients.

125
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,398
And in the process of all that,

126
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:49,820
those soil microorganisms make
a carbon glue out of that carbon fuel.

127
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,031
And they make habitat in the soil.

128
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:56,452
They make little pockets in the soil
to control the flow of air and water.

129
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,997
And that's one of the ways
that carbon gets fixed in the soil.

130
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,293
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>soil has the unique ability</i>

131
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,797
<i>to sequester carbon dioxide</i>
<i>out of the atmosphere.</i>

132
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,716
<i>That's a big deal.</i>

133
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,970
<i>And what's even more amazing:</i>

134
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:18,057
<i>the soil contains</i>
<i>an entire universe of life.</i>

135
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,229
Here, I went to years of college,
and I took soil science. I didn't know.

136
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,148
I really did not know how the soil worked.

137
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,109
It's alive.

138
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,160
In every handful of healthy soil,

139
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,997
there more organisms than the number
of people who've ever lived

140
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,914
on planet Earth.

146
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,307
<i>and putting the nutrients</i>
<i>into a form that the plant needs.</i>

147
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,935
<i>Comparing the soil microbial diversity</i>

148
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,064
<i>to the microbial diversity we're now</i>
<i>seeing inside the human organism,</i>

<i>in your body than you have human cells.</i>

150
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:16,490
Yeah, we're about one percent human
and 99 percent microbes.

151
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,034
It's the truth.

152
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,412
<i>The food that we eat,</i>

153
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:26,792
<i>we actually chew and break</i>
<i>that food material down into little bits</i>

154
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,378
<i>that get eaten by the bacteria in our gut.</i>

155
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,633
When you eat kale,
let's say,

156
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,719
when you're eating kale,
your body doesn't consume kale.

157
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,055
The bacteria consumed the kale.

158
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,561
And you feed off of what the bacteria
have processed and released

159
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,355
by the consumption of that kale.

160
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,484
The key to health is eating dirt.

161
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,488
What I mean by that
is we need to eat what's in the dirt

162
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,741
that's transferred to the plants,
that then we eat and create health.

163
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,916
You know,
my husband is an athlete for a living,

164
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:12,296
so he wants to provide his body
with the best possible nutrients

165
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,631
so he can perform.

166
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,639
I beat my body down so much
over the course of the season,

167
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,100
the last thing I want to do
is add a bunch of food

168
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,477
that I won't be able to properly digest,

169
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,563
that won't be the kind of nutrition
that I need

170
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,192
in order to repair and regenerate
my body the way that it needs to be.

171
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,573
And, of course,
the quality of the soil is huge

172
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,577
because it is the beginning
of the quality of the food.

173
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,623
That quality of food
provides quality health.

174
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,500
It all comes from the Earth. Big Mama.

175
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,047
Our health and the health
of our planet are connected.

176
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,764
If we choose healthy food,
there is a reciprocation.

177
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,728
Not only we feel better, we are healthier,
but the Earth is healthier.

178
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,318
<i>Taking care of the microbes</i>
<i>in the soil is critical for human health.</i>

179
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,448
<i>But spraying the soil</i>
<i>with toxic chemicals,</i>

180
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,409
<i>well, does something else.</i>

181
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:30,541
All of our soils that are under
chemical conventional agriculture

182
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:34,587
are almost completely devoid
of microorganisms.

183
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,928
<i>Spraying the soil</i>
<i>with toxic chemicals</i>

184
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,932
<i>kills the very microbes we need</i>
<i>to give us health,</i>

185
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,351
<i>and pull the carbon from the atmosphere.</i>

186
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,190
<i>The more tilling that's done,</i>
<i>the weaker the soil gets,</i>

187
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,486
<i>and the more farmers feel compelled</i>
<i>to use chemical sprays.</i>

188
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,659
<i>This is the vicious cycle</i>
<i>of industrial agriculture.</i>

189
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,457
<i>And that cycle</i>
<i>was developed as a result of war.</i>

190
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,090
<i>The roots of industrial agriculture</i>
<i>go back to a German scientist</i>

191
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,592
<i>named Fritz Haber.</i>

192
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:29,975
<i>Haber invented a process</i>
<i>for making synthetic nitrogen fertilizer</i>

193
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,936
<i>that increased food production.</i>

194
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,815
<i>His other scientific breakthrough</i>
<i>was the creation of poisons</i>

195
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,318
<i>known as pesticides.</i>

196
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,574
<i>Haber used his pesticides</i>
<i>as the first chemical weapons in history.</i>

197
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,666
<i>Then he developed the poison</i>
<i>used in the gas chambers of the Holocaust.</i>

198
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,631
<i>When the war ended,</i>

199
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:05,010
<i>US chemical companies</i>
<i>brought Haber's poisons back to America</i>

200
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,349
<i>and rebranded</i>
<i>his toxic chemicals as pesticides</i>

201
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,934
<i>for American farms.</i>

202
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,356
<i>Dow set out to demonstrate</i>
<i>the effectiveness of its chemical killers</i>

203
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,191
<i>on a nationwide scale.</i>

204
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,153
When the war ended,

205
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:28,409
all the energy that went
into fighting the enemies in the world…

206
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,579
went into fighting
the enemies on the farm.

207
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,707
All of a sudden,

208
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,167
chemical fertilizer nitrogen
was available,

209
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,003
and farmers could toss that on a field.

210
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,132
Even if they hadn't
taken care of their soil,

211
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,593
they could get a good crop for a while.

212
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,305
<i>Together, these wartime innovations</i>

213
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,267
<i>created the most powerful</i>
<i>industrial food production system</i>

214
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,145
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

215
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,451
<i>We created an infrastructure</i>
<i>around single types of industry,</i>

216
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,414
<i>and then we decoupled livestock</i>
<i>and row crop production.</i>

217
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,292
<i>We found people</i>
<i>who are really good at raising livestock,</i>

218
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,878
<i>and you found people</i>
<i>who were really good at growing row crops,</i>

219
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,880
<i>and you split those two camps.</i>

220
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,719
<i>That ushered</i>
<i>in this big philosophical shift</i>

221
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,138
<i>in terms of how we approached farming.</i>

222
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:35,100
Instead of understanding
and honoring natural processes,

223
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,810
we could just throw out these chemicals.

224
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,521
We just throw out more and more of them.

225
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,191
It kept going up and up and up.

226
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,948
It takes more nitrogen now
to raise a bushel of grain

227
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,866
than it did in 1960.

228
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,496
Our chemical fertilizers
mask the problem of degraded soils.

229
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:01,168
Modern agriculture was not designed
for the betterment of the soil.

230
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,716
<i>Today, our most common crops</i>
<i>are genetically altered</i>

231
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,095
<i>to resist the spraying</i>
<i>of toxic pesticides.</i>

232
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,184
<i>For example, the number one crop</i>
<i>in the United States, field corn,</i>

233
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,188
<i>is almost entirely sprayed</i>
<i>with glyphosate,</i>

234
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,151
<i>a chemical suspected</i>
<i>to cause cancer that's so over sprayed,</i>

235
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,823
<i>it's found its way</i>
<i>into our drinking water.</i>

236
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,703
<i>These chemicals,</i>

237
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,581
<i>which were considered dangerous</i>
<i>to begin with,</i>

238
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:44,336
<i>are now being used at rates</i>
<i>that would have been inconceivable</i>

239
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,421
<i>twenty years ago.</i>

240
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,009
<i>Every year,</i>
<i>for every American alive,</i>

241
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:54,471
<i>three pounds of toxic chemicals</i>
<i>are sprayed onto the food</i>

242
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,098
<i>grown on our farms.</i>

243
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,894
That goes into the soil.
It goes into the water.

244
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,104
It goes into our bodies.

245
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,941
It's not just on the food you eat.
It's everywhere.

246
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:12,156
<i>Most of the agricultural</i>
<i>industries' pesticides and herbicides</i>

247
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,118
<i>transfer directly through breast milk</i>
<i>to babies.</i>

248
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,624
<i>There are over 200 peer-reviewed studies</i>

249
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,336
<i>that correlate the spraying</i>
<i>of these toxic chemicals</i>

250
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,214
<i>to effects like ADD in children,</i>

251
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,634
<i>pediatric cancers, and birth defects.</i>

252
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:40,100
<i>That's why juries have begun</i>
<i>to award billions of dollars in damages</i>

253
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,729
<i>to people who contracted cancer</i>
<i>after using glyphosate.</i>

254
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:50,235
We know, for example, that glyphosate,
which is also known as Roundup,

255
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,821
has an effect on the gut microbiome

256
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,366
that may lead to disturbances
that can create disease,

257
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,659
including cancer.

258
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,664
<i>A big reason these chemicals make us sick</i>

259
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:07,002
<i>is because just as toxic chemicals</i>
<i>kill the microbes in the soil,</i>

260
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,673
<i>they also kill the microbes in our bodies.</i>

261
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,637
What I tell people is,
your body can handle acute stresses,

262
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,890
but it cannot handle chronic stresses.

263
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,434
The soil ecosystem is the same way.

264
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,771
If you keep dumping the fungicides,
you keep dumping the herbicide,

265
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,357
you keep dumping the insecticide,
you keep doing the tillage…

266
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,567
chronic stress.

267
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,778
It doesn't function anymore.

268
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,458
<i>Since chemical agriculture</i>
<i>ramped up worldwide in the 1970s,</i>

269
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,296
<i>we have lost one third</i>
<i>of the Earth's topsoil.</i>

270
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,802
<i>But industrial agriculture</i>
<i>isn't just harming our soils.</i>

271
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,681
<i>It's also affecting something much larger.</i>

272
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:12,609
The most massive tsunami,

273
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,364
perfect storm, is bearing down upon us.

274
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,910
But fossil fuels…
carbon, coal, and gas…

275
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,582
are by no means the only thing
that is causing climate change.

276
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,502
Now, because the fate of water and carbon

277
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,214
are tied to soil organic matter,

278
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:38,093
when we damage soils, you give off carbon.

279
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,262
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.

280
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,937
<i>Healthy soils</i>
<i>absorb water and carbon dioxide.</i>

281
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:55,986
<i>But when we destroy soil,</i>
<i>it releases water and carbon dioxide.</i>

282
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:02,159
<i>This dries out the soil</i>
<i>and turns it into dust.</i>

283
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,540
<i>The process is called desertification.</i>

284
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,252
<i>And how we deal with it</i>

285
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,381
<i>could determine the fate</i>
<i>of more than just our climate.</i>

286
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,680
<i>Desertification is a fancy word</i>

287
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,099
<i>for land that is turning to desert,</i>

288
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:31,021
<i>and this happens</i>
<i>only when we create too much bare ground.</i>

289
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,407
<i>Soil and the plant</i>
<i>and the climate are connected.</i>

290
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,539
<i>If you don't have a living plant,</i>

291
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,543
<i>you're going to have more evaporation.</i>

292
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,463
<i>What we want is transpiration,</i>

293
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,716
<i>when the moisture leaves</i>
<i>through the plant.</i>

294
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,512
<i>When it does that, it increases humidity.</i>

295
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,723
<i>And when it increases the humidity,</i>
<i>we have more rain.</i>

296
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:15,274
<i>Sixty percent of our rainfall</i>
<i>comes from the ocean.</i>

297
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:20,153
<i>But a lot of people don't realize</i>
<i>40 percent comes from small water cycles</i>

298
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,740
<i>where our rain comes from inland.</i>

299
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,080
What's going on
is we disrupted the small water cycles.

300
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:35,460
That's when you have too much
sensible heat coming off bare soil.

301
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,923
You're having
these huge vortexes of hot air going out.

302
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,845
Instead of attracting the rain,
it's pushing the rain clouds away.

303
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,642
<i>Take one square meter of soil</i>
<i>and make it bare,</i>

304
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,104
<i>and I promise you,</i>
<i>you will find it much colder at dawn</i>

305
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:58,775
<i>and much hotter at mid-day</i>
<i>than that same piece of ground</i>

306
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,944
<i>if it's just covered with plant litter.</i>

307
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,614
<i>You have changed the microclimate.</i>

308
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,451
<i>Now, by the time you're doing that…</i>

309
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,123
<i>on more than half the world's land…</i>

310
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,880
<i>you are changing macroclimate.</i>

311
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,601
<i>Desertification of our soils</i>
<i>is a pressing threat to our climate</i>

312
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,061
<i>and our species.</i>

313
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,315
<i>But I have for you a very simple message.</i>

314
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,985
<i>About two-thirds</i>
<i>of the world is desertifying.</i>

315
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,909
<i>As soils turn to dust around the world,</i>

316
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,705
<i>every year, 40 million people</i>
<i>are pushed off their land.</i>

317
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,546
<i>By 2050,</i>
<i>it's estimated that one billion people</i>

318
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,092
<i>will be refugees of soil desertification.</i>

319
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:13,892
More than 20 civilizations,
in all regions of the world, have failed

320
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,687
because of agriculture
damaging the environment.

321
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,816
Their communities could not handle

322
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,194
the deteriorating environment
and the rising population.

323
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,156
Globally, that's what we're doing today.

324
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,498
Poor land leads to poor people.

325
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,794
Poor people leads to social breakdown.

326
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,635
Poor land leads to increasing frequency
of floods and droughts,

327
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:53,598
and mass immigration
across borders and into cities.

328
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,770
And it's leading
to ideal recruitment conditions.

329
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,860
What we know right now

330
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,029
is the way we're feeding ourselves

331
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:13,451
is undermining the very ecology
that we're dependent upon.

332
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:19,541
So the long-term prognosis
for our survival on this planet,

333
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,670
given business as usual,
is very, very poor.

334
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,970
<i>According to the United Nations,</i>

335
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:37,517
<i>the world's remaining topsoil</i>
<i>will be gone within 60 years.</i>

336
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:44,858
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>unless we find a way to save our soils,</i>

337
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,570
<i>we have 60 harvests left.</i>

338
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,958
<i>The global scale of the problems we face</i>
<i>may seem insurmountable.</i>

339
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,838
<i>But in every fight that seems unwinnable,</i>

340
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,176
<i>there are those who refuse to give up.</i>

341
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:17,766
Oh, let's see. Let's do that.
We'll do a couple of demos.

342
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,702
We're very fortunate
to have Ray Archuleta with us today.

343
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,331
Ray, as you can tell, is someone
that has quite a bit of notoriety.

344
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,668
He's got his own--
He's got his own reality show. Now, that--

345
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,630
With that,
I'm gonna turn the floor over to Ray,

346
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,048
and, Ray, we appreciate you being here.

347
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,007
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, Ray.

348
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,472
This is a supercomputer model by NASA.

349
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,935
We're concerned
of the red and purples being CO2.

350
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,064
I want you to notice the dates.

351
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,984
That is February.

352
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:11,861
March.

353
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,117
Now, what are we doing March? April?

354
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,954
What do we do
in modern agriculture in April?

355
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,374
We are tilling.

356
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,632
We're tilling the land.

357
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,470
And look at the huge plumes of CO2.

358
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,889
Look at the dates.

359
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,225
May.

360
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:48,815
Now, let's see what happens around June.

361
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,569
Look at the colors change.

362
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,782
Ladies and gentlemen,
what is happening in June?

363
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,417
Do you see how powerful
the living plants are?

364
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,544
Can you imagine
if we had all our rangeland

365
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,005
and all our cropland covered?

366
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,884
A covered planet is a healthy planet.

367
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,138
We can fix a lot of our climate issues

368
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,350
if we bring the CO2 down
into a living plant

369
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,852
and put it back into the soil
where it belongs.

370
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,155
Agriculture is the biggest way
that humans impact our landscape.

371
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,952
We have unleashed, through agriculture,

372
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,039
over the centuries, over the millennia,
carbon from the land,

373
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,415
and it's now up in the atmosphere.

374
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,668
It's now part
of that legacy load of carbon dioxide.

375
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:57,217
Many people are coming
to this discussion about soil health

376
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,220
because it can bring that carbon back down

377
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,638
and put it in the ground.

378
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,683
First, he's an environmentalist
and the editor of <i>Drawdown,</i>

379
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,687
the most comprehensive plan
ever proposed to reverse global warming.

380
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,189
Please welcome Paul Hawken.

381
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,318
Tell us why your plan is different
and why it is the most comprehensive.

382
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,987
Well, it's very different
because it's the first one ever.

383
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,156
Wow.

384
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,412
You cannot achieve drawdown
without bio sequestration.

385
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,666
Bio sequestration
is using plants, trees, perennials,

386
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,587
and techniques of grazing and farming
to capture carbon

387
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,340
and store it in the sink of the soil,

388
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,219
and retain it for decades,
if not centuries.

389
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,056
What we did is mapped,
measured, and modeled

390
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,060
the hundred most substantive solutions
to global warming.

391
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,439
And what I mean by solutions,
I mean things that are at hand.

392
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,524
We know how to do it. There's scaling.

393
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,446
And if we continue to scale in a rigorous,
but reasonable way, over 30 years,

394
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,449
we can reverse global warming.

395
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,789
When you talk to people
about this great technology

396
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,710
that has existed for millions of years

397
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:18,339
that takes carbon out of the atmosphere
and stores it safely in the soil,

398
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,469
and that it's called plants
working with soil microorganisms,

399
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,803
it seems too simple.

400
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:31,895
<i>Putting our atmospheric carbon</i>
<i>down into our soil may be a simple idea,</i>

401
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,857
<i>but to do it on a global scale requires…</i>

402
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,650
<i>politics.</i>

403
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,696
<i>And when it comes</i>
<i>to the politics of climate change,</i>

404
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,239
<i>well, let's just say…</i>

405
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,659
<i>there's a lot of hot air.</i>

406
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:59,464
<i>In 2015, the United Nations</i>
<i>held a climate summit in Paris.</i>

407
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,759
<i>It was called COP 21.</i>

408
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:09,474
<i>Forty thousand delegates</i>
<i>from 196 countries from all over the world</i>

409
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,520
<i>met to reach an agreement</i>
<i>on how to address climate change.</i>

410
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,859
<i>There were presentations and meetings</i>

411
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,363
<i>and speeches, and speeches,</i>

412
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,907
<i>and speeches.</i>

413
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,159
<i>My name is Bunkin.</i>

414
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,954
<i>Please touch my screen.</i>

415
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,710
<i>And there was one proposal</i>
<i>that offered real hope,</i>

416
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,880
<i>and it was presented by this guy.</i>

417
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:51,182
<i>I come from a village</i>
<i>in the region called "La Sarthe,"</i>

418
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,019
<i>a small village, with a population of 256</i>

419
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:59,065
<i>who were involved</i>
<i>in the world of rural farming.</i>

420
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,400
<i>There were lots of farmers.</i>

421
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,152
<i>So I was interested in farming</i>
<i>very early in life.</i>

422
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,411
<i>France maintains the largest</i>
<i>agricultural science institution</i>

423
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,412
<i>in Europe.</i>

424
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,539
<i>It's called INRA,</i>

425
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,667
<i>and it's been studying soil</i>
<i>for over a hundred years.</i>

426
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:25,216
<i>INRA recently developed a program</i>
<i>called the Four for 1000 Initiative.</i>

427
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,721
<i>Their goal is to increase</i>
<i>the carbon content of the world's soils</i>

428
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:33,016
<i>by .4 percent annually.</i>

429
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,686
<i>That would sequester</i>
<i>the same amount of carbon</i>

430
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,147
<i>that humanity emits each year.</i>

431
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,114
The soil environment

432
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,866
can hold more carbon

433
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:55,705
than the atmosphere and plants living
on the surface of the soil combined.

434
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,960
We have an incredible ability to be able
to store that carbon in the soil

435
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,630
in a relatively short period of time.

436
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,134
The primary tool of farming is the soil.

437
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,972
It's not the tractor.
It's not the combine-harvester.

438
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,058
It's not the satellite. It's the soil.

439
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,646
What's really at stake here

440
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,024
is what happens after COP 21 in Paris.

441
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,570
If all people here
can become aware of the role of the soil,

442
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,908
and if people can get that the soil
can be loaded up with carbon,

443
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,535
and then after that,

444
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,332
we must all take action
to achieve these objectives.

445
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,714
<i>At a side meeting at COP 21,</i>

446
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,760
<i>Monsieur Le Foll,</i>
<i>the French Minister of Agriculture,</i>

447
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:55,848
<i>presented an idea</i>
<i>that just might change the world.</i>

448
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,438
Ladies, gentlemen, and dear colleagues,

449
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:07,860
with all the farmland, but also,
with all the soils of the forests,

450
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,697
we have an enormous potential.

451
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,034
The fact that we are able
to implement an actual answer

452
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,161
to the struggle against climate change,

453
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,539
an answer that could equal
the same amount

454
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,499
as the amount of carbon
humanity emits each year.

455
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,376
That's colossal.

456
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,714
Four parts per thousand
is the capacity all of us have together

457
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,757
to be able to succeed.

458
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,675
Thank you.

459
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,806
<i>At the Four for 1000 event,</i>

460
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,435
<i>many countries signed</i>
<i>Stéphane Le Foll's pledge</i>

461
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,271
<i>to draw carbon down into their soils.</i>

462
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:49,861
Thirty countries from around
the world signing on to, what I believe,

463
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:54,198
is going to be one of the most
significant changes in agriculture.

464
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,160
Because to achieve this Four for 1000,

465
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,913
we have to change
the way we do agriculture.

466
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:05,126
<i>And doing agriculture</i>
<i>in a way that sequesters carbon</i>

467
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:09,338
<i>requires a radical reduction</i>
<i>in toxic pesticides,</i>

468
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,592
<i>GMOs, and synthetic chemicals.</i>

469
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,597
<i>But the three largest contributors</i>
<i>to carbon dioxide</i>

470
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,560
<i>and the three largest agricultural</i>
<i>producers were missing from the agreement.</i>

471
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:28,024
<i>India, the United States, and China</i>
<i>did not show.</i>

472
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,197
Does it frustrate you that
America did not sign on to the agreement?

473
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,782
Yes, it's frustrating.

474
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,578
Because this is the first time
an entire country, France,

475
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:44,290
yes, a smaller country than the US,
but a big agricultural country,

476
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,753
has proposed a global
and political initiative

477
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,007
that links together
the fight against global warming

478
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,842
with changing the way we farm.

479
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,637
But when it comes to the US,
they're not there yet.

480
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,351
<i>And after all that,</i>
<i>the United States announced</i>

481
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,938
<i>that it had pulled</i>
<i>entirely out of the Paris Agreement.</i>

482
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,735
<i>If we are going to succeed</i>
<i>in balancing our climate,</i>

483
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,738
<i>we do need to switch</i>
<i>to renewable energies.</i>

484
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,867
<i>But none of that will alter</i>
<i>the tremendous amount of carbon</i>

485
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,036
<i>we've already put into the atmosphere.</i>

486
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,210
<i>Since 1750,</i>
<i>when the Industrial Revolution began,</i>

487
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,214
<i>we've pumped about 1,000 billion tons,</i>

488
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,133
<i>also known as gigatons,</i>

489
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,803
<i>of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</i>

490
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,141
<i>It's called our legacy load of carbon.</i>

491
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,564
<i>And even if we stopped</i>
<i>all greenhouse gas emissions today,</i>

492
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,234
<i>that legacy load of carbon</i>
<i>will still be there.</i>

493
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,320
<i>That legacy load of carbon dioxide</i>

494
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,739
<i>is still gonna be warming the atmosphere</i>

495
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,284
<i>for decades, if not centuries.</i>

496
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:06,330
<i>So if all we talk about</i>
<i>is reducing emissions,</i>

497
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,582
<i>it's not enough.</i>

498
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,837
<i>If electric cars</i>
<i>and solar panels aren't enough,</i>

499
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,797
<i>then what is the solution?</i>

500
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:20,178
The only goal that makes sense
for humanity is drawdown,

501
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,349
a year-to-year reduction in carbon
in the upper atmosphere.

502
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,936
Anything else is climate chaos.

503
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,690
If we want to achieve drawdown,

504
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,569
we have to go thank the Earth

505
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,741
and start to farm
and grow our plants and trees

506
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,451
in an entirely different way.

507
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:49,373
Once you achieve drawdown,
within 20 years, you have cooling.

508
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,959
You have the beginning of cooling.

509
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:57,298
So, now, we have a horizon
that if you're 20, 30 years old,

510
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,718
you can say,
"In my lifetime, we can achieve this."

511
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,892
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>the very practices that heal our soils</i>

512
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,019
<i>will also heal our climate.</i>

513
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,775
<i>To stabilize Earth's climate,</i>

514
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:19,695
<i>we can use the most powerful</i>
<i>carbon capture technologies:</i>

515
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,826
<i>the photosynthesis of plants</i>
<i>and the microorganisms in the soil.</i>

516
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,247
<i>And the one type of farming</i>
<i>that does this the best</i>

517
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,249
<i>and draws down the most carbon</i>

518
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,836
<i>is based on the concept of regeneration,</i>

519
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,132
<i>which simply means</i>
<i>to repair the damage we've done</i>

520
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,510
<i>and make things better.</i>

521
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,975
So we are sitting in a food forest.

522
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,103
This is agroforestry.

523
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:56,774
It's agriculture through trees,
tree diversification.

524
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,991
I've got an avocado tree,
banana tree, fig tree, coffee trees.

525
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,076
♪ <i>…And put my hands in the dirt…</i> ♪

526
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,746
We went from a lot of crop
of single Hass avocado

527
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,457
to now having
about 40 different fruit varieties onsite.

528
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,377
<i>♪ 'Cause my home is where</i>
<i>My food is grown ♪</i>

529
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,088
<i>♪ I'm goin' back to the earth… ♪</i>

530
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,925
By diversifying, we can now have harvests
every month.

531
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,640
If you're looking to do something
that would greatly impact Mother Earth,

532
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,766
plant a tree.

533
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,687
You don't need acres and acres
and acres to build a food forest.

534
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,856
You really just need
a few hundred square feet.

535
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,277
You're gonna look outside
one day ago and go,

536
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,739
"What is something we buy
every day at the grocery store,

00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,867

to be shipped around the world to me,

538
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,619
what can I put in my own backyard
that I can do myself?"

539
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,582
<i>♪ And to truly be forgiven</i>

543
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,508
<i>Regenerative agriculture</i>
<i>grows more food</i>

544
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,801
<i>per acre.</i>

545
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,554
<i>It's scalable</i>
<i>to our entire agricultural system.</i>

546
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:13,684
<i>And what's more,</i>
<i>it's already being done right now, today.</i>

547
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,484
I'm a rancher.

548
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,778
That's how I prefer to be thought of

549
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,488
is I'm a rancher.

550
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,699
A farmer technically grows crops.

551
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,535
A rancher raises livestock.

552
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,873
Why I like to be considered a rancher
is because…

553
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,877
I'm all about living things
and taking part in living ecosystems.

554
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,672
And, to me, that's what my operation
- a living ecosystem.

555
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,844
We purchased this place in 1991.

556
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,181
And for the first two years,
I was farming conventionally.

557
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:56,018
Heavy, heavy tillage.
High use of synthetics.

558
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,313
1995 came along,

559
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,233
and the day
before I was going to start combining,

560
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,568
I lost 100 percent of our crop
to a hail storm.

561
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,070
So we were totally wiped out.

562
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,407
No income from our crops.

563
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,285
That was really tough to take
'cause we didn't have crop insurance.

564
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,871
1996 came along,

565
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,749
we lost 100 percent
of our crop to hail, again.

566
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,292
1997 came along…

567
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,505
we dried out.

568
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,714
Nobody combined an acre.

569
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,466
There was a major drought in this area.

570
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,054
1998 came along, and we lost
80 percent of our crop to hail.

571
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,433
So we were four years
with basically no crop income.

572
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,604
The neighbors were all taking bets
and waiting for my land.

573
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,690
Times were really
getting tough financially,

574
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,943
and the banker didn't want to loan me
any money to buy inputs.

575
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,903
The best thing that could have happened.

576
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,407
I wasn't gonna fail.

577
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,119
I really had to start focusing,

578
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,289
how can I make this farm and ranch

579
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,500
get these soils to produce a crop
without all these inputs?

580
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:10,384
So I started to be
a studier of soil ecosystems.

581
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,138
I actually went back
and I read Thomas Jefferson's old journals

582
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,516
'cause I was trying to figure out
how did they do this

583
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,852
previous to the use
of all these synthetics.

584
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,693
We have been promoting no till
for many, many years.

585
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,905
No tillage means
you don't till the soil at all.

586
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,656
You just plant directly into it.

587
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,492
This is a no-till drill.

588
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,662
No-till drills are available
everywhere in the world.

589
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,167
This will help you grow topsoil.

590
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,128
Any type of tillage equipment
will destroy topsoil.

591
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,922
This is your firming wheel.

592
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,842
This holds this residue
so the disc here can cut it,

593
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,677
just making a small slit.

594
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:58,724
The seed travels down
at a specific rate per acre.

595
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,309
This comes around,

596
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,771
moves a small amount of soil
right over that seed.

597
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,148
We're keeping all this armor
on the soil surface

598
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:10,110
in order to protect the soil
from wind erosion, water erosion,

599
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,698
so we can grow crops on much less moisture
with this type of a system.

600
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,413
Rain falls on this,
it's going to go right into the soil.

601
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,708
Rain falls on bare soil,
it's going to run off,

602
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,169
and then
it's going to evaporate very quickly.

603
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:33,050
<i>Soil that is not tilled stores more water,</i>

604
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,344
<i>thus increasing microbe growth,</i>

605
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,638
<i>which leads to more plant growth</i>

606
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,683
<i>and even to more local rainfall.</i>

607
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,646
<i>This is the virtuous cycle</i>
<i>of regeneration.</i>

608
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:53,779
<i>Gabe Brown's soil is also pulling</i>
<i>more carbon out of the atmosphere.</i>

609
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,534
<i>For every one percent increase</i>
<i>in organic matter,</i>

610
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:03,080
<i>an acre of soil draws down</i>
<i>ten more tons of carbon.</i>

611
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,249
I mean, that's huge.

612
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,668
We have to reduce tillage.

613
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,212
We gotta grow cover crops.

614
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,881
We have to get a living root all the time.

615
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,677
We can't have these bare periods
with nothing growing on them.

616
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,138
We've gotta start using these principles

617
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,015
to restore the water cycle.

618
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,391
And it is fixable.

619
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:32,693
So I'm taking you to a field here
that is a multi-species cover crop.

620
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,948
The purpose of a cover crop

621
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,535
is to enhance the life
and the function of the soil.

622
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,246
Think of it this way.

623
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,790
If I draw a monoculture on this field,

624
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,502
we'd only be feeding
the soil biology one type of root exudate.

625
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,088
I'm growing 19 species here.

626
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,716
We're accelerating biological time.

627
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,469
We're feeding the soil biology

628
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:02,389
what it would take
a conventional farmer 19 years to do.

629
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,724
I'm doing it in one year.

630
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:09,355
So people might ask,
"How do you get any money from this then?"

631
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,113
Our livestock will graze this
during the winter,

632
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,533
speeding up the process
of regenerating those soils.

633
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,873
Animals grazing living plants

634
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:31,710
are a part of the carbon cycle.

635
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,675
Here in the Northern Plains,

636
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,178
our soils were formed
by large herds of bison and elk

637
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,097
being moved by predators,

638
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,183
grazing a landscape,
trampling that carbon,

639
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,102
the plants, onto the soil surface.

640
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,898
Not coming back for maybe a year.
Allowing full recovery.

641
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,443
<i>It wasn't that long ago</i>

642
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,947
<i>that over 60 million buffalo</i>
<i>roamed the continent.</i>

643
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,663
<i>In an attempt to starve</i>
<i>the Native Americans,</i>

644
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:11,625
<i>the US military and the railroads</i>
<i>killed most of the buffalo.</i>

645
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,254
<i>By the time the culling ended,</i>

646
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:18,799
<i>only a few thousand</i>
<i>of the majestic animals remained.</i>

647
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,473
<i>Where buffalo once roamed,</i>

648
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:32,271
<i>industrial agriculture now grows</i>
<i>hundreds of millions of acres of crops</i>

649
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,857
<i>just to feed animals.</i>

650
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,653
<i>And those animals</i>
<i>are concentrated into feedlots.</i>

651
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:46,952
<i>In turn, feedlots produce</i>
<i>a tremendous amount of greenhouse gases.</i>

652
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,706
A feedlot situation

653
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:54,543
has a positive amount
of greenhouse gases being emitted.

654
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,921
In a grazing situation, the data shows

655
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,591
that we actually get
greenhouse gases sequestered.

656
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,094
So in one situation, you get emissions,

657
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,763
and in the other situation,
you get sequestration.

658
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,225
The problem isn't the animal.

659
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,312
The problem is where the animals are at.

660
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,524
Cows can be good.

661
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,529
That is one
of the most controversial statements…

662
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,825
of mankind at this point.

663
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,664
Using cattle
and allowing them to roam and graze,

664
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:37,211
land grazing,
can literally revive enough space

665
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,213
to create a tremendous amount of drawdown.

666
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,882
I'm from Southeast Louisiana.

667
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,551
I grew up
in an incredibly delicate ecosystem.

668
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:50,807
Conservation was always
a very serious part of my life.

669
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,145
I had no idea
that the Earth was desertifying.

670
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,279
I got on a plane from New York City
to fly to Zimbabwe to meet Allan Savory

671
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,409
so he could show us
the difference between desertification

672
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,162
and regeneration.

673
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:18,627
Land that has been holistically managed
through planned grazing using cattle,

674
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,505
the most vilified animal in the world.

675
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,343
We are in Africa right now
driving through a field

676
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:32,724
that has been under Allan Savory's
holistic management for nine years,

677
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,269
and it is an Eden.

678
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,105
This is what you call high grass.

679
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,694
Using livestock to reverse desertification

680
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:47,656
is totally scalable
to about two-thirds of the world's land,

681
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,866
and nothing else is.

682
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:54,580
And, frankly, that can be done
at extremely low cost.

683
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,171
Here we are.

684
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,549
This is what it should be like.

685
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:09,886
You've been working
on this land for eight or nine years.

686
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,224
It went from a place
of turning into a total desert,

687
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:18,270
and using hooved herding herbivores.

688
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:23,317
You have literally transformed that,
what we've been seeing,

689
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,193
- into this.
- Yeah.

690
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,488
How in the hell do you make this happen?

691
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,915
So the urine and the hooves of the animals

692
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,126
are what caused this grass to grow.

693
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,714
That livestock is never on more
than a hectare of this land,

694
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,007
about 2.5 acres,

695
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,217
- never more than three days.
- Right.

696
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,511
And they're never back
on that piece of land

697
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,347
under about six to nine months.

698
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,183
- Wow.
- So no plant can get overgrazed.

699
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,479
You can come any day of the year,
anywhere on this land,

700
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,148
and you will see no livestock

701
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,443
because they will be
on less than one hectare of land.

702
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,071
And unless we take you there,
you won't even know it.

703
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:18,413
Dealing with this beast of climate change,
a lot of people don't understand

704
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,498
that this…

705
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,918
- helps climate change.
- Yes.

706
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,546
- This sequesters carbon.
- Yeah.

707
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:32,427
This takes the one thing that
we so desperately need out of the air,

708
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,889
and it holds it, and it makes oxygen.

709
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,685
Yeah, if we can produce solid grassland,

710
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,313
you can pull down enormous amounts
of carbon back into the soil.

711
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,567
Two-thirds of the world, roughly,
is grasslands in savannas

712
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:52,072
where the rainfall is too low
to support a solid canopy of trees

713
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,281
giving you soil cover.

714
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:57,160
So grass is essentially
what has to stabilize that soil.

715
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,373
You look at this, and you realize
this is what the world should look like.

716
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,041
This is what Africa should look like.

717
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,502
This is what South
and Central America should look like.

718
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,046
This is what Texas should look like.

719
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,841
This is how we win.

720
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,302
We can get the Earth

721
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,973
back to the garden of Eden
that it once was

722
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,474
by regeneration.

723
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,478
<i>When used smartly,</i>

724
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:28,442
<i>herbivores can pull down carbon</i>
<i>and reverse desertification.</i>

725
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,653
<i>But it doesn't just work for Africa.</i>

726
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,656
<i>It works everywhere in the world.</i>

727
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,302
So it's long pants today, right?
You guys are gonna ride horses?

728
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,428
Yeah.

729
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,138
Okay.

730
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,744
I was raised
in a rural area in Washington,

731
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,331
adopted by a Lakota elder.

732
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:28,210
We were out in nature every day.

733
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:35,383
I found permaculture,
and that was very influential in my life,

734
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:40,180
where I could see that
there could be a permanent agriculture…

735
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:45,101
an agriculture
that not only fed the planet,

736
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:50,232
but also fed the people
in a way that regenerated

737
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,900
and didn't deplete resources.

738
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:58,031
<i>Holistic ranchers,</i>
<i>like the Markegards, use careful planning</i>

739
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:02,661
<i>so their cows sequester carbon</i>
<i>and actually regenerate the land.</i>

740
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,291
So this is our grazing plan
and control chart.

741
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,087
This tells us where we're planning
to have the cattle when.

742
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,467
Hi!

743
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,016
Let's see. It's July 22nd,

744
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,396
so they were in G1,

745
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:35,402
and they are going to move here.

746
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:50,250
All these paddocks correlate
with a map that I have here.

747
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:55,881
So these are all segments of fencing
where the cattle are.

748
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,383
It tells me how big it is.

749
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:03,638
I can record observations, species,
all right in here in the field.

750
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:10,312
We manage over 8,000 acres
throughout the Bay Area,

751
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,106
so we're constantly on the move.

752
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:19,988
I never get bored.

753
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:22,782
I never get bored.

754
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,624
They call cows mobile microbe tanks,

755
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:35,128
you know, because cows
employ microbes in their rumen

756
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,839
to break down the fibers in food.

757
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,758
So when cows poop,

758
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:43,386
that is just like a steaming mound
of microbes dumped onto the land,

759
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,349
and it's-- it-it, you know,
it's a powerful stuff for the land.

760
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,895
So it's been about three months

761
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,648
since the cattle have been
in this pasture.

762
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,364
Did you hear that little pop
when I popped it out?

763
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:07,035
That was all these root hairs popping off.

764
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:12,666
There's just thousands
and thousands of feet of these root hairs

765
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:17,337
that are interconnected
with all of these other bunch grasses

766
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,966
and all of these other species
through their root hairs

767
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,259
and also through the mycorrhiza fungi.

768
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,096
The cattle will come along,

769
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,976
and they'll eat the tops off.

770
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:38,274
What happens
when the grasses get bitten off

771
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,026
is these roots slough off.

772
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,446
And what is that root made out of?

773
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:45,991
Carbon.

774
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,745
We're taking carbon from the atmosphere
via photosynthesis

775
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,372
into the plant,

776
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,126
and then it's going through the plant

777
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,170
into the root system,

778
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:03,133
that carbon, and it sloughs off
and turns into humus…

779
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,553
where it belongs.

780
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:20,900
The form of agriculture that we use

781
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,195
creates billions of lives

782
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,867
in the form of soil microbes,

783
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:33,163
in nematodes, in grassland birds.

784
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:37,250
All of that wildlife is flourishing

785
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,961
under an agriculture system

786
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:45,425
versus a tilled crop field,

787
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,303
which is denude of life.

788
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:56,895
<i>In the vast majority</i>
<i>of those tilled fields grow one thing:</i>

789
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,981
<i>animal feed.</i>

790
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,777
<i>Corn, soy, and hay.</i>

791
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:09,449
<i>These crops and the feedlots</i>
<i>that rely on them exist</i>

792
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,745
<i>only because they are subsidized</i>
<i>by our tax dollars.</i>

793
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:19,292
I was speaking to a group of corn
and soybean producers from Missouri

794
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,293
this past winter.

795
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,503
And the one guy stood up and said,

796
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:24,923
"Why would I want to plant
anything else than corn and beans

797
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:28,093
when I'm guaranteed a profit
before I even go on the field?"

798
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,180
<i>The United States Department</i>
<i>of Agriculture uses something</i>

799
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,974
<i>called the Commodity Credit Corporation</i>

800
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,062
<i>to give farmers price guarantees</i>
<i>for growing specific crops.</i>

801
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,775
<i>In the current system,</i>

802
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:47,403
<i>taxpayers subsidize farmers</i>
<i>to grow the crops</i>

803
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:51,282
<i>that feed the animals</i>
<i>that live in feedlots,</i>

804
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,952
<i>which emit greenhouse gases.</i>

805
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,287
<i>The result?</i>

806
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:02,252
<i>Our land is turning to dust,</i>
<i>and our farmers are going bust.</i>

807
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:06,548
And then I come back and ask them,
now, how much money would you be making

808
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,676
if the government
wasn't subsidizing your operation?

809
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,636
And they know. They know the answer.

810
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,513
They're not gonna be making money.

811
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,682
I dropped off all those programs.

812
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,476
I tell producers
I don't want to be on welfare anymore.

813
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,897
<i>Even with genetically-altered seeds,</i>

814
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,234
<i>chemical sprays, and government subsidies,</i>

815
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:29,946
<i>most farmers struggle</i>
<i>to make a few dollars per acre.</i>

816
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,782
<i>But on its 5,000 acres,</i>

817
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:38,371
<i>Brown's ranch generates</i>
<i>over $100 profit per acre per year.</i>

818
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:45,086
If you build a healthy farm ecosystem,
you're going to be resilient.

819
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,629
You're going to take the risk out of it.

820
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:50,383
Yes, I grow corn.
I don't grow soybeans, but I grow peas.

821
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,552
That's good.

822
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,263
But I also grow wheat,
and barley, and oats, vetch,

823
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,558
and triticale, and alfalfa,
grass-finished beef, lamb, pork,

824
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,478
honey, vegetables,
all these other products.

825
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,272
I could care less
what the price of corn or beans are

826
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:07,233
because they're such
a small fraction of my operation.

827
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,695
I built resiliency into the ecosystem.

828
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,701
Most of the land that's managed by farmers

829
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,953
is owned by somebody
other than the farmer.

830
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,332
We believe landowners,

831
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,919
as they come to understand
the long-term benefits

832
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,462
of managing for soil health,

833
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:31,007
will encourage their farmers
to prioritize this.

834
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,553
Once a farmer starts to manage
for soil health

835
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,847
and see those economic benefits,

836
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,098
they won't turn back.

837
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,311
<i>By switching to regenerative agriculture,</i>

838
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:46,397
<i>American farmers</i>
<i>could increase their profits</i>

839
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:50,360
<i>by over 100 billion dollars annually,</i>

840
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,154
<i>and virtually eliminate their subsidies.</i>

841
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,865
You know,
we have a motto on our operation.

842
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,743
We want to sign
the back of the check and not the front.

843
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,913
It's a pretty good motto.
It leaves a lot more in your pocket.

844
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,458
The federal farm program we have today

845
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,963
is the most detrimental thing there is
to regenerative agriculture.

846
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,468
<i>In order for our governments</i>
<i>to support the shift to regeneration,</i>

847
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,596
<i>the people may have to lead the way.</i>

848
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,892
<i>And the odds are</i>
<i>there are some things that you can do</i>

849
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,187
<i>to save our soils today.</i>

850
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,732
This is everybody's life
every hour of the day almost.

851
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,900
Food waste.

852
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,695
Yeah, food waste is ubiquitous.
Everybody does it.

853
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,575
<i>Well, not everybody does it.</i>

854
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:59,220
There are continents and other really
large regions that are getting hit

855
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:03,391
with a double whammy
of higher temperatures and drought.

856
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,352
This kills soil. It kills life.

857
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,149
One of the solutions to that challenge

858
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:15,445
is to collect the food scraps
from cities, like San Francisco,

859
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:19,157
turn them into compost,
and get it onto local farms.

860
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:24,287
And that helps them retain water
because compost is a natural sponge.

861
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:32,045
The unfortunate reality is
most trash or garbage gets incinerated

862
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,463
or sent to a landfill.

863
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,465
We need to model nature.

864
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,092
I had the good fortune of being mayor

865
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,220
when we brought the United Nations
World Environment Day into our city.

866
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:45,767
We made it a week-long celebration
of the environment and a call to action.

867
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,647
And one of the specific strategies
was reducing waste.

868
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:56,235
<i>San Francisco residents are actually fined</i>

869
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,697
<i>for not putting compost</i>
<i>into the green bin.</i>

870
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:03,576
<i>We incentivize people</i>
<i>to keep things out of the black bins.</i>

871
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,662
<i>When you have nothing</i>
<i>in a black bin, we don't charge you.</i>

872
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,456
<i>When you have a ton of stuff</i>
<i>in the black bin, we charge you a lot.</i>

873
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:11,250
<i>So your goal</i>
<i>is to get it in the green and blue bins,</i>

874
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,294
<i>the composting and the recycling bins.</i>

875
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,756
<i>You want to move the mouse,</i>
<i>gotta move the cheese.</i>

876
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,343
In San Francisco,

877
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:23,846
we're collecting 700 tons of food scraps

878
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,641
and plant cuttings per day.

879
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,861
It's 5:00 in the morning…

880
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,322
and we're making compost.

881
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,577
This is the most important kind
of garbage that there is

882
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:50,873
because this is where the nutrients are,
and this is where the carbon is.

883
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,626
The compost arrives,

884
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,671
the food scraps from the restaurants
and people's homes,

885
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,465
and we put them in this sorting system.

886
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,512
Sixty days ago,

887
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,098
this was egg shells, and chicken bones,

888
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,434
and vegetable peelings.

889
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:13,521
And, now,
it's a beautiful finished compost.

890
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:16,315
And I'm digging in,
and it's quite warm here.

891
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,943
It's still composting very actively.

892
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,197
We collect our food scraps.
We put them in the green bin.

893
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,742
It goes off
to Recology's compost facility.

894
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,161
We turn it into compost,
and it gets on a farm.

895
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,372
That's a simple solution.

896
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,002
San Francisco became
the most sustainable big city

897
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:39,255
in the United States of America
in just a few short years,

898
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,882
and we grew our economy.

899
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,344
And if San Francisco can prove an ideal,

900
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,391
then that success can be replicated
in other cities, in other states,

901
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,059
and other nations
around the rest of the world.

902
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:03,237
Compost is the natural decomposition
of organic matter in nature.

903
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,282
In a forest floor,
it's when the leaves drop,

904
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,075
the fungi and bacteria take it over

905
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,994
and literally build the soil
at the root zone.

906
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,331
Compost is all about community,

907
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:16,250
from the community of microbes
that are breaking down the pile,

908
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,419
to the community of individuals
in Los Angeles

909
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:22,673
that are physically turning and sifting
and contributing to that pile.

910
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:30,056
I collect food scraps
from restaurants, manure from zoos.

911
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,891
Manure. Do you know why?

912
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:36,687
To keep this stuff out of landfills
and use it to make good, rich dirt.

913
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,605
That's why.

914
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,984
How do we take waste
and repurpose and reuse it?

915
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,820
Because it's really not waste.

916
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,198
My name is Pashon. It's Pashon Murray.

917
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:52,078
So that was my destiny,
to be passionate about the environment.

918
01:03:56,749 --> 01:04:00,461
When we went to Haiti
to run this compost sanitation pilot…

919
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,506
everybody kind of thought I was crazy.

920
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,550
And maybe I am.

921
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,426
- I'm Steven. Yeah.
- And you're the…?

922
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,345
- The man.
- And I'm the woman.

923
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:13,099
- Yeah. We are the men around, man.
- Yeah.

924
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,309
Well Haiti happened, obviously,

925
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,603
this earthquake
that was just so devastating.

926
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,982
We all felt like
we wanted to do something.

927
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,942
And Patricia, she's a problem solver.

928
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:27,947
As soon as she got there, she was like,
"Okay, they have a sanitation problem."

929
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,658
The water under the soil
was getting contaminated.

930
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:36,038
<i>2.5 billion people</i>
<i>don't have sanitation around the world,</i>

931
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,916
<i>and that means people can get diseases.</i>

932
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:45,631
<i>So we train people around the world</i>
<i>to have composting toilets</i>

933
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,217
<i>so they can learn how to collect</i>
<i>and treat their own waste</i>

934
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,552
<i>for their community.</i>

935
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:54,056
The most noticeable change
that we saw was the smell.

936
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,476
The experience of living around
the latrines was night and day.

937
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,270
We're in front of this compost pile.

938
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:02,982
- Do you guys smell anything bad here?
- No.

939
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:08,237
Part of the strength of this
system is that it's very easy to learn.

940
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,991
You don't have to order some part
or component.

941
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:15,161
People can learn
how to do this everywhere.

942
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:19,582
So here is the spare container.
Here is the sawdust available.

943
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:22,543
What I love about thermophilic composting

944
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,713
is that it helps address
multiple climate change issues.

945
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,966
It helps us protect water resources.

946
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,010
Treating it
and getting rid of all the pathogens,

947
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,012
and ending up with compost.

948
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,933
And when it's finished,
it will be like beautiful dirt.

949
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:41,103
You can then amend the soil
and have more crop growth.

950
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,774
The only problem with it
is that people are hung up on the fact

951
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,400
that it's human feces.

952
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,070
We just, in general, as humans,
have a poo phobia.

953
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,659
But what most people don't know
is that all across America,

954
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:58,663
if you buy some potting mix,
it probably has biosolids in it,

955
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,998
and that comes from human sewage.

956
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,919
We eat food. We poop it out.

957
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:09,090
We can then treat it and create soil

958
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:12,176
that has good content for the plants,

959
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,804
and then the circle
just goes around and around.

960
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,265
The poop has to stay in the loop.

961
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,018
This is a very nice toilet,

962
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,313
and I would love to go
to the bathroom in your toilet.

963
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,731
Excuse me, please.

964
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:34,156
<i>Compost is just one of a suite</i>
<i>of soil-based carbon capture solutions.</i>

965
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:39,537
<i>The more we choose regenerative foods,</i>
<i>the more that farmers will grow them.</i>

966
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:43,958
We're at a critical moment
in human history.

967
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:50,923
There could be a way
to eat food that heals the planet.

968
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:58,889
The way we're articulating it
is the regenerative diet.

969
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,145
I've personally been vegan for 20 years.

970
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:07,481
I've just kind of proven in my own world,
like, hey, you can rock life in a…

971
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,775
very healthy, strong,
and powerful fashion

972
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,444
on a plant-based diet.

973
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:18,868
If you're eating meat, if you can eat it
from a lot more correct high-level farms.

974
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:21,620
If we do eat meat,

975
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:26,167
we need to eat meat
that comes from pasture-raised,

976
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,253
grass-fed, humanely-killed animals.

977
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,840
This is the most crucial choice
all of us can make

978
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:34,383
for the future of the planet.

979
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:35,509
What are we eating?

980
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,137
What kind of farming systems
are we supporting?

981
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,431
Are we regenerating the Earth,
or are we degenerating?

982
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,979
So what we have here
are two of our egg-mobiles.

983
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:52,359
Approximately three days after the cattle
move through an area and graze,

984
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,695
we'll bring the land hens in.

985
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,072
They truly are free range.

986
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,908
They could walk to California
if they so choose.

987
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:03,079
What we did here
is we went to the local grocer,

988
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:06,123
and we bought a dozen cage-free,

989
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,627
all-natural, humanely-raised eggs.

990
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:12,129
We'll reach in there
and crack one of those open.

991
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:17,802
Now, what we have here
is one from our pastured land hens.

992
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,139
Ours on the left is much darker colored.

993
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,390
Now, watch this.

994
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,394
See how that breaks open rather easily?

995
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,021
It's runny.

996
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,232
Now, look at this.

997
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:36,487
I can poke my finger into there
several times before we finally break it.

998
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:40,157
Now, look at the color of that yolk
and look at the difference.

999
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:46,956
Ours are out on pasture.
They eat whatever they can forage for.

1000
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:49,708
These, although they're cage-free,

1001
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:53,963
they are no doubt in confinement,
and they're fed mostly grain.

1002
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:58,217
Ours are going to be much higher
in nutrient density

1003
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,510
as compared to these.

1004
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,388
And what you're really feeling there

1005
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:07,268
is the nutrients and the complexity
of regenerative agriculture.

1006
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:11,814
<i>Eating a regenerative diet is important,</i>

1007
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:15,359
<i>but so is working with the people</i>
<i>who grow our food.</i>

1008
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,948
<i>Today, we estimate</i>
<i>five percent or less of farms</i>

1009
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,825
<i>are managed for soil health.</i>

1010
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:28,080
<i>The Nature Conservancy has partnered</i>
<i>with the National Corn Growers Association</i>

1011
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,332
<i>to establish the Soil Health Partnership.</i>

1012
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:37,089
<i>Our goal is to grow this to 50 percent</i>
<i>of US farms managed for soil health</i>

1013
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,299
<i>by 2025.</i>

1014
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:42,428
This idea of the Soil Health Academy

1015
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,638
started about five years ago

1016
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:49,476
when Ray first stepped onto my ranch
and we first met.

1017
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:53,522
Little did we know
what would become of that plan

1018
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,983
to try and move regeneration forward.

1019
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,694
It's finally come to fruition.

1020
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,487
- Ray Archuleta.
- Jesse.

1021
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:01,864
Hi, Jesse. Good to see you.

1022
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,368
Let me-- let me start off with myself.
My name is, uh, Ray Archuleta.

1023
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,704
I have 32 years of government service.

1024
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:13,125
Our goal was to make the soil healthy
to teach more these ecological principles.

1025
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:19,423
We wanted to…
to mentor, to inspire people

1026
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,051
that they're part of the planet,

1027
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:25,596
and that we're gonna have
a better relationship with it.

1028
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,642
Used to be
you'd pick up a farm magazine,

1029
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:32,019
and there wasn't a single article
about soil health.

1030
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,812
Now, you cannot pick one up

1031
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,649
without there bein' some article
about soil health.

1032
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,067
That gives me hope.

1033
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,404
We can improve soil health
much, much faster

1034
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,156
than we used to think possible.

1035
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,367
Sometimes, when I give presentations,

1036
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:51,121
I get this group that's just, no way.
It won't happen here. Can't happen here.

1037
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,040
So I offer them this challenge.

1038
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:55,376
I said, "I will bet my ranch against yours

1039
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,211
that I can get it to work
on your operation."

1040
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:01,257
Because the principles of soil health,

1041
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,135
the least amount
of mechanical disturbance, diversity,

1042
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:09,431
armor on the soil, living root
at all times, animal integration…

1043
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,684
Those principles are universal.

1044
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:14,937
There is zero doubt,
and I mean zero doubt in my mind

1045
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,940
I can get these practices to work
anywhere in the world.

1046
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,991
If you look over here,
we have my neighbor's land

1047
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,368
that has been chemical fallowed.

1048
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,830
It has had nothing growing on it
for over a year

1049
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:36,250
except for the few
Roundup-resistant weeds that are on here.

1050
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,752
It's an ecological desert.

1051
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,796
Then you look over at our paddocks,

1052
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:44,258
you have a diversity
of different plant species.

1053
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,301
You have insects.

1054
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:48,345
You have wildlife,
plus the livestock grazing on it.

1055
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:53,517
We're capturing sunlight from early
in the spring till late in the fall,

1056
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,603
converting that sunlight
into liquid carbon

1057
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,522
to drive and fuel the system.

1058
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,776
There you have soil.
Over on this side, you have dirt.

1059
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,991
Where do you want your food to come from?

1060
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:12,328
Which model do you want
your food to be produced from?

1061
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,289
The answer is pretty simple to me.

1062
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,923
<i>All over our planet,</i>

1063
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:29,595
<i>people are using the practices</i>
<i>of regeneration to heal the land</i>

1064
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,180
<i>and balance the climate.</i>

1065
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:34,892
<i>Some of these projects are big.</i>

1066
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:40,147
We know that about 25 percent
of the world's landmass

1067
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:43,150
has been degraded
by human beings over historical time.

1068
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,740
When we look
at the cradles of civilization,

1069
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:52,534
Greece and Rome,

1070
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:55,913
we find that many of these places
have turned into deserts.

1071
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:02,419
The sand is blowing across the ruins
of once-great civilizations.

1072
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:08,217
Loess Plateau,
the cradle of Chinese civilization.

1073
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:12,304
That was the place
where settled agriculture first began.

1074
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:17,017
When I was asked to film
the baseline study in the Loess Plateau,

1075
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,687
I found myself alone
standing on a mountain top,

1076
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:24,358
and I could look in 360 degrees,
and there was no vegetation.

1077
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:32,324
This was fundamentally,
ecologically destroyed.

1078
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,744
It was called
"the most eroded place on Earth,"

1079
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,580
filled with miserably poor people.

1080
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:45,546
So I felt that I had to spend
the rest of my life dealing with this.

1081
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:54,346
It was hard to imagine,
at that time, that you could restore that.

1082
01:13:56,140 --> 01:14:02,020
So from about 1994 till 2009, 14 years,

1083
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,149
an area of 35,000 square kilometers,

1084
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,359
approximately the size of Belgium,

1085
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,195
they had the top Chinese scientists,

1086
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,449
they had international scientists
from the World Bank supporting them…

1087
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:16,410
They created mapping systems
with satellites

1088
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:21,582
so that every watershed
had a unique address.

1089
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:23,500
The results were…

1090
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:26,253
stunning.

1091
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,655
Hundreds of millions of people
were lifted out of poverty.

1092
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,284
We met people who were illiterate,

1093
01:14:57,367 --> 01:15:01,955
and their children now go
to the top universities in the country.

1094
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,965
Human beings emerged in paradise.

1095
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:15,344
If we restore
all the degraded land on the Earth,

1096
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,346
we can return to paradise.

1097
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:22,267
If we start now
to build a restoration economy,

1098
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,102
a regeneration economy,

1099
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,396
this is the way forward.

1100
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:31,276
To see a stream return and flow

1101
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,862
to bring back fertile soils,

1102
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:38,075
to see biodiversity return to a place
that was completely devastated,

1103
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:42,746
this is where everyone can find
tremendous satisfaction.

1104
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:49,878
<i>♪ When I look into your eyes ♪</i>

1105
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:55,175
<i>♪ It's like watchin' the night sky ♪</i>

1106

1108
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:13,151
So let's restore
a little bit of paradise every day.

1109
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:15,821
It's not that difficult.

1110
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,659
If we stop distracting ourselves
with shiny objects,

1111
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:23,662
and we start to think
about what's really important to us,

1112
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:28,208
to see biodiversity returned
to a place it was completely devastated…

1113
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:35,048
This is where everyone
can find tremendous satisfaction

1114
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:37,884
and the meaning of our lives.

1115
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,765
We're all in this together.

1116
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:48,020
Every action that we take
affects every other action

1117
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,147
like a ripple in the pond.

1118
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:54,610
So what decision are you gonna make

1119
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:58,655
that will make a positive impact
on this beautiful planet

1120
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:02,993
so that our great grandchildren,
seven generations in the future,

1121
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:06,788
can actually go up
and hug an old growth redwood tree,

1122
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:10,459
and swim in clean waters,

1123
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:15,380
and be able to open their mouths
and drink while they're swimming?

1124
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,596
And what is it that we can do today

1125
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:27,100
so that our children
can flourish in the abundance

1126
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,936
that we've created by our decisions?

1127
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:38,570
I will drive 100 miles,
1,000 miles if we have to,

1128
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,740
to save one farm.

1129
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,867
To open one heart and one mind.

1130
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,996
It's that one mind that you change.

1131
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,750
You don't know if it'll affect
another mind, another heart.

1132
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,002
It's what happened to us.

1133
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,963
It changed our hearts,
and it changed our lives.

1134
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:02,135
No, it's not about religion.
It's not about politics.

1135
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,012
It's about love.

1136
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,515
And if you love something
or you love somebody,

1137
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:07,724
you want to understand them,

1138
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,060
and you want to, like,
take care of them and protect them

1139
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,354
and keep them safe.

1140
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,981
And that's what we're all here to do.

1141
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:21,071
Even like the little mycorrhiza fungi,
and the worms, and the bacteria.

1142
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,700
And if we take care of them,
they'll take care of us.

1143
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:31,289
