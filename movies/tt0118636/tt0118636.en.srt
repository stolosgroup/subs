2
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:47,219
<i>And still, the questions remain.</i>

3
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:52,192
<i>Was it economic, was it social
or was it cultural?</i>

4
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,196
<i>Or was it simply a matter of human nature?</i>

5
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,028
<i>What was it that made
some people do what they did...</i>

6
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,034
<i>and other people do nothing at all?</i>

7
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:03,169
Good job, Mr. Bowden.

8
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:05,968
It's nice to see a few more A's
this time around...

9
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,975
including Mr. Bowden's, of course.

10
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,715
This concludes our week on the Holocaust.

11
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:24,822
If you wanna know more,
you may find the Santo Donato library...

12
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:26,952
to be an excellent resource.

13
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:40,447
<i>- Guess who likes you.
- Who?</i>

14
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:43,609
<i>Becky Trask.
Are you gonna ask her out?</i>

15
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:47,644
- You know who I'm talkin' about?
- I know who she is.

16
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,782
- I'll think about it.
- No, don't think.

17
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,053
You just do it, all right?

18
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:55,858
And can you give me your trig notes
from last year, because Fiscarelii...

19
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:59,367
- I knew this was leading to something.
- Fiscarelii is kickin' my ass.

20
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:02,460
- I'll bring them in tomorrow.
- Cool. Ask Becky out.

21
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:05,529
- I gotta think about it.
- What are you doin' after school?

22
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:07,541
I'm busy.

23
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,206
All right, I'm coming!

24
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:51,412
Oh, for God's sake.

25
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,910
Yes?

26
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:06,054
- What do you want?
- I...

27
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:10,654
If you're selling something,
I'm not interested.

28
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,893
I have your newspaper.

29
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,102
I'm not...
I'm not selling anything.

30
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:22,268
Then what do you want?

31
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:24,812
If you could let me in,
I just wanna talk.

32
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:28,074
Talk?

33
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,517
I don't have anything to say to you, boy.
Good day to you.

34
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:35,955
Bergen-Belsen,
January of '43 to June '43.

35
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:40,085
Auschwitz,
June '43 to June '44.

36
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:42,756
And then you went to Patin.

37
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:45,299
After that, you disappeared.

38
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:48,803
But then in 1965,
you were spotted in West Berlin.

39
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,373
Listen, boy.

40
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,840
I don't have time for this game.

41
00:08:56,912 --> 00:09:01,372
- Now leave before I call the police.
- Call them if you want.

42
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,645
I'm sure they'd love to meet you.

43
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:08,851
Who are you?

44
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,358
My name's Todd Bowden.

45
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:15,226
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just really wanna talk to you.

46
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:18,733
If you could let me in for a minute?

47
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,395
Please, Mr. Dussander?

48
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,072
All of this...

49
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:30,305
because you saw an old man
with a raincoat and an umbrella?

50
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:34,212
It wasn't that easy. I mean,
these pictures are 40 years old, at least.

51
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,877
But when I held 'em up next to the ones I took,
I knew I was close.

52
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,855
- You took photographs of me?
- Yeah.

53
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:44,687
But even then, I couldn't be sure.

54
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,093
I needed real proof,
so I dusted your mailbox for fingerprints.

55
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:52,395
You know, that's a lot harder
than people think.

56
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:56,130
I had to go back to Toytown three times
to get all the stuff.

57
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,138
Then I waited till you were at the movies.

58
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:01,835
You put dust on my mailbox for fingerprints?

59
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,845
You took photographs of me?
What else did you do?

60
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,142
I already had a copy
of your fingerprints.

61
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:10,446
They're on your want sheet
from the Israeli government.

62
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,510
It's all on database at U.C. Irvine.

63
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:18,749
Are you okay?

64
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:23,496
Would you care for a drink, boy?

65
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:25,863
- How about milk?
- Milk.

66
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:40,039
You told your parents about all this then?

67
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,049
You think I'm crazy?

68
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:47,518
It takes eight good matches
for a print to get accepted in court.

69
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:49,147
They're called compares.

70
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:53,422
One or two is not so hard to find,
but eight good ones, that's really tough.

71
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:57,056
It all sounds very exciting, boy...

72
00:10:57,132 --> 00:11:00,761
but I'm afraid all your work
has been for nothing.

73
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:02,564
I found 14 compares.

74
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:10,471
Boy, what you have done...

75
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:15,005
I have to explain this to you because,
clearly, you don't understand.

76
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,109
What you have done is a violation.

77
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:20,120
Like those experiments
with the decompression chamber.

78
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:23,646
- Now, that's a violation.
- To hell with this and to hell with you.

79
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,659
I'm calling the police.

80
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,458
Your father will beat your behind
when he picks you up from the police station.

81
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:32,989
- My parents don't believe in violence.
- They should start. I'm calling.

82
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:46,280
My name is Denker.

83
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:52,419
Arthur Denker.

84
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,523
I'm an American.

85
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:01,224
I became a citizen in 1955.

86
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:06,900
I vote.

87
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:14,870
You've no right to come here
and say these lies about me.

88
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,847
I have your fingerprints.

89
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:23,477
I have your photographs.

90
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:26,179
One way or another,
I'll get them to the right people.

91
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,324
This is unforgivable.

92
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:44,834
What do you want?
Tell me.

93
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:50,772
- I wanna hear about it.
- Hear about what?

94
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:53,279
The stories.

95
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:54,781
Everything.

96
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,579
What "everything"?

97
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,281
Everything they're afraid
to show us in school.

98
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:04,524
You were there.

99
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:07,060
You did those things.

100
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:10,427
No one can tell it better than you can.

101
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,432
That's all I want.

102
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,798
Then I'll leave you alone.

103
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:17,269
And just so you know...

104
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,235
everything I have on you...

105
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:27,577
the compares, the want sheet,
all the photographs...

106
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,844
are all in a very safe place.

107
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:33,251
If anything happens to me,
someone will find it. Believe me.

108
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,824
Tell me, boy...

109
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:41,384
why should I consider any of this?

110
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:44,455
Because you hung up the phone, that's why.

111
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:10,652
Judging by the results of your first exam...

112
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:16,095
I think that for most of you,
we moved a little too fast through chapter one.

113
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:19,562
By a show of hands...

114
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:23,468
how many of you think you know
what sociology is?

115
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:28,699
That's what I thought.

116
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:31,712
All right, class.
Let's turn to chapter two.

117
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,717
<i>Once they were in the chamber,
how long did it take?</i>

118
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,315
<i>Five minutes?</i>

119
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:47,955
<i>God, no.
The prussic acid...</i>

120
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,156
took about l5 minutes.

121
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,392
But the monoxide...

122
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:56,028
could take an hour, sometimes more.

123
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:59,738
What happened to them?
I mean, exactly.

124
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:07,173
It was a mess.

125
00:15:07,248 --> 00:15:09,648
They would lose control of their bodies.

126
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:15,087
They vomited, urinated
and defecated themselves.

127
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:19,752
Even though the gas came in
from the vents in the ceiling...

128
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:22,319
they would climb on top of each other...

129
00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:26,766
desperately reaching for fresh air
that wasn't there.

130
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:31,038
They died in a mountain of themselves.

131
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:34,833
What about the children?

132
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,904
On the bottom.

133
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:44,183
Did anyone ever survive it?

134
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,591
One time...

135
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:56,886
the gas didn't work.

136
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:59,058
There was a leak in the pipes...

137
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:02,899
so oxygen mixed with the monoxide.

138
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,432
It was horrible.

139
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:10,274
But after an hour they were still moving...

140
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,644
stumbling around the room like drunks...

141
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:15,649
their eyes glassy.

142
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,947
What did you do?

143
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:24,619
I ordered more gas,
but we didn't know about the leak.

144
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,526
Soon they began to twitch all over...

145
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:30,530
like they were dancing.

146
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,964
Some even fell to their knees...

147
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:37,630
laughing this terrible high-pitched squeal.

148
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:41,632
Even the guards were frightened.

149
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,980
It didn't kill them.

150
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,141
After two hours...

151
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,243
I sent five men in with rifles.

152
00:16:57,258 --> 00:17:00,056
It's getting dark.
Your mother will be worried.

153
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:03,530
Oh, shit! I gotta go.

154
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:06,795
I can be here tomorrow by 3:15.
I want to hear the end of this.

155
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,802
The end?

156
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:14,941
The end.

157
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:13,457
<i>Todd?</i>

158
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:15,001
Are you up?

159
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:17,537
<i>Honey, let's go.
Joey's outside.</i>

160
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:20,073
<i>Tell him I'm comin', will you?</i>

161
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,075
You said you were up half an hour ago.

162
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,707
Yeah, I must have fallen back asleep.

163
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:31,752
<i>Listen, honey,
I'm gonna see a client tonight at 7:00.</i>

164
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,344
But I've got some cold chicken
in the fridge and plenty of...

165
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:37,619
It's okay. I'm gonna eat over
at Mr. Denker's house.

166
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:41,621
What are you gonna do all night?
Watch TV?

167
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:44,927
Mom, I told you. He doesn't watch TV.
I read books to him.

168
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,830
<i>Will you not worry about it?</i>

169
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:49,392
Listen to me.
I want you to invite him over here...

170
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,564
<i>because Daddy and I
still want to meet him.</i>

171
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,801
<i>Okay?</i>

172
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,810
<i>So the policeman said to me...</i>

173
00:18:56,878 --> 00:19:01,713
"Mr. Denker, if you can't see the road,
you shouldn't be driving.

174
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:05,048
Now, how many fingers am I holding up?"

175
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,212
And I said,
"Well now, officer.

176
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,654
Let me guess.

177
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:11,157
One?"

178
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,063
That was the end of my driving in America.

179
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,593
I've taken the bus ever since.

180
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:25,071
Well, of course,
I'm not drivin' much either with this wheelchair...

181
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:28,108
but my eyesight is not what it used to be.

182
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:32,142
That's a whitetail buck.

183
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:36,783
That's a remnant
from our life in Carolina.

184
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:39,251
Dick brought that down
in the Yadkin River...

185
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,550
- seven or eight years ago.
- Seven.

186
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:45,581
You know, your grandson never told me
that he came from a family of hunters.

187
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,652
Oh, Todd never took a shine to guns.

188
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,598
- He's good at other things.
- Baseball is Todd's game.

189
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,659
- Arthur, sure you don't want a cigar?
- No, thank you.

190
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:59,696
If you don't mind, I'll have one of my cigarettes.
Where are they?

191
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:02,709
Ah! Let me help you with that, Arthur.

192
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:04,677
My dear...

193
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:08,375
your generosity humbles me.

194
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:12,044
I thank you for a most enchanting evening.

195
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,654
Well.

196
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,052
I wonder if you'd mind
if I asked you a personal question?

197
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:21,959
Not at all.

198
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:24,691
What'd you do during the war?

199
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:34,465
I was in the reserves,
as were most young men, Victor.

200
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:38,706
But then, my poor eyesight
kept me out of combat, I thank God.

201
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,614
No, I spent most of the war
in the military hospital...

202
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:46,141
washing bed linens and nurses' uniforms.

203
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:52,188
You've been pretty quiet tonight.

204
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:57,526
I'm sorry. It's just that I've heard
all of these stories before.

205
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,295
That's all right, my dear.
The boy's just being honest.

206
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,200
It's a privilege of boys.

207
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:09,573
A privilege that men must sometimes give up.

208
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,707
You know, that reminds me. I...

209
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:19,514
It must have been my first year
at the university.

210
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:23,489
There was a group of about three
or four of us, and we dropped in and...

211
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:28,461
<i>At first my men took turns shooting them in the head,
but there were so many.</i>

212
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,124
<i>Two or three bodies could be packed into each oven.</i>

213
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,692
<i>They were ground into fine ash.</i>

214
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,900
<i>A whole town was wiped off
the face of the earth.</i>

215
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,956
<i>And still, it wasn't enough for Himmler.</i>

216
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,753
<i>That was a dark year.</i>

217
00:21:58,826 --> 00:22:03,854
<i>We ordered every Jew in Kiev
to come to the Babi Yar Ravine.</i>

218
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:08,925
<i>You must remember, boy,
the '20s were a desperate time in Germany.</i>

219
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:11,665
<i>The Treaty of Versailles had left us crippled.</i>

220
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:14,299
<i>God, we must have...
They would hide...</i>

221
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:18,903
<i>The shooting... The walls... The sewers...
But we always found them.</i>

222
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,916
<i>If the dogs didn't,
the smoke and fire would.</i>

223
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:27,387
<i>We would round them up
and march them out to a large pit.</i>

224
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:30,083
<i>At the time,
the shooting was no longer killing.</i>

225
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:35,026
<i>Nothing could stop the killing.
It was no longer death.</i>

226
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:39,590
I will never forget the sound that night.

227
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:43,728
So many of them on top of each other like that.

228
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:47,331
After a few hours, they began to settle.

229
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,113
A head would fall.

230
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:58,640
Yeah, an arm would drop.

231
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:06,793
It was a bit like
the sound of blowing leaves.

232
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:13,231
What did it feel like?

233
00:23:26,747 --> 00:23:28,681
It was something that had to be done.

234
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:32,480
A door had been opened and couldn't be shut.

235
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:34,487
It was the end...

236
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,083
You don't understand.

237
00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:43,588
<i>You've done it a million times!
Let's go!</i>

238
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:06,484
That's it!
Hit the showers!

239
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:11,915
- So, where you been?
- What do you mean?

240
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,018
Well, if you'd return your phone calls...

241
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:17,826
you'd know that Damon's havin' a party
on Saturday night.

242
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:22,562
- I've been busy.
- Too busy for your best friend?

243
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:25,366
I've been studying a lot, okay?
I'm sorry.

244
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:29,570
You gonna go?

245
00:24:29,643 --> 00:24:32,077
I don't even know
if I can get the car or not.

246
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:35,604
- I know someone who'll give you a ride.
- Who?

247
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:28,423
<i>I've been accepted!</i>

248
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:34,361
<i>The Rifzy Vista Country Club.
Hee-hee-hee, my life's ambition.</i>

249
00:26:34,435 --> 00:26:37,495
<i>Officer, can you tell me
where to catch the bus...</i>

250
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:39,505
<i>to the Rifzy Vista Country Club?</i>

251
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:42,269
<i>Rifzy Vista Country Club.
Here it is.</i>

252
00:26:42,343 --> 00:26:44,277
<i>Where you goin', pop?</i>

253
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:47,178
<i>Why, this is the bus to the country club,
isn't it?</i>

254
00:26:47,248 --> 00:26:49,182
<i>Very humorous.</i>

255
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,242
<i>- What do you want?
- The name is Magoo.</i>

256
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,287
<i>I have my papers.</i>

257
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:56,789
- Hello?
<i>- Judge Stevens put me in.</i>

258
00:26:56,857 --> 00:26:59,451
<i>- Okay, sit down.
- Thank you.</i>

259
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:11,033
<i>- This way, buddy.
- My, what an impressive entrance.</i>

260
00:27:11,105 --> 00:27:13,198
<i>Just look at those big iron gates.</i>

261
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:15,367
- Wake up.
- I'll kill you!

262
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:22,982
I thought you were dead.

263
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,180
- You look terrible.
- Today is, uh, Saturday.

264
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:31,020
Since when do you come here on Saturdays?

265
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:33,184
I brought you something.

266
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:38,095
Aren't you gonna open it?
Wait, wait.

267
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:40,656
Let's put the shades down.

268
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:43,736
What for?

269
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:45,738
To be safe.

270
00:27:45,806 --> 00:27:48,969
To hell with this.
You open it.

271
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:51,409
Relax. Open it.

272
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:04,550
You wrapped it yourself, I see.

273
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,777
Merry Christmas.

274
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:25,971
Mary, Mother of God.

275
00:28:27,615 --> 00:28:30,948
- Where did you get this?
- It looks pretty real, huh?

276
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,058
"E. F. Montgomery...

277
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:41,219
Costume Clothiers...

278
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:44,264
Topenstein, New Jersey."

279
00:28:47,134 --> 00:28:48,692
Well, try it on.

280
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,397
Have you completely lost your mind?

281
00:28:51,472 --> 00:28:54,635
What on earth makes you think
I'd put something like that on?

282
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,141
I thought you would like it.

283
00:28:57,578 --> 00:28:58,636
Like it?

284
00:28:58,712 --> 00:29:01,306
You are a bigger fool than I thought.

285
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:04,215
Maybe I'll put it on
and do a little shopping.

286
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,981
Is that what you thought?

287
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:09,648
The indignities I've suffered with you.
I should smash you.

288
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:12,191
What you've suffered with me
is nothing compared...

289
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:15,092
to what the Israelis would do to you.

290
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:18,154
You forget that,
and I'll admit that's my fault.

291
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:20,427
But don't ever forget
the file I have on you.

292
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:23,368
I tried to do things the nice way,
but you don't want it.

293
00:29:23,437 --> 00:29:25,029
So we're gonna do it the hard way.

294
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:28,040
You'll put this on
because I wanna see you in it.

295
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:29,541
Now, move!

296
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,955
I see I've been promoted.

297
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,617
Yeah, I know.
It's all they had.

298
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,593
But that's a perfect fit.
I checked in one of your suit coats.

299
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:24,790
- It itches like hell.
- Quiet.

300
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:29,601
Put the hat on.

301
00:30:30,237 --> 00:30:31,795
Please.

302
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,568
- Please, put the hat on.
- Good God.

303
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:05,634
Attention.

304
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:17,115
What's so funny?

305
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,551
March.

306
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:24,120
Do it.

307
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,025
I'm serious.

308
00:31:35,803 --> 00:31:38,294
Stop fucking around! March!

309
00:31:43,911 --> 00:31:45,173
That's it.

310
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,642
Face right!

311
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:34,393
Okay, that's enough.

312
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:35,894
Stop.

313
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:43,429
Stop it!

314
00:33:09,062 --> 00:33:13,396
Boy, be careful.
You play with fire.

315
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:28,371
Okay, I can tell you're not into this.

316
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:32,575
No, I am, really.
It just takes me a while.

317
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:34,086
Right.

318
00:33:34,154 --> 00:33:36,588
You know why I like you, Todd?

319
00:33:36,657 --> 00:33:40,753
Because you're the only guy
that never tried to impress me.

320
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:45,931
Can I ask you something?

321
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,324
Sure.

322
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:54,798
Do you ever wonder
why people do the things they do?

323
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:58,344
You think about it.

324
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,074
- Okay.
- Seriously.

325
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:10,620
It's better not to think.

326
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:13,888
It's better to just do it.

327
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,476
Who are you, kitty, kitty?

328
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,855
It's getting cold out here...

329
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:54,162
kitty, hmm?

330
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:11,548
Kitty.

331
00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:12,846
I'm sorry.

332
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:15,547
Maybe you'll be more in the mood later.

333
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:18,455
I don't know.
That's never really happened to me before.

334
00:35:19,593 --> 00:35:21,026
It's all right.

335
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,564
Could you blow that the other way, please?

336
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:33,572
Maybe you just don't like me.

337
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:37,033
No, it's not that at all.

338
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,079
- I really do.
- Maybe you just don't like girls.

339
00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:10,409
Kitty, kitty.

340
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:13,444
Good-bye.

341
00:36:25,325 --> 00:36:26,690
You motherfucker!

342
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:05,088
Class, you have five more minutes.

343
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:39,827
<i>"Dear Mr. & Mrs. Bowden:</i>

344
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,425
This note is to suggest
that we have a group conference...

345
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:44,697
concerning Todd's first semester grades.

346
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:48,400
In light of his previous excellent work,
the sudden decline in his grades...

347
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,943
suggests a specific problem
which should be addressed...

348
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:53,445
before his academic advancement
is jeopardized permanently.

349
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:55,674
I'm ready to work out
a time for us to meet.

350
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:57,512
In a case such as this,
earlier is usually better.

351
00:37:57,584 --> 00:37:59,449
Sincerely yours,
Edward French."

352
00:38:00,954 --> 00:38:03,923
- Jesus, man. What are you gonna do?
- Fuck if I know.

353
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,619
- What?
- I said, "Fuck if I know."

354
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:12,832
You're throwin' it up hard.
Let it roll off your fingers more.

355
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:16,357
- I don't need a lesson, okay?
- All right.

356
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:19,996
Man, with your dad too.

357
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:23,236
I'm a fuck-up.
My dad expects this from me. But you?

358
00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:30,806
You're talkin' to yourself.
What's goin' on with you?

359
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:34,149
Nothing. I fucked up.
I'll fix it.

360
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:36,212
Whatever you say, man.

361
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:41,126
- What's happening between you and Becky?
- Who?

362
00:38:41,995 --> 00:38:43,656
Becky Trask, idiot.

363
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,755
What did you call me?

364
00:38:49,169 --> 00:38:52,161
You're bein' a real dick, man.

365
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,173
I gotta get to practice.

366
00:38:59,913 --> 00:39:04,316
"You're talkin' to yourself, man.
You're bein' a dick."

367
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,328
<i>"...a time for us to meet.</i>

368
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:37,308
In such a case as this,
earlier is usually better.

369
00:40:37,377 --> 00:40:40,869
Sincerely yours,
Edward French."

370
00:40:40,947 --> 00:40:44,940
Who's this Edward French?
Headmaster?

371
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:47,912
No, he's a guidance counselor.

372
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,923
- Well, what is that?
- He guides and he counsels.

373
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,858
You read the letter.

374
00:40:55,795 --> 00:40:57,228
What stinks in here?

375
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,425
Oh, I bet it's my TV dinner,
I'm afraid.

376
00:41:05,972 --> 00:41:08,566
- We've got a problem here, you know?
- We?

377
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:12,133
- I'm not the one in trouble.
- We'll see about that.

378
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:14,737
You don't turn this around on me, boy.

379
00:41:14,814 --> 00:41:17,715
It's not my fault
your grades have fallen.

380
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:21,618
That's where you're wrong.
The shit you tell me keeps me up half the night.

381
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,122
I fall asleep during class.

382
00:41:28,161 --> 00:41:31,619
I need a fucking pencil.
Do you have one?

383
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,599
What will your parents do about this letter?

384
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:38,364
They're never gonna see it.
That's the whole point of this.

385
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:42,670
This isn't just a little slipup here.
My parents will freak.

386
00:41:44,344 --> 00:41:48,144
They're gonna wanna know exactly what happened,
and what happened is you.

387
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,614
You get what I'm telling you?

388
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:54,519
I think so.

389
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:56,521
You better be sure...

390
00:41:56,589 --> 00:41:59,649
'cause it's your sorry ass
that winds up in jail, not mine.

391
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,193
Goddamn it!
I need a pencil.

392
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:03,593
A sharp one, please.

393
00:42:03,663 --> 00:42:05,153
Thank you.

394
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,028
Does this Edward French...

395
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,501
know your parents in a social way?

396
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,300
No. My parents wouldn't mix
with a geek like him.

397
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:18,106
How about professionally?
Has he ever spoken to them?

398
00:42:18,178 --> 00:42:20,612
No. I've never needed it until now.

399
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:28,078
You're messing things up
with that carbon paper.

400
00:42:28,154 --> 00:42:31,555
- What do you know about it?
- Here. Out of the way.

401
00:42:31,624 --> 00:42:36,288
I was forging documents
before your parents were born.

402
00:42:54,314 --> 00:42:56,407
Todd, Mr. French will see you now.

403
00:42:56,483 --> 00:43:00,078
- Do you know what this is about?
- I'm sorry, I don't.

404
00:43:03,656 --> 00:43:05,214
See ya.

405
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:15,197
He means the world to me.

406
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:18,295
Hey, Todd.
Have a seat.

407
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,072
Hello there.

408
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:24,443
It's okay. Sit down.

409
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:31,510
We were just talking about
what's been going on.

410
00:43:32,952 --> 00:43:34,886
Do you wanna talk about it?

411
00:43:37,123 --> 00:43:39,387
Not really.

412
00:43:39,459 --> 00:43:42,189
You know, this is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

413
00:43:42,262 --> 00:43:44,890
It's not your fault,
and both of us...

414
00:43:44,964 --> 00:43:46,727
wanna help you get back on track.

415
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:48,892
Both of you?

416
00:43:50,036 --> 00:43:52,129
I must admit that...

417
00:43:52,205 --> 00:43:56,835
the situation in Richard's home
is appalling.

418
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,073
I was raised to believe
that a man should take responsibility...

419
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:01,807
for his family.

420
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:05,112
But when you came to me in tears...

421
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:07,813
and asked me to intervene...

422
00:44:07,887 --> 00:44:12,790
well then, I realized that this
was not a matter to be trifled with.

423
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,224
That's why...

424
00:44:14,294 --> 00:44:17,263
I arranged this meeting.

425
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,764
We all appreciate your concern, Victor.

426
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,323
I've been looking at your record...

427
00:44:22,402 --> 00:44:25,064
and according to your progress report
this quarter...

428
00:44:25,138 --> 00:44:29,404
every grade is way down,
even your strongest subjects.

429
00:44:29,475 --> 00:44:30,464
History:

430
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,273
You went from a solid "A"
to a "C" minus.

431
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:34,278
Trigonometry:

432
00:44:34,347 --> 00:44:36,178
Down to a "D"?

433
00:44:37,684 --> 00:44:41,620
Todd, did you know you were on your way
to finishing first in your class?

434
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:43,647
Yes.

435
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:48,627
Your grandfather and I have been talking
and we both agree...

436
00:44:48,695 --> 00:44:51,858
that with what's been going on,
what with your father's work problems...

437
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:54,695
and your mom with the drinking...

438
00:44:55,835 --> 00:44:58,861
that maybe home isn't the best place
to be studying.

439
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:02,101
So he's offered to let you study over
at his place...

440
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:04,336
every day after school.

441
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,503
Todd, I think it's a good idea.

442
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,706
- You do?
- Yeah.

443
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:11,341
In fact, I offered to go a step further.

444
00:45:12,385 --> 00:45:14,512
But it means you and I gotta make a deal.

445
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:17,547
What kind of deal?

446
00:45:17,624 --> 00:45:21,458
Well, finals for this quarter
are in 3 and a half weeks. Right?

447
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:25,190
Now, if you can give me all A's...

448
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:27,256
then I'll talk to your teachers...

449
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:30,097
and see if we can't discount your midterms...

450
00:45:30,169 --> 00:45:33,161
and let this quarter's grades
rest with your final exams.

451
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,175
But if you come back with B's or C's,
I can't help you.

452
00:45:37,243 --> 00:45:38,870
But all A's...

453
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,812
that shows everybody that you're serious.

454
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:45,146
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

455
00:45:46,819 --> 00:45:49,549
But first you gotta start
being honest with me.

456
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,427
No more forging your father's signature.

457
00:45:55,495 --> 00:45:58,760
No more hiding my letters.

458
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:00,924
For now we can deal
with just the three of us...

459
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,366
if it makes things easier at home.

460
00:46:03,436 --> 00:46:07,338
But you try and pull one over on me,
next time I show up on your doorstep.

461
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:09,068
Is that clear?

462
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:14,741
- He's offering to help...
- I know!

463
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,442
But that's a whole lot to do in three weeks.

464
00:46:17,517 --> 00:46:19,610
What if I can't do it?

465
00:46:19,686 --> 00:46:23,417
Mr. Bowden, I can't thank you enough
for coming down here today...

466
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,890
but if it's all right with you
I'd like to talk to Todd alone...

467
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:28,790
for a few minutes.

468
00:46:31,597 --> 00:46:34,122
Yes, it's quite all right.

469
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,134
If you didn't excuse me...

470
00:46:36,202 --> 00:46:39,467
I'm afraid that my desire for a cigarette would.

471
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,471
You can take my word,
when the time is right...

472
00:46:46,546 --> 00:46:49,743
I'll tell Richard about all this, you know.

473
00:46:49,816 --> 00:46:53,445
He and Monica need to know
what's happening to their son.

474
00:46:59,992 --> 00:47:02,256
I'll expect you after school.

475
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:20,277
- He's a very persuasive man.
- Tell me about it.

476
00:47:22,582 --> 00:47:25,847
Listen, Todd.
I understand what you're going through.

477
00:47:25,918 --> 00:47:27,943
I really do.

478
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,683
My wife and I, we just went through
the nastiest divorce since Henry VIII's.

479
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:36,127
And I know it's not easy
being a senior and only 16.

480
00:47:36,195 --> 00:47:39,790
And now we're asking a lot of you.

481
00:47:39,866 --> 00:47:41,925
But your grandfather thinks you can do this.

482
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:44,663
Todd, I know you can.

483
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,331
So from now on...

484
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:51,207
I don't want you to feel like
you have no one you can talk to, okay?

485
00:47:51,277 --> 00:47:54,610
Your parents, or girl problems...

486
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,342
Anything at all.
Here's my home phone.

487
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:00,881
Anything at all. Anything.

488
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:04,946
You call me, Todd.
Call me.

489
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,059
Deal?

490
00:48:08,127 --> 00:48:11,392
I'm telling you, buddy,
you get past this little hurdle...

491
00:48:11,464 --> 00:48:15,628
I promise you the world's gonna open up for you
like you won't believe.

492
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,212
Bye.

493
00:48:48,734 --> 00:48:50,167
Have you lost your mind?

494
00:48:50,236 --> 00:48:52,670
What the hell were you thinking, "Grandpa"?

495
00:48:52,738 --> 00:48:56,196
- What are you so excited about?
- Oh, you've got some fucking balls!

496
00:48:56,275 --> 00:48:58,300
I could've screwed you up.
Anything could've happened.

497
00:48:58,377 --> 00:49:00,709
You played it beautifully, boy.
I knew you would.

498
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,908
Are you fucking drunk?
I could've busted you right there.

499
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:08,215
Yes, you could have, but you did not.
Now why was that?

500
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:16,488
Your Edward French is not going
to give you any more trouble.

501
00:49:16,562 --> 00:49:21,590
Now you are upset because the only way
you can make things right is to work.

502
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,693
I'm upset because you had that asshole thinking
I can do something...

503
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:28,035
- that can't be done.
- Oh, but it can, and it will.

504
00:49:28,107 --> 00:49:31,873
You will simply have to work.
No more stories.

505
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:34,742
- No more screwing around.
- I don't take orders from you.

506
00:49:34,814 --> 00:49:38,147
- You do now.
- Oh, you think so?

507
00:49:38,217 --> 00:49:40,777
Don't forget, I can walk in there
and pick up that phone.

508
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,320
And do what?

509
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,554
Do you really think that I would stand aside...

510
00:49:48,628 --> 00:49:52,029
and let you turn me in
without dragging you with me?

511
00:49:52,098 --> 00:49:53,656
Do you?

512
00:49:53,733 --> 00:49:56,065
Your American self-confidence is so bloated...

513
00:49:56,135 --> 00:49:58,603
you've forgotten the reality of the situation.

514
00:49:58,671 --> 00:50:01,196
90,000 died in Patin.

515
00:50:01,274 --> 00:50:04,732
To the whole world, I am a monster.

516
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:09,577
And you have known about me all this time.

517
00:50:09,649 --> 00:50:13,278
If I'm caught, when those reporters
stick their microphones in my face...

518
00:50:13,352 --> 00:50:17,186
it will be your name
that I will repeat over and over again.

519
00:50:17,256 --> 00:50:18,746
Todd Bowden.

520
00:50:20,426 --> 00:50:22,553
Yes, that was his name.

521
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:25,995
For how long?
For months, almost a year.

522
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,590
He wanted to know everything.

523
00:50:28,668 --> 00:50:31,831
That was how he put it, yes.

524
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:34,031
Everything.

525
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:39,173
You're crazy.
They'll never believe you.

526
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,611
It doesn't matter.

527
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:45,845
Oh, you're going to be infamous, boy.
Take my word for it.

528
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:49,046
And you know what such a scandal can do.

529
00:50:49,121 --> 00:50:52,955
It never goes away.
Not for you.

530
00:50:53,025 --> 00:50:54,822
Not for your parents.

531
00:50:54,894 --> 00:50:59,388
And besides, lying to judges and reporters
isn't as easy as you think.

532
00:50:59,465 --> 00:51:02,195
You'd have to be brilliant.
Can you do that?

533
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,236
I know I can.

534
00:51:05,738 --> 00:51:07,672
There's no way in hell...

535
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,642
I'm gonna be able to pull myself out
of a half-year's slide in a few weeks.

536
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:15,010
- This shit just doesn't happen.
- Boy, the time for discussion is over.

537
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:17,948
This is the way it is.
You're going to work.

538
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:22,886
You're going to spend the rest of this quarter
and all your vacation studying.

539
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:03,241
<i>...one of the most interesting
writers of his fime.</i>

540
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,685
<i>...longitude and latitude.
There are coordinates...</i>

541
00:54:11,757 --> 00:54:14,089
<i>...both sides by 'y',
leaving you with 3xy...</i>

542
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:24,559
<i>...made some people do what they did,
and other people do nothing at all.</i>

543
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:26,764
<i>This concludes our week on the Holocaust.</i>

544
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:31,469
<i>If you wanna know more, you may find
the Santo Donato library an excellent...</i>

545
00:54:31,544 --> 00:54:34,342
<i>You are a monster.</i>

546
00:54:34,413 --> 00:54:35,937
<i>Is the thrill enough?</i>

547
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:39,109
<i>- What you have done is a violation.
- I wanted to know more.</i>

548
00:54:40,686 --> 00:54:43,883
<i>- I wanted to know more.
- A door had been opened...</i>

549
00:54:43,956 --> 00:54:46,447
<i>- I wanted to know more.
- ...lose control of their bodies...</i>

550
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:48,117
<i>- I fucked up.
- You'd have to be brilliant.</i>

551
00:54:48,194 --> 00:54:50,856
<i>Lying isn't as easy as you think.</i>

552
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,228
<i>- Maybe you just don't like girls.
- He's good at other things.</i>

553
00:54:53,299 --> 00:54:56,700
<i>- I'll fix it.
- You gotta start being honest with me.</i>

554
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:59,966
<i>Boy, be careful.
You play with fire.</i>

555
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,960
<i>It never goes away.</i>

556
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,137
<i>Not for you.</i>

557
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:29,817
How about some melba toast?

558
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,823
- Sure.
- Sure.

559
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:51,540
I would have expected you
to be doing back flips...

560
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:54,375
down the hallway after such good news.

561
00:56:55,815 --> 00:56:57,942
But you're so quiet.

562
00:57:01,954 --> 00:57:07,017
Today, I think I will give you
the day off from studying.

563
00:57:07,093 --> 00:57:09,027
How's that? Hmm?

564
00:57:12,532 --> 00:57:14,466
How about...

565
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:17,526
one of my stories instead?

566
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:22,540
I still have a few good ones left.

567
00:57:23,676 --> 00:57:25,610
- I don't care.
- Let's see.

568
00:57:25,678 --> 00:57:29,273
I could tell you about the special soap...

569
00:57:29,348 --> 00:57:31,373
we made.

570
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:35,251
Or there's always the story
of how I escaped from Berlin...

571
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:38,381
after I was so foolish as to go back.

572
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,393
That was a close one,
I can tell you.

573
00:57:43,596 --> 00:57:45,530
No, none of these.

574
00:57:45,598 --> 00:57:48,658
I think you don't seem to be in the mood.

575
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:54,137
I think today I will tell you the story...

576
00:57:55,741 --> 00:57:59,643
of an old man who was afraid.

577
00:57:59,712 --> 00:58:03,170
He was afraid of a certain young boy who was...

578
00:58:03,249 --> 00:58:05,410
in a clear way...

579
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,419
his friend.

580
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,581
The boy proved to be a very good student.

581
00:58:12,892 --> 00:58:16,760
But not perhaps in quite the way...

582
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:20,788
his mother and his teachers had envisioned.

583
00:58:23,903 --> 00:58:27,737
At first, the old man
disliked the boy intensely.

584
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:32,506
But then he began to enjoy the boy's company.

585
00:58:32,578 --> 00:58:37,572
Of course, there is still a great deal
of distrust between them.

586
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:42,948
Each knew something
the other wanted to keep secret.

587
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,549
Over time...

588
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:48,617
the old man felt...

589
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:51,185
his hold on the boy slipping away.

590
00:58:51,264 --> 00:58:55,462
He thought the day might come
when the boy no longer needed him.

591
00:58:57,069 --> 00:58:58,764
So...

592
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,239
one sleepless night...

593
00:59:02,308 --> 00:59:04,799
the old man got out of bed...

594
00:59:04,877 --> 00:59:09,143
and wrote down the story
of his involvement with the boy.

595
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:14,247
Everything he could remember...

596
00:59:16,722 --> 00:59:18,781
from the first day forward.

597
00:59:22,028 --> 00:59:24,326
He wrote how the boy forced his way...

598
00:59:24,397 --> 00:59:28,060
into the old man's house
and blackmailed the old man...

599
00:59:28,134 --> 00:59:31,968
to serve his own morbid fascinations.

600
00:59:32,038 --> 00:59:34,165
When the boy's grades began to fall...

601
00:59:35,308 --> 00:59:37,970
he blamed the old man and ordered him...

602
00:59:38,044 --> 00:59:40,979
to impersonate his grandfather.

603
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:44,778
At the end,
his hands were stinging with arthritis...

604
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:48,115
but he felt happy for the first time in weeks.

605
00:59:51,857 --> 00:59:53,791
He felt safe.

606
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,564
On the following morning,
the old man...

607
00:59:59,632 --> 01:00:02,624
put on his best suit...

608
01:00:02,702 --> 01:00:05,967
and went down to one of the local banks...

609
01:00:06,038 --> 01:00:09,303
and rented a safe deposit box.

610
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:13,870
The bank officer explained to the old man...

611
01:00:13,946 --> 01:00:17,712
that only the old man
could use the old man's key...

612
01:00:17,783 --> 01:00:20,081
with one exception.

613
01:00:22,188 --> 01:00:24,748
The exception was...

614
01:00:24,824 --> 01:00:30,490
in the event
of the box holder's death, then...

615
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:34,424
Then what?

616
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,129
The box will be opened
in the presence of a bank official...

617
01:00:38,204 --> 01:00:41,765
and a representative
of the Internal Revenue Service.

618
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:45,299
The contents of the box would be inventoried.

619
01:00:45,378 --> 01:00:47,073
But in this case...

620
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:51,207
they would only find a 12-page document.

621
01:00:52,451 --> 01:00:57,286
Nontaxable, but highly interesting.

622
01:00:58,591 --> 01:01:00,889
You didn't do this.
I don't believe you.

623
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,588
My boy...

624
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:05,688
it is already done.

625
01:01:05,765 --> 01:01:07,528
Jesus fucking Christ!
Look at you!

626
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,228
You could go at any time.

627
01:01:13,439 --> 01:01:14,929
Don't be so theatrical.

628
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:18,204
A man five or ten years older than me,
worries more...

629
01:01:18,277 --> 01:01:20,905
about his ailing heart than being...

630
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,574
sent off to Israel.

631
01:01:23,649 --> 01:01:27,449
And the day will come,
if I live long enough...

632
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,047
when I decide that what you know
no longer matters.

633
01:01:31,123 --> 01:01:36,151
But then, and only then,
I will destroy the document.

634
01:01:36,228 --> 01:01:38,594
So many things can happen in between.

635
01:01:38,664 --> 01:01:41,132
Accidents, sickness.

636
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,964
You could slip in the fucking shower,
for Christ's sake.

637
01:01:44,837 --> 01:01:48,295
<i>Whatever will be will be</i>

638
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:51,605
<i>The future's not ours to see</i>

639
01:01:51,677 --> 01:01:54,737
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

640
01:02:00,419 --> 01:02:04,355
I can see you're thinking it now,
even now.

641
01:02:04,423 --> 01:02:08,621
It's in your eyes...
killing me.

642
01:02:08,694 --> 01:02:11,788
All it would take would be
the flick of a knife.

643
01:02:13,165 --> 01:02:16,259
Push me down the steps,
make it look like an accident.

644
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:20,032
I am old. You are strong.
You're angry.

645
01:02:20,106 --> 01:02:22,666
Good assets for killing.

646
01:02:22,742 --> 01:02:26,337
But there is something missing.

647
01:02:27,546 --> 01:02:32,006
To have someone in your control...

648
01:02:34,954 --> 01:02:38,685
To have them know that they are alive...

649
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:44,128
only because you have not decided
to the contrary.

650
01:02:45,197 --> 01:02:49,133
Do you have that power?
Ask yourself.

651
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:52,796
It's not an easy question.
I think you know that.

652
01:02:59,845 --> 01:03:02,040
You know this means we're through, don't you?

653
01:03:03,315 --> 01:03:05,579
You won't be seein' me around here anymore.

654
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:10,816
I suppose I won't.

655
01:03:16,495 --> 01:03:18,019
What are you doing?

656
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:22,033
This is the end.

657
01:03:25,571 --> 01:03:27,505
Here.

658
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:32,503
A drink.

659
01:03:33,245 --> 01:03:35,179
To our lives together.

660
01:03:35,247 --> 01:03:37,613
The beginning and the end.

661
01:03:46,926 --> 01:03:48,917
I think you should fuck yourself.

662
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:52,259
Oh, my dear boy.
Don't you see?

663
01:03:52,331 --> 01:03:54,993
We are fucking each other.

664
01:04:08,814 --> 01:04:09,781
<i>Strike!</i>

665
01:04:11,617 --> 01:04:13,881
Two outs!

666
01:04:31,203 --> 01:04:32,898
Strike three!

667
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:41,571
<i>What are you guys waitin' for?
Let's go!</i>

668
01:04:42,715 --> 01:04:44,649
Rebound! Move it!

669
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:41,232
Watch your step.

670
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:18,769
Sir?

671
01:07:18,837 --> 01:07:20,771
Excuse me.

672
01:07:26,545 --> 01:07:28,479
I can help you carry those.

673
01:07:28,547 --> 01:07:31,243
You don't gotta be afraid.
I can help you.

674
01:07:31,316 --> 01:07:34,342
I don't need your help.
Excuse me.

675
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:37,412
I'm not a bad guy.
You don't gotta worry.

676
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:41,016
- Please, I just wanna...
- What do you want?

677
01:07:41,093 --> 01:07:44,529
- Why do you bother me?
- We're practically neighbors.

678
01:07:44,596 --> 01:07:47,827
You know, I stay right over there most nights.

679
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,425
I mean, I see you walk down the street.

680
01:07:50,502 --> 01:07:53,232
I just wanna help.

681
01:07:53,305 --> 01:07:56,274
- It's called being neighborly.
- Piss off.

682
01:07:56,341 --> 01:07:59,538
You don't...

683
01:07:59,611 --> 01:08:02,546
There's no reason to be rude!
No reason!

684
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:07,011
I know something about you.

685
01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:12,486
I know you're a nice guy.

686
01:08:14,526 --> 01:08:17,393
I'm nice too, just like the boy.

687
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:23,167
I see.

688
01:08:23,235 --> 01:08:27,194
I'm not ashamed to say
that I could use a drink about now.

689
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:31,209
But I don't take no charity.

690
01:08:32,544 --> 01:08:35,240
If you were to invite me in
like a friend...

691
01:08:35,314 --> 01:08:36,906
then we could have a nice drink.

692
01:08:36,982 --> 01:08:38,244
A drink.

693
01:08:38,317 --> 01:08:40,182
That's what I'm sayin'.

694
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,813
You smell like a toilet.

695
01:08:45,257 --> 01:08:47,521
Maybe you'll let me use your shower.

696
01:08:47,593 --> 01:08:49,356
But first a drink.

697
01:08:49,428 --> 01:08:51,828
Then I will do anything you say.

698
01:09:07,112 --> 01:09:09,910
I had 'em hooked up, rollin'...

699
01:09:09,982 --> 01:09:11,882
4 and a half.

700
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:14,350
But three minutes, that was my best.

701
01:09:14,419 --> 01:09:17,547
I was, like, movin' double time.

702
01:09:17,623 --> 01:09:20,820
Gosh, you know...
I didn't...

703
01:09:20,893 --> 01:09:24,260
didn't see that dog in the back seat.

704
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:26,388
- Didn't see it.
- What dog?

705
01:09:26,465 --> 01:09:28,433
That dog.
I heard it barking.

706
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,435
But I hear dogs barking all the time,
even when they ain't there.

707
01:09:31,503 --> 01:09:34,336
So I didn't pay no mind.

708
01:09:34,406 --> 01:09:37,466
D.O.T. didn't wanna hire me
'cause of that thing with the...

709
01:09:37,543 --> 01:09:39,477
Anyway.

710
01:09:40,579 --> 01:09:42,410
Who wants to talk about that?

711
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:46,982
So I was...

712
01:09:47,052 --> 01:09:50,021
I was an independent, you know...

713
01:09:50,088 --> 01:09:53,148
which meant that I could go
all over the whole city.

714
01:09:53,225 --> 01:09:55,159
You know, I believe...

715
01:09:56,628 --> 01:09:59,062
we need another bottle.

716
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:03,732
If you're offering, then we accept.

717
01:10:05,204 --> 01:10:06,603
That's no trouble at all.

718
01:10:06,672 --> 01:10:09,971
Look, why don't you drink mine?

719
01:10:11,043 --> 01:10:12,101
Thank you.

720
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:20,077
So, like I was sayin'...

721
01:10:20,152 --> 01:10:22,086
I was...

722
01:10:22,154 --> 01:10:24,816
I worked as an independent.

723
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:27,552
'Cause the D.O.T.,
they wouldn't hire me, right?

724
01:10:27,626 --> 01:10:29,958
So I was able to go...

725
01:10:30,028 --> 01:10:32,997
<i>all over the whole city.</i>

726
01:10:33,065 --> 01:10:35,533
Midtown, downtown,
left side, right side...

727
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:38,468
Where is my bottle opener?

728
01:10:38,537 --> 01:10:40,061
There it is.

729
01:10:40,138 --> 01:10:42,106
You stay right there.

730
01:10:51,516 --> 01:10:53,575
<i>So then I moved on.</i>

731
01:10:53,652 --> 01:10:56,519
Washington Heights was good.
It was always good...

732
01:10:56,588 --> 01:10:59,216
<i>because there were a lot
of nooks and crannies, you know.</i>

733
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:04,395
The D. R.'s... the Dominicans there,
they liked to...

734
01:11:04,463 --> 01:11:06,988
<i>go around in their cars
like they were buses.</i>

735
01:11:17,376 --> 01:11:20,743
Then they dropped that cinder block
on that cop from three-four.

736
01:11:20,812 --> 01:11:23,372
And it got all crazy.
But you gotta be movin', 'cause...

737
01:11:23,448 --> 01:11:26,076
they come back,
they catch you hookin' their ride.

738
01:11:52,344 --> 01:11:54,278
Do you mind?

739
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:58,343
No. Not at all.

740
01:12:10,295 --> 01:12:12,092
Maybe in the morning...

741
01:12:12,164 --> 01:12:15,725
perhaps everything goes okay,
you could let me have $10.

742
01:12:17,202 --> 01:12:19,136
Perhaps.

743
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,269
Even a 20...

744
01:12:23,342 --> 01:12:26,436
Perhaps. We shall see.

745
01:12:26,511 --> 01:12:29,742
You can relax, you know.
I've done this before.

746
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:31,946
That's all right.

747
01:12:33,485 --> 01:12:35,112
So have I.

748
01:12:35,187 --> 01:12:36,984
Let me go pee first.

749
01:13:48,794 --> 01:13:51,194
Did you look at this
before you signed it?

750
01:13:51,263 --> 01:13:53,857
That bill was written in Japanese.

751
01:13:53,932 --> 01:13:55,923
- I told you that.
- Numbers are numbers in any language.

752
01:13:56,001 --> 01:13:58,401
That man did not speak one word of English.

753
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,995
- That's not the point.
- Of course it's the point.

754
01:14:01,073 --> 01:14:04,338
The point is you look at a bill
before you pay it.

755
01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:07,845
I did not understand one word.
That's exactly the point.

756
01:14:07,913 --> 01:14:09,471
Hello?

757
01:14:09,548 --> 01:14:11,015
Yes.

758
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:12,710
Maybe it was in yen.

759
01:14:14,252 --> 01:14:15,651
Maybe it is.

760
01:14:16,855 --> 01:14:20,347
It's Mr. Denker.
He sounds very anxious.

761
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:26,494
Why would he be calling at this hour?

762
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:29,534
- Hello?
<i>- Come over right away, boy.</i>

763
01:14:29,601 --> 01:14:32,229
I'm having a heart attack.

764
01:14:32,304 --> 01:14:34,602
A bad one, I think.

765
01:14:34,673 --> 01:14:38,268
That sounds exciting,
but I have to study for my trig final.

766
01:14:38,343 --> 01:14:41,506
I understand you cannot talk,
but you can listen.

767
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:46,074
<i>I cannot call an ambulance.
I need help.</i>

768
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:49,416
And that means you need help.

769
01:14:49,488 --> 01:14:51,422
If you put it that way.

770
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:54,254
<i>Tell you parents I have an important letter...</i>

771
01:14:54,326 --> 01:14:57,955
and I need you to read it to me.

772
01:14:58,029 --> 01:14:59,462
I'll be right over.

773
01:15:00,765 --> 01:15:03,290
Now we'll see what you're made of.

774
01:15:21,086 --> 01:15:22,110
What happened?

775
01:15:23,188 --> 01:15:24,450
Ah, boy.

776
01:15:24,523 --> 01:15:27,390
- Where are you bleeding?
- It's not my blood.

777
01:15:28,793 --> 01:15:31,990
It was self-defense.
Boy, now listen.

778
01:15:32,063 --> 01:15:34,998
- What are you talking about?
- Shut up.

779
01:15:35,066 --> 01:15:38,968
Nobody comes here until you have done
what needs to be done.

780
01:15:40,172 --> 01:15:42,106
Go down the steps.

781
01:15:52,784 --> 01:15:54,308
What did you do?

782
01:15:55,887 --> 01:15:58,583
Go down the steps, huh?

783
01:15:58,657 --> 01:16:00,591
That's right.

784
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,772
Let me out!

785
01:16:17,909 --> 01:16:19,843
- Let me the fuck outta here!
- No, boy.

786
01:16:19,911 --> 01:16:23,039
If you won't help me,
I have to make you.

787
01:16:23,114 --> 01:16:24,877
That's enough!

788
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:27,441
Open the goddamned door!
Do you hear me?

789
01:16:32,924 --> 01:16:33,788
Fuck you!

790
01:16:33,858 --> 01:16:39,194
If you're going to behave
like a fucking schoolgirl, I'll...

791
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,301
I'm gonna break your goddamn door down!

792
01:16:46,037 --> 01:16:47,004
Fuck!

793
01:16:52,777 --> 01:16:55,974
Don't be afraid, boy.

794
01:17:00,151 --> 01:17:01,812
I know what you're doing.

795
01:17:01,886 --> 01:17:04,514
I'm gonna break the goddamn door down!

796
01:17:04,589 --> 01:17:06,557
What are you doing?

797
01:17:08,893 --> 01:17:10,656
There is no point.

798
01:17:43,662 --> 01:17:45,254
Why are you doing this?

799
01:19:19,157 --> 01:19:21,523
Call an ambulance.

800
01:19:25,397 --> 01:19:27,331
The key.

801
01:19:29,868 --> 01:19:31,802
The key to the safe deposit box.

802
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:34,566
Where is it?

803
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:38,200
Boy, I need a doctor.

804
01:19:38,276 --> 01:19:40,039
Now.

805
01:19:40,111 --> 01:19:42,045
Give me the key.

806
01:19:46,317 --> 01:19:48,649
I'm dying.

807
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:53,123
I know.

808
01:20:00,098 --> 01:20:03,727
Oh, no.
Not like this.

809
01:20:04,636 --> 01:20:06,365
Please.

810
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:21,448
<i>You did good, son.</i>

811
01:20:21,519 --> 01:20:23,453
You did real good.

812
01:20:46,811 --> 01:20:50,770
It's a good thing you called us when you did.
You saved his life.

813
01:21:24,816 --> 01:21:25,748
Dad.

814
01:21:27,118 --> 01:21:30,519
Let's go make sure
he gets checked in all right.

815
01:22:37,922 --> 01:22:40,049
You shouldn't have.

816
01:22:41,726 --> 01:22:43,660
It's from my mother.

817
01:22:49,734 --> 01:22:53,727
They say the operation was a success.

818
01:22:55,607 --> 01:22:59,338
They say I have another 20 years.

819
01:23:00,445 --> 01:23:03,437
A new lease on life.

820
01:23:17,428 --> 01:23:22,627
I took care of everything,
except for the key. Where is it?

821
01:23:30,475 --> 01:23:33,376
There's no safe deposit box.

822
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:36,913
There never was.

823
01:23:38,349 --> 01:23:39,646
I lied.

824
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:45,983
I had to protect myself from you, boy.

825
01:23:46,057 --> 01:23:47,991
You understand?

826
01:23:54,932 --> 01:23:59,926
I suspect that we will
never see each other again.

827
01:24:00,004 --> 01:24:02,165
- No, we won't.
- Wait.

828
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:06,336
I want to ask you something.

829
01:24:09,113 --> 01:24:10,603
What?

830
01:24:13,384 --> 01:24:15,682
What did it feel like?

831
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:28,255
- I better go.
- Wait.

832
01:24:30,635 --> 01:24:33,229
Perhaps l...

833
01:24:33,304 --> 01:24:35,932
Perhaps I could persuade you to stay.

834
01:24:36,007 --> 01:24:38,407
Just until I fall asleep.

835
01:24:38,476 --> 01:24:41,309
My medicine makes me drowsy.

836
01:24:43,681 --> 01:24:45,615
Please?

837
01:25:17,048 --> 01:25:19,346
Excuse me, young man.

838
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:22,875
You are a very good boy
to visit your grandfather like that.

839
01:25:22,954 --> 01:25:25,388
Thank you, but he's just a friend.

840
01:25:25,456 --> 01:25:29,187
Then you are a very good friend.

841
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,227
Tell me.

842
01:25:33,364 --> 01:25:36,162
Is he very bad off?
He doesn't talk much.

843
01:25:36,234 --> 01:25:39,829
- The doctors say he'll be out soon.
- That's good news.

844
01:25:39,904 --> 01:25:44,204
From the way he speaks,
I would guess he was German.

845
01:25:44,275 --> 01:25:47,608
- From the south, I think.
- I don't know.

846
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:51,807
I wonder if he was in the war.

847
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:55,817
I don't think so.
He's never mentioned it, anyway.

848
01:25:55,887 --> 01:25:57,912
It doesn't matter, I suppose.

849
01:25:57,989 --> 01:26:00,423
It was a long time ago, the war.

850
01:26:00,491 --> 01:26:02,857
Soon, in this country...

851
01:26:02,927 --> 01:26:08,058
we will have a president
born after the war was over.

852
01:26:08,132 --> 01:26:10,066
How about that?

853
01:26:11,402 --> 01:26:14,462
- I'm sure you're right.
- He is so very lucky...

854
01:26:14,539 --> 01:26:16,530
to have you.

855
01:26:16,607 --> 01:26:18,905
A great man once said...

856
01:26:18,976 --> 01:26:20,910
"No man is an island...

857
01:26:20,978 --> 01:26:23,572
entire of itself."

858
01:26:23,648 --> 01:26:24,808
John Donne.

859
01:26:25,950 --> 01:26:28,976
- Have a nice evening, sir.
- Good-bye.

860
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,026
<i>Mr. Jefferson, I don't have to listen
to that kind of talk.</i>

861
01:26:46,103 --> 01:26:47,627
<i>Then how about this kind of talk?</i>

862
01:26:55,046 --> 01:26:57,105
<i>That's just a warning.</i>

863
01:26:58,382 --> 01:27:03,046
<i>Anytime you crave for Florence's food,
that's a weird craving.</i>

864
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,418
<i>Jenny's the one who's pregnant.</i>

865
01:27:05,489 --> 01:27:07,582
<i>They said they had something to tell us.</i>

866
01:27:07,658 --> 01:27:12,618
<i>- Something important.
- Oh, we're gonna be grandparents again!</i>

867
01:27:12,697 --> 01:27:15,689
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to tell everybody!</i>

868
01:28:01,445 --> 01:28:03,379
<i>Hey, Ralph. Great!</i>

869
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:05,608
<i>Huh? Thanks, Ralph.</i>

870
01:28:05,683 --> 01:28:10,484
<i>The kids just got out of a cab.
They should be here any second.</i>

871
01:29:15,953 --> 01:29:18,114
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

872
01:29:54,425 --> 01:29:56,359
Yes.

873
01:29:56,427 --> 01:29:58,019
I'm speaking to you.

874
01:30:19,917 --> 01:30:23,148
Mr. Kramer is recuperating elsewhere.

875
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:26,951
- Are you awake now, Dussander?
- Yes, of course.

876
01:30:27,024 --> 01:30:30,926
But you seem to have confused me
with someone else.

877
01:30:32,396 --> 01:30:35,194
My name is Denker.

878
01:30:35,266 --> 01:30:38,565
Perhaps you need a different room.

879
01:30:38,636 --> 01:30:42,402
My name is Weiskopf,
and you are Kurt Dussander.

880
01:30:42,473 --> 01:30:44,998
No, I don't know no one by that name.

881
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:47,036
Should I call a nurse?

882
01:30:50,714 --> 01:30:54,150
The man in the next bed was Benjamin Kramer.

883
01:30:54,218 --> 01:30:57,381
He was imprisoned for ten months at Patin.

884
01:30:57,455 --> 01:31:01,255
You were responsible for the death
of his wife and two daughters.

885
01:31:01,325 --> 01:31:04,658
My name is Denker.
Arthur Denker.

886
01:31:04,728 --> 01:31:07,060
- I am an American.
- Please, don't bother.

887
01:31:07,131 --> 01:31:12,626
Your papers won't stand up to serious examination
and you know it.

888
01:31:12,703 --> 01:31:15,570
- I think we have all we need here.
- Who are these men?

889
01:31:15,639 --> 01:31:17,800
I'm Dan Richler,
special agent with the F.B.I...

890
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,843
and this is Detective Getty with the L.A.P.D.

891
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:22,378
And I think you know who I work for.

892
01:31:22,446 --> 01:31:25,006
When you regain your strength,
you will be moved.

893
01:31:25,082 --> 01:31:28,609
Until then,
this entire ward will be under guard.

894
01:31:28,686 --> 01:31:33,453
You can expect to be in Jerusalem
by the end of the summer.

895
01:31:51,709 --> 01:31:55,145
- So where do you want us to sit?
- Anywhere but the front row.

896
01:31:55,212 --> 01:31:58,704
- Yeah? There's, uh, Carla.
- Carla! How are you?

897
01:31:58,782 --> 01:32:01,342
- Hi. Hi, Chelsea.
- I thought that was you.

898
01:32:01,418 --> 01:32:05,855
Hi. Congratulations.
It's a big day for everybody.

899
01:32:05,923 --> 01:32:07,982
- How are you?
- Excuse me.

900
01:32:16,567 --> 01:32:19,468
You did it. I knew you could.
I am so proud of you.

901
01:32:19,537 --> 01:32:22,097
- Thank you.
- Oh, hi. These must be your parents.

902
01:32:22,173 --> 01:32:25,973
- Yeah. Dick Bowden. Nice to meet you.
- Ed French.

903
01:32:26,043 --> 01:32:29,604
- Todd pulled one off. You must be proud.
- Yes, we are.

904
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,910
- This is my wife, Monica.
- Hi.

905
01:32:31,982 --> 01:32:35,918
- Are you a teacher of Todd's?
- Actually, I'm his guidance counselor.

906
01:32:35,986 --> 01:32:38,250
- Oh, great.
- Nice to meet you.

907
01:32:38,322 --> 01:32:41,416
Yeah. I was looking forward to seeing
your grandfather, Victor. Where is he?

908
01:32:41,492 --> 01:32:46,191
It's a long trip from Charlotte.
He's been in a wheelchair for a few years.

909
01:32:46,263 --> 01:32:48,493
So they don't get out here much.

910
01:32:48,566 --> 01:32:50,534
Usually Thanksgiving.

911
01:32:52,903 --> 01:32:55,167
I'm- I'm sorry.
I don't...

912
01:32:55,239 --> 01:32:57,673
I don't understand.

913
01:32:59,243 --> 01:33:00,767
That's your cue.

914
01:33:00,844 --> 01:33:03,870
That's my cue. Okay.
Good luck up there.

915
01:33:03,948 --> 01:33:06,178
- Nice to meet you.
- Take care, Ed.

916
01:33:11,088 --> 01:33:14,854
I don't feel so well. Maybe after the ceremony,
we could go straight home.

917
01:33:14,925 --> 01:33:18,361
- Are you okay?
- You know what? It's probably nerves.

918
01:33:18,429 --> 01:33:22,024
- Just take a deep breath.
- We'll see how it goes.

919
01:33:26,103 --> 01:33:29,971
All great achievements
arose from dissatisfaction.

920
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:36,470
It is the desire to do better...

921
01:33:36,547 --> 01:33:38,481
to dig deeper...

922
01:33:38,549 --> 01:33:41,882
that propels a civilization to greatness.

923
01:33:41,952 --> 01:33:44,113
All of us have heard the story of Icarus...

924
01:33:45,789 --> 01:33:48,690
the young boy who took the wings
his father built for him...

925
01:33:48,759 --> 01:33:53,253
<i>wings that were meant
to carry him over the ocean to freedom...</i>

926
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:56,663
<i>and used them instead for a joyride.</i>

927
01:34:08,178 --> 01:34:11,011
For a brief moment...

928
01:34:11,081 --> 01:34:13,743
Icarus felt what it was like
to live as a god...

929
01:34:13,817 --> 01:34:16,217
to touch the sun...

930
01:34:16,287 --> 01:34:18,778
to soar above the common man.

931
01:34:19,823 --> 01:34:23,259
And for doing so,
he paid the ultimate price.

932
01:34:24,828 --> 01:34:28,025
You boys better come down to the cellar.
You're not gonna believe this.

933
01:34:28,098 --> 01:34:32,034
Like Icarus, we too have been given gifts:

934
01:34:32,102 --> 01:34:35,094
Knowledge, education...

935
01:34:35,172 --> 01:34:37,606
experience.

936
01:34:38,976 --> 01:34:42,707
<i>And with these gifts
comes the responsibility of choice.</i>

937
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:46,375
We alone decide how our talents
are bestowed upon the world.

938
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:48,714
This is our destiny...

939
01:34:48,786 --> 01:34:51,313
<i>and we hold it in the palm of our hands.</i>

940
01:35:48,946 --> 01:35:51,414
<i>...of an investigation by local police...</i>

941
01:35:51,482 --> 01:35:53,541
<i>the sheriff's department, F.B.I...</i>

942
01:35:53,617 --> 01:35:55,847
<i>and the Department of Justice.</i>

943
01:35:55,919 --> 01:35:58,911
<i>Police have confirmed
that a body has been found...</i>

944
01:35:58,989 --> 01:36:01,480
<i>in the basement of Arthur Denker...</i>

945
01:36:01,558 --> 01:36:04,550
<i>the Santo Donato resident
believed to be...</i>

946
01:36:04,628 --> 01:36:06,596
<i>a Nazi war criminal.</i>

947
01:36:06,663 --> 01:36:09,791
<i>The cause of death has not been revealed...</i>

948
01:36:09,867 --> 01:36:12,961
<i>and authorities are withholding
identification of the body...</i>

949
01:36:13,036 --> 01:36:15,766
<i>until more information is available.</i>

950
01:36:15,839 --> 01:36:19,502
<i>The apprehension of Dussander
would bring to a close...</i>

951
01:36:19,576 --> 01:36:24,536
<i>a manhunt that's been underway now
for 40 years in three continents.</i>

952
01:36:35,392 --> 01:36:37,326
I'll be taking care of you from now on.

953
01:36:40,197 --> 01:36:41,255
Try to relax.

954
01:36:44,935 --> 01:36:48,029
Todd, I'm Dan Richler.
I'm a special agent with the F.B.I...

955
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:51,268
and this is Dr. Weiskopf.
If you don't mind, I'd like to hear about...

956
01:36:51,341 --> 01:36:53,275
your involvement with Dussander.

957
01:36:53,343 --> 01:36:56,005
Well, actually, you knew him as Arthur Denker.
Isn't that right?

958
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:58,741
- Yes.
- How did you know him?

959
01:36:58,816 --> 01:37:01,250
Are you sure you feel up to this?

960
01:37:01,318 --> 01:37:03,252
Yeah, I'll be fine.

961
01:37:10,461 --> 01:37:12,554
<i>Let me tell you what we're interested in.</i>

962
01:37:12,629 --> 01:37:14,927
You told the admitting nurse
that Arthur Denker...

963
01:37:14,998 --> 01:37:17,592
had a heart attack
while you were reading him a letter.

964
01:37:17,668 --> 01:37:21,104
- Yes.
- Was it in English or German?

965
01:37:21,171 --> 01:37:22,570
German.

966
01:37:24,107 --> 01:37:26,803
- You speak German?
- No.

967
01:37:26,877 --> 01:37:29,141
So you had no idea what you were reading.

968
01:37:29,213 --> 01:37:33,877
No. But he seemed to understand
every word I was saying.

969
01:37:39,556 --> 01:37:43,583
What we can't seem to figure out
is the letter, Todd.

970
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:46,652
Do you have any idea what happened to it?

971
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:49,426
I guess it's still on the table.
I couldn't swear to it, though.

972
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,025
- Then it still should be there.
- It isn't?

973
01:37:52,102 --> 01:37:55,128
No. Well, when you arrived, Mr. Bowden,
do you remember seeing a letter?

974
01:37:57,074 --> 01:38:00,771
But I wasn't looking for a letter.
I was more concerned about Todd.

975
01:38:00,844 --> 01:38:02,607
Maybe somebody broke in and took it.

976
01:38:02,679 --> 01:38:05,307
Why would somebody break into a house
simply to steal a letter?

977
01:38:05,382 --> 01:38:08,146
Unless, of course,
they wanted to protect him.

978
01:38:08,218 --> 01:38:11,517
You know, a close friend, another fugitive.

979
01:38:11,588 --> 01:38:13,954
Look, I know all this sounds like
Robert Ludlum kind of stuff...

980
01:38:14,024 --> 01:38:17,289
but we think that while Dussander
was in the hospital...

981
01:38:17,361 --> 01:38:22,628
our "Mr. X" scooted over to the house
and swiped the letter.

982
01:38:22,699 --> 01:38:25,827
- That doesn't make sense.
- Why not?

983
01:38:28,505 --> 01:38:30,473
Well, if he had an old Nazi buddy in town...

984
01:38:30,541 --> 01:38:32,532
why didn't he come over
and read the letter himself?

985
01:38:32,609 --> 01:38:35,772
Well, maybe he's in a wheelchair.
Or maybe he's blind.

986
01:38:35,846 --> 01:38:40,647
Well, guys that are blind
don't normally go scooting out to steal letters.

987
01:38:43,287 --> 01:38:45,983
Did he ever talk about his past?

988
01:38:52,696 --> 01:38:55,062
Excuse me, Dr. Weiskopf.
I'm just curious.

989
01:38:55,132 --> 01:38:57,965
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I'm a schoolteacher.

990
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:03,633
Dr. Weiskopf is a professor
at the Judaic Institute in Munich.

991
01:39:03,707 --> 01:39:06,699
He assists the Israeli government
in certain matters.

992
01:39:45,415 --> 01:39:46,347
Hey, buddy?

993
01:39:46,416 --> 01:39:48,213
You okay?

994
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,551
Yeah, I'm fine.

995
01:39:51,622 --> 01:39:53,783
- You sure?
- Yeah.

996
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:00,696
I just can't believe it,
even after what those guys told me.

997
01:40:00,764 --> 01:40:03,961
- It's mind-boggling.
- Your mother and I feel terrible.

998
01:40:04,034 --> 01:40:06,093
It's like we let you down.

999
01:40:06,169 --> 01:40:09,070
It's not your fault.

1000
01:40:09,139 --> 01:40:12,905
We're gonna go down and talk to a lawyer.
He's very good.

1001
01:40:12,976 --> 01:40:16,537
It's nothing for you to worry about.
It's just I don't trust these cops.

1002
01:40:17,614 --> 01:40:21,880
- Okay. I think that's a good idea.
- Yeah.

1003
01:40:21,952 --> 01:40:24,853
Well, your old man's on top of this, all right?
We'll take care of this.

1004
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:28,283
I know.

1005
01:40:29,626 --> 01:40:32,220
- Dad?
- Yeah?

1006
01:40:32,996 --> 01:40:35,396
I really never knew anything about this.

1007
01:40:36,433 --> 01:40:40,392
- I never thought you did.
- I know.

1008
01:40:41,204 --> 01:40:43,172
See you later.

1009
01:40:48,745 --> 01:40:51,145
Are you going to talk to the boy again?

1010
01:40:52,182 --> 01:40:55,276
- I don't think so.
- Somehow, he didn't even...

1011
01:40:59,489 --> 01:41:02,083
When you were a boy...

1012
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,525
what did you do for fun?

1013
01:41:05,629 --> 01:41:06,926
Went to the movies.

1014
01:41:08,765 --> 01:41:10,460
Why? What'd you do?

1015
01:41:11,435 --> 01:41:13,369
I used to chase girls.

1016
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,570
And now, I chase old men.

1017
01:41:48,939 --> 01:41:51,237
Special Agent Richler, Dr. Weiskopf...

1018
01:41:51,308 --> 01:41:53,503
this is the hospital administrator,
Dr. McCormick.

1019
01:41:53,577 --> 01:41:55,772
His chief of staff, Dr. Stewart.

1020
01:41:55,846 --> 01:41:57,973
- How do you do?
- Hello, ma'am.

1021
01:41:58,048 --> 01:42:01,245
- Do we have a plan?
- McCormick's arranged an exit for us.

1022
01:42:13,396 --> 01:42:15,921
- Mr. French.
- Hello, Todd.

1023
01:42:15,999 --> 01:42:18,058
What are you doing here?

1024
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:29,704
I came by to see your parents.
Are they home?

1025
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:32,112
No. What about?

1026
01:42:32,182 --> 01:42:34,673
That's between me and your parents.

1027
01:42:34,751 --> 01:42:36,912
Why isn't it between you and me?

1028
01:42:38,522 --> 01:42:40,786
Do you want to tell me what happened?

1029
01:43:43,486 --> 01:43:45,750
He needs to be turned on his left side.

1030
01:43:47,023 --> 01:43:49,014
- Watch his line.
- Get him over.

1031
01:43:50,327 --> 01:43:52,352
I wouldn't know where to begin.

1032
01:43:52,429 --> 01:43:55,023
Well, you're gonna have to tell me something.

1033
01:43:56,867 --> 01:44:00,462
I can tell you that it'd be better
if we both just forgot about that.

1034
01:44:01,938 --> 01:44:03,906
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

1035
01:44:09,613 --> 01:44:11,240
Get the crash cart!
Stat!

1036
01:44:14,651 --> 01:44:18,178
Why don't you tell your parents
I'll be back to see them later.

1037
01:44:22,425 --> 01:44:25,155
- What?
- I thought we had a deal here.

1038
01:44:25,228 --> 01:44:27,594
"Pull up your grades
and the world will open up for you."

1039
01:44:27,664 --> 01:44:30,224
What do you mean?
You want me to just forget about this?

1040
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:32,359
I just want to go to college
and get on with my life.

1041
01:44:32,435 --> 01:44:35,666
Todd, okay. You know,
we're not gonna talk about this right now.

1042
01:44:35,739 --> 01:44:40,039
It was a mistake to come here.
I'll do this over the phone.

1043
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:42,169
<i>Clear the way!</i>

1044
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:47,077
Can I ask you something, Ed?
You don't mind if I call you Ed, do you?

1045
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:49,744
Now that I'm out of your fucking high school.

1046
01:44:54,257 --> 01:44:57,124
- Does it ever work?
- What?

1047
01:44:57,193 --> 01:44:59,855
I really wanna know. Does it ever work,
or am I the first one?

1048
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:03,058
'Cause if I'm the first, I'm flattered,
but somehow I can't believe that.

1049
01:45:03,133 --> 01:45:07,331
Not after you fixing my grades.
And giving me your home phone number?

1050
01:45:07,404 --> 01:45:09,338
And then you come out here
when my parents aren't home.

1051
01:45:09,406 --> 01:45:13,001
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, you've got some balls.

1052
01:45:14,678 --> 01:45:16,771
Is this why your wife left you?

1053
01:45:24,654 --> 01:45:28,090
You must have really wanted to shake my hand.
Or something else.

1054
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:29,625
Now, wait a minute.
What are you...

1055
01:45:29,693 --> 01:45:32,753
Are you gonna tell people
I did something to you?

1056
01:45:32,829 --> 01:45:36,026
I don't wanna drag you down with me,
but I will.

1057
01:45:36,099 --> 01:45:38,693
- I'm better at this than you are.
- Better at what?

1058
01:45:38,768 --> 01:45:40,702
I'm trying to help you.
Can't you see that?

1059
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:43,204
- You've helped enough.
- Well, I won't just do nothing.

1060
01:45:43,273 --> 01:45:45,366
Well, you're gonna fucking have to!

1061
01:45:46,843 --> 01:45:49,641
- Still a flat line.
- Clear!

1062
01:45:49,713 --> 01:45:54,878
The things I'm gonna say,
they'll never go away.

1063
01:45:54,951 --> 01:45:56,942
Not for you.

1064
01:45:58,388 --> 01:46:00,322
Think of your job.

1065
01:46:02,525 --> 01:46:04,584
Think of your son.

1066
01:46:04,661 --> 01:46:05,758
<i>And clear!</i>

1067
01:46:20,744 --> 01:46:22,678
So, what's the story here, Ed?

1068
01:46:25,548 --> 01:46:27,072
Do we have a deal?

1069
01:46:33,656 --> 01:46:35,749
You can't do this.

1070
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:40,427
You have no idea what I can do.

1071
01:46:41,305 --> 01:47:41,159
