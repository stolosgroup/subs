<i>Please provide a status update
on the meters.</i>

5
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,140
Um, I don't know
what the fuck I'm looking at?

6
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,809
You know, I'm just
a maintenance technician, right?

7
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:17,511
For the entire galaxy.

8

<i>You are categorized
as low-level maintenance crew.</i>

00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:24,484
And when am I gonna get a...
an android up here?

10
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:27,788
<i>Are you feeling lonely?</i>

11
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,790
I'm alone.
I'm not lonely.

12
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:33,726
Anyway, robots are
awful company.

13
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,932
I just... I don't like
these spacewalks.

14

<i>An android companion
is not an approved expense.</i>

15
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:43,604
Um, can you really
put a value on human life?

16

<i>You were registered

$40 million.</i>

18
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:50,877
<i>Please get us
those readings STAT.</i>

19
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,512

24
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:10,498
Ground control,
what the hell just happened?

25
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:11,564

<i>Warning!</i>

27
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,670
Ground control, can you hear me?
Hello!

28
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:17,737
Hello!

29
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:21,809
Christ!

30
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:45,932
A lot of them are
strays, or turned in by owners

31
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,068
who can't take care
of them anymore.

32
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,305
I need one that has some
wine knowledge and won't spill.

33
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:53,606
My mom's
a bit particular.

34
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,909
What about these two?

35
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,912
This one is Charlie.

36
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:01,549
He's a fully operational
companion robot.

37
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:05,818
He served as an excellent end
of life caretaker for elders.

38
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:07,288
- He's great.
- Hm.

39
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,925
- Is his outfit changeable?
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

40
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,594
Do you want to get to know
Charlie in the meeting zone?

41
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:16,097
Hm, okay, yeah.

42
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,339
I'm super easygoing.

43
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:29,175
Comfortable
with any conversation topic.

44
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,178
You can't shock me, hm?

45
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:37,818
I can say "one more beer"
in over 48 languages.

46
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,587
Take me on holiday.

47
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,956
You're in
for a real treat.

48
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:43,957
Can he clean pools?

49
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,693
Actually, Charlie is a
little sensitive with water.

50
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:49,863
Oh, come on, Brian, I bet
you're no mermaid either.

51
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:53,933
I am great at doing
the dead-man float.

52
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,034
Am I right?

53
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:57,938
Uh, no. Can I please
meet the other one?

54
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,306
Let's take this outside.

55
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,875
So, so, you like wine?

56
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:05,044
Uh, my mom does.

57
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:06,981
Okay, listen to this.

58
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:10,917
What did the grape say when
it was being stepped on?

59
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,854
- Uh, I don't know?
- Nothing.

60
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,990
He just let out
a little wine.

61
00:05:17,424 --> 00:05:19,125
Huh? Am I right?

62
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:21,195
Am I right?

63
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:49,188
- What did she say about me, huh?
- It's a hard pass, Charlie.

64
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:52,859
It was the dead-man float
shtick, huh?

65
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:54,794
A little too dark, wasn't I?

66
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:57,164
I don't think
she's your type of crowd.

67
00:05:57,197 --> 00:05:59,400
You weren't made
for young ones like that.

68
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,769
I'm like a fine wine...

69
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:04,303
- complex but very, very fruity.
- Yeah.

70
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:06,339
That should be
plenty enough walking.

71
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:09,142
Okay,
it's bedtime, Charlie.

72
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:11,378
I need to go
get some rest.

73
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,247
Okay.

74
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:30,231
Close your eyes, Charlie.

75
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:04,964
He can cook.
He makes amazing desserts.

76
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:07,868
He's great
at small household tasks.

77
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:12,905
No, no, he can't fix
electrical equipment.

78
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:15,174
He's an older model,
he will fry.

79
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:16,976
But he's amazing.

80
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:21,782
No, I understand.

81
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:24,017
We'll call you
if we get one of those.

82
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:25,218
Yeah.

83
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,222
I see here you said
to not call, my bad.

84
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,824
Have a nice even...

85
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:32,325
Asshole.

86
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:52,845
Eva, engage thrusters.

87
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:57,283
- <i>Thrusters damaged.</i>
- Eva, engage thrusters.

88
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,518
- <i>Thrusters damaged.</i>
- Eva?

89
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:01,087
Ground control,
talk to me.

90
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:02,388
<i>Connection stream
interrupted.</i>

91
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:05,491
<i>Connection stream interrupted.</i>

92
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:06,625
Repeat that, please.

93
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,330
- Repeat.
- <i>Lost connection with com center.</i>

94
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:13,333
What do I do?
What's the protocol?

95
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,868
<i>Lost-lost-lost...
Lost connection...</i>

96
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,505
<i>Lost connection
with com center.</i>

97
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,875
- Sorry, repeat. Repeat...
- <i>Lost connection with com center.</i>

98
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:23,811
- <i>Lost connection with com center.</i>
- Fuck.

99
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:56,510
<i>Good morning, Claire.</i>

100
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,120
Can I please have my daily
inspirational quote?

101
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:09,990
<i>Of course, Claire.
Today's inspiration is...</i>

102
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:11,491
<i>"The best preparation
for tomorrow</i>

103
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:13,894
<i>is doing your best today."</i>

104
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:17,530
I like that.

105
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,933
Thank you, God.

106
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:37,417
<i>Claire,
I'm changing the music.</i>

107
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:40,186
<i>This is not conducive
to spiritual growth.</i>

108
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,522
Okay, thank you.

109
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:44,224
<i>You're welcome.</i>

110
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:26,198
<i>Hi, my name is Chad.
I'm 24 years old,</i>

111
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:29,035
<i>I love sports...</i>

112
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:36,342
<i>Hi, I'm Lauren,</i>

113
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,012
<i>and my best qualities
are not on the outside.</i>

114
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:45,118
Sinners.

115
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:49,523
I keep having bad thoughts.

116
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:51,557
<i>And what are they, Clair?</i>

117
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:54,126
I feel envious of Sarah,
and so I keep fantasizing

118
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,227
about her husband
cheating on her

119
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,432
and then she has to come home
and she goes crazy.

120
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:02,436
<i>Envy is the art of counting another's
blessings instead of your own.</i>

121
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,473
What are
my blessings, God?

122
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:13,948
<i>Um, my love for you,
and your wallpaper.</i>

123
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:46,679
<i>Claire, I heard that.</i>

124
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,647
Uh, heard what?

125
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,083
<i>You hit a car.</i>

126
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:53,352
No, I didn't.

127
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:56,689
<i>Lying. One sin recorded.</i>

128
00:11:56,722 --> 00:11:59,258
How many sins
have I committed this month?

129
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:02,696
<i>You are at nine
venial sins this month.</i>

130
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:07,066
<i>At ten sins, you will be
charged $25.99 per venial sin.</i>

131
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:10,570
Can I just remove
the last sin?

132
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:14,040
<i>To remove the most recent sin,
here are your options:</i>

133
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:16,242
<i>One, take responsibility.</i>

134
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,779
<i>End of options.</i>

135
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,015
Okay.

136
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:30,723
Thanks, God.

137
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:32,659
<i>You're welcome, Claire.</i>

138
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,200
<i>New update available.</i>

139
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:15,835
<i>New features...
future foresight,</i>

140
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:20,307
<i>communication with up to seven deceased
relatives and wireless compatibility.</i>

141
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,576
<i>To update overnight,
say "yes" at the tone.</i>

142
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:24,343
Yes.

143
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:08,654
So, Brian, you gonna
buy me dinner first,

144
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:11,290
or we just gonna get right to it?

145
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:15,529
Charlie, tell me, what do you
know about sex? Huh?

146
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:18,832
It's the motion of the ocean
that matters the most.

147
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:21,268
Am I right?

148
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,403
Yeah, you're right.

149
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,640
Are we doing
a full body scan again?

150
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:31,477
- We did one last week.
- Yeah, just one more.

151
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,813
Is it because of my highbrow
sense of humor

152
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,317
that's upsetting people?

153
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,853
Everyone's getting checked
again before the holidays.

154
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:42,588
Right. The holidays.

155
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:48,628
You spending them
with someone special?

156
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,397
No, not really.

157
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,365
You know, you should
just spend them here.

158
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,501
I'm great company.

159
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:58,972
Yeah, you're right.
That does sound nice, actually.

160
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:02,775
Would it be too much trouble
to dress up as Santa Claus?

161
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:05,377
Whatever you want,
Charlie.

162
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,313
- Let me help you.
- Oh, come on, Brian.

163
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:09,616
I never had Santa
as a child.

164
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,187
- You never were a child.
- Oh, good point.

165
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:18,658
Am I doing something wrong,
Brian?

166
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:21,428
You're doing
everything wrong.

167
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:24,564
Don't hold back.

168
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,768
I'm serious, though.

169
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,638
I've been in this place
for two months to the day.

170
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:36,677
I've never met anybody that was
here past the two-month mark.

171
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:41,548
You know, it would be nice

172
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:45,652
if somebody young
took me home that got me.

173
00:15:45,684 --> 00:15:46,919
You know, like you.

174
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,490
You can do
much better than me.

175
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:51,825
Better?

176
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:56,262
I don't wanna seem
needy, Brian.

177
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:59,031
But we get along great.
You're my friend.

178
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:00,366
Trust me,
you can do better.

179
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,901
You're my friend,
though, right?

180
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,871
Of course, Charlie,
I'm your friend.

181
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:09,676
Good.

182
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,347
Okay, lie down.

183
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,317
We have this new machine.

184
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:19,553
So lie down.

185
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,792
And you need
to close your eyes.

186
00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:28,694
Okay.

187
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:31,463
Can you play some music?

188
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:33,332
Sure.

189
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,637
Can you turn it up a bit?
I love that song.

190
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:40,073
Sure, buddy.

191
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,688
God?

192
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:14,767
God?

193
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:25,779
God!

194
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,584
Wake up.

195
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,928
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

196
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,632
God?

197
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:48,567
<i>God 2.0 customer service.</i>

198
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:51,470
<i>Please hold for the next
available operator.</i>

199
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:04,617
Oh!

200
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:11,090
<i>God 2.0 customer service.</i>

201
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:12,891

203
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:19,232
Hi, my name is Claire Larry,

204
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,068
and how do I find
the serial number?

205
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:23,236
<i>Can you request it from God?</i>

206
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:26,672
I can't.
He's not there.

207
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:28,741
<i>Oh, did you
recently do the update?</i>

208
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:31,010
- Yeah.
- <i>Ooh, well, that's not good.</i>

209
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:33,079
- Why, what does that mean?
- <i>Well, we've been having</i>

210
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:35,747
<i>some technical issues

211

<i>I'm afraid I can't help you
over the phone, Clark.</i>

212
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:42,020
Um, my name's Claire.
And my last name is Larry.

213
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:44,591
<i>Oh, okay, Larry.
I think the easiest way</i>

214
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:46,793
<i>is to make an appointment
with the Holy Genius Bar.</i>

215
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:03,743
What took you so long
to ask me out?

216
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:07,113
Mm, I don't know.

217
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:08,681
Just thought you
wouldn't be into it.

218
00:20:08,714 --> 00:20:10,717
I never said I was.

219
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:17,222
Hey, baby.

220
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:19,057
Say hi to the camera.

221
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:20,092
Hi.

222
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:23,595
What?
What should I do?

223
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:26,832
Um, whatever
your heart desires.

224
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:30,102
- Um, smoke rings.
- Oh, you can do smoke rings?

225
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:31,638
- Mm-hmm.
- Prove it.

226
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:39,646
Sick smoke rings, Anna.

227
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:41,680
They say perfect circles
don't exist,

228
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,983
- but you just proved them wrong, baby.
- Fuck.

229
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:47,019
By the way, totally worth
you looking a little gross.

230
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:50,857
I look gross.
Do I look gross?

231
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,092
- You're so beautiful.
- You're the worst.

232
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:56,530
Okay, stop.

233
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:08,707
Fuck.

234
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:01,093
You're still here.

235
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:15,942
Stop staring at me.

236
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,696
What the hell?

237
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:41,900
Come on.

238
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:50,375
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, you on your way?</i>

239
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:52,678
Yeah, I'm on my way,
you creep.

240
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:54,346
Suffocating me already.
Jesus.

241
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,748
- <i>You know that's why you love me.</i>
- Wait, wait, do you have wine?

242
00:22:56,782 --> 00:22:58,184
<i>Yes, I got a bottle
of red right here.</i>

243
00:22:58,217 --> 00:23:00,085
- Okay, I'll see you in five.
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>

244
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:25,078
God...

245
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,183
if you can hear me...
right now...

246
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:32,785
I'd, uh...

247
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:34,888
I really, uh...

248
00:23:36,121 --> 00:23:38,291
I don't know.
Shit.

249
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:41,194
Okay, all right,
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

250
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:42,262
Let me start again.

251
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:47,833
God?!

252
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:54,273
I-I never asked you
for anything.

253
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:55,374
Uh...

254
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:58,844
I've never even
spoken to you.

255
00:24:00,178 --> 00:24:01,980
Huh. I always figured

256
00:24:02,014 --> 00:24:04,883
the universe would,
you know,

257
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:08,487
lead me to wherever
I needed to be.

258
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:12,158
But, uh, I don't think
this is the right way.

259
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,427
<i>Recalculating route.</i>

260
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:16,394
<i>Insert new destination.</i>

261
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:19,466
Not now, Eva.
Jesus!

262
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:24,803
All right, well,
what's going on?

263
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,205
I mean, what am I...

264
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:28,807
What are we doing here, huh?

265
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:32,044
What-what's the lesson here?

266
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:35,380
What, that I'm selfish?
I already knew that.

267
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:38,117
I mean, like, what,
do I look like father material?

268
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:44,122
I mean, there's people
down there fucking.

269
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:47,860
They're fucking and they're murdering
each other, and you're coming after me?

270
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:50,028
You better get your
priorities straight, buster.

271
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:53,166
I mean, if you think
I deserve this...

272
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:58,371
well, maybe you should
have made me better.

273
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:02,040
I mean, this might
actually be your fault.

274
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:04,544
I mean, as far
as fathers go,

275
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:06,145
you're not very good either!

276
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:09,114
Either.

277
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:10,483
Shit.

278
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:38,077
I look gross?

279
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,111
Do I look gross?

280
00:25:41,313 --> 00:25:43,416
Is it bad?

281
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:45,250
You look beautiful.

282
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,522
- Sorry, it comes out every once in a while.
- That was not a goat.

283
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:53,092
That wasn't a goat?
What was it then?

284
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:54,426
That was a sheep.

285
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,294
Oh, you really know
your farm animals.

286
00:25:56,328 --> 00:26:00,399
Um, okay, what does a goat sound like?

287
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:02,134
Do it for me.

288
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:05,571
Ba-ha-ha.

289
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:08,940
That's a donkey,
that is not a goat at all.

290
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:12,979
- By the way, I just want to say...
- What?

291
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:15,514
I'm sorry
for getting you a burger.

292
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:17,851
- Why are you sorry for...
- Well, I should have gotten you hay.

293
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:44,009
Hey.

294
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:46,145
Hey, what's going on?

295
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:47,345
Come here.

296
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:50,515
This thing...
he follows me.

297
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:54,085
- Hey, it's okay.
- I see it all the time.

298
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,221
It's gonna be okay.

299
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:55,541
I have an appointment.

300
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:58,211
Yeah, I know.

301
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,188
- So?
- Mm...

302
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:14,659
Okay, so here's
the problem.

303
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:17,228
Never update without
doing a manual restart.

304
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:18,496
Oh, no, that's not true.
He just said,

305
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,833
"Say yes at the tone,"
and then he died.

306
00:29:20,865 --> 00:29:23,368
Did you hold down the button
till God shut down and restarted?

307
00:29:25,437 --> 00:29:28,407
- No.
- Okay then.

308
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:30,642
Oh, I see you pay for the cloud monthly

309
00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:33,579
so at least you have a backup
of your good deeds and sins.

310
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:36,715
Can you see my sins?

311
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:39,785
You want me to?

312
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:43,089
Okay, so moving on.

313
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:44,590
You back up every day, right?

314
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:47,293
Yeah, no, no,
I don't, sometimes, maybe.

315
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:50,795
Okay, what's going to happen is we can
offer you a discount on a new system.

316
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:52,565
How long have you been
with your current God?

317
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,368
- Four years.
- Wow.

318
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,871
Okay, you're supposed to renew
your faith every 18 months.

319
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:00,805
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

320
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,207
I'm surprised he stayed
with you this long.

321
00:30:06,344 --> 00:30:08,213
Just give me
a new model then.

322
00:30:11,283 --> 00:30:12,685
He'll be shipped to you
by tomorrow.

323
00:30:12,717 --> 00:30:14,219
How am I gonna pray?

324
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:19,158
You'll have to do it
manually.

325
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:30,236
God...

326
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:37,876
are you there?

327
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,715
Hello?

328
00:30:47,652 --> 00:30:49,521
God?

329
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:51,490
This is so stupid.

330
00:30:57,196 --> 00:30:59,198
Where are your parents?

331
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:11,744
God... Oh, shit.

332
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:14,846
<i>God 2.0 customer service.</i>

333
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,649
<i>This phone call
may be recorded.</i>

334
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:18,349
So, I've been
trying to pray manually

335
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:21,519
and, uh, nobody's answering.

336
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:25,623
So, I feel... kind of stupid,

337
00:31:25,657 --> 00:31:30,396
and I was just wondering
if maybe...

338
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:35,868
you could talk back to me
while I do it?

339
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,403
<i>Ma'am, we do not provide
spiritual responses</i>

340
00:31:38,437 --> 00:31:40,639
<i>to God 2.0 customers
over the phone.</i>

341
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:43,441
<i>I can sign you up for an
automated hotline service</i>

342
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:45,744
<i>for just a $199 per mont.</i>

343
00:31:45,776 --> 00:31:49,480
No, no, uh,
of course you don't.

344
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:50,882
That's... Just...
I actually was asking

345
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,717
just if you could
maybe do just quick response,

346
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,653
like, um,
just an inspirational quote,

347
00:31:54,686 --> 00:31:58,857
you know, "Best preparation
for tomorrow is..."

348
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,328
Or something about today
or just getting through.

349
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:03,829
<i>Uh, no.</i>

350
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:07,866
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.</i>

351
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:09,901
<i>Is there anything else
I can help you with?</i>

352
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:13,938
<i>Hello?</i>

353
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:15,941
<i>Hello, ma'am?</i>

354
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:09,661
<i>Buenos días, Larry.</i>

355
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:12,931
- Oh, God.
- <i>¿Inglés?</i>

356
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:16,368
- <i>Sí, sí, inglés.</i>
- <i>Good morning, Larry!</i>

357
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,971
<i>Congratulations for choosing God 2.0!
New and improved!</i>

358
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:23,074
<i>Wireless, waterproof,
non-flammable and simply indestructible.</i>

359

<i>Made exclusively

360
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:28,313
<i>God 2.0 is saving you
and the planet.</i>

361
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:30,481
<i>Larry, come on down
to Mattress Deluxe</i>

362
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:33,351
<i>where we have thousands of
mattresses at wholesale prices!</i>

363
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:35,520
Jesus fucking Christ.

364
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:39,024
<i>You used the Lord's name in vain.
One sin recorded.</i>

365
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,059
<i>You having trouble
gaining muscle mass?</i>

366
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:42,495
- No.
- <i>Of course you do!</i>

367
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:45,363
<i>Trainers are going out of
business because of protein water.</i>

368
00:33:45,397 --> 00:33:48,033
Make it stop.
Uh, stop ads, please.

369
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:51,569
<i>To stop advertisements,
sign up for Premium God 2.0.</i>

370
00:33:51,602 --> 00:33:55,106
<i>To roll your eyes at God is a sign of contempt.</i>

371
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,542
<i>One sin recorded.</i>

372
00:33:56,574 --> 00:33:59,711
- Can you see me?
- <i>Yes, I see everything.</i>

373
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:02,747
<i>The new God 2.0 is equipped
with visual sensor technology.</i>

374
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:08,086
- Shit.
- <i>Swearing. One sin recorded.</i>

375
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,456
Turn off.

376
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:13,492
<i>The new God 2.0
has an eternal battery life,</i>

377
00:34:13,525 --> 00:34:15,593
<i>and cannot be powered down.</i>

378
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:17,362
<i>Forever in your presence.</i>

379
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:21,566
<i>Making you
a better person, always.</i>

380
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:28,139
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

381
00:34:57,802 --> 00:35:00,138
<i>You know, I haven't been
back to this area since I was a kid.</i>

382
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:04,108
<i>There was a slight incident.</i>

383
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:08,381
There was some fireworks
and a friend's robot.

384
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:11,150
What happened?

385
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:16,822
I might have blown it up.

386
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:21,894
And I was never invited back,
you know,

387
00:35:21,927 --> 00:35:23,195
so I'm feeling
the pressure.

388
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:25,731
Okay, probably best not to
mention that at dinner tonight.

389
00:35:25,764 --> 00:35:27,032
No, you don't think
they'd like that?

390
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:28,867
- Probably not.
- Probably not.

391
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,668
I thought it'd make me a bit
dangerous, but whatever.

392
00:35:30,702 --> 00:35:33,639
I get it. I get it.

393
00:35:33,671 --> 00:35:36,608
But I'm serious,
I'm really nervous.

394
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,546
You know, I've never been
with someone of your kind.

395
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:43,048
What, someone so privileged,
and so self-loathing?

396
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:45,717
- Yeah, all my favorite parts about you.
- Hmm.

397
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:47,718
I was actually
having some doubts

398
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:50,555
- about you and I.
- Hey! That's mean.

399
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:52,657
I think it's a little odd

400
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:56,093
that you would use my childhood
sippy cup as an ashtray.

401
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:58,663
You... The childhood
sippy cup is odd.

402
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:00,631
- Who gave you the sippy cup?
- My mom.

403
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:03,201
It's exactly for that reason

404
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:05,838
I find the sippy cup
a little bit weird.

405
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,740
- It's sentimental.
- Do you not think that that's a reminder

406
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:12,878
of what it was like to attach
to the last...

407
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,816
I'm going to say it,
nipple-like thing in your life?

408
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:22,688
No, seriously.
Seriously.

409
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,823
Is she... is she going
to hate me?

410
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,058
Yeah.

411
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:30,963
- Really?
- Hm.

412
00:36:30,996 --> 00:36:33,198
- Is she really mean?
- Yeah.

413
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:36,668
Well, I'm really great.

414
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,836
So I'm going
to make this amazing.

415
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:40,038
She's going to love me.
Watch this.

416
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:45,243
So strange.
What a strange... house

417
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:47,845
Oh, is that...
is that...

418
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,581
Do you have a dog?
Is that...?

419
00:36:49,613 --> 00:36:52,150
- No.
- Do you think that's something on my shoe?

420
00:36:52,182 --> 00:36:55,521
- Look... Do you think that's dog poo?
- No, you look fine.

421
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:58,890
I cannot go into your house
smelling like dog shit.

422
00:36:58,923 --> 00:37:02,193
- Yeah.
- That's just a no-go.

423
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:04,530
This is so embarrassing.
Are you sure?

424
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:06,631
- Yeah, you're fine.
- Oh, I smell like poo.

425
00:37:06,664 --> 00:37:08,800
Ooh! The door opened.

426
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:10,668
- Where's your mom?
- <i>Hello, darling!</i>

427
00:37:10,702 --> 00:37:11,904
<i>Come on in.</i>

428
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:14,539
<i>Your father and sister
are in the game room.</i>

429
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:15,840
Oh, God.

430
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:26,617
- If you wanna watch the master.
- That's what I rolled.

431
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:28,220
See how it goes.

432
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:31,590
Take a nap,
he takes forever.

433
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:32,858
Yeah, thank you.

434
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:35,661
Watch, guys. Watch, guys.

435
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:38,630
- Yeah!
- No!

436
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:39,997
Oh, I'm so pumped.

437
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,933
- Wow.
- So gonna pl... I'm killing on this.

438
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:43,968
Looks like you built
a water park instead, Dad.

439
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:45,736
Don't tell your mother.

440
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:48,206
<i>Ron, I think
that's enough now.</i>

441
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:50,742
We should never have
installed a home optics system.

442
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:53,744
Word of advice.
Keep the home optic stuff to the bedroom,

443
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:55,948
- you don't need it for the whole house.
- Eww, Dad. Stop.

444
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:58,617
No, most accidents
happen in the bedroom.

445
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,619
So, you finally admit
that Olivia is an accident?

446
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:03,689
You're an accident, Liam.

447
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:04,823
Except you happened
in the living room.

448
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:08,794
- Wait, where?
- Ay, ay, ay.

449
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:10,029
Right, your go.

450
00:38:11,061 --> 00:38:12,764
No cheating
like your sister.

451
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,633
- Yes!
- Watch and weep.

452
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:20,905
Well, apparently mission
control lost contact with him.

453
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:24,109
You'd think they'd
just get robots to do it by now.

454
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:26,144
Why would anybody
go up there?

455
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:29,314
Sometimes you
just need some space.

456
00:38:30,782 --> 00:38:32,883
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

457
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:36,654
Nina, let him do it.
That's what he's programmed for.

458
00:38:36,688 --> 00:38:38,090
We just adopted him
a couple of days ago.

459
00:38:39,423 --> 00:38:42,827
We only rescue.
It's the best thing to do.

460
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,195
Why don't they rescue
the space guy?

461
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:47,198
The news said that rescue
mission is impossible.

462
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:49,934
I wonder
what he's thinking about.

463
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:52,638
Floating up there,
all by himself.

464
00:38:54,104 --> 00:38:57,208
Probably... nothing.

465
00:38:57,242 --> 00:38:58,910
I think that that's
the best part,

466
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:01,046
you can just shut off
the old computer.

467
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,148
So you wouldn't be
thinking about me then, Ron?

468
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,949
Well, of course, hon.

469
00:39:04,983 --> 00:39:09,354
By "nothing", I meant
nothing else but you.

470
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:10,789
- Good save.
- Thanks.

471
00:39:10,822 --> 00:39:12,157
No, I'm not buying it, Liam.

472
00:39:12,189 --> 00:39:14,693
I can't even
float alone through space

473
00:39:14,726 --> 00:39:16,061
without her telling me
what to do.

474
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:19,731
You know,
I think there's, uh,

475
00:39:19,764 --> 00:39:22,434
something poetic about floating
through space like that.

476
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:23,968
Why?

477
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:26,270
Well, 'cause you know
how it's gonna end.

478
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:28,173
What's poetic about dying?

479
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:31,943
Everything.

480
00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:34,079
It's so primitive to think

481
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:35,914
that the only way
a life has meaning

482
00:39:35,947 --> 00:39:37,916
is if you know
it's going to end.

483
00:39:37,948 --> 00:39:39,885
Um, not really, Mom.

484
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:42,820
I mean, not everyone is blessed
with the luxury of eternal life.

485
00:39:42,854 --> 00:39:44,456
Oh, I'm sorry.

486
00:39:44,488 --> 00:39:47,992
Should we be ashamed
of how blessed we are?

487
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:49,728
No, I just don't think

488
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,130
that we should rub it in
our guest's face.

489
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,965
Oh.

490
00:39:53,997 --> 00:39:55,300
I apologize, Nina.

491
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:58,003
I didn't mean to make you
feel uncomfortable.

492
00:39:58,035 --> 00:40:00,371
Oh...
Don't worry, I'm...

493
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:03,108
I'm not uncomfortable
at all.

494
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,776
I actually like being mortal.

495
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:07,379
See, not everyone
is dying not to die.

496
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:10,916
Sure. But I would assume
that given the choice,

497
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:13,952
anyone with a sane mind
would choose to go on living.

498
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:15,820
Well, I didn't have a choice.

499
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:21,092
I wasn't born in the
same tier group you were,

500
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:23,095
so I didn't get to choose.

501
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:25,764
But I'm okay with that.

502
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:30,302
But don't you feel like you're
missing out on so much time?

503
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:33,938
Well, I mean, time
just becomes more precious.

504
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:39,010
There we go
with the primitive thinking.

505
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:41,345
What's your issue?

506
00:40:41,378 --> 00:40:43,314
We, as a family,

507
00:40:43,347 --> 00:40:45,382
of course we're
really excited about Nina.

508
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:48,919
She's really lovely.

509
00:40:48,952 --> 00:40:52,423
- But, we do have some...
- Concerns.

510
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:57,027
- Concerns, yes.
- We have some concerns.

511
00:40:57,061 --> 00:40:59,264
All right, I mean,
I'd love to hear them.

512
00:41:05,436 --> 00:41:07,539
None? Nothing?

513
00:41:07,572 --> 00:41:10,876
Mom and Dad think you dating
a mortal is a waste of time.

514
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:13,244
I never said it
in those words.

515
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:15,881
Look, Nina, I-I think
you're very lovely.

516
00:41:15,914 --> 00:41:19,551
But we have to be
realistic here.

517
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:22,020
Well, I mean,

518
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:25,389
please, do tell us your
ultra-modern take on this, uh...

519
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,927
It's a big sacrifice

520
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:32,030
to waste time on something
that's going to end.

521
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:36,367
And especially when that end
is so heartbreaking.

522
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:37,969
No offense, Nina.

523
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:39,837
Oh, none taken.

524
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:43,108
She's going to get sick,
and then she will die.

525
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,043
Do you really need to be
around there for that, Liam?

526
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:48,880
Yeah.

527
00:41:48,912 --> 00:41:50,247
I love this woman,

528
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,084
so I want to spend
all the time I can with her.

529
00:41:54,452 --> 00:41:56,421
Don't you see
what you're doing, Nina?

530
00:41:56,454 --> 00:41:58,423
- Hold on.
- I'm not doing anything.

531
00:41:58,456 --> 00:42:01,059
You're dragging him
down with you.

532
00:42:01,092 --> 00:42:03,327
Why can't you find someone
of your own kind?

533
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,463
You know, uh...

534
00:42:06,298 --> 00:42:09,601
I wasn't planning
on telling you guys today.

535
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:10,936
But...

536
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:16,173
I've decided to die naturally
with Nina.

537
00:42:16,206 --> 00:42:18,976
Excuse me?

538
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,011
I'm turning it off.

539
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:23,147
I don't think so.

540
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,084
- What?
- I don't wanna live forever without you.

541
00:42:27,117 --> 00:42:29,453
That's crazy talk.

542
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:32,057
Why, just spend time
with her then.

543
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,126
- Don't kill yourself over it.
- I'm not killing myself.

544
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:37,863
Look, have your fun now,

545
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:40,465
and then, when she dies,
do a memory reset.

546
00:42:40,497 --> 00:42:43,133
Delete her.

547
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,902
That is so cold.

548
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:46,638
I'm a romantic too.

549
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:49,608
You've got so much more time and
accomplishments ahead of you.

550
00:42:52,577 --> 00:42:56,048
So I can what? Hmm?
Make more money?

551
00:42:57,381 --> 00:42:58,916
Then what?
Get another hobby?

552
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,086
Learn another language
I'm never gonna use?

553
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,322
When you can do
anything you want tomorrow,

554
00:43:04,354 --> 00:43:06,057
today doesn't really matter.

555
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,961
I made my decision.

556
00:43:12,262 --> 00:43:14,198
You know
you can't reverse this.

557
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:19,003
- Once you switch it off...
- Mm.

558
00:43:19,037 --> 00:43:21,907
...you'll be just like them,
like her.

559
00:43:25,008 --> 00:43:28,246
You'll age,
you'll get sick and then...

560
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:32,050
Liam, you know, I'd never
ask you to do this for me.

561
00:43:32,082 --> 00:43:33,418
It's my choice.

562
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,321
I'm not gonna
let this happen.

563
00:43:36,354 --> 00:43:39,524
Absolutely no way.

564
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:43,928
Well, you know, I think it's
about time I went for a cigarette.

565
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:46,297
Oh, great!
She smokes as well!

566
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:48,700
As if her life
wasn't short enough.

567
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:50,435
Okay, okay.

568
00:44:27,738 --> 00:44:29,006
<i>Hello?</i>

569
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:32,110
Anna, it's Ben.

570
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:35,412
<i>You're closer
than 50 yards.</i>

571
00:44:35,445 --> 00:44:38,749
- <i>Leave or I'm calling the cops again.</i>
- I just... I just wanna talk.

572
00:44:38,782 --> 00:44:40,651
Okay, I was trying to figure out
why you left that night and...

573
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:43,020
- <i>I left because...</i>
- I know, okay?

574
00:44:43,053 --> 00:44:46,124
- <i>You're that thing...</i>
- I realized I fucked up.

575
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:48,327
<i>I've been telling you to stop
coming here for months now.</i>

576
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:53,064
Please, Anna.

577
00:44:58,468 --> 00:45:00,271
<i>I'm coming down.</i>

578
00:45:20,057 --> 00:45:22,159
Ben, something is
really wrong with you.

579
00:45:22,193 --> 00:45:24,396
I know, I-I miss you.

580
00:45:26,564 --> 00:45:30,268
You stalked me using that
creepy virtual program.

581
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,735
You did this.

582
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:34,671
It was you,
in that fucking thing the whole time.

583
00:45:34,704 --> 00:45:38,108
No, Anna, no,
I-I didn't know.

584
00:45:38,142 --> 00:45:41,079
Okay, this is so fucked.
It's ruining my life too, you know.

585
00:45:43,747 --> 00:45:45,550
I wish I could
block you on it.

586
00:45:47,617 --> 00:45:48,619
No...

587
00:45:49,854 --> 00:45:51,122
No.

588
00:45:51,155 --> 00:45:52,590
No, you don't mean that.

589
00:45:52,622 --> 00:45:56,061
Ben, stop living
in my past.

590
00:45:57,494 --> 00:45:59,496
I don't wanna
see you again.

591
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,633
- Anna, it's our past.
- Ben, I'm telling you...

592
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:02,667
- Anna, please.
- Ben!

593
00:46:21,852 --> 00:46:23,555
Oh, fuck.

594
00:46:46,744 --> 00:46:50,515
Eva,
how much air do I got left?

595
00:46:50,548 --> 00:46:54,486
<i>You have six days,
11 hours and 34 minutes left.</i>

596
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:59,524
I'm losing my fucking mind.

597
00:47:02,626 --> 00:47:05,630
Eva, can I talk to you?

598
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,734
<i>David, I am detecting
a change in body temperature.</i>

599
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:12,303
Ah... okay.

600
00:47:13,738 --> 00:47:17,275
I should probably tell you
right now, um, I got a kid.

601
00:47:18,843 --> 00:47:22,280
My ex, she barely lets me
see her anyway, so...

602
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:26,485
Can I be honest with you?

603
00:47:27,852 --> 00:47:29,654
I-I didn't even want her.

604
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:34,325
I thought it would...
ruin everything, or...

605
00:47:35,726 --> 00:47:37,428
Not like I had
anything, but...

606
00:47:37,461 --> 00:47:39,731
that's the point,
you know?

607
00:47:39,764 --> 00:47:41,532
I like being alone.

608
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:46,337
Or at least I-I used to.

609
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:49,373
You know how this kid
looks at me?

610
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:52,744
<i>Like I am everything.</i>

611
00:47:56,613 --> 00:48:01,218
The thing I wanted the least
wants me the most.

612
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,823
I don't deserve that.

613
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:10,762
Nah, she's better off
without me.

614
00:48:12,796 --> 00:48:16,434
You know what?
I deserve this.

615
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:21,773
Hey, God, you're right.

616
00:48:21,805 --> 00:48:24,641
This makes perfect sense now.

617
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:27,345
<i>David, please repeat
your request.</i>

618
00:48:27,378 --> 00:48:30,914
<i>Memory storage almost full.
Deleting old files.</i>

619
00:48:30,947 --> 00:48:33,584
<i>Life support system unaffected.</i>

620
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:41,559
<i>A spokesperson
for NASA says that the satellite</i>

621
00:48:41,592 --> 00:48:44,595
<i>likely suffered damage
to its guidance control system</i>

622
00:48:44,628 --> 00:48:47,864
<i>during a standard inspection
and repairs operation.</i>

623
00:49:00,845 --> 00:49:03,014
<i>...performing routine
maintenance on the satellite</i>

624
00:49:03,046 --> 00:49:06,251
<i>was set to return to Earth
immediately.</i>

625
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:07,485
Where are my cigarettes?

626
00:49:10,021 --> 00:49:11,522
I don't know, Mom.

627
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:16,828
Where are you going, huh?

628
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,829
I told you.

629
00:49:18,863 --> 00:49:23,668
I'm spending the weekend
at Deb's house.

630
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,003
Why do you always
leave me alone?

631
00:49:26,037 --> 00:49:27,472
No, I don't.

632
00:49:32,075 --> 00:49:36,046
Your father left me.
Now, you're leaving me.

633
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,315
Everyone leaves me.

634
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:39,816
It's only
for the weekend, Mom.

635
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:42,853
Fine, go.

636
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:44,988
You don't give a shit
about your mama.

637
00:49:45,021 --> 00:49:47,592
No, that's not true.

638
00:49:50,561 --> 00:49:52,997
Leave me
like a lonely dog.

639
00:50:03,374 --> 00:50:05,043
I don't want you here.

640
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:11,916
Go.

641
00:50:16,454 --> 00:50:18,356
- Hey!
- What's up?

642
00:50:18,389 --> 00:50:20,791
Nothing,
it's my mom again.

643
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:02,534
<i>Welcome.
Unlocked.</i>

644
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:15,813
Hm.

645
00:51:41,905 --> 00:51:42,939
Hello.

646
00:51:42,972 --> 00:51:46,977
Uh, hi,
I was wondering, uh...

647
00:51:48,546 --> 00:51:50,814
Yes, yes, hi.

648
00:51:50,847 --> 00:51:56,787
Um, I saw, uh, the shampoo and
the conditioner in the bathroom,

649
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,757
and, uh, I was
just wondering maybe...

650
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:04,062
there was any body lotion
available?

651
00:52:08,932 --> 00:52:11,601
Just text my mom back
if she texts me, okay?

652
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:13,438
- And what if she calls?
- Don't pick up.

653
00:52:15,238 --> 00:52:17,441
How much are you
making on this?

654
00:52:17,474 --> 00:52:19,776
Enough to pay for my own
place for six months.

655
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:21,845
- Are you fucking serious?
- Yeah.

656
00:52:21,878 --> 00:52:24,848
What do you think
he's gonna do?

657
00:52:24,881 --> 00:52:27,552
I don't think he's gonna have
a quiet night at home.

658
00:52:27,584 --> 00:52:30,521
He told me to shave my pussy
and bring party dresses.

659
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:33,057
What if he does something
messed up with you?

660
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,593
I don't think
he's a psycho.

661
00:52:45,602 --> 00:52:46,905
Oh, fuck.

662
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:53,577
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

663
00:52:56,814 --> 00:52:59,150
Oh... Oh, for fuck's sake.

664
00:52:59,182 --> 00:53:00,083
No.

665
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,188
Oh, Jesus Christ.

666
00:53:10,927 --> 00:53:12,262
You people are gonna live
forever.

667
00:53:12,296 --> 00:53:15,166
Smoking is not gonna kill you.
Jesus!

668
00:53:37,555 --> 00:53:39,123
Liam?

669
00:53:39,155 --> 00:53:40,157
Liam?!

670
00:53:41,758 --> 00:53:43,126
What the...?

671
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:53,003
Liam?

672
00:53:54,637 --> 00:53:55,973
Liam?

673
00:54:00,744 --> 00:54:01,880
Liam?

674
00:54:07,117 --> 00:54:09,120
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

675
00:54:09,153 --> 00:54:11,822
Liam? Liam?

676
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:16,760
What?
Liam?

677
00:54:16,793 --> 00:54:19,996
Dora! Dora! Dora, stop!

678
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:26,169
Liam! Liam, no! No!

679
00:54:26,202 --> 00:54:29,606
Stop!
Dora, stop!

680
00:54:38,048 --> 00:54:40,051
Liam.

681
00:54:44,787 --> 00:54:46,090
Can I help you?

682
00:54:48,157 --> 00:54:50,727
Liam, Liam.

683
00:54:51,861 --> 00:54:52,930
I've been looking for you.

684
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:55,566
I've been looking for you.

685
00:54:58,302 --> 00:55:00,204
Hi, I'm Liam.

686
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:05,075
<i>Liam,
show this young lady out, please.</i>

687
00:55:05,108 --> 00:55:06,244
Can I help you?

688
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:10,148
<i>Good bye, Nina.</i>

689
00:55:37,374 --> 00:55:39,810
- Magda?
- Yes.

690
00:55:39,843 --> 00:55:41,012
Come in.

691
00:55:58,327 --> 00:56:00,864
I've prepared him now,
he's ready to go.

692
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:02,332
Strip down, please.

693
00:56:06,035 --> 00:56:09,206
Take off your clothes.
I need to prep you.

694
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:27,291
You are basically
just going to sleep

695
00:56:27,323 --> 00:56:30,327
while his mind
takes over your body.

696
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,164
He will be fully in control
of your motor functions.

697
00:56:35,765 --> 00:56:36,434
Um...

698
00:56:38,102 --> 00:56:41,072
Uh, what if he does
something very stupid

699
00:56:41,104 --> 00:56:43,206
and I get hurt?

700
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,842
What if I die?

701
00:56:50,347 --> 00:56:52,917
If you die, he dies.

702
00:56:53,983 --> 00:56:56,352
That would be unlikely.

703
00:56:56,385 --> 00:56:59,756
But remember,
you signed all paperwork.

704
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:01,726
So if he did something
to hurt you...

705
00:57:03,392 --> 00:57:05,963
it would cost him
a lot of money.

706
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,869
We've never had any cases

707
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:13,737
that things go
horribly wrong.

708
00:57:15,037 --> 00:57:16,840
You're just basically
taking a nap

709
00:57:16,874 --> 00:57:19,877
and waking up
a little richer.

710
00:57:21,845 --> 00:57:25,082
Okay.
Do it.

711
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:05,256
Hey.

712
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:06,758
Hey!

713
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:09,260
It's done.

714
00:58:30,847 --> 00:58:32,949
I smell so good.

715
00:58:32,983 --> 00:58:34,985
Hello. Hi!

716
00:58:38,588 --> 00:58:40,857
You will wake up
in 48 hours.

717
00:58:47,296 --> 00:58:50,133
Wait, are you not
taking my body somewhere?

718
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:52,803
You are your own
responsibility.

719
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:08,519
<i>You are not authorized.</i>

720
00:59:19,061 --> 00:59:21,030
Hi.

721
00:59:21,064 --> 00:59:24,101
Um, I can't seem
to get into my room.

722
00:59:25,501 --> 00:59:30,139
- And what room are you in?
- Three-five-three.

723
00:59:30,173 --> 00:59:32,043
All right, let me check.

724
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,016
It looks like there is
only one person on the room.

725
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:43,586
- Pawel...
- Pawel Novac.

726
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:47,023
It's my dad...
I guess.

727
00:59:48,325 --> 00:59:50,061
You guess?

728
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,496
It's my dad.

729
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:56,499
Okay, look,
I'm not supposed to let anyone in

730
00:59:56,532 --> 00:59:58,067
who's not on the list.

731
00:59:58,101 --> 01:00:01,939
But you don't look like
you're going to kill anyone.

732
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:10,981
If you need anything,
just let me know.

733
01:00:11,014 --> 01:00:12,082
Thanks.

734
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:13,177
Hmm, no.

735
01:01:13,209 --> 01:01:15,246
Definitely no.

736
01:01:20,517 --> 01:01:22,053
All right.

737
01:01:24,553 --> 01:01:26,222
Mm.

738
01:01:26,256 --> 01:01:27,391
Mm-hmm.

739
01:02:08,465 --> 01:02:10,133
- Hi.
- Hello.

740
01:02:12,202 --> 01:02:14,303
It's weird
weather, huh?

741
01:02:14,336 --> 01:02:15,338
Yeah.

742
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,209
Your, uh, daddy's out late.

743
01:02:21,378 --> 01:02:24,213
- What's happening?
- What do you mean?

744
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:26,483
I don't know, parties?

745
01:02:26,515 --> 01:02:29,119
It's late. You know,
everything's closing up.

746
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,490
Can I have a cigarette?

747
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:49,206
Though I do know
of a party.

748
01:02:49,238 --> 01:02:51,641
It's an after-hours type thing.
You don't need ID.

749
01:02:51,675 --> 01:02:54,711
But you don't really look
like the type of person

750
01:02:54,744 --> 01:02:58,215
- that might enjoy it.
- No, I wanna go.

751
01:02:58,247 --> 01:03:00,217
I'll tell you what,
I get off in half an hour.

752
01:03:00,249 --> 01:03:02,351
Why don't I take you?

753
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,863
And I've never felt...

754
01:03:13,896 --> 01:03:17,834
more alive my entire life.

755
01:03:22,238 --> 01:03:24,407
And I don't mean that
in a good way.

756
01:03:29,678 --> 01:03:33,650
Eva, new voice memo.

757
01:03:33,682 --> 01:03:35,585
<i>Voice recording initiated.</i>

758
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:38,655
So this next part's
not for you.

759
01:03:38,688 --> 01:03:40,356
It's for my daughter.

760
01:03:45,195 --> 01:03:46,197
Emma...

761
01:03:48,564 --> 01:03:49,733
Emma...

762
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:55,638
I've made sure that, uh,

763
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:58,409
all the stars
are shining for you...

764
01:03:59,675 --> 01:04:03,680
every night,
when you look up into the sky.

765
01:04:06,448 --> 01:04:09,352
I'm the space janitor, see,

766
01:04:09,385 --> 01:04:11,322
for the entire galaxy, so...

767
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:14,525
That's what I do.

768
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,465
Whenever you see
a star twinkling...

769
01:04:23,499 --> 01:04:27,704
that would me
just changing a bulb.

770
01:04:32,909 --> 01:04:34,811
I love you forever.

771
01:04:38,481 --> 01:04:42,319
- Eva, stop recording.
- <i>David, please repeat.</i>

772
01:04:43,753 --> 01:04:44,854
Eva?

773
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:47,690
<i>David, please repeat.</i>

774
01:04:47,724 --> 01:04:50,526
Oh, God, no.

775
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:53,296
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.

776
01:05:43,046 --> 01:05:44,281
<i>Do you believe
in God?</i>

777
01:05:46,715 --> 01:05:47,650
No.

778
01:05:49,586 --> 01:05:50,721
Me neither.

779
01:05:52,756 --> 01:05:54,458
I do believe
in goat people.

780
01:05:55,724 --> 01:05:57,560
Goat peeps.

781
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:01,698
<i>Stay tuned
for late breaking news.</i>

782
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:05,635
<i>And now following up</i>

783
01:06:05,668 --> 01:06:07,703
<i>on the new strain

01:06:07,736 --> 01:06:10,573
<i>that has been discovered

785
01:06:10,606 --> 01:06:15,845
<i>This is the third resurgence and mutation

786
01:06:15,878 --> 01:06:18,914
<i>The WHO has officially

788
01:06:21,084 --> 01:06:23,687

01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:30,493
<i>begun prepping for
another year of lockdown.</i>

792
01:06:30,526 --> 01:06:32,729
<i>There are reports of rioting and looting,</i>

793
01:06:32,762 --> 01:06:35,399
<i>and some governors have started
enacting serious measures</i>

794
01:06:35,432 --> 01:06:37,534
<i>by shutting down
state borders.</i>

795
01:06:37,566 --> 01:06:40,336
<i>This, combined with recent
outages in electricity...</i>

796
01:07:29,452 --> 01:07:30,387
You shy?

797
01:08:48,764 --> 01:08:51,700
Hey. You found
my little flower girl.

798
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:53,068
Oh, you know her?

799
01:08:53,102 --> 01:08:54,537
- Yeah.
- She's with me now.

800
01:08:54,571 --> 01:08:56,072
What?

801
01:08:56,104 --> 01:08:58,508
Lara, you're
fucking teasing me now.

802
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:01,143
Oh, don't be a dick,
Vincent.

803
01:09:01,177 --> 01:09:03,146
I'm just dancing.
I'm trying to have fun, you know.

804
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:05,582
Oh, shit.

805
01:09:05,615 --> 01:09:06,849
Can you get us a room?

806
01:09:06,883 --> 01:09:10,187
We're sold out, but, uh,
Magda has a room.

807
01:09:11,821 --> 01:09:13,857
- Uh...
- Come on.

808
01:09:21,897 --> 01:09:24,733
Come on, hurry up!
You don't have to hide a dead body.

809
01:09:27,603 --> 01:09:29,106
Just a minute.

810
01:09:34,777 --> 01:09:36,780
- Mm.
- Mm.

811
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,117
Uh-oh.

812
01:09:45,854 --> 01:09:48,592
- Ooh...
- Oh, wow, you're a dirty girl, huh.

813
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:50,627
- Hey! Don't! No, no!
- Hey, Lara,

814
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,229
yours is bigger, no?

815
01:09:52,262 --> 01:09:54,531
It's my dad's.

816
01:09:54,563 --> 01:09:56,532
Your dad's?

817
01:09:58,201 --> 01:09:59,970
Your dad's
a little pervert, huh?

818
01:10:00,003 --> 01:10:01,838
You should invite him
to the party.

819
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:05,007
Sounds like a real gentleman, you know?

820
01:10:06,276 --> 01:10:08,945
And what are you hiding
in your closet, Vincent?

821
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:10,881
- Nothing.
- Oh, really?

822
01:10:10,914 --> 01:10:12,948
Come on, so you have
a bag of dildos.

823
01:10:12,982 --> 01:10:15,619
Come on, have some fun.
Fun, fun!

824
01:10:15,652 --> 01:10:17,087
Come on.

825
01:10:22,058 --> 01:10:23,560
Take some of this.

826
01:10:26,295 --> 01:10:28,831
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Don't give her K, asshole.

827
01:10:28,865 --> 01:10:31,668
What? It's not K.

828
01:10:31,701 --> 01:10:33,203
I wanna try it.
Fuck it.

829
01:10:33,236 --> 01:10:34,638
See? That's the spirit.

830
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,874
Here. Here.

831
01:10:40,576 --> 01:10:41,644
Here.

832
01:10:45,814 --> 01:10:47,284
Oh, ho, ho, hey...

833
01:10:49,285 --> 01:10:50,320
Hey, leave her.

834
01:10:50,353 --> 01:10:52,789
She likes girls.

835
01:10:52,821 --> 01:10:53,823
So do I.

836
01:11:14,277 --> 01:11:16,813
I want... water.

837
01:11:16,845 --> 01:11:18,214
Please.

838
01:11:45,842 --> 01:11:47,710
Fuck!

839
01:11:51,347 --> 01:11:53,250
- Bitch!
- No, no...

840
01:12:21,443 --> 01:12:23,045
See what you
made me fucking do.

841
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:25,048
What the fuck?

842
01:12:26,749 --> 01:12:27,751
Just get out!

843
01:12:45,101 --> 01:12:47,304
You're fucking 17?

844
01:12:51,206 --> 01:12:52,142
Okay.

845
01:12:54,143 --> 01:12:56,279
Okay. Okay.

846
01:12:56,312 --> 01:12:58,180
Okay. It's gonna be okay.

847
01:12:58,214 --> 01:13:00,283
Yeah, yeah.
It's gonna be okay.

848
01:14:04,312 --> 01:14:06,215
Oh, my God.

849
01:14:28,237 --> 01:14:29,539
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

850
01:14:29,571 --> 01:14:31,907
<i>This is a national

<i>This is not a test.</i>

852
01:14:33,442 --> 01:14:35,979
<i>I repeat, this is not a test.</i>

853

<i>We urge all citizens...</i>

854
01:14:39,982 --> 01:14:43,153
<i>This is not a test.
I repeat, this is not a test.</i>

855
01:14:48,424 --> 01:14:50,293
Hey, you gotta pay for that!

856
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,396
Give me one!
I need to talk to God.

857
01:14:54,429 --> 01:14:57,332
Hey, it's not genuine,
I painted him last night.

858
01:14:57,366 --> 01:14:59,369
Good luck with your thoughts
and prayers, man.

859
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,916
Are you okay?

860
01:16:24,452 --> 01:16:26,156
Where are your parents?

861
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:31,628
What's your name,
sweetie?

862
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:36,298
- Emma.
- Let's go sit, okay?

863
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:31,588
<i>So this is how it ends.</i>

864
01:17:34,656 --> 01:17:38,126
<i>They say every end
is a new beginning,</i>

865
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,496
<i>but that ain't true.</i>

866
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:44,334
<i>People just say that
'cause they wanna feel better.</i>

867
01:17:44,366 --> 01:17:48,604
<i>It's easier to live in an
illusion than it is in reality.</i>

868
01:17:50,606 --> 01:17:54,143
<i>What is this thing
called "love" anyway?</i>

869
01:17:54,175 --> 01:17:56,079
<i>Did I ever give enough of it?</i>

870
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,082
<i>Does anyone?</i>

871
01:18:03,184 --> 01:18:06,155
<i>I thought everything
made sense,</i>

872
01:18:06,187 --> 01:18:08,657
<i>but none of this does now.</i>

873
01:18:10,326 --> 01:18:12,328
<i>I thought I was in control.</i>

874
01:18:12,361 --> 01:18:14,564
<i>But I'm not.</i>

875
01:18:17,299 --> 01:18:21,237
How the hell am I
the last man alive?

876
01:18:22,571 --> 01:18:25,008
How the hell
has that happened?

877
01:18:32,281 --> 01:18:34,017
Emma.

878
01:18:37,286 --> 01:18:40,423
<i>Recording interrupted.</i>

01:18:40,455 --> 01:18:43,659
<i>David, you have
run out of storage space.</i>

880
01:18:48,464 --> 01:18:50,533
<i>Last saved recording.</i>

881

<i>Whenever you see
a star twinkling...</i>

882
01:18:56,304 --> 01:19:00,376
<i>that would be me
just changing a bulb.</i>

883
01:19:04,513 --> 01:19:06,282
<i>I love you forever.</i>

884
01:19:07,482 --> 01:19:09,485
<i>I love you forever.</i>

885
01:19:10,553 --> 01:19:12,188
<i>I love you for...</i>

886
01:19:19,128 --> 01:19:21,130
I love you, too.

pretty hectic around here.</i>

890
01:19:57,732 --> 01:19:59,668
<i>But I'm here for you now.</i>

891
01:19:59,701 --> 01:20:02,371
<i>My child, how may I help you?</i>

892
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:06,576
Are you fucking kidding me?
