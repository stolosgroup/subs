00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:53,419
"Good morning, Columbus."

3
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:59,311
My mother's eternal words, reminding
me America was already discovered,

4
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:03,247
and that day-dreaming
was a long way from life's truths.

5
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:07,644
Why tell me the difference
between an apple and a bicycle?

6
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:11,632
If I bite a bicycle and ride an apple,
I'll know the difference.

7
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:16,077
But thinking about what to do made me
more tired than actually doing.

8
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,251
I remember my father said:
If you want to look at someone's soul,

9
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,749
you have to look at their dreams.

10
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,488
Then you'd have mercy for those
who swim in bigger shit than your own.

11
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,606
My name is Axel Blackmar, and I work
for the Department of Fish and Game.

12
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:35,766
Most people think I count fish,
but I don't.

13
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:40,425
I look at their souls, their dreams
and then I let them into my dreams.

14
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:45,516
People think fish are stupid, but they
aren't. They know when to be quiet,

15
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:50,298
It's people that are stupid. Fish know
everything, and don't need to think.

16
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:55,804
See, fish start out in small streams,
then I prepare them for the ocean.

17
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:59,599
When they're ready to die,
they return to where they came from.

18
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,954
That's my connection,
that's why I swam away to the city.

19
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,410
Okay, here's my job:

20
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,028
All I do
is temporarily electrocute the fish,

21
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:13,419
then with deep respect, I scoop 'em
and haul 'em in, one by one...

22
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:17,836
Sometimes I'll look into fish eyes
and I'll see my whole life.

23
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,387
It's something only fish can show us,
and I love 'em for it.

24
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:26,123
I tag the fish, measure 'em and weigh
'em, make sure they're doing okay.

25
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:31,556
If they want to talk, I always listen.
That's the job of a Fish God.

26
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,300
I've never caught a fish in a lie,

27
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:37,736
and I've never seen a fish
swim in the shit that human people do.

28
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,857
That's why I love my work,
and I love New York.

29
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:46,600
Not because my mother said it was
a place with real magnetic pull,

30
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,681
but because you can see everybody,
and nobody can see you.

31
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:59,944
Hey, honey! How are you?
How was Istanbul?

32
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:07,177
I'm looking for my girlfriend, Suzanne
Supak. I just spoke with her. Over.

33
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,997
I love you too, honey.

34
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:16,304
I miss you too, honey. Over.
Two more, please!

35
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:19,353
Pregnant? Wow! Over.

36
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:22,982
Listen, honey...

37
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:25,637
Alright, let's go.
- Have the abortion...

38
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,871
I'm not going.
- Come on! We're running late!

39
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:31,407
I said I'm not going.

40
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:36,744
You said you're not going?
- I said I'm not going.

41
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:39,531
I'm not going.
- You're not going?

42
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:42,997
Are you going to go or no?

43
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:48,555
Are you gonna shoot me?
- Am I? - You're going to kill me?

44
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:54,502
These things. I don't even...
It's a blank.

45
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:57,934
But I had you scared, right?

46
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:02,425
Let me feel.
You shit your pants.

47
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:12,697
"Take care of me"...
I'm fuckin' sick of it!

48
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:14,694
What?

49
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:18,747
He's your uncle, for Chrissakes.

50
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:23,865
If he wants to see me,
why did he send you?

51
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:27,111
You know it wasn't his fault, right?

52
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:31,506
I don't blame him for anything, Paul.
I never said it was his fault.

53
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:34,968
He's marrying,
and wants you as his best man.

54
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:40,752
You be his best man. - Why are you
like that? You're killing him!

55
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:47,342
Alright, Axel! Axel, listen.

56
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:50,174
End of story! Over!

57
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:55,350
I love you too!

58
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:59,979
I'm going to go back
and tell him I couldn't find you.

59
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,734
Really?
- Really. I have no choice.

60
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:07,326
Promise? - I promise.
What about a hug? No hug for me?

61
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,505
Axel, you smell like a scumbag!

62
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,207
I'm a happy scumbag. I got a nice
truck, a great job. - But you smell.

63
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,304
What're you gonna have?
- Two beers. - Two beers, OK.

64
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,924
And a ginger ale.
- Two beers and...

65
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:26,032
Forget the ginger ale.
Two beers and two shots. - Blanche?

66
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,354
Two...
- Who's the boss?

67
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,127
I am. - He is. 2 beers, 2 shots.
- And a ginger ale.

68
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,166
2 beers, 2 shots.

69
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:38,321
And a ginger ale. - Don't confuse her.
- A ginger ale please?

70
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:42,018
Anyway, Axel, I love you, but...

71
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:45,734
What? I love you too.
- Okay, well, you know... ginger ale.

72
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,979
That's right. 2 beers and 2 shots.
- And a ginger ale.

73
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,822
"2 beers and 2 shots." What's that?
What? - That thing...

74
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:57,373
What thing?
- Like a funny accent or something.

75
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:01,359
What funny accent thing?
- "2 beers and 2 shots." - What?

76
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:04,369
I dunno... like New York.

77
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:08,555
Funny New York accent, huh?
- Yeah.

78
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:13,783
Is De Niro funny? Is Pacino funny?
Is Rocky funny?

79
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:17,724
The great actors are all
from New York. - Sinatra?

80
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:21,512
Sinatra's from Hoboken, New Jersey.
Now let's toast.

81
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:25,889
Alright? It's been three years, OK?
- Three years.

82
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,817
To three years.
- Three years.

83
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,116
Blanche, ginger ale.

84
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:40,488
Two shots.

85
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:44,078
We don't see each other 3 years,
and you want ginger ale.

86
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:48,668
Thank you, Blanche. - Thanks for the
ginger ale. - You're welcome, boys.

87
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:01,042
Gimme a hug.
I'll plug my nose.

88
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,832
Back to the dream.

89
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:10,910
The man gives the stomach balloon
to the little boy.

90
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,967
Pushes him out of the igloo.

91
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:18,608
While the kid is outside,
the two inside start, y'know...

92
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,310
Alright! Stop yelling,
we're on Broadway. Show respect.

93
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:28,101
Therefore, I know you're all
dying for a piece of wedding cake...

94
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:32,181
So I will make this short and sweet.

95
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:35,723
Millie,

96
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:37,732
dear friends,

97
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:42,327
waiters and waitresses, I'd like to
propose this wedding toast...

98
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:45,766
Leo!
- Not now, Millie.

99
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,595
Come on!

100
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,813
Hey! Don't fuck around!

101
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:01,526
Cut it out!
Don't be a jerk! Cut it out!

102
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:08,237
I got an audition coming up!
You're lucky I don't kick your ass...

103
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:10,476
Cut it out! Axel!

104
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:13,829
You want me to come down?
- Come on down!

105
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:16,845
Stop shaking the ladder!
- Axel!

106
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:18,564
I'm coming down!
- Leo!

107
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,995
My boy!
- Axel!

108
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:22,943
I can't believe it!

109
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,750
You got big on me!

110
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:34,101
You heard about the wedding?
- I did. Congratulations.

111
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:39,120
I'd be proud if you'd be my best man.
- I gotta get back to New York.

112
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,729
Sure... Larry, we have to make
Axel an appointment for a fitting.

113
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,349
Honestly, Leo, I've got to go.

114
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,937
It's so good to see you, Axel.
You look terrific, Axel.

115
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:53,521
I just want to show you something.
I want to share this with you.

116
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:56,584
What do you think about my Saguro?

117
00:16:57,162 --> 00:16:59,118
The cactus?
- Nice, huh?

118
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,782
Let me let you in on a secret:

119
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:06,325
When a cactus is that young,
it is very vulnerable. That's why

120
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,953
I planted that Mesquite tree
right next to it, for protection.

121
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:14,780
If you don't see an older tree nearby
a new cactus, you can forget it.

122
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:16,906
It ain't gonna make it.

123
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,786
Come on inside.
Somebody's dyin' to meet you.

124
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:26,034
Millie! I'd like you to meet
my nephew Axel.

125
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,637
Axel, this is Millie.

126
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:32,169
How do you do?

127
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:41,028
Aren't you overdoing it just a little,
Millie? - Oh, sorry.

128
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,895
Come on, sit down next to me, Axel.

129
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:49,342
Lemme get a pair of pants on first...

130
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:58,966
Stop singing!
- I'm not singing. I count!

131
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,232
Count the stitches!

132
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:05,757
You've been on that jacket
for a week. Finish it!

133
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:08,542
Bye bye anybody...

134
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:24,076
Sorry for interrupting
you two, but I had to get my pants on.

135
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:29,428
Leo's told me so much about you.

136
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:33,915
I guess you know
I'm gonna be your new aunt.

137
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:40,266
You're his... fiancיe.

138
00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:42,078
Yeah.

139
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:49,887
You don't have to call me Aunt Mille,
though. Unless you want to.

140
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:56,825
How old are you?
- Twenty three.

141
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,251
We're almost the same age...

142
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,698
Isn't that funny?

143
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:14,504
Millie, please.
Remember we talked about this?

144
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:20,044
I'm sorry, Leo. Just a second.

145
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:25,815
Leo's trying to teach me
how to stop crying.

146
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:32,697
Sweetheart, go in the other room
and try on the other dress for Axel.

147
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,074
That'll get your mind off...

148
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:44,356
Go in the other room, sweetheart,
and try the other dress on.

149
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:51,017
It'll take your mind off crying.
It's in the other room!

150
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:57,527
I'm going.
- Do me the favor.

151
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,952
You know, Axel, my little Polish
cupcake is very sensitive...

152
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,068
...like the Eastern Europeans are.

153
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:25,366
But she's very nice, right?
- Very nice, Leo.

154
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:28,992
And you know how old she is?
- She's young.

155
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:31,399
Damn right. That's success.

156
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:35,938
To achieve that success, you need
to sell cars. - I don't want to.

157
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:42,443
Axel, my father had the first Cadillac
dealership in Arizona in 1914!

158
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:46,439
He had this magnificent dream,
to sell as many cars as he could,

159
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:51,115
and stack them up until they got high
enough so he could walk to the moon.

160
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:56,115
Isn't it beautiful? - Very beautiful,
Leo. But they'd topple over.

161
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,353
That's what I said,
but he wanted me in the business,

162
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:01,884
and I resisted,
like you're resisting me.

163
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:05,424
I'm not resisting, Leo.
I just don't want to sell cars.

164
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:09,091
What the hell are you afraid of?
- Nothing.

165
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:16,302
One thing I was sure of,

166
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:19,813
my uncle Leo was definitely
the hero of my childhood.

167
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:26,648
The smell of his "Old Spice" carried
me back more than the home movies did.

168
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:32,916
It was the sweet, cheap smell
of car dealers that took me back,

169
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:35,976
and made me dissolve into the past.

170
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:40,331
Leo was the last dinosaur
that smelled of cheap cologne.

171
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,678
And he believed in the American dream.

172
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,902
I was crazy about him,
because he believed in miracles.

173
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,671
Even though he lived inside
of life and sold Cadillacs,

174
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,547
he always looked like a 10-year-old
boy whose sleeves were too long.

175
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,306
Leo gave me this movie camera.

176
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,692
My mother always hoped
I'd become the next Milton Berle.

177
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:06,430
But dreams of houses, cars, and lawns
aren't dreams when they become real.

178
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:11,672
I understood what my mother
meant by "Good morning, Columbus."

179
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:16,962
Even if she didn't like what I was
doing, I think she'd understand me.

180
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,872
When I was 11, I got this really weird
earache that wouldn't go away.

181
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,263
A hundred doctors couldn't help me...

182
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:16,042
So Leo went into Mexico,

183
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,797
and brought back this fat lady
witch doctor who fixed me right up.

184
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:25,050
I was grateful, but I thought
I might've been better off mute.

185
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:28,415
All in all,
I had a very happy childhood.

186
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,518
My dad, a border guard, spent his life
trying to stop people crossing lines.

187
00:23:34,283 --> 00:23:38,561
For 15 years, he'd smooth down
the road between Mexico and Arizona,

188
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:42,593
and every morning he'd be out there
looking for footprints in the dirt.

189
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:46,085
But my father always said that work
was like a hat you put on your head.

190
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:51,424
And even without pants, you didn't
have to be ashamed of your ass.

191
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:55,447
One thing I was sure about:

192
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:59,818
The moment my parents died,
my childhood was gone forever.

193
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:04,974
Leo could never shake the guilt
of my parents' death 6 years ago.

194
00:24:05,853 --> 00:24:08,367
Leo was driving the car that night.

195
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:12,773
It got so bad that he even felt guilty
if he used too much shaving cream.

196
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:17,076
Four days after the funeral,
I caught a train to New York City.

197
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:22,464
If somebody asked me why I don't
take the next train back to New York,

198
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,792
it's because you can't say no
to your childhood hero.

199
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:29,489
I decided to be his best man,
but one thing I was sure of:

200
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:32,439
No matter how much I loved
the smell of cheap cologne,

201
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:37,440
I was never going to become my uncle,
and I would never sell Cadillacs.

202
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:47,208
Axel, if I died tomorrow,
where would you be?

203
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:01,936
You're not gonna die tomorrow.

204
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,050
Who knows when I'll die?

205
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:09,054
Your mother and father didn't.
- That was an accident.

206
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:12,894
No, it was stupidity. I shouldn't
have been behind that wheel.

207
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:15,933
Please, no guilt. Please.

208
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:22,294
Look,

209
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:27,829
I'm not going to allow you
to become a bum in New York.

210
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:33,243
I want you to stay here with me.
Try it for one week.

211
00:25:33,894 --> 00:25:37,045
If you don't like it,
then you go home.

212
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:39,478
Okay?

213
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:57,458
Axel, make "busy." Very, very busy.
- Hello.

214
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:01,167
Busy, but "willing to take time out
from your schedule," Axel.

215
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:09,423
Hello.

216
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:13,027
Axel, make "sexy."

217
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:23,884
Try it with your lips,
pucker them up..."Hello."

218
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:30,656
No,
more with the lips, you know, "Hello."

219
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:36,891
Axel, I'm a gorgeous woman,
and I have big, beautiful breasts.

220
00:26:37,494 --> 00:26:39,132
Now do "sexy."

221
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:43,675
No, Axel. Breasts.

222
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:03,528
You're talking art,
you're talking gravity.

223
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:14,211
You see this? - Yeah. Banana.
- Proteins, proteins...

224
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:18,374
Your organs
produce a certain amount of proteins.

225
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:23,024
Well, when you see a beautiful woman,
you produce extra proteins.

226
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:26,815
These extra proteins
go directly to your brain.

227
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:30,533
Where do you get all this stuff?
- Scientific fact.

228
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:34,358
Anyway, I've figured out a way
to make it work for me.

229
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:37,159
I call it "The Gaze."

230
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:40,185
You look into a woman's eyes,
and you think exactly

231
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:43,323
what you want her to do for you.

232
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:31,259
You're an actor?
Oh my God, he's an actor!

233
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:36,987
In 12 days, I have a gigantic
performance I'm doing in Tucson.

234
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:40,209
Maybe you'd like to come and see me?

235
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,173
It's an audition. - What have
we seen you in? Movies, TV shows?

236
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:51,098
Do you go to foreign films? - No.
- I'm a major star in Europe.

237
00:28:51,745 --> 00:28:53,098
Foreign films?

238
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:56,262
Yeah, foreign films.

239
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:12,143
Come here, close to me.

240
00:29:13,514 --> 00:29:15,311
Feel better now?

241
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,107
Feel better now?

242
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:24,409
You like that?
Don't touch my face, okay?

243
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:28,363
Oh, come on!
- No, I'm not kidding.

244
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:32,098
We can make love,
but don't touch my face or my hair.

245
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,488
Are all actors like that?
- All the great actors are.

246
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:42,521
Do you think anybody touches
Brando's face? Or Pacino's?

247
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:47,765
Do they touch De Niro's face?
Or fucking touch Johnny Depp's face?

248
00:29:48,423 --> 00:29:52,621
No one's gonna touch
Paul Leger's face, okay?

249
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:02,073
I'm missing my favorite scene...

250
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:06,120
I'm telling you, if I hear anything,
I swear I'm gonna kill somebody...

251
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:09,371
Go ahead and kill everybody!
You're the tough guy!

252
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:11,456
Kill Vicky, kill Salvy,

253
00:30:11,987 --> 00:30:13,943
Tommy Como, and me while you're at it!

254
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:17,925
You're killing yourself,
the way you eat, you fat fuck!

255
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:20,730
What do you mean "kill you"?

256
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:22,242
Me, kill me!

257
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:26,740
Start here! Do me a fuckin' favor!
- You meant something.

258
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,337
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
and you included you with them.

259
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:34,724
You could have said anybody,
but you said you and them.

260
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,704
You've let this girl ruin your life.

261
00:30:39,263 --> 00:30:41,094
She really did some job on you!

262
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,837
Look what she did to you!
- You fucked my wife.

263
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:46,664
You fucked my wife?

264
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:52,962
I'm not going to answer.
It's a sick question.

265
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:55,899
I'm gonna leave.

266
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:57,640
Very nice!

267
00:30:58,155 --> 00:31:01,830
You won't have troubles in your bed,
so don't pick it out on me!

268
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,597
Pig, pig, pig! Here!

269
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:53,931
Hello.
- Hello there.

270
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:57,473
Adrian Del Monica.
- How do you do?

271
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:06,746
I'm not seein' it.
- It's right in front of you!

272
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:12,543
Yeah, but the vibe...
It's all wrong.

273
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:23,334
Mine is a '66, and it's old!
I need a new one!

274
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,746
I'm not giving you any more.
500 dollars, that's it.

275
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,598
Are you listening to me?

276
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,674
Don't even think about this, Mother!

277
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:37,284
I can look if I want to.
- Get out! You cannot pay for this.

278
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,024
Yes I can!
- No you can't, Mother!

279
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,903
We made a deal, 500 dollars.
- I don't know, well...

280
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:48,100
How are you going to pay for this?
- With your money.

281
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,666
Which is half mine.
- You know what, Mother?

282
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,292
Fuck you! - Hello, Axel Blackmar.
- Fuck you, too!

283
00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:00,089
What a beautiful dress. - I didn't
come here for cheap compliments.

284
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:04,205
I wasn't complimenting you. Sorry.
Forgive me if I've offended you.

285
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:09,998
I'm sorry.
- You break, you pay! - No.

286
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:12,405
Something wrong with it?

287
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:19,292
Yeah, it's funny.
- Thank you. That's very nice.

288
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:23,871
Okay, right.
The undercoating looks pretty good.

289
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:26,795
The suspension is funny.

290
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:31,296
Look, the right wheel, see?
It's lower than the left. - It is.

291
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:33,118
It's true.

292
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:37,388
I didn't mean to insult. I just wanted
to tell you how beautiful you look.

293
00:33:38,014 --> 00:33:40,926
Are you going to sell me a car or not?
- Yes.

294
00:33:41,516 --> 00:33:43,188
Hello, Elaine.
- Hi!

295
00:33:43,726 --> 00:33:46,001
I didn't know you worked here.
- Temporary.

296
00:33:46,562 --> 00:33:49,474
Can you hold on a sec?
I'll be right with you.

297
00:33:50,693 --> 00:33:53,765
Keep the daughter busy.
- No. She's my first customer.

298
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:57,036
The woman knows my face.
It's better for the sale.

299
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:01,210
It's better if I do it!
- Don't ever touch my suit.

300
00:34:01,827 --> 00:34:04,785
Do me a favor,
keep the daughter busy.

301
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:09,005
Elaine, do you want to step outside?
- Sure.

302
00:34:10,793 --> 00:34:13,865
Why's he looking at me like that?
- Oh, he's a kid. He's...

303
00:34:24,514 --> 00:34:26,391
You ever think about suicide?

304
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:29,163
Excuse me?
- Suicide.

305
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,925
Not recently.

306
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:36,940
I think about it all the time.
I want to come back as a turtle.

307
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:40,745
Turtles are very nice.
- Yes, they're the best.

308
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:48,011
She's not my real mother.
She married my father. He's dead.

309
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:53,543
Both my parents are dead.
- You sure become your parents.

310
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:58,400
Even if they're not your real parents.
I'm gonna kill myself before that.

311
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:02,721
Really? - Yup.
- Do you think you're overreacting?

312
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:09,804
I don't have another match.

313
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:13,493
Look at my hands!
These aren't my hands.

314
00:35:14,062 --> 00:35:15,620
These are her hands.

315
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,869
Do you like my legs?
I hate them!

316
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:22,902
Sometimes I'll be sitting,

317
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:26,356
and I'll look down,
and they're crossed just like hers.

318
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:30,338
She does have nice legs.
- Yes, she does.

319
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:34,058
What's so bad
about becoming your mother?

320
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:37,899
Just wait. One day you'll wake up,
and you'll be your father.

321
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:42,158
Wrong. My uncle is my only family.
- What does he do?

322
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:45,507
He owns this place.
- See what I mean?

323
00:35:46,716 --> 00:35:50,265
My father owned the 3rd largest
copper mine in Arizona.

324
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:54,005
Now I own the 3rd largest
copper mine in Arizona.

325
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:57,795
You're an idiot if you think
you can escape it.

326
00:35:58,394 --> 00:36:00,385
Don't call me an idiot.

327
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,629
Look, man...

328
00:36:06,152 --> 00:36:07,904
I gave you pazzazz,

329
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:10,913
I offered you excitement,
vibes,

330
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:13,207
sexy good-looking,

331
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:18,532
I even gave you Waaaaaagaaanganngg!
What else could you want in a car?

332
00:36:19,204 --> 00:36:21,718
Good gas mileage. That's important.

333
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,817
Mr. Del Monica, look at my lips.

334
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,183
They're gonna say:

335
00:36:27,714 --> 00:36:32,834
Take your whsshht and get off my lot,
before I punch you!

336
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:34,703
Now git!

337
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:37,276
Are you sore?
- Out! Out!

338
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:47,255
Buy a Ford!

339
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:51,330
It's disgusting.
Isn't it disgusting?

340
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:54,261
Goodbye, chickenhead.
- Axel.

341
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:58,451
Hey Elaine, I was wondering...
I know we just met,

342
00:36:59,075 --> 00:37:04,593
but I was wondering if the two of us
could meet for a picnic or a soirיe?

343
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,043
I don't think so.
Goodbye, Paul.

344
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:18,738
What the fuck was that? - What?
- I was waiting for that woman.

345
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:22,620
Why was the door locked?
- She was making a phone call.

346
00:37:23,223 --> 00:37:24,292
Really?

347
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,448
Gentlemen, new showroom policy:
As of today,

348
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,978
if any customers
come in dressed casually,

349
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:35,683
they're yours. Starting now.
Clear the area.

350
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,882
Did you know
that the warriors in Papua New Guinea

351
00:37:49,456 --> 00:37:51,845
avoid eating turtle meat before battle?

352
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:55,136
They believe
that turtles are very shy,

353
00:37:55,712 --> 00:37:57,384
and if they eat the meat,

354
00:37:57,922 --> 00:38:00,834
their enemies will become shy,
and run away.

355
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:05,569
Did you know that?
- Well, it is fascinating.

356
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,731
A Papua New Guinea story!
- It's "Papua." - I don't give a shit!

357
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:17,548
Wait! Isn't that the place where the
village boys go into the woods,

358
00:38:18,274 --> 00:38:24,873
and they build a giant lean-to...
a shack. - That's right!

359
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:29,005
Then they take a woman
they've captured from another village,

360
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,258
and they put her inside the lean-to.

361
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:36,382
And then every boy in the village
goes in to lose his virginity.

362
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:42,322
When the last boy in line is inside,
the rest go to the shack and knock...

363
00:38:43,006 --> 00:38:44,758
You know the rest?
- Yes.

364
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:47,212
Why do they knock it down?

365
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:52,277
Because they eat the poor bastard
who was last, and the girl.

366
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,809
Nice.
- But they're natives. Natives.

367
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,460
Oops! I've lost my napkin!

368
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,838
There's plenty of room here.
Why don't you move apart?

369
00:39:54,448 --> 00:39:56,120
We're fine.

370
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:58,058
Grace!

371
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:04,375
Axel, tell them the Eskimo movie
dream thing. - Why don't you, Paul?

372
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,831
Well, I'd love to hear it!

373
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:09,766
Oh yes!
My mother loves bed-time stories.

374
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:11,782
Go on, Axel.

375
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:16,527
This Eskimo, Dooey, is fishing...

376
00:40:17,637 --> 00:40:21,312
through a hole in the ice,
and he catches this fish

377
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,564
with both eyes on the same side
of its head. - I'm sorry.

378
00:40:26,186 --> 00:40:30,145
But is that a real fish?
- Yes, it's a real fish.

379
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:32,968
And there's a storm coming,

380
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:37,804
so Dooey gets on his dog sled,
and travels through the ice.

381
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:39,563
Stop!

382
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:42,030
Grow up! Mother, now!
- Mind your own business!

383
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:46,092
...he builds a fire,
and the snow from the tree falls down

384
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,821
and puts the fire out.
- Jesus.

385
00:40:49,374 --> 00:40:51,285
Sweetheart, go play.

386
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,472
Is that it?
- No. So now Dooey is dying,

387
00:40:57,965 --> 00:40:59,842
and his dog hypnotizes him,

388
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:02,581
and brings him back to the igloo,

389
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:05,050
where his wife rubs

390
00:41:05,598 --> 00:41:09,716
his body with a sponge,
and brings him back to life.

391
00:41:14,189 --> 00:41:15,144
That's beautiful.

392
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,378
It is beautiful.

393
00:41:30,496 --> 00:41:34,887
What was that?
- My hand slipped. - A kid.

394
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:37,591
A kid. Beautiful.

395
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:51,090
It must give you great pleasure
to be the life of the party, Mother.

396
00:41:51,682 --> 00:41:52,751
What party?

397
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:55,781
Why must you try to screw

398
00:41:56,354 --> 00:41:58,231
every man you see under 30?
- Grace,

399
00:41:58,772 --> 00:42:01,411
in Papua New Guinea, it's
considered a right of passage...

400
00:42:01,983 --> 00:42:04,338
I don't want to hear it!

401
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:09,146
In Papua New Guinea,
if a woman wants to go to bed

402
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:12,173
with a young man, she can.
- Stop it!

403
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:14,255
If she's older, it's okay!

404
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:19,304
If you fucking say it one more time,
I'm going to smash this table now!

405
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:24,740
Let go!

406
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:55,114
Paul, maybe we should go...
- Sit down! - Go!

407
00:42:55,702 --> 00:42:57,055
Sit.
- Go!

408
00:42:57,706 --> 00:43:01,176
No! You're not invited! Go!
- Sit!

409
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,987
I think we should stay here tonight.
- No! You're not invited!

410
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:07,541
My friends can stay if they want.

411
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:11,966
You are disgusting. An immature girl
in a sagging, old body!

412
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:16,551
You're a pale imitation of a young me.
- Except I didn't kill my husband!

413
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:19,092
Tell your fucking new friends

414
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,871
what that's like! - Shut up!
- No, you go ahead!

415
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:24,511
Shut up, Grace!

416
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,094
You're disgusting! - Shut up!
- No, 'cuz I said it!

417
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,199
If it hadn't been for you,
he'd still be alive!

418
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,695
Fuck.

419
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,369
That's it.
I'm gonna kill myself right now.

420
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,718
Okay, good.

421
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,736
Go ahead!
I'll give you a nice funeral.

422
00:43:59,177 --> 00:44:04,615
I'm sure you will. But you're
not getting any of my money!

423
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:08,105
I don't care. What else is new?

424
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:11,287
Look, Mom! See?

425
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,669
She's taking down her panty hose.

426
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:18,583
I'm so glad I'll be dead for your
birthday! - Your best present ever!

427
00:44:19,237 --> 00:44:20,875
This is it, Mom! Goodbye!

428
00:44:29,122 --> 00:44:30,271
Get away!

429
00:44:34,293 --> 00:44:35,692
Look, Mom!

430
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:38,441
She has her panties around her neck!

431
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:40,294
I'm eating!

432
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:43,188
You're desperate and sick, Mom.

433
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:48,435
You're sick. I can't live this way.
I don't want to live this way.

434
00:44:49,098 --> 00:44:52,568
Why don't you have some dignity?
- I'm not living this way.

435
00:44:54,187 --> 00:44:56,496
What do you want me to do?
- No, this is good.

436
00:44:57,064 --> 00:45:00,261
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him!

437
00:45:01,234 --> 00:45:04,590
Mom! - You didn't have to hit me,
did you? Is my nose bleeding?

438
00:45:05,864 --> 00:45:07,092
Grace, please don't.

439
00:45:07,615 --> 00:45:10,288
Why aren't you looking, Mom?

440
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:12,541
I'm a failure!

441
00:45:13,372 --> 00:45:16,921
I won't live this way.
- I've been incorrigible.

442
00:45:17,543 --> 00:45:20,421
Mom, you made me do this.
- Stop this!

443
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:24,742
Fuck yourself!
- Paul! Shut up! ...cowardly lion.

444
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:28,192
Grace, I'll never say it again.

445
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,756
Liar!
- No! I promise!

446
00:45:32,347 --> 00:45:34,099
You promise what?
- Never to say "Papua..."

447
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:36,633
You're so evil, Mother!

448
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:02,315
It's okay...

449
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:06,660
I'll fight you standing on one foot,

450
00:46:07,254 --> 00:46:08,972
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!

451
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:11,783
Elaine!

452
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:18,508
You know when you're
just about to go to sleep,

453
00:46:19,098 --> 00:46:22,454
or you're just sort of,
you know, falling asleep...

454
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:26,576
and you think you're really falling,
so you catch yourself?

455
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,655
That ever happen to you? You're
not falling, just falling asleep.

456
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:34,436
There you go.

457
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,384
When I was a little girl,

458
00:46:40,536 --> 00:46:42,731
I always wanted to fly.

459
00:46:44,122 --> 00:46:45,475
From the top of the house.

460
00:46:47,545 --> 00:46:49,536
At night, I'd close my eyes,

461
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,253
and imagine I was on the roof,

462
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,071
looking down at my parents
in their bed.

463
00:46:58,427 --> 00:47:00,258
And then I'd jump off...

464
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,398
and I'd fly...

465
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:08,535
While everyone was sleeping,

466
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:12,551
I'd be soaring around,

467
00:47:16,736 --> 00:47:19,011
looking through their windows,

468
00:47:20,614 --> 00:47:21,967
flying...

469
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:28,383
and resting in the trees.

470
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:33,476
I always knew I could,

471
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,195
but I never told them.

472
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:43,117
Once someone knows,
they can make you fall.

473
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:55,648
After I'm big,
I may start acting weird,

474
00:47:56,231 --> 00:47:58,984
stop returning calls,
dressing all in black,

475
00:47:59,568 --> 00:48:01,445
fancy restaurants, the whole shtick.

476
00:48:01,986 --> 00:48:03,942
I want you to keep me in perspective.

477
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:08,403
Paul, you already wear black.
- You know what I mean.

478
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:12,006
I just can't
become a slave to my success.

479
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:16,574
I have to stay myself.
- I think she likes me.

480
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:20,527
Did you see how she looked in my eyes?
- The great Paul Leger!

481
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,088
I started thinking
about Paul's garbage theory, about

482
00:48:24,676 --> 00:48:27,474
male organs making extra proteins
when a beautiful woman looks at you.

483
00:48:28,554 --> 00:48:31,148
And if she keeps on looking,
they produce

484
00:48:31,723 --> 00:48:36,160
an extra protein, so deadly
that one drop on the tip of an arrow

485
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:40,008
could kill
a fucking rhino in 2 seconds.

486
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:44,029
I started to think
what I wanted her to think,

487
00:48:44,944 --> 00:48:46,696
I looked in her eyes,

488
00:48:47,864 --> 00:48:49,013
and bingo!

489
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:55,411
She was mine.

490
00:48:56,913 --> 00:48:59,666
Paul swears that
cavemen used this deadly technique,

491
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:04,243
and that the deadly male protein
killed the dinosaurs, not the ice age.

492
00:49:04,879 --> 00:49:08,110
I think he saw it in a movie,
and convinced himself it was true.

493
00:49:08,716 --> 00:49:10,786
That's how Paul escaped.

494
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:14,142
And that's just what he did
the next day.

495
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:17,110
I never paid much attention
to Paul's garbage theories.

496
00:49:17,683 --> 00:49:19,958
But then I realized he was right.

497
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:24,717
I felt the proteins running through
my body like broken glass.

498
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,590
I tried to keep the proteins busy
by making flying machines.

499
00:49:30,237 --> 00:49:33,149
I've never built
a flying machine before.

500
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:36,776
The proteins
were making things fly in my head.

501
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:40,962
The more I worked on it,
the more I was sure it would fly.

502
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,333
I just kept telling myself:
It's gonna fly.

503
00:49:47,461 --> 00:49:50,021
Love hit me like an elephant,

504
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,708
and I was thrown
into a jungle of dreams.

505
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:58,055
Mother was wrong about magnetic pulls.
There was only one pull,

506
00:49:58,678 --> 00:50:00,475
and she was lying on my back.

507
00:50:01,556 --> 00:50:05,185
I wasn't "falling in love,"
because I never felt any weight,

508
00:50:05,979 --> 00:50:09,767
because I was "flying in love,"
for the first time in my life.

509
00:51:06,952 --> 00:51:09,341
Beautiful morning out, isn't it?

510
00:51:10,454 --> 00:51:11,807
Yes, it is.

511
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:17,277
Sit down. I'll do this.

512
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,200
Cereal? - Huh?
- Cereal?

513
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:26,705
Sure.

514
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:41,538
I made some coffee for you.
- Great, thanks.

515
00:51:42,151 --> 00:51:44,460
Did you fuck her?

516
00:51:45,029 --> 00:51:46,906
What?

517
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:51,710
My mother. Did you fuck her?

518
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:55,116
No.

519
00:52:05,341 --> 00:52:09,254
You liar! I can smell her on you.

520
00:52:14,389 --> 00:52:17,347
You're not the first,
did you know that?

521
00:52:22,815 --> 00:52:24,771
Could I have some milk?

522
00:52:31,905 --> 00:52:35,739
She's had a lot of young ones
like you, eats you up like chocolates.

523
00:52:36,368 --> 00:52:40,680
Could I have a spoon?
- When she finishes a whole box,

524
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:49,696
she sticks her finger
down her throat, and it comes back up.

525
00:52:53,092 --> 00:52:57,643
You must have done well in school.
- Straight A's.

526
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,914
Food!
- Good!

527
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:56,344
Food! Hungry!

528
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:59,497
I'm kind of hungry.
- Hungry!

529
00:54:02,992 --> 00:54:06,541
Very good.
- Good... Thirsty? Yes.

530
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:01,403
Two... one... go!

531
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:23,840
Almost!

532
00:55:31,324 --> 00:55:35,237
You ever thought about leaving?
- Only a million times.

533
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:40,700
Why don't you?
- Soon I'm going to Papua New Guinea.

534
00:55:43,461 --> 00:55:47,340
Ever thought about Alaska?
- Why would I go there?

535
00:55:47,963 --> 00:55:50,431
It's very beautiful.

536
00:55:51,009 --> 00:55:56,288
In my dream, y'know, the movie dream?
There was a place on the Bering Sea.

537
00:55:56,974 --> 00:56:00,171
It's completely flat, and really,
really quiet, y'know?

538
00:56:01,311 --> 00:56:05,384
Not even the wind whistling,
because there's nothing there.

539
00:56:06,022 --> 00:56:07,978
And then there's a boat,

540
00:56:09,234 --> 00:56:10,792
and then...

541
00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:15,248
there's the Eskimos.
- The Eskimos!

542
00:56:15,824 --> 00:56:21,296
The Eskimos push their old people out
on ice floes to die! - No!

543
00:56:21,996 --> 00:56:25,989
They don't do that! Elaine, I was
trying to tell you the other night.

544
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:30,333
Eskimos believe that,
even though you die,

545
00:56:30,962 --> 00:56:32,680
you're never really

546
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:34,614
dead.

547
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:36,628
What then?

548
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:40,851
You're... infinity.

549
00:56:41,973 --> 00:56:45,522
They believe that when
the physical suit of skin dies,

550
00:56:46,142 --> 00:56:49,612
it becomes part of the earth,
but your soul...

551
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,028
keeps going, into other things...

552
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:56,248
like trees...

553
00:56:56,821 --> 00:56:59,415
or fish or rocks...

554
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:03,870
or even other people, who actually
are at that point, you.

555
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,997
And if you don't like what you became?

556
00:57:12,753 --> 00:57:13,708
Shit!

557
00:57:15,045 --> 00:57:17,878
You wait a few years,
and then you turn into something else.

558
00:57:18,466 --> 00:57:21,663
And love works the same way...

559
00:57:22,261 --> 00:57:26,254
So like, if you and I
went down in a plane crash,

560
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:30,803
that would be okay,
because our souls would keep going.

561
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:35,136
And we'd love each other
over and over, from place to place,

562
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:38,529
because it's infinity.

563
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:43,403
And you want to go there with me?
- Yeah.

564
00:57:45,616 --> 00:57:50,167
We would love each other
over and over, for infinity.

565
00:57:51,455 --> 00:57:52,410
Elaine,

566
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:59,013
we'll go to the Bering Sea,
we'll be in love, and we'll never die.

567
00:57:59,713 --> 00:58:03,831
Never die. We can leave tomorrow,
or we can leave right now.

568
00:58:05,093 --> 00:58:06,526
Okay.

569
00:58:29,616 --> 00:58:34,087
I hope we're not disturbing.
- What are you doing here, Leo?

570
00:58:34,746 --> 00:58:37,465
Axel, is that how you say hello?
- Just hold it.

571
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,157
Mrs. Stalker, nice seeing you again.
Axel, get your things,

572
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:45,461
and we can get going.
- I'm not going anywhere, Leo.

573
00:58:46,214 --> 00:58:49,684
I bet you're gonna come.
- Paul, hold it. - Alright.

574
00:58:50,302 --> 00:58:55,820
Mrs. Stalker, if we could
just be privately for a moment?

575
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,855
Yes.

576
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:19,273
So you're working on the old airplane?
- Don't touch it! - I'm sorry.

577
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:25,722
It's great! Great.

578
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:31,242
You should be with your sick uncle,
instead of playing with this nutcase.

579
00:59:31,925 --> 00:59:34,917
You know, this whole airplane...
- What did you say?

580
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,980
You know what this is for her?
This is like a prescription.

581
00:59:39,597 --> 00:59:44,068
The name you called her!
- Oh, I called her a name? - Yes.

582
00:59:44,728 --> 00:59:49,404
What did I call her? Can't remember.
I think I called her... psycho!

583
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:52,820
Psychopath!
When are you gonna get it, Axel?

584
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:02,995
Nothing like freshly brewed coffee.
- It's instant.

585
01:00:05,163 --> 01:00:07,472
I knew that, Mrs. Stalker.

586
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,238
I don't like conflict. - No one said
you did, Mr. Smilie. - Sweetie.

587
01:00:12,879 --> 01:00:15,951
I know no one said that I did.

588
01:00:17,424 --> 01:00:21,702
But we should get down to business.
- We don't have any, Mr. Smilie.

589
01:00:22,344 --> 01:00:24,380
Sweetie. Try that.

590
01:00:26,808 --> 01:00:31,279
Very nice. We do have business.
I want him returned to me.

591
01:00:33,107 --> 01:00:36,144
He's a man, not an object,
Mr. Smi... Sweetie.

592
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:38,929
A stranger doesn't tell
a father what a son is.

593
01:00:40,154 --> 01:00:43,032
You'll find
it's not me who's the stranger.

594
01:00:45,533 --> 01:00:48,331
Mrs. Stalker, let me put it this way:

595
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:51,666
You see that '65 Coup de Ville?
- It's a '66, not a '65.

596
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:56,288
I beg your pardon, it's a '65,
and although it's very nice,

597
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,471
it needs suspension work in the front.
- The suspension is perfect.

598
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:04,203
Fine. Then it needs a new alignment.

599
01:01:05,137 --> 01:01:10,131
Did you come here to give automotive
advice? - Though an older model,

600
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:13,481
it still has style.
- Sugar? - I never use it.

601
01:01:15,144 --> 01:01:17,339
Now imagine if you will,

602
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,411
a brand new Coup de Ville,
fresh from the factory,

603
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:26,823
sitting alongside your '65.

604
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:29,762
The beautiful lines of the older model

605
01:01:30,327 --> 01:01:34,161
lose their elegance. The body sags,
the finish is dull. You wash it,

606
01:01:34,788 --> 01:01:39,987
wax it, but it's still lifeless.
- Mr. Smilie...

607
01:01:41,085 --> 01:01:44,873
There isn't a thing you can do
to make it new again!

608
01:01:45,508 --> 01:01:48,864
Those two automobiles do not
belong together. Am I clear?

609
01:01:49,469 --> 01:01:53,223
No, the only thing that's clear,
Mr. Smilie... - No! Sweetie!

610
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:58,795
...is that your attempt to insult me
with car metaphors is incredibly

611
01:01:59,478 --> 01:02:03,107
immature! - Immature! Right!
You could be his mother!

612
01:02:03,732 --> 01:02:07,486
But I'm not,
Mr. Sweetie, I'm his lover.

613
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:12,428
And I must tell you, your nephew

614
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,506
is a wild animal in bed.
Perhaps you might ask him for lessons.

615
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:22,640
I had hoped his sexual awakening
would've been with someone who

616
01:02:23,335 --> 01:02:26,008
knew the difference
between making love and fucking!

617
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:39,341
Come on! Coffee break is over,
fellows. Back to work!

618
01:02:39,974 --> 01:02:44,923
Come on, Paul! Axel! Come on!
- No! I'm not going!

619
01:02:45,605 --> 01:02:49,314
Paul, grab the other arm!
I'm gonna kick the shit out of you,

620
01:02:49,942 --> 01:02:51,170
little son-of-a-bitch!

621
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:56,369
Come on, Axel! - You don't realize
how angry... - Just come along!

622
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:59,663
I'm really mad!
- Hands off him, Mr. Smilie!

623
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:06,944
Elaine, you can't shoot me,
I have this performance on Friday.

624
01:03:07,542 --> 01:03:10,056
It's an audition.

625
01:03:10,627 --> 01:03:13,585
It's not a performance.
It's an audition.

626
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:17,828
This is ridiculous.

627
01:03:18,385 --> 01:03:19,864
I mean...

628
01:03:21,013 --> 01:03:25,086
I mean, Mrs. Stalker,
we've said a lot of things, and some

629
01:03:25,725 --> 01:03:28,080
were half kidding...
Why don't you put down the gun?

630
01:03:29,897 --> 01:03:33,731
That I understand.
That makes sense.

631
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:37,192
No more of that.

632
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:40,497
Axel, don't forget, Friday at 8:30!

633
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:45,530
Yes, get in the car! Go back

634
01:03:46,161 --> 01:03:48,117
to where you should be!

635
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:58,052
I knew if Paul saw me,
he'd never understand

636
01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:02,870
that going to Papua New Guinea wasn't
the answer. Flying was the secret.

637
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:08,221
Columbus wouldn't think I was crazy
for building a flying machine,

638
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:13,601
because history is all dreams.
No rules or books. It's just there,

639
01:04:14,269 --> 01:04:18,899
waiting to be discovered
like when Columbus found this place.

640
01:04:19,568 --> 01:04:22,207
I don't know if he found his dream.

641
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:23,734
Fuck with me, now!

642
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:29,439
Because in the middle of a storm,
you can't turn back, like Elaine.

643
01:04:30,118 --> 01:04:32,951
She could only sail straight ahead.

644
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:37,088
If she asked me to build a rocket,
and take her to another galaxy,

645
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,539
I'd build a rocket.

646
01:06:19,807 --> 01:06:22,002
Very nice! Good.

647
01:06:23,266 --> 01:06:26,622
Excellent! You finished now?
- No! - No?

648
01:06:27,228 --> 01:06:29,344
No!
- You just finish.

649
01:06:29,898 --> 01:06:32,048
To remember my dreams,

650
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:35,918
I turn them into stories.
But dreams are like life.

651
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:40,647
You can't catch them in your hands,
because you can't really see them.

652
01:06:41,284 --> 01:06:46,039
If you believe in your dreams,
no tornado, volcano or typhoon

653
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:51,778
can knock you "out of love,"
because love exists on its own.

654
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,418
Listen to me,
if you ever touch this machine again,

655
01:06:56,005 --> 01:06:58,041
I'm going to kill you!

656
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:02,565
Being caught in the dream of two
women is the craziest storm of all.

657
01:07:03,179 --> 01:07:07,138
The battle isn't good and evil,
but between weaker and stronger.

658
01:07:07,933 --> 01:07:11,846
The weaker is desperate for air.
At this moment, my feet were

659
01:07:12,479 --> 01:07:14,709
planted in the ground like a tree,

660
01:07:15,273 --> 01:07:18,265
and if you moved to one side,
you become the storm.

661
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:23,411
Even though I was ready to kill Grace,
I wasn't sure which side I'd move to.

662
01:07:24,072 --> 01:07:27,064
So I tried to anchor myself
until the storm passed.

663
01:07:56,228 --> 01:07:57,661
Disgusting!

664
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:20,505
Turn around!

665
01:10:57,993 --> 01:11:00,348
That's the second time.
- What is?

666
01:11:00,912 --> 01:11:03,426
Where were you two minutes ago?
- Here?

667
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:07,219
You smashed the flying machine again.
- Nope.

668
01:11:07,795 --> 01:11:12,505
Because I don't care. - Liar!
- I was here. - Prove it!

669
01:11:14,177 --> 01:11:17,169
How? You see me playing, right?

670
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:22,361
To my turtles. - Why's your hair wet?
- Because I just took a bath.

671
01:11:26,228 --> 01:11:30,619
You like these turtles? - Yeah.
- If you want these bastards to live,

672
01:11:31,694 --> 01:11:36,643
stay away from that flying machine.
- I'm scared. - Are you scared?

673
01:11:37,322 --> 01:11:39,552
I'm scared.
- Are you scared?

674
01:12:09,394 --> 01:12:12,591
D'you think it'll fly?
- I'm more than sure.

675
01:12:13,189 --> 01:12:16,261
Let's do it then!
I can't wait any longer.

676
01:13:00,693 --> 01:13:02,524
I'm flying!

677
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:14,101
I'm flying!

678
01:13:55,244 --> 01:13:58,759
Sometimes you have to
crash into a tree to know what to do,

679
01:13:59,374 --> 01:14:02,684
and realize the secret of anything
is meaningless.

680
01:14:03,295 --> 01:14:08,005
My English teacher
talked about this Russian guy,

681
01:14:08,675 --> 01:14:11,269
who said that if you see a gun
in the first half of a book,

682
01:14:12,135 --> 01:14:15,411
you can be sure
it'll go off in the second half.

683
01:14:16,013 --> 01:14:20,370
Somebody was going to use that gun.
The minute I saw the revolver

684
01:14:21,018 --> 01:14:24,135
in the barn,
I started getting nervous, because

685
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:28,085
I realized it was the revolver
from my dream.

686
01:14:29,651 --> 01:14:33,610
Never did I think I'd be an Eskimo
in the desert, knowing

687
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:38,197
I had to kill something
to put it out of its misery.

688
01:14:39,201 --> 01:14:43,752
Suddenly, it was all clear to me,
like wiping the window in the rain.

689
01:14:46,168 --> 01:14:50,127
I was afraid if I didn't do anything,
at any moment something would blow up,

690
01:14:50,754 --> 01:14:52,870
possibly me.

691
01:14:53,423 --> 01:14:58,543
So I decided to do it,
just to keep from killing myself.

692
01:15:00,388 --> 01:15:04,825
The only problem was
that they were both so miserable,

693
01:15:05,476 --> 01:15:08,036
I didn't know which one to shoot...

694
01:15:46,348 --> 01:15:49,499
I've been waiting for you.
- What?

695
01:15:50,101 --> 01:15:52,490
Are you gonna use it?

696
01:15:54,856 --> 01:15:57,575
Don't talk to me.
- Do it!

697
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:02,796
What are you afraid of, Axel?

698
01:16:03,991 --> 01:16:05,344
Nothing.

699
01:16:09,202 --> 01:16:10,555
Do it!

700
01:16:21,048 --> 01:16:23,926
Do it, Axel, do it!
- Shut up!

701
01:16:25,343 --> 01:16:27,937
What are you afraid of, Axel?
- Nothing.

702
01:16:28,513 --> 01:16:30,151
Do it!
- Shut up!

703
01:16:31,849 --> 01:16:36,479
Do it! - Please shut up, Grace.
- Do it! Do it! - Shut up!

704
01:16:38,606 --> 01:16:42,599
If you're not going to shoot me,
sit down on the bed.

705
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:49,018
You didn't come to shoot me. You came
to make my mother happy. - Don't talk!

706
01:16:51,325 --> 01:16:54,283
Axel. - Turn around!
- You know what, Axel?

707
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:57,823
I had a friend just like you.

708
01:16:58,374 --> 01:17:03,653
When we were little,
we would rollerskate on my huge roof,

709
01:17:04,338 --> 01:17:05,566
no people,

710
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:10,720
and I each time
I would get closer to the edge,

711
01:17:14,305 --> 01:17:17,980
and he was standing behind me,

712
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:20,717
and wouldn't let me go over.

713
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:30,676
Okay.

714
01:17:31,196 --> 01:17:32,549
It's okay.

715
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,076
I have a game for you.

716
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,247
Okay.
- Okay.

717
01:17:52,424 --> 01:17:55,177
Old game, strict rules.

718
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:21,182
It's your turn.
- No.

719
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:25,297
You don't say no to this game.

720
01:18:25,872 --> 01:18:27,351
Okay, I'll go.

721
01:18:31,334 --> 01:18:33,052
Grace... please!

722
01:18:35,464 --> 01:18:37,056
Don't.
- It's a game, Axel.

723
01:18:37,591 --> 01:18:39,024
Stop! Don't do it!

724
01:18:40,594 --> 01:18:42,744
My mother's sleeping.

725
01:18:43,306 --> 01:18:47,185
Okay, Axel, Look. Look at me!
- Fuck you!

726
01:18:50,104 --> 01:18:51,332
No!

727
01:18:59,153 --> 01:19:00,666
Here. Take it.

728
01:19:01,698 --> 01:19:03,290
I don't want it.

729
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:07,133
What are you, afraid?
- No. I just don't feel like dying.

730
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:10,542
That's not fair.
- Not fair?

731
01:19:11,123 --> 01:19:13,398
You came in to kill me,

732
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:17,507
and we're playing a game,
and you're breaking the rules!

733
01:19:18,757 --> 01:19:21,794
Axel, what are you,
this frightened little boy?

734
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,658
You afraid of everything?

735
01:19:27,178 --> 01:19:29,567
Axel? You're just afraid, huh?

736
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:34,500
You're just a little boy,
you're so scared.

737
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,333
Take the gun!

738
01:19:37,897 --> 01:19:39,330
Take it!

739
01:20:23,981 --> 01:20:25,096
Go!

740
01:20:33,243 --> 01:20:34,312
No!

741
01:20:36,161 --> 01:20:37,276
No, Axel!

742
01:20:37,789 --> 01:20:41,498
You can't do that!
That's breaking the rules!

743
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,837
Lt'll be okay.

744
01:22:14,503 --> 01:22:16,778
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!

745
01:22:18,298 --> 01:22:20,892
Our next act, Mr. Paul...

746
01:22:21,466 --> 01:22:22,694
Ledger!

747
01:22:24,136 --> 01:22:28,414
Leger. Paul Leger.
- Paul Leger!

748
01:22:40,442 --> 01:22:43,479
My n...
Hello. My name is Paul Leger.

749
01:22:44,614 --> 01:22:48,402
You may be wondering what Leger means.

750
01:22:49,035 --> 01:22:53,108
You may be wondering
what kind of name it is. Italian?

751
01:22:53,747 --> 01:22:55,544
Swedish?

752
01:22:56,082 --> 01:22:59,358
Well, actually,
it's French, and it literally means,

753
01:22:59,961 --> 01:23:04,398
"Born to act."
And that's what I'm going to do

754
01:23:05,298 --> 01:23:08,893
this evening.
Alfred Hitchcock style,

755
01:23:09,513 --> 01:23:14,143
performing from the classic,
"North by Northwest."

756
01:23:14,809 --> 01:23:19,837
The famous scene
in which Carey Grant is...

757
01:23:20,523 --> 01:23:23,879
being chased by a crop-dusting plane.

758
01:25:01,283 --> 01:25:02,432
Fuck!

759
01:25:02,951 --> 01:25:03,986
Shit!

760
01:25:19,634 --> 01:25:24,424
Thank you very much, Paul Leger!
- I'm not done!

761
01:25:27,807 --> 01:25:29,525
I'm not done!

762
01:25:38,777 --> 01:25:40,290
I'm not done!

763
01:26:04,842 --> 01:26:05,831
Thank you!

764
01:26:06,344 --> 01:26:10,223
A one? One? I was brilliant!
Can't you see brilliance?

765
01:26:10,848 --> 01:26:13,078
A one!
I should have got a ten!

766
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:16,678
A ten!
A one! A one! On amateur night?

767
01:26:17,269 --> 01:26:20,784
Axel, I really have to talk to you.
- Hi, Millie. Sit down.

768
01:26:21,399 --> 01:26:26,678
A one? What do you know about art?
- Can we go over there? - Sure.

769
01:26:27,365 --> 01:26:30,562
Elaine. This is Elaine.
This is Millie. - Hello.

770
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,196
Leo's fiancיe.

771
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:36,833
This is Grace.
Grace, this is Millie.

772
01:26:37,415 --> 01:26:39,053
Okay...

773
01:26:58,017 --> 01:27:00,008
Where is he, Millie? Leo!

774
01:27:01,187 --> 01:27:04,224
He's over here.
He's locked himself in the bedroom.

775
01:27:05,776 --> 01:27:09,485
Leo, can I come in?
- Open the door, Leo!

776
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,195
Open up!
- Go away!

777
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:18,289
Let's go inside.
- Alright. One... two... three!

778
01:27:31,424 --> 01:27:34,063
Millie! Get an ambulance!

779
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:38,046
You okay?

780
01:27:46,438 --> 01:27:51,034
Shouldn't I say something?
- To who? - Your parents?

781
01:27:51,692 --> 01:27:54,081
They're dead, Leo.

782
01:27:54,653 --> 01:27:57,611
I know that,
but should I say something or not?

783
01:27:58,199 --> 01:28:03,148
Don't talk like that. You'll be fine.
- I know, I'm gonna be fine.

784
01:28:25,559 --> 01:28:30,075
Promise you'll take care of Millie.
- Don't say that!

785
01:28:31,647 --> 01:28:34,002
Don't talk, just promise.

786
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:36,678
Alright, I promise.

787
01:28:37,652 --> 01:28:41,725
Good, now that that's taken care of,
I want you to...

788
01:28:42,907 --> 01:28:45,501
buy yourself a few nice suits
and go back to New York.

789
01:28:46,078 --> 01:28:48,831
I want to stay with you.
I want to sell cars.

790
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:54,081
I don't want you to sell cars!
You'll grow up soon enough!

791
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:56,664
I am grown up, Leo.

792
01:28:58,421 --> 01:28:59,774
I love you.

793
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:10,093
I'm okay, I'm just...

794
01:29:10,683 --> 01:29:12,241
just stacking cars.

795
01:29:13,393 --> 01:29:15,111
I need you to help me.

796
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:18,037
It's too late.

797
01:29:19,149 --> 01:29:22,380
They're not driving
the big models anymore.

798
01:29:25,072 --> 01:29:29,748
Leo, we can work in the showroom,
we can sell cars together,

799
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:31,729
you and me.

800
01:29:32,621 --> 01:29:38,014
Too late, Axel, the dream's over.
- I've been practicing my "Hellos."

801
01:29:38,709 --> 01:29:40,700
You want to hear my "Hellos"?

802
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:46,979
I got to start climbing.

803
01:29:49,427 --> 01:29:51,463
It's a long way, Axel.

804
01:29:54,182 --> 01:29:56,855
It's a long way to the moon.

805
01:32:21,111 --> 01:32:22,942
You never came back.

806
01:32:24,864 --> 01:32:29,016
There was a lot of legal stuff
to take care of. I'm sorry.

807
01:32:32,871 --> 01:32:35,180
So not even a phone call?

808
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:39,868
I know, Elaine. I just
got caught up in what was going on.

809
01:32:40,504 --> 01:32:43,860
I'm really sorry.
I wanted to call a thousand times.

810
01:32:44,466 --> 01:32:46,024
I'm really sorry.

811
01:32:47,427 --> 01:32:52,057
So you just decided to pop over
for a quick cup of coffee?

812
01:32:52,724 --> 01:32:56,683
You can just waltz over here?
- Please, it's your birthday tomorrow.

813
01:32:57,311 --> 01:33:01,190
What do you care? - My uncle died.
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner,

814
01:33:01,817 --> 01:33:05,856
I had to take care of the funeral.
- There's no sympathy here!

815
01:33:06,487 --> 01:33:08,842
Is that okay with you?

816
01:33:14,161 --> 01:33:17,198
Please, let's celebrate your birthday.

817
01:33:17,789 --> 01:33:20,940
What do you care?

818
01:33:22,585 --> 01:33:26,544
You know what you should do?
Turn around and go back.

819
01:33:27,171 --> 01:33:30,129
Just go back
where you came from, OK?

820
01:33:30,718 --> 01:33:32,868
How's Millie, huh?

821
01:33:36,057 --> 01:33:39,732
Where are you going?
- What did you just say? I should go.

822
01:33:40,352 --> 01:33:44,823
Are you going? Are you just going to
go now? How long are you going for?

823
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:49,155
Are you going forever?
- Do you want me to stay or go?

824
01:33:49,778 --> 01:33:53,896
I want you to go!
- Fine! - I want you!

825
01:33:57,118 --> 01:33:59,074
I want you to come!

826
01:34:09,587 --> 01:34:12,818
So what do you want to do?
You want to go or stay?

827
01:34:14,217 --> 01:34:16,094
I want to stay.

828
01:34:16,635 --> 01:34:19,627
I don't think you need this right now.

829
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:25,867
She'll be okay.
She just gets like this.

830
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:31,071
Alright, but I'm not
staying in there tonight, okay?

831
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:50,771
It's going to be okay...

832
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:53,349
Nothing is going to be OK!

833
01:34:54,421 --> 01:34:55,649
Come on!

834
01:34:57,382 --> 01:35:01,011
Elaine, wait!
I brought you a present.

835
01:35:01,637 --> 01:35:05,710
I don't want it!
- You don't even know what it is!

836
01:35:06,349 --> 01:35:08,544
Elaine, you don't know what it is.

837
01:35:10,687 --> 01:35:12,996
Come on, Elaine, please. Take it.

838
01:35:13,564 --> 01:35:16,954
I don't want it.
- It's a present!

839
01:35:17,567 --> 01:35:21,685
Thank you for the wad of paper.
- It's two tickets for Shishmaref.

840
01:35:22,321 --> 01:35:24,039
It's right on the Bering Sea.

841
01:35:24,573 --> 01:35:29,727
Train tickets? - Yeah. - You expect me
me to go all the way to Alaska

842
01:35:30,412 --> 01:35:33,848
by train? - You said you didn't want
to fly again... - No, I didn't!

843
01:35:34,459 --> 01:35:37,178
Yes, you did! - No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did! - No, I didn't!

844
01:35:37,753 --> 01:35:40,221
I want to fly there.
- Okay.

845
01:35:50,391 --> 01:35:55,545
I'm gonna cancel the train tickets
and make a plane reservation, okay?

846
01:35:56,896 --> 01:35:59,330
Alright.
- Stop!

847
01:36:00,565 --> 01:36:04,353
What?
- You think I'm old, don't you?

848
01:36:05,821 --> 01:36:08,972
No! - Yes, you do.
- Don't tell me what I think.

849
01:36:09,575 --> 01:36:12,931
That's why the train, you're ashamed!
- No, I'm not! I'm going to

850
01:36:13,538 --> 01:36:16,416
trade these tickets in.
- I don't mind. You're right.

851
01:36:16,997 --> 01:36:19,750
I'm old, you're young.
It's disgusting!

852
01:36:20,334 --> 01:36:23,531
Just stop it!
- Can't you find someone your own age?

853
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:27,122
Why me? - I want to be with you!
- I don't need your pity!

854
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:33,551
It's not pity, Elaine. I'm trying
to give you love. - Love!

855
01:36:34,264 --> 01:36:38,257
What do you know about love?
- What do you know? - You're a child!

856
01:36:39,851 --> 01:36:43,207
What you need is someone sweet...

857
01:36:44,189 --> 01:36:45,781
and beautiful...

858
01:36:47,527 --> 01:36:49,802
and young!
- Like who?

859
01:36:51,155 --> 01:36:52,873
Like Millie.

860
01:36:53,407 --> 01:36:56,763
She's like Switzerland,
beautiful but dumb. - Listen.

861
01:36:57,911 --> 01:37:02,223
She was my uncle's fiancיe.
I don't want her. I want you!

862
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:07,042
This is crazy! - Ronny used to
say that, and Grace still says it,

863
01:37:07,671 --> 01:37:10,822
"Take your medication, Mother,
or you'll be crazy."

864
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:15,212
But he hurt her,
and I killed him,

865
01:37:15,843 --> 01:37:19,438
and I'm not crazy!
- And I'm not your husband!

866
01:37:20,058 --> 01:37:23,687
Do you understand?
You are fucking crazy! - Get out!

867
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:26,426
I'm not damn leaving!
- Get out of my house!

868
01:37:26,981 --> 01:37:30,337
You asked me to stay!
- I did not! I want you to go!

869
01:37:30,944 --> 01:37:34,732
Go! - I'm fucking tired of this game.
What do you want?

870
01:37:35,363 --> 01:37:39,914
What do you want?
- I want you to understand me!

871
01:37:41,286 --> 01:37:45,040
You know something?
- What? - Paul was right.

872
01:37:46,957 --> 01:37:48,788
Paul was right?
- Paul was right.

873
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,735
Paul was right?

874
01:37:52,254 --> 01:37:55,326
You listen to him?
What did he say?

875
01:37:55,923 --> 01:37:57,276
Nothing.
- What?

876
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,837
Not a fucking thing!
- I'm going to find out... who I am.

877
01:38:01,427 --> 01:38:05,136
You're going nowhere!
Where are you gonna go?

878
01:38:05,766 --> 01:38:08,917
Let me go!
- Elaine, come on, you're not crazy.

879
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,478
Show me you're not crazy!
- Let me go!

880
01:38:15,066 --> 01:38:20,015
I don't think you're old. I think
you're beautiful. Don't say it again.

881
01:38:20,697 --> 01:38:22,016
Let me go!

882
01:38:22,534 --> 01:38:23,808
Stop!

883
01:38:26,745 --> 01:38:29,259
Elaine!
- Get out of my life! - Put it down!

884
01:38:29,831 --> 01:38:31,583
Put it down!
- Get out of my house!

885
01:38:36,252 --> 01:38:38,812
That's enough!
- No!

886
01:38:39,674 --> 01:38:41,187
That's enough!

887
01:39:41,564 --> 01:39:44,158
I can't believe she did it!

888
01:40:06,881 --> 01:40:08,837
I'm going to fly!

889
01:40:24,312 --> 01:40:26,143
You fucked my wife?

890
01:40:28,943 --> 01:40:30,740
You fucked my wife?

891
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:27,278
Oh, fuck!

892
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:33,368
Come on!

893
01:42:35,519 --> 01:42:40,035
Listen! That is Mexico!
This is America.

894
01:42:40,691 --> 01:42:44,286
We speak English.
- Yes. - Look at his face!

895
01:42:48,782 --> 01:42:51,580
What do you mean?

896
01:43:16,014 --> 01:43:17,083
Shit!

897
01:43:58,347 --> 01:44:02,579
Paul, will you quit it?
- I'm having a nightmare!

898
01:44:09,982 --> 01:44:13,133
You're distracting her.
She's trying to fly the plane.

899
01:44:13,734 --> 01:44:16,009
Please!
- This isn't happening!

900
01:44:36,382 --> 01:44:38,020
I hate this film!

901
01:44:53,855 --> 01:44:55,732
Life is beautiful.

902
01:44:58,527 --> 01:45:00,961
I think what you did is beautiful.

903
01:45:06,034 --> 01:45:07,069
Thanks.

904
01:45:08,578 --> 01:45:10,534
I'm sorry about your uncle.

905
01:45:13,209 --> 01:45:14,927
Yeah, me too.

906
01:45:16,462 --> 01:45:18,851
Where d'you think he is right now?

907
01:45:20,048 --> 01:45:21,322
Right now?

908
01:45:24,092 --> 01:45:29,041
He's probably on the moon,
driving a golden Cadillac.

909
01:45:33,769 --> 01:45:35,646
Life is beautiful.

910
01:45:37,689 --> 01:45:39,759
Grace?
- Yeah.

911
01:45:43,444 --> 01:45:46,561
D'you think
it would be really bad if...

912
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:51,810
I kissed you?
- No.

913
01:45:52,996 --> 01:45:53,951
No?

914
01:46:21,187 --> 01:46:22,666
You want to hear it?

915
01:46:25,233 --> 01:46:29,192
I'm sorry. - Are you going to listen?
- Yes. - Alright.

916
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:34,177
Elaine is like a blueberry pie.
The pie is good, but it's very messy.

917
01:46:34,828 --> 01:46:39,777
She's a kind of trick. - Oh my gosh!
- Let's say she's a blueberry pie.

918
01:46:40,873 --> 01:46:43,341
She looks good. She smells good.

919
01:46:43,918 --> 01:46:47,308
Probably even tastes good,
but there's one problem:

920
01:46:47,921 --> 01:46:52,278
When you take a bite, you've got
pins poking you in the mouth.

921
01:46:53,093 --> 01:46:57,564
Choking you in the mouth.
You understand what I'm telling you?

922
01:46:58,224 --> 01:47:00,021
Good boy. Do you understand?

923
01:47:00,558 --> 01:47:02,913
Do you understand?
- Yeah. - Okay.

924
01:47:03,476 --> 01:47:06,434
These philosophies,
with pies and bananas

925
01:47:07,021 --> 01:47:08,898
and Q-tips and...

926
01:47:09,441 --> 01:47:11,511
I'm an artist.

927
01:47:12,693 --> 01:47:16,083
You're a bullshit artist.
- Bullshit artist, artist, whatever.

928
01:47:16,823 --> 01:47:20,577
Art is art.
- Axel, it's my birthday. Dance?

929
01:47:21,203 --> 01:47:23,000
Run! Beautiful.

930
01:47:26,374 --> 01:47:27,329
Sure.

931
01:47:30,795 --> 01:47:34,231
I was right.
- What time is the train for Alaska?

932
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,638
You mean the plane?
- No, the train.

933
01:47:38,219 --> 01:47:40,892
We're flying.
Didn't you fly all day?

934
01:47:41,471 --> 01:47:44,941
You can't take that all the way
to Alaska, it's too cold.

935
01:47:45,558 --> 01:47:48,914
I don't want to fly there.
- I already changed the reservations.

936
01:47:49,521 --> 01:47:51,910
We have to take the train. It's safer.

937
01:47:53,608 --> 01:47:56,998
So you want me to
switch the plane reservations

938
01:47:57,612 --> 01:48:01,844
into train reservations?
- Yes. - Okay.

939
01:48:57,375 --> 01:48:58,524
It's time.

940
01:49:14,267 --> 01:49:17,862
37, 38, 39, 40...

941
01:49:56,847 --> 01:49:59,566
Stairs, stairs, stairs...

942
01:50:00,141 --> 01:50:01,893
Wall... Axel?

943
01:50:02,436 --> 01:50:04,188
Axel, here, here.

944
01:50:05,315 --> 01:50:06,634
I'm sorry.

945
01:50:12,655 --> 01:50:15,488
Don't touch me.
Watch my face.

946
01:50:16,283 --> 01:50:19,036
Axel?
- Watch my face. Wait.

947
01:50:19,617 --> 01:50:20,686
Wait.

948
01:50:26,752 --> 01:50:29,107
Stairs!
- Stairs!

949
01:50:30,464 --> 01:50:32,455
Axel!
- Stairs!

950
01:50:33,007 --> 01:50:34,122
Tree!

951
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:42,068
Tree and table!

952
01:50:49,355 --> 01:50:51,471
I can't see nothing. Axel!

953
01:50:54,692 --> 01:50:56,250
I can't see!

954
01:50:59,447 --> 01:51:01,119
Wait for me!

955
01:51:03,201 --> 01:51:04,600
I found it!

956
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:07,247
What?
- Here!

957
01:51:07,788 --> 01:51:10,860
She found it! - Here!
- She found it! - Wait for me!

958
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:14,133
I found it!

959
01:51:14,712 --> 01:51:16,509
Come on, I found it!

960
01:51:17,048 --> 01:51:20,597
Paul!
- Axel! I can't see nothing!

961
01:51:21,302 --> 01:51:24,931
Axel?
- Where are you?

962
01:51:25,556 --> 01:51:27,387
Here? Okay everybody?

963
01:51:30,979 --> 01:51:32,378
It's raining!

964
01:51:33,521 --> 01:51:34,954
It's raining!

965
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,841
It's raining!

966
01:51:48,078 --> 01:51:49,796
Come on, it's raining.

967
01:52:03,174 --> 01:52:04,573
It's raining.

968
01:52:10,264 --> 01:52:12,016
It's fucking raining!

969
01:52:14,392 --> 01:52:17,111
Mom! Mother!
- Yes!

970
01:52:18,897 --> 01:52:21,127
I'm coming over, mom!

971
01:52:21,691 --> 01:52:24,842
Here we go! Happy Birthday!
- I love you. - I love you!

972
01:52:25,446 --> 01:52:27,755
Happy Birthday!
- I love you.

973
01:52:29,241 --> 01:52:31,072
I'm going in!

974
01:53:05,275 --> 01:53:06,594
Go play.

975
01:53:08,444 --> 01:53:09,718
Go play.

976
01:53:26,212 --> 01:53:30,842
Did I tell you about when Axel treated
me for my 21st birthday dinner?

977
01:53:31,507 --> 01:53:34,704
My good pal? - No.
- Can I tell her the story?

978
01:53:35,301 --> 01:53:39,852
Or would you like to?
- Go ahead. - Anyway, he decided

979
01:53:40,515 --> 01:53:44,667
he was going to take me out for dinner
and pay for it himself.

980
01:53:45,311 --> 01:53:50,431
He'd saved up some money.
We go to this restaurant.

981
01:53:51,109 --> 01:53:55,500
This place we used to go with Leo.
We drove up there together...

982
01:53:56,154 --> 01:53:58,429
and we had this great big meal.

983
01:53:58,992 --> 01:54:03,270
I knew it would be expensive,
but he said, "The sky's the limit."

984
01:54:03,912 --> 01:54:07,871
After dinner I went to the bathroom,
and when I come out,

985
01:54:08,499 --> 01:54:13,175
I see him standing by the door,
and he looks unusually nervous.

986
01:54:13,837 --> 01:54:18,513
And the waiter is standing by
our table, flapping the check,

987
01:54:19,178 --> 01:54:22,727
kind of pointing at the check.
And I look at Axel... - You coming?

988
01:54:23,348 --> 01:54:26,067
I go up to him,
"What's going on? Did you pay?"

989
01:54:26,641 --> 01:54:28,597
Will you help me wrap the presents?

990
01:54:29,142 --> 01:54:32,612
"You said you were paying."
He made me bring no money.

991
01:54:33,231 --> 01:54:35,426
I say, "Whaddya mean
you have no money, Axel?"

992
01:54:35,984 --> 01:54:40,136
Next thing I know, we're being chased
by our waiter,

993
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:43,010
who was fifty, but, like, mean...

994
01:54:48,245 --> 01:54:50,440
Hi!
- Hi!

995
01:54:59,005 --> 01:55:00,358
What's that?

996
01:55:02,759 --> 01:55:04,192
No!

997
01:55:06,845 --> 01:55:08,324
Very nice!

998
01:55:12,601 --> 01:55:14,671
I want you to have something.

999
01:55:16,355 --> 01:55:18,107
For me?
- Uh huh.

1000
01:55:19,983 --> 01:55:23,612
It's beautiful.
- I want you to have the world.

1001
01:55:25,865 --> 01:55:27,014
Thank you.

1002
01:55:29,950 --> 01:55:33,226
I was thinking about what you said.
- What did I say?

1003
01:55:34,496 --> 01:55:38,887
That I was supposed to be with you.
- Hand me that tape?

1004
01:55:40,046 --> 01:55:41,001
Yeah.

1005
01:55:43,046 --> 01:55:47,358
When I first met her I felt something,

1006
01:55:48,010 --> 01:55:49,728
kind of strong.

1007
01:55:51,179 --> 01:55:53,135
I didn't know what it was.

1008
01:55:54,266 --> 01:55:56,257
I didn't know what to call it.

1009
01:55:58,269 --> 01:56:02,103
Now everything's turned around,
and she's like...

1010
01:56:04,526 --> 01:56:06,801
She's like this cloud

1011
01:56:08,069 --> 01:56:13,143
that I can see through,
and on the other side I see you.

1012
01:56:18,412 --> 01:56:21,165
And I feel something very strong.

1013
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:29,059
I think I know what to call it.

1014
01:56:33,427 --> 01:56:35,383
That make any sense?

1015
01:56:37,597 --> 01:56:39,349
Put your finger here?

1016
01:56:41,935 --> 01:56:44,085
Yup. What do you think?

1017
01:56:46,272 --> 01:56:49,821
About what?
- About us, kind of...

1018
01:56:50,443 --> 01:56:51,956
belonging together.

1019
01:56:53,027 --> 01:56:55,541
Will Paul like this lamp?

1020
01:56:56,116 --> 01:56:58,949
He'll love it.
What do you think?

1021
01:57:03,537 --> 01:57:05,926
I think 2 wrongs don't make a right.

1022
01:57:06,498 --> 01:57:09,968
Meaning what?
- Meaning us. Two wrongs.

1023
01:57:12,005 --> 01:57:15,600
What if we're two rights,
and everybody else is wrong?

1024
01:57:19,262 --> 01:57:22,413
Either way, we're going to be screwed.
- But screwed together.

1025
01:57:25,308 --> 01:57:29,745
I wish I could take you with me.
- Let's go right now! No trains,

1026
01:57:30,688 --> 01:57:35,045
no planes, no fucking doors.
We'll go right out the window!

1027
01:57:36,946 --> 01:57:39,506
I have to take care of some business.

1028
01:57:45,243 --> 01:57:47,518
The house?
- Yes.

1029
01:57:51,958 --> 01:57:57,112
Last night I dreamt I'm in the desert,
and my house is tied around my neck,

1030
01:57:57,798 --> 01:58:01,552
and my body's breaking under its
weight, and it's engulfed in flames.

1031
01:58:02,176 --> 01:58:05,009
The flames are climbing the rope, and

1032
01:58:05,596 --> 01:58:09,475
they almost reach my neck, and before
they do, I wake up, and I know

1033
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:12,409
that I have to get rid of this house.

1034
01:58:15,189 --> 01:58:18,545
I want you to promise me something.
- What?

1035
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:25,126
When you're done with the house,
we can go away.

1036
01:58:26,908 --> 01:58:27,977
Come on!

1037
01:58:29,076 --> 01:58:30,191
Come on!

1038
01:58:36,709 --> 01:58:37,824
I promise.

1039
01:58:39,337 --> 01:58:40,736
You promise?
- Yeah.

1040
01:58:41,421 --> 01:58:43,139
I promise.

1041
01:58:45,341 --> 01:58:46,296
Good.

1042
01:58:54,684 --> 01:58:57,357
It's a funny story.

1043
01:59:06,528 --> 01:59:08,917
I have a lot of funny stories.

1044
01:59:22,168 --> 01:59:23,806
Here they are!

1045
01:59:26,005 --> 01:59:30,317
Is this is for me?
You bought this for me? Very nice.

1046
01:59:32,304 --> 01:59:33,259
Here.

1047
01:59:34,555 --> 01:59:35,704
Thank you.

1048
01:59:36,223 --> 01:59:38,179
You open yours first.

1049
01:59:40,558 --> 01:59:42,514
Look what I got from her.

1050
01:59:43,062 --> 01:59:45,018
I feel like a clam, right?

1051
01:59:46,231 --> 01:59:49,780
I've always wanted to be a big
sea turtle. They're always happy.

1052
01:59:50,402 --> 01:59:55,078
How do you know that it's happy?
- Because they're always smiling.

1053
01:59:55,743 --> 01:59:59,019
Turtles don't smile.
- They do. - They don't.

1054
02:00:00,328 --> 02:00:04,446
I don't think turtles smile.
- They do, and they live forever.

1055
02:00:05,082 --> 02:00:09,633
Who wants to live forever?
I'd like to die when I'm 35.

1056
02:00:10,796 --> 02:00:14,584
You want to die when you're 35?
- Yes. - How?

1057
02:00:15,219 --> 02:00:20,612
How? I'd take off all my clothes and
get into a bathtub of ice-cold vodka.

1058
02:00:21,305 --> 02:00:24,854
I'd have the TV in the room,
watching "North by Northwest,"

1059
02:00:25,477 --> 02:00:29,629
when the airplane scene comes,
I'd pull the TV into the tub.

1060
02:00:30,272 --> 02:00:32,103
I hate that film!

1061
02:00:33,319 --> 02:00:35,753
I'd like to die as a little girl.

1062
02:00:36,322 --> 02:00:40,634
I'd go up on the roof
and jump off, and I'd be flying.

1063
02:00:41,282 --> 02:00:46,197
I'd look down and see all the people,
but instead of falling, I'd just fly,

1064
02:00:46,872 --> 02:00:48,783
higher and higher.

1065
02:00:51,085 --> 02:00:52,598
What did I get?

1066
02:00:53,130 --> 02:00:56,566
What is this thing?
- Lava lamp. - Nice.

1067
02:00:57,297 --> 02:01:00,334
Axel, what about you?
- It's very nice.

1068
02:01:00,927 --> 02:01:02,679
I'd like to be...

1069
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:08,817
I'd like to be thrown off a cliff, and
my body could smash into the rocks.

1070
02:01:10,811 --> 02:01:16,283
But I wouldn't want a lot of people
at the funeral, looking at me.

1071
02:01:17,483 --> 02:01:21,078
You'd be smashed up. Why would you
want them to look at you? - I don't

1072
02:01:21,695 --> 02:01:24,573
want to be in the box,
people staring at me.

1073
02:01:25,157 --> 02:01:27,830
You'll wind up living forever.
- No.

1074
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:30,685
Grace, what about you?

1075
02:01:31,664 --> 02:01:33,780
Me? I'm not gong to die.

1076
02:01:34,333 --> 02:01:38,804
I'm going to live forever, until one
day I'll wake up and I'll be a turtle.

1077
02:01:39,462 --> 02:01:40,941
Turtle-Grace!

1078
02:01:49,222 --> 02:01:50,450
Sing it!

1079
02:02:11,285 --> 02:02:13,276
Night.
- Good night.

1080
02:02:14,788 --> 02:02:16,221
I love you.

1081
02:02:19,416 --> 02:02:22,772
Good night. - Why "Good night"?
We just got by the fire.

1082
02:02:23,379 --> 02:02:27,611
We're having a good time.
- I have to get up and do things.

1083
02:02:28,258 --> 02:02:31,807
Stay a little while.
- Come on.

1084
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:36,389
Come on!
- Okay, I'll see you. "Good bye."

1085
02:02:37,849 --> 02:02:39,362
Come on, Grace!

1086
02:02:40,979 --> 02:02:44,016
Is something wrong?
Did I say something?

1087
02:03:06,294 --> 02:03:08,125
Come on!

1088
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:34,188
Axel, I'm tired too.
- In the middle of the song!

1089
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:37,857
Are you coming, Axel?
- Yup. Good night.

1090
02:03:38,449 --> 02:03:42,840
Just leave me in the middle of a song!
I had a great moment!

1091
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:48,117
Go up and sleep,
leaving me soaking wet here!

1092
02:03:48,708 --> 02:03:53,304
Good night, Paul. - Night, Elaine.
Wasn't that a funny story I said?

1093
02:03:53,962 --> 02:03:57,193
What do you know about funny?
Throw your dinner on the floor.

1094
02:03:57,798 --> 02:04:02,474
No one wants to cut the birthday cake.
Well, I'll cut the cake, thank you.

1095
02:04:03,138 --> 02:04:06,414
Happy Birthday to me!
Happy Birthday to Paul!

1096
02:04:07,016 --> 02:04:08,972
That's me! Paul!

1097
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:13,479
Looks like she left about
45 candles off the cake.

1098
02:04:18,403 --> 02:04:21,873
Alright! Good!
Enough, guys. Enough!

1099
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:25,448
Stop! Come on.

1100
02:04:26,911 --> 02:04:31,985
I've got to work.
Time is money. Have a drink.

1101
02:04:46,931 --> 02:04:49,047
You need a drink.

1102
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:53,558
Go home, suffer with your families.
Suffer like animals!

1103
02:04:56,271 --> 02:05:01,299
Why do I have to talk to four
fake artists? That's my day!

1104
02:05:02,236 --> 02:05:03,715
So good!

1105
02:05:10,701 --> 02:05:12,293
"The Godfather"!

1106
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:18,541
...big deal, and there was something
in it for me if I could help him out.

1107
02:05:19,251 --> 02:05:23,369
He said you were being
tough on the negotiations,

1108
02:05:24,006 --> 02:05:27,237
but if they could get
a little help and close the deal fast,

1109
02:05:27,969 --> 02:05:31,882
it'd be good for the family.
- Do you believe that?

1110
02:05:33,014 --> 02:05:36,802
Do you believe that? - He said
there was something in it for me!

1111
02:05:37,435 --> 02:05:40,552
On my own!
- I've always taken care of you.

1112
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:43,111
Taken care of me?

1113
02:05:44,525 --> 02:05:46,959
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1114
02:05:47,655 --> 02:05:51,807
You ever think about that?
You ever once think about that?

1115
02:05:53,074 --> 02:05:56,749
Send Freddo off to do this!

1116
02:05:57,913 --> 02:06:01,906
Let Freddo take care of...
...some Mickey Mouse night club.

1117
02:06:02,543 --> 02:06:05,137
Send Freddo
to pick up somebody at the airport!

1118
02:06:05,712 --> 02:06:09,421
I'm your older brother, and
I was stepped over! - Pop wanted it.

1119
02:06:10,047 --> 02:06:12,277
It ain't the way I wanted it!

1120
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:15,626
I can handle things, I'm smart!

1121
02:06:16,179 --> 02:06:21,697
Not like everybody says,
I'm smart and I want respect!

1122
02:06:26,314 --> 02:06:29,033
Tell me about the investigation.

1123
02:06:30,025 --> 02:06:32,016
The Senate lawyer,

1124
02:06:34,196 --> 02:06:35,788
he belongs to Wroth.

1125
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:44,053
Freddo,

1126
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,491
you're nothing to me now,

1127
02:06:51,003 --> 02:06:54,075
not a brother,
not a friend.

1128
02:06:55,215 --> 02:06:58,048
I don't want
to know you, or what you do.

1129
02:06:59,387 --> 02:07:03,175
I don't want to see you in hotels.
I don't want you near my house.

1130
02:07:06,894 --> 02:07:09,727
When you see our mother,
I want to know a day in advance,

1131
02:07:10,313 --> 02:07:12,144
so I won't be there.

1132
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:14,951
Understand?

1133
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:26,075
Mikey!

1134
02:07:33,294 --> 02:07:37,253
I don't want anything happenin' to ya,
not while our mother is alive.

1135
02:09:43,665 --> 02:09:44,939
Grace!

1136
02:10:09,231 --> 02:10:10,744
Go home!

1137
02:10:13,443 --> 02:10:16,037
Grace! No! Grace!

1138
02:10:59,986 --> 02:11:01,624
You promised!

1139
02:12:13,515 --> 02:12:16,825
For the last time, I heard a voice
that wasn't my mother's,

1140
02:12:17,436 --> 02:12:19,825
whispering, "Good morning, Columbus."

1141
02:12:20,395 --> 02:12:25,913
It didn't bother me. Then the voice
became lower and turned into a wind

1142
02:12:26,609 --> 02:12:30,727
that sent the peaceful smell
of cheap cologne.

1143
02:12:31,366 --> 02:12:36,440
And I realized, like Columbus, I had
to live in a world of cheap cologne,

1144
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:40,192
and I wasn't sure any discovery
in America was possible anymore.

1145
02:12:41,247 --> 02:12:43,886
Smoothing roads and counting fish
wasn't science,

1146
02:12:44,460 --> 02:12:47,213
but somehow
it prepared me for the ocean...

1147
02:12:47,795 --> 02:12:51,947
I don't know why, but my father's
words jumped back into my head,

1148
02:12:52,592 --> 02:12:54,662
that work was like a hat on your head,

1149
02:12:55,219 --> 02:12:59,053
and even if you didn't have any pants,
you shouldn't be ashamed of your ass,

1150
02:12:59,681 --> 02:13:01,399
because you had a hat.

1151
02:13:02,434 --> 02:13:06,950
And even though my uncle Leo
worked for everything he got,

1152
02:13:07,606 --> 02:13:09,437
I'm not sure he got what he needed.

1153
02:13:09,984 --> 02:13:11,975
Elaine and Grace
were really one person,

1154
02:13:12,527 --> 02:13:17,123
too big for one body, no matter how
much they loved or hated each other.

1155
02:13:19,158 --> 02:13:23,310
After the storm,
I couldn't say life was beautiful,

1156
02:13:23,955 --> 02:13:26,674
but all I kept hoping for
was the Eskimo boy in my dream

1157
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:30,447
to run out of one of these doors
and hug me.

1158
02:13:31,045 --> 02:13:36,642
Though I no longer felt like a fish,
and realized I knew nothing,

1159
02:13:37,341 --> 02:13:39,457
I was happy to be alive...

1160
02:14:56,875 --> 02:15:00,788
What a wonderful fish.
- What a wonderful fish!

1161
02:15:01,837 --> 02:15:03,873
Yes, wonderful.

1162
02:15:04,425 --> 02:15:08,338
We have to catch it today.
We will catch it today.

1163
02:15:08,971 --> 02:15:13,761
Do the eyes start
on either side of the head?

1164
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:16,741
Yes, it's a very strange fish.

1165
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:21,940
When it becomes an adult,
one eye moves across, joins the other.

1166
02:15:23,441 --> 02:15:27,434
Why do they do that?
- Maybe it's like a...

1167
02:15:31,115 --> 02:15:35,506
A badge of maturity. They passed
through the nightmare. - Nightmare?

1168
02:15:38,163 --> 02:15:41,553
The nightmare
that separates children from adults.

1169
02:15:43,042 --> 02:15:45,158
Come.
- Quickly.

1170
02:15:50,508 --> 02:15:53,580
We got it! We got it!

1171
02:15:55,179 --> 02:15:57,374
We got it! Slowly.

1172
02:15:58,057 --> 02:15:59,046
Slowly!

1173
02:16:00,142 --> 02:16:01,131
Slowly!

1174
02:16:02,060 --> 02:16:04,938
Don't move! Don't move!

1175
02:16:07,024 --> 02:16:12,576
Look, its color changes to match
the ocean floor. - Camouflage.

1176
02:16:13,279 --> 02:16:17,477
If one Arrowtooth Halibut
sinks on top of the head of another,

1177
02:16:18,117 --> 02:16:22,872
the bottom one doesn't make a fuss,
but waits until the other one moves.

1178
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:27,818
I wouldn't like anyone to sit
on my head. - You are still young.

1179
02:16:28,461 --> 02:16:31,976
One eye begins
to move to the other side.

1180
02:16:33,214 --> 02:16:38,049
Then it's better to have both eyes
on the same side? - No. Different.

1181
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:40,551
What do you lose?

1182
02:16:41,681 --> 02:16:46,709
Your other side. You lose something,
but you also gain something.

1183
02:16:47,305 --> 02:17:47,387
