3
00:00:59,963 --> 00:01:02,133
<i>Mr. Rusk?</i>

4
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:07,570
<i>Mr. Rusk.</i>

5
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:13,408
<i>Mr. Rusk?</i>

6
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,146
<i>Boss, are you there?</i>

7
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:19,214
Mia, out of curiosity,

8
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,682
what part of "hold my calls"
couldn't you wrap your head around?

9
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:23,450
I'm in a meeting.

10
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:25,932
<i>I'm sorry. It's Harold, and think
that there's something wrong.</i>

11
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:33,863
Harold? Uh...

12
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:36,831
Put him through.

13
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:39,233
<i>Richard.</i>

14
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:42,269
Harold.
What happened, buddy?

15
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,239
Why didn't you come back
with me and Elaine?

16
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:46,373
<i>Richard, I've been taken!</i>

17
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,542
Taken?

18
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:49,310
<i>Elaine, Elaine,
I've been kidnapped.</i>

19
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:54,015
- Turn it down. Turn it down.
<i>- They have a gun to my head!</i>

20
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:56,283
<i>Stop! Stop! Stop!
What are you doing?</i>

21
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:59,821
Calm down and explain, as clearly
as you can, what's going on.

22
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:02,857
<i>I am somewhere in Mexico
with a gun to my head!</i>

23
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,325
- <i>I don't know how much clearer I can be!</i>
- Holy fuck!

24
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:07,795
Harold, it's okay.
We're here.

25
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:09,863
- Um...
- Ask what they want.

26
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:11,933
What do they want?

27
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:14,569
<i>They want five million
wired to an account.</i>

28
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,703
<i>Or they're going
to hang me from the bridge!</i>

29
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:19,773
Five million what, pesos?

30
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,708
<i>Peso... Dollars!</i>

31
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,779
We're so fucked.

32
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:42,763
Harold?

33
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:45,366
Walk Riley.

34
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:46,900
<i>...and snow continues to linger.</i>

35
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,535
<i>Everyone in Chicago
is complaining,</i>

36
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,297
<i>and I say let's turn it around.</i>

37
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:01,719
Here.

38
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:05,255
- I love you.
- Mmm.

39
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:10,393
- Say hi to Stu.
- I will.

40
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:52,769
Maybe the beach holiday
will have to wait.

41
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:56,604
But I must get a second car.

42
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:58,505
- Bonnie keeps bringing it up.
- Shit.

43
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:00,006
Bonnie is the one
that's killing you.

44
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:02,844
I mean, look, don't get me wrong.
I know you love her and all.

45
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:06,012
But your wife's the reason that
that's all fucked up, okay?

46
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:09,517
The loans.
The insane office space.

47
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,653
She's got one client. She should
be working out of your garage,

48
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:14,988
not leasing space
at the damn Franklin Center.

49
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,991
Listen, as your accountant,
I have to tell you,

50
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:19,827
she's dragging you in some deep
water, Harold, like bankruptcy-deep.

51
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,964
So, you're saying
that I am cash poor?

52
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,166
No, I'm saying
you're poor-poor, nigga.

53
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:28,536
Plus, word on the street
is that Promethium

54
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:30,938
is about to be gobbled up
by Powell or AFT.

55
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,440
If there's a merger, you could
be looking for another job.

56
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:34,442
What?

57
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:38,779
I... I haven't heard
anything about that.

58
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:42,750
Look, man, I do taxes for half the
Powell brass, and this shit is real.

59
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:44,918
Stewart, Richard
wouldn't do that to me.

60
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,488
He's my friend, okay?

61
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,123
Richard has a vanity
license plate, Harold.

62
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,827
He does push-ups
in his goddamn office.

63
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:55,499
Richard would
do that to you.

64
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:09,662
Good morning. Promethium
Pharmaceuticals. How can I help you?

65
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:26,827
Harold!

66
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:29,098
Man, it's 9:20!
You're late again!

67
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,503
What do you call this?

68
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:39,207
- I think that's all, Mr. Rusk.
- All right.

69
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:41,612
- I'll see you at the game.
- Sure.

70
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:46,781
Come.

71
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:48,085
Get in here.

72
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,753
I had to do that.

73
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:55,923
Everybody knows we're friends. I
can't give you special treatment.

74
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:59,760
Sorry, Richard. Lake Shore
was crazy this morning.

75
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:01,027
Sit down.

76
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:03,798
Hey, Mia,
I'm thirsty.

77
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,065
All right.

78
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,334
You ready
for this game tonight?

79
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:09,503
Those Benson-Smith cocksuckers
are begging for an ass kicking.

80
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,104
I am gonna
give it to 'em.

81
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:12,507
- Here.
- Thank you.

82
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,642
Oh, my God.
Yeah, and then tomorrow,

83
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:16,943
you and me are gonna have
a little fun in Mexico.

84
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:18,678
What?

85
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,947
Elaine and I are gonna
join you on this trip.

86
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,750
You're not the only one who
could go for a little sunshine.

87
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:25,620
This is because
of the missing inventory.

88
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:28,221
Look, I plan to speak to Sanchez
to get to the bottom of that.

89
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:29,957
No, Elaine and I will
speak to Sanchez.

90
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,894
We just wanna check
on a few things down there.

91
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:37,031
Uh, I need you to put
all the Mexico files in this

92
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,567
and give it to Elaine.

93
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,839
Yo, thanks, buddy.

94
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:51,481
Richard.

95
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:54,615
Is everything okay here?

96
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:57,051
It's just
I heard a rumor,

97
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,889
something about
a possible merger.

98
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:05,529
Harold, listen.

99
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:11,666
When-When you needed a job
and you came to me,

100
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:15,335
I said if you stuck with me, your
life is gonna look like a rap video.

101
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:16,870
Right?

102
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:19,205
And haven't I always
looked after you?

103
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:22,008
I give you an incredible position
as operations supervisor.

104
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,109
Yes.

105
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,745
I handed you
the Mexico assignment.

106
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:25,947
Yes.

107
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,849
I give Bonnie a job
designing my loft,

108
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,752
and she has fuck-all
for experience.

109
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:33,087
That was generous.

110
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,255
Trust me.
Fucking be patient, man.

111
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:37,091
And everything's
gonna get revealed.

112
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:40,163
Why don't you
reveal it to me... now?

113
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:45,969
Have I told you
about the two gorillas?

114
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,169
All right.
I read it in this book.

115
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:50,904
Two gorillas, right?

116
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:53,073
And every day
they get fed carrots.

117
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:54,875
And every day
they eat the carrots.

118
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:57,344
No problem. Chomp, chomp, chomp.
So delicious.

119
00:07:57,346 --> 00:08:01,281
Except, one day, the handler, he
gives one of the gorillas a banana,

120
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:03,383
and the other guy
still gets his carrots,

121
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:05,652
and he doesn't wanna eat
the carrots.

122
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:08,014
You know why? 'Cause he's seen
the other guy eat the banana.

123
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:10,827
You know what I'm saying?

124
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:15,062
Harold.

125
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,702
Eat your fucking carrots.

126
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,038
'Cause I have your back, right?

127
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,877
And then you're gonna be dick-deep
in bananas before you know it.

128
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:29,243
Right?

129
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:31,113
Rap video.

130
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:34,015
Mia.

131
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:35,218
Hungry.

132
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:47,127
Receipt's in the bag.

133
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,265
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

134
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:05,748
Stop.

135
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:14,721
Wow. All of that without
professional training.

136
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:17,091
Whoo. That's good, man.

137
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:20,727
You don't have to be a dick about it.

138
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:21,729
All right.

139
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:25,366
Spunky. I like it.

140
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:27,735
You'll get far.

141
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,403
Hey, stranger.

142
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,838
Nelly.
What you doing here?

143
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,643
You disappeared on us.

144
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:37,047
Thought about
Monty's offer yet?

145
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,347
Yeah, you can't come in here
talking about that, all right?

146
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:44,085
I'm, uh... I'm working.

147
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,285
Yeah.

148
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,855
You seem... super busy.

149
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:50,356
Yeah, well these babies don't
polish themselves, all right?

150
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:52,992
So, are you in or out?

151
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,029
I can't. It's too dangerous.

152
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:58,032
Oh, come on, Miles.
Don't be a pussy.

153
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:01,068
You can do this.
Really not that hard.

154
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,504
Right. I really appreciate the pep
talk, but it ain't happening.

155
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:05,806
Look, it's just
a couple of pills

156
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:07,842
from Monty's friend
at some lab

157
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:10,276
so he can figure out
what's in it and make his own.

158
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:12,846
All you gotta do is bring 'em back.
It'll be easy.

159
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:15,915
Plus, it's a free trip to Mexico.
What more do you want?

160
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,851
Right, so I'll be like
a little drug mule.

161
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:20,013
Perfect. I'll write you a
"thank you" note from prison.

162
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:22,923
Okay. Fine.

163
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:24,958
You don't want 20 grand,

164
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,696
that's your business.

165
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:29,832
Twenty grand?
You said it was ten.

166
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:33,433
Yeah, it was.

167
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:34,738
It's 20 now.

168
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:36,372
For real?

169
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:43,877
- For real.
- Hmm.

170
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,016
Oh, and you can bring
Guitar Shop Barbie with you.

171
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,728
Sh, sh, sh.

172
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:03,099
- What was all that about?
- What?

173
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,231
That.

174
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,936
Oh, nothing.

175
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:10,173
Ever been to Mexico, babe?

176
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:34,129
Richard.

177
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:36,362
<i>Hey, listen. My lunch
meeting ran a little long.</i>

178
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:38,999
<i>I'm not gonna make it back to
the office before the game.</i>

179
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:42,168
So do you mind grabbing my bag
for me before you leave?

180
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,571
<i>It's under my desk.</i>

181
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:45,206
Uh, okay.

182
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,477
All right.
I'll see you at the gym.

183
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:51,578
Hey. Sorry.

184
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,449
Just had to deal
with something.

185
00:11:56,484 --> 00:12:00,053
Uh, Mia, Richard asked me
to grab something for the game.

186
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:01,424
Yeah.

187
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:17,264
I know, but not everything
needs to make sense, Tony.

188
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,198
Scotland Yard is in England.

189
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,271
Who the fuck
can explain that?

190
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:27,942
Now you're just
fucking boring me.

191
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:30,010
Hey. Ask you
about something?

192
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:32,645
Listen. I'm gonna give you some advice.
You listening, Tony Tones?

193
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,181
Good.

194
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:36,516
Stop crying.
Go down to unemployment.

195
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,554
Start acting
like a fucking man.

196
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:42,057
Kenny!

197
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:49,362
It's a foul.

198
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:50,697
Foul!

199
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,633
Oh.

200
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:54,304
You're kidding me!

201
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:20,260
<i>All these underclassmen</i>

202
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:22,228
<i>have really paid their dues
coming off the bench.</i>

203
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,970
How's it going
at Richard's?

204
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:29,506
Fine.

205
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:34,774
Do you have any leads
on other clients?

206
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:36,677
Stu's a little worried.

207
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,681
He was saying that your office space
might be costing a little too much.

208
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:41,683
What?

209
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:45,052
Nothing.

210
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:46,452
It's... It's fine.

211
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:00,366
I still don't understand
why she gave us her tickets.

212
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:02,101
I told you,
she's going on tour.

213
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:04,771
She needs me to pick up something
for her mum. This way.

214
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,673
What band is she in?

215
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:09,543
Please. Just be happy we
got a free trip out of it.

216
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:12,382
- I'm happy. Of course I am.
- I need to piss. Hold this a sec.

217
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,314
Look, relax.

218
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:16,986
It'll be fine, all right?

219
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:20,220
- Fucking hell, mate.
- Sorry.

220
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:21,992
Easy, tiger.

221
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,729
Harold!

222
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,601
<i>Passports and boarding passes...</i>

223
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:38,739
There it is again.
What... What is that smell?

224
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:42,012
Fat Willy's barbecue.
I always bring it for Angel.

225
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:43,644
Angel.

226
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:49,185
There you go.

227
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:52,718
Allow me to introduce
our co-presidents,

228
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,392
Mr. Rusk
and Ms. Markinson.

229
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,231
A new app. Amazing.

230
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:08,869
You know what else is amazing? Is
actually learning a foreign language.

231
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:11,441
<i>Yo quiero</i>
Taco Bell, huh?

232
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:16,345
That's sensational. Can we
get the fuck outta here?

233
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,212
Harold.
Welcome back.

234
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:55,515
This is Celerino Sanchez,
our plant manager,

235
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,487
and Roberto Vega,
his right-hand man.

236
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:02,489
All right, so you,
we need to talk to.

237
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,794
- Okay.
- Uh, you, we don't.

238
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,629
My office is this way.

239
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,632
Right.

240
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:14,803
- Sorry.
- No problem, Harold.

241
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,273
Please have a seat.

242
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:22,442
- Oh, uh...
- Thank you.

243
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,179
Harold, just sit
this one out,

244
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:26,649
and I'll come
get you after, okay?

245
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:31,353
Holy fuck.

246
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:37,423
Do they not sell condoms
down here?

247
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:39,926
Okay, Sanchez.

248
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:42,930
Do you wanna tell me
what that is?

249
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:45,199
It's an
inventory report.

250
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,933
That's right. What do you
think it's telling me?

251
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,235
Sir, you have
to understand...

252
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:51,406
Oh, just answer
the question, Suarez.

253
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:54,343
- Sanchez.
- Okay.

254
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,811
The report is telling you
that the inventory is light,

255
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:01,548
as I am still selling your
product to Señor Villegas,

256
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,749
as you requested.

257
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:04,651
We told you to cut him off.

258
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:07,354
With all due respect,
that's not the way it works.

259
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:10,223
Uh, that's exactly
how it works.

260
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:12,960
I make a product. I decide
who to sell it to. Right?

261
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:15,394
You get to decide if you want
a future with the company...

262
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:18,464
Again,
<i>con todo respeto,</i>

263
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,533
if I don't continue
to deliver,

264
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:22,903
I will have
no future at all.

265
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:24,337
When you needed money,
you asked me...

266
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:28,310
When we needed money, we asked you to
sell some product off the books...

267
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,712
and not say anything to Harold.

268
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:34,481
Now, we don't need money.
We're telling you to stop.

269
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:36,950
I really don't see what is so
difficult to understand-o.

270
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:39,619
- It's a sensitive time for the company now.
- Yes.

271
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,256
We're gonna have people coming down here,
and they're gonna look things over,

272
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:44,625
and we wanna make sure
that everything is in order.

273
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:48,561
I understand, but Señor Villegas
is expecting his usual shipment.

274
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:52,031
The Black Panther is
not someone to mess with.

275
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:55,836
You can't scare me with tales
of the big, bad cartels, right?

276
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:57,406
I know how things work.

277
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,539
Not in Mexico.

278
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,475
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
we are not in Mexico.

279
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:05,912
This is an American company
making an American product,

280
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:08,448
and I'm telling you,
in American,

281
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,049
to make sure
that the inventory's right.

282
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:13,487
Yes. I mean, if you can
take care of 35 kids,

283
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:17,290
I think you can handle
one drug dealer.

284
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,593
- No?
- <i>¿Comprende?</i>

285
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:21,631
- Okay.
- Let's go.

286
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:23,763
<i>Gracias.</i>

287
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:24,766
<i>Adiós.</i>

288
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:28,535
Have a nice day.

289
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:29,906
Harold, let's go.

290
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,520
Harold, just so you know,

291
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:49,623
the inventory thing
worried us.

292
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,958
That's why we came down here
to speak to Sanchez,

293
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,926
just to make sure everything
was on the up-and-up.

294
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:55,761
It's no reflection
on you.

295
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:59,766
No, certainly not.
You know we value your work.

296
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:03,002
- I was starting to think it might be something else.
- Well, you're hearing things.

297
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:04,604
He's hearing things.

298
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:08,942
Harold, when I was
in junior high,

299
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:12,078
a rumor went around
that I let the lacrosse team

300
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,349
pull a train on me
in the Dairy Queen parking lot.

301
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,652
I hated the lacrosse team.

302
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:21,454
They were the biggest
bunch of Waspy,

303
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:25,459
turtle-dicked ass pirates
I ever met in my entire life.

304
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,127
- Here you are, señor.
- Thank you.

305
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:32,499
And I'd rather give that waiter a rim
job than eat at a fucking Dairy Queen.

306
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:34,600
- What's a rim job?
- It's when...

307
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:36,135
Don't believe
everything you hear

308
00:20:36,137 --> 00:20:37,703
is probably
the point here, right?

309
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:39,740
Exactly.
You're gonna be fine.

310
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:41,344
We're not selling
the company.

311
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:44,313
All right?

312
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,718
I'll be right back.

313
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:54,788
I don't think
he knows anything.

314
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,891
- I almost feel bad for the guy.
- Right.

315
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:00,527
Someone should put him
out of his misery.

316
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:01,627
Seriously.

317
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:03,997
No, I mean literally.

318
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:07,437
Someone should literally put
him out of his fucking misery.

319
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:10,340
Angel.

320
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:14,106
You can go.

321
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,778
I will see you <i>mañana.</i>

322
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:19,082
Okay.

323
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,451
But when they married each
other, she was a fatty.

324
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:27,854
She was 50 pounds heavier
than she is today.

325
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:29,923
I was like,
"Don't do it."

326
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:32,459
Fat people are so funny.

327
00:21:34,163 --> 00:21:35,529
<i>Gracias.</i>

328
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,029
You wanna come
to my room tonight?

329
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:38,698
Yeah,
I'm really tired.

330
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,966
- Hey, buddy.
- What did I miss?

331
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,971
Uh, I'm gonna check some e-mails
and maybe hit the sauna

332
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:47,706
after I punch out
a little CrossFit.

333
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,911
- Then I'll see you guys in the morning.
- You sure...

334
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,525
Do you...

335
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:07,927
You know,
I'm gonna crash too.

336
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,895
It's gonna be
an early flight, so...

337
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,103
- That's it then.
- Good night.

338
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:24,547
What is your problem?
You just fucking left me.

339
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:29,115
<i>Right.</i>

340
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:31,398
<i>Someone should
put him out of his misery.</i>

341
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,521
<i>No, I mean literally.</i>

342
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:38,657
<i>Someone should literally put him
out of his fucking misery.</i>

343
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,493
<i>Well, when the sale
goes through,</i>

344
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:42,662
<i>that's the last you're
gonna see of Harold Soyinka.</i>

345
00:22:42,664 --> 00:22:45,164
<i>He is on the 86 list.</i>

346
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,067
<i>Maybe they're gonna
give him severance,</i>

347
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:50,871
<i>but I just think they're
gonna fucking clean house.</i>

348
00:22:50,873 --> 00:22:53,839
<i>His wife must be a real winner.</i>

349
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:55,208
<i>Actually, she is.</i>

350
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,077
<i>But when they married each
other, she was a fatty.</i>

351
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,946
<i>She was 50 pounds heavier
than she is today.</i>

352
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,137
Okay.

353
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,646
Richard
is supposed to be my friend.

354
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:36,616
It's unbelievable!
Just unbelievable!

355
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:38,117
<i>You have
every right to be upset.</i>

356
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,185
I swear...

357
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:43,690
I know I'm not supposed to touch the
minibar, but I'm going to do it.

358
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:46,693
I don't even care anymore. I'm doing it.
I'm having the merlot.

359
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:50,797
<i>I feel horrible.</i>

360
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,167
I should've told you
to your face.

361
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,608
What should you have
told me to my face?

362
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:02,178
- The e-mail.
- What e-mail?

363
00:24:04,046 --> 00:24:06,879
- Just go ahead with what you were saying.
- <i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

364
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:08,950
Wha-What should you
have told me?

365
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:13,686
<i>You know...</i>

366
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:17,057
<i>You know the invisible
gorilla experiment, Harold?</i>

367
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:19,826
Why is everyone talking about
gorillas all of a sudden?

368
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:22,061
There's this video, right?

369
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:24,864
Some people in black shirts.
Some people in white shirts.

370
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:27,067
And you have to count
how many times

371
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,802
the people in white shirts
pass this ball back and forth.

372
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:33,339
<i>This person in a gorilla suit walks
into the middle of the group.</i>

373
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:37,344
<i>The experiment is whether or not
you're so focused on the ball</i>

374
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:39,011
<i>that you miss the gorilla.</i>

375
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:42,081
<i>You would've been part
of the group that missed it.</i>

376
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,218
Missed what?

377
00:24:45,854 --> 00:24:47,223
<i>I'm having an affair.</i>

378
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,155
<i>I'm leaving you.</i>

379
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:51,726
That's what the e-mail says.

380
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:01,002
You didn't notice the gorilla.

381
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:06,708
So, the affair is a gorilla?

382
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,579
Yes.

383
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:12,746
Wh-What is the ball?

384
00:25:12,748 --> 00:25:14,681
<i>The ball?</i>

385
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:16,986
Is that our marriage,
the ball?

386
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,254
<i>I don't know what the ball is.</i>

387
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,592
I'm-I'm not
supposed to be...

388
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:27,760
looking for gorillas,
Bonnie.

389
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,395
I'm supposed to be
watching the ball.

390
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:30,930
<i>That's my job.</i>

391
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:32,331
I'm sorry.

392
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,769
Why am I always getting
screwed for doing my job?

393
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:37,936
Tell me who it is.
I want to know!

394
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:40,106
- Who is the gorilla, Bonnie?
- I'm sorry.

395
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:41,708
<i>Bonnie.</i>

396
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,812
Bonnie!

397
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:57,423
<i>You have
reached the voice mailbox of...</i>

398
00:25:57,425 --> 00:26:00,145
<i>- Bonnie.
- At the tone, please record your voice message...</i>

399
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:04,899
Ahh!

400
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:07,168
Oh!

401
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:11,206
No.

402
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:50,804
No?

403
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:22,228
No, no! No, no!
No, no! No! No!

404
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:02,662
- Still not answering.
- What?

405
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:04,465
Not like him at all.

406
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm not waiting
for this dipshit.

407
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:10,039
Can you just get
in the car!

408
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,106
No wait-o for dipshit-o.

409
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:15,040
Yeah, we...
We're gonna... We need...

410
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:15,775
<i>¡Ándale!</i>

411
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:18,711
I... I go to look?

412
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:20,616
- Yeah. Can you?
- Okay.

413
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:25,220
- Okay, señor.
- Perfect.

414
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:35,497
Butler!

415
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,125
Room?

416
00:32:39,593 --> 00:32:41,562
- You want a room.
- Yes. Yes.

417
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,233
With TV?

418
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:50,039
Uh... Uh, fine. Yes.

419
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,611
Uh, 300.

420
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,148
<i>Gracias.</i>

421
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:05,854
Come, come.

422
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:11,824
My name is Ronaldo, and this
is my brother, Ernesto.

423
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:16,261
Just... Just tell us
if you need something.

424
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:20,766
Okay. Uh, actually, uh, do you know
where I can buy a cheap phone?

425
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:23,105
Uh, yeah,
just across the street.

426
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:27,272
- I just don't get it.
- There's nothing to get, babe.

427
00:33:27,274 --> 00:33:29,908
Seriously. I told you,
Nelly's just a friend.

428
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,113
You gotta let it go,
all right?

429
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:54,835
No.

430
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:16,555
<i>Live life to the fullest</i>

431
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,260

<i>With Cannabax.</i>

437
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:35,374
Medical marijuana is already
a multi-billion dollar industry.

438
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:37,676
It's already up and running
in 20 states

439
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:39,711
and the District of Columbia.

440
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:43,749
If you've got a card, you can legally
rip a bong in the Lincoln bedroom.

441
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:45,153
Wow.

442
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,321
All right, look, guys,
now, legally speaking,

443
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:50,689
isn't this
right on the line?

444
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:51,790
Well, it's on it.

445
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,292
It's not over it.

446
00:34:53,294 --> 00:34:55,828
There's a reason why we
set up the lab in Mexico.

447
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,564
You could be operational the
moment the laws open up.

448
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:02,935
Marty, you-you-you really wanna
let AFT take this from you?

449
00:35:02,937 --> 00:35:05,470
You're gonna be staring at their
taillights for the rest of all time.

450
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:09,374
The future of marijuana
is this pill.

451
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:11,343
You know this product
is revolutionary.

452
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:14,312
You know that by the time
everybody else catches up,

453
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:18,250
we will have established a brand
that can never be usurped.

454
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:20,685
- Think Pfizer and Viagra.
- Yeah.

455
00:35:20,687 --> 00:35:22,758
They got there first.
There ain't no second.

456
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,263
Look...

457
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:34,570
most people will tell you
Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon.

458
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:38,970
But even a complete retard
will tell you

459
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:40,875
Neil Armstrong did it first.

460
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,778
And do you know
why he went first?

461
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,649
- He was mission commander?
- 'Cause the hatch opened on his side?

462
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:54,553
He went first because he pushed
Buzz Aldrin the fuck out of the way

463
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:56,622
and seized history
by the ball sack.

464
00:35:56,624 --> 00:36:00,495
That's the story schools are afraid
to teach, but that's what happened.

465
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:03,899
I'm satisfied.

466
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,969
Jer?

467
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:16,609
I'm still not sure
about this.

468
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:19,078
Oh, Jerry!

469
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,414
The club is closing.

470
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:24,582
We've been dancing all night.

471
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,651
It's time to go home
and fuck.

472
00:36:26,653 --> 00:36:28,020
Easy, Elaine.

473
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:29,988
What, Richard?

474
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,394
Nobody dances all night
unless they wanna fuck.

475
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:36,397
And Jerry here wants to.

476
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:40,700
He's just being shy.

477
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:42,935
I have a gun to my head.

478
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:45,870
I have a loaded gun
to my head.

479
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:47,673
Richard.

480
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:50,312
Richard!
I've been kidnapped!

481
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,450
I have a loaded gun
to my head!

482
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:59,352
So...

483
00:36:59,354 --> 00:37:01,120
you guys understand
what to do?

484
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:02,691
- Yes? <i>¿Comprende?</i>
- Yes, yes.

485
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,426
Does he <i>comprende?</i>

486
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:07,928
Okay. Good.

487
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:26,678
Richard Rusk's office.

488
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,515
<i>Mia! I need
to speak to Richard!</i>

489
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:30,649
Harold?

490
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:32,651
<i>I need to speak to Richard!</i>

491
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:35,587
<i>Mr. Rusk?</i>

492
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,089
I said hold my calls.

493
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:38,627
Mr. Rusk.

494
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:41,493
- Yeah.
- Yes.

495
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:43,062
- Yep.
- Fuck yeah.

496
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:44,384
<i>Mr. Rusk.</i>

497
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,734
- Oh, my God.
- Right, right.

498
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:50,970
<i>Mr. Rusk?</i>

499
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:54,006
- <i>Boss, are you there?</i>
- Oh, shit.

500
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:57,743
Mia, out of curiosity,
exactly what part

501
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:59,745
<i>of "hold my calls" couldn't
you wrap your head around?</i>

502
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:01,714
<i>I'm... I'm in a meeting.</i>

503
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:03,682
I'm sorry. It's Harold, and I think
that there's something wrong.

504
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:05,049
Harold?

505
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:06,051
Uh...

506
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:09,555
Yeah, put him through.

507
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:10,892
<i>Harold?</i>

508
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,030
Richard!

509
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:24,069
Where are you? Why didn't you
come back with me and Elaine?

510
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:26,971
Richard! I've been taken!

511
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:30,776
- Taken?
- Elaine? I've been kidnapped!

512
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:33,814
They have a gun to my head!
I have a loaded gun to my head!

513
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:39,752
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no! No! No!

514
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:44,055
Try and breathe and calm down and explain,
as clearly as you can, what's going on.

515
00:38:44,057 --> 00:38:47,827
I'm somewhere in Mexico with a gun to
my head! How much clearer can I be?

516
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:50,595
Harold, it's okay.
We're here.

517
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:52,598
- Um...
- Ask them what they want.

518
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,133
What do they want?

519
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:56,901
<i>They want five million
wired to an account.</i>

520
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:58,903
Or they're going to hang me
from the bridge!

521
00:38:58,905 --> 00:39:01,740
Five million what, pesos?

522
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:03,975
Peso... Dollars!

523
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:07,946
<i>Harold, how exactly
did they arrive at a number</i>

524
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:12,183
<i>like five million dollars
for a person in your position?</i>

525
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:15,053
You didn't tell them about
the K&R policy, did you?

526
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:17,689
<i>They came to the hotel
and kidnapped me.</i>

527
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,225
<i>I had no choice!</i>

528
00:39:19,227 --> 00:39:20,892
God-fucking-damn it!

529
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:22,060
We're so fucked.

530
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:23,261
- Jesus Christ!
- Shh.

531
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:25,698
The number-one rule

532
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,866
about having
the fucking insurance policy

533
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,002
<i>is never tell anyone we have
the fucking insurance policy!</i>

534
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:32,738
<i>Did you not attend the seminar?</i>

535
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,908
He set up the seminar.

536
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:37,209
Aah! No!

537
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:38,676
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

538
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:42,147
<i>No! No more!</i>

539
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:44,283
- Aah! Aah!
- Yes! Yes!

540
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:46,651
No!

541
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:50,122
Really fucking hamstrings our bargaining
position. You know that, right?

542
00:39:50,124 --> 00:39:52,725
<i>Bargaining? I just told you
they're going to kill me!</i>

543
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:56,595
Yes. Bargaining. I'm in business.
That's what I do.

544
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:59,231
You walk through warehouses,
put little check marks on boxes.

545
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,765
- That's what <i>you</i> do.
- Don't be mean.

546
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:01,901
What about the policy?

547
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:03,738
You're gonna have to tell him.

548
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:09,144
Harold, I'm just gonna spit this out.
There is no policy.

549
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,644
What?

550
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:13,678
We had to make cutbacks.

551
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,147
Uh... Fuck.

552
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:20,653
There was a lot going out. We didn't have a
lot coming in. I had to let the policy lapse.

553
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:23,756
You kept sending me
down here with no insurance?

554
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:25,323
<i>Yeah, but just
for a little while.</i>

555
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:28,560
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What a fucking crybaby.

556
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:30,828
There's not enough time
in every day

557
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,635
for us to tell you all the things
we do not need to tell you, Harold.

558
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,635
No! No! No!

559
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:37,803
Nada! No!

560
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:39,939
Oh!

561
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:41,676
Aah!

562
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:46,680
- <i>Aah!</i>
- Fucking Mexicans.

563
00:41:01,896 --> 00:41:03,928
- Harold?
- Richard!

564
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,964
All right. Hey, listen.

565
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:08,366
Harold, I am gonna get you
outta there, I swear to God.

566
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:10,202
Harold,
listen to me right now.

567
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:12,270
You tell whoever's got you

568
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:15,174
that there is no deal unless
they come way down on the price.

569
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:17,546
- What?
- Yeah, <i>la cuenta...</i>

570
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:22,915
Just... Harold,
can we call you back?

571
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,783
- What?
- <i>You got a number?</i>

572
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:27,720
- Richard. Richard.
- No, I need to speak to legal.

573
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:29,287
Richard.
Richard, don't leave me...

574
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:31,723
I'm gonna get somebody
in here who speaks Mexican.

575
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:33,191
<i>No, Richard, don't leave me here!
Richard!</i>

576
00:41:33,193 --> 00:41:34,827
- Can you call us back?
- <i>Richard!</i>

577
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:35,964
Richard!

578
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:45,874
<i>Gracias,</i> guys.

579
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:51,778
<i>Vamos.</i>

580
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:00,019
Shit.

581
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:03,921
Five million dollars for
someone in middle management.

582
00:42:03,923 --> 00:42:06,191
Do me a favor.
Just shut the fuck up.

583
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:10,428
You with your whole fucking, "Hey,
Elaine, I got the perfect guy for us.

584
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,731
My good buddy, Harold Sinka."

585
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,799
- Soyinka.
- "He's gonna fucking be perfect for the job.

586
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,968
He won't ask any questions, not
gonna cause any fucking trouble."

587
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,272
This is
a fucking clusterfuck!

588
00:42:20,106 --> 00:42:21,272
Just stay focused.

589
00:42:21,274 --> 00:42:23,077
I am focused.

590
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:30,214
What do we do now?
Do we call the cops?

591
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:33,385
Would it be such a bad thing
if he didn't come back?

592
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:35,254
What are you talking about?

593
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:38,924
We are not leaving Harold in
fucking Mexico. That's crazy.

594
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:41,026
You're the one who said
put him out of his misery.

595
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:43,796
I say crazy shit all the time.

596
00:42:43,798 --> 00:42:45,397
I don't mean it literally.

597
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,832
But you said, literally,
put him out of his misery.

598
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:52,136
Oh, my fucking...
I meant not literally literally.

599
00:42:52,138 --> 00:42:54,339
"Literally" is
something people say now.

600
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:57,008
- It doesn't mean a fucking thing.
- Okay.

601
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,011
They're going to be inspecting
the plant tomorrow,

602
00:42:59,013 --> 00:43:01,479
and if they find anything off,
this whole deal is shot.

603
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:03,716
I don't need to tell you
what's gonna happen

604
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:07,086
if the feds catch fucking
wind of any of this on any level.

605
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:08,390
We are completely fucked.

606
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:10,955
I know a guy.

607
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:12,825
Here we go again.
You know a fucking guy.

608
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:15,426
No, I know a guy who might be
really good for this kind of thing.

609
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:17,028
Extraction.

610
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,400
- Jesus Christ.
- Special ops type things.

611
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:22,203
Boy.

612
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:27,171
This is really bad timing.

613
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:29,741
Fuck this. We've got this.

614
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:31,510
Richard,
we fucking got this.

615
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:34,178
We're a team.

616
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,816
Look, why don't I come over
to your loft tonight.

617
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:40,017
We'll just...

618
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:41,539
I'm not in there yet.

619
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:43,892
I'm still at that...

620
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:46,727
boutique hotel.

621
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,131
You told me last week
you moved in.

622
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:52,497
Did I tell you that?

623
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:55,200
Did I tell... I'm
gonna make this call.

624
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:58,272
I... I'm gonna just get
this thing sorted out.

625
00:43:59,906 --> 00:44:03,107
Um, except that
if I change my mind,

626
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:05,910
I'm gonna give you a call,
which I probably will.

627
00:44:05,912 --> 00:44:08,115
But I'm, you know,
maybe just, uh...

628
00:44:09,182 --> 00:44:10,915
Whew!

629
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,984
Yeah, so...
Yeah, I'll read that.

630
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,923
Good meeting.

631
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:18,089
- Mia.
- Hmm?

632
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:19,927
Get my brother
on the phone, now.

633
00:44:28,903 --> 00:44:30,334
<i>Allô?</i>

634
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:32,037
<i>Oui.</i>

635
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:33,539
Oh, yeah. Mitch?

636
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:35,439
Yeah, one moment.

637
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:37,308
Mitch.

638
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:45,954
Okay.

639
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:50,055
Hey, Rich!

640
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:52,160
- Mitch!
- <i>How you doing, bro?</i>

641
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:55,894
How's, uh... How's Nepal?

642
00:44:55,896 --> 00:44:58,830
Uh, Haiti. I'm in Haiti.

643
00:44:58,832 --> 00:45:00,232
Haiti. No, I knew that.

644
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:02,334
How... How... How is it?

645
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:04,336
It's a fucking mess
is what it is.

646
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:06,370
Uh, we're doing what we can.

647
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:09,040
Well, you're doing
God's work, so...

648
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,912
No, the earthquake
was God's work.

649
00:45:12,111 --> 00:45:14,145
This is something else, man.

650
00:45:14,147 --> 00:45:17,950
You're seriously all, uh,
religious-y and stuff?

651
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:20,252
It's not religious.
It's spiritual.

652
00:45:20,254 --> 00:45:24,022
And I don't mock your
dirty little money-grabbing,

653
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:26,390
back-fucking-stabbing
corporate life.

654
00:45:26,392 --> 00:45:29,160
No, it's not...
Dude, I'm not, I swear to God.

655
00:45:29,162 --> 00:45:33,031
It's just... I hear through Mom that you've
turned over a new leaf, and it's great.

656
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:35,633
Mom's right. I've been good.

657
00:45:35,635 --> 00:45:38,136
I've been doing good things
with my life.

658
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:41,506
<i>I have a new path now. My mercenary
days are over. Look, what...</i>

659
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:44,276
What do you want, Richard? You only
ever call if you want something,

660
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:46,645
so let's get to that part... the
greedy part, the selfish part.

661
00:45:46,647 --> 00:45:49,414
All right.
You wanna help people, right?

662
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:52,618
You wanna help people. Help me, and
I will make it worth your while.

663
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,053
And then you can build
these people a schoolhouse

664
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:58,055
or a fucking GAP,
whatever the fuck they need.

665
00:45:58,057 --> 00:46:01,125
You know, might I remind you that
you were sent there six months ago

666
00:46:01,127 --> 00:46:04,162
to make a diplomat disappear.

667
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:06,064
You want me
to fucking kill somebody?

668
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:08,232
- <i>Have you lost your fucking mind?</i>
- Hey, man...

669
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:10,401
<i>Did you not hear anything
I just fucking said?</i>

670
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:15,540
I... I don't want... want you
to take anybody out for me.

671
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:19,981
I'm just... No, I need you
to bring somebody back.

672
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:32,691
- What phone is that?
- Hmm? Work gave it to me.

673
00:46:37,932 --> 00:46:41,135
Hey, look. That's that guy
from the room next to ours.

674
00:46:42,435 --> 00:46:44,269
Nice suit.

675
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:46,951
Why would somebody wearing a posh
suit be staying at our shit motel?

676
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:53,145
Miles, he has that, like, shoulder
holster gun thing under his arms.

677
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:55,080
Maybe he's a cop.

678
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:56,682
Or he's like a FBI guy.

679
00:46:56,684 --> 00:46:59,584
Or, no, a DEA guy.
Yeah, he's a DEA guy,

680
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,720
on the trail
of some big drug thing,

681
00:47:01,722 --> 00:47:03,421
and he's about
to bust somebody.

682
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,122
Oh, yeah,
somebody's going down.

683
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:06,691
All right,
let's go, shall we?

684
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:09,373
- But I haven't finished my margarita yet.
- You can get more later.

685
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:14,902
Babe, we're in Mexico. They brush their
teeth with tequila. Let's do it.

686
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:18,038
Amigo!

687
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:14,329
Oh, for fuck's sake.

688
00:48:18,164 --> 00:48:20,100
Are you crying?

689
00:48:22,502 --> 00:48:24,803
I'm sorry.

690
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:27,138
Did you not smoke every girl

691
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,409
in every fucking pageant
you ever entered?

692
00:48:30,544 --> 00:48:32,146
That's what I thought.

693
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,084
You're a winner, Elaine.

694
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:40,254
You've always been a winner.

695
00:48:43,823 --> 00:48:46,557
Who is Daddy's blue-ribbon girl?

696
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,125
Hmm?

697
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,761
That's right.

698
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,165
I am.

699
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:55,403
I'm the blue-ribbon girl.

700
00:48:58,805 --> 00:49:00,738
Now, get your shit together.

701
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:03,410
Go handle your business.

702
00:49:38,144 --> 00:49:41,379
Richard, it's me.

703
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:43,214
No. No, no, no, no. Shut up.

704
00:49:43,216 --> 00:49:44,448
Shut up and let me
do the talking.

705
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,521
<i>Hola. Hola, amigo.</i>

706
00:49:48,254 --> 00:49:49,520
<i>Hola,</i> shithead.

707
00:49:49,522 --> 00:49:50,721
Better.

708
00:49:50,723 --> 00:49:52,524
<i>Hola,</i> shithead. It's me.

709
00:49:52,526 --> 00:49:55,760
Shut up. Now, I know
what you've been doing.

710
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:59,531
And I know about all these people are
going to lose their job, including me.

711
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:02,299
And I know that you
and Elaine are having sex.

712
00:50:02,301 --> 00:50:04,336
Richard,
you are a bad person.

713
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:05,870
You know what happens
to bad people?

714
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:07,272
Bad things.

715
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:09,207
Bad things happen
to bad people.

716
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:13,310
So you can...
you can take your... carrot

717
00:50:13,312 --> 00:50:18,482
and shove it up your
motherfucking lying buttocks,

718
00:50:18,484 --> 00:50:22,254
because I can have bananas.

719
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:25,156
Harold Soyinka can have
all the bananas.

720
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,593
I'll have my bananas.

721
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:34,665
Oh, God. Phone.

722
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,801
It's that weird number.

723
00:50:36,803 --> 00:50:38,669
Don't. Don't touch it.

724
00:50:38,671 --> 00:50:40,638
You think it's him?

725
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,506
Just don't think about it.

726
00:50:42,508 --> 00:50:44,375
God, I'm such a shit.

727
00:50:44,377 --> 00:50:47,912
Bonnie, stop singing
sad Harold songs.

728
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:51,482
I mean, how many times do I have
to tell you? Guilt is for losers.

729
00:50:51,484 --> 00:50:54,718
Now, you want something,
you go after it.

730
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,854
You fucking
make it happen.

731
00:50:56,856 --> 00:50:59,624
Harold? He just...
He never understood that.

732
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:02,761
Now, I'm sorry.
He is a nice guy, but,

733
00:51:02,763 --> 00:51:06,263
you know, he never
fucking grew a pair.

734
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:08,301
So it's that simple.

735
00:51:09,635 --> 00:51:10,804
I know.

736
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:15,409
Thank you.

737
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:24,381
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

738
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:30,321
Who could that be?

739
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:31,423
I don't know.

740
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:45,636
- Surprise.
- Oh. Elaine.

741
00:51:45,638 --> 00:51:48,406
Uh... Okay.

742
00:51:52,646 --> 00:51:55,680
So I see you moved in
after all.

743
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:58,249
Uh, yeah.

744
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:00,718
Who do we have here,
Richard?

745
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,856
Hmm?

746
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,194
Do you have a name?

747
00:52:08,394 --> 00:52:09,829
It's a deaf girl.

748
00:52:10,664 --> 00:52:11,962
She's adorable.

749
00:52:11,964 --> 00:52:13,999
Hello, deaf girl.

750
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:15,600
Bonnie, Elaine.
Elaine, Bonnie.

751
00:52:15,602 --> 00:52:17,801
Bonnie is my...

752
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:19,803
She...
My interior decorator.

753
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:21,506
That's interesting,
because I thought you said

754
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,575
Harold's wife was
your interior decorator.

755
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:24,678
Yeah.

756
00:52:25,778 --> 00:52:27,345
- Oh.
- Yeah.

757
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:29,714
Now I see why you wanted
to leave him in Mexico.

758
00:52:29,716 --> 00:52:31,348
What?

759
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,354
Elaine.

760
00:52:34,854 --> 00:52:37,789
Ooh. Would you show me
your stomach?

761
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:40,591
'Cause I am
super curious.

762
00:52:40,593 --> 00:52:42,794
Excuse me?

763
00:52:42,796 --> 00:52:45,529
Richard here told me you were a
little fatty Patty back in the day.

764
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:46,600
Isn't that right,
Richard?

765
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:53,705
You know,
I've always wondered

766
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:56,975
what do they do
with all that... extra skin?

767
00:52:56,977 --> 00:52:58,443
Ugh!

768
00:52:58,445 --> 00:53:02,346
Listen, I don't know
what is going on...

769
00:53:02,348 --> 00:53:04,517
That's right.
You don't know anything.

770
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:09,656
And you certainly
don't know this guy.

771
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:13,924
And I bet you don't know

772
00:53:13,926 --> 00:53:16,794
what I had on the plane
to Mexico yesterday.

773
00:53:16,796 --> 00:53:18,629
I don't care what you
had on the plane.

774
00:53:18,631 --> 00:53:19,863
The petite filet.

775
00:53:19,865 --> 00:53:22,366
Four glasses of champagne

776
00:53:22,368 --> 00:53:24,905
and Richard's cock in my mouth
in the first-class bathroom.

777
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:31,843
Oh!

778
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:34,714
It's... Bonnie, she...

779
00:53:38,718 --> 00:53:40,352
Come on, Riley.

780
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,975
Now, what do you say we
christen this fucking place?

781
00:54:11,885 --> 00:54:14,118
"Live by the rules."

782
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,453
That is
what my father said.

783
00:54:16,455 --> 00:54:20,524
"Work hard, respect the boss,
and you become rich in America.

784
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:23,395
Then you can come back home
a great success."

785
00:54:23,397 --> 00:54:24,962
Bullshit.

786
00:54:24,964 --> 00:54:29,033
- One hundred percent bullshit.
- Bullshit.

787
00:54:29,035 --> 00:54:33,037
Just the other day, Richard invited
me into his office to play chess.

788
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,841
He wanted to show me how much he had
improved since we were at college.

789
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:39,176
So, he's playing white,

790
00:54:39,178 --> 00:54:42,647
and he begins with f3.

791
00:54:42,649 --> 00:54:46,417
Naturally,
I respond with e5.

792
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:48,752
Huh? What does
this crazy man do? G4.

793
00:54:48,754 --> 00:54:50,888
Can you believe it? G4.

794
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:54,024
All I have to do
is move my queen to h4.

795
00:54:54,026 --> 00:54:55,693
Checkmate.

796
00:54:55,695 --> 00:54:57,694
But did I do it?

797
00:54:57,696 --> 00:54:58,997
No. Why?

798
00:54:58,999 --> 00:55:01,665
Because I had my father's
voice in my head.

799
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:05,136
"Respect the rules."

800
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:07,839
As a rule, you do not
defeat your boss,

801
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:09,640
especially when you
want a promotion.

802
00:55:09,642 --> 00:55:14,479
That is the story
of my time in America.

803
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:17,080
Play by the rules?

804
00:55:17,082 --> 00:55:18,586
Bullshit.

805
00:55:30,062 --> 00:55:31,995
Are they your friends?

806
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:32,997
Ah.

807
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,073
Friendly.

808
00:55:49,816 --> 00:55:51,986
Where...
Where is this other bar?

809
00:55:53,954 --> 00:55:56,587
<i>Señor, donde...</i>

810
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:58,591
<i>donde</i> the, uh...
the other bar?

811
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:17,674
I need the bathroom.
Amigo.

812
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:19,914
Amigo, I need the bath...

813
00:57:53,872 --> 00:57:55,275
Mm-hmm.

814
00:57:58,278 --> 00:57:59,546
Yeah.

815
00:58:41,086 --> 00:58:44,656
Monarch butterflies go through
four generations each year.

816
00:58:44,658 --> 00:58:48,792
The first three generations hatch from their
cocoon state and live for up to six weeks,

817
00:58:48,794 --> 00:58:53,698
but the fourth generation continues to
live on for up to six or eight months...

818
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,267
so that they can migrate
to a warmer climate

819
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:59,102
and birth a new generation
in the spring.

820
00:58:59,104 --> 00:59:02,205
They are one of the great
miracles of nature.

821
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:06,780
- I've gotta go, baby. Sorry.
- What?

822
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:10,180
Babe.

823
00:59:10,182 --> 00:59:13,887
- If you want to take pictures, you can do it.
- What the fuck?

824
00:59:28,133 --> 00:59:30,303
Babe, how many butterflies
do you need to see? Really.

825
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:36,174
- What are we doing?
- What?

826
00:59:36,176 --> 00:59:39,077
- Why are you with me?
- Here we go.

827
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,345
I'm serious, Miles.
Why are you with me?

828
00:59:41,347 --> 00:59:43,848
I don't know, Sunny.
Why are you with me?

829
00:59:45,251 --> 00:59:46,954
Fucking hell.

830
00:59:50,189 --> 00:59:52,423
That guy looks like
he needs help.

831
00:59:52,425 --> 00:59:56,894
- Well, hopefully someone will pick him up.
- That's the guy from the plaza.

832
00:59:56,896 --> 00:59:58,495
- The one with the shoulder holster?
- Stop the car.

833
00:59:58,497 --> 01:00:01,799
- I'm not stopping the car for a fucking DEA agent.
- Stop the fucking car, Miles!

834
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:03,337
Please.

835
01:00:03,903 --> 01:00:05,205
Sunny.

836
01:00:06,171 --> 01:00:07,675
You okay?

837
01:00:08,975 --> 01:00:11,374
- Sunny!
- Oh, my God!

838
01:00:11,376 --> 01:00:15,178
Are you all right? Sir? Sir,
can you hear me? Please?

839
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:18,749
- Sunny, don't touch him!
- Oh, God, he's... Help me, Miles.

840
01:00:18,751 --> 01:00:20,954
This is good. This is good.

841
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:28,095
Right, we're here.

842
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:45,142
- Mr. Rusk?
- <i>What?</i>

843
01:00:45,144 --> 01:00:48,111
I was just wondering
about Harold.

844
01:00:48,113 --> 01:00:50,180
<i>What about him?</i>

845
01:00:50,182 --> 01:00:54,120
Well, he didn't sound so good yesterday,
and he didn't call in today. Is he okay?

846
01:00:56,522 --> 01:01:02,863
Mia, a simple quiz. The job of a receptionist
is to A: Make calls or B: Answer them?

847
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:05,562
B?

848
01:01:05,564 --> 01:01:07,932
B, yeah. Is this everything?

849
01:01:07,934 --> 01:01:12,370
All company policies contracts,
leases, travel and insurance riders.

850
01:01:12,372 --> 01:01:16,439
Okay, great. Hey, great
game the other night.

851
01:01:16,441 --> 01:01:18,910
Uh, I'll be
in the conference room.

852
01:01:18,912 --> 01:01:20,444
No more interruptions.

853
01:01:20,446 --> 01:01:22,312
Yes, sir, Mr. Rusk, sir.

854
01:01:22,314 --> 01:01:25,149
Keep that up, you'll
passive-aggressive yourself

855
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:29,086
straight to the unemployment line, then you'll
have plenty of time to worry about Harold.

856
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:30,354
Asshole.

857
01:01:33,459 --> 01:01:36,394
- Hello.
- <i>Rich, it's Mitch.</i>

858
01:01:36,396 --> 01:01:39,062
Oh. Mitch.

859
01:01:39,064 --> 01:01:41,566
Hey. Oh, thank God.

860
01:01:41,568 --> 01:01:44,000
Yeah, t-t-tell me
you found him.

861
01:01:44,002 --> 01:01:46,336
I've tracked down dictators
in caves, Richard.

862
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:47,974
I can find a guy
in middle management.

863
01:01:49,408 --> 01:01:51,475
Miles will be back soon
with your painkillers.

864
01:01:51,477 --> 01:01:53,413
Those are gonna make you
feel a lot better.

865
01:01:55,881 --> 01:01:59,850
Listen, you are very kind, but,
really, I will be okay on my own.

866
01:01:59,852 --> 01:02:02,520
I think you ought to have someone
just keep an eye on you.

867
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:03,924
You're really beat up.

868
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:08,258
I'm Sunny, by the way.

869
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,629
I've never met anyone
named Sunny before.

870
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:17,004
Well, I never met a Harold.
So we're even stephen.

871
01:02:20,573 --> 01:02:22,973
You know, if you
google the name Harold,

872
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:27,879
it's the most common name with the least
amount of famous people associated with it.

873
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:30,314
Well,
why don't you go by Harry?

874
01:02:30,316 --> 01:02:34,385
There are a lot of famous Harrys, like
that magician with the water tank.

875
01:02:34,387 --> 01:02:36,153
- Houdini.
- Yeah.

876
01:02:36,155 --> 01:02:39,323
And Harry S. Truman,
the president.

877
01:02:39,325 --> 01:02:43,294
And lots of singers.
Harry Potter, obviously.

878
01:02:43,296 --> 01:02:45,832
I love Harry Potter.
I've read every single book.

879
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:50,133
Harry.

880
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:53,136
- Harry Soyinka.
- Yeah, I like that.

881
01:02:53,138 --> 01:02:57,240
Okay, it's official. I'm gonna
call you Harry from now on.

882
01:03:07,352 --> 01:03:09,712
I've got Jerry on line one.

883
01:03:14,126 --> 01:03:16,627
Hey, Jerry.

884
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:18,162
<i>Elaine.</i>

885
01:03:18,164 --> 01:03:20,631
I heard AFT was crying
when they got the news.

886
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:23,433
<i>Guess they felt like they
danced with you all night too.</i>

887
01:03:23,435 --> 01:03:27,037
- <i>Someone's gotta go home alone, right?</i>
- Unless you're into threesomes.

888
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:36,680
Uh, Elaine, so, uh, anyway,

889
01:03:36,682 --> 01:03:38,682
been going over our departments.

890
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:40,551
A lot of redundancies.

891
01:03:40,553 --> 01:03:42,252
Fire whoever you want.

892
01:03:42,254 --> 01:03:44,421
<i>Well, the problem might be
right at the top.</i>

893
01:03:44,423 --> 01:03:47,627
<i>With me and Marty, we're not
gonna need both you and Richard.</i>

894
01:03:49,095 --> 01:03:51,031
Have you guys talked about this?

895
01:03:56,269 --> 01:04:00,270
Hey, Jer, how about you and I get
together for a drink tonight?

896
01:04:00,272 --> 01:04:03,040
<i>Bat a few ideas around.
I don't know.</i>

897
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:05,609
Well... Well, yeah. Okay.

898
01:04:05,611 --> 01:04:08,178
I'll let my secretary
get you all the information.

899
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,314
- That's great.
- Great.

900
01:04:10,316 --> 01:04:12,749
Hey, Elaine...

901
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:14,053
Hello?

902
01:04:32,537 --> 01:04:34,340
Fuck!

903
01:04:39,044 --> 01:04:43,414
Relax, Richard. It's under control.
This is a midnight run.

904
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:45,348
Well, let's just talk about
the money later, okay?

905
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:48,319
<i>Richie, we'll talk about
the money now, all right?</i>

906
01:04:48,321 --> 01:04:50,388
You tend to have a faulty
memory where money's concerned.

907
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,223
<i>None of your business bullshit.</i>

908
01:04:53,225 --> 01:04:57,060
One million for the ransom, 200
grand for me and the Haiti kids.

909
01:04:57,062 --> 01:04:58,631
A million dollars.

910
01:05:00,332 --> 01:05:03,133
A million dollars
for Harold Soyinka.

911
01:05:03,135 --> 01:05:06,604
That's like paying a thousand
bucks for a Whopper Jr.

912
01:05:06,606 --> 01:05:10,674
Yeah, well, think of it
as karma for banging his wife.

913
01:05:10,676 --> 01:05:15,078
Great, just... just a million!
Just go do whatever you do.

914
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,651
All right. He'll be on
the next plane to Chicago.

915
01:05:25,158 --> 01:05:26,193
Thank you.

916
01:05:31,129 --> 01:05:34,131
I... I know that whatever happened
to you is none of my business,

917
01:05:34,133 --> 01:05:36,269
but is there anybody
that you need to call?

918
01:05:38,437 --> 01:05:39,573
Uh...

919
01:05:40,705 --> 01:05:42,642
no.

920
01:05:43,742 --> 01:05:45,544
My wife just left me.

921
01:05:49,314 --> 01:05:51,417
But what about friends?

922
01:05:52,551 --> 01:05:54,320
There's no one to call.

923
01:06:01,394 --> 01:06:03,627
Well...

924
01:06:03,629 --> 01:06:07,434
I like the way you talk, Harry. You have
a really cool accent. Are you Jamaican?

925
01:06:09,367 --> 01:06:11,368
- No.
- Oh.

926
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:13,504
I'm Nigerian.

927
01:06:13,506 --> 01:06:17,441
I don't know much about Nigeria, except
once I got an e-mail from a Nigerian prince

928
01:06:17,443 --> 01:06:20,180
saying that he would give me a ton
of money if I helped him out.

929
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:25,149
You didn't send him
the money, did you?

930
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,350
'Cause you might have been
sending it to my uncle.

931
01:06:27,352 --> 01:06:29,185
Your uncle does that?

932
01:06:29,187 --> 01:06:32,388
Like, try and steal
from people like that?

933
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:34,593
Yes, he's one of those people.

934
01:06:36,428 --> 01:06:40,497
He tried to get my father
to join him, but he would not.

935
01:06:40,499 --> 01:06:44,834
Now my uncle has lots of houses,
land, sports cars, and a yacht,

936
01:06:44,836 --> 01:06:46,772
and my father is a poor man.

937
01:06:48,673 --> 01:06:50,674
The world is upside down, Sunny.

938
01:06:50,676 --> 01:06:53,910
I don't think it pays
to be a good person.

939
01:06:53,912 --> 01:06:56,446
I mean, look at you.
You seem to be a good person.

940
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:59,249
Do you have a sports car?
Do you have a yacht?

941
01:06:59,251 --> 01:07:01,754
I don't need
a sports car or a yacht.

942
01:07:05,691 --> 01:07:09,894
Well, I'm glad you didn't
help my uncle pay for his.

943
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:13,330
I think you're wrong, Harry.
I think the world is just fine.

944
01:07:13,332 --> 01:07:16,502
I think it's some of the
people in it who are wrong.

945
01:07:19,205 --> 01:07:23,339
Trust me.
I have good instincts.

946
01:07:23,341 --> 01:07:26,243
I make bad decisions,
but I have good instincts.

947
01:07:26,245 --> 01:07:30,346
You'll see, things are gonna
start to get better for you.

948
01:07:30,348 --> 01:07:32,716
Harry!

949
01:07:32,718 --> 01:07:34,285
What's going...

950
01:07:36,756 --> 01:07:39,326
Wait!

951
01:07:40,959 --> 01:07:44,694
Okay, okay, okay.

952
01:07:44,696 --> 01:07:46,664
- Put it on!
- What-What? I don't understand!

953
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:49,399
In your face!
In your head!

954
01:07:49,401 --> 01:07:51,202
- Your head!
- In your head!

955
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:53,370
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Put it on!

956
01:07:53,372 --> 01:07:54,738
Put it on!

957
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,307
Harry!

958
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:57,674
Harry.

959
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:08,352
Sunny?

960
01:08:08,354 --> 01:08:10,790
So I couldn't get
Paracetamol, but I did...

961
01:08:23,635 --> 01:08:26,302
- Uh, oh! Ooh!
- Shh. Richard sent me.

962
01:08:26,304 --> 01:08:27,740
- Let's go.
- Okay.

963
01:08:32,877 --> 01:08:34,912
What about the ransom?
Why didn't they pay the ransom?

964
01:08:34,914 --> 01:08:36,847
Who gives a fuck
about the ransom?

965
01:08:36,849 --> 01:08:39,352
I'm gonna have you back in
the States in time for dinner.

966
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:57,736
Mm.

967
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:06,276
- Sunny.
- Miles?

968
01:09:06,278 --> 01:09:08,279
- Miles!
- Sunny?

969
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:09,480
Miles?

970
01:09:09,482 --> 01:09:11,281
Miles.

971
01:09:11,283 --> 01:09:12,982
- Sunny!
- Miles, I'm in here!

972
01:09:12,984 --> 01:09:15,519
- Oh.
- Are you...

973
01:09:15,521 --> 01:09:17,521
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine!

974
01:09:17,523 --> 01:09:18,989
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

975
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:20,591
What time is it?

976
01:09:20,593 --> 01:09:22,959
What? I don't know.

977
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:25,296
- Oh, no.
- What?

978
01:09:25,298 --> 01:09:26,298
Uh...

979
01:09:27,732 --> 01:09:29,033
Oh, fuck.

980
01:09:30,368 --> 01:09:33,070
- I've gotta go. Um...
- What?

981
01:09:33,072 --> 01:09:34,905
I'm really sorry, babe.

982
01:09:34,907 --> 01:09:37,341
Go to my room.
Lock the door.

983
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:38,741
Where are you going?

984
01:09:38,743 --> 01:09:40,647
I'll be back soon.

985
01:10:05,571 --> 01:10:06,970
- Ah.
- Beginner.

986
01:10:06,972 --> 01:10:08,739
Ah.

987
01:10:08,741 --> 01:10:10,710
Ah, <i>sí.</i>

988
01:10:12,545 --> 01:10:13,545
No.

989
01:10:19,551 --> 01:10:20,551
Hmm?

990
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:28,491
Harold.

991
01:10:28,493 --> 01:10:30,093
Harold!

992
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:31,829
Uhh!

993
01:10:31,831 --> 01:10:33,566
Ohh!

994
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,570
Harold, come back here!
Harold!

995
01:10:39,037 --> 01:10:41,805
Stop! Shit. S-Stop.

996
01:10:41,807 --> 01:10:43,106
Stop!

997
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:45,445
Stop! Shit!

998
01:10:50,683 --> 01:10:51,718
Sorry.

999
01:10:52,852 --> 01:10:54,586
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

1000
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,803
Hey!

1001
01:11:33,658 --> 01:11:35,527
Okay.

1002
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:47,941
Ah, the genius wakes.

1003
01:11:49,442 --> 01:11:51,074
So...

1004
01:11:51,076 --> 01:11:53,811
riddle me something,
shithead.

1005
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:58,481
Why does a man run away from
someone who's saved his life?

1006
01:11:58,483 --> 01:12:00,919
Hmm? You don't know?

1007
01:12:02,153 --> 01:12:03,587
All right.

1008
01:12:06,224 --> 01:12:08,527
Harold, who are these two?

1009
01:12:10,094 --> 01:12:12,762
They are tourists
from the motel.

1010
01:12:12,764 --> 01:12:15,667
Really? You sure?

1011
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:21,939
What about
those two assholes?

1012
01:12:21,941 --> 01:12:25,042
They-They run the motel.

1013
01:12:25,044 --> 01:12:26,642
They run the motel?

1014
01:12:26,644 --> 01:12:29,111
Mm.

1015
01:12:30,982 --> 01:12:33,816
You weren't kidnapped,
were you?

1016
01:12:33,818 --> 01:12:35,421
You set this up yourself.

1017
01:12:36,822 --> 01:12:39,789
On the one hand, I am
surprised you had the balls.

1018
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:41,824
On the other...

1019
01:12:41,826 --> 01:12:44,830
this shit show can only be
the work of a fucking amateur.

1020
01:12:46,599 --> 01:12:49,266
Why'd you do it?
Money?

1021
01:12:49,268 --> 01:12:50,904
Revenge 'cause he was
banging your wife?

1022
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,075
You-You didn't know?

1023
01:12:57,142 --> 01:12:58,644
Ah, shit.

1024
01:13:00,012 --> 01:13:02,115
Try not to take it
too personally.

1025
01:13:06,285 --> 01:13:08,752
I thought he was my friend.

1026
01:13:08,754 --> 01:13:13,556
Remember the, uh, story
about five years ago,

1027
01:13:13,558 --> 01:13:17,895
a woman in Pennsylvania
kept a black bear as a pet.

1028
01:13:17,897 --> 01:13:23,699
She looked after it, fed it. And then
one day, it mauled her, you know?

1029
01:13:23,701 --> 01:13:25,668
She's shocked.

1030
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:27,773
I mean, she-she thought
they were friends.

1031
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:33,012
But it's a fucking bear,
Harold.

1032
01:13:37,182 --> 01:13:38,182
Yeah.

1033
01:13:40,118 --> 01:13:42,151
We're gonna need
a couple of new passports

1034
01:13:42,153 --> 01:13:46,155
after, uh, that incident
at the airport.

1035
01:13:46,157 --> 01:13:49,062
Who'd you wanna be? I'm gonna
let you choose your own name.

1036
01:13:50,929 --> 01:13:53,163
You're forging passports?

1037
01:13:53,165 --> 01:13:57,066
This is a magic box, my friend.

1038
01:13:57,068 --> 01:13:59,735
I've been 25 different people
in my life,

1039
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:04,040
and the 200 grand
I'm getting for your ass

1040
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:06,275
is going right
into my little account

1041
01:14:06,277 --> 01:14:08,110
in the Grand Caymans.

1042
01:14:08,112 --> 01:14:10,713
- Two hundred thousand?
- Yep.

1043
01:14:13,352 --> 01:14:15,252
Is that all I'm worth?

1044
01:14:15,254 --> 01:14:18,221
No, no. I was authorized
to go as high as a million.

1045
01:14:18,223 --> 01:14:21,792
Richard's gonna be so happy
that he doesn't have to pay it.

1046
01:14:21,794 --> 01:14:24,360
He's such a greedy fucker.

1047
01:14:24,362 --> 01:14:26,329
So they do know
you have me?

1048
01:14:26,331 --> 01:14:29,165
No, not yet.

1049
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:32,804
Why would you settle for 200 thousand
when you can make more than double that?

1050
01:14:38,911 --> 01:14:40,179
Oh, Harold.

1051
01:14:41,847 --> 01:14:43,879
You wanna go for the ransom?

1052
01:14:43,881 --> 01:14:47,284
Why not? You've already
done the hard part.

1053
01:14:47,286 --> 01:14:49,686
You have me, you have
the offshore account.

1054
01:14:49,688 --> 01:14:50,921
Look at me.

1055
01:14:50,923 --> 01:14:53,289
I have no job to go
back to, no wife.

1056
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:55,891
Why do you think I ran?
I cannot go back to Chicago.

1057
01:14:55,893 --> 01:14:57,996
My life there
has been a complete lie.

1058
01:14:59,063 --> 01:15:00,830
You're waking up, Harold.

1059
01:15:00,832 --> 01:15:03,702
I like that.

1060
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,676
That's a lot of food packs.

1061
01:15:11,943 --> 01:15:13,845
Medical supplies.

1062
01:15:16,782 --> 01:15:18,151
All right. Done.

1063
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:21,787
You have a deal, my friend.

1064
01:15:23,222 --> 01:15:26,722
But you can forget
about a 50-50 split.

1065
01:15:26,724 --> 01:15:30,860
I could kill you right now, tell
them that you're still alive

1066
01:15:30,862 --> 01:15:32,999
and blow off
with the whole million.

1067
01:15:35,733 --> 01:15:38,271
But I'm not gonna do that,
Harold. I've changed.

1068
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,076
Freedom, huh?

1069
01:15:45,076 --> 01:15:48,744
Eighty-twenty...
'cause I like you.

1070
01:15:48,746 --> 01:15:50,983
You got an underdog thing
going on, Harold.

1071
01:15:52,017 --> 01:15:53,353
Reminds me of the Haitians.

1072
01:16:04,228 --> 01:16:06,730
- What is that?
- It's an injectable microchip.

1073
01:16:06,732 --> 01:16:08,931
- I need to keep track of you.
- I won't run again.

1074
01:16:08,933 --> 01:16:11,467
- I promise I won't run again.
- Harold. Harold, I can't take the chance.

1075
01:16:11,469 --> 01:16:13,436
No, no! Aah!
I don't like needles!

1076
01:16:13,438 --> 01:16:16,172
- Just give me... Look away. Look away.
- No, no, no! No, please!

1077
01:16:16,174 --> 01:16:18,909
It's over. It's over.

1078
01:16:18,911 --> 01:16:21,177
- Motherfucker!
- It's over, man. Shit.

1079
01:16:23,182 --> 01:16:24,914
Elaine,
this is really fun.

1080
01:16:24,916 --> 01:16:26,749
So glad you made that call.

1081
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,418
You called me, Jerry.

1082
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:31,053
You're right.

1083
01:16:31,055 --> 01:16:32,357
Hey, here's a toast.

1084
01:16:33,991 --> 01:16:36,028
To Neil Armstrong.

1085
01:16:38,162 --> 01:16:42,332
Yeah, it's been
a great night, Jerry,

1086
01:16:42,334 --> 01:16:46,269
but we should probably start talking
some business, don't you think?

1087
01:16:46,271 --> 01:16:48,875
Oh, let's relax, Elaine.
Business isn't going anywhere.

1088
01:16:50,241 --> 01:16:54,077
I was thinking maybe
we keep it personal tonight.

1089
01:16:55,981 --> 01:16:58,414
Dance till the club closes,

1090
01:16:58,416 --> 01:16:59,882
if you catch my meaning.

1091
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,856
You dirty dog.

1092
01:17:06,524 --> 01:17:08,124
Okay.

1093
01:17:08,126 --> 01:17:10,062
All right, well,
let's have a look at it.

1094
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:13,296
What?

1095
01:17:13,298 --> 01:17:15,902
Let's see what
you're working with.

1096
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:20,406
I am catching
your meaning, right?

1097
01:17:23,407 --> 01:17:27,343
I'm not gonna... I'm not... I'm not.
I'm not... I'm not...

1098
01:17:27,345 --> 01:17:30,849
Go on, Jerry.
Just toss it against your thigh.

1099
01:17:31,849 --> 01:17:33,251
No one's looking.

1100
01:17:37,156 --> 01:17:40,859
Look, you take that baby out,
and if I like what I see...

1101
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,996
I'll let you take me
home tonight.

1102
01:17:47,366 --> 01:17:52,101
But if I don't think that's up to snuff, then,
well, we start talking business right now.

1103
01:17:52,103 --> 01:17:53,305
What do you say?

1104
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,854
Let me tell you why
you don't need Richard.

1105
01:18:27,973 --> 01:18:29,873
<i>This is fantastic, Mitch.</i>

1106
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:32,074
Really impressive.

1107
01:18:32,076 --> 01:18:33,478
Well, it's not
my first rodeo.

1108
01:18:36,447 --> 01:18:38,414
- Oh.
- It's Richard.

1109
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:41,051
Get out of the frame.

1110
01:18:41,053 --> 01:18:42,789
Don't say a word.

1111
01:18:49,193 --> 01:18:51,026
Hey. Hey, Rich.

1112
01:18:51,028 --> 01:18:54,998
Uh, listen, man,
extraction's looking iffy.

1113
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,199
I don't want
an extraction anymore.

1114
01:18:57,201 --> 01:19:01,204
Good. Good, 'cause
the deal's the way to go.

1115
01:19:01,206 --> 01:19:04,207
- There's not gonna be a deal either.
- What?

1116
01:19:04,209 --> 01:19:06,342
What do you mean?

1117
01:19:06,344 --> 01:19:10,247
It seems that while we dropped
the kidnap and ransom policy

1118
01:19:10,249 --> 01:19:14,351
there was another policy that we
overlooked: corporate life insurance.

1119
01:19:14,353 --> 01:19:16,289
Overlooked?

1120
01:19:18,223 --> 01:19:21,394
If Harold were to...

1121
01:19:23,362 --> 01:19:26,532
end up dead while conducting
business in a foreign country...

1122
01:19:29,233 --> 01:19:32,601
this would pay out five million
dollars to the corporation.

1123
01:19:32,603 --> 01:19:35,106
Hmm. Yeah.

1124
01:19:37,108 --> 01:19:41,578
Yeah, well, that... that's
not a deal I'm willing to do.

1125
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,314
Don't start with any of this, "I'm
not gonna take anyone out for you!"

1126
01:19:44,316 --> 01:19:47,449
Okay, just relax.
Just relax.

1127
01:19:47,451 --> 01:19:52,524
And I will give you one million
reasons to kill this guy.

1128
01:19:55,928 --> 01:19:58,164
Really?
One million?

1129
01:20:01,232 --> 01:20:02,400
It's not enough.

1130
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:08,939
- What about two million?
- You fucking pig, Mitch!

1131
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:11,240
<i>Oh, come on,
it's for a good cause.</i>

1132
01:20:11,242 --> 01:20:13,944
<i>Think of someone other
than yourself for once.</i>

1133
01:20:13,946 --> 01:20:16,249
Just wire the money, shithead,
and you have a deal.

1134
01:20:21,687 --> 01:20:23,986
- Did they double it to two million?
- They did!

1135
01:20:23,988 --> 01:20:25,088
- Great!
- Yeah.

1136
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:26,522
- Great.
- Yeah!

1137
01:20:31,228 --> 01:20:33,062
- You are very good at that.
- Yeah.

1138
01:20:33,064 --> 01:20:35,131
What do you say we, uh,
hit the town to celebrate?

1139
01:20:35,133 --> 01:20:37,266
- Yes! Yes, we need to celebrate. Fiesta!
- Huh? Yeah?

1140
01:20:37,268 --> 01:20:38,467
Fiesta!

1141
01:20:47,245 --> 01:20:50,012
- Come on, dance.
- No, I'm good. I don't dance.

1142
01:20:50,014 --> 01:20:53,285
- Come on!
- No, Harold, I won't. No, Harold.

1143
01:20:54,185 --> 01:20:56,022
No. Harold.

1144
01:20:57,755 --> 01:21:00,390
I don't... I don't...
I don't... I don't dance.

1145
01:21:00,392 --> 01:21:02,691
- Come on!
- Okay.

1146
01:21:02,693 --> 01:21:04,129
Okay. All right.

1147
01:21:06,398 --> 01:21:09,335
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1148
01:21:34,658 --> 01:21:36,062
Look.

1149
01:21:56,782 --> 01:21:58,517
I'm here to see Mr. Vega.

1150
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:08,393
Hey, gringo, you're late.

1151
01:22:12,496 --> 01:22:15,097
Oh, fuck,
that was too good.

1152
01:22:15,099 --> 01:22:17,534
Oh.
Oh, man.

1153
01:22:17,536 --> 01:22:21,303
You know, I really feel like
things are turning around for me.

1154
01:22:21,305 --> 01:22:22,739
Yeah?

1155
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:24,577
Thank you, Mitch.

1156
01:22:26,111 --> 01:22:27,177
Thank you.

1157
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:28,381
Sure.

1158
01:22:32,716 --> 01:22:35,420
All right. Harold, there's
something I have to tell you.

1159
01:22:36,455 --> 01:22:37,723
Uh...

1160
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:42,560
Richard's my brother.

1161
01:22:44,463 --> 01:22:45,563
Yeah.

1162
01:22:47,732 --> 01:22:50,132
Richard Rusk?

1163
01:22:50,134 --> 01:22:52,704
Yep, unfortunately.

1164
01:22:59,176 --> 01:23:01,177
- Fuck!
- Ah.

1165
01:23:01,179 --> 01:23:03,680
Can't fucking do it.

1166
01:23:03,682 --> 01:23:05,815
Why... Why have you got that out?
What are you doing?

1167
01:23:05,817 --> 01:23:11,120
It seems Richard's company wants to
claim the insurance policy money.

1168
01:23:11,122 --> 01:23:14,190
No, no. No, no, no. Richard
said they have canceled it.

1169
01:23:14,192 --> 01:23:17,894
- They have canceled the policy.
- No, your life insurance policy, Harold.

1170
01:23:17,896 --> 01:23:20,497
So...

1171
01:23:20,499 --> 01:23:22,765
- But I thought you liked me.
- I do like you.

1172
01:23:22,767 --> 01:23:25,834
No, no, no. But you-you-you said
you liked my whole underdog thing.

1173
01:23:25,836 --> 01:23:28,370
- I love your underdog thing.
- So, Mitch, please.

1174
01:23:28,372 --> 01:23:33,275
Look, I made a deal with Richard that
if I sacrificed you, I can help...

1175
01:23:33,277 --> 01:23:35,345
Sacrifice...
You want to sacrifice...

1176
01:23:35,347 --> 01:23:38,147
- ...thousands... hundreds of thousands of underdogs.
- You want to sacrifice me. Hey!

1177
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:40,150
You understand? Harold.

1178
01:23:40,152 --> 01:23:42,552
Oh, Lord Almighty!

1179
01:23:42,554 --> 01:23:44,253
Shh.

1180
01:23:44,255 --> 01:23:45,888
Harold. Shit.

1181
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:48,391
Please, God,
save me from this man.

1182
01:23:48,393 --> 01:23:53,363
Please, I beg you. Help me in my
moment of need. Please, Jesus. Please.

1183
01:23:53,365 --> 01:23:55,233
Harold, nobody's coming
in your moment of need.

1184
01:23:56,867 --> 01:23:58,834
You really believe in God?

1185
01:23:58,836 --> 01:24:02,172
Of course I believe in God. What kind
of person does not believe in God?

1186
01:24:02,174 --> 01:24:04,510
Me. I... I don't.

1187
01:24:07,812 --> 01:24:10,879
Well, I mean, I...
I guess I kind of do,

1188
01:24:10,881 --> 01:24:14,650
but not... not in a life-or-death
situation, Harold.

1189
01:24:14,652 --> 01:24:17,854
You know, I... I'm looking for
something, but something more...

1190
01:24:17,856 --> 01:24:21,857
more reliable, you know?

1191
01:24:21,859 --> 01:24:26,262
Yeah, I mean, sure, I tried reading
the Bible a couple of times, but...

1192
01:24:26,264 --> 01:24:29,332
I mean, the Old Testament, Harold.
You can't take that shit seriously.

1193
01:24:29,334 --> 01:24:32,202
And the New Testament, I mean...

1194
01:24:32,204 --> 01:24:35,771
- You take the Bible seriously?
- Of course.

1195
01:24:35,773 --> 01:24:39,208
Really? Like the whole thing
with Peter and Judas.

1196
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:43,846
Remember? So-So Peter
denies Jesus three times.

1197
01:24:43,848 --> 01:24:45,847
Three fucking times, man.

1198
01:24:45,849 --> 01:24:50,285
Now, Judas, on the other hand,
yeah, I mean, he fucked up.

1199
01:24:50,287 --> 01:24:55,357
He sold Jesus out, all right?
But he felt bad about it.

1200
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:58,828
He hung himself, man!
He felt guilty!

1201
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:03,732
He had a lot more fucking
character than fucking Peter.

1202
01:25:03,734 --> 01:25:06,369
I mean, Peter.

1203
01:25:06,371 --> 01:25:09,571
How do you get behind a religion
that demonizes a guy like Judas

1204
01:25:09,573 --> 01:25:12,310
and makes a saint
out of a guy like Peter?

1205
01:25:14,646 --> 01:25:15,747
Well...

1206
01:25:17,381 --> 01:25:20,318
one was a man
who had a crisis of faith.

1207
01:25:21,652 --> 01:25:24,486
The other one sold his soul
for his own gain.

1208
01:25:24,488 --> 01:25:27,623
So you have to ask yourself,
which one are you?

1209
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:29,558
Well...

1210
01:25:36,901 --> 01:25:38,370
Put it on!

1211
01:26:18,742 --> 01:26:21,546
Ah.

1212
01:26:45,469 --> 01:26:46,968
Okay.

1213
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:48,473
Here.

1214
01:26:52,009 --> 01:26:53,810
Nelly said it'd be easy.

1215
01:26:53,812 --> 01:26:57,012
It is. Getting
out of here isn't.

1216
01:26:57,014 --> 01:26:59,584
There's one exit
and security checks everything.

1217
01:27:04,522 --> 01:27:07,489
Mate. Mate! How the fuck am I
supposed to get out of here?

1218
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:10,428
It's okay. I have a little plan.
Come on.

1219
01:27:12,063 --> 01:27:14,433
Nelly, you fucking bitch.

1220
01:27:28,112 --> 01:27:29,314
<i>Alto.</i>

1221
01:27:44,763 --> 01:27:46,532
Ah.

1222
01:28:58,102 --> 01:29:00,602
Come on.

1223
01:29:00,604 --> 01:29:03,442
Let's take the sad song
and make it better.

1224
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,429
Hey.

1225
01:29:32,202 --> 01:29:34,572
Oh.

1226
01:29:44,081 --> 01:29:45,450
Hello, Harold.

1227
01:30:10,674 --> 01:30:12,674
Put this on.

1228
01:30:12,676 --> 01:30:16,014
When you get outside, you go to
your car and don't look back.

1229
01:30:22,987 --> 01:30:24,223
Follow me.

1230
01:30:24,923 --> 01:30:25,923
Let's go.

1231
01:30:44,741 --> 01:30:47,044
Okay, this way.

1232
01:30:59,223 --> 01:31:01,225
Sunny said you were fucking DEA.

1233
01:32:04,755 --> 01:32:06,991
The-The-The gates!
The gates!

1234
01:32:16,067 --> 01:32:17,803
Where are you?

1235
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:24,673
What the fuck?

1236
01:32:24,675 --> 01:32:27,810
Angel!
What the motherfuck?

1237
01:32:27,812 --> 01:32:31,213
Harold, I need you to be very calm
right now. You understand me?

1238
01:32:31,215 --> 01:32:34,917
My name is not Angel. I'm Victor Cruz.
I'm with the DEA.

1239
01:32:34,919 --> 01:32:39,454
I infiltrated Villegas, and then your buddy
Sanchez showed up, so I infiltrated Promethium.

1240
01:32:39,456 --> 01:32:41,660
You know, you work
for bad people, Harold.

1241
01:32:42,727 --> 01:32:44,325
You speak English?

1242
01:32:44,327 --> 01:32:47,832
Yes, I speak English!
Fuck!

1243
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,175
Go, go, go, go!

1244
01:33:06,483 --> 01:33:07,852
Aah!

1245
01:33:09,887 --> 01:33:11,167
What is wrong with these people?

1246
01:33:15,759 --> 01:33:17,839
On the side! On the side!
He's coming up on the side!

1247
01:33:24,736 --> 01:33:26,805
I don't think
he can survive that.

1248
01:34:00,271 --> 01:34:01,706
Ohh!

1249
01:34:58,228 --> 01:34:59,497
Hey!

1250
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,234
Harold!

1251
01:35:05,236 --> 01:35:07,205
You okay, buddy?

1252
01:36:05,095 --> 01:36:06,497
Are you okay?

1253
01:36:07,999 --> 01:36:09,867
You saved my life,
Harold.

1254
01:36:15,606 --> 01:36:17,541
I need your help.

1255
01:36:19,542 --> 01:36:21,443
I can't go back home.

1256
01:36:21,445 --> 01:36:26,181
There's nothing
for me there. Nothing.

1257
01:36:26,183 --> 01:36:28,217
Please.

1258
01:36:28,219 --> 01:36:30,084
Please.

1259
01:36:30,086 --> 01:36:33,591
You know, people disappear
all the time, Harold.

1260
01:36:35,425 --> 01:36:37,262
You died here tonight.

1261
01:36:38,963 --> 01:36:40,866
You understand me?

1262
01:36:42,099 --> 01:36:43,501
I understand.

1263
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:59,017
This has everything you'll need
to bring down Richard Rusk.

1264
01:37:13,363 --> 01:37:14,432
Aah.

1265
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:20,104
Have a great life, Harold.

1266
01:39:06,777 --> 01:39:08,680
Babe.

1267
01:39:11,081 --> 01:39:12,748
What the fuck?

1268
01:40:10,841 --> 01:40:13,909
It's a tough situation, but these were very
dangerous people you were dealing with.

1269
01:40:13,911 --> 01:40:16,244
And I was so scared.

1270
01:40:19,517 --> 01:40:21,682
You did the right thing
here today.

1271
01:40:32,696 --> 01:40:34,463
Go!

1272
01:40:37,667 --> 01:40:41,936
Richard Rusk?

1273
01:40:41,938 --> 01:40:44,205
- Yeah.
- I have a warrant for your arrest.

1274
01:40:44,207 --> 01:40:47,476
Give him the ball.

1275
01:41:13,536 --> 01:41:16,605
<i>After an intense six-month trial</i>

1276

Markinson turn state's evidence against him,</i>

Harold, would still be alive.</i>
