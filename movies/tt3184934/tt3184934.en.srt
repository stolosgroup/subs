A NEW FRIEND

3
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:05,417
Laura was my best friend,
my friend forever.

4
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,119
Since we met
it was like a crush.

5
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,821
Because she was and I was.

6
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:17,823
We had seven years ...

7
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:21,924
and it sure would be for
life to death.

8
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,835
I present to your
new partner,

9
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,136
Laura.

10
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:40,339
Well, we were in
the grammar lesson,

11
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,940
with verbs of the first group.

12
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:46,241
Who can give me examples
verbs of the first group?

13
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,884
All life to death.

14
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,685
All life to death.

15
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:36,286
All life to death.

16
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,029
All they look.

17
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,536
Hi Laura.
Are you okay?

18
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,770
What's up?

19
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:10,136
May the Lord confirm
this decision ...

20
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:15,537
and give them his Spirit to
I serve as a common agreement,

21
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:21,338
and that your union be blessed
in the name of the Father and of the Son ...

22
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,539
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

23
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:27,041
United by the bonds
marriage

24
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:30,542
with from now on,
as a guarantee of your alliance,

25
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:31,943
these rings.

26
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,260
In the name of the Father ...

27
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,661
and of the Son ...

28
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,262
and the Holy Spirit.

29
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,208
Laura ...

30
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:29,556
And as in our childhood ...

31
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:32,558
We made a pact.

32
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,160
I made a promise.

33
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:40,561
This promise, Laura,
I'll keep it for you.

34
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:43,863
I will be all my life ...

35
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:47,465
ensuring your daughter Lucie ...

36
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,467
and his father, David.

37
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:34,508
For the Father, his son
and the Holy Spirit.

38
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,736
It's time, Claire.
Come on, get up.

39
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,442
I do not want to go.

40
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,543
Yes, make an effort.

41
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:16,544
You work, you
think of something else.

42
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:19,845
You agree?
See you tonight.

43
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:23,948
Until tonight.

44
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Sorry.

45
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,932
It is done!

46
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,334
Bravo.

47
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:00,342
Do not you feel good?

48
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:03,543
Yes, but I wanted to tell you ...

49
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:07,045
I took a week's leave.

50
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:09,247
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

51
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:11,948
I can not work,
not concentrate.

52
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,049
Do not apologize dear,
I understand you.

53
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,252
You called David?

54
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:20,054
No.

55
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,555
You could take this
week to go see him.

56
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:24,556
Help you with your daughter.

57
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:27,357
I'm afraid of ...

58
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,859
to see Lucie.

59
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,060
It reminds both Laura.

60
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:51,577
Thanks for dinner.

61
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:53,578
Barely touched your plate.

62
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,379
- It was very good.
- Thank You.

63
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,499
- Do you want to do it?
- But yes.

64
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:21,501
- Are you sure?
- Sure, why ask?

65
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,814
<I> Hi, is David,
I'm away, but ... </ i>

66
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:56,793
Is there someone?

67
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,515
Good morning lady I ...

68
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:31,325
Sorry, just passing by,
I do not want to bother.

69
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:32,926
Wait, Claire ...

70
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:36,929
Stay, I must explain.

71
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,330
There is nothing to explain,
You do what you want.

72
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:40,831
Please, you must listen.

73
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:44,233
I'm going to bed the girl
and I'll be back.

74
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:46,534
Sit, drink something,
I'll be right back.

75
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:06,854
PARENTS

76
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:08,355
NEWSPAPER OF THE HOUSE

77
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:09,857
101 recipes to delight

78
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:14,261
And I went to bed.

79
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:17,563
I'm going to have a drink.

80
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,579
First of all,
I want you to know ...

81
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,380
Laura knew.

82
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:39,082
- Oh yeah?
- Yes

83
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:42,483
I know you had everything,
but this kept secret.

84
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:52,692
Before we got married ...

85
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:54,793
I confessed that ...

86
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,495
sometimes I liked
dressed as a woman.

87
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:02,296
Only that, as a game.
For pleasure.

88
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:04,698
He accepted it very well.

89
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,200
All he asked me ...

90
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,601
It was not to do it in public.

91
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:12,902
Then now
she's dead ...

92
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:14,803
Claire ...

93
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:19,005
I never left this house
dressed as a woman.

94
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,206
Nobody saw me as well.

95
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,208
Unless you today.

96
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,709
It was an accident.

97
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:37,118
In all this time
with Laura ...

98
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,419
He did not feel the need.

99
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:45,022
Her presence, her femininity,
I sated.

100
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:47,924
He loved her so much.

101
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:51,926
It was after his death
he returned ...

102
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:54,728
as evidence.

103
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,433
<I> started a week later
Laura's funeral. </ i>

104
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:05,335
<I> was alone with Lucie
in my room ... </ i>

105
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,536
<I> trying to give him his bottle ... </ i>

106
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,937
<I> but I would not stop screaming. </ I>

107
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:12,838
<I> For two days
barely fed. </ i>

108
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:19,643
<I> In that moment I understood
I missed Laura. </ i>

109
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:21,144
<I> How I missed her. </ I>

110
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:23,145
This shirt is from Mom.

111
00:18:29,552 --> 00:18:31,052
<I> And suddenly ... </ i>

112
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,353
<I> the pain of his absence ... </ i>

113
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,654
<I> his fault, disappeared. </ I>

114
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,457
<I> The scent of Laura ... </ i>

115
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:41,258
<I> his clothes ... </ i>

116
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,459
<I> a feeling of fullness
I was overwhelmed ... </ i>

117
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,060
<I> like I was there. </ I>

118
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:48,861
<I> She spoke to me ... </ i>

119
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,162
Lucie.

120
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,363
<I> was inside me. </ I>

121
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:56,967
Wait.

122
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:38,706
Being alone with a child
to raise is very hard.

123
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:41,708
I think that ...

124
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:44,309
I could give you a
maternal presence.

125
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:47,411
Every child needs a mother.

126
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,512
And a father.

127
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:52,514
I do both.

128
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,621
It is temporal.

129
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:02,622
Only a less brutal form
leaving Laura.

130
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:04,823
To get used to his absence.

131
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:06,924
You do not do for Lucie.

132
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:10,827
It's for your own pleasure.

133
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:15,431
you are a pervert.

134
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:22,838
Maybe you're right.

135
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:26,942
Please, Claire.

136
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:29,483
Do not tell anyone, not to Gilles.
Just between us.

137
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:30,544
I do not know ...

138
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:34,145
If Laura's parents find out,
I care Lucie removed.

139
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,346
- You know how much I love her.
- Yes, I know ...

140
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:41,548
I want you to understand
as always he understood me Laura.

141
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,850
No goals Laura in all this!

142
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:13,776
Transvestite

143
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,681
Crossdressing. As become
more feminine!

144
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,290
- Goodnight My Love.
- Are you okay?

145
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:32,992
You smell nice!

146
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,794
Y? What did you do today?

147
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,695
- Nothing special.
- Do not you get out?

148
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:39,896
Yes ...

149
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:42,297
- To a friend.
- Yes? Who?

150
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:45,098
You do not know her,
a fellow high school.

151
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:48,399
- Did you know Laura?
- Yes, a little.

152
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,500
What you how did it go?

153
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:52,801
There was more.

154
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:55,602
- Not to get orders.
- Best.

155
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,407
- I did not tell you.
- What?

156
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,208
I called David.

157
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:06,409
- David ...
- As there beckoned, I did.

158
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,110
I suggested going to dinner
together on Saturday.

159
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:12,011
So we distendemos a little.

160
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,113
What did he say?

161
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:19,314
Which in principle would be fine,
You should only get a babysitter.

162
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:25,618
He told me that since the death
Laura he never left.

163
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:30,621
- When did you call?
- A while ago.

164
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:36,425
It is for you.
You do not answer?

165
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:38,026
Yes.

166
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:48,836
<I> Good morning, Claire.
How are you? </ I>

167
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:50,917
Why are you calling from
that phone? You are crazy?

168
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:53,638
<I> Sorry, I wanted to be
sure answer. </ i>

169
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,039
What's up?
Why do you call me?

170
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,840
<I> I need to see you. </ I>

171
00:22:58,141 --> 00:23:01,441
<I> It did me good to talk to you
and that you share with me. </ i>

172
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:02,842
I go, dear.

173
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:05,043
- We turn to speak.
- I beg you, Claire.

174
00:23:05,044 --> 00:23:06,544
Then I'll see.

175
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:08,045
Who is it?

176
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:10,246
That childhood friend of
I told you, it's heavy.

177
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,547
- Do not sit well ...
- What happens?

178
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:15,648
- Having trouble with her husband.
- What's it called?

179
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,450
Virginia.

180
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:20,551
Well, see you at night.

181
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:22,052
Until tonight.
Good job.

182
00:23:22,053 --> 00:23:23,053
Thank You.

183
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,510
Who is it?

184
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:22,311
Me, Claire.

185
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:25,314
Enters.

186
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,619
Thanks for coming.

187
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,720
- Did you get the scent of Laura?
- Yes.

188
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:38,622
- That dress was Laura?
- Sure, the I retouched.

189
00:24:39,624 --> 00:24:40,924
You like it?

190
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:44,025
Is to show me that dress
I did come?

191
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:45,626
Yes, among other things.

192
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:50,229
I think it's time
of the bottle.

193
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,130
Make yourself comfortable,
I will look to Lucie.

194
00:24:56,535 --> 00:24:59,235
I love your lipstick.
It fits you well.

195
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:01,036
Thank You.

196
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:02,637
I'm coming, Lucie.

197
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:19,253
Yes my love.

198
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:21,655
But yes ...

199
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:26,057
Look Who's here.
Your godmother, Claire.

200
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,058
Smile at.

201
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,760
It's amazing how
Laura looks like.

202
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:34,061
The same eyes.

203
00:25:34,562 --> 00:25:36,062
- And the mouth.
- Take it.

204
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:39,763
I'll get her bottle.
It's nothing, it's nothing ...

205
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:42,064
Mom turns away.

206
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:45,565
- What happens to you?
- It's ridiculous.

207
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:54,071
This can not last forever.
it's crazy.

208
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:56,772
I know, but found
Nothing better.

209
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,975
- And your work?
- Paternity leave.

210
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:04,576
Laura's father told me
I take my time.

211
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:07,677
Why not take someone?
A full-time nanny.

212
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:09,678
Lucie would have a
female presence and ...

213
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,979
No, Laura promised care
it myself.

214
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,580
I also.

215
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:16,381
And watch over you.

216
00:26:16,582 --> 00:26:18,682
It's what you're doing today.

217
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:22,484
Do you think you told him to Fuiste
Gilles to call me?

218
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:25,685
- Did you tell him?
- Of course not.

219
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:31,288
I have a lot of sewing to do
and I ordered dresses online.

220
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:34,189
My dream would be to go
boutiques women,

221
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,190
do shopping and
buy large sizes.

222
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,591
But I never dared.

223
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:44,594
Laura had tons of clothes.
You can take whatever you want.

224
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:47,695
- Will not you stay with anything?
- Yes, but kids sizes.

225
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:48,996
I gain nothing.

226
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:51,397
- Are not you going to put this?
- I would love to.

227
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:54,298
But in here
it's a little hot.

228
00:26:58,102 --> 00:27:02,002
You should touch the shoulders.
But I look good, right?

229
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,403
Yes, rather.

230
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:06,304
I personally am
against the skin.

231
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:09,205
It's an old animal.
It was my mother.

232
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:13,008
Did you keep a coat
of your mother?

233
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:15,209
If, as I recall.
I loved my mother.

234
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,110
This dress also.

235
00:27:17,711 --> 00:27:20,111
- Is it because of it?
- Because of it, what?

236
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:23,412
- That you dress as a woman.
- No, I think not.

237
00:27:23,713 --> 00:27:27,313
As a child I loved to dress up.
Especially not with her clothes.

238
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,814
Yes ... with your clothes
sometimes inside.

239
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:34,416
He would have liked
having a girl.

240
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:37,117
No, I was delighted
of having a boy.

241
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:39,018
My father too.

242
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:49,327
- Shit!
- Who is it?

243
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:51,028
My mother in law.

244
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,435
- Claire!
- Good morning, Liz.

245
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:02,737
- What a nice surprise!
- Yes.

246
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,538
I came to take care
a little Lucie.

247
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,639
How good of you
come to lend a hand.

248
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,440
- I brought a gift to Lucie.
- How nice.

249
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:11,582
I will give later,
It is napping.

250
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,442
- David is best?
- Yes.

251
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,343
- Are you resting?
- No, you're showering.

252
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:18,744
A shower at this hour?

253
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:20,745
Yes, I believe. It will not delay.

254
00:28:21,947 --> 00:28:24,347
I'm not sure
I have made.

255
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,150
You're fine?

256
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:30,652
it's difficult.

257
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:33,053
You should come to the parish.

258
00:28:33,154 --> 00:28:36,454
I'm sure you would
While talking, praying.

259
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:38,956
It helps me a lot.

260
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,059
Maybe.

261
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:46,762
What a beautiful couple did!

262
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:53,065
With Robert, we decided to let
the house and Laura savings

263
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,466
so you can raise the child
in good conditions.

264
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,467
it's okay.

265
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,068
No money and their parents
They did not have much.

266
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:05,172
- David!
- Good morning, Liz. Sorry.

267
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:06,273
- How are you?
- Yes ...

268
00:29:06,274 --> 00:29:08,374
I'm so glad to see them.

269
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:10,175
- They are fine?
- Yes.

270
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:11,276
The lipstick.

271
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,879
What happens?

272
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,580
- David! What happens?
- Excuse me.

273
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:19,781
What happens?

274
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:21,682
You must have eaten
anything wrong.

275
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,783
The poor is not good!

276
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:32,992
Sorry.

277
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:34,493
Take a good hot tea.

278
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:36,694
No, I think I need
something stronger.

279
00:29:36,995 --> 00:29:39,095
How is Lucie?

280
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:43,696
It is fine, thanks to Claire
that helps me a lot.

281
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:47,197
Laura always knew he could
trust your best friend.

282
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:48,398
Thank You.

283
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:03,312
Well ... I'm going, I have
to do some shopping.

284
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:06,113
- Already?
- I have to have lunch with Gilles.

285
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:08,314
Goodbye dear.

286
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,315
Give a kiss
your lovely husband.

287
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:11,316
Agree.

288
00:30:12,418 --> 00:30:13,618
I'll walk.

289
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:18,623
Thanks, Claire.

290
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,225
- I forgot to tell you something.
- What?

291
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:27,127
Do not call me again with the
Phone Laura, removed it.

292
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:48,347
- Did you get a dress?
- You do not like?

293
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:50,348
Yes, but while ...

294
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,649
I try as we left.

295
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:56,552
- What?
- Looks Good.

296
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:58,153
- What?
- Wait.

297
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:00,355
What are you doing?

298
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,860
You like it?

299
00:31:06,261 --> 00:31:07,761
I look like an old whore.

300
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:10,463
No, you exalted.

301
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:13,165
Did you get a nanny?

302
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:15,766
Better yet, let Lucie
with my inlaws.

303
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,667
For one week.

304
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:20,869
He will do well to take
a little time for me.

305
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,970
It is exactly what
I tell Claire.

306
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:26,172
- Time is very important.
- But I'm scared.

307
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:27,573
Why?

308
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:31,275
Care of Lucie
not let me think a lot,

309
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:33,276
but I'll be alone ...

310
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:35,377
single without Laura.

311
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,678
What you achieve, you'll see.

312
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,779
We will support.
Claire Is not it true?

313
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,380
Yes, of course.

314
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:45,281
- Have they chosen?
- Yes, I want the menu.

315
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:47,882
- How do you want the beef?
- On the brink.

316
00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:50,483
- I do the same, but juicy.
- Very good.

317
00:31:50,984 --> 00:31:51,984
And you, dear?

318
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:54,085
I want the bass, please.

319
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:56,886
I wanted the same thing,
instead of meat.

320
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:01,188
Will you continue with the same wine?
- Yes, it is perfect.

321
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:02,389
Thank You.

322
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,091
Thank You.

323
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:07,193
Lovely is not it?

324
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:11,797
What? Is not it pretty?

325
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,398
- For, Gilles!
- What's up?

326
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,699
It has a nice dress,
It is true.

327
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:21,303
- Sorry?
- Yes?

328
00:32:21,804 --> 00:32:24,204
- Services, please?
- Going down to the right.

329
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:26,205
I will later.

330
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,408
- When did you start working?
- Tuesday.

331
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,210
We can meet
Monday, then.

332
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:37,812
It does not think it's a good idea.

333
00:32:38,013 --> 00:32:39,013
Please.

334
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:41,614
I want you to come with me
to do shopping.

335
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:43,716
Will you go to Virginia?

336
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,319
- How to Virginia?
- I mean ... as a woman.

337
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:51,521
It would be nice as Virginia.

338
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:53,322
Now comes, shut up.

339
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:56,823
Come with your car at 14 pm.
I'll open the garage.

340
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,230
I love him to David,
He's a good guy.

341
00:33:05,431 --> 00:33:06,431
No?

342
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:10,234
- What's up?
- Nothing.

343
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:13,735
- Yes, I see ...
- You were odious to the waitress.

344
00:33:14,236 --> 00:33:15,236
What?

345
00:33:15,237 --> 00:33:17,337
David comes from losing his wife
and incite to flirt.

346
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:20,338
I just wanted to defuse the atmosphere.
He did not take it badly.

347
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,340
Anyway ...
He saw that he was not interested.

348
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:27,742
I always thought
I was a little ...

349
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:31,745
A little what?

350
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:33,346
He has something. is very ...

351
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:36,147
- Female. it feels ...
- Oh, good.

352
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:40,048
Yes. I'm sure Laura
and he wanted but ...

353
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:42,749
I have the impression that
men are like him.

354
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:20,386
- Did you finish?
- No ...

355
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:22,688
No, but never mind.

356
00:34:58,424 --> 00:34:59,924
Dave, are you here?

357
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:01,926
I'm coming.

358
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:09,633
Hi ...

359
00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:29,052
Do you think go well?

360
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:30,853
Why?
Not well?

361
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:33,354
Try out with you,
but discreetly.

362
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:37,255
I do not want to look at me walking
1m with a transvestite, 80.

363
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:41,859
Then what do we do?

364
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:45,761
Why do not you wear pants?

365
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:48,562
No, for the first exit
I want to show my legs.

366
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:52,164
- Where is the dress the other day?
- Which?

367
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:54,365
- The one retocaste.
- It's dirty.

368
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,466
- Go get it.
- It's all wrinkled.

369
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:58,367
It's not a fashion show.

370
00:35:58,468 --> 00:36:00,868
Let alone to go shopping
and not to attract attention.

371
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:01,969
Agree.

372
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:04,771
I'll board a little.

373
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,480
- Here it is.
- Very good.

374
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,882
Did I leave the middle?

375
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:20,985
I do not know ...

376
00:36:20,986 --> 00:36:23,386
- You should Otherwise, shave.
- No, let them.

377
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:24,987
I do not want to
wait two hours.

378
00:36:24,988 --> 00:36:27,688
You must help me, because
I have hairs on the back

379
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:30,089
and I can not take them off myself.

380
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:34,191
- What a mess in this dress!
- Wait.

381
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,093
- It is done.
- Thank You.

382
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,605
Beware, it was not
well lit.

383
00:36:51,707 --> 00:36:54,407
It is that I do do
anything.

384
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:56,608
We do not do anything wrong.

385
00:36:58,911 --> 00:36:59,911
Wait.

386
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:02,512
Do not you have another
more discreet wig?

387
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:04,213
I amounts.

388
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,017
It is done!

389
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:16,622
That's great!
I peinaste as Laura.

390
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:25,729
- Is not it too much?
- Do you think I can recognize?

391
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,430
Better not.

392
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:29,431
- Where we go?
- To the city.

393
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:30,632
But where?

394
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:33,133
A shopping center,
It is full of boutiques.

395
00:37:52,553 --> 00:37:53,553
Claire.

396
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:54,954
Yes?

397
00:37:54,955 --> 00:37:56,455
Does the wig okay?

398
00:37:57,256 --> 00:37:58,256
Yes Yes.

399
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:00,357
Lovely.

400
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:02,258
Come on.

401
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:06,461
Then you call me Virginia.

402
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:07,862
OK

403
00:38:09,564 --> 00:38:11,364
My first outing in shape.

404
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:15,266
Should not you also
change your voice a little bit?

405
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:23,073
- Good day.
- Good day.

406
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,880
Have the keys
Car, Virginia?

407
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:36,583
- Did you become silent?
- But no.

408
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,585
- The put in your bag.
- What a fool I am!

409
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:49,693
You're still not ready.

410
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,395
You'll see what I can do.

411
00:39:19,722 --> 00:39:22,122
- They realize?
- I think not.

412
00:39:22,924 --> 00:39:24,444
He could have let me
the other dressed.

413
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,925
But no, it's fine.
You mean you're credible.

414
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,333
It is the same color, look.

415
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,440
Smells.

416
00:39:44,242 --> 00:39:45,242
How nice!

417
00:39:57,755 --> 00:39:58,755
Look.

418
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:02,858
- Is it too dark?
- It does not look good on you.

419
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:12,267
Virginia.

420
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:15,269
You like it?

421
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:17,472
- Can I fit?
- Check it out!

422
00:40:18,073 --> 00:40:19,273
- It's going very well.
- Thank You.

423
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:23,874
- It is not my style.
- Yes, it matches your hair.

424
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:27,576
- It makes you thinner.
- It is true?

425
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:29,177
And for the price, honestly ...

426
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:31,278
Goodbye, have a nice day.

427
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:44,289
- Shall we?
- Today I do not feel ready.

428
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,690
Why?

429
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:49,191
I already told you. I do not Epilate
legs and chest.

430
00:40:49,392 --> 00:40:50,392
Yes.

431
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:52,894
It will be for next time.

432
00:40:55,797 --> 00:40:58,797
- You'd go out with me again?
- Yes, why not?

433
00:40:59,198 --> 00:41:01,598
- And Gilles?
- What about Gilles?

434
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,500
- I do not know ...
- No incumbent and ...

435
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:08,401
not understand.
We're going to start the movie!

436
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:11,903
Wait, do not run it
that I have tacos.

437
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,805
Look at this actress!

438
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,207
- Would you let me?
- Yeah right.

439
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:22,068
- Changing of place.
- Yes.

440
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:30,774
Tell me the truth.
You like men.

441
00:42:31,476 --> 00:42:32,476
But no!

442
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:34,677
Man in cinema
I was excited right?

443
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:35,778
Oh yeah!

444
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:37,879
Yes, but not as we understand.

445
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,680
I was happy I
He takes over a woman.

446
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:42,581
And you touch her.

447
00:42:43,383 --> 00:42:46,083
Claire, may seem
strange but no.

448
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:47,984
I never attracted men.

449
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:51,386
Now, women do, always.

450
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:54,687
Maybe it's because I want
be like them.

451
00:42:55,689 --> 00:42:57,789
Have you tried with a man?

452
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,190
Never.

453
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:03,791
As a teenager I masturbated
with friends in the catechism ...

454
00:43:04,192 --> 00:43:05,692
But nothing more.

455
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,793
Virginia How would you like?

456
00:43:09,395 --> 00:43:10,895
I never thought.

457
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:15,096
But this is the first time I go
as a woman, watching me ...

458
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:18,097
so you never know.
You have to try.

459
00:43:18,498 --> 00:43:20,298
Not to die idiot.

460
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,900
It's all so new to me,
thank you.

461
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:26,901
It's like a rebirth.

462
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:35,406
You should not hold my hand,
There is a guy who is watching us.

463
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:40,609
Do not worry, women
often they hold hands.

464
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:43,211
Certain types of women.

465
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:54,321
I would like this evening
it never ends.

466
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:55,522
Ten.

467
00:43:55,523 --> 00:43:58,223
- I think you were right.
- About what?

468
00:43:58,924 --> 00:44:01,324
It is not just by Lucie
I dressed as a woman.

469
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:09,131
What's up?

470
00:44:09,932 --> 00:44:11,432
I spotted.

471
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:13,634
Wait.

472
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,238
It is done.

473
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:21,239
Gilles and not suspect anything.

474
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:24,041
- Bye-Bye.
- Bye-Bye.

475
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:20,394
This is what will happen in
little or longer.

476
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:23,299
I have an urgent call.

477
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:30,204
- David?
- No, Virginia.

478
00:45:30,505 --> 00:45:32,905
<I> See you for lunch.
I'm not good at all. </ I>

479
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:34,806
Yes, but not before 13 and 30.

480
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:36,607
<I> See you at your office? </ I>

481
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:38,908
In the coffee shop across the street.

482
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:40,409
<I> Thank you Claire.
Until then. </ I>

483
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,410
Do you come dressed as?

484
00:45:42,511 --> 00:45:44,611
<I> No, I said it was Virginia. </ I>

485
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:46,812
- Sorry, it can not be.
- Why?

486
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:49,913
It is close to the office.
I can not take chances.

487
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:52,714
<I> What are the risks?
The other time was all right. </ I>

488
00:45:53,215 --> 00:45:57,415
Well, see you at 13 and 45
in the lounge of the Mall.

489
00:45:58,917 --> 00:45:59,917
There you are!

490
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:01,318
Hello.

491
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:04,219
Sorry for the delay,
I have a lot of work.

492
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,721
Do you let the glasses?

493
00:46:06,822 --> 00:46:10,122
- You asked me to be discreet.
- I think that's fine.

494
00:46:11,124 --> 00:46:13,524
I have only half an hour. I'll take
a sandwich, do you want anything?

495
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:15,125
No, I'm not hungry.

496
00:46:15,326 --> 00:46:16,526
- Insurance?
- Yes.

497
00:46:17,127 --> 00:46:19,527
Good day, one of these
sandwiches, please.

498
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:27,033
I like your skirt.
It Looks Good.

499
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:28,434
Thank You.

500
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:31,236
Do not you shaved?

501
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:36,139
- Noticeable?
- Yes, a little.

502
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,840
Shit!

503
00:46:38,942 --> 00:46:40,742
He employs a woman.

504
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:45,344
- What medication are you taking?
- Nothing ...

505
00:46:45,745 --> 00:46:47,045
antidepressants.

506
00:46:49,148 --> 00:46:53,048
You know, our access to the center
Trade was like a trigger.

507
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,249
I never felt so happy ...

508
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,950
blissful.

509
00:46:58,152 --> 00:46:59,952
We repeat that ...

510
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:02,653
I'm overwhelmed with work,
this week is difficult.

511
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,955
Claire, you can not leave me like this.
I need you.

512
00:47:09,257 --> 00:47:11,657
Laura's parents stay
with Lucie until Sunday.

513
00:47:11,758 --> 00:47:14,158
We could go to his house.

514
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:19,262
It is not impossible.
What would you say to Gilles?

515
00:47:19,663 --> 00:47:21,163
The truth.

516
00:47:34,877 --> 00:47:37,877
- All right?
- I end this mess.

517
00:47:41,481 --> 00:47:43,281
This scarf is mine.

518
00:47:44,183 --> 00:47:46,583
I found there.
My throat hurts.

519
00:47:47,985 --> 00:47:48,985
Charming.

520
00:47:52,089 --> 00:47:54,789
- I spoke on the phone with my mother.
- Oh yeah?

521
00:47:56,591 --> 00:47:59,291
- Not well.
- What happens?

522
00:48:00,893 --> 00:48:02,993
I think it's something missing.

523
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:08,296
We could go see it
weekend.

524
00:48:08,297 --> 00:48:10,997
I can not, with these
office problems.

525
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:13,798
But you can go.
You do not need me.

526
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:18,401
I wish it
we were together.

527
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:21,002
On another occasion
we'll go together.

528
00:48:22,004 --> 00:48:23,004
I promise.

529
00:48:46,928 --> 00:48:47,928
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

530
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:52,331
What come loaded
for a weekend!

531
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:54,032
Suit material.

532
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:02,839
- What did you say to Gilles?
- I was going to see my mother.

533
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,140
Would you lie often?

534
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:06,341
No.

535
00:49:07,243 --> 00:49:09,643
I know only from
you dress as a woman.

536
00:49:11,145 --> 00:49:12,945
I will never lie to Laura.

537
00:49:24,357 --> 00:49:25,357
Here I am!

538
00:49:32,465 --> 00:49:34,065
- You made quickly.
- I just changed me,

539
00:49:34,066 --> 00:49:36,466
I maquillarי in the car.
You help me?

540
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:41,469
- No one saw you?
- Yes, a truck driver.

541
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,770
He saw me out of the men's room.
You must have liked my dress.

542
00:49:49,274 --> 00:49:51,374
- You want me to teach you a trick?
- Yes, what?

543
00:49:52,175 --> 00:49:53,975
For eye makeup ...

544
00:49:54,676 --> 00:49:57,976
right eye, right hand,
left eye, left hand.

545
00:50:05,484 --> 00:50:06,684
Great!

546
00:50:07,485 --> 00:50:08,685
It works!

547
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:41,075
I remember. It was in the summer
our 16 years.

548
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:42,676
Yes, I know.

549
00:51:47,882 --> 00:51:49,982
Well ...
What room you take?

550
00:51:50,183 --> 00:51:51,183
As you like.

551
00:51:51,184 --> 00:51:53,284
I parents because
there is a beautiful wardrobe

552
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:54,785
and a large mirror.

553
00:51:54,786 --> 00:51:57,186
- I'll take Laura.
- Does your childhood?

554
00:51:57,187 --> 00:51:59,587
- Yes, it gives me pleasure.
- But the bed is small.

555
00:51:59,888 --> 00:52:01,388
It does not bother me.

556
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,800
You feel good?

557
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:15,902
Yes Yes.

558
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:21,306
At seeing these pictures,

559
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:24,408
Table, it gives me something.

560
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,311
Were moments of happiness?

561
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:30,713
Yes ...

562
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,315
That is important,

563
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:36,816
no sadness, only happiness.

564
00:52:42,122 --> 00:52:43,122
Okay,

565
00:52:43,523 --> 00:52:45,323
Are we going to walk?

566
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,140
Would you push you?

567
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:24,561
You see there?

568
00:53:24,862 --> 00:53:26,062
All up.

569
00:53:26,063 --> 00:53:29,063
We used to spend hours
making things.

570
00:53:29,064 --> 00:53:31,164
We talked and played.

571
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:46,879
I can not find it.

572
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,880
- Are you sure it's here?
- Of course.

573
00:53:53,985 --> 00:53:55,185
Here, look!

574
00:53:58,289 --> 00:53:59,789
It was not erased.

575
00:54:00,591 --> 00:54:01,891
its beautiful.

576
00:55:02,752 --> 00:55:05,152
I remember what you told us
when we were kids:

577
00:55:05,453 --> 00:55:09,653
"The boys are born in a cabbage
and girls in a flower "

578
00:55:12,256 --> 00:55:13,456
I ...

579
00:55:13,957 --> 00:55:16,057
I was born in a cauliflower.

580
00:55:43,685 --> 00:55:46,085
- What happens to you?
- Sorry, I did not recognize you.

581
00:55:46,486 --> 00:55:49,486
I switched to fetch firewood.
It is more practical as a man.

582
00:55:49,487 --> 00:55:50,787
Yes, of course.

583
00:55:57,795 --> 00:56:00,795
This evening, you prefer to dine
with David or Virginia?

584
00:56:02,397 --> 00:56:04,497
Whatever, I do not care.

585
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,600
Gilles, better than
either with Virginia.

586
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:02,354
Yes?

587
00:57:06,859 --> 00:57:09,259
- I have a problem.
- Which?

588
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,660
You know.

589
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:12,461
Not much, it's worth?

590
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,062
You promised me.

591
00:57:16,465 --> 00:57:17,465
Agree.

592
00:57:28,877 --> 00:57:30,377
Is it too hot?

593
00:57:30,378 --> 00:57:33,378
Yes, but the pores
They should expand.

594
00:57:36,181 --> 00:57:40,081
- How much time is left?
- I do not know, 10 seconds.

595
00:57:40,382 --> 00:57:42,982
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...

596
00:57:43,483 --> 00:57:46,783
- 4. 5 ...
- Come on, pluck it out!

597
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:53,890
Are you okay?

598
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:56,592
You have to suffer to be beautiful.

599
00:57:57,193 --> 00:57:58,393
Show me!

600
00:58:02,598 --> 00:58:04,998
We should have done
some shopping.

601
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,699
No, it's delicious.

602
00:58:10,803 --> 00:58:12,603
I feel good here.

603
00:58:13,605 --> 00:58:16,305
I always dreamed of living
close to nature.

604
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:19,306
Have a calm life,
less stressful.

605
00:58:20,308 --> 00:58:22,108
I should go away ...

606
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:24,109
I do not know where ...

607
00:58:25,311 --> 00:58:27,711
and where it can restart
a new life ...

608
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,214
as a woman.

609
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:35,718
What is a woman's life?

610
00:58:39,522 --> 00:58:41,022
A life ...

611
00:58:42,724 --> 00:58:46,624
where you can do everything
I was forbidden to do as a man.

612
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:52,429
Did you think really?

613
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,130
Yes.

614
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,234
With Lucie, you know
it is impossible.

615
00:59:01,837 --> 00:59:03,937
Yes, I know it's complicated.

616
00:59:04,939 --> 00:59:07,939
But while there is love,
everything is possible.

617
00:59:10,042 --> 00:59:11,242
You're dreaming.

618
00:59:12,544 --> 00:59:15,544
it is only a game. You should stop
and return to reality.

619
00:59:19,148 --> 00:59:21,848
But you also,
you like to play with me.

620
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,250
Before we were not very close,

621
00:59:25,951 --> 00:59:27,751
but Virginia approached us.

622
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:30,954
No.

623
00:59:32,556 --> 00:59:34,956
It was the death of Laura
that approached us.

624
00:59:42,564 --> 00:59:44,364
So our
dear Laura.

625
00:59:47,368 --> 00:59:48,368
By Laura.

626
01:00:35,015 --> 01:00:39,215
Good evening ladies,
ladies and gentlemen!

627
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:44,216
As an exclusivity
Amazone, I present

628
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:45,817
divine ...

629
01:00:46,418 --> 01:00:47,918
the mischievous ...

630
01:00:47,919 --> 01:00:49,419
Wicked ...

631
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,320
Eva Carlton!

632
01:01:01,431 --> 01:01:05,331
<I> I used to relate
something strange men, </ i>

633
01:01:06,633 --> 01:01:10,533
<I> as light as the
ash their cigarettes. </ i>

634
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:15,735
<I> evenings in Daban
Palace of Versailles. </ I>

635
01:01:16,636 --> 01:01:20,236
<I> They were just straw castles </ i>

636
01:01:21,638 --> 01:01:25,838
<I> and wasting my time
gold in the desert. </ i>

637
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:29,939
<I> She was alone when I met you. </ I>

638
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:33,441
<I> The others were buried ... </ i>

639
01:01:33,442 --> 01:01:35,842
<I> you were alive. </ I>

640
01:01:36,343 --> 01:01:40,243
<I> sings sang as a child. </ I>

641
01:01:41,645 --> 01:01:46,845
<I> You were happy as an Italian
when he knows that will </ i>

642
01:01:47,346 --> 01:01:50,646
<I> love and wine. </ I>

643
01:01:51,447 --> 01:01:53,547
<I> And for the first time </ i>

644
01:01:53,848 --> 01:01:57,748
<I> finally felt ... </ i>

645
01:01:58,249 --> 01:02:02,449
<I> woman ... </ i>

646
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:06,650
<I> woman ... </ i>

647
01:02:07,952 --> 01:02:12,152
<I> a woman </ i>

648
01:02:12,453 --> 01:02:16,053
<I> you. </ I>

649
01:02:18,056 --> 01:02:22,256
<I> You had the air of a little old </ i>

650
01:02:22,557 --> 01:02:26,457
<I> where galloping
white horses. </ i>

651
01:02:27,459 --> 01:02:31,359
<I> Your face was serious
and clear your smile. </ i>

652
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:36,160
<I> I walked right
to your glow. </ i>

653
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:42,461
<I> Today, no matter what we do,
we love close to you </ i>

654
01:02:42,662 --> 01:02:45,662
<I> time seems so short. </ I>

655
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:50,663
<I> Because you're a man
and you are tender </ i>

656
01:02:50,964 --> 01:02:55,164
<I> and you can do beautiful
our lives </ i>

657
01:02:55,565 --> 01:03:00,365
<I> you happy as an Italian
when you know </ i>

658
01:03:00,366 --> 01:03:04,266
<I> you will love and wine. </ I>

659
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:06,367
<I> It's always like the first time </ i>

660
01:03:06,368 --> 01:03:11,768
<I> when he finally did me ... </ i>

661
01:03:11,769 --> 01:03:16,570
<I> woman ... </ i>

662
01:03:17,072 --> 01:03:20,972
<I> a woman with you. </ I>

663
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:23,573
<I> A woman ... </ i>

664
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:28,875
<I> you. </ I>

665
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:33,177
<I> Women ... </ i>

666
01:03:34,179 --> 01:03:38,579
<I> O woman ...! </ I>

667
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,280
<I> A woman ... </ i>

668
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:47,181
<I> you ... </ i>

669
01:05:01,156 --> 01:05:02,256
Are you okay?

670
01:05:02,657 --> 01:05:03,657
Yes.

671
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,359
Are you tired?

672
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,760
No.

673
01:05:10,063 --> 01:05:12,163
There's something I did not tell.

674
01:05:12,864 --> 01:05:13,864
What?

675
01:05:15,466 --> 01:05:17,266
When Laura died ...

676
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:20,067
at the funeral I was asked ...

677
01:05:20,268 --> 01:05:23,268
what clothes I wanted
it was buried.

678
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:27,570
I proposed to
her wedding dress.

679
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:30,671
And I asked them out
I who dressed.

680
01:05:31,973 --> 01:05:34,073
<I> are usually
them to do, </ i>

681
01:05:34,574 --> 01:05:36,374
<I> but I insisted ... </ i>

682
01:05:36,675 --> 01:05:38,175
<I> and accepted. </ I>

683
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:41,777
<I> I was left alone with Laura ... </ i>

684
01:05:42,879 --> 01:05:44,979
<I> in the middle of a huge piece. </ I>

685
01:05:46,281 --> 01:05:48,981
<I> He was cold and fear. </ I>

686
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:56,185
Then I remembered her smile
the day we met,

687
01:05:57,387 --> 01:06:00,987
their eyes excited,
the day of our wedding,

688
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:03,388
wedding night.

689
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,591
He gave me courage.

690
01:06:11,195 --> 01:06:13,895
<I> I started to put his socks. </ I>

691
01:06:15,997 --> 01:06:17,497
<I> It's slipped ... </ i>

692
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:19,298
<I> delicately ... </ i>

693
01:06:19,999 --> 01:06:21,499
<I> on her thighs. </ I>

694
01:06:24,002 --> 01:06:25,502
<I> Then ... </ i>

695
01:06:25,803 --> 01:06:27,603
<I> I put her blouse ... </ i>

696
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:33,006
I buttoned her dress,
I put her jewelry,

697
01:06:34,108 --> 01:06:35,908
their shoes ...

698
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,610
and I pressed gently

699
01:06:40,612 --> 01:06:44,812
<I> his wreath
in her blonde hair. </ i>

700
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:49,516
<I> It was there, I think ... </ i>

701
01:06:50,818 --> 01:06:53,218
<I> that my desire to get
women's clothing ... </ i>

702
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,020
<I> reappeared ... </ i>

703
01:06:56,521 --> 01:06:58,321
<I> as evidence. </ I>

704
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:31,813
- Good day.
- Hi.

705
01:08:32,915 --> 01:08:34,715
Are you okay?
Did you sleep well?

706
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:36,316
Not very well.

707
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:38,917
I told you that bed
it was too small.

708
01:08:39,118 --> 01:08:40,918
It's not that, it's Gilles.

709
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,120
What happened?

710
01:08:43,721 --> 01:08:46,421
I left my cell phone in the bag
and I forgot to call.

711
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,622
He called my mother and she
He said he was not there.

712
01:08:50,324 --> 01:08:51,324
Shit!

713
01:08:51,825 --> 01:08:53,325
You spoke with him?

714
01:08:53,526 --> 01:08:56,526
No. I left many messages,
I'm calling now.

715
01:08:57,627 --> 01:09:00,027
- Are you going to say?
- What?

716
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,828
You're in Crיancy with me.

717
01:09:03,329 --> 01:09:05,429
And why should
to hide it?

718
01:09:07,432 --> 01:09:11,032
You have nothing to reproach.
That's what's important.

719
01:09:20,742 --> 01:09:22,242
I'll be right back.

720
01:09:37,658 --> 01:09:39,758
- It's getting dangerous.
- What?

721
01:09:40,059 --> 01:09:41,559
We must end.

722
01:09:43,261 --> 01:09:44,461
Finish?

723
01:09:45,162 --> 01:09:47,262
- Stop meeting?
- No.

724
01:09:48,964 --> 01:09:50,764
To dress as a woman.

725
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:54,567
I thought you understood me.

726
01:09:55,869 --> 01:09:58,869
You're sick, David.
You should treat yourself.

727
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,575
You're sleeping with David, is that it?

728
01:10:06,677 --> 01:10:08,477
Of course not.
What are you saying?

729
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:13,880
So why do I hide
exiting the weekend together?

730
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:18,783
- He asked me not to tell you anything.
- Why?

731
01:10:19,384 --> 01:10:21,184
Because you were right.

732
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:22,785
Wait ...

733
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:24,486
Any reason for what?

734
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,087
David found that ...

735
01:10:28,589 --> 01:10:30,389
who likes men.

736
01:10:32,492 --> 01:10:33,492
And so?

737
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:35,993
What's it to you?

738
01:10:36,694 --> 01:10:37,694
Y ...

739
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:40,895
He needed to talk to me,
he feels guilty.

740
01:10:40,896 --> 01:10:43,596
Why they were to Crיancy
to tell you this?

741
01:10:43,597 --> 01:10:47,197
Because there ... it feels good.
Near Laura.

742
01:10:52,103 --> 01:10:53,903
It's not easy, you know?

743
01:10:54,405 --> 01:10:57,405
It is especially difficult to assume
after his death.

744
01:10:58,607 --> 01:11:01,007
I feel good for David.

745
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,510
I know.

746
01:11:07,414 --> 01:11:08,914
Why did you say that?

747
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,515
<I> I had to say something. </ I>

748
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,516
<I> If not, sorry. </ I>

749
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:15,317
it's ridiculous.
I'll look like a fool.

750
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:18,918
Is less severe look like
homosexual and transvestite.

751
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:21,319
<I> These lies tired me. </ I>

752
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,120
To dramatize
You should come home.

753
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,321
What for?

754
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:27,422
<I> To see that Gilles
there is nothing between us. </ i>

755
01:11:28,224 --> 01:11:29,724
There is something between us, Claire.

756
01:11:29,925 --> 01:11:33,425
Yes, but not what you think.
Are you free on Friday night?

757
01:11:34,126 --> 01:11:35,626
Are you your friend Virginia?

758
01:11:35,727 --> 01:11:37,227
- Did not I tell you?
- What?

759
01:11:37,528 --> 01:11:39,028
- Not Free.
- Oh no?

760
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,130
- We will be only three.
- Well yes.

761
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,734
- Good night!
- Hi.

762
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:49,735
- Between David. I'll help.
- Thank You.

763
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,740
Claire!
David arrived!

764
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:57,641
With your daughter.

765
01:11:58,643 --> 01:12:00,143
<I> - Are you okay?
- Yes </ i>.

766
01:12:00,444 --> 01:12:02,244
<I> Hello small.
Are you okay? </ I>

767
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:04,445
- Goodnight.
- Hello, Claire.

768
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:09,650
How are you?

769
01:12:10,552 --> 01:12:12,652
I still slept.
He did your bottle?

770
01:12:12,753 --> 01:12:15,753
No, I'll give you sleep well
and we will be quiet.

771
01:12:15,854 --> 01:12:17,654
She is very pretty.
How old are you?

772
01:12:17,655 --> 01:12:19,155
6 months.

773
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:21,956
Let's sit down.
Are you going to get a bottle?

774
01:12:22,057 --> 01:12:23,257
Yes, come in.

775
01:12:24,259 --> 01:12:27,259
- You want to heat?
- No, it's warm.

776
01:12:29,162 --> 01:12:30,962
I should have been
as Virginia.

777
01:12:30,963 --> 01:12:33,363
- Why do you say that?
- It would be more honest.

778
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,167
I was hungry.

779
01:12:39,868 --> 01:12:41,868
Yes, it is gluttonous.

780
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:49,875
Are not you looking forward to?

781
01:13:01,387 --> 01:13:03,187
But suddenly you came?

782
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:06,889
Yes. Anyway ...

783
01:13:08,491 --> 01:13:11,491
I always
I attracted men.

784
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:12,592
Who knows.

785
01:13:13,994 --> 01:13:15,494
Still before Laura?

786
01:13:17,497 --> 01:13:20,497
While we were together
I never felt like.

787
01:13:20,998 --> 01:13:23,998
He returned after his death.
As evidence.

788
01:13:24,499 --> 01:13:26,619
Today is not a problem.
They come from all sides.

789
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:31,801
I see it at work. Quarter
types is homosexual.

790
01:13:32,402 --> 01:13:34,802
A lesbians
the note less.

791
01:13:34,903 --> 01:13:37,003
- What will you do with Lucie?
- It is true ...

792
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,304
deceased mother
homosexual father.

793
01:13:39,405 --> 01:13:40,905
It will be complicated.

794
01:13:41,907 --> 01:13:43,407
No, I think not.

795
01:13:44,409 --> 01:13:46,209
I also decided to go back to work.

796
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:47,510
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

797
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:49,711
I need to return to normal life.

798
01:13:50,112 --> 01:13:53,412
My mother got a babysitter
which is responsible for Lucie.

799
01:13:54,914 --> 01:13:56,714
I also see someone.

800
01:13:57,215 --> 01:13:59,615
- Did you meet anyone?
- Yes.

801
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:04,519
I see a psychologist.

802
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,321
- A psychologist?
- Yes.

803
01:14:08,523 --> 01:14:10,023
A woman, very sweet.

804
01:14:11,825 --> 01:14:13,625
It helps me talk to her,

805
01:14:13,926 --> 01:14:15,026
Laura ...

806
01:14:15,127 --> 01:14:16,927
my future with Lucie.

807
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:21,429
She understands me, without judgment.

808
01:14:22,731 --> 01:14:23,931
it's okay.

809
01:14:24,932 --> 01:14:26,732
You can not do wrong.

810
01:14:27,533 --> 01:14:28,733
It's late, I must go.

811
01:14:32,637 --> 01:14:34,437
I think I drank one too many.

812
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,440
Do you mind taking me?

813
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:42,342
I order,
Gilles prefer it.

814
01:14:42,943 --> 01:14:44,443
It does not bother you?

815
01:14:45,144 --> 01:14:46,944
No, no, of course.

816
01:14:47,745 --> 01:14:49,245
I'll get to Lucie.

817
01:14:56,052 --> 01:14:58,152
- Y?
- What?

818
01:14:59,654 --> 01:15:02,054
- There's a guy.
- Because what you say?

819
01:15:02,255 --> 01:15:03,255
No?

820
01:15:03,656 --> 01:15:05,156
He has adventures.

821
01:15:05,357 --> 01:15:06,857
As I pregתntaselo.

822
01:15:11,262 --> 01:15:12,262
David.

823
01:15:12,563 --> 01:15:14,663
What it is this story
a psychologist?

824
01:15:14,664 --> 01:15:16,164
Thou counseled me.

825
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:18,065
- Did you tell?
- Yes.

826
01:15:18,566 --> 01:15:19,766
What did he say?

827
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:23,967
Each must find their way
to grieve.

828
01:15:25,769 --> 01:15:27,869
Claire, do we see the
next week?

829
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:28,970
No.

830
01:15:29,671 --> 01:15:30,871
It ended.

831
01:15:39,781 --> 01:15:43,381
Claire see much better.
Almost no talk about Laura.

832
01:15:43,482 --> 01:15:44,482
Oh yeah?

833
01:15:45,984 --> 01:15:47,484
it is funny.

834
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,785
When I met Claire was
jealous of his relationship with Laura.

835
01:15:50,986 --> 01:15:52,486
They were so close.

836
01:15:52,887 --> 01:15:54,687
I even thought I had
something between them.

837
01:15:54,688 --> 01:15:56,488
No, Laura always
Men liked.

838
01:15:56,489 --> 01:15:58,589
Of course, Claire too.

839
01:16:00,892 --> 01:16:03,892
- In any case it gave us ideas.
- Any ideas?

840
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:05,293
Yes.

841
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,694
We decided to have a child.

842
01:16:25,012 --> 01:16:27,712
- Do you want me to help you?
- No thanks, it's fine.

843
01:17:46,692 --> 01:17:47,692
Well ...

844
01:17:48,393 --> 01:17:49,893
You have a good day.

845
01:17:50,094 --> 01:17:51,094
Good day.

846
01:19:29,392 --> 01:19:31,192
Shit!
Sorry!

847
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:34,995
- I'm a mess today.
- No, play well.

848
01:19:35,296 --> 01:19:36,496
No, I'm not in shape.

849
01:19:37,097 --> 01:19:38,097
Look.

850
01:19:42,602 --> 01:19:45,002
- What is he doing here?
- I proposed a double.

851
01:19:46,904 --> 01:19:48,704
- How are you David?
- Completely.

852
01:19:49,005 --> 01:19:50,205
I was waiting for you.

853
01:19:50,606 --> 01:19:53,006
- Hello, Claire.
- Hi David.

854
01:19:54,308 --> 01:19:56,708
- Play the two.
- No, let's make a double.

855
01:19:56,909 --> 01:19:58,109
we are three.

856
01:19:58,110 --> 01:19:59,910
Play the two against me.

857
01:19:59,911 --> 01:20:00,911
Come on.

858
01:20:00,912 --> 01:20:02,712
Let's undo, Claire.

859
01:20:09,419 --> 01:20:11,819
- Are you okay?
- Very stressed.

860
01:20:12,821 --> 01:20:14,621
I like you more than skirt.

861
01:20:16,223 --> 01:20:17,223
Come on.

862
01:20:42,449 --> 01:20:43,449
Bravo!

863
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:45,050
I drink.

864
01:20:46,552 --> 01:20:48,652
Why do not you call me anymore?

865
01:20:49,153 --> 01:20:50,953
I do not want to bother.

866
01:20:51,454 --> 01:20:53,554
You said it was
all it finished.

867
01:20:53,955 --> 01:20:56,355
- No, I told you ...
- I was scared.

868
01:20:56,757 --> 01:20:58,857
- Of what?
- From start over.

869
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:03,160
- Did you stop it?
- Yes,

870
01:21:03,762 --> 01:21:06,762
- Since we stopped seeing each other.
- We Play?

871
01:21:42,099 --> 01:21:43,899
DRESS FOR MEN

872
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:37,051
- Well ...
- Sure.

873
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:38,452
Sharapova prefer.

874
01:22:42,055 --> 01:22:45,055
- Would you like a ride?
- Thanks, I came with my car.

875
01:22:45,856 --> 01:22:47,656
And Claire?
You did not expect?

876
01:22:47,757 --> 01:22:50,457
Always expected to
women who shower.

877
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:55,261
Shit!
I forgot my racket!

878
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,774
Are not you well?

879
01:23:13,379 --> 01:23:14,879
I miss Virginia.

880
01:23:21,086 --> 01:23:22,886
Claire!
Wait.

881
01:23:24,088 --> 01:23:25,288
Come with me.

882
01:23:53,317 --> 01:23:55,417
We can not do this to Laura!

883
01:24:03,426 --> 01:24:05,226
How took you!

884
01:24:05,627 --> 01:24:07,427
- Did you see David?
- Yes.

885
01:24:07,728 --> 01:24:09,828
- Is coming?
- He said he did not expect it.

886
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:33,370
Apology for tennis.
13:30 am-Hotel Virginia

887
01:25:14,992 --> 01:25:16,492
Good morning, Claire.

888
01:25:17,594 --> 01:25:19,094
Good morning, Virginia.

889
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:27,601
Sorry, I lingered.

890
01:25:28,703 --> 01:25:30,803
I moved into a room.

891
01:25:33,306 --> 01:25:34,806
Here are ladies.

892
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:36,907
I ordered champagne.

893
01:25:37,909 --> 01:25:39,409
For our reunion.

894
01:25:41,712 --> 01:25:42,912
- Thank You.
- Thank You.

895
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:57,726
You made me fall.

896
01:25:59,928 --> 01:26:01,128
Sorry.

897
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:05,330
It was during the dinner
home I realized ...

898
01:26:06,231 --> 01:26:08,031
I was falling for you.

899
01:26:09,733 --> 01:26:12,733
You were right. it would have been
better to stop, right?

900
01:26:13,534 --> 01:26:14,734
And in tennis ...

901
01:26:15,635 --> 01:26:17,135
when you told me ...

902
01:26:17,536 --> 01:26:19,636
"I miss Virginia"

903
01:26:20,337 --> 01:26:22,137
all awoke.

904
01:26:22,838 --> 01:26:24,338
I also missed.

905
01:26:27,142 --> 01:26:29,242
I can not waste my life.

906
01:26:30,244 --> 01:26:31,544
It's in me.

907
01:26:32,546 --> 01:26:34,646
Only you can help
to assume.

908
01:26:36,048 --> 01:26:40,248
What do you want to do?
Going shopping with your friend?

909
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:42,350
Let's lie ...

910
01:26:42,851 --> 01:26:44,351
as eager as I have.

911
01:27:25,193 --> 01:27:26,693
What are we doing here?

912
01:27:30,698 --> 01:27:31,998
Do not say anything.

913
01:30:02,649 --> 01:30:03,849
What's up?

914
01:30:05,351 --> 01:30:08,351
- Sorry, but it can not be.
- Why?

915
01:30:10,854 --> 01:30:12,054
You are a man.

916
01:31:21,124 --> 01:31:23,224
What are you doing?
You are crazy?

917
01:31:37,038 --> 01:31:38,538
No, I am woman.

918
01:31:54,555 --> 01:31:56,055
There are Liz and Robert.

919
01:31:56,056 --> 01:31:57,556
- Good day.
- Good day.

920
01:31:57,557 --> 01:31:59,357
It's horrible, my children,
horrible.

921
01:31:59,358 --> 01:32:00,558
What happened to him?

922
01:32:00,559 --> 01:32:02,959
He was hit by a car
when he crossing the street.

923
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,160
How is it going?

924
01:32:04,261 --> 01:32:07,861
This unconscious, in a coma,
They say it may be as well.

925
01:32:08,262 --> 01:32:09,262
It is atrocious!

926
01:32:09,563 --> 01:32:11,963
Laura left us six months ago
and now David.

927
01:32:11,964 --> 01:32:14,064
He is still alive,
not buried.

928
01:32:14,065 --> 01:32:17,465
You're right, but I think Lucie
which may be an orphan.

929
01:32:17,466 --> 01:32:19,366
- Where is Lucie?
- With the nanny,

930
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,467
we can not take care.

931
01:32:21,468 --> 01:32:22,668
Can you see David?

932
01:32:23,769 --> 01:32:24,769
Yes ...

933
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:26,270
but ...

934
01:32:27,572 --> 01:32:30,272
- We should say something before.
- What?

935
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:34,075
Tell them.

936
01:32:35,477 --> 01:32:36,477
is that ...

937
01:32:39,081 --> 01:32:41,781
David, do not know why ...

938
01:32:42,383 --> 01:32:45,083
It was found ...
... Dressed as a woman.

939
01:32:49,088 --> 01:32:50,588
- What woman?
- Yes.

940
01:32:50,689 --> 01:32:53,389
She wore a skirt and a wig.

941
01:32:54,691 --> 01:32:55,691
Oh yeah?

942
01:32:55,992 --> 01:32:58,392
I do not understand why
I was dressed like that.

943
01:32:58,393 --> 01:33:00,793
I think it would
a costume party.

944
01:33:01,094 --> 01:33:04,394
- It was early afternoon, Robert.
- It is true.

945
01:33:05,095 --> 01:33:07,495
Of course, that
Just between you.

946
01:33:07,696 --> 01:33:10,396
- No one must know.
- Keep us confidence, Liz.

947
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:34,820
David.

948
01:33:37,723 --> 01:33:38,723
David.

949
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:58,040
Did you you know that besides
fucking he dressed as a woman?

950
01:33:58,141 --> 01:33:59,141
Yes.

951
01:33:59,942 --> 01:34:02,342
It is incredible!
Why did not you tell me?

952
01:34:05,646 --> 01:34:06,646
Excuse Me.

953
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:12,451
Are you sure the little one?

954
01:34:14,153 --> 01:34:15,953
Yes, I am her godmother.

955
01:34:16,254 --> 01:34:19,254
How are we going to do?
We can not improvise.

956
01:34:19,755 --> 01:34:22,155
I will take leave and
I'll take care of it.

957
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:23,656
I promised to Laura.

958
01:34:23,857 --> 01:34:24,857
Thank You.

959
01:34:24,858 --> 01:34:26,958
Do not forget to give the bottle
in an hour.

960
01:34:27,159 --> 01:34:28,659
- Yes, good night.
- Goodbye.

961
01:34:32,163 --> 01:34:33,663
Lucie, how are you?

962
01:34:34,865 --> 01:34:36,065
We came to get you.

963
01:34:36,366 --> 01:34:39,066
You'll sleep at home.

964
01:34:39,467 --> 01:34:40,467
Lucie.

965
01:34:41,168 --> 01:34:42,168
I you open.

966
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:51,977
It is done.

967
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:54,679
There, that's it.

968
01:34:57,383 --> 01:34:58,683
It is done ...

969
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:00,184
It is done ...

970
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:36,620
David.

971
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:41,022
David, I am.
I came with Lucie.

972
01:35:42,524 --> 01:35:44,024
Do you hear me?

973
01:35:45,226 --> 01:35:46,226
David?

974
01:35:47,027 --> 01:35:49,127
You are right to be
come with the child.

975
01:35:49,428 --> 01:35:50,928
Do you think?

976
01:35:51,029 --> 01:35:52,629
The more you are
present and discuss it ...

977
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:54,430
more will help you wake up.

978
01:36:18,355 --> 01:36:19,555
¿Virginia?

979
01:36:22,358 --> 01:36:24,158
Virginia, I am.

980
01:36:27,262 --> 01:36:29,062
You are with him?

981
01:36:32,266 --> 01:36:33,766
Do you hear me?

982
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:37,970
Virginia!

983
01:36:44,377 --> 01:36:45,377
David!

984
01:36:49,782 --> 01:36:51,282
Lady!
Lady!

985
01:36:51,683 --> 01:36:53,483
- What's up?
- He opened his eyes!

986
01:36:55,486 --> 01:36:57,286
Sir?
Can you hear me sir?

987
01:36:58,888 --> 01:37:01,288
- I swear he opened his eyes.
- I think.

988
01:37:01,789 --> 01:37:04,789
It happens, but not to
said to have left the dream.

989
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:07,991
His presence makes him well.

990
01:37:12,096 --> 01:37:13,096
David.

991
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:16,399
Hi!

992
01:37:18,902 --> 01:37:20,702
Do not talk very loud,
Lucie is sleeping.

993
01:37:22,705 --> 01:37:23,905
It's okay?

994
01:37:25,307 --> 01:37:27,407
Yes, just he fell asleep.

995
01:37:32,212 --> 01:37:33,712
I have good news.

996
01:37:34,413 --> 01:37:35,413
What?

997
01:37:36,215 --> 01:37:38,015
Max called me this afternoon ...

998
01:37:38,416 --> 01:37:40,216
and he decided to promote me ...

999
01:37:40,817 --> 01:37:42,317
and raise my.

1000
01:37:43,419 --> 01:37:44,519
Great.

1001
01:37:46,522 --> 01:37:48,322
You could rejoice.

1002
01:37:48,523 --> 01:37:50,023
But, I'm glad.

1003
01:37:50,424 --> 01:37:51,424
Well ...

1004
01:37:51,725 --> 01:37:53,225
What happened?

1005
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:55,827
Nothing.

1006
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:00,130
David still in a coma ...

1007
01:38:03,434 --> 01:38:06,834
It will take time.
Do not worry.

1008
01:38:07,836 --> 01:38:10,836
I have the impression of being
living as with Laura.

1009
01:38:11,637 --> 01:38:13,137
In the same hospital.

1010
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:16,640
It is horrible.

1011
01:38:17,842 --> 01:38:20,242
It's horrible, but leaves
looking back.

1012
01:38:22,245 --> 01:38:24,045
Forget about Laura.

1013
01:38:24,946 --> 01:38:26,746
Now it's David.

1014
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:31,250
If you're right.

1015
01:38:32,852 --> 01:38:34,352
Now it's David.

1016
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:44,819
I used to relate
something strange men,

1017
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:48,720
as light as the
ash of his cigarette.

1018
01:39:49,722 --> 01:39:53,322
Evenings in Daban
Palace of Versailles.

1019
01:39:53,523 --> 01:39:57,123
It was only straw castles

1020
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:01,424
and wasting my time
gold in the desert.

1021
01:40:02,126 --> 01:40:06,326
She was alone when I met you.

1022
01:40:06,927 --> 01:40:09,327
The others were buried ...

1023
01:40:09,428 --> 01:40:11,828
you were alive.

1024
01:40:11,929 --> 01:40:15,729
You sang as a child singing.

1025
01:40:16,430 --> 01:40:21,130
You were happy as an Italian
when you know you will

1026
01:40:21,331 --> 01:40:23,431
Love and wine.

1027
01:40:24,032 --> 01:40:25,832
And for the first time

1028
01:40:26,433 --> 01:40:28,833
I finally felt ...

1029
01:40:29,034 --> 01:40:31,734
woman ...

1030
01:40:32,435 --> 01:40:35,435
woman ...

1031
01:40:35,536 --> 01:40:38,536
a woman

1032
01:40:38,737 --> 01:40:41,137
you.

1033
01:40:41,538 --> 01:40:43,938
Woman ...

1034
01:40:44,739 --> 01:40:47,439
woman ...

1035
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,540
a woman ...

1036
01:40:50,641 --> 01:40:52,741
you.

1037
01:40:54,644 --> 01:40:58,544
You had a little the air of yesteryear

1038
01:40:58,845 --> 01:41:02,145
where galloping
white horses.

1039
01:41:02,746 --> 01:41:06,346
Your face was serious
and your clear smile.

1040
01:41:06,747 --> 01:41:10,347
I walked right
to your glow.

1041
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:14,448
Today, no matter what
We do, make love,

1042
01:41:14,649 --> 01:41:18,849
near you time
It seems so short.

1043
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:24,150
Because you're a man
and tender are

1044
01:41:24,751 --> 01:41:28,051
and you know make beautiful
our lives.

1045
01:41:28,952 --> 01:41:31,352
You're happy as an Italian

1046
01:41:31,353 --> 01:41:34,953
when you know you will
Love and wine.

1047
01:41:37,056 --> 01:41:40,056
It is always like
the first time when ...

1048
01:41:40,557 --> 01:41:42,957
when I finally did it ...

1049
01:41:43,758 --> 01:41:46,458
woman ...

1050
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:50,160
woman ...

1051
01:41:51,562 --> 01:41:53,062
a ...

1052
01:42:16,887 --> 01:42:18,487
She has fun ...

1053
01:42:25,895 --> 01:42:27,395
We are here!

1054
01:42:27,496 --> 01:42:28,696
Who is it?

1055
01:42:32,801 --> 01:42:34,601
- Good night, Gilles.
- Goodnight.

1056
01:42:44,812 --> 01:42:46,112
I want you to meet a friend.

1057
01:42:48,014 --> 01:42:49,014
But ...

1058
01:42:49,615 --> 01:42:51,115
you, David.

1059
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:54,918
No, my friend Virginia.

1060
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:58,320
She is the mother of Lucie.

1061
01:43:06,028 --> 01:43:07,228
Lucie's mother.

1062
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:11,430
I'll explain.
I'll be back.

1063
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:32,351
7 YEARS LATER
