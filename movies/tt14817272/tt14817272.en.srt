2
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,583
First time in Croatia?

3
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,708
- Yeah.
- This is the old city.

4
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,833
It's beautiful.

5
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,166
We're here.

6
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,583
Uh, in case you need a taxi
while you're here.

7
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,500
Oh. Thank you, Zain.

8
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,500
- Enjoy,
- Wait, I need to pay you.

9
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,250
Uh, it's been taken care of.

10
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,375
Oh, well, at least let me tip you then.

11
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,875
Please.

12
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,625
Thank you.

13
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,583
You made it!

14
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,583
Aw, it's so good to see you.

15
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,125
You too.

16
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,833
Look at you.

17
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,166
I can't believe we're finally here.
We're doing this.

18
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,625
I know. Come on.
I've been waiting to open the duty-free.

19
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,583
Yeah. Oh, you waited. That's a first.

20
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,041
Airbnb deluxe.

21
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,916
Hey, uh...

22
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,875
Thanks for paying for the taxi.

23
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,333
Thank Jay. It's all on him.

24
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,750
Wow! Kate, this is incredible.

25
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,083
Can we move in? Stay forever?

26
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,833
- Okay.
- Whoo-hoo!

27
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,396
That's it.

28
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,583
Never going home. Think Rob would notice?

29
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,333
Probably. But who cares?

30
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,125
- Hope you brought your swimsuit.
- Oh, uh...

31
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,625
- I think I forgot.
- Well, you'll just have to go naked.

32
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,166
Here you go.

33
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,476
Whoo!

34
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,291
Ooh, fancy.

35
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,583
Dom Pérignon.

36
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,083
Okay.

37
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,583
- Finally!
- Yeah.

38
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,875
To weekends away.

39
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,750
With best friends.

40
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,916
Oh.

41
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,541
I got you something.

42
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,401
- You didn't have to get me anything.
- I wanted to, though.

43
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,916
I just wanted to say thank you
for planning this whole thing.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,333
And I've... I've really missed you so much.

45
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,833
It's beautiful, Beth. Thank you.

46
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,291
Here. I know you love black onyx.

47
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,291
Oh!

48
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,875
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

49
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,458
Where is it?

50
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,291
I... I got it online.

51
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,750
- I can send it back.
- No. No.

52
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,625
I love it.

53
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,333
I love you.

54
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,666
I love you too.

55
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,291
Ugh.

56
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,750
I don't know what to wear.
Nothing fancy enough.

57
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,392
<i>So just go in your granny panties.
You'll still look great.</i>

58
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,708
I'm so tired. I just want to go to bed.

59
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,625
<i>So go to bed. It's your holiday too.</i>

60
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,458
No, no. Kate booked a restaurant.
It'll be fun.

61
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,125
Tell me more about Aster.

62
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,916
Are you missing mommy?

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,541
<i>Are you missing mommy?</i>

64
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,333
<i>- Mama.
- Yeah.</i>

65
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,625
<i>She misses your boobs, she says.</i>

66
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,458
<i>So do I.</i>

67
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,791
It'll have to do.

68
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,625
Here I come.

69
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,500
Ta-da!

70
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,125
Wow, Kate!

71
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,458
What do you think? New dress.

72
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,166
I went on the post-breakup shopping spree
to end all shopping sprees.

73
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,208
You look amazing.

74
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,125
Oh, hey, Rob. How's it going?

75
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,125
<i>Good.</i>

76
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,916
Oh, is that my gorgeous goddaughter?

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,625
Aw. Hi.

78
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,791
- Give her a kiss from me.
<i>- I will.</i>

79
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,583
<i>I've got to put her down actually.
You guys have a good night.</i>

80
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,625
<i>- Don't get too drunk.</i>
- We will.

81
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,708
- And we will.
- We definitely will.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,625
Night, sweetie. I love you.

83
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,976
- I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
<i>- Have a good time. Love you.</i>

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,083
I'm half wasted already.

85
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,708
You're such a lightweight.

86
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,791
Ah, if I break my neck
in these things, it's your fault.

87
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,291
You look like a supermodel.
You should keep them.

88
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,295
- They'll look great at the supermarket.
- Hello.

89
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,375
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,541
Oh. This is, um...

91
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:03,958
Sebastian.

92
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,416
- The owner.
- Oh.

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,833
- Have you settled in okay?
- Yeah. Hi, I'm Beth.

94
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,392
It's nice to meet you.

95
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,541
Everything's great.

96
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,416
Come on. Taxi's here.

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Bye.

98
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,041
Do you know what you want?

99
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,166
I don't know,
but I need to eat soon.

100
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,458
Yeah, you do.

101
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,708
Let's get oysters.

102
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,958
Jesus, are they gold-plated?

103
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,875
I keep telling you it's on Jay.

104
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,135
He still hasn't
taken me off his credit card.

105
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,568
I intend on discovering
what the limit is before he notices.

106
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,708
Won't he be mad?

107
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,791
With any luck, he'll have an aneurysm
and drop dead on top of his assistant.

108
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,958
So, uh, have we decided?

109
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,958
Hello.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,125
Uh, we'll start with a dozen raw oysters
and a bottle of champagne.

111
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,333
- The most expensive one on the menu.
- Excellent.

112
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,916
Mmm...

113
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,875
No?

114
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,750
What?

115
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,625
I've been a crap friend.

116
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,791
I should've been there for you.

117
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,375
You had a baby. You're forgiven.

118
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Are you okay?

119
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,333
Yeah.

120
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm fine. Couldn't care less about Jay.

121
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,083
- And what about polyamory, girl? Ooh!
- Polyamory, huh?

122
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,875
I can barely manage one relationship.

123
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,833
Who's talking about relationship?

124
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,166
Anyway, enough about me. How about you?

125
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,583
How's things with Rob?

126
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,791
Good.

127
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,083
They're rea... They're good.

128
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,625
He's really great with Aster.

129
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,083
Mmm, and what about with you?

130
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,791
Uh...

131
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,208
He's trying.

132
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,083
How hard is he trying?

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,166
Are you getting any at least?

134
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,625
Kate.

135
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,708
What?

136
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,625
How long has it been?

137
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,375
Um...

138
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,458
Over a year.

139
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,583
Wow. Oh.

140
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,666
Um...

141
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,875
Isn't it about time
you got back on the horse?

142
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,333
I... I just don't feel like it.

143
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,291
Is it Rob?

144
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,684
- Is he not doing it for you anymore?
- It's not Rob.

145
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,791
A body never lies.

146
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,583
No, no, it's me.

147
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,666
It's...

148
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,208
It's, uh...

149
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,791
- Have you thought about leaving him?
- What?

150
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:42,291
If you're not happy,
take it from me, divorce is the answer.

151
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,625
Especially when it comes
with a big fat alimony paycheck.

152
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,333
We're just going through...

153
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,416
...a rough patch.

154
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,583
You've said that before.

155
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,530
- Beth...
- Here we are.

156
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,875
- One for you.
- Thank you.

157
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,125
Excuse me, may I?

158
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,791
Yes. Thank you.

159
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,333
- Thanks a lot.
- Not a problem.

160
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,875
You're such an asshole.

161
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,916
Shut up. Go away. Go away.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,458
I'm afraid the card was rejected.

163
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,666
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

164
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,750
Okay.

165
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,750
- Oh, wow.
- Stop calling me.

166
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,708
- One minute and, uh...
- Of course.

167
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,791
Bye.

168
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,000
Everything okay?

169
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,541
- Jay.
- Did he find out about the card?

170
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,708
Yeah. Turns out I did discover the limit.

171
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,458
Oh!

172
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,375
Do you want me to go halves?

173
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,750
No. No, no, no.

174
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,208
- You get the drinks at the next place.
- Kate, I'm so sorry. I'm tired.

175
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,517
- And my boobs are like gonna explode.
- No, no, no.

176
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,416
I have to pump. They're full, and I can't.

177
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,708
- And we have the bike tour tomorrow.
- Oh, yeah, the bike tour.

178
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,666
Oh, come on.

179
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,083
Let's relive our misspent youth.

180
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,125
It took me months
to convince you to come away.

181
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,958
Who knows when we're going to do it again.

182
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,000
Come on.

183
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,291
Uh...

184
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,833
The entrance is just around there.

185
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,250
Uh, thank you, Zain.

186
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,708
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I just want to fix
my face and powder my nose.

187
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,250
- Uh, are you from here?
- No.

188
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,625
Syrian.

189
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,708
American?

190
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,916
Uh, yeah.

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,333
California originally, but I've lived
in London the last 15 years.

192
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,041
You left Syria because of the war.

193
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,708
Hm.

194
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,041
Do you miss home?

195
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,101
Oh, you speak Arabic?

196
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,541
No, not, not very well.
Um, just a little bit.

197
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,041
I work with the Global Rescue Initiative,
or I used to.

198
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,166
I know them.

199
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,750
Cool.

200
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,250
Okay. I'm ready. Let's go.

201
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,083
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

202
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,833
Okay.

203
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,291
Yeah.

204
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
What do you want?

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, just water.

206
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,583
Let me get these.

207
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,333
- No, no, you get the next round.
- What can I get you?

208
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,833
Two gin and tonics.

209
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,333
Oh my God, look over there. Hot.

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
- Here you go.
- We should go over there.

211
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,583
- Follow me.
- Okay.

212
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,291
Coming through.

213
00:11:56,041 --> 00:12:00,458
- Mind if we join you?
- No, I'm sure they're waiting for someone.

214
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,541
No, no, please, be our guests.

215
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,333
- Hello.
- Hi.

216
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,736
- Beth. Hi.
- Hey, beauty.

217
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah. Oh.

218
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,666
Oh.

219
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,291
Oh.

220
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,541
I don't think I've seen you here before.

221
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,125
I would have noticed you.

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,375
I love your dress.
You look like a disco ball.

223
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,125
You want to see pictures of my baby?

224
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,583
When was the last time
you got hit on by someone that hot?

225
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,250
He's not hitting on me.

226
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,458
Yeah, he is.

227
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,625
Come on, we were just saying
you need to get back on the horse.

228
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,166
I... I'm married.

229
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,750
So? Rob doesn't have to find out.

230
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,083
Are you joking?

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,041
One night of excitement
might bring you out of your rut.

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,416
Manhattan for the lady.

233
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,291
Thank you.

234
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,083
We were just saying
how you should come back to ours.

235
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,041
Bitch!

236
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,666
Kate.

237
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:07,291
<i>Hi, you've got Kate,
or maybe you haven't, so leave a message.</i>

238
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,780
Hey, did you get my text?

239
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,083
- What? No. Sorry.
<i>- I'm really worried.</i>

240
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,000
<i>It's already noon,
and Kate hasn't come home.</i>

241
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:17,958
Okay.

242
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,333
<i>So she's probably gone for a coffee
or a wander or something.</i>

243
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,375
<i>- Did you have a good night?
- </i>Yeah.

244
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,375
I did. I drank a bit much.

245
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,875
<i>Honestly, I can barely remember anything.</i>

246
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,041
Right. And what are you doing today?

247
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,625
We're meant to be doing a bike tour.

248
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,625
There you go. That's why she's vanished.
Should've told her it was a shopping tour.

249
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,958
She... She didn't leave a note,
and she hasn't texted either.

250
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,791
<i>Did you have an argument?</i>

251
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,583
- Bitch!
- No.

252
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,500
<i>Then don't hang around waiting.</i>

253
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,000
<i>Get out. Enjoy yourself.</i>

254
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,541
<i>- I'll speak to you later. Yeah?
- </i>Okay.

255
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,125
- I'll let you know if I hear. Love you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

256
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,416
- Hi.
- Hi.

257
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,333
I'm sorry to bother you. Uh...

258
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,166
Have you see my friend?

259
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,291
I'm looking for her. Um, Kate.

260
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,500
I think she went out,
and I can't get a hold of her.

261
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,375
She's not answering her phone.

262
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,750
You haven't seen her, have you?

263
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,833
No.

264
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,916
Okay. Thank you.

265
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,000
You're not allowed to have parties.
It says so very clearly in the rules.

266
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,583
And I have to charge you
for the two extra guests that stayed over.

267
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,333
<i>What was the name of the bar?</i>

268
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,791
<i>I can't remember the name.</i>

269
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,541
Okay, let me see her photo.

270
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,625
So you brought two men back
to your apartment.

271
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,625
- And you don't remember their names.
- Well...

272
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,333
No, I don't...

273
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,458
- Had you been drinking?
- Yeah, a little.

274
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,000
More than a little
if you don't remember anything.

275
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,583
I'm... I'm just not used to drinking,
that's all.

276
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,041
I... I just had a baby. So...

277
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:17,333
Okay, your friend
probably go out clubbing or to a bar.

278
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,458
No, uh, we're here together.

279
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,541
So we're supposed to be doing things,
sightseeing and...

280
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,416
She's not answering her phone.

281
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,250
I think I found blood.

282
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,291
Did you check the hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident.

283
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,708
Yeah. I did, but there's no record
of her being admitted.

284
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,916
Is everything okay?

285
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,666
Yeah. Some tourist.

286
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,375
Her friend ditched her
for some guy, and she's upset.

287
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,875
Does she have her bag
with her? Her wallet, her passport, keys?

288
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,500
Yes. I checked.

289
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,416
I can handle it.

290
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,086
Can I file
a missing persons report?

291
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,750
No, you can't
because you need to wait 24 hours.

292
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,750
Most people show up before then.

293
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,708
I'm sure your friend will too.

294
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,750
<i>Hello.</i>

295
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,791
Zain.

296
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,083
- Thanks for picking me up.
- It was close by. It's no bother.

297
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,666
I couldn't remember the name
of the bar last night.

298
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,416
The Blue Parlour.

299
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,125
That's it.

300
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,666
Has something happened?

301
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,791
Did you lose something?

302
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,833
My friend.

303
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,125
Uh, no need.

304
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,083
- You want me to come in with you?
- No.

305
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,166
Sure?

306
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,791
Yeah, it's okay.

307
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Thank you.

308
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,041
<i>You served us.</i>

309
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,000
We were sitting right there with two guys.

310
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,750
She was wearing a blue dress.

311
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,958
No, no. Sorry. No.

312
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,791
What are you doing?

313
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,625
Figured you could use some help.

314
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,625
Escorts? As in...

315
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,291
I didn't know
that was an actual, real thing?

316
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,833
I didn't hire them.

317
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,958
Then your friend must have.

318
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,000
No, she didn't hire them either.

319
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,583
One night of excitement

320
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,625
might bring you out of your rut.

321
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,750
Oh my God.

322
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,916
She kept going on and on
about how I needed to have some fun.

323
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,875
I'm such an idiot.

324
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,500
I wondered why he was into me.

325
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,375
The barman says
he's seen them there a lot.

326
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,125
Always with different woman.

327
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,291
Tourists.

328
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,958
They joke about it.

329
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,750
Does he know
how to get a hold of them?

330
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,750
Uh, he only knew their first names.

331
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,750
Mateo and Luka.

332
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,291
Come on. I'll take you back.

333
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,355
<i>You went to the police?</i>

334
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:59,125
<i>I mean, this is Kate we're talking about.
She's not exactly reliable.</i>

335
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,625
<i>No, no, she wouldn't do this to me.
Leave without telling me?</i>

336
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,541
<i>Really?</i>

337
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,708
How many times on a night out did
she ditch you for a bloke she just met?

338
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,708
<i>No,
I've left her dozens of messages.</i>

339
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,708
<i>- Something's happened to her.</i>
- Don't be silly.

340
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,250
<i>I've got some brilliant pictures
to show you of Aster by the way.</i>

341
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,125
<i>Earlier on, we were watching</i>
The Godfather,<i> and it turns out</i>

342
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,333
she really likes the part where they find
the horse's head in the bed.

343
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,833
<i>Great parenting.</i>

344
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,125
I miss her.

345
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,583
<i>Are you okay?</i>

346
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,041
Mm-hmm.

347
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,166
<i>Well, we're seeing you tomorrow.</i>

348
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,506
<i>Do you need me
to pick you up from the airport?</i>

349
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,583
Oh my God.

350
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,458
I can't believe
it's nearly Sunday already.

351
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,333
<i>- I'll have to change my flight.</i>
- You can't.

352
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,625
<i>I've got work on Monday.</i>

353
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,250
<i>- What about Aster?</i>
- You don't think I want to come home, Rob?

354
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,666
But Kate's vanished!

355
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
<i>Yeah.</i>

356
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,208
<i>Yeah. God, of course. Yeah, sorry.</i>

357
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,041
<i>- Do... Do you need me to come over?
- </i>No, It's okay.

358
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'll be fine.

359
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,416
<i>Okay.</i>

360
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,916
<i>All right. Just call if you need me, yeah?</i>

361
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,833
- Okay. Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

362
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,000
<i>Bitch!</i>

363
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,625
Zain.

364
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,666
I think I found them.

365
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,458
<i>I called and said I wanted
to hire them for a private party.</i>

366
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,708
They're meeting us here.

367
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:08,083
What if they don't know anything,
or what if they won't tell us?

368
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,458
- Maybe we should go to the police.
- No, I'll handle it.

369
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,541
Don't worry.

370
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,666
How'd you two meet?

371
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,416
Kate and me?

372
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,541
Uh...

373
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,916
I was on a semester abroad.

374
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,250
We were roommates.

375
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,041
I met my husband Rob through her.

376
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,708
We hit it off straight away.

377
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,583
You and your husband.

378
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,708
No, me and Kate, actually.

379
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,333
We were total opposites,

380
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,000
but just clicked.

381
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,166
You know, right away, she's an extrovert.

382
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,041
- My wife calls it <i>Carneebeh.
- Carneebeh.</i>

383
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,208
- Yeah.
- What is that?

384
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,666
<i>Carneebeh. </i>It's...

385
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,416
She likes to play games.

386
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,791
<i>Carneebeh.</i>

387
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,333
How did you meet your wife?

388
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,041
Mina.

389
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:10,083
She was a doctor at the hospital
where I was doing my nursing training?

390
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:11,833
She's like you,

391
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,375
very trusting of people.

392
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,125
She believed me
when I say I was a nice guy

393
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,250
and agreed to go out with me.

394
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,083
Is Mina okay with you helping me?

395
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
She's dead.

396
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,291
I'm so sorry.

397
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,750
Hey.

398
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,583
Don't worry. I got this.

399
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,166
Hi. Hel...

400
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:48,541
Hey!

401
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,166
- I'm sorry!
- Heh!

402
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,166
Go!

403
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,934
- Where is she?
- What?

404
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,583
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

405
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,833
- The woman you were with Friday night.
- Kate! What have you done with her?

406
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,500
- I have done nothing.
- So why did you run just now?

407
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:40,267
- She hired us for a good time. That's all.
- Don't lie to me!

408
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,892
- What's he saying?
- They took her handbag?

409
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,458
When was the last time you saw her?

410
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,791
3:00 a.m.

411
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,583
What'd you do with the bag? Answer!

412
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,333
They pawned it.

413
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,625
Wait. Did you drug me?

414
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,926
Did you put something
in my water at the bar?

415
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,750
- Answer!
- No!

416
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:12,708
I don't need to drug women.
Come on. Please let me go. Okay?

417
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,166
Don't tell the police, please.

418
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,625
Please, I'll get you the bag.
Okay? Please.

419
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:18,916
<i>I'll take you there.</i>

420
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,166
They're hers.

421
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:31,875
It's dead.

422
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,583
I didn't know
they were stolen!

423
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:43,243
- You think you were drugged?
- I've never been that drunk before?

424
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:46,291
They got me a glass of water.
They could've slipped something into it.

425
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,125
What if they drugged Kate too,
you know? So they could rob us.

426
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,375
Why didn't they take your bag too?

427
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:53,791
Maybe Kate drugged you.

428
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,625
Why would she do that?

429
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,666
Well, she did hire them
to have sex with you.

430
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,875
No, no. She would never hurt me.

431
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,666
I know they know more.

432
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,541
Um...

433
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,333
Maybe don't mention my name.

434
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,750
I don't want to get in trouble.

435
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:21,000
If they revoke my visa,
I have no place else to go.

436
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,083
I get it.

437
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,708
Listen, I'm sorry
for dragging you into all this.

438
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:28,166
You're not dragging me into anything.

439
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,583
Stop saying sorry.

440
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,833
Call me if you need me, okay?

441
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,708
Well, I couldn't wait.

442
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:02,041
And look, now I have proof.
Something must have happened to her.

443
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,309
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Let's start with details.

444
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:08,708
- Your friend's name, date of birth...
- No, I gave this to him already yesterday.

445
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,125
You were there.

446
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,416
Where's the report?

447
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,958
Uh...

448
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:19,000
- You didn't file it?
- He told me to come back in 24 hours.

449
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:21,416
I figured her friend was out partying.

450
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,958
They brought two escorts back
to their apartment.

451
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,166
They were drunk. Probably high on drugs.

452
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,708
No, I... I wasn't doing drugs.
And... I didn't know they were escorts.

453
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,750
Something bad has happened to her.

454
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,375
I know it.

455
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,625
<i>I don't think
they're serial killers, Beth.</i>

456
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:43,541
And even if they are,
I don't know if I care. Look at them.

457
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,375
You need to interview these men.

458
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,208
I think...

459
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:53,291
they might have drugged me
or maybe both of us.

460
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,208
You just said you didn't do drugs.

461
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:58,166
I... I didn't do drugs. I was drugged.

462
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,916
- There's a difference.
- Funny you didn't mention it before.

463
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,958
'Cause I wasn't sure. I'm still not.

464
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,791
Can you get her some water?

465
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,541
Then run these names through the system.

466
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,333
I'm sorry about my colleague.

467
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I need to ask,

468
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,875
is it possible
you may have been assaulted?

469
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:46,541
Well, when we're done here,
we'll take you to the hospital

470
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,875
for a drug test and a checkup.

471
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,333
Okay.

472
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,000
This is a real Dior.

473
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,041
It's worth around

474
00:29:58,791 --> 00:29:59,958
10,000 Euro.

475
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,666
And they admitted they stole it,

476
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,125
and then gave it back to you.

477
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,416
I, eh...

478
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,500
I explained Kate was missing, and I...

479
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:18,208
told them I wouldn't go
to the police if they gave it back to me.

480
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:22,541
Hm.

481
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,041
Any signs of sexual assault
are still inconclusive.

482
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,625
We'll have those results and the results
of the blood test within 24 hours.

483
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,875
What do you mean, Jay?

484
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,918
<i>- It's a classic Kate move.</i>
- Going missing?

485
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:44,000
Always has to be the center of attention.

486
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,000
She wore red on our wedding day, I mean,

487
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,666
should've taken that as a warning
of sharks in the water.

488
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,500
You haven't talked to her then?

489
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,791
<i>No, not for weeks. It's been bliss.</i>

490
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:56,375
- No, no, you talked to her Friday night.
- No, I didn't.

491
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,500
She said you called her
about the credit card.

492
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,416
What credit card? All communication
has to go through our lawyers.

493
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,000
Look, Beth, I can actually guarantee
this whole disappearance act

494
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,583
is a lot of bollocks, all right.

495
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,791
What credit card by the way?

496
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:12,041
What? Are you saying
she's... faking her disappearance?

497
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,083
Why? Why would she do that?

498
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:18,750
Because drama is embedded
in her DNA like an extra chromosome.

499
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:22,875
She once ran off to New York
for a week after we had an argument

500
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,875
with no word if she was dead or alive.

501
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,791
All right, just trust me,
she likes to punish people.

502
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,208
<i>Look, I gotta go. Just call me,
and let me know what happens, all right?</i>

503
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,041
Kate?

504
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:05,583
- What are you doing?
- Checkout is 11:00.

505
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:06,666
Oh.

506
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,041
I'm sorry, I forgot.

507
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,958
There are other guests arriving.

508
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,041
I'll do it.

509
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,125
I'll do it.

510
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,083
- Your friend is still missing.
- Yeah.

511
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,125
- Did you go to the police?
- Yeah, they're looking for her.

512
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,500
I'm staying till they find her.

513
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:31,791
Where?

514
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:33,791
I'll find a hotel.

515
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,416
I have a spare room.

516
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,375
Downstairs.

517
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,916
<i>I rent it sometimes.</i>

518
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,000
<i>I'll give you a discount.</i>

519
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:47,333
If your friend shows up,
at least you will be close by.

520
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:52,958
Okay.

521
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,000
You're down here.

522
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:25,625
Mm-hm.

523
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:33,166
Uh, there should be towels
in the bathroom, and...

524
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,375
just let me know
if you need anything else.

525
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,166
Thanks.

526
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,833
I think you're gonna love it.

527
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:16,833
<i>You've reached Rob,
leave me a message after the...</i>

528
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:43,791
Beth.

529
00:35:58,541 --> 00:36:00,666
You helped yourself.

530
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,250
Uh...

531
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,166
Yeah. Is that okay?

532
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:11,750
Of course.

533
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,333
Is that your recording studio?

534
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:17,916
Yes.

535
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,291
I'm a composer.

536
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,208
Are you hungry?

537
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,791
I was about to order in.

538
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:27,458
Uh...

539
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:32,166
Uh, I... I was about to go out actually.

540
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,416
Good night.

541
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,625
Hi. Thanks.

542
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,833
I had to get out of there.

543
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Have you eaten?

544
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,916
Let's get some food
before we start looking.

545
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
- I know a very good Syrian...
- Beth.

546
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:55,625
Rob?

547
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,958
Uh, what are you doing here?

548
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,541
I've been calling you all day
to let you know I was on my way.

549
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,458
- I was worried about you.
- Where's Aster?

550
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,458
- She's with a babysitter.
- Overnight?

551
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:09,000
My parents are away.
Remember? In the Dordogne. She'll be fine.

552
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,458
- Sorry, am I interrupting something?
- No. This is Zain.

553
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,750
He's a taxi driver.
And he's been helping me look for Kate.

554
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,541
Nice to meet you.

555
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:19,458
You too.

556
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,333
- Okay, I'll... I'll go.
- Okay.

557
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:25,250
Let me know if you hear anything.

558
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,500
- I will. Thanks. Sorry.
- Bye.

559
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,583
Bye.

560
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,291
Who the bloody hell is he?

561
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:36,976
- I just told you. He's the taxi driver.
- Who you were going to dinner with.

562
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,625
Give me a break. He's been helping me.

563
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:43,250
He... He drove me and Kate to a bar
the night that she went missing...

564
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,583
Beth, are you kidding?
What if he's involved?

565
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,250
No.

566
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,173
You were just about
to get into a car with him.

567
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,416
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm not.

568
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,583
Jesus, Beth.

569
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,208
Hey.

570
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,291
Come here.

571
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,125
I'm sorry.

572
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,541
I am sorry, all right?

573
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,333
I didn't mean to upset you.

574
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,791
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've flown straight over.

575
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,267
I couldn't tell you over the phone.

576
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,291
Escorts?

577
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,125
She hired them?

578
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:26,000
Do the police think
they're involved in her going missing?

579
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,375
They don't seem to have a clue.

580
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,338
And they're barely lifting a finger
to find her.

581
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,541
What if Jay's right,
and she's messing with us?

582
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,458
No. I know Kate. She'd...

583
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:38,000
She likes to be the center of attention,
yes, but she wouldn't do this to me.

584
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:44,791
Hello.

585
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,666
<i>She's been in the water
for some time.</i>

586
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:57,833
Oh.

587
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:01,875
It's her.

588
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,208
Oh my God!

589
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,625
She drowned?

590
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:18,500
It's too soon to say.
The autopsy will tell us more.

591
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:21,875
- But you think it was an accident?
- That she fell in?

592
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,583
Or do you think she was killed?

593
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,833
We need to wait
for the result of the autopsy.

594
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,916
We'll be in touch when we know more.

595
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:05,833
What are you doing?

596
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,875
Couldn't sleep.

597
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,541
I keep seeing her

598
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,666
lying there on that slab.

599
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,625
I feel bad, you know,
for finding her annoying.

600
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,666
I should've been nicer.

601
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,392
I have to get going soon.
You sure you don't want to come with me?

602
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:49,208
We talked about this. I have to...

603
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,750
stay till after the autopsy and...

604
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,875
- There's the arrangements to figure out.
- Yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

605
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,666
I know. You're right.

606
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,833
Is the coroner certain?

607
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,500
Yes.

608
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,750
It's now a murder inquiry.

609
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:36,083
They can't tell if she was sexually
assaulted given the state of the body.

610
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:40,375
And the fact
she had sex with multiple partners

611
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:42,125
on the night she went missing.

612
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,041
Can I see her?

613
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,166
I want to say goodbye.

614
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Properly.

615
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:21,291
Can I have a minute? Please?

616
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:48,208
We need to go.

617
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,291
I... I have to...

618
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:39,916
<i>You've reached Rob,
leave me a message after the tone.</i>

619
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,416
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

620
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,625
- You ready?
- Mm-mm.

621
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,875
Kovac is waiting.

622
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,750
Screen's broken.

623
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,958
<i>The toxicology report came back.</i>

624
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:59,500
It shows high levels
of cocaine and ketamine in Kate's system.

625
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,541
Did you know she was taking drugs?

626
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:04,458
Yes.

627
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:06,833
Why didn't you tell us?

628
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:09,291
You'd already made a judgment
about who she was.

629
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:12,583
I thought it would stop you looking
for her, and it did.

630
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:14,833
Didn't it?

631
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,250
The results of your blood work
came back too.

632
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,875
They also found traces of ketamine.

633
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:28,291
See. I... I told you I was drugged.

634
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:30,875
We interviewed
the two men you identified.

635
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,250
They deny giving you
any illegal substances.

636
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,458
Well, they would. Wouldn't they?

637
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:37,333
Well, they've got no priors.

638
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,625
And they also have alibis
for the time of the murder.

639
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,125
A taxi driver
picked them up outside your apartment.

640
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,125
Their roommate can vouch for them too.

641
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:46,333
Bad luck.

642
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:51,166
What about Jay?

643
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,500
It's Kate's ex-husband.

644
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,458
She's divorcing him. Isn't that a motive?

645
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,458
He's in London.

646
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,301
It's only a two-hour flight
from here.

647
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,541
We'll look into it.

648
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,750
We interviewed people
from the Blue Parlour,

649
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,541
and several people saw you
and Kate arguing when you left.

650
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:07,875
What? No.

651
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:09,583
That's not true.

652
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:13,083
You didn't argue with Kate then,
hours before she died?

653
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,833
<i>They're complete strangers!</i>

654
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,958
Relax! It'll be an adventure!

655
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:23,250
It wasn't an argument.

656
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:25,250
It was a conversation.

657
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,291
I thought you didn't recall anything
about that night.

658
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:29,976
- You were drugged, remember?
- No.

659
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,375
I... I passed out in the taxi,
but I remember some things.

660
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,166
Your story keeps changing.

661
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,166
What are you saying?

662
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:42,125
You think I have something
to do with Kate's murder?

663
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,541
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?

664
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,166
No.

665
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:04,500
We need your passport
until we can verify your statement.

666
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,916
If you remember anything, call me.

667
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,125
Let's hope your story checks out.

668
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:31,416
Jay, you knew.

669
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:32,916
Didn't you?

670
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,416
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

671
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:39,791
Look, I was going to,
but, uh, you were about to have a baby.

672
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:43,041
My husband
was having an affair with my best friend,

673
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,333
and you didn't think
I had the right to know.

674
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:46,458
Look, Beth...

675
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,708
How long was it going on for?

676
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:51,791
Not long.

677
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,166
Uh... a few months.

678
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,166
<i>I guess she was trying to get back at me.
Tit for Tat.</i>

679
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,250
Wow.

680
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,291
Wow.

681
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,916
You know they had a thing at Uni.

682
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,958
Yeah, yeah, a drunken one-night stand
at freshman week.

683
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,201
- What are you saying?
<i>- I'm not saying anything.</i>

684
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,333
<i>It's just, you know,</i>

685
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:12,708
maybe there
were some latent feelings on her part.

686
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,291
How could I have not seen it?

687
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:24,625
We don't see what we don't want to see.

688
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:30,583
I've been feeling so guilty for...

689
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:33,291
for being...

690
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,250
so unhappy.

691
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,291
Like I'm not grateful enough

692
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:44,500
for my life, for Aster.

693
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:48,541
I was just too ashamed

694
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:52,416
to look up and see what
was staring me in the face.

695
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:58,291
Oh my God.

696
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,791
What if she did drug me

697
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:06,916
so I would sleep with someone

698
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,666
or not know if I had or hadn't?

699
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,291
Then she could get Rob to leave me.

700
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,416
Do you think he could have killed Kate?

701
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:20,541
Rob?

702
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,958
Oh, God, no.

703
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,625
And I spoke to him over the weekend.

704
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:29,000
He was home with Aster.

705
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,291
You never wondered if it was me?

706
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:35,833
No.

707
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,041
Too trusting, right?

708
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:43,458
One thing I've learned,

709
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:45,875
never trust people,

710
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,041
only your instincts.

711
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:54,166
Where I come from,
we say <i>Alalbek Daleelek.</i>

712
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,458
Your heart is your guide.

713
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,625
Zain.

714
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:05,958
How did...

715
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,458
How did your wife die?

716
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,083
She was working in a clinic.

717
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,333
There was a bombing. Uh...

718
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,666
I was late to pick her up.

719
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,875
It's not your fault.

720
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:13,291
<i>You there? Hello? Hi?</i>

721
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:17,625
<i>Hey, um, I was putting Aster down.
Sorry, I got your message. You okay?</i>

722
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,916
I know, Rob.

723
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,333
Know? Know what?

724
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:24,541
<i>About you and Kate.</i>

725
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,750
- What about me and Kate?
- Stop!

726
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,750
Beth, what are you talking about?

727
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:33,791
That you were sleeping
with her for months.

728
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,750
Uh, what?
What you talking about?

729
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:44,500
Stop treating me like an idiot.
I found the text messages on her phone.

730
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:52,625
I... I...

731
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:54,291
<i>I...</i>

732
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,291
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

733
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,416
I...

734
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,083
It didn't mean anything.

735
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:05,416
<i>I only did it because we...
When was the last time we had sex?</i>

736
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,458
<i>- You were depressed and I...</i>
- No! You do not get to blame this on me.

737
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:13,000
- No, I'm not blam... Look, I'm sorry...
<i>- Stop apologizing!</i>

738
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:15,708
Did you love her?

739
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:18,500
Of course I didn't...

740
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,208
Look, you've just got to come home.
We can't do this over the phone.

741
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:24,458
I can't come home, Rob,

742
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:28,625
because the police have taken my passport
because I'm sure they think I killed Kate.

743
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:32,083
And if they find out about the affair,
they'll have a damn good reason too.

744
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,250
Beth, Beth, Beth, Beth.

745
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,166
- I am so sorry.
<i>- Just shut up.</i>

746
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:40,916
I just want to see Aster.

747
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:07,083
Beth Jenner, we're arresting you on
suspicion of the murder of Kate Thompson.

748
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:09,500
Put your hands behind your back.

749
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,583
What?

750
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,583
For how long have you known Mr. Zakaria?

751
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Zain?

752
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:22,458
A few days.

753
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,291
Why?

754
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,083
How did the two of you meet?

755
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,500
He drives a taxi.

756
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,708
He took me and Kate
to the bar on Friday night.

757
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:34,958
He's been helping me look for her.

758
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,809
Why didn't you tell us he was with you
when you confronted the escorts?

759
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:40,250
Or that he physically
assaulted one of them?

760
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,750
But they stole Kate's bag.

761
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:44,500
He got them to admit it.
He got the bag back.

762
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:48,083
Mr. Zakaria
is connected to organized crime.

763
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:50,541
He's a member of an Albanian gang

764
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:53,875
involved in human trafficking,
among other things.

765
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:57,541
What?

766
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:58,958
You didn't know this about him?

767
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:03,166
No. No, of course not.
What... What are you saying?

768
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,708
He killed Kate.

769
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:06,083
- No! No!
- Yes!

770
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,208
- He can't have.
- Yes. Yes.

771
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,000
And you hired him to do it.

772
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:12,916
- What?
- He's also been arrested.

773
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,416
This is insane! This is insane!

774
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,875
How do you... You can't possibly think
I had anything to do with this!

775
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:21,208
Please! Why would I want Kate dead?

776
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,750
Because she was having an affair
with your husband.

777
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:26,958
Oh.

778
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,208
You didn't think we'd find out.

779
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:31,333
I only found out yesterday.

780
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,500
Did you talk to Jay?

781
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,583
Jay has known about it for months.

782
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:41,041
We are speaking to him later today.

783
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,000
I want a lawyer.

784
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,083
Can I have a lawyer?

785
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:52,625
Just because they haven't charged you
doesn't mean they won't.

786
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,458
It is only because they don't
have enough evidence yet.

787
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:59,166
They were hoping they could press you
on your connection to Mr. Zacharia,

788
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,750
and you'd confess.

789
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:02,291
To what?

790
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:03,666
I didn't do anything.

791
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:11,500
Call me next time before you say anything
to incriminate yourself.

792
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,458
What are you doing here?

793
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,041
Your landlord let me in.

794
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,125
I needed to see you.

795
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:46,625
They told me you'd been arrested.

796
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,375
They let me go.

797
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,166
I was driving all Friday night
until Saturday morning.

798
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,041
The app tracks everything.

799
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:56,750
They said...

800
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:01,500
you have links
to an Albanian criminal gang.

801
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:05,708
You think I killed Kate?

802
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:07,375
I don't know.

803
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,500
I don't know who to believe.

804
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:19,375
I saved the life of a boy
who'd been hit with shrapnel in the leg.

805
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:22,625
His father has connections
to an Albanian people-smuggling ring.

806
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:27,625
He got me out of Aleppo,
crossed the border into Turkey then here.

807
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,375
Helped secure me a visa.

808
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,833
So you don't work for this person?

809
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,083
No.

810
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:39,708
How do I know you're telling me the truth?

811
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:43,208
Your heart is your guide.

812
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:00,833
<i>You can't possibly think
I had anything to do with this.</i>

813
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,208
<i>Why would I want Kate dead?</i>

814
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:05,083
Because she was having an affair
with your husband.

815
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:30,708
<i>So what?</i>

816
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,083
My husband was having an affair
with my best friend.

817
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,083
You didn't think I had the right to know?

818
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,416
Oh my God.

819
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:21,208
Hello.

820
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:42,500
Are you looking for something?

821
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:44,791
Oh, uh...

822
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,166
Uh, takeout menus.

823
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:48,750
I'm hungry.

824
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,083
All the menus are online.

825
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:54,166
Uh, my cell data ran out.

826
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,000
Could I get the Wi-Fi password?

827
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:02,791
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

828
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:14,041
What happened with the police?
They let you go.

829
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,333
Yeah.

830
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:21,000
And how much longer
do you think you'll be staying here?

831
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:24,791
Um, I... I don't know.

832
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:27,208
- Are you going out somewhere?
- Yes.

833
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:32,583
A screening for a movie
I supervised the music for.

834
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:36,125
Hmm.

835
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,291
Goodbye, then.

836
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,083
What?

837
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,583
Oh my Jesus Christ.

838
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,291
Oh my God.

839
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,708
You're filming everything.

840
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:56,125
Did you film Friday?

841
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,333
Come on, come on, come on.

842
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:11,041
<i>Whoa! Oh my God.</i>

843
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,601
<i>Yeah, right?</i>

844
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:15,875
<i>- Well, thanks. Are you sure?
- Yeah, no, for sure. Come on.</i>

845
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,375
<i>Fine.</i>

846
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:27,351
<i>- Here we go.
- Watch your step.</i>

847
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,208
<i>I'm watching my step.</i>

848
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:31,791
<i>Somebody's gonna have
a beautiful night of sleep.</i>

849
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:32,916
<i>Beth.</i>

850
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,833
<i>What happened to you?</i>

851
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:38,291
<i>Let's get you ready for bed. Yeah. Whoa.</i>

852
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:56,625
<i>Come on, join in.</i>

853
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:57,708
<i>Whoo!</i>

854
01:01:58,416 --> 01:01:59,416
<i>Very good.</i>

855
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
<i>Hot tub.</i>

856
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:02,750
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

857
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:04,833
<i>Hot tub on the balcony.</i>

858
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:07,333
<i>Oh yeah, strip down.</i>

859
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:11,375
<i>Whoo!</i>

860
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:19,041
<i>Don't you go anywhere.</i>

861
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:20,333
<i>Don't take too long.</i>

862
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:22,500
<i>See you, beautiful.</i>

863
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:45,500
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

864
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:47,333
<i>Bitch!</i>

865
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:54,375
<i>Ahh!</i>

866
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:32,250
Who's that with her?

867
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:57,583
- No!
- No! Stop! It's not what you think!

868
01:03:57,666 --> 01:03:59,166
It's for security!

869
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,458
People have parties!

870
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:03,208
You're taping people
in the shower having sex!

871
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,791
And you knew what happened to Kate
this whole time.

872
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,416
You could have told the police.

873
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,250
You told them
about my husband's affair, didn't you?

874
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,500
What are you doing?

875
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:14,208
What is that? No. Don't delete them.

876
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:15,708
It's evidence! No!

877
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:17,916
Stop!

878
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,875
Oh gosh.

879
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:46,458
Oh!

880
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:55,583
Help!

881
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,208
Beth.

882
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,625
Oh.

883
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:01,458
- Wait!
- Let's go.

884
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:02,708
What happened?

885
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:06,750
Stop, you don't understand!
Stop. I can explain.

886
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,392
Go! Now! Go!

887
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:10,375
Beth! Come back! Come back!

888
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:12,458
He... He deleted all the videos.

889
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:15,250
He's gonna tell the police I attacked him.

890
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,083
Oh my God, this is a nightmare.

891
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:20,083
Listen.

892
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,750
We'll find out where Kate went,

893
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:24,125
then we can hopefully find out
who brought her home.

894
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:27,333
Then we can go to the police.
We will explain. It will be okay.

895
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:28,416
Trust me.

896
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:39,583
I gave him the license number.

897
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,750
Driver is on his way.

898
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:44,333
Did I hurt you?

899
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,041
You hurt your hand?

900
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,125
A little.

901
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:52,375
Throat, balls, eyes.

902
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,125
Soft targets.

903
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:57,041
Okay, I'll remember that for next time.

904
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,541
What does that mean?

905
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,958
They say you're a suspect
in Kate's murder.

906
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:10,875
You speak English?

907
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:11,958
Very little.

908
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:17,166
You picked up a woman
early Saturday morning around 3:00.

909
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,083
- She's my height, blonde hair.
- On Jerina Street.

910
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,083
She's dead.

911
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:25,916
She was murdered.

912
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:28,875
Where did you take her?

913
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:32,750
We just need
to know where you took her. That's all.

914
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,875
She made me follow these two men.
She said they stole her bag.

915
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:38,875
I lost them on a one-way street.

916
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:41,000
What's he saying?
Where'd you take her?

917
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,250
Where?

918
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,000
The police station.

919
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,041
Thank you.

920
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:57,083
If Kate reported her bag stolen,

921
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:59,517
why wasn't there a record of it
when I reported her missing?

922
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:00,916
Maybe it never got filed.

923
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,083
Pavic didn't file my report either.

924
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,000
We need to get out of here.

925
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,125
Come on!

926
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,166
Beth! Don't leave!
We just want to talk.

927
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,791
Stop!

928
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:38,666
Beth!

929
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,708
Stop! Right now!

930
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:55,208
Stop it!

931
01:07:58,416 --> 01:07:59,416
Come on.

932
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:06,458
Stop!

933
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:12,708
His car.

934
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:14,333
The cop's car.

935
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:17,333
I saw the sticker in the security footage.

936
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:20,291
He must've driven Kate home
after she reported her bag stolen.

937
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:22,083
Why didn't he say anything?

938
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:26,750
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

939
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:31,458
It was him. It was him.

940
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:33,291
It was Pavic.

941
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:35,750
Call your lawyer.

942
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,083
- Make her meet you.
- Wait. Where are you going?

943
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:40,166
- Don't worry about me.
- No.

944
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,333
You'll get in trouble.

945
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,458
Go! Go! Go!

946
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:56,453
It's him!

947
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:58,676
Believe me it's him.
It's the cop who did it.

948
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:01,184
- What're you talking about?
- We saw the footage.

949
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:02,375
What do you mean?

950
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:18,083
Where did she go?

951
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:39,458
Stop!

952
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:41,750
You're under arrest.

953
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:43,000
It was you.

954
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:45,541
You killed her.

955
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:46,625
What?

956
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,083
You hit on her, didn't you?

957
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,250
Shut up.

958
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,500
My God, you did!
You hit on her, and she rejected you!

959
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:54,416
She was a slut!

960
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,791
That's what men call women
who won't sleep with them!

961
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:59,041
- Shut your mouth! Shut up!
- No! No!

962
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,708
Shut your mouth!

963
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,708
Pavic, stop! Stop it!

964
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:39,833
Hi.

965
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:42,000
Sorry for the wait.

966
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:44,541
How are you feeling?

967
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,666
We found security footage.

968
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,333
A camera on the boardwalk.

969
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:55,750
And we recovered
some of your landlord's footage.

970
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,625
I'm so sorry I doubted you.
You were right.

971
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:03,125
Pavic drove Kate home
after she reported her bag stolen.

972
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:06,083
We think he did make a pass at her.

973
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,833
When she rejected him,

974
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:10,791
he took it badly.

975
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:17,833
So he... he killed her.

976
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:24,250
Based on the autopsy results,

977
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:29,583
we can safely assume
Pavic hit her over the back of the head,

978
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,416
and then dumped her body in the harbor

979
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,875
while she was still alive.

980
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:38,375
Why?

981
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,375
I...

982
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:43,875
I... I don't understand.

983
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:46,708
Pavic used to work vice.

984
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:50,041
Several women

985
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:54,208
he arrested for sex work
claimed he assaulted them.

986
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,166
Internal Affairs investigated it,

987
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,750
but the women
all withdrew their statements.

988
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:04,208
We think he threatened them.

989
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:05,541
IA couldn't fire him,

990
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:09,500
so unfortunately, they moved him over
to the tourist division.

991
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,625
She didn't deserve this.

992
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,041
No.

993
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,583
I...

994
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,583
I ordered a search warrant

995
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:24,458
on Luka and Mateo's apartment
and workplace too.

996
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:26,458
We found ketamine.

997
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:29,791
They've been drugging the women
who hired them then robbing them.

998
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:31,958
They drugged Kate too,

999
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,833
but the cocaine
in her system counteracted it.

1000
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,541
We are charging them.

1001
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,500
So I'm free to go then.

1002
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:44,666
Wait a second.

1003
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:58,666
In case you want
to press charges against your landlord.

1004
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,666
Are you okay?

1005
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,458
Thank you.

1006
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:31,708
Sorry, it's...

1007
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:33,541
a bit of a mess.

1008
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:38,291
Uh, I just put the kettle on.
Do you want to stay for a cuppa?

1009
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,083
I'm good.

1010
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:44,166
Uh, I packed clothes
and Ernie the sheep in the bag.

1011
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,750
I... I didn't bring diapers.

1012
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,250
I figured you had those.

1013
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:51,583
I can pop out and get some. No worries.

1014
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:52,666
Okay.

1015
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:57,375
Hey, there's this kids' art thing
at the park tomorrow.

1016
01:14:57,458 --> 01:15:00,166
I was thinking
of taking Aster if you fancy joining us.

1017
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:04,500
Maybe we could have lunch after
at Georgio's, the three of us.

1018
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,041
Please.

1019
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:13,875
Beth.

1020
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,458
Uh...

1021
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,791
You know, uh, I think you might
have my spare car key.

1022
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:40,708
Yeah, it's probably
in the bowl in the hallway

1023
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:41,958
or in my jacket.

1024
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,083
Oh!

1025
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,625
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1026
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:16,875
I... I got it online.

1027
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:18,208
I can send it back.

1028
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,000
You all right?

1029
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,250
You find the key?

1030
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:36,791
Uh...

1031
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,333
Can I use your bathroom?

1032
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,083
Sure.

1033
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,000
Oh my... Oh my God.

1034
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,208
<i>Kovac.</i>

1035
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:39,583
It's me.

1036
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:41,500
<i>Beth.</i>

1037
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,333
What's wrong?

1038
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,958
It wasn't Pavic, it was...

1039
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:49,416
Beth.

1040
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,375
Uh...

1041
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:55,166
Just a minute.

1042
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:21,666
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1043
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:25,416
I can't find Ernie the sheep.

1044
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,750
Where did you say it was?

1045
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,041
Oh. Uh...

1046
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:32,625
It's... It's in the bag. I'll... I'll get it.

1047
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,166
I'm gonna stay for that cup of tea.

1048
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,708
If that's, uh, still up for offer.

1049
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:39,916
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1050
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:42,458
Cool? Okay.

1051
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,541
- Right here.
- Oh. Thanks.

1052
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,333
Sorry.

1053
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:05,833
Suppose you've got a lot to do
before you start work on Monday.

1054
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:07,791
Did you get the child-minding sorted?

1055
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,666
You're looking at me strangely. Do you...

1056
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,833
want more milk or...

1057
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,291
You killed Kate.

1058
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,583
- What?
- It wasn't Pavic.

1059
01:19:25,166 --> 01:19:26,166
It was you.

1060
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:29,833
Is this some kind of joke?

1061
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:32,500
You flew in Friday night.

1062
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:36,291
- It's only two hours...
- It's insane.

1063
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:39,375
You flew back Saturday morning.
Won't be hard to check the flights.

1064
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,625
Beth, come on. You can't be serious.

1065
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:48,416
It's from her necklace,
and I found it in your jacket.

1066
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:06,666
Listen.

1067
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:10,375
I can explain. It was an accident.

1068
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:11,458
Oh my God.

1069
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:14,958
- What did you do?
- Stop. Wait. Listen to me. Listen to me.

1070
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I flew over.

1071
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,791
And I was waiting outside the apartment.

1072
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:24,166
I'd been calling and texting.
She wasn't picking up. I thought...

1073
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,708
I was terrified she told you.

1074
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:30,041
She kept threatening to. I thought
if she had, I could at least talk to you.

1075
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,125
Explain things.

1076
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,166
I was about to leave,
but then she showed up.

1077
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:37,416
Kate.

1078
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,333
Jesus. What the hell are you doing here?

1079
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:42,333
I needed to see you.

1080
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,291
You know this makes you a stalker.

1081
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:46,535
I didn't have a choice.
You wouldn't answer your phone.

1082
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,125
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

1083
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:54,416
Went for a walk.

1084
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:58,166
We ended up down by the water,
and we talked.

1085
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,291
Kate.

1086
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:00,375
What?

1087
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,208
Have you told her?

1088
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
You going to?

1089
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:11,125
You're gonna ruin her life.
You wanna do that? I don't.

1090
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,500
Not unless...

1091
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,666
we're doing this. You and me.

1092
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,333
For God's sake, Rob.

1093
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,250
How many times? It meant nothing.

1094
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:24,125
How can you say it meant nothing?

1095
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:27,083
Why were we doing it if it meant nothing?

1096
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:30,250
Yeah. Yeah.

1097
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,791
I know. You have feelings for me.

1098
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,416
She told me...
She told me she was in love with me.

1099
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,041
She, she, she... She kept begging me.

1100
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:42,916
She was begging me to leave you.

1101
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:46,267
She said you were unhappy. I'd be
doing you a favor breaking up with you.

1102
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:49,250
I told her, I don't know how many times,
that was never gonna happen.

1103
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:50,333
Stop.

1104
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,833
What happened between us was a mistake.

1105
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,625
It was the biggest mistake of my life?

1106
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:00,750
It wasn't.

1107
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,375
It was a rebound fling, and you...

1108
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:06,750
...were in the right place
at the right time.

1109
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:09,208
- That's all.
- You're lying.

1110
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:13,875
Actually, from now on,
I'm only telling the truth.

1111
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:18,500
- Maybe you should try it too.
- Please, please, Kate, please.

1112
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:20,625
- Don't tell her.
- Get off me.

1113
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:21,791
Kate, come here.

1114
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:25,708
Listen.

1115
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:27,916
- Stop it! Get off me!
- No, stop, listen to me!

1116
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I was angry.

1117
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:30,625
I lashed out.

1118
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:35,416
I hit her.

1119
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,583
Will you please...

1120
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,458
It just happened.

1121
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:41,625
She tripped and fell and banged her head.

1122
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,375
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1123
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:00,708
<i>No.</i>

1124
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,458
You let her drown.

1125
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:06,416
No. No, I... I thought she was dead.

1126
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,351
- No, you didn't.
- That's why I left her.

1127
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:11,083
You're lying.
I saw the autopsy report. She drowned.

1128
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:13,726
- She was alive in the water when you left.
- I'm telling the truth.

1129
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,750
- You have to listen.
- No, I don't have to listen!

1130
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:19,000
I will never listen to you again.
I should've listened to Kate.

1131
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,666
That's what the weekend was about.

1132
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:24,750
She wanted to remind me
who I was before I met you.

1133
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:26,833
That I deserve better.

1134
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:31,208
- What are you gonna do now, huh?
- You killed my best friend.

1135
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,041
You're not gonna tell the police, are you?

1136
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:36,958
What would be the point?
The case's closed. That cop's dead.

1137
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:39,875
What good is me going to jail? Beth?

1138
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:42,541
Please, I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

1139
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:44,708
Please, think about Aster.

1140
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:47,375
You want her to grow up without a dad?

1141
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:50,166
Her dad's a murderer.

1142
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:52,958
Come on, you know I'm not.

1143
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,166
No. You are not calling the police.

1144
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:57,208
I already have.

1145
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:02,083
<i>Beth, are you there?</i>

1146
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:04,791
I got it all.
The police are on their way. Beth?

1147
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,208
Ow. Ow.

1148
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,125
Let go.

1149
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:09,958
Let go of me.

1150
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:12,250
Get your hands off me.

1151
01:24:16,916 --> 01:24:20,208
It's okay. Mama's got you.
Mama's got you.
