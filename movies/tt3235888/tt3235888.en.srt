00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,159
Are you okay?

3
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,830
Yeah.

4
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,065
You need some help.

5
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:27,553
No.

6
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:37,885
<i>Annie. What are you doing?</i>

7
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,184
I am fine, dad.

8
00:01:58,163 --> 00:01:59,634
What is the matter?

9
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:00,908
What is going on?

10
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:08,839
Annie?

11
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:07,740
Dad?

12
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:11,588
I love you.

13
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:14,017
I know.

14
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:15,320
I know.

15
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:18,612
I just want you and mom to know
how much I love you.

16
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,099
Dad. I am sorry that I can be
such a shit to you sometimes.

17
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,273
I do not know why I do that.

18
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:37,850
Just know that I love you. Okay.

19
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,279
I just really love you both.

20
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,045
Hey, Jay.

21
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,013
What is up?

22
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:22,110
Nothing. How long you
and Yara are out here?

23
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,359
We are going to watch a movie.
See if you like it.

24
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:26,729
Actually, I am going out tonight.

25
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:28,706
That person?

26
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:32,019
I like him.

27
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:35,406
I am too.

28
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:56,720
I see you.

29
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,757
What are you reading?

30
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,417
The idiot (Fyodor Dostoyevsky).

31
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:56,722
Is it any good?

32
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:58,626
I do not know yet.

33
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:00,405
It is about Paul.

34
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,022
Hey, Jay.

35
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,391
Hey, Paul.

36
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:11,211
Stop.

37
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,008
I have an idea.

38
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,627
What?

39
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:19,681
It got away.

40
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,881
You ever played the 'Trade' game.

41
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:52,295
No. What is that?

42
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:53,936
It is people watching game.

43
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:56,412
My sister and I used to play
When we were bored.

44
00:08:56,857 --> 00:08:58,468
You are bored right now.

45
00:08:58,627 --> 00:08:59,830
No. Shut up.

46
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,284
Let me finish.

47
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:03,565
Okay, how do you play it?

48
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:06,380
You start by watching the crowd.

49
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:09,787
Casually just, go by the people
around you.

50
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:11,918
Okay.

51
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,997
Now, without telling me.

52
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:16,820
Pick a person you want to
trade places.

53
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:19,991
It can be anyone,
for whatever reason.

54
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,287
Okay. I got it.

55
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:29,954
Now, I get two guesses to
figure out.

56
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:33,289
Whom you pick. In addition, why you
want to trade places with them.

57
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,815
Okay. Good luck.

58
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:43,764
That person.

59
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:47,844
No.

60
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,394
Okay then. Whom you picked.

61
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:53,568
Him.

62
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,379
The dad?

63
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,866
No. The son.

64
00:09:57,946 --> 00:10:00,506
I mean how cool that will be. Like
you, whole life is out of you.

65
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,277
You know.

66
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,389
Come on!

67
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:04,555
It is not as you are old.
You are 21

68
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:07,109
I know, but...

69
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:10,479
Look how happy that kid is.

70
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:13,984
At that age you could go to the
bathroom anything time you want.

71
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,202
Total freedom.

72
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:16,227
Yeah.

73
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,786
Splashing his shirt right now.

74
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:21,333
Yeah, exactly. I can never
get away with that.

75
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:27,557
Okay. My turn.

76
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:30,694
Okay.

77
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:40,773
Okay. Got it.

78
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,687
How about the girl in
the yellow dress?

79
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,345
Where?

80
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:01,018
Right there.

81
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,539
I do not see her.

82
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,102
Right there.

83
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:10,983
Are you teasing me?

84
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:14,476
I am sorry, I just... I do not.

85
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:15,726
Can we go?

86
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:17,560
I am sorry. I just have to go.

87
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:18,088
If you...

88
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:19,814
Can we go back into the car?

89
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,976
Is there someone in there
that made you want to leave.

90
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:26,313
Like an ex-girlfriend
or something?

91
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:28,427
You said you saw a
girl in yellow dress.

92
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:30,311
Is that someone that you knew?

93
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:33,936
No. I just felt sick.
I feel better being outside.

94
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,271
Thanks for walking with me.

95
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,658
Mom knows you smoke.

96
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:31,014
Yeah. But, she will crazy if
she actually sees it happening.

97
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:33,512
Or she will just steal your
cigarettes.

98
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:36,753
How is it going with you?

99
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:39,810
Good.

100
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:41,496
Honestly.

101
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,401
I do not know. He was acting
kind of weird last night.

102
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:46,666
Why?

103
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,165
He said he was not feeling
well however.

104
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,256
Something else was on his mind.

105
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,925
Have you.

106
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:57,506
No.

107
00:12:57,531 --> 00:12:58,431
No.

108
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,443
I know he wants to, but...

109
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,226
I do not know.
He seemed different last night.

110
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:12,529
Do you smell that?

111
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:17,062
Like. Cherry coke,
bananas, nicotine.

112
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,569
That is my favorite flavor.

113
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:20,192
I love it.

114
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:49,180
Let us go back to the car.

115
00:16:17,064 --> 00:16:18,353
That is funny.

116
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,512
I used to day dream about
being old enough to go on dates.

117
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:25,177
Driving around with my friends
in their cars.

118
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:29,530
I had this image of myself.

119
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:32,996
Holding hands with a
cute person.

120
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:36,164
Listening to the radio.

121
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,917
Driving along some pretty road.

122
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:41,443
Up north maybe.

123
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:44,625
In addition, the trees start to
change colors.

124
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:52,294
It is never about going
anywhere really.

125
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,842
Some sort of freedom I guess.

126
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:03,793
Never old enough,
the hell do we go.

127
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,209
Jay?

128
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:21,890
Are you awake?

129
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,312
I am sorry.

130
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:31,905
What are you doing?

131
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,813
I am not going to hurt you.

132
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:41,870
Do not worry.

133
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:50,693
You are not going to believe me.

134
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:54,164
However, I need you to remember
what I am saying.

135
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:56,994
Okay.

136
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,294
This thing.

137
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:08,752
It is going to follow you.

138
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,029
Somebody gave it to me.

139
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:19,275
In addition, I pass it to you.

140
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:21,988
Back in the car.

141
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,989
It could look like
someone you know.

142
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,532
Or it could be a
stranger in a crowd.

143
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:33,209
Whatever helps it
get close to you.

144
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,846
He could look like anyone.

145
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:40,072
However, there is only one of it.

146
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,823
Help.

147
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:48,736
Help!

148
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:50,474
In addition, sometimes.

149
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,597
Sometimes I think it looks like.

150
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:56,495
People you love.
Just to hurt you.

151
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,982
I see it.

152
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,311
I see it.

153
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,408
No.

154
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:40,392
Who is it?

155
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:56,225
You get rid of it, okay.

156
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,559
Just sleep with someone
as soon as you can.

157
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,193
Just pass it along.

158
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:02,378
If it kills you.
It will come after me.

159
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:03,992
Do you understand?

160
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,507
What the fuck do you want?

161
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:18,830
Jay. I am doing this to help you.

162
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:21,454
Just to let you know, it is real.

163
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:32,435
Help!

164
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:34,166
Help me.

165
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,066
Never go into a place that
does not have more than one exit.

166
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:53,081
It is very slow.
However, it is not dumb.

167
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:10,454
Can I have some?

168
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:11,891
Yeah.

169
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,959
Listen to this,

170
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:21,777
<i>I think that if one face by
inevitable destruction.</i>

171
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:24,230
<i>If a house is falling upon you,
for instance.</i>

172
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:27,505
<i>One must feel a great longing
to sit down,</i>

173
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:29,751
<i>close one eyes and wait.</i>

174
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:32,305
<i>What may. ( Fyodor
Dostoyevsky: "The Idiot”)</i>

175
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:34,554
That is why we are drinking
on the porch.

176
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:38,810
Are you mom asleep already?

177
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:41,161
Almost for sure.

178
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:43,451
She wakes up at 5.15.

179
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,230
That would kill me.

180
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,360
So.

181
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:47,962
Where is Jay?

182
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,769
On a date.

183
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,383
Your turn.

184
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:56,065
Who is he?

185
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,105
Somebody new.

186
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,733
Of course!

187
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,986
Your sister is so pretty.
It is annoying.

188
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:03,207
It is annoying.

189
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:04,788
Anyway, she is nice.

190
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:22,562
Is everything okay?

191
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:33,050
Do not let it touch you.

192
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:52,704
Jay!

193
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,076
What happened?

194
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,931
I do not know.

195
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:25,934
Those people are such a mess.

196
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,679
It was consensual.

197
00:24:37,494 --> 00:24:38,720
Yeah.

198
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:42,838
And, you never see the
woman before?

199
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,574
No.

200
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,032
Okay.

201
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:50,967
Have you ever been to his home?

202
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:56,378
I know where he lives, but...

203
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:59,228
I never went inside.

204
00:25:01,473 --> 00:25:03,716
He said he was embarrassed
where he lived.

205
00:25:53,827 --> 00:25:55,531
Did she catch anything?

206
00:25:57,243 --> 00:25:58,792
I do not think so.

207
00:25:59,663 --> 00:26:01,547
Poor Jamie.

208
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:07,112
Apparently, he used a fake name
to rent a house in the city.

209
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:09,536
The police searched the place,
they cannot find him.

210
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:11,165
My God!

211
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:13,823
Breaks my heart the things
he said to her.

212
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:15,951
Some weird, sick.

213
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:23,577
<i>"I should have been a
pair of ragged claws</i>

214
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:27,464
<i>scuttling across floors

215
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:32,998
<i>And the afternoon, the evening,
sleeps so peacefully.</i>

216
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,592
<i>Smoothed by long fingers,</i>

217
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:41,042
<i>Asleep, tired or it malingers.</i>

218
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,177
<i>Stretched out on the floor,
here beside you and me.</i>

219
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:50,297
<i>Should I, after tea and
cakes and ices.</i>

220
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:54,728
<i>Have the strength to force
the moment to its crisis.</i>

221
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,850
<i>But though I have wept
and fasted,</i>

222
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:00,208
<i>wept and prayed,</i>

223
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:04,459
<i>Though I have seen my head
(grown slightly bald),</i>

<i>I am no prophet
and here is no great matter.</i>

226
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:14,029
<i>I have seen the moment
of my greatness flicker,</i>

227
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,588
<i>and I have seen the eternal

230
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:27,583
<i>And would it have been worth it,
after all.</i>

231
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:32,016
<i>After the cups, the marmalade,
the tea,</i>

232
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:36,777
<i>Among the porcelain,
among some talk of you and me.</i>

233
00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:38,632
<i>Would it have been worthwhile.</i>

234
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:41,713
<i>To have bitten off the matter
with a smile.</i>

235
00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:44,716
<i>To have squeezed the universe
into a ball.</i>

236
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:48,198
<i>To roll it toward some
overwhelming question.</i>

237
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:52,671
<i>Told: “I am Lazarus,
come from the dead.</i>

238
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:57,004
<i>Come back to tell you all,
I shall tell you all”.</i>

239
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:00,417
<i>If one, settling a pillow
by her head.</i>

240
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:04,324
<i>Should tell: “That is not
what I meant at all;</i>

241
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:06,841
<i>That is not it, at all.”</i>

242
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,604
Excuse me.

243
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,399
Excuse me?

244
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:40,370
Hello?

245
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:42,888
Hello.

246
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:44,710
There is an old woman at
school today.

247
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,405
In addition, she is staring at me.

248
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:50,831
It was as if she was following me.

249
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,449
Did you know her?

250
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:55,761
No. But she freaked me out.

251
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,011
I did not go back to class.

252
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:02,049
Did she say something to you?

253
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:08,272
Hugh told me that.

254
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:10,588
He passed it on to me.

255
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:14,520
He said it was going to follow me.

256
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:17,617
That is all bullshit, Jay.

257
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,338
Yeah, I know.

258
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:26,872
What exactly is suppose to be
following you.

259
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:30,188
I do not know.

260
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:32,913
You should tell mom what you saw.

261
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:34,184
No.

262
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:36,625
Jay. I am worried about you.

263
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:40,671
I could. Stay over tonight,
If to make you feel any better.

264
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:41,849
- No.
- No.

265
00:31:41,874 --> 00:31:43,205
Sleep on the couch or something.

266
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,302
No.

267
00:31:46,545 --> 00:31:48,097
Maybe just on the couch.

268
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,842
You should be more worry about waking
up and finding Paul humping you leg.

269
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,973
Yes.

270
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:56,897
I choosing to ignore all these
insults to my character.

271
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,917
Just, keep your door locked.

272
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,774
Look.

273
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:06,008
I am going to stay up all night. And
keep an eye out for anything weird.

274
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:09,009
Nothing is going to happen.
Okay.

275
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:45,216
I cannot sleep.

276
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:46,798
Not in there.

277
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,438
That is okay.

278
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,255
Just sleep here.

279
00:34:24,756 --> 00:34:26,130
Are you okay?

280
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,228
Everything is going to be cool.

281
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,360
That is funny.

282
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:40,814
I have not spent a night over here
since we were kids.

283
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:47,004
There is a reason for that.

284
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,296
Shut up.

285
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,868
I am serious.

286
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:54,685
It is cool spending time with you.

287
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,060
Yeah.

288
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,949
You are my first kiss.

289
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:16,941
I know.

290
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:20,054
Is that not yours?

291
00:35:21,606 --> 00:35:22,886
No.

292
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,455
You were.

293
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,954
Then you kissed Kelly.

294
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:32,885
She told me.

295
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:36,726
You kiss your sisters,
that is somewhat gross.

296
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:42,069
Do you remember?

297
00:35:42,094 --> 00:35:43,243
The time.

298
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:46,740
That we found those
porno magazines.

299
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,788
In the alley by Barry's pizza?

300
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,086
Yeah.

301
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,541
We are such stupid kids.

302
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:53,640
Ridiculous.

303
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:57,149
We are all sitting out on
Greg's front lawn.

304
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:58,989
With a dozen, dirty magazines.

305
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:02,001
Just sprawled out everywhere.
In addition, we were laughing.

306
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,446
And we did not realized
how bad it was.

307
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,669
Greg's mom.

308
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:10,212
Remember her face when she came
out. Saw us reading that shit.

309
00:36:10,488 --> 00:36:12,875
She scooped them up so fast.

310
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:14,787
Then she called my mom.

311
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,520
Kel and I got the sex and talk
the next day.

312
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:19,224
I got one too.

313
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:21,212
What the fuck?

314
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:22,450
Go look.

315
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:41,688
There is a broken window in
the kitchen. However.

316
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,203
There is no one there.

317
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:44,239
Are you sure?

318
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:47,115
Yeah. I mean whoever broke it
must have run away.

319
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,600
Maybe we should call the police.

320
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,835
I am going to wake up your sister.
She should call.

321
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,568
Jay?

322
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:01,199
<i>Jay? Can you open the door?</i>

323
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:02,847
It is in the house.

324
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:04,003
<i>What is going on?</i>

325
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:05,649
<i>There is nothing in the house,
Jay.</i>

326
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,295
I saw it.

327
00:39:10,678 --> 00:39:12,397
<i>Open the door. Okay.</i>

328
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:13,795
It is in the kitchen.

329
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:15,663
<i>I am not going to let anything
happen to you.</i>

330
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,874
<i>Open the door, in addition,
we will figure this out.</i>

331
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,715
There is nothing out here.

332
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:41,232
Jay?

333
00:39:47,064 --> 00:39:48,760
Jay. Why do not you sit down?

334
00:39:50,507 --> 00:39:52,026
I need water.

335
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:53,875
God! I have to need water.

336
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:55,406
Okay. I will get you some.

337
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:56,824
No. Stay here!

338
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:05,696
Is something wrong with me?

339
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:09,348
Look. Somebody broke the window,

340
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,583
That really happened.

341
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,487
However, I saw a
girl in the kitchen.

342
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,112
Jay.

343
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:17,250
I love you.

344
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,003
You are okay.

345
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:21,328
You do not believe me.

346
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:24,167
Mom?

347
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:43,596
Mom is that you?

348
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,358
<i>No. It is me.</i>

349
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:46,687
Yara?

350
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:47,953
<i>Yeah.</i>

351
00:40:48,297 --> 00:40:49,800
Do not open the door.

352
00:40:53,393 --> 00:40:55,534
See. Everything is okay.

353
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:00,484
God!

354
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:01,583
Wait.

355
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:03,924
Jay.

356
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:05,238
What are you doing?

357
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:24,136
Jay. Wait!

358
00:41:26,722 --> 00:41:27,774
Jay!

359
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,093
Jay!

360
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,948
You could have hurt yourself.

361
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:13,370
What are you doing?

362
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:19,663
I am scared.

363
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:22,134
I am too.

364
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:23,673
We will figure it out.

365
00:43:23,698 --> 00:43:25,678
You cannot tell mom.

366
00:43:26,768 --> 00:43:29,410
She will freak out.
Moreover, she will not believe me.

367
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:31,804
I know. It is okay.

368
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:34,457
What from are you running?

369
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:39,413
Do you see that?

370
00:43:40,843 --> 00:43:41,888
I do.

371
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,438
It is a person.

372
00:43:45,778 --> 00:43:46,778
Greg?

373
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:49,097
What is going on? You are okay.

374
00:43:49,205 --> 00:43:51,092
Someone broke into
his or her house.

375
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:52,440
Shit.

376
00:43:52,616 --> 00:43:54,489
Did you call the police?

377
00:43:56,061 --> 00:43:57,613
I do not want to go home.

378
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:59,295
Where you want to go?

379
00:44:03,386 --> 00:44:05,669
I need to find him.

380
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:07,767
The person who broke into
your house?

381
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,720
No.

382
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:12,646
Hugh?

383
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:18,174
What did he really do to you?

384
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,162
Okay.

385
00:44:26,473 --> 00:44:27,977
Are you leaving?

386
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,552
No. I am getting my car.

387
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:32,438
Someone has to drive. Right?

388
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:15,988
God!

389
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:54,450
Come on see this.

390
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:00,445
What?

391
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:02,691
Is this Sue?

392
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:06,724
You recognize the jacket.

393
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:09,564
High school Olsen.

394
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:12,860
Somebody has to know
his real name.

395
00:49:14,512 --> 00:49:17,425
<i>Hello students. It is time for
you afternoon announcements.</i>

396
00:49:17,484 --> 00:49:21,019
<i>Attention all girls interested in

397
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:26,466
<i>There will be an informational meeting held
in the LT-431, right after school today.</i>

398
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:28,506

399
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:31,966
<i>Please hand in your permission
forms to Mr.Dwigans today.</i>

400
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:36,109
<i>Also your banquet this Sunday

401
00:49:36,134 --> 00:49:38,653
<i>It is time again for the
high school musical.</i>

402
00:49:38,678 --> 00:49:40,290

405
00:49:47,247 --> 00:49:50,851
<i>Tickets will be $5 for students,

406
00:49:50,876 --> 00:49:54,643
<i>Hope you all have a great weekend.
I will see you here on Monday.</i>

407
00:50:53,544 --> 00:50:55,660
- Do they know?
- Yup.

408
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,408
Real name is Jeff.

409
00:50:57,449 --> 00:50:58,463
Not Hugh?

410
00:50:58,507 --> 00:50:59,982
Jeff Friedman.

411
00:51:00,064 --> 00:51:01,892
Do we tell the police?

412
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:05,947
No.

413
00:51:50,872 --> 00:51:52,084
Hello?

414
00:51:53,747 --> 00:51:57,351
Hi. Is Jeff here?

415
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:00,821
Yeah. He is.
You want to come in.

416
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:04,320
Yeah.

417
00:52:05,535 --> 00:52:06,999
Your friends?

418
00:52:14,183 --> 00:52:16,108
Even though it is following you.

419
00:52:16,902 --> 00:52:18,572
I can still see it.

420
00:52:19,362 --> 00:52:21,356
It has not done with me either.
Okay.

421
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,828
Like I told you.

422
00:52:23,262 --> 00:52:25,745
All you can do is pass it on
to someone else.

423
00:52:26,874 --> 00:52:28,554
What about the fuck are
you talking?

424
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,845
She can do the same thing I did.

425
00:52:31,202 --> 00:52:33,390
It should be easier for her,
she is a girl.

426
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:34,931
Any person would be with you.

427
00:52:34,936 --> 00:52:37,416
Just sleep with someone else and
tell him to do the same thing.

428
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,741
Maybe it will never come back.

429
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,887
This is not real.

430
00:52:39,912 --> 00:52:42,493
I swear to you.
This is just some fuck up game.

431
00:52:43,642 --> 00:52:46,438
Look. I am not safe either. Okay.

432
00:52:47,052 --> 00:52:50,932
We should not even be in the same place. I am
sorry. Your people need to get out of here.

433
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,429
Watch it.

434
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,162
If it kills her. It gets me.

435
00:52:55,193 --> 00:52:58,111
It goes straight down the line,
whoever started it.

436
00:52:59,098 --> 00:53:00,376
Jay.

437
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:02,708
I am sorry.

438
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,621
I was not trying to hurt you.

439
00:53:04,646 --> 00:53:07,124
Someone did this to me too.

440
00:53:07,808 --> 00:53:09,755
Who did this to you?

441
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:12,516
I met a girl at the bar.

442
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:15,713
It is a one-night stand.
I do not even remember her name.

443
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:18,742
I think that is
where it came from.

444
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,398
Jeff. I do not believe you.

445
00:53:23,026 --> 00:53:24,244
She might.

446
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,800
However, I think you
are a fucking liar.

447
00:53:27,824 --> 00:53:29,723
Do you people see that girl
right there?

448
00:53:32,385 --> 00:53:33,948
- Yeah.
- Yes.

449
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:35,362
Yeah.

450
00:53:36,303 --> 00:53:37,521
Okay.

451
00:53:38,536 --> 00:53:40,039
Okay. Good.

452
00:53:41,272 --> 00:53:43,715
Jay. Listen.

453
00:53:43,741 --> 00:53:45,437
Wherever you are.

454
00:53:45,574 --> 00:53:48,327
If someone walking
straight towards you.

455
00:53:48,503 --> 00:53:50,269
However, it is walking.

456
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:54,008
If you try falling, off. You could
buy yourself some time. I think.

457
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:56,875
Decide if you want to give
to someone else.

458
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:10,637
Greg?

459
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,244
Yeah.

460
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:16,157
Your mom is not going
to freak out?

461
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:19,174
She will not even know.

462
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:24,750
It is nice of you.

463
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,544
I love coming up here.

464
00:54:29,129 --> 00:54:30,895
My dad. He...

465
00:54:31,163 --> 00:54:33,800
He used to take me hunting
a couple of times a year.

466
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:37,492
It is not like super nice, but..

467
00:54:38,177 --> 00:54:39,612
It is cool.

468
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:52,225
Have you thought about what
he said.

469
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:54,444
What?

470
00:54:56,902 --> 00:54:59,004
Maybe passing it on?

471
00:55:02,306 --> 00:55:03,767
I do not know.

472
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,977
Still like sticking around when
everyone is going home.

473
00:57:34,115 --> 00:57:35,697
It has been lonely.

474
00:57:39,861 --> 00:57:41,945
I am right across the street
you know.

475
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:44,492
I remember.

476
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,980
I guess I should have
been nicer to you.

477
00:59:05,998 --> 00:59:07,998
You people should get
into the water.

478
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:13,641
You want to come in.

479
00:59:14,087 --> 00:59:15,574
Maybe a little bit.

480
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:17,681
Come on!

481
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,956
My God! Help me.

482
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:27,519
Jay. What is it?

483
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:28,982
Please help!

484
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:31,951
Help me!

485
01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:02,678
What are you doing?

486
01:00:12,162 --> 01:00:13,694
Jay. Please!

487
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,905
Stop shooting!

488
01:00:52,961 --> 01:00:55,242
- What are you people doing?
- Do not open the door.

489
01:00:55,243 --> 01:00:56,620
- What did you do to the door?
- We did not do that.

490
01:00:56,645 --> 01:00:57,994
It is trying to come in.

491
01:00:58,019 --> 01:00:59,318
There is nothing out here.

492
01:00:59,343 --> 01:01:00,475
Yes. There is.

493
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,951
Fucking son of a...

494
01:01:05,716 --> 01:01:06,951
Greg?

495
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,177
Greg. Are you okay?

496
01:01:27,278 --> 01:01:28,381
Greg?

497
01:01:36,581 --> 01:01:38,563
Jay. What do you see?

498
01:02:08,168 --> 01:02:10,048
Wait! Jay. Come back!

499
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,172
Let my fucking car!

500
01:07:13,755 --> 01:07:15,552
Have you seen it?

501
01:07:16,353 --> 01:07:17,769
Nothing.

502
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:22,467
I am waiting, looking.

503
01:07:23,143 --> 01:07:26,030
It has been 3 days.
I do not think it is coming.

504
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:28,592
You believe me. Right?

505
01:07:29,222 --> 01:07:31,010
Not just playing along.

506
01:07:31,217 --> 01:07:33,953
No, I believe you. I just...

507
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:36,904
I just do not think it is
following me.

508
01:07:37,611 --> 01:07:39,224
Is not that a good thing?

509
01:07:40,109 --> 01:07:41,277
Yeah.

510
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:32,763
How are you people?

511
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,041
Okay.

512
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:37,349
How is Jay?

513
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:39,037
Not great.

514
01:08:42,936 --> 01:08:44,335
You had seen anything.

515
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:46,130
No.

516
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:48,160
Is it cool if I go in?

517
01:08:48,244 --> 01:08:49,740
I do not think so.

518
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:51,677
She does not want
to open her door.

519
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:54,455
She is just hiding in there.

520
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,990
I thought she is better.

521
01:08:58,848 --> 01:09:00,991
Can I tell her call you later?

522
01:09:01,094 --> 01:09:02,233
Yeah.

523
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:04,174
Okay.

524
01:09:04,327 --> 01:09:06,932
You really have not seen anything.

525
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:08,652
Nope.

526
01:09:08,752 --> 01:09:10,601
She did not make it up.

527
01:09:11,396 --> 01:09:13,502
I will know eventually. Right?

528
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,724
That chair broke in mid air.

529
01:09:17,004 --> 01:09:20,641
I mean something knocked me over and
the door did not break on its own.

530
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:24,789
Look, something happened, But
it is not what she thinks. Okay.

531
01:09:25,219 --> 01:09:27,635
What do you think it was then?

532
01:09:31,363 --> 01:09:32,985
I will see you later people.

533
01:09:33,457 --> 01:09:35,551
- Bye, Greg.
- Bye.

534
01:11:24,728 --> 01:11:26,569
<i>Hi. This is Greg.
Leave a message.</i>

535
01:11:42,358 --> 01:11:45,810
Greg! Open the door. Greg!

536
01:11:57,198 --> 01:11:58,718
Greg. Watch out!

537
01:12:14,022 --> 01:12:15,858
Greg does not open the door!

538
01:12:16,776 --> 01:12:18,437
What the fuck? Mom.

539
01:16:41,088 --> 01:16:42,427
Who is it?

540
01:16:42,626 --> 01:16:43,788
<i>Paul.</i>

541
01:16:47,428 --> 01:16:48,820
Hang on.

542
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,097
It is going to be here
soon or later.

543
01:17:32,233 --> 01:17:34,211
You could pass it on.

544
01:17:36,772 --> 01:17:38,309
You did once.

545
01:17:38,758 --> 01:17:40,180
Should not have.

546
01:17:42,195 --> 01:17:43,672
I could.

547
01:17:44,913 --> 01:17:46,026
No.

548
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:49,671
I like you too. You know.

549
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:54,445
Why did you pick Greg?

550
01:17:55,586 --> 01:17:57,784
I thought he would be okay.

551
01:18:01,289 --> 01:18:03,266
He was not scared.

552
01:18:06,618 --> 01:18:09,571
He said to go to high school
was not a big deal.

553
01:18:37,907 --> 01:18:39,937
I want to help.

554
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:42,012
Do you want to help me?

555
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:45,396
Yeah. I do.

556
01:19:16,353 --> 01:19:17,640
Jay?

557
01:19:18,052 --> 01:19:19,307
What?

558
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:22,153
Do you trust me?

559
01:19:25,904 --> 01:19:29,457
Do you remember where
we were our first kiss.

560
01:19:45,831 --> 01:19:47,002
You know where to go?

561
01:19:47,027 --> 01:19:49,234
I know how to go
there. You will see.

562
01:19:51,751 --> 01:19:54,278
I have not been to the pool
since I was 14.

563
01:19:54,865 --> 01:19:56,976
Who brought you there?

564
01:19:57,693 --> 01:19:58,722
Okay.

565
01:19:58,964 --> 01:20:02,683
That is where I had my first beer.
I threw up the whole night.

566
01:20:02,723 --> 01:20:05,706
- In the pool?
- No. Outside the car.

567
01:20:05,707 --> 01:20:07,047
In addition, in the car.

568
01:20:07,556 --> 01:20:08,911
Paul used to pee in it.

569
01:20:08,936 --> 01:20:10,482
It is disgusting.

570
01:20:10,507 --> 01:20:12,993
Whatever. There is chlorine.

571
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,114
When I was a little girl.

572
01:21:00,384 --> 01:21:03,095
My parents would not allow me
to go south of eighth mile.

573
01:21:04,164 --> 01:21:07,204
I did not even know what that
meant, until I got a little older.

574
01:21:07,228 --> 01:21:09,434
I started realizing that.

575
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:12,451
That is where the city started and
the suburb ended.

576
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:16,811
Moreover, I used to think about
how shitty and weird that was.

577
01:21:17,228 --> 01:21:18,228
I mean.

578
01:21:18,252 --> 01:21:23,423
I had to ask permission to go to the state
fair with my best friend and her parents.

579
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:27,016
Only because it was a few blocks
past the border.

580
01:21:27,246 --> 01:21:29,434
My mom said the same thing.

581
01:22:22,443 --> 01:22:24,459
How long do you think it will be?

582
01:22:27,668 --> 01:22:29,168
I do not know.

583
01:22:29,749 --> 01:22:31,623
Hours. I bed.

584
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,468
DO NOT IMMERSE

585
01:26:26,011 --> 01:26:27,650
My God!

586
01:26:28,874 --> 01:26:30,914
It just walked into the building.
It is right there.

587
01:26:30,921 --> 01:26:32,133
It is here.

588
01:26:32,483 --> 01:26:33,641
Right there!

589
01:26:34,046 --> 01:26:36,665
Jay. What do you see?

590
01:26:37,521 --> 01:26:39,513
I do not want to tell you.

591
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:42,130
Jay. I need you to point at it.
Okay.

592
01:26:42,214 --> 01:26:44,886
Keep your finger aim at it.
Therefore, we can see where it is.

593
01:26:49,446 --> 01:26:51,534
Is it getting in the water?

594
01:26:53,672 --> 01:26:56,381
It is just standing there,
staring at me.

595
01:26:57,376 --> 01:26:58,799
It is moving.

596
01:26:58,843 --> 01:27:00,252
What is it doing?

597
01:27:00,277 --> 01:27:02,138
It is walking. It is just walking.

598
01:27:03,431 --> 01:27:05,971
- Paul. I want to get out.
- Not, just wait for it to get in.

599
01:27:05,996 --> 01:27:08,076
No. I do not want to do this.
I just want to get out!

600
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:09,686
- What the fuck?
- Jay!

601
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:10,970
Out of there!

602
01:27:11,808 --> 01:27:13,745
She is going been electrocuted.

603
01:27:13,947 --> 01:27:15,404
No. It did not working.

604
01:27:15,429 --> 01:27:17,132
- You okay.
- Yeah.

605
01:27:17,157 --> 01:27:19,277
- Did not work.
- Thank god.

606
01:27:22,162 --> 01:27:23,750
Jay. Look out!

607
01:27:24,701 --> 01:27:27,487
- My god! Somebody help her.
- What do we do?

608
01:27:44,046 --> 01:27:46,123
What is going on?

609
01:28:02,007 --> 01:28:03,951
Jay keeps pointing at it.

610
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:12,847
It is right there.

611
01:28:15,795 --> 01:28:17,277
Where is it?

612
01:28:19,073 --> 01:28:20,789
Watch out. Do not get too close!

613
01:28:20,883 --> 01:28:22,579
It is right there.

614
01:28:24,692 --> 01:28:26,254
Yara!

615
01:28:34,186 --> 01:28:35,381
Where?

616
01:28:35,905 --> 01:28:37,026
Here?

617
01:28:38,207 --> 01:28:39,733
- Here?
- Right there.

618
01:28:50,009 --> 01:28:51,272
Where is it?

619
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:05,889
- Jay!
- Come on, Jay! Swim.

620
01:29:07,804 --> 01:29:10,025
- Give me your hand!
- Come on! Hurry up!

621
01:29:12,018 --> 01:29:13,162
Jay!

622
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:01,606
Jay?

623
01:30:02,938 --> 01:30:04,417
Do you see it?

624
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:06,283
Is it still down there?

625
01:32:43,179 --> 01:32:45,521
Do you feel any different?

626
01:33:01,648 --> 01:33:03,316
And you.

627
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,714
No.

628
01:34:04,731 --> 01:34:08,308
<i>"When there is torture,
there is pain and wounds,"</i>

629
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:13,467
<i>physical agony, and all this distracts
the mind from mental suffering,</i>

630
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:18,435
<i>so that one is tormented only by the
wounds until the moment of death.</i>

631
01:34:20,181 --> 01:34:24,957
<i>But the most terrible agony may
not be in the wounds themselves.</i>

632
01:34:25,103 --> 01:34:28,803
<i>But in knowing for certain
that within a hour.</i>

633
01:34:29,152 --> 01:34:33,377
<i>Then within ten minutes,
then within half a minute.</i>

634
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:36,862
<i>Now at this very instant.</i>

635
01:34:37,152 --> 01:34:39,171
<i>Your soul will leave your body.</i>

636
01:34:39,272 --> 01:34:42,201
<i>And you will no longer
be a person.</i>

637
01:34:42,889 --> 01:34:44,892
<i>And that is certain.</i>

638
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:49,698
<i>The worst thing is that
it is certain.”</i>
