No. You guys go.

I'm…

316
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,541
I'm gonna get ready for bed.

[softly] What question?

[shakily] How am I?

330

Or a yummy chip, Peng?

351
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,208
- [Rueben] That's not the right one.

Oh, no, no.

Get back, Snow, or you'll step in it.

[Cam] Now it's all out,
you'll feel better.

382
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,875
It's all right. That's it. There you go.

They're fine.

647
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,875
- Go! Go!
- [squawking]

648
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,041
Whoo!

649
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,875
- You're looking good.
- Yeah, it was pretty amazing.

650
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:37,666
I just did lots of yoga.
I didn't speak to anyone for weeks.

651
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,958
I didn't drink anything.

652
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,416
We should get Mum to go.

653
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,625
[Kylie laughing] Yeah.

654
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,000
- [Jan] Hi.
- Hey.

655
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,583
[Jan] How about I put some coffee on?
Do you need anything?

656
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,166
No, I'm fine. Thanks, Mum.

657
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,750
What about some cheese and bikkies?

658
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,791
It's all good.

659
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,000
Nuts?

660
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,958
Okay, great. That sounds perfect.

661
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,833
[boys laughing outside]

662
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:00,875
- Are you cross with me?
- No.

663
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:05,583
Why would I be cross with you?
I'm the one who told you to go.

664
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,750
So…

665
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,208
I would kill for a glass of wine.

666
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,416
- When was the last time you went out?
- I go out.

667
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,208
Yeah? Where? And not to the doctor's.

668
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,708
I mean, when was
the last time you just went out?

669
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:22,083
So, what do you say? Let's go for lunch.

670
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,333
That would do us a world of good.

671
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,083
Come on, Sammy.

672
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,041
[Kylie] Why is he even parking there?

673
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,083
- [Jan] He's not even handicapped.
- [Kylie] I know.

674
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,833
Can we please not park here?

675
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:39,750
[Kylie] What?

676
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,541
No, Cam gave me a sticker, Sam.

677
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:45,833
- I don't want to use that.
- [Jan] It's convenient, darling.

678
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:48,458
- It doesn't mean that...
- [Sam] I don't care, Mum.

679
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:50,250
You're not a spastic.

680
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,833
- No one thinks that.
- Oh my God. I wasn't saying that.

681
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:55,041
- Mum! Never ever!
- [Sam] You can't say that word.

682
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,541
That was the correct term.
I had a cousin who was a spastic.

683
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,833
- Oh my God.
- [Jan] Mary, you remember her.

684
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,583
- Please. I...
- [Jan] She had lovely red hair.

685
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:04,458
No, I'll get the chair.

686
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,666
I'll get the chair.

687
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,000
[Kylie] You okay?

688
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,416
[Jan] You okay, darling?

689
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,458
- [Kylie] Oh!
- [Jan] Oh, careful.

690
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,333
- [Kylie] It's all right.
- [Jan] You all right?

691
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,083
- Thank you.
- Great, thank you.

692
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,500
So, what do you feel like, sweetheart?

693
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:23,166
You've gotta have a glass of wine.

694
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,375
- [Kylie] We should share a bottle.
- [Jan] Maybe a nice...

695
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:27,750
- Let's do that.
- [Jan] Oh, hi! Bron!

696
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,041
- [Bron] Sam?
- [Jan] Hi.

697
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,250
- [Kylie] Hi, Bron.
- Hi.

698
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:32,916
[woman] Sam, hi.

699
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,833
Hi.

700
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,291
How are you?

701
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:38,291
- Yeah, good.
- Oh, I know. I'm sorry, a silly question.

702
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,916
- No, it's okay.
- Came up to see you the other day.

703
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,291
Oh yeah, right.

704
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,583
Thanks, um… thanks for the flowers.

705
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,208
Kids loved the lasagne.

706
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,500
- Uh, I was at the physio.
- [Bron] Yeah. Yeah.

707
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,625
No, it's okay. I get it.

708
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:55,125
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm here

709
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:57,041
and whatever you need, I'm… you know.

710
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,500
Maybe see you in a few weeks, yeah.

711
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,166
What are you up to, Bron?

712
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,291
- Oh yeah.
- Oh.

713
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:08,208
Same old, same old.
Um, back on ward 20 in the hospital.

714
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,125
- Oh.
- Yeah.

715
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,708
Kids' school fundraiser's coming up.

716
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:14,166
That's about as exciting as it gets.
Um… [voice fading]

717
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,791
I'm just hanging out for Christmas.
We'll head back up to Noosa.

What do you mean?

809
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:35,625
Are you serious?

810
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:37,750
You love the water.

811
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:40,208
You don't get it.

812
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:45,416
- [squawking]
- What are you scared of?

813
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:48,250
The worst that can happen
is you'll be embarrassed.

814
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:50,083
- Hey, Peng.
- [Cam] But at least you tried.

815
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:52,375
[Sam] How about another thing
to make me feel useless?

816
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,958
So, what do you need, Sam?
'Cause I'm running out of ideas.

817
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,000
The boys and I, we're struggling.

818
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,583
Oh, you're struggling?

819
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:02,041
Yes, it's all of us, Sam.

820
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:03,666
[Sam] No, it's not!

821
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,500
[Cam] Just tell me what you want.

822
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,000
[Sam] Uh, anything but this.

823
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:11,833
- I wanna walk the boys to school.
- Let's go for a skate.

824
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:13,958
[Sam] I wanna get dressed by myself.

825
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,291
I want a day without pain.

826
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,208
[door slams shut]

827
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:28,833
[Penguin croaking]

828

[exhales deeply]

829
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,000
[whispers] Hey.

830
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:53,166
Will one of you please clean up this mess?

831
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:06,583
[Penguin squawks]

832
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,208
[squawking continues]

833
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:15,916
[squawking intensifies]

834
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:17,750
[Noah] Shush, Peng.

835
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,583
[squawking loudly]

836
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,916
[Sam moaning]

837
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,708
[breathing heavily]

838
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:30,791
- Mum!
- [Sam gasps]

839
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,166
[squawking continues]

840
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,375
Okay.

841
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:34,750
Thanks, bud.

842
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,916
No, don't lift me. Just fix my legs.

843
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,541
[Noah] Oh, I'll get Dad.

844
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:39,500
[Sam] It's okay.

845
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
[Noah] No. Just let me help you.

846
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:43,958
[Sam] Just give me a sec. [grunting]

847
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:46,041
- [straining]
- [Noah] Just go slow.

848
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:48,041
Just pull the chair.

849
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:51,041
- [groaning]
- [chair hits ground]

850
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,083
- Can you grab that pillow?
- [Noah] Yeah.

851
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,000
[Sam] Okay.

852
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,041
That's it, babe. That's it.

853
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,041
You got it.

854
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,750
- You're good.
- [croaking]

855
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,666
[Noah] Here, I'll just move this.

856
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,791
Go, please.

857
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:06,708
- [Noah] Okay.
- [grunts]

858
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:11,083

[squawks]

870
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,166
- [Noah] Go, Peng!
- [squawks]

871
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,875
- [Noah] Whoo!
- Dad, look!

872
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,958
- [Noah] Go, Peng!
- [Rueben] Look! Go, Peng!

873
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,000
- [Noah] Go!
- [Oli] Peng!

874
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:04,208
Sammy! Sam!

875
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,166
- [Rueben] Let's go, Peng.
- [Oli] Let's go.

876
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,541
Woo-hoo!

877
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,000
Sam!

878
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:12,916
I'm okay. It's fine.

879
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,708
- [Cam breathing heavily]
- [boys cheering]

880
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,500
You're not missing this.

881
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,833
- Is she flying?
- Yeah.

882
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:25,916
[both straining]

883
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:28,250
[Cam grunts]

884
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:29,666
[both breathing heavily]

885
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,791
You wait.

886
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:32,291
- Yeah, go, Peng!
- Go, Peng!

887
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,666
- [Noah] Peng, you can do it!
- [Oli] Yeah!

888
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,291
- [Noah] Whoo!
- [chuckles]

889
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:38,166
- Go, Peng!
- Yes, Peng!

890
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,500
[Rueben] Knew you could do it!

891
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:41,833
Go, Peng!

892
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,708
- Go on, Peng!
- Woo-hoo!

893
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:44,791
[whistles]

[papers rustling]

[boys chattering indistinctly]

905
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:02,125
[woman] Hello.

906
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,250
You must be the Blooms.

907
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:07,375
I'm Gaye.

908
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,375
- Cameron. We spoke on the phone.
- Uh-huh.

909
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,916
Cameron tells me you're quite the surfer.

910
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,958
Was.

911
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:19,583
[Gaye] And a nurse.

912
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:23,708
And a mum. By the looks of these jokers,
it couldn't have been a walk in the park.

913
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:25,541
[all chuckling]

914
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:27,125
You seem a bit nervous.

915
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,750
I'm in a wheelchair.

916
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:31,375
Well, wouldn't you rather be in a kayak?

917
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,291
[chuckles]

918
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:35,875
[Gaye] Right.
You hold the front. I'll take the back.

919
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:38,208
And, uh, pass the paddle to Sam, please.

920
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:43,833
Yep. Okay, pull it out.

921
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:48,666
So I want you to practice paddling.

922
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:50,625
Gentle hands, Cam.

923
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,708
- Jeez, he goes in strong, doesn't he?
- [chuckles]

924
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:57,000
Okay, so I want you
to think about it like it's swimming,

925
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:01,500
except you're gonna scoop the water
with the paddle instead of your hands.

926
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:04,375
Try and feel it on the blade
until you get a good catch.

927
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:07,416
Yeah. Eyes straight ahead.

928
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:10,166
You look to the side,
you'll lean to the side.

929
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:12,416
Right.

930
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,541
Yeah, flick it off at the side
at the waist.

931
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:17,583
Good.

932
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:18,666
That's it.

933
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:24,083
The more comfortable you are,
the quicker you'll go.

934
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:26,166
- Relax and breathe.
- [shutter clicking]

935
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,291
- [Rueben] You're doing great, Mum!
- [Gaye] Looking a bit tense there, Sam.

936
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:33,375
- [Sam exhales]
- [Gaye] Okay. Okay.

937
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:36,208
Now we've come
to the most important part of the lesson.

938
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:39,000
I want you to tip over.

939
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:42,208
- What?
- You heard me. Get in there.

940
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:43,916
No way.

941
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
What's the worst thing that can happen?
You swim, don't you?

942
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,166
You still have your arms.
They must be good for something.

943
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:54,083
Come on, it's like riding a bike.

944
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,833
I can't do that either.

945
00:54:55,916 --> 00:54:58,208
Don't make me tip you out, Sam.

946
00:54:58,791 --> 00:54:59,833
You wouldn't.

947
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:02,458
Oh, I tip people all the time.
I'm known for it.

948
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:15,750
I can't.

949
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,333
Can't do it.

950
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:18,791
This is the easy part.

951
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:20,583
This is falling off the bike.

952
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:24,916
I said I can't!

953

01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:18,083
- [Oli] Will we still get cake?
- [Rueben] Of course we will, ding-dong.

1127
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:20,708
- [Noah] It's chocolate.
- [Oli] Don't call me a ding-dong.

1128
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,666
What if she couldn't reach her phone?

1129
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,000
- [Sam] Oh my God.
- [Jan] What if it wasn't charged?

1130
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:27,208
We don't talk in what-ifs, Jan.
We live our life.

1131
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:29,083
- [Sam] Cam, don't.
- [Jan] Oh yes.

1132
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:33,083
All fun and no responsibility.
Look where that's got you.

1133
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:36,500
- I might, uh, go for a swim as well.
- Please sit down, Gaye.

1134
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:38,416
- It's fine.
- And, Jan, if you're implying...

1135
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,333
No, she's not implying. It's just…

1136
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:42,375
Leave her alone.
She's drunk and emotional.

1137
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:43,500
I heard that.

1138
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:46,208
Well, yes, of course.
You're three feet away, Mum.

1139
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:48,125
- When your poor father died...
- Oh.

1140
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:49,625
- I'm just... Okay.
- [Cam] Sit, please.

1141
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,666
[Sam] No, no, please. May as well stay.

1142
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:55,666
When your poor father died, I thought,
at least I've still got the girls.

1143
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:59,416
But now
I just lie awake at night worrying.

1144
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,458
And I don't?

1145
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,333
All I ever do is worry.

1146
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:06,750
I worry if I'm too happy in front of Sam
or too sad in front of the boys.

1147
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:09,166
I worry if I should take them
to the beach

1148
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,208
or if that's us being selfish. I worry…

1149
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:14,750
I worry if I do too much for Sam
or not enough.

1150
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:15,666
[Jan] I know.

1151
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,958
I worry Sam can't walk
because I moved her after she fell.

1152
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,250
No, darling,
that's got nothing to do with it...

1153
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:22,375
Believe me, Jan. I worry.

1154
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:24,250
I'm sorry, love. I'm just…

1155
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:26,666
I'm just scared.

1156
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,958
I wanna make my little girl well again,
and I can't.

1157
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,458
- And it makes me crazy. I just...
- Shh.

1158
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:35,041
Well, don't shush me.

1159
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,041
No, no, no. Shh.

1160
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,125
- Can you hear that?
- [Cam] What?

1161
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:39,583
Is that Penguin?

1162
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:41,083
[squawking]

1163
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,166
- [Cam] Hey! Hey! Leave her alone!
- [banging]

1164
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,833
- [Sam] Oh no!
- [Kylie] Penguin!

1165
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:51,083
[Cam] Back up!

1166
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,500
- Penguin!
- [Kylie] Penguin!

1167
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,083
- [Cam] Leave her alone!
- Hey!

1168
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:56,208
- What's happening?
- Hey!

1169
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:58,791
[all shouting indistinctly]

1170
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,458
Penguin!

1171
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:03,500
- [all clamoring]
- [birds squawking]

1172
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,000
Penguin!

1173
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:09,083
- [clamoring continues]
- [squawking continues]

1174
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,375
Penguin!

1175
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:11,833
- Hey!
- [Noah] Dad!

1176
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:13,791
Leave her alone, you mongrels.

1177
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,041
Oh no.

1178
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:16,041
No!

1179
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:17,666
[boys] Penguin! Penguin! No!

1180
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,750
- Peng!
- [Noah] Penguin!

1181
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,083
Peng!

1182
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,208
[Noah] Come back!

1183
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:22,125
[Oli] Penguin!

1184
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,333
- [Noah] Peng!
- [Rueben] Peng!

1185
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,791
[breathing heavily]

1186
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:29,166
[Noah] Come back!

1187
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:31,708
- [Oli] Penguin!
- [Rueben] She went down there.

1188
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,750
Oh, sweetheart. [kisses]

1189
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:37,708
Come on.

1190
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:42,708
[dramatic music playing]

1191
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:50,833
Penguin!

1192
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:54,708
[Jan] I knew it.

1193
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:57,416
Not an umbrella amongst the lot of you.

1194
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,166
We're about to head home.
There's no point in this weather.

1195
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,833
Maybe she's at the beach.

1196
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:03,791
It's getting dark, Snow.

1197
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,833
Just five more minutes, please.

1198
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,708
You're all gonna get sick.

1199
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:09,875
Let's give him five more. Go! Go!

1200
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:13,500
Penguin!

1201
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,041
[Cam grunts]

1202
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,416
Why did they do it?

1203
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:21,041
Penguin wouldn't hurt anyone.

1204
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,125
[Noah] Peng!

1205
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:24,500
Magpies are territorial, mate.

1206
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:26,791
Technically, this isn't Penguin's home.

1207
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:28,208
It's theirs.

1208
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:30,125
[Noah] Penguin!

1209
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,000
But we're her home.

1210
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:34,375
I know, sweetheart. I know.

1211
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:36,875
[Noah] Penguin!

1212
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:51,166
[sighs]

1213
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:55,333
[thunder rumbles]

1214
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,333
[thunder rumbles]

1215
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:36,333
[sighs]

1216
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,958
[Noah] <i>…other days it could have broken.</i>

1217
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:53,666
<i>But it waited for Mum.</i>

1218
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,708
<i>And I'm the one who took her there.</i>

1219
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:02,583
<i>I wish it was me who leant on that fence.</i>

1220
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,000
<i>I wish it was me who broke my back.</i>

1221
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:09,916
[gasps]

1222

[footsteps receding]

1224
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:43,958
[fireworks exploding]

1225
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:46,958
Is it New Year's Eve?

1226
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,500
No.

1227
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,916
Then why are there fireworks?

1228
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,000
I don't know.

1229
01:10:57,666 --> 01:10:59,166
'Cause sometimes

1230
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,750
nice things just happen.

1231
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,083
[fireworks continue exploding]

1232
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:10,750
Are you mad at Noah?

1233
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:18,666
'Cause anyone could've let her out.

1234
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:21,625
I know.

1235
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:30,291
[Noah] Penguin!

1236
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,375
[dogs barking in distance]

1237
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:37,500
Peng!

1238
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,375
Penguin!

1239
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:43,291
[dogs continue barking]

1240
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,875
Penguin!

1241
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:54,583
Peng!

1242
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:00,625
[dramatic music playing]

1243
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,958
[birds squawking in distance]

1244
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:48,708
You all right, Snow?

1245
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,875
Do you think she's dead?

1246
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:58,583
Jeez, Roo, no.

1247
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,291
She's just scared.

1248
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:03,875
Give her time to find her way home.
She knows where we are.

1249
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,125
And Penguin's tough.
Isn't that right, Sammy?

1250
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,041
Noah?

1251
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,708
He's okay. He's just…

1252
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:16,375
[Sam] Noah, it's not your fault.

1253
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,375
[Cam] Of course it's not your fault.

1254
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:20,583
[Sam] You've got to stop this.

1255
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:22,541
You've gotta let it go.

1256
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,583
You're not to blame for Penguin,
and you're not to blame for my accident.

1257
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:30,750
[Cam] Okay. Okay. Let's not turn this
into something it's not. Just...

1258
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:33,333
- He thinks he is. Don't you, Noah?
- [Cam] Oh, Sam.

1259
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:34,750
Why do we have to talk about this?

1260
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:37,208
Because I'm tired of not talking about it.

1261
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:39,541
Please don't walk away.

1262
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:46,375
You say I'm not to blame, Mum,
but you don't mean it.

1263
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:47,583
[Cam] Of course she means it.

1264
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:49,458
You don't know anything, Dad.

1265
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:53,041
- Hey, hey, that's enough.
- You don't see the way she looks at me.

1266
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:55,416
- Inside voices, mate...
- Oh, shut up, Cam.

1267
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,000
Please, Noah, if you've got
something to say, just say it.

1268
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:07,583
Please. I need you to talk to me.

1269
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,541
It's my fault we went up that tower.
It was my idea.

1270
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,583
I'm the reason you broke your back.

1271
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:17,833
You happy?

1272
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:20,708
No, I'm not happy.

1273
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,500
And sometimes I think
I'll never be happy again

1274
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,208
but not because of you.

1275
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:30,500
Then why don't you ever wanna talk
to me or be near me?

1276
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,625
- I don't know. I've made lots of mistakes.
- [Noah] You hug Oli all the time.

1277
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,291
- You can't look at me!
- I'm scared.

1278
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:40,250
I'm just terrified that all this anger
will just come spewing out of me.

1279
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:44,125
Not just at you, at all of… all of you.

1280
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,916
Me too. You, Cam.

1281
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:52,375
