[woman narrating] What makes
a person extraordinary?

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,025
Everyone wants to be normal.

4
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,986
But no one wants to be ordinary.

5
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,612
[chattering]

6
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,448
And what is normal?

7
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,534
We all see the pretty
pictures on our feeds.

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:38,914
Normal party, normal family,
normal adorable little girl.

9
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:43,878
But, there's always
more behind the facade.

10
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,298
Most of the time
Lindy seems quite normal.

11
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:52,303
But buried deep in
her DNA she has a gift.

12
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:56,932
Some call it a condition,
or even worse, a disorder,

13
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,935
that's just
waiting to be activated

14
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:03,564
and it makes
her anything but normal.

15
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,651
When people do bad things,

16
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,196
Lindy cannot control herself.

17
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,408
Maybe if she'd had
that normal loving family,

18
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:17,203
she could have
been extraordinary.

19
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:23,626
But, just like Lindy, mommy
and daddy had their own demons.

20
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,962
Whether it was that mummy's
pills made her so sleepy,

21
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:31,634
or that daddy got so
angry when he drank too much,

22
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,428
we'll never know.

23
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:39,892
But whatever it was, Lindy
never got the love she needed.

24
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,604
Instead, she got
angrier and angrier,

25
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,358
and her disorder
got worse and worse.

26
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:53,280
And then her parents
got her diagnosis.

27
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:57,785
The doctors called it
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

28
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,000
She could not
live safely in the world,

29
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:09,505
and no one would
be safe around her.

30
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:13,509
So to live at all,
she would have to live alone,

31
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,638
isolated from others
till the cure could be found.

32
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,725
The huge amount of cortisol
coursing through Lindy's body,

33
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,646
made her faster than
normal, stronger than normal,

34
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,732
which made her
incredibly attractive

35
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,235
to certain interested parties.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,784
But her condition also
made her extremely volatile

37
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:48,085
and far, far
angrier than normal.

38
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:54,633
Lindy had a hair trigger.
Once provoked, she would snap.

39
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,306
Until she could gain control,
she was no use to anyone.

40
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,059
Her life as
a human lab rat began.

41
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:07,021
The results were mixed.

42
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,610
So they thought,
maybe the military

43
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,028
would give her the structure

44
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,947
to channel her unique gifts.

45
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,577
Or maybe not.

so kind and supportive.

55

It's a wonder it didn't help.

56
00:03:55,945 --> 00:04:00,783
Of course, all these
cures only made it worse.

57
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,036
You would think they'd
learn not to piss her off.

[grunts]

59
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:11,210
It was looking more and more
like they would just lock her up

60
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,003
and throw away the key.

61
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,092
Lindy would be alone, forever.

62
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:23,931
And then a breakthrough,
a chance to be normal.

63
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,768
The treatment was
brutal, barbaric, outrageous

64

00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,551
- No, I'm not.
- Sir. You are.

164
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,715
You're making it impossible
for me to impress my date

165
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,639
and it's embarrassing.

166
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,140
How about the chicken?

167
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,226
[electricity crackles]

168
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:40,896
[waitress] Sure.

169
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,439
Thank you.

170
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,650
Let me know if
you need anything else.

171
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,734
Thank you.

172
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,547
You know, if you were planning
to stab her with that knife,

173
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,739
it'd be totally cool with me.

174
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,535
Look, I have to pee actually.

175
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,204
- Okay.
- [Lindy] I'll be right back.

176
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,962
[waitress laughs]
I know, right?

177
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,506
A guy just told
his wife he is having an affair.

178
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,802
Some old woman's
dentures got stuck in her steak.

179
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,055
But hold up, you should see
the first date I just served.

180
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,473
I gave the guy some attitude

181
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,059
and he practically
cried into his napkin.

182
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,853
Yeah. And his date just sat
there and watched him squirm.

183
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,232
[laughs] Oh, my God.
It was so embarrassing.

184
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,377
I mean, screwing with the
customers isn't fun anymore.

185
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,278
It's like my own
private freak show.

186

[electricity crackles]

187
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,947
The guy had, like,

188
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,158
allergies to pretty much
everything on the menu.

189
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,327
[laughs] It was pathetic.

190
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,497
[laughs] I know.

191
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,124
[sighs] Total losers.

192
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,542
Anyway...

193
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,751

204
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,755
Ow!

205
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,757
Fuck!

206
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,099
[Lindy] It's not working.

207
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,018
Okay. Fix it!

208
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,955
You're probably just
building up a tolerance.

209
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,231
No, I'm not.

210
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,566
Look, this is cutting-edge,
avant-garde treatment.

211
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,859
Okay. Well,
I'm sure you'll get

212
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,319
the Nobel Prize once
you're dead.

213
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,779
Is that a threat?

214
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,364
Can you fix it or not?

215
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,029
- All right.
- [Lindy] Okay.

216
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,745
Here.

217
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,958
Your emotions must
be running pretty high,

218
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,043
in order for you
to override the system.

219
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,671
Yeah. I have an unnaturally
high level of cortisol,

220
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,215
so my emotions are
running high all the time.

221
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,552
But you cannot keep
using biochemistry as an excuse,

222
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,636
all the time.

223
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,558
So, I'm assuming that the date
was a disappointment then?

224
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,892
I mean... [sighs]

225
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,394
Given that its primary function,

226
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,522
was to test if I could partake
in a customary social situation

227
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,041
without beating
the shit out of someone,

228
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,185
then yeah, I would say yeah.

229
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,901
It was a... it was
a real disappointment.

230
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,278
How badly did you hurt him?

231
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,488
[sighs] I didn't
even get round to him.

232
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,908
Who did you get around to?

233
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,787
A waitress. Look, it doesn't
matter. Your thing failed.

234
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,624
Lindy, this is not
a cure. I've told you that.

235
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,348
The only way we're
going to make progress,

236
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,171
is if you begin to
reconcile with your past.

237
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,505
I've told you my story.

238
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,884
But there's a difference,
between talking about your past,

239
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,094
and actually working through it.

Classy.

247

Here you go.

248
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,745
I've upped the voltage,

249
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,997
but there's only so much

250
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,832
that the human body can take.

251
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,627
You don't care about
me. I'm just an experiment.

252
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,088
Why would I risk my
life's work if I didn't care?

253
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,299
And why won't you admit
that you really like this guy?

254
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,926
Because I didn't.

255
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,385
Okay.

256
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,595
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

257
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,930
I think last night proved that

258
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,015
your exposure therapy
didn't work.

259
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,643
What... what... what
would you like me to do? Hmm?

260
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,526
Would you like me to
put leeches on your skin?

261
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,230
Would you like me to drill
a hole,

262
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,315
in your head to release
the demons?

263
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,567
Would you like me to
make you drink your own urine?

264
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,652
Actually tried that.

265
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,237
That's disgusting.

266
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,864
Anyway, I think
that really you need to admit,

267
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,658
that the answer to all of
your problems

268
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,369
is close,
human connection.

269

gonna fix me, Dr. Freud.

And I've tried that as well.

for once have a relationship.

Oh, please fuck off.

274
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm talking about love.

275
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,880
No, I don't want a boyfriend!

276
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,192
We both know I'd end up knocking
his teeth down his throat.

277
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,236
Maybe you won't, but I don't
know why you would walk away,

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,053
from somebody
who made you feel something.

Ugh!

00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,639
Okay, I'm walking away
from you,

- [Justin] Not bad, huh?
- Well...

290
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,838
Not a shitty waitress in sight!

291
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,965
No.

292
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,383
I'm glad you called.

293
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,261
I'd hate to miss a second chance
to disappoint a pretty face.

294
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,054
How are you planning
on doing that?

295
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,473
I don't know.

296
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,059
Depends if you find lame-ass
accountants cool or not.

297
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,312
Well, that depends.
Who do you work for?

298
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,523
[Justin] I work for a private
company. This guy named Barry.

00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,608
You? What do you do?

300
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,193
I used to work in Security.

301
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:06,114
Okay. So you know your way
around a pair of handcuffs?

[laughs] You're not
a bouncer!

304
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,497
[chuckles] Yeah! What?

305
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,100
What do you weigh?
Like a Buck-O-Eight?

306
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,484
- It's not about size Justin.
- No?

307
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,877
Don't know what you've heard...

308
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,961
Then what's it about?

309
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:23,006
Other things,
like speed and endurance,

310
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,674
fearlessness, things like that.

311
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,551

I'm currently
seeking a new career path.

317

Oh, you got fired.

318
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,021
Yes. Well, it wasn't my fault.

319
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,984
It... I mean, it was
actually entirely my fault.

320
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,025
I don't know.
My heart wasn't in it.

No?

322

00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,498
But I wanted to give you the
chance to come in on your own

650
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,375
and clear up this
misunderstanding.

651
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,419
Without all the, you know, jail.

652
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,837
She's on her way up now.

653
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,214
- Fucking balls. Where are you?
- I'm parked out front.

654
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,716
She's not going
to shoot me, is she?

655
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,800
No, of course not.

656
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,885
- [detective] Freeze!
- Fuck!

657
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:32,970
[gunshot]

658
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,054
Then again, she might...

659
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,681
So here's what's gonna happen.

660
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,118
You're gonna put your arms over
your head, I'm gonna cuff you,

661
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,893
I'm gonna take
you down to the station,

662
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,163
- and then I'm gonna book you.
- What if I have other plans?

663
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,480
I'll fucking shoot you.

664
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,774
And then waste a bunch
of time writing up a report,

665
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,026
instead of hunting
down your boyfriend's killer.

666
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,737
Wasn't actually
my boyfriend yet.

667
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,863
Commitment issues?

668
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,448
It was early days.

669
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,426
[detective] As if dating in
the city wasn't hard enough.

670
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,285
You finally find a good man,

671
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,579
and boom,
two bullets to the brain.

672
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,164
Your partner is a trip, Vicars.

673
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,832
[Vicars] Hey, Nevin...

674
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,292
Is that?

675
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,128
Are you fucking kidding me?

676
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,963
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

677
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:18,849
Please don't tell me,

678
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,768
you just called
this murder suspect...

679
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,811
[both grunting]

680
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,104
[Nevin coughs, winces]

681
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,689
Sorry. Having a bad day.

682
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,941
- [Nevin] Freeze!
- I didn't kill him!

683
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,110
Bitch. [grunts]

684
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,368
- [car beeps]
- [engine starts]

685
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,537
- [Vicars] Hello?
- [Lindy] Oh. Hi, Detective.

686
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,874
Lindy, is everything
okay up there? Is Nevin okay?

687
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,793
[Lindy] Little
busy at the moment.

688
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,127
Busy doing what?

689
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,340
[Lindy] Remembering
how to drive stick.

690
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,424
What?

691
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,472
- Stupid motherfucker.
- Ow, ow, ow.

692
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,809
Holy shit! I know that sound.

693
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,811
That's a McLaren 600LT Spider?

694
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,270
[Lindy] It's a car.

695
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,025
A really fast one.

696
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,194
Are you still on the phone
with that kooky cuntcicle?

697
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,326
Fucking go! Go! Go!

698
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,874
Where did you learn to drive?
You even trying to catch her?

699
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,209
I'm flooring it!

700
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,895
[Lindy] Guys, it's
quite hard to concentrate

701
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,087
with you two bickering.

702
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,930
Oh!

703
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,766
- Oh, crap!
- [sirens wailing]

704
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,186
- Come on, Lindy.
- [Lindy] Ooh.

705
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,206
I think I'm starting to get
the hang of this stick shift.

706
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,607
Oh, shit. Reverse!

707
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:56,947
[Vicars grunts]

708
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,161
Damn it!

709
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,372
[horns honking]

710
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,500
Lindy, please stay on the phone.
I'm trying to help you.

711
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,003
Okay. I really
have to concentrate now,

712
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,963
so, it's been
really nice catching up.

713
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,049
[Vicars] No, wait! You go
through with this and you're...

714
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,593
You're on your own.

715
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:18,677
[Lindy] Same as always.

716
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,471
[Vicars] Lindy!

717
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,182
Damn it!

718
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,434
Shit!

719
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,936
[engine revving]

720
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,251
I'm trying to help you. You're
going to get somebody killed.

721
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,395
If you think I had anything to
do with Justin's death,

722
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,130
then you're shitter at your
jobs than I thought.

723
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,339
We don't think you killed
Justin...

724
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,364
Speak for yourself!

725
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,873
Whoa! Argh!

726
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,153
- [man 1] Get 'em!
- [man 2] Yeah!

727
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,079
Ah! The fuck...

728
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,790
- I'm not doing it.
- Don't bitch out!

729
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,958
Fine! Fine! Fine!

730
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,178
- Fuck.
- [tires squealing]

731
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,893
[both groan]

732
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,038
[car beeps]

733
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,767
[man] If you
can't ascertain the cause,

734
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,376
of the outbreak,
then you have no idea,

735
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,187
how many zombies
you'll have to kill over time.

736
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,380
[man 2] A lightsaber
would solve both problems.

737
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,924
We specified
a real-world scenario.

738
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,218
Yeah, a real zombie apocalypse.

739
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,341
Besides, there's no way
to recharge the lightsaber's

740
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,056
Diatium power cell
after it ran out. [raspberry]

741
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,267
Diatium power cells
don't run out of energy.

742
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,518
They recycle it.

743
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,064
Who's in charge around here?

744
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,026
I'm... I... I'm the manager.

745
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,235
If you're the manager

746
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,879
then you're the last person,
I want to talk to.

747
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,881
I need someone who actually
knows what they're doing.

748
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,785
Who's the biggest
geek you've got in this place?

749
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:47,868
- Andy.
- Andy.

750
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,952
Andy.

751
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:51,038
[dubstep music playing]

752
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,752
[footsteps approaching]

753
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,049
Okay, so what? Forget
your password or something?

754
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,175
No.

755
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,052
It's more, the man
I loved was murdered

756
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,803
and I stole
his phone from the police,

757
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,239
and now I've got to
track down the bad guy

758
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,307
before they do, so
I can kill the shit out of them.

759
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,184
Oh! Cool.

760
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,399
And... we're in.

761
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,525
Oh, wow. You're good.

762
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,069
Obviously.

763
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,238
Not much here, no
history. This must be a burner.

764
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,883
Your boyfriend
a drug dealer or something?

765
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,158
No, accountant.

766
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,703
I mean, he wasn't...
We weren't... yet. You know.

767
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,372
Yeah. Right, right. I get it.

768
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,583
- I don't.
- Did your mouth just fart, Doug?

769
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,834
Sorry.

770
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,503
[sighs]

771
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,688
[Andy] The last seven calls,

772
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,340
came from
an abandoned building downtown.

773
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,509
- Shady.
- What does that mean?

774
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,511
[Andy] I'm not sure.
Lets see who owns it.

775
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,892
Barry Kasparzki. Whoa!

776
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,353
FBI files showed
ties to arms dealers.

777
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,313
Holy shit!

778
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,856
[Andy] That's the guy.

779
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,109
How much do I owe you?

780
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,361
Trust me, you can't afford me.

781
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,529
Thanks.

782
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,739
Oh.

783
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,122
[electronic rock music playing]

784
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,794

Boys, boys, boys!

789
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,031
Whatever it is
you're fighting over,

790
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,599
I'm sure we can all talk it out.

791
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,933
[man] Money...

792
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:19,477
Yeah. You know, like bets?

793
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,646
Oh! Duh.

794
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,332
Is it too late to put
a dollar on the other one?

795
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,584
Just 'cause
you're a bit of a bleeder

796
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:25,835
and you drop
your left when you hook.

797
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,027
What's going on?

798
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,405
Oh, are you Barry? I guess so.

799
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,656
Just, you seem like,

800
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,050
you have
the biggest dick in here, so...

801
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,075
What do you want?

802
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,577
Well, I wanted
to pick your brains,

803
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,454
about the phone
calls you have with the...

804
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,289
accountant that works for you.

805
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,415
Did you kill him?

806
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,627
What are you? Cop? Fed?

807
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,545
Oh no, girlfriend.

808
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:46,922
I mean, I say girlfriend.

We went on,
like, two dates but...

810
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,468
you know, I was really
hopeful, I was crossing fingers.

811
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,719
I didn't kill any accountant.

812
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,262

- Probably!

I didn't say I'd tell you.

make me go through the whole,

I tell you what.

821
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,614
How about I beat
three of your best guys,

822
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,241
and you tell me the name?

are the, like, rules?

No rules.

kill me.

If I make this thing for you,

00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:30,799
Okay.

1140
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,556
Do you want some Chinese food?

1141
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,684
There's Kung Pao chicken
and sweet and sour... something,

1142
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:43,604
and some... egg
rolls and all that.

1143
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,105
You should eat something.

1144
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,941
Don't touch
the shrimp fried rice.

1145
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,027
- That's mine.
- [chuckles]

1146
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,199
I'll get the vest.

Je... Jesus!
What are you doing?

1153
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:31,479
I'm hiding from
the beat cops down the street.

1154
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:32,504
What are you doing?

1155
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:34,131
Is sitting outside my apartment,

1156
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,109
some kind of police foreplay?
Are you wearing my knickers?

1157
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,134
I'm doing my job.

1158
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,510
Oh.

1159
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:41,430
I see we've taken down
another major drug kingpin.

1160
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:45,059
He got sent home from school
for setting the class pet free.

1161
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,560
Hmm. Hamster?

1162
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,104
Rabbit. Hey, listen to me.

1163
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:51,940
There's some pretty nasty guys
in the hospital, you know, and

1164
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:54,026
their description of
the deranged psycho

1165
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,295
who put them there matches you.

1166
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,946
What? Come on. Little old me?

1167
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,132
How could you possibly think

1168
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,300
I could do anything like that?

1169
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,242
Don't fuck
around with me, Lindy.

1170
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:05,371
Okay, but not now,
I need you to look after this.

1171
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,598
I'm not dumping
evidence for you!

1172
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,123
I'm not asking you to.

1173
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:10,376
Look, I'm... I'm
giving you the chance

1174
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,710
to turn yourself in here.

1175
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:14,463
Okay, I will! Just not yet.

1176

Hey, listen to me.

1177
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,218
Fizel's not some
dickbag gangster, okay?

1178
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:20,445
He's going to be looking for you

1179
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,012
and he's going to kill you.

1180
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:23,931
Right. Well, he already tried.

1181
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,533
I think someone has
been in my apartment...

1182
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,184
Right, that's it.

1183
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,353
- It ain't your choice anymore.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1184
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,772
That's a very
bad idea. I've got...

1185
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,399
this condition. Okay?

1186
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:36,443
It makes me snap. I can't
control it and I hurt people.

I wear this thing,
that gives me electric shocks,

1188
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,531
so that I can stop it happening.

1189
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,491
But, really, I really
don't want to hurt you

1190
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,618
or anybody else.

1191
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,739
I don't think you'd hurt me.

1192

- No?
- No.

1193
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,083
Would you leave
me on my own with him?

[control clicking]

1195

- Yeah.
- Bollocks!

1196
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,130
Well, I don't think
you'd hurt him either.

1197
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,297
You sure?

1198
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,093
What that thing feel like?

Okay, you know
what that tells me?

1203
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,537
I'm way more
screwed up than you thought.

1204
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,789
No. No, it tells me
that you'd rather hurt yourself

1205
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:32,082
than somebody else.

I treat you different

I'm going easy on you.

1210
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:40,757
Is she right?

wanna play games anymore.

about it in your file...

Uh, I always thought
it was overrated and overpriced.

1250
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,398
Most people don't realize

1251
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:06,528
that lobster's belong in
the same biological phylum

1252
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,030
as cockroaches.

1253
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:14,870
They are both anthropods
with segmented bodies.

1254
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:19,416
They both have the same compound
eyes and jointed legs.

Even their meat is the same.

What the fuck has
this got to do with me?

1261
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,018
You are an odd specimen.

1262
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:45,734
Not sure what, uh,
phylum you belong in.

1263

Me neither.

1264
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:49,946
That's something my therapist
and I are really delving in to.

1265
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:53,200
I understand
you are here to kill me.

1266

We hadn't put a label on
it, but he was pretty special.

I kill a lot of people,

may be accountants. I'm...

I'm glad I took this
opportunity to get one good,

Fuck balls indeed.

1288
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:05,856
I'm getting the feeling

1289
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,316
there's no cookie
and juice after this.

1290
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,609
Not for you.

1291

Justin...

1293
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:15,449
Did you pull the trigger?

1294
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:20,036
No. I didn't.
Though I wish I had.

to take a sec so...

You know,
I gotta admit Lindy, uh...

Right toward the end there I...

1340
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,835
I didn't think you had it in ya.

1341

So, my apologies.

1342

I decided to take
care of Fizel myself.

What are you covered in?

Yeah, I just paid
off the coroner, you know?

1353
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:22,988
Why?

1354
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:24,948
[Justin] I had to
get Fizel out of the way.

1355
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,200
But the CIA can't
operate on US soil.

1356
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,411
Even the government,

1357
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,538
wouldn't be dumb
enough to go after him.

1358
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,289
Exactly.

1359
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:35,017
Yeah! I needed someone
from the outside, you know?

1360
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,752
Someone to draw
the attention away from myself.

1361
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:40,338
Someone who couldn't
be traced back to me.

1362
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:41,756
So you chose me?

1363
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,384
Why?

1364
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,053
A glowing
recommendation from Dr. Munchin.

1365
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:48,430
I mean, who do you think funds

1366
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,306
his batshit crazy experiments?

1367
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,808
But see, I...

1368
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:54,644
I knew you
were something else. Yeah.

1369
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:57,022
My little kamikaze K-9.

1370
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,399
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1371
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:02,277
Well, in the
Second World War, uh...

1372
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,279
they strapped bombs to dogs

1373
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,448
and they would train
them to run into enemy tanks.

1374
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:07,824
Right?

1375
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,719
The puppies thought they were
just gonna get a treat

1376
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:12,579
or something, but they got
detonated into dog-burger.

1377
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:13,955
Yeah.

1378
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,582
So I just had
to figure out what treats

1379
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,335
I needed to use
to train you to take out Fizel.

1380
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,259
And if you failed or
got killed in the process,

1381
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,131
well, you know? Cost me nothing.

1382
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,133
That's why you were perfect.

1383
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,551
Where's my car by the way?

1384

1389

Fizel was an asset
that became a liability.

1390
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:38,271
Everybody wanted him dead,

1391
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,397
but nobody can touch him.

was ever gonna stop?
