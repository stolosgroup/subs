<i>"Where dips
the rocky highland</i>

<i>"Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,</i>

<i>"There we've hid our faery vats,</i>

<i>"And the reddest
stolen cherries.</i>

"For the world's

15
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:49,406
"than you can understand."

16
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:09,860
<i>I'll never forget
The summer I was eight years old.</i>

17
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:16,298
<i>It was a summer of tea parties
and sword fights.</i>

18
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:22,739
<i>Of longing to grow up
and fearing to grow old.</i>

19
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,809
<i>Of wishing things
could stay the same forever.</i>

20
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:33,315
<i>That was the summer
we found the boat.</i>

21
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:37,788
I scalp rodent enemy.

22
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:40,222
I avenge brave chief.

23
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,459
- Let him go.
- Try and make me.

24
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:45,462
I'll get you!

25
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:46,897
Tiger Lily, come on.

26
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:49,533
Wait for me!

27
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:05,982
I am Pan,
God of the woodlands,

28
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,818
and these are my woods.

29
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:09,453
You're no Pan.

30
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:17,928
Take that!

31
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:20,664
Surrender
the Indian princess now,

32
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:24,034
or say goodbye to the hostage,
Chief Witchataw.

33
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,602
Never!

34
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:46,490
Oh!

35
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:51,393
I'll get it.

36
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:54,030
Mama said we're not supposed
to go over the wall.

37
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:57,567
Blimey.
Come and take a look at this.

38
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:11,948
Who do you think it belongs to?

39
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,451
Finders keepers.

40
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:16,653
It's ours now.

41
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:23,994
She just needs
a bit of fixing up.

42
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:27,363
Just imagine.
The three of us, mateys at sea.

43
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:30,700
Braving the elements to discover
uncharted territories.

44
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,841
Where to next, Captain?

45
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:40,577
But, David,
what if we get lost?

46
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,679
Well, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

47
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:46,817
We'll be the Lost Boys
of the wild. And girls.

48
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,421
Peter, I almost forgot.
I found this in the woods.

49
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:55,391
Do you reckon it's special?
To the Indians?

50
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,760
It's an eagle feather.

51
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,599
I'd better wash up.

52
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:48,612
Hurry along, you two.
Did you not see the time?

53
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:50,914
Oh dear, oh dear.
I shall be too late.

54
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:54,985
Hush, don't tease him.
He almost lost his scalp today.

55
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:58,955
Would you ever get a move on?
Go on, get in with you.

56
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:02,826
Did you forget your Aunt
Eleanor's coming for dinner?

57
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:04,961
Oh, you'll be the death of me,
the pair of you.

58
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:06,096
Mmm.

59
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:09,699
Who are these dirty vagabonds

60
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:12,669
and what have they done
with my children?

61
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:15,105
- Where's Peter?
- He went to speak with Father.

62
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:17,974
Upstairs, both of you.

63
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,876
Yes, but this one I keep.

64
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,444
- Get yourselves cleaned up.
- Come, talk to me.

65
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:22,846
I have something for you.

66
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:29,152
The tinker was in this morning,
mending the pots,

67
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:32,923
and when he was done, he found
he had some extra copper,

68
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:37,527
and with it he agreed
to fashion you a small present.

69
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:39,796
Would you like to see it?

70
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:47,504
- It's just a bell.
- Oh!

71
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,906
She didn't mean it, I promise.

72
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:52,776
No, no, it's alright.

73
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,967
- Let me guess.
- Oh!

74
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,002
- Peter.
- <i>The Golden Hind?</i>

75
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:22,272
You gave me a fright.

76
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:25,976
It's not suppertime
already, is it?

77
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,946
- Is it for old Mr. Brown?
- Right you are.

78
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,215
<i>The Golden Hind.</i>

79
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:38,722
The first ship to sail
all the way around the globe.

80
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:43,727
Imagine what it must be like
to see the whole world.

81
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,564
To sail the Indian Ocean
and the Pacific

82
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:51,735
and maybe even discover
new lands.

83
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:56,740
Ah... The things
she must have seen.

84
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:02,212
When the first baby laughed...

85
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:04,014
...for the first time,

86
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:08,118
its laugh broke
into a thousand pieces

87
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:10,954
and they all went
skipping about,

88
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:17,627
and that was the beginning
of the fairies.

89
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,098
You see, fairies are far
too magical for the human eye.

90
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:28,071
So when we look at them,
they take the form of bells.

91
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:32,842
Every child has a fairy
born just for them.

92
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:36,679
And this...

93
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:39,082
...tinker's bell
was born for you.

94
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:51,061
Tinker Bell.
It's wonderful to meet you.

95
00:08:58,168 --> 00:08:59,335
What's this?

96
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,308
"Dear Mr. Littleton,

97
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,943
"it is my duty to inform you

98
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:09,813
"that your son Peter
is currently failing...

99
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:13,083
"All his subjects."

100
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:16,886
- Peter.
- I know what she thinks.

101
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,656
I may not be David,
but I'm not a duffer.

102
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:23,093
Peter, who said anything
about David?

103
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,961
If you were a duffer,
would you be able to recite

104
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:26,963
a complete index
of British naval vessels

105
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:29,199
from the last decade
in under five minutes?

106
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:31,234
Would you be able to construct

107
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:35,839
a fully functioning
model galleon in a bottle?

108
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:37,907
Unlike your siblings,
I might add.

109
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:40,043
Eh?

110
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:41,344
I'm not in trouble, then?

111
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,214
Of course you're in trouble.

112
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:55,358
Look, you've got to try, Peter.

113
00:09:57,894 --> 00:09:59,129
For me?

114
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,402
Come here.

115
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:40,236
Careful, darling.

116
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:47,377
Last one.

117
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,313
Beware of the queen of hearts.

118
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:01,090
Easy does it.

119
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:06,463
Well done.

120
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:08,965
- Bravo.
- Bravo. Come on, darling.

121
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:10,833
Let's keep going.

122
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:14,804
This silly game has become
something of a family sport.

123
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:15,972
Our record is four decks,

124
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:19,242
but Jack thinks
we can do it in five.

125
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:22,178
You know, I'm...
I'm slightly shocked,

126
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:25,482
you allow him to have cards
in the house at all.

127
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:35,124
Red Queen captures White Queen.

128
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,464
- Alice, Jack.
- Coming!

129
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:43,032
All right, almost done,
almost done.

130
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,200
All right.

131
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:50,907
There you are.

132
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:58,781
Mmm. Don't you look handsome.

133
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:08,958
Not nearly as handsome
as you are beautiful, my queen.

134
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:23,039
Mmm.

135
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:26,276
My sis... My sister
is in the other room...

136
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:27,977
My sister's in the other room.

137
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,882
Rose?

138
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:41,525
- Oh, yeah.
- She's in rare form tonight.

139
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:43,159
Uh-oh.

140
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:57,441
David. What do you think
about dancing lessons?

141
00:12:57,474 --> 00:13:01,210
One must have lessons if one
hopes to ever attend a ball.

142
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:05,248
I don't think that's quite where
David's interests lie, Eleanor.

143
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,851
Mama, I wanted to ask if you...

144
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:11,622
Alice.
Speak when you're spoken to.

145
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:14,390
Really, child.

146
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:18,928
But if everybody
obeyed that rule

147
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:22,298
and you only spoke
when you were spoken to,

148
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:25,134
and the other person
always waited for you to begin,

149
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:28,338
nobody would ever say anything.

150
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:30,541
The Red Queen
does not tolerate disobedience.

151
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:32,241
Off with your head.

152
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,877
Alice, what was it
you wanted to ask?

153
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:38,114
A pardon
from the White Queen.

154
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:40,617
I wondered if you might help me
with a sewing project.

155
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:45,221
Ah, now, good girl. Sewing is
very becoming to a young lady.

156
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:47,624
I need to mend
my white rabbit's waistcoat.

157
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,092
It was torn this afternoon

158
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,495
when he was taken hostage
by Indian warriors.

159
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:54,397
Hmm. Poor thing.
Of course I'll help you.

160
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:56,633
Good heavens, Rose,

161
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,968
the girl's fingernails
are gnawed to the quick,

162
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,304
and what's left of them
is black with dirt.

163
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:03,607
She was
playing outside, Ellie.

164
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,610
- It's what children do.
- No, it's what boys do.

165
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:09,680
It's quite a different matter
with girls.

166
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:13,249
For heaven's sake, this is not
a way to raise a daughter.

167
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:16,119
Which you would know from your wealth
of experience raising children?

168
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,027
It's brilliant.

169
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:27,296
Well, children,
I have some very exciting news.

170
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,965
- David has been...
- No...

171
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:33,670
David has been accepted
to Bristlemoss School.

172
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:37,206
He starts the new term
in a month's time.

173
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,509
Bristlemoss School?

174
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,209
Does that mean
you're moving away?

175
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:42,613
Now, children, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

176
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:46,015
Your aunt really shouldn't have
told you about this

177
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:48,084
before discussing it
with your mother and me.

178
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:51,254
There's quite a few details
yet to iron out.

179
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:54,357
No, I have discussed it,
with Rose.

180
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,995
I was going to speak to you.
I just haven't had the chance.

181
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,738
William and I
will fund David's tuition.

182
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:10,106
Everything has been arranged.

183
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:15,412
You agreed to this?

184
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:18,582
I don't see why we must
make things harder on ourselves.

185
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:20,049
Jack.

186
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:23,921
- Rose, darling, let him go.
- Jack.

187
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,596
Do you know?

188
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:34,263
Boys who are away from home

189
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:37,568
still get presents
for their birthday.

190
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:41,605
My hat, you'll still make it
for me, won't you?

191
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:43,407
Of course.

192
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,187
It's an eagle feather.

193
00:15:59,322 --> 00:16:01,658
The most sacred
of all Indian symbols.

194
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,727
What does it stand for?

195
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,597
- Courage.
- Courage.

196
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,502
Well, we can all use a little
extra courage now and then.

197
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:17,273
<i>The Golden Key.</i> Again.

198
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:18,775
It's my favorite.

199
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,611
Oh, I know.

200
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:28,752
We need to check
for the monsters.

201
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:36,793
Found one.

202
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,399
- Good night, my loves.
- Good night.

203
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:03,085
I don't want you to go away.

204
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,058
How about I leave my shadow behind while I'm gone?

205
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:13,329
He's sillier than I am,

206
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:16,098
so you'll have to keep him
out of trouble.

207
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:17,568
- Deal?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,571
Not me. Him.

209
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:23,574
Deal.

210
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:34,685
Do people really forget
how to dream when they grow up?

211
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:37,186
Aunt Eleanor certainly has.

212
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:38,789
But have Mother and Father?

213
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:40,891
Why not?

214
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:43,627
I reckon some people
have extra dream dust

215
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,562
that can travel
out of the nursery windows

216
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,864
and be absorbed by grown-ups.

217
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:51,435
Should we open the window, then?
Just to be sure?

218
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,336
Great idea.

219
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:34,578
I saw the letter
from your teacher.

220
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,180
You're not to go outside today

221
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:39,716
until you've finished
your arithmetic.

222
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:42,619
All right?

223
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,628
- Morning.
- Morning.

224
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,771
- What's that?
- Uh...

225
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:03,740
List of supplies.

226
00:19:03,774 --> 00:19:07,778
- For old Mr. Brown's replica?
- That's exactly right.

227
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:09,980
I'm going into London today
to get them.

228
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:12,281
I might also catch
an old friend.

229
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:16,486
Will you be long?

230
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:21,458
No.

231
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,928
Toodle-oo, Peter.

232
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:44,313
Dishes and arithmetic.
What a dreadful day.

233
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:49,519
Why are you so good at this?

234
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:55,224
I can't do this.

235
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,663
No. That was nothing.

236
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:02,833
Oh, you've won.

237
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:06,536
Can we go and play
hide-and-seek now?

238
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:16,947
<i>The bustle of London</i>

239
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,716
<i>held an edge of mystery
in our minds.</i>

240
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:24,020
<i>We knew our father
had a life before us,</i>

241
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:26,923
<i>but what that life
had actually been...</i>

242
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,627
<i>We could scarcely imagine.</i>

243
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:33,864
Have you seen your dad?

244
00:20:35,397 --> 00:20:36,600
No.

245
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,835
The boss?

246
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:41,303
Uh, I've needed to stay away.

247
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:43,907
How is he?

248
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,942
He's still the boss, isn't he?

249
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:51,581
Have you ever thought of coming
by, for old times' sake?

250
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,317
We both know I can't.

251
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,791
How's the rest of your family?

252
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:04,961
My eldest son will soon be
leaving for Bristlemoss.

253
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:08,932
Oh. Will you look at that?
You must be proud.

254
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,637
Yeah. Suppose I am.

255
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:18,742
My own boy, Bristlemoss.

256
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:20,376
Who'd have thought it, eh?

257
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,781
I should get him something.

258
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:27,851
The boy deserves a gift
for an accomplishment like that,

259
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:29,385
doesn't he?

260
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,692
I found you.

261
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,794
You hardly gave me a challenge.

262
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:07,657
- Let me help.
- I don't need your help.

263
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:09,159
Mama will let you play
once you're done.

264
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:10,660
Leave me alone.

265
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:15,599
You were never planning on repairing
that boat with me, were you?

266
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:17,133
Of course I was.
I didn't know I'd get...

267
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,402
It doesn't matter.

268
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:22,005
Go to your stupid school.

269
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:24,174
You're just like
all the rest of them.

270
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:26,076
But not me.

271
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:28,612
No one will catch me
and make me a man.

272
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:33,416
Hard at work?

273
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:37,354
Uh, I just wanted to...

274
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:40,090
David?

275
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:48,131
For the man of the moment.

276
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,068
Well, open it.

277
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:57,841
It's just like...

278
00:22:57,874 --> 00:23:00,677
The one my father
gave to me, yes.

279
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:03,813
You never met your grandfather.

280
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:05,849
Um, he...

281
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,586
Had high hopes for me.

282
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:13,089
I'm afraid I never quite fulfilled them.

283
00:23:14,224 --> 00:23:18,461
But I want you to know
I'm proud of you, David.

284
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,809
All right, I'll let you
get back to it.

285
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:39,849
Give me that.

286
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:42,652
We'll still have time
for adventures before I leave.

287
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:44,821
What are you doing?

288
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:13,717
Pirates.
This could be dangerous.

289
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,887
You can retreat if you want.

290
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:20,557
Go back if you want,
Bristlemoss boy.

291
00:24:21,257 --> 00:24:22,659
I'm not scared.

292
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:23,927
Neither am I.

293
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:28,631
One... Two...

294
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,200
Three.

295
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,641
I know you're here!

296
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:41,711
Come out and fight!

297
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:43,713
Come here!

298
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:45,849
I'll fight all the pirates
in the sea.

299
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:51,888
Yah!

300
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:54,758
Behind you!

301
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,667
Up above!

302
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:08,905
Well done, David!

303
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:13,610
Yay!

304
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:15,311
Whoo!

305
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:33,997
David!

306
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,251
Argh!

307
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:23,806
I miss David.

308
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:42,959
- Did you see that?
- What?

309
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:44,994
That's it.

310
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:48,231
We were playing hide-and-seek
and now he wants me to find him.

311
00:27:48,264 --> 00:27:49,433
Alice.

312
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:52,835
He's gone.

313
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,039
He's gone,
and it's because of me.

314
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:57,740
Peter, please.

315
00:28:52,395 --> 00:28:54,565
<i>You can retreat
if you want.</i>

316
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:57,400
<i>Go back if you want,
Bristlemoss boy.</i>

317
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:05,275
No, Alice.

318
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:12,215
Mama?

319
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:14,250
Go and play.

320
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:21,090
What are you doing?

321
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:24,461
Making a hat for David,
as I promised.

322
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:31,834
Did you hear that, Tink?

323
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:35,572
She's making him a hat.
He will come back.

324
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,843
There we are.

325
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:43,012
Why isn't Mama tucking us in?

326
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:45,582
I want Mama.

327
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,418
Your mother needs her rest.

328
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:59,195
Come on, then.
Let's read a story.

329
00:29:59,228 --> 00:30:03,066
Goody! Tell us the story
about the orphanage.

330
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:05,935
Let's see.

331
00:30:07,404 --> 00:30:09,972
I think this is the right one.

332
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,277
"Long ago,

333
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,280
<i>"in a faraway land,</i>

334
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:20,316
<i>"there was an orphanage.</i>

335
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,620
<i>"By day, the children did
as they were told.</i>

336
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:26,856
<i>"They studied hard.</i>

337
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:30,494
<i>"They worked hard.</i>

338
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:37,266
<i>"And they never, ever
played games.</i>

339
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,407
<i>"But at night,</i>

340
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:47,176
<i>"when they were left alone,</i>

341
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,181
<i>"their golden dream dust
would fill the room</i>

342
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:55,985
<i>"and take them far, far away,</i>

343
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:58,555
<i>"and no matter how he tried,</i>

344
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:00,557
<i>"their keeper
couldn't stop them</i>

345
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:04,360
<i>"from escaping
into their dreams."</i>

346
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:06,463
<i>'Cause being a grown-up,</i>

347
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,232
<i>he had forgotten
how to dream long ago.</i>

348
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,938
Peter, whatever's the matter
with you?

349
00:31:15,972 --> 00:31:20,343
I think I'm getting too old
for bedtime stories, that's all.

350
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:22,378
Good night.

351
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:26,282
Off to bed.

352
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:52,108
Peter.

353
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:22,606
<i>I don't want you
to go away.</i>

354
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:46,730
<i>No one will catch me
and make me a man.</i>

355
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:32,576
<i>We'll be
the Lost Boys of the wild.</i>

356
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:41,250
Catch us if you can!

357
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:45,822
Wait for me!

358
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:51,394
You'll never catch us!
We're the Lost Boys of the wild!

359
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:54,196
Wait!

360
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,109
Hello?

361
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:10,814
Hello?

362
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:18,455
Rose?

363
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:27,196
Mmm.

364
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:34,738
Rose?

365
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:27,591
Charlie.

366
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:31,461
Oh, Jack,
I'm sorry about your son.

367
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:32,696
Deal me in.

368
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,468
I said deal me in.

369
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:42,873
Give me your cards.

370
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,776
You too.

371
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:22,311
Well, you certainly
seem to be enjoying yourself.

372
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:26,850
What makes you think
you can come in here

373
00:36:26,883 --> 00:36:28,885
and play these tables, hmm?

374
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,721
My debts were cleared away
years ago.

375
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:31,955
Is that so?

376
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,826
Just had a bad run,
fellas.

377
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:38,360
My luck is bound to turn
in good time.

378
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,433
Look, all right.

379
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:47,604
Give this to that boss of yours.

380
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,444
Tell him he knows
I'm good for it, all right?

381
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,851
I'm sure he's gonna love this.

382
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:06,223
Rose?

383
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:10,494
Rose?

384
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,996
Rose,
haven't you heard a word I've said?

385
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:20,537
Actually...

386
00:37:23,473 --> 00:37:26,810
I'd like you to come and stay
with William and me for a while.

387
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:28,945
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

388
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:31,014
I just don't understand.

389
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,318
Until you're a mother,
you never will.

390
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:40,023
I see.

391
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,828
Never mind.

392
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:48,598
<i>My mother seemed to be lost.</i>

393
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:52,769
<i>I couldn't reach her.</i>

394
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:57,607
<i>So I reached for a heart
I could touch instead.</i>

395
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:59,676
Would you like some tea?

396
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:05,081
We would be ever so grateful
for the company.

397
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:13,089
Thank you.

398
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:24,768
Oh. Uh.

399
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:56,666
Would you like to see
a real teahouse?

400
00:39:18,788 --> 00:39:21,591
Mmm.
Thank you so much.

401
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:41,978
Are you enjoying yourself?

402
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:45,782
Ah, you have a...

403
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,753
Yes, a little bit
of cream just...

404
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:52,889
A little bit lower.

405
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,662
Almost gone.

406
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,432
Ah! Isn't this nice?

407
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:07,904
It's a shame we haven't spent
much time together before.

408
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:10,607
You really are a lovely girl.

409
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,076
I'm not a girl. I'm a lady.

410
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:15,512
Then I think you should know,

411
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:18,915
a lady never rests her elbows
on the table.

412
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:28,458
A lady also only crosses
her legs at the ankles.

413
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,931
Oh, you poor thing.

414
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,801
You just want to be brought up
in a civilized manner.

415
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:39,235
Is that not so?

416
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:45,141
You need my help, and my help
is what you're going to get.

417
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:48,611
A lady should never gnaw
on her fingernails.

418
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:51,848
It is a disgusting habit
of the lower class.

419
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:56,152
And just because your father
is from that class,

420
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:59,823
it does not mean
that you have to be too.

421
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:02,258
We will make a lady of you yet.

422
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,135
It's perfect.

423
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,939
It was the last thing
I promised him.

424
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,241
I know.

425
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:29,586
I have news.

426
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:42,165
Peter, that is wonderful.

427
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:43,566
Oh, my.

428
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,235
I want to take David's place,

429
00:41:46,736 --> 00:41:48,038
at Bristlemoss.

430
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,840
I can make you proud too.

431
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:55,578
Peter, you've always
made us proud.

432
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:01,851
- Stay back.
- No, no, no.

433
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:04,154
I told you
to pay your debt, Littleton!

434
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:08,825
Everyone all right?

435
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:24,707
Rose, I can explain.

436
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:26,209
We need to send for the police.

437
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:28,845
No, no. He's got the police
in his pocket.

438
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:31,881
Why? Why?
After all these years?

439
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:34,851
- You know what he's like.
- I'll pay it off.

440
00:42:34,884 --> 00:42:37,220
Once I finish <i>The Golden Hind</i>
for Mr. Brown,

441
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:39,956
we'll have enough
to pay off my debt.

442
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,958
- Rose...
- Finish it, then.

443
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:44,194
- Rose. Rose.
- Finish it. Hannah.

444
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:47,964
Children.

445
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:03,346
What are you doing?

446
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:09,786
Alice, go back to sleep.

447
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:12,789
Peter.

448
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:24,167
What happened tonight,
the trouble Father's in,

449
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:28,304
it never would have happened
if David were here.

450
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,676
And if it had, he wouldn't have
stood by and watched.

451
00:43:37,113 --> 00:43:38,281
Wait.

452
00:43:40,283 --> 00:43:41,951
I want to help.

453
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,022
Alice, get down.

454
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,342
Evening, sweetheart.

455
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:41,244
Can you spare any pennies?

456
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:44,481
Oh, I've had enough
of this.

457
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,249
I'm going for an ale.

458
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,958
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't take any myself.

459
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,302
- Oi! Watch it!
- Go, go, go!

460
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,806
- Oi!
- Oi!

461
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,175
- Out of the way!
- Hurry up! He's coming!

462
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:14,944
Hurry up! Come on!

463
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:21,150
Get back here!
You dirty little vermin!

464
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:23,853
- Run! Go!
- Move, you sop!

465
00:45:25,288 --> 00:45:28,091
Wait till I get my hands on you,
you rats!

466
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:33,296
Hurry up!
Get out of the way!

467
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:35,832
D'you hear me?
You little scum!

468
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,208
Alice, go!

469
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:47,877
You little toerag!

470
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:02,392
If I get my hands on you...
I'm gonna kill you!

471
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:08,532
Why are you following us?

472
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,534
'Cause of you we lost the loot.

473
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:11,934
You mean this?

474
00:46:18,274 --> 00:46:21,244
Would you happen to know the way
to the pawn shop?

475
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:37,528
This is where we leave you.

476
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,028
You're not coming?

477
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,464
We've got business at the Row.

478
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:51,442
How can we repay you?

479
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,121
Hello?

480
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:40,289
Is anyone there?

481
00:47:40,323 --> 00:47:42,358
Children, children!

482
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:46,195
Games and games,
and what are your names, hmm?

483
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:48,297
- Peter.
- Peter...

484
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:49,966
- Little...
- Pan.

485
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:54,137
Peter Pan and Tiger Lily.

486
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:57,106
Can you answer me a riddle?

487
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,443
- I love riddles.
- She loves riddles.

488
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:04,113
How is a raven like...

489
00:48:05,114 --> 00:48:07,451
A writing desk? Hmm?

490
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,686
How is a raven
like a writing desk?

491
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,655
How much will you give me
for this?

492
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,636
Must you sell it?

493
00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:33,042
Hmm! Let us all move
one pace on.

494
00:49:02,271 --> 00:49:03,407
Thank you.

495
00:49:22,124 --> 00:49:23,993
Alice, look.

496
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,368
What do you have for me?

497
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,260
Have you guessed
the riddle yet?

498
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:06,597
No. What's the answer?

499
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,098
I haven't
the slightest idea.

500
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,367
Ooh. May I?

501
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,404
Your hair wants cutting.

502
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,539
Father!

503
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,547
We've got guests.

504
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,383
Customers, yes, yes, we know.

505
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,320
What are your names, then?

506
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,890
- Peter Pan.
- I'm Tiger Lily.

507
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,726
Indeed.

508
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,465
And you can call me...

509
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:44,868
CJ.

510
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,178
It's quite
an extraordinary piece.

511
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,716
And the inscription is...

512
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:02,351
Somewhat...

513
00:52:05,354 --> 00:52:06,690
Personal.

514
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:09,158
It was a gift from our father.

515
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,697
Complicated, aren't they?

516
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,203
Fathers.

517
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:29,746
Are you sure you're
willing to part with him?

518
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,181
What?

519
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:42,258
I said are you sure you're
willing to part with it?

520
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,694
We need to sell it.

521
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,840
Well, then,

522
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,311
let's do business.

523
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,756
We did it. We really did it.

524
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,494
I can't wait to see Papa's face
in the morning.

525
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,073
<i>I've often
wondered when it was</i>

526
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,677
<i>that my brother and I
were set on different paths.</i>

527
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,449
<i>We were wounded
by the same hurts.</i>

528
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,352
Alice, wake up.

529
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:55,559
<i>Soothed by the same lullabies.</i>

530
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,464
<i>Was there a single moment
when we diverged?</i>

531
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,059
You're standing
on my foot!

532
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:43,372
The Lost Boys at your service.
We want you to come with us.

533
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,900
Where did you get this?

534
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,063
Alice, what are you doing?

535
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:16,633
I told you always to knock.

536
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,034
I'm sorry, Mama.

537
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:21,471
What does your potion do?

538
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:26,576
Never you mind.
This is not for children.

539
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,245
It is not ever for children.

540
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,749
I'm not a child.
I'm a young lady.

541
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,952
I know all about
how a lady acts.

542
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:39,923
For instance, nail biting
is unacceptable for a lady.

543
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,625
It's a disgusting habit
of the lower class.

544
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:43,626
The lower class?

545
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,096
Just because Father
is of that class does not...

546
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:51,134
Don't you ever speak
of your father that way. Ever!

547
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:55,939
Go to your room.

548
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,690
<i>Take me away from here,
Tinker Bell.</i>

549
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,660
I know you're a real fairy.

550
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,729
You can show yourself to me.

551
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,631
It's safe.

552
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,878
<i>Tink, please.</i>

553
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:48,958
Tink?

554
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,836
I'm so sorry, Tink.

555
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,239
<i>Mr. Littleton, sir.</i>

556
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,108
Oh, thank you, Wells.

557
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,779
Jack, good to see you.

558
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:11,681
Mr. Brown.

559
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:17,353
Uh, please, can I interest you
in some mock turtle soup?

560
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,222
Oh, no. No, thank you, sir.

561
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,291
No. Wise man.

562
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,928
What can I do for you?

563
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,363
Well, I know it took longer
than we discussed,

564
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:32,268
but the replica you commissioned
has been completed, sir.

565
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:39,809
Oh, that is exquisite.

566
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:43,079
Your work never ceases
to impress, Jack.

567
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:46,149
But this particular replica

568
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:49,819
was meant as a birthday gift
for my grandson.

569
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:51,988
Shall I inscribe it, sir?

570
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:56,025
His birthday
was over a week ago.

571
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,395
I heard word of what happened
to your son. I'm so sorry.

572
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:04,234
I sent Wells to inquire,
but you were never at home.

573
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:08,037
You see, I had no choice
but to hire...

574
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:11,674
Another craftsman
to do the job.

575
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:16,045
I'm sure you can understand.

576
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,321
Yes.

577
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,960
Yes, of course.

578
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,832
Thank you, sir.

579
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,782
Yes?

580
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,003
I'm sorry for what I said.

581
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:37,794
I slapped Alice.

582
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,397
Rose, how could you?

583
01:01:41,432 --> 01:01:44,300
The way she looked at me, Ellie.

584
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,040
I just haven't
been myself since...

585
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:55,512
I just...

586
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:58,482
I just wanted to hold onto him,
just a little longer.

587
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:09,526
Now there's everything
with Jack.

588
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,895
What about Jack?
What's happened?

589
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,501
Noth...
I shouldn't have mentioned...

590
01:02:18,602 --> 01:02:20,803
I just...

591
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:23,574
For God's sake, Rose,
stop biting your nails.

592
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:25,842
I haven't seen you bite your
nails since you were a girl.

593
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,478
It's the most disgusting
habit of the lower class

594
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:28,878
and you know that.

595
01:02:32,015 --> 01:02:34,884
And just because Jack
is of that class,

596
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,853
it doesn't mean we have to be.

597
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,391
Is that what you said
to my daughter?

598
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,828
He's her father, Ellie.

599
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,565
Rose, listen to me,
you have to understand...

600
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:49,899
Rose.

601
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,598
I knew he'd leave me a clue.

602
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:48,625
All children have been
to Neverland.

603
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:51,327
But most of them
lose their Neverlands forever

604
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:54,631
when they get all...
All growed up.

605
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:57,434
Their heads get filled
with all kinds of muck.

606
01:03:57,468 --> 01:03:58,968
Like neckties.

607
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:02,105
And taxidermies.

608
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:05,341
- Most children?
- Most, but not all.

609
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,578
Have you ever heard
of dream dust?

610
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:09,145
<i>Dream dust?</i>

611
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:32,669
<i>Dream dust is the stuff
that makes us remember.</i>

612
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:35,938
<i>It's the reason you can
build sandcastles in the sky.</i>

613
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,456
<i>Or take a voyage
to the moon.</i>

614
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:54,123
<i>All right.</i>

615
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:56,392
But what does that
have to do with me?

616
01:04:56,427 --> 01:05:00,431
You have more dream dust
than anyone we've ever seen.

617
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,734
You never have to grow up.

618
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:07,003
Come to Neverland with us, Pan,
and be a boy forever.

619
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,971
I have to grow up, Nibs.

620
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:15,044
My family, all their
expectations lie in me now.

621
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:19,182
Don't you see? It isn't
their expectations inside you.

622
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,651
It's their dreams.

623
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,785
<i>What does your potion do?</i>

624
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:39,530
Please, potion,
take me away from here.

625
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,732
Make me disappear.

626
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,274
Papa?

627
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:47,564
Here.

628
01:07:47,598 --> 01:07:50,467
You can use it
to pay off those men.

629
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,707
How did you get this?

630
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:02,479
This is not your burden to bear.

631
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:05,281
Peter, you're...
You're not to worry.

632
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:08,752
Don't you understand?
Everything's all right now.

633
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:13,757
That's what you needed,
and I got it for you.

634
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,463
Where did you get this?

635
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,264
No.

636
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:29,773
Where did you get this?
Answer me!

637
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:32,809
Peter.

638
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,378
Peter.

639
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,790
Peter!

640
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:49,793
Peter?

641
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,597
Let me take care of this.

642
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,434
This is my problem,
not yours.

643
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:00,403
Peter.

644
01:09:04,775 --> 01:09:05,942
Peter.

645
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:10,346
Peter?

646
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:22,693
If you're here, come out.

647
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,330
I want to come with you.

648
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:32,502
<i>The bond between
my brothers was deep and true.</i>

649
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,975
<i>But not all brothers
are as lucky,</i>

650
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,714
<i>and when fathers
divide their sons...</i>

651
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:45,849
Hello, Father.

652
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:48,552
<i>...it can
all go terribly wrong.</i>

653
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:49,619
My boy!

654
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,424
Oh!

655
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,560
James, look here.

656
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:02,364
This is my son Jack,

657
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,534
home from university.

658
01:10:05,469 --> 01:10:07,537
Tell Margaret to come down...

659
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:10,306
And put the kettle on.

660
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:11,942
- Come, come, come.
- I'm alright. I'm alright.

661
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:14,310
Sit. Sit.

662
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:17,246
- He's a bit slow.
- Enough!

663
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,285
I don't have the money, James.

664
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:26,656
I need more time.

665
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:31,661
After 12 years,
that's all you have to say?

666
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,601
Have a drink
with your brother, Jack.

667
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,401
We'll discuss business later.

668
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:43,673
Bottoms up.

669
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:54,383
Your leftover brats,
they're wilier than I expected,

670
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,486
for two pampered little toffs.

671
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:01,357
They showed up.
Can you imagine?

672
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:06,429
Two little mice traipsing
into the mouth of a crocodile.

673
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:08,364
And you were gentle with 'em.

674
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:10,467
I appreciate that.

675
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,569
They're my flesh and blood,
Jack.

676
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,739
Not all of us
betray our families.

677
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:20,309
Plus, they came
bearing treasures

678
01:11:21,411 --> 01:11:22,679
from a long forgotten past.

679
01:11:23,547 --> 01:11:24,815
"To our son, with pride."

680
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:28,652
Touching as ever.

681
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:33,790
So, right back where we began.

682
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:39,696
I was a lost man, Father.

683
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:43,767
I had to get away. I had to.

684
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,603
And yet
here you are again.

685
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,338
Perhaps this is where
you always belonged.

686
01:11:51,942 --> 01:11:53,543
I'm nothing like you.

687
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,980
Father.

688
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:01,618
Go lay down, Father.

689
01:12:02,953 --> 01:12:05,555
Yes. I'll go lay down.

690
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:17,167
I'll get you
the money soon, all right?

691
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,401
The rules never really
did apply to you,

692
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:21,805
- did they, little Jack?
- I just need some more time.

693
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,907
Always an arrogant
little snob.

694
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:28,478
I lost my son, James.
I lost my son.

695
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,713
Please.

696
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,117
Please.

697
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:37,420
I'm still your brother.

698
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:43,960
Well, then, brother...

699
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:49,099
For once in your life,

700
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:53,603
you shall pay your debt.

701
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:05,715
<i>Rose!</i>

702
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:09,419
He crushed my hand.

703
01:13:13,256 --> 01:13:16,026
All I did was
ask for more time.

704
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:20,830
I'll kill him.

705
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:23,566
I'll kill him.

706
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:28,538
Off with his head.

707
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:32,575
<i>Don't you ever speak
of your father that way, ever!</i>

708
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:35,512
Darling?

709
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,581
Alice?

710
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:40,850
Leave me alone.

711
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:43,954
We need
to get a doctor.

712
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:45,722
I'll get the doctor.

713
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:50,060
Peter.

714
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:54,030
We've always been alike.

715
01:13:54,064 --> 01:13:57,534
A little bit lighter
than the world will allow.

716
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,736
Don't let life drag you down.

717
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:06,009
You just keep floating above it,
long as you can.

718
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,243
You promise?

719
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:12,615
Peter... You promise?

720
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,588
I promise.

721
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,770
She's upstairs.

722
01:14:42,946 --> 01:14:44,280
Leave me alone.

723
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:48,651
My mother's not in here.

724
01:14:49,586 --> 01:14:51,254
I didn't come for your mother.

725
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:53,923
I came for you.

726
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:56,693
Look.

727
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:12,776
Rose, darling, how's Jack?

728
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:15,779
They took
his hand, Eleanor.

729
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,648
He's a craftsman.
He can't work.

730
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,750
I want you to know
that William and I

731
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:23,053
will do anything we can
to help you

732
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:25,722
until Jack
is back on his feet again.

733
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,724
Under one condition.

734
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:31,227
Alice comes with me.

735
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,067
Get out.

736
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,935
I'll raise her properly, Rose,

737
01:15:38,968 --> 01:15:42,872
see that she's well-groomed
and well married.

738
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:44,674
Leave my house.

739
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:48,244
Even if I do,

740
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:52,715
I can't promise
that she'll stay away from me.

741
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:55,885
You see, darling,
it was Alice that suggested it.

742
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:00,957
Leave.

743
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:04,961
- Get out, Eleanor.
- Rose.

744
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:06,296
Get out.

745
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:09,799
It's for the best.

746
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:12,035
You will see
it's for the best.

747
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:24,247
What's that?

748
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:33,790
I thought you might like
to have your things up here.

749
01:16:37,428 --> 01:16:38,895
Here, let me help.

750
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,064
No, no, no. Peter.

751
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,174
It's over now.

752
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:54,978
No one
is going to bother us now.

753
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:56,980
Not my brother, not anyone.

754
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:00,350
It's over.

755
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:02,919
It's over.

756
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:18,935
CJ did that to Father, Alice.

757
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,770
- He's our uncle.
- What?

758
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,705
CJ's our uncle.

759
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,075
Our own family did this to us.

760
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:27,810
Let go of me.

761
01:17:29,179 --> 01:17:30,947
He's going to pay,

762
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:33,883
and I know how, too.

763
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,423
No, Peter, you can't.

764
01:17:39,456 --> 01:17:41,791
They'll come after you.

765
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:46,296
Which is why I won't be able
to come back. Not ever.

766
01:17:48,031 --> 01:17:49,699
Come with me.

767
01:18:00,143 --> 01:18:02,011
I'm going to live
with Aunt Eleanor.

768
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:03,313
Aunt Eleanor?

769
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:07,150
She'll turn you into a lady.

770
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:10,353
You won't be able to play
or make up stories.

771
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:12,855
It's time for me to grow up.

772
01:18:19,463 --> 01:18:25,068
And this tinker's bell
was born for you.

773
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:27,830
<i>The Red Queen does not
tolerate disobedience.</i>

774
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:29,332
<i>Off with your head.</i>

775
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:33,537
<i>We will make a lady
of you yet.</i>

776
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,009
Alice!

777
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:48,985
It's not time to grow up, Alice.

778
01:19:51,455 --> 01:19:53,156
It never is.

779
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:56,427
Peter?

780
01:19:57,428 --> 01:19:58,895
You'll see.

781
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:15,011
<i>I shall be too late.</i>

782
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:36,265
<i>Long ago, in a faraway land,</i>

783
01:20:38,569 --> 01:20:40,437
<i>there was a family.</i>

784
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:45,409
<i>By day, the children did
as they were told,</i>

785
01:20:50,681 --> 01:20:54,618
<i>and in the innermost places
of their hearts,</i>

786
01:20:54,651 --> 01:20:58,087
<i>they worried about
what it might mean to grow up.</i>

787
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:19,275
<i>But at night, when their
hearts lay still and sleeping,</i>

788
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:24,448
<i>their golden dream dust
filled the room</i>

789
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:28,985
<i>and took them far, far away.</i>

790
01:22:02,486 --> 01:22:04,020
Come home.

791
01:22:30,481 --> 01:22:32,649
Catch me if you can.

792
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:07,276
<i>I was
only a visitor in Wonderland.</i>

793
01:24:09,913 --> 01:24:12,482
<i>Take care of Peter, Tink.</i>

794
01:24:14,183 --> 01:24:17,554
<i>But Peter
was born to be Pan.</i>

795
01:24:29,633 --> 01:24:31,568
It's brilliant.

796
01:24:47,851 --> 01:24:50,152
Oh, my baby.

797
01:24:59,195 --> 01:25:01,465
- I love you.
- I love you too.

798
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:41,404
<i>We always knew
when he'd been to visit...</i>

799
01:25:43,974 --> 01:25:47,276
<i>Because he'd leave us
a piece of his adventures.</i>

800
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:04,594
Rose?

801
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:08,665
<i>The world fresh</i>

802
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:12,201
<i>and full of possibilities
once again.</i>

803
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:23,980
"For he comes, human child

804
01:26:24,014 --> 01:26:26,516
"To the woods and waters wild

805
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:30,587
"With a faery, hand in hand

806
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:34,791
"for the world's more full of
weeping than he can understand."

807
01:26:44,634 --> 01:26:46,870
Mama, what's wrong?

808
01:26:52,943 --> 01:26:54,444
Nothing, Wendy.

809
01:26:56,079 --> 01:26:57,614
Nothing at all.

810
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,885
You look lovely, Alice.

811
01:27:31,915 --> 01:27:34,818
<i>I don't remember
the way to the rabbit hole,</i>

812
01:27:37,654 --> 01:27:40,757
<i>or the smell
of Neverland's shores...</i>

813
01:27:57,007 --> 01:27:59,442
<i>But because of my brothers,</i>

814
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:05,448
<i>I haven't forgotten
