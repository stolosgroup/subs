[blues song playing on radio]

6
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,100
You said a man wants to see me.

7
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:14,683
Alley out back.

8
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:21,308
He can't come in here?
What is he, white? [scoffs]

9
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,308
Oh, boy. Man.

10
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,517
Who is he?

11
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,933
Never met him before,

12
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:30,475
but he said his boss
was looking

13
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:32,558
for a reliable guy
to do some work.

14
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:33,850
Who's his boss, Jimmy?

15
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,267
No one I knew.

16
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,892
But I heard you were looking
for something quick.

17
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,308
See, I thought
we were cool, man.

18
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:42,850
[Jimmy] Mmm-hmm.

19
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,517
And now you're gonna bring me
into some sketchy shit?

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,808
Yeah.

21
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:47,225
Well, you're lucky
anybody's calling

22
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:49,433
after that Gotham Hotel mess.

23
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,267
Now, I get my fee
no matter what.

24
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,725
Just go hear the man out.

25
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,642
Give me your Roscoe.

26
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:05,475
Curtis, now that's...
Curtis. Curtis.

27
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:09,475
See? Trouble.

28
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:10,517
[gun clicks]

29
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,100
Just trouble.

30
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,517
You Curt?

31
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,975
[Curt] Who are you?

32
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,725
Jones.

33
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:49,892
You work for Frank?

34
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:53,475
[Jones] I've done work
for Frank. This is not Frank.

35
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,017
Okay, 'cause if he's in,
I'm out.

36
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,683
What did I just tell you?

37
00:03:58,058 --> 00:03:59,267
Watkins?

38
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,558
[chuckles softly]

39
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,100
Do I look like I work
for Aldrick Watkins?

40
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,017
So what's the score?

41
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:27,225
We're sending a man
that works in an office

42
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,058
to pick something up
from that office

43
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:31,350
and bring it back to his home.

44
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,600
You are part of
a babysitting team

45
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:38,225
watching his family while
he does it. No one gets hurt.

46
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:40,558
Three hours of work.

47
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:45,058
For this, I'm offering
you two grand now,

48
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,892
and three on the other end.

49
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:51,725
For three hours?

50
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:54,600
They said that your number
was five grand.

51
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:57,183
Is this something
you think you can do?

52
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,100
[Vanessa] Then he
calls me an opportunist,

53
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:02,100
like being married to him
is some kind of opportunity.

54
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:04,725
When he's out doing,
you know, whatever.

55
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,600
You know how he gets.

56
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:12,725
Well, you used to, and it is
way worse, now that he's fancy.

57
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:14,892
Do you think
I'm a schemer, Ronald?

58
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:18,350
I think you have
ulterior motives.

59
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,517
But I find that sexy.

60
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:25,267
[Vanessa] Oh, I get it.

61
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,350
So, this is my scheme, is it?

62
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:31,850
Don't kid yourself, Ronald.

63
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:35,100
We both know who
you're really fucking here.

64
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,100
How could you say that?

65
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:42,683
Oh, and that's another thing
that ticks me off.

66
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:45,225
How many times a week
do I put on this dress?

67
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:46,600
And he has yet to notice

68
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:48,308
I couldn't hit a tennis ball
to save my life.

69
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:50,933
I can't reward
that kind of inattentiveness.

70
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:53,725
I simply will not.

71
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,267
[sighs]

72
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,392
You look cute.

73
00:05:58,808 --> 00:05:59,767
Come here.

74
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:02,267
Oh. [giggles]

75
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:04,808
Mmm. Lipstick.

76
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,475
Do you love me?

77
00:06:09,558 --> 00:06:11,725
Of course I love you, Ronald.

78
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,267
You better.

79
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:26,142
Psst.

80
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,392
[softly] Hey.

81
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,433
We're almost there, okay?

82
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:35,808
I'll be calling you.

83
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:06,767
[knocking on door]

84
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:21,975
Where's the fire? It's five of.

85
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:25,433
[Jones] Really?
My watch must be fast.

86
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:28,975
Well?

87
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,767
Close the door behind you.

88
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,642
Imagine my surprise
when I got your call.

89
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,058
Self-interest is the
sincerest form of flattery.

90
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,100
They want you, Ronald,

91
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:53,767
much as I mighta tried
to dissuade them.

92
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,100
Then are you gonna
tell me who they are?

93
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:58,683
Because this "Outfit outta
Chicago" ain't gonna do it.

94
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:00,433
No, they're not prepared
to do that.

95
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,350
If Frank is involved,
you can let yourself out the door.

96
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:09,475
Everyone has a problem
with Frank these days.

97
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:10,600
Who's "everyone"?

98
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:13,850
For our purposes, no one.

99
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:17,475
Look, they agreed
to match your price.

100
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:22,392
Three grand up front,
4,500 upon completion.

101
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:24,767
[sighs]

102
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,392
What's this?

103
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:35,142
What?

104
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:38,308
You think I'd be
all right with that?

105
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,808
Maybe that's how they do things
in Chicago now. But not here.

106
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:43,517
All right, give me
that envelope back.

107
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,058
I'm gonna find someone else.

108
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:52,267
He sits up front.

109
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,767
You're not gonna get stabbed
in the neck, Ronald.

110
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,308
I like to sit in the back.

111
00:08:56,392 --> 00:08:57,725
So sit in the back.

112
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:13,142
Mister, you mind
sitting up front?

113
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:15,392
I do.

114
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:21,933
I'd like to sit in the back.

115
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:24,850
[Jones] This is ridiculous.
We're wasting time.

116
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,017
Be my guest.

117
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:38,225
[Jones] Curt, meet Ronald.
Ronald, Curt.

118
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,017
The other man's inside.

119
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,558
Now there's another man?

120
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:50,975
It's a three-man job.

121
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,350
You never said that.

122
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,975
He said we wasn't
gonna be working alone.

123
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:57,392
So who's this fucking guy?

124
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:58,392
Charley.

125
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:00,267
Not that guy. This fucking guy.

126
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,725
And who the fuck is Charley?

127
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:04,058
Like you, I'm meeting
'em both today, too.

128
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:10,350
[Charley] Do we need
to go over anything?

129
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:13,058
[Ronald] Instructions seemed
pretty clear to me.

130
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:14,767
Ask Sambo.

131
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:18,392
Name's Curt.

132
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:21,558
Like he told you
in the car. [spits]

133
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:22,975
You're Curt Goynes.

134
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:26,933
You didn't hear about this guy?

135
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,392
[Ronald] Why would I?

136
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,308
I don't know anybody
that knows him.

137
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:31,308
[Curt] Hmm.

138
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:33,892
Well, you know Frank.

139
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,725
Frank who?

140
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:38,308
No. Frank Capelli.

141
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:42,475
How do you know Frank Capelli?

142
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,683
[Curt] I met him once, briefly.

143
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:46,267
Oh.

144
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,933
Yeah, and if you're Ronald,

145
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:50,350
then you got to
be Ronald Russo,

146
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,892
'cause you sure as hell
match the description.

147
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:54,850
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

148
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:56,308
[Curt chuckles]

149
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,975
You seem worried about
how you might be described.

150
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:01,142
Let's be clear,

151
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,683
the only thing
I'm worried about

152
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,933
is this thing getting fucked up
because of you.

153
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:05,933
[spits]

154
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:07,350
What's that supposed to mean?

155
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:10,142
It's not your fault.

156
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,933
You were born like that.

157
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:14,058
Born like what?

158
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,308
[Charley] Okay.

159
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:17,267
All right. This isn't why
we were hired.

160
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,767
And who did hire us,
Charley, huh?

161
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,100
You gonna tell me straight up

162
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,767
this ain't some
Frank Capelli production?

163
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,017
No. No, no, no, no.

164
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,142
It's, uh, some outfit
out of Illinois,

165
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:31,808
wants to expand to Detroit.

166
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,308
The guy pitched it like

167
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,683
"get in on the ground floor"
kind of thing.

168
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:40,308
They grow their presence and we have an in.
Kind of thing.

169
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:45,600
What's with the fucking eye?

170
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,683
Sometimes when people lie,

171
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:53,600
they tend to over-explain.
Kind of thing.

172
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,517
[Charley] So he's been
running numbers for Watkins,

173
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,975
but then decides that he wants
a little bit of his own turf.

174
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:04,600
And Watkins stakes him,
like, 25 g's.

175
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:08,017
But Goynes wants
a bigger score.

176
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,058
Exactly. They always do.

177
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,308
They're never satisfied.

178
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:15,767
So he goes to the Italians

179
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,808
and he sets up this big meeting
at the Gotham.

180
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:19,517
And he wants to play
them off each other.

181
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,183
You know, the blacks
and the Italians.

182
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:25,058
But Watkins gets tipped off

183
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:28,017
and things get
really fucking ugly.

184
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,600
Both sides lose people,

185
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,725
Watkins loses his 25k.

186
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:33,558
And both blame Goynes.

187
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:38,142
But not for the deaths because
that's, you know... people.

188
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,517
The big thing?

189
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:45,683
Watkins' code book
goes missing.

190
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:50,142
Every bet, every debt,
every bribe, every payoff.

191
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:52,933
The real names.
Ten years' worth.

192
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:56,433
So he has Watkins'
code book, huh?

193
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:58,392
[Charley] That gets
out in the open,

194
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,475
everybody's going down.

195
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,100
Cologne again.

196
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:45,017
[Matt] Hmm? Oh, yes.

197
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,933
Mary. Yes, I do.
I sometimes wear cologne.

198
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:53,142
Maybe it covers up
the other odors.

199
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:55,642
- [clanging]
- Yeah. Sure. Maybe that's it.

200
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:57,808
[clanging]

201
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:02,600
So I was awake for
a while last night.

202
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:05,642
How is that news?

203
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:08,017
[Matt] That is not news.

204
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,308
[Mary] <i>Matthew?</i>

205
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,267
Mattie?

206
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,392
There's no clean socks.

207
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:14,808
Just borrow some
from your father.

208
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:16,225
Dad's are too big.

209
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:18,475
They're not that big.

210
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,267
[Mary] Peg, you need help
tying those?

211
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,267
No.

212
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,642
You sure?
'Cause I can...

213
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:23,892
I don't need help.

214
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:25,475
Okay. Amy's coming early

215
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:27,267
so you can set up
show and tell.

216
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,517
I know.

217
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:56,183
Good morning.

218
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:57,392
[Mary gasps]

219
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:58,850
[Charley] Hey, shh, shh, shh.

220
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,100
- [Mary whimpers]
- Don't.

221
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:01,517
Shh, shh, shh.

222
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,225
This is a typical morning.
Nothing changes. Okay?

223
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:09,350
Now, what would you do now,

224
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:12,517
normal Monday?

225
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,017
I would make breakfast.

226
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:19,683
[Ronald]
Well, there you go then.

227
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:23,517
What do you want?

228
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,808
[Charley] Is that something
you'd say, normal Monday?

229
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:31,308
I don't know.

230
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,100
[breath trembling]

231
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:40,058
Can I just... Can I just...
Oh, God. Oh, God. Thank you.

232
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,933
[footsteps approaching]

233
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,183
[breathing nervously]

234
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,767
Mom. Mom?

235
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,558
Go ahead. Move.

236
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,100
[Mary] It's okay, Matthew.

237
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,933
[gun clicks]

238
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:07,850
[Charley] Hi, kiddo.

239
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,142
[Ronald] Good morning.

240
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:15,892
[snickers]

241
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:20,100
Everything is normal, Matthew,

242
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:23,642
exactly like any other Monday.
Except...

243
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,600
So, have a seat.

244
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,517
It's fine.
Go ahead, sit down.

245
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:42,683
[Mary] It's okay. It's okay.

246
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:50,017
[Ronald] So, Matthew...

247
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,808
are you a Sugar Smacks guy
or a Trix guy?

248
00:16:56,892 --> 00:17:01,225
Can you please stop pretending
this is a normal conversation?

249
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:02,475
[Mary] Matthew.

250
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:04,433
Sit.

251
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:13,475
[footsteps approaching]

252
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:19,100
[Peggy] Dad?

253
00:17:20,683 --> 00:17:23,308
What is this? Who are you?

254
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:26,475
[Curt] Go on. Get in there.

255
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:31,392
Mary? Mary, are you all right?

256
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:34,058
- [Peggy] What's happening?
- We're okay. It's okay, Matt.

257
00:17:34,142 --> 00:17:35,558
Why are these guys
in our house?

258
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:37,433
[Charley] Hi, Matt.
Good morning.

259
00:17:37,517 --> 00:17:41,725
There is a document in a green
safe in your boss's office.

260
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:45,225
You and me are gonna go get it.
These guys are gonna babysit.

261
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:48,350
- What are you...
- Everyone is going to be fine

262
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,683
as long as we get
what's in that safe

263
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,350
- by 10:00 a.m.
- [Mary shushing]

264
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:54,642
- Can you shut your fucking kid up?
- She's a child.

265
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:56,183
I don't care. Keep it quiet.

266
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:58,517
Come on, I'll take you
to the playroom. It's okay.

267
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,392
Okay, we're gonna go
to the playroom.

268
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:02,267
Hey. Stay in sight.

269
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,017
If you want her quiet,

270
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,683
then let her go into her goddamn
playroom, Jesus Christ. [crying]

271
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,267
- We...
- [Matt] Mary.

272
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:09,975
Sorry.

273
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:13,933
- [Ronald] Feisty.
- [Mary] Come on.

274
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:16,975
[Ronald] Hey,
put her in the room

275
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,767
and you sit right there.

276
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,725
It's okay.

277
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:25,350
I'll be right here, okay.
I'll be right here.

278
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:37,808
Hey.

279
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:43,600
Forbert won't be in the office
all week. My boss.

280
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:46,350
- Mel Forbert?
- Hey.

281
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,475
[Matt] I don't have
the combination to that safe.

282
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:52,267
[Charley] That's okay,
his secretary does.

283
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,933
And from what we understand,

284
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,308
you have the combo
to his secretary.

285
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,767
[breathing nervously]

286
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:11,767
Do you mind if we have this
conversation without my son present?

287
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,683
[Charley] Do I mind? Pleasure.

288
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,517
Matthew, go to your sister.

289
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:23,683
Matthew, go to your sister.

290
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:40,308
[whispers] Dad,
he knows Mr. Forbert.

291
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,142
He doesn't know anybody.

292
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:43,392
Get in the room.

293
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,975
Hey, do not be a hero.

294
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:50,933
Do you understand me? Do not.

295
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:52,725
All right. Go on.

296
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:58,433
Hey, listen to your father.
Get over there.

297
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:08,433
Hey.

298
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:12,808
I'm not allowed in that safe.

299
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:14,642
[Charley] I'm not interested
in any of that.

300
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,225
You'll figure it out.

301
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:19,433
[suspenseful music playing]

302
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:39,600
[sighs]

303
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:56,267
He sure wasn't smiling like
this when we said that thing

304
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,475
about the combo
to his secretary.

305
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:00,558
Drop it.

306
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,725
Actually, there is something
I'd like to know.

307
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,517
- [doorbell chimes]
- [Mary gasps]

308
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,433
Psst.

309
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:22,517
[whispers] Answer it.

310
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:30,767
Oh, darn.

311
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Door is that way.

312
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,183
Bird feeders.

313
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:36,642
- What?
- Just... This way.

314
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:42,433
[Ronald shushing]

315
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:46,100
[doorbell chimes]

316
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,058
- Is Peggy here for carpool?
- Ah, sorry, Amy.

317
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:55,600
I forgot to call your mom

318
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:57,350
and let her know that
Peggy's staying home today.

319
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,850
So, I'm so sorry. But, here,
you're gonna have to do

320
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:03,142
the hummingbird thing all by
yourself, okay? So sorry.

321
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:13,767
Just tell your mom
everything's fine. Okay?

322
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,308
- [Amy] Mmm-hmm.
- We're good.

323
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:17,725
Bye.

324
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:31,225
Well, I don't think
that's the end of that.

325
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:37,100
Yeah. No, it's not.

326
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:42,683
[Mary clears throat]

327
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,933
- Hi, Dawn.
- You okay?

328
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:47,475
Everything's fine.

329
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,308
- Mary?
- No, I'll call you later, okay?

330
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:52,017
Everything's fine.

331
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,142
Had a fight and Peg's real
upset, and we're just gonna

332
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:56,308
stay home and sort it out.
So...

333
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:59,517
Oh, I'm very sorry
about the bird feeder.

334
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,517
- You sure?
- Yeah. It's fine. I'm fine.

335
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,683
Everyone... Everyone's fine.
It's fine. Seriously.

336
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,017
Okay.

337
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,267
I'll call you later.
Okay? Bye.

338
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,517
[Dawn] Bye.

339
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,225
[Ronald] That was good work, Mary.
You're a fine actress.

340
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:26,767
[Mary] Come here.

341
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,933
[whispering]
They don't want to hurt us.

342
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:33,850
That's why
they're wearing masks.

343
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:40,183
[engine stops]

344
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:42,683
Okay. Now what?

345
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,517
You got 30 minutes.

346
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,975
Look, it's not that easy.
All right?

347
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,225
I can't just walk in there...

348
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:52,017
Twenty-nine minutes
and 54 seconds

349
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,642
my boss calls your house.

350
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,558
Fifty-one. Fifty...

351
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,767
[sighs, grunts]

352
00:23:58,517 --> 00:23:59,642
[car door slams]

353
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:01,392
Good boy.

354
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:04,100
[suspenseful music playing]

355
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,767
[indistinct chatter]

356
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,683
Good morning, Mr. Wertz.

357
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,767
The weeklies are in
and Mr. Forbert needs you to

358
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,392
compare them to the budget because
I guess they underestimated...

359
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:42,350
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right.
Okay. Good. Yeah. Okay. Good.

360
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:45,058
You can just leave those.
Uh, I'll just...

361
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:48,100
Leave them there.

362
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,142
- You told her.
- [Matt] What?

363
00:25:15,225 --> 00:25:19,808
Oh my God, you did it.
Was she okay?

364
00:25:19,892 --> 00:25:22,725
Is it strange that I'm actually
worried about Mary?

365
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:26,558
What? What? No. I didn't.
I didn't. I was gonna tell her.

366
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:31,183
I was gonna tell her and then Peggy
had a bird feeder thing and I'm... I...

367
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:34,558
It doesn't matter. And now's
there another thing and I just...

368
00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:36,475
- Okay. Right.
- I told Phil.

369
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:38,892
- [Matt] Uh-huh.
- As per our promise.

370
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:42,350
I need to get into the green
safe right now.

371
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:46,183
Why? He cried, Matt.
Phil. He cried.

372
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:49,058
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What...
The combination to the green safe is what?

373
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:51,808
I came to work
from the Humpty Dumpty Motel.

374
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:54,892
I'm sorry. I need the
combination to the green safe.

375
00:25:54,975 --> 00:26:01,100
Oh, "I"? "I," Matt? Because what about
our thing? Because I have information.

376
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:04,433
- What drawer do you keep it in?
- It is not in a drawer.

377
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:07,808
Everything will be fine.
I promise you.

378
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:09,850
Yeah, sure,
another "promise."

379
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:12,600
I am going to tell her.
I don't...

380
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:15,392
[inhales deeply, sighs]

381
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:21,642
We're fine. I'm fine.
We're f... We're fine.

382
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:24,850
Well, did you even talk to the
guy like you were supposed to?

383
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:28,225
Yes! But, no. I...

384
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:31,392
I'll call you.

385
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:37,308
But, Matt! Matt, what are you...
You can't... You can't...

386
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:39,142
[Matt grunting]

387
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:43,433
You can't do this.
Matt, you can't do this. Wait.

388
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:44,767
[door locking]

389
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,558
- [Paula banging on door]
- [breathing heavily]

390
00:27:01,308 --> 00:27:04,892
He took it, Matt.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

391
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,475
Why would Mel Forbert...

392
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:09,267
Why would Mel Forbert what?

393
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:13,850
Naismith.
He moved on it anyway.

394
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,267
"Anyway"?

395
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,725
- Oh, Paula, this is bad.
- What do you mean "anyway"?

396
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:19,600
- What?
- This is bad.

397
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:23,267
Matt? What do you mean
"Naismith"?

398
00:27:45,308 --> 00:27:47,433
Are we finished?
Can I... Can I go home now?

399
00:27:49,725 --> 00:27:52,933
Wait at the house after,
I'll call with instructions.

400
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:01,308
[Charley] Okay, wouldn't mind
stopping for some fries first.

401
00:28:01,392 --> 00:28:04,558
Well, he said that we should go
home and he'd... he'd call us.

402
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:08,642
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Uh, let's go. We'll go...

403
00:28:08,725 --> 00:28:11,808
Let's go home now.
I just want to see my family.

404
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,975
[Charley whistles]

405
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:19,433
[Matthew Jr.] So, how does
he know my dad's boss?

406
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:22,350
[Curt] He doesn't.
I already told you that.

407
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:28,642
[Matthew Jr.] Did he...
Did he work there or something? At GM?

408
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:30,767
[Curt] I don't know.
I just met him, like you.

409
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,892
[Matthew Jr.] So how do you
know he doesn't?

410
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:37,433
[Curt huffs]

411
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:44,933
Why are you doing this?

412
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,475
There's a piece of land
out there.

413
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,975
A man took it from me
and I want it back.

414
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,142
Where?

415
00:28:58,225 --> 00:29:00,683
Look, kid, we're gonna be out of
your hair in about 15 minutes.

416
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:02,475
Okay? Just relax.

417
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,558
Is my dad gonna be okay?

418
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:18,267
- Mister.
- Yeah, that's the plan. Okay?

419
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,975
Can I go see my mom, please?

420
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:35,017
Thank you.

421
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:40,267
[Curt exhales]

422
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:45,767
What happened to your plane?
It run out of gas?

423
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,392
Actually, it crashed.

424
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:51,975
[Curt sighs]

425
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,850
You want to go
see your mom, too?

426
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:55,808
No.

427
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:01,933
What did he mean "after"?

428
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:05,350
[Charley] What?

429
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:09,267
He said "Wait at the house
after." After what?

430
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,808
After we get there.

431
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:25,975
[Ronald] How do you do it?

432
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:32,600
I don't like
doing the dishes either.

433
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:35,933
I... I don't know why,
but I can't bring myself to do them.

434
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:38,225
I don't want to know
anything about you.

435
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:44,392
- We're more alike than you think.
- Please stop.

436
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:49,225
Well...

437
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:59,267
What if you don't want the things
that you're supposed to want? Hmm?

438
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:11,475
Keys in the ignition.

439
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:12,850
What? Why?

440
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:14,808
'Cause that's
what I said to do.

441
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:20,725
- Hey, your mask.
- Uh, it itches.

442
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:23,517
[tense music playing]

443
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:28,475
[Charley grunts]

444
00:31:30,183 --> 00:31:32,392
- [Mary] Matt?
- [Matt] We're good. It's done.

445
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,142
Okay, I need everyone
in the living room. Now.

446
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,642
- [Matt] Why? What is going on?
- What's going on, big guy?

447
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:38,433
[phone ringing]

448
00:31:38,517 --> 00:31:41,850
Hey, family. I need the whole
family in the living room now.

449
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,392
Where's the, uh, girl?

450
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:44,600
The little one? The little girl?
Where's your...

451
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,183
- Peg.
- She's in here.

452
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:47,683
Well, get her then.
Will you give me a hand here?

453
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,517
[Matt] Hold on a minute,
mister. Hold on, okay?

454
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,933
You're scaring them and they
have been scared enough.

455
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:52,683
Yeah, what are we doing here,
Charley?

456
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,767
We're following instructions.
Living room.

457
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,683
Are you helping me
or are you not helping me?

458
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:59,350
No, no, no, no. The man in the
alley said that you would wait here

459
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,558
and he would call you
with instructions.

460
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:03,058
[Charley] Those are
other instructions,

461
00:32:03,142 --> 00:32:05,100
which are none
of your business.

462
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:07,558
The instructions at present are to
get your family in the living room

463
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:09,267
close together.
Do you understand me?

464
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,183
- Sir, I must respectfully ask that...
- Ah, fuck.

465
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:13,308
- [gunshot]
- [grunts]

466
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,767
What the fuck was that about?

467
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,767
Put it down. Ronald.
Ronald, just think.

468
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,267
- I am not putting it down.
- All right. It was a setup, man.

469
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,933
Think. Think.
It's a setup, man.

470
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:29,517
[phone continues ringing]

471
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,267
[Curt] Where's his mask, man?
Huh?

472
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,142
- [Ronald] This is wrong.
- Think, Ronald.

473
00:32:34,225 --> 00:32:36,142
Someone answer
the fucking phone!

474
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:39,725
- [Curt] Calm down, man.
- [Mary whimpering]

475
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:41,392
[Curt] Relax.

476
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:43,183
[Ronald] Answer the phone.

477
00:32:46,142 --> 00:32:47,475
[nervously] Hello?

478
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:48,850
[Jones on phone] <i>Who is this?</i>

479
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,183
Mary Wertz. Who is this?

480
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:54,517
<i>Put the one on
who just came back.</i>

481
00:32:55,975 --> 00:33:00,392
Um, he's just...

482
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:04,267
He's not with us. [sniffles]

483
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,017
<i>Put your husband on.</i>

484
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:09,850
He wants to talk to you.

485
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:11,058
Yes?

486
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:12,683
<i>What were you thinking,
Matthew?</i>

487
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,308
<i>I'm actually asking.</i>

488
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:19,767
- What do you mean?
- What's going on?

489
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,433
<i>Do you think
we're fucking idiots?</i>

490
00:33:21,517 --> 00:33:22,475
- [Mary] Matthew, what is going on?
- [Matthew Jr.] Mom?

491
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:23,683
[Mary] Matthew, shh!

492
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,808
- Mom? Dad?
- Matt, what is going on?

493
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:29,183
Matthew, please.
Your mother said "be quiet."

494
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:33,558
[Jones] <i>Put Charley on.
Don't tell me he stepped out.</i>

495
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,100
- Who's this?
- <i>I said put Charley on the phone.</i>

496
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:46,267
[Ronald] Uh, he didn't show.

497
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:50,600
Are we getting fucked here,
Jones?

498
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:52,600
<i>Put the other one on.</i>

499
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:55,267
<i>Put the other one on, now,
or I will go so far up the chain,</i>

500
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,517
<i>you will find yourself in all 48
states at the same fucking time!</i>

501
00:34:01,267 --> 00:34:04,017
- What is it?
- <i>I said Charley.</i>

502
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:06,808
He's indisposed, man.

503
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:10,017
<i>All right. Listen to me carefully.
Fuck Charley.</i>

504
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,558
<i>Kill Ronald and the others</i>

505
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:13,350
<i>and meet me at the
Flame Show Bar in half an hour.</i>

506
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,350
<i>You'll get your share
and theirs.</i>

507
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:16,350
Got it.

508
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:17,725
[line disconnects]

509
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,767
[Curt sighs]

510
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:27,142
What'd you do?

511
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,683
The safe was empty.

512
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,475
Forbert must have taken
the document home.

513
00:34:32,558 --> 00:34:33,892
I had to put something
in the envelope.

514
00:34:33,975 --> 00:34:35,850
You put us at risk?

515
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:37,933
- What was I supposed to do?
- What is wrong with you?

516
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:39,683
Hey, hey, hey.
Shut up. Shut up!

517
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:42,767
Keys. Give me your car keys.

518
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,767
[hesitates] He said
leave them in the car.

519
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:49,600
- [Mary gasps] No.
- [Ronald] Hey, hey, hey.

520
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:51,392
Whoa, Ronald.

521
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:56,558
Listen, you shot him.

522
00:34:56,642 --> 00:35:00,308
Okay, he broke in, you disarmed
him, and you shot him.

523
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:02,683
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Here. Take it.

524
00:35:06,392 --> 00:35:08,267
[Mary gasps and cries]

525
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,850
Okay, let's go.

526
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,017
Look, I'm gonna need you.

527
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,808
And when I do,
I expect you to help me.

528
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:21,225
Understand? Hey!
You understand?

529
00:35:21,308 --> 00:35:23,392
- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

530
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,892
We need to find
someplace to stay tonight.

531
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:41,433
[Curt] <i>Charley knew the bagman.</i>

532
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:44,975
He knew Jones.
You couldn't tell that?

533
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,767
[Ronald] I got cash up front.

534
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,142
Yeah, which they were gonna pick
right back up off your corpse.

535
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:53,975
He told me to kill everybody in the house.
You, too, Ronald.

536
00:35:54,058 --> 00:36:01,100
Who told you to kill me? Jones?
On the phone? Or before?

537
00:36:01,183 --> 00:36:04,433
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

538
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,767
They see me?
They're Frank's guys.

539
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:18,183
I know why Frank wants me dead.
Why's he want you dead?

540
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:19,600
[Ronald] No fucking idea.

541
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,225
Fuck Capelli.

542
00:36:22,308 --> 00:36:24,767
[Curt] This thing
is bigger than Frank.

543
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,558
I mean, think about it.

544
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:30,350
They gonna give us $5,000 for
just three hours of babysitting?

545
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:33,142
And the thing they want
is in a fucking safe at GM.

546
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,850
Maybe this outfit
out of Chicago is real?

547
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:39,642
[Curt] Yeah.

548
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:43,642
Try to kill me. Think you're the
only one that can make a move?

549
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:47,892
Yeah, I can make a move, too. They can
consider this shit a market adjustment.

550
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:57,100
- Excuse me, sir.
- You're excused.

551
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:18,683
- Wait. Wait. Jesus, Curt.
- [Curt shushing]

552
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:21,433
Aldrick Watkins
or Frank Capelli?

553
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:23,642
You can tell me the truth now.

554
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,225
I don't know.

555
00:37:25,308 --> 00:37:27,433
Uh-huh. Get up.

556
00:37:28,183 --> 00:37:29,433
[Jimmy grunts]

557
00:37:30,725 --> 00:37:34,017
Goddamn, man.
I just got back to sleep.

558
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,808
[Curt] Get your big ass up.

559
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:44,183
Who set me up, Jimmy?

560
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,725
Go open that door right there.

561
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:55,642
Turn around.

562
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:03,933
Now back up. Back. Back.

563
00:38:04,017 --> 00:38:08,850
Back. Back, back, back, back.

564
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:11,058
I got two kids now, Curtis,

565
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:14,975
they threatened to...
to kill 'em both if I ain't fish you out.

566
00:38:15,058 --> 00:38:17,683
- Fish me, specifically, out? Who?
- I don't know.

567
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:21,058
Jimmy, I will put a bullet in your
gut, flip you over this rail,

568
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:22,683
and let you
bleed out down there.

569
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:27,892
All I know is that a guy
called me a half an hour ago.

570
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:32,058
Offering me $10,000
to turn you in.

571
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:34,975
$15,000 for the white guy.

572
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:36,308
Was it Jones?

573
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:38,267
He wasn't white.

574
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:44,433
He just said that Mr. Watkins would
appreciate it, on behalf of Mr. Capelli.

575
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:46,100
Wait a minute. Wait.

576
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:49,183
You're telling me that Capelli
hired Watkins to fish me out?

577
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:52,683
I don't know. "Hired"? I don't know.
They got some type of arrangement.

578
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,475
- Oh, they're working together now?
- I don't know.

579
00:38:54,558 --> 00:38:56,225
- That's bullshit, Jimmy!
- I don't know!

580
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:59,725
You can throw me over this rail
and I still won't know.

581
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:02,767
[officer] Sounds like the man of the
house, Matthew Wertz,

582
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,308
says he surprised the intruder,
disarmed him, and shot.

583
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:08,475
[detective] Okay. All right, thanks
for your time. We appreciate it. Okay.

584
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,808

[detectives chattering]

587
00:39:39,808 --> 00:39:42,392
Mr. Wertz?
I'm Detective Joe Finney,

588
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:44,058
Michigan State
Attorney General's office,

589
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:45,725
Organized Crime Task Force.

590
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:47,850
Organized Crime?

591
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:52,850
Yeah. Uh, Detroit Police, uh,
got two phone calls.

592
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,517
One from a friend,
Mrs. Atkinson,

593
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,183
she said she was concerned.

594
00:39:57,267 --> 00:39:58,725
And then another from a neighbor,
said they heard loud noises.

595
00:39:58,808 --> 00:40:01,433
Organized Crime?
Like the mob?

596
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:05,850
Well, I guess that's the
$64,000 question, isn't it?

597
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:08,683
Yeah, her badgering was annoying
him, so he took her in to get her

598
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:12,017
out of the way. He was only in
there a minute. Came back out.

599
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,850
I had followed,
and so I was turning.

600
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:21,392
Um, and then I kind of came up behind
him, sort of. Like here.

601
00:40:21,475 --> 00:40:23,183
All three shots then
from this angle?

602
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:28,392
No, I moved to here and I
saw him reaching for his gun,

603
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:30,850
and then I shot again twice
as he was falling.

604
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:34,683
But you told me
you had his gun.

605
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,350
How many were there?

606
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:37,725
[Matthew Jr.] One of them.

607
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:39,267
"Of them"?

608
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:44,517
One person.
One person. Him.

609
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,475
First, I didn't see anything.
I just heard a gunshot.

610
00:40:48,558 --> 00:40:50,350
I was in the playroom
for most of the time.

611
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:52,392
[Finney] Yeah,
"most of the time".

612
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:55,392
When did you go
into the playroom?

613
00:40:55,475 --> 00:40:58,475
When my dad told me
to go in the playroom?

614
00:40:58,558 --> 00:41:00,600
Why did he tell you
to go in the playroom?

615
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:03,433
I don't remember.

616
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:06,517
I closed my eyes, honestly,
for the whole thing.

617
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,392
I just couldn't believe
what was happening.

618
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:12,808
- [Finney] It's very scary.
- Yeah. So, I... I didn't see what...

619
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:14,767
I mean, is there anything
you can think of?

620
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:18,642
Any reason for this man to have
targeted you and your family?

621
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:20,683
[exhales deeply]

622
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:23,142
He doesn't like happiness?

623
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:36,558
Can I have the keys?

624
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:43,808
I'd like to listen
to the radio.

625
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,308
Oh, my.

626
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:51,392
Rudy.

627
00:41:52,642 --> 00:41:57,183
Uh, I only need a minute.
If you don't mind.

628
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,308
[sighs]

629
00:42:01,308 --> 00:42:02,558
Thank you.

630
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:06,558
Clarisse home?

631
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:11,600
Angel? You have a visitor.

632
00:42:11,683 --> 00:42:13,475
[Clarisse] Okay. Just a minute.

633
00:42:16,475 --> 00:42:17,683
Been all right?

634
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:26,100
So, uh, I hear they're flattening
the neighborhood all the way down

635
00:42:26,183 --> 00:42:29,558
to the cemetery. Pulling up
those trolley tracks too, huh?

636
00:42:29,642 --> 00:42:33,017
- Hmm.
- Yeah, "urban renewal."

637
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,058
More like "Negro removal."

638
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:37,433
[chuckles]
Yeah, that's right.

639
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:43,142
Hey, Clarisse.

640
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:45,808
When'd you get out?

641
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:48,850
Uh, day before yesterday.

642
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,183
They said
it was overcrowded, so...

643
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:55,558
- [Clarisse chuckles] Well, Detroit.
- Detroit.

644
00:42:56,475 --> 00:42:58,433
How can we help you, Curtis?

645
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:01,850
Uh, I believe she still
has my suitcase.

646
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:17,058
Heard you knifed someone
day one.

647
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:20,433
It wasn't like that.

648
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:22,600
All them fellas was mad at me
when I went in there.

649
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,808
Guy came at me with a knife. I had to
defend myself. Only way to survive.

650
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:30,433
Well, guess it worked.

651
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,683
Time being.

652
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:40,225
So, what'd you do in there,
all that time?

653
00:43:42,475 --> 00:43:47,142
Thinking. You know.
Just... Just a lot of thinking.

654
00:43:51,392 --> 00:43:52,600
How long are you gonna...

655
00:43:52,683 --> 00:43:55,933
Oh, not long.
Today, tomorrow, maybe.

656
00:43:57,392 --> 00:43:59,933
- Where are you gonna go?
- Kansas City.

657
00:44:00,017 --> 00:44:02,392
- Really?
- Yeah.

658
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:04,100
Oh.

659
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,308
Man wants forty-seven-fifty
for it now.

660
00:44:06,392 --> 00:44:08,558
[chuckles] He build on it
or something?

661
00:44:08,642 --> 00:44:13,183
You'd think, right?
Nah, he just knows I want it.

662
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:21,100
You know Aldrick Watkins is never
gonna let you outta here alive.

663
00:44:21,183 --> 00:44:24,058
I know. I know.
I'm working on that. Trust me.

664
00:44:26,183 --> 00:44:27,808
[baby crying]

665
00:44:32,308 --> 00:44:34,017
[Clarisse sighs]

666
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,808
[baby wailing]

667
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:38,892
Thank you.

668
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,350
Okay.

669
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,892
Good luck, Curt.

670
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:56,933
Curt. You're not
to come back here.

671
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,683
I wouldn't think of it.

672
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:24,558
[Ronald] Is that
what I think it is?

673
00:45:24,642 --> 00:45:26,392
It depends on
what you think it is.

674
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:28,517
You'll, uh, let me know
if you need anything else?

675
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,933
Oh, yeah. Don't you worry. I'll...
I'll definitely be in touch.

676
00:45:33,017 --> 00:45:33,933
Good.

677
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:42,683
[phone ringing]

678
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:47,683
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it!

679
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:50,392
- Yes?
- [Curt] <i>Can you talk?</i>

680
00:45:50,475 --> 00:45:53,517
- Yes.
- <i>This is that call I promised.</i>

681
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,808
<i>It stays between you and me.
Do I have your word?</i>

682
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:59,892
- Yes.
- <i>Get the keys to your wife's car.</i>

683
00:45:59,975 --> 00:46:04,600
<i>Meet us at the auto shop on
Lafayette and Russell in 20 minutes.</i>

684
00:46:04,683 --> 00:46:08,058
<i>Alone, Matt. Now hang up.</i>

685
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:09,558
- [Mary] What did he say?
- [Matthew Jr.] What did they say?

686
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,142
- [Peggy] What is happening?
- Pack a bag.

687
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:13,225
- [Matthew Jr.] Pack a bag? Why?
- Pack a bag.

688
00:46:13,308 --> 00:46:15,058
Why do we need to pack a bag?
I don't want to go. Where are we going?

689
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:16,892
Matthew! Matthew! I'm done
with your lip! All right?

690
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:19,350
- [Mary] Okay. Okay.
- Pack a bag! Jesus Christ!

691
00:46:23,808 --> 00:46:27,558
[Matt] Okay. Thank you, Dawn.
Appreciate it.

692
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:32,350
[suspenseful music playing]

693
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:47,933
[Ronald] Here he comes.

694
00:46:48,017 --> 00:46:49,475
[Curt] Hurry up. Come on.

695
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:54,683
Get in the car. Hurry up.

696
00:46:56,808 --> 00:46:58,767
Where your boss live?

697
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,767
Northern Ohio.
About an hour away.

698
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,142
Well, that's where
we're headed then.

699
00:47:02,225 --> 00:47:03,808
Wait, wait, wait.
I can't promise anything.

700
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:05,642
I'm not even sure
that he's home.

701
00:47:05,725 --> 00:47:07,767
[Ronald] Only outcome is that
we get that document. Okay?

702
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:09,142
[car engine starts]

703
00:47:14,183 --> 00:47:15,433
[tires screeching]

704
00:47:36,558 --> 00:47:37,767
What are you doing?

705
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,058
Making sure you don't do
something stupid.

706
00:47:41,183 --> 00:47:42,225
[Matt sighs]

707
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,808
- Wait, I...
- I'm Matt Wertz.

708
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:49,892
- Accounting. Well, payables.
- Ah, yes.

709
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:54,017
Is there something I can do
for you, Mr. Wertz?

710
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,600
I need to speak to Mr. Forbert,
please. These are, um...

711
00:47:56,683 --> 00:47:58,725
We work together.
It's, uh, it's urgent.

712
00:47:58,808 --> 00:48:01,350
[Ronald shushing]
Where is your husband?

713
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:03,017
[hesitates]
He's in his office.

714
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,808
- Where is his office?
- It's upstairs. I know where.

715
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:08,350
- [Curt] All right. You got it?
- [Ronald] Yeah.

716
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:11,933
Let's go inside. Let's go inside.
Let's go inside.

717
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:15,683
[Ronald exhales]

718
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,100
[Mel] Come in.

719
00:48:40,725 --> 00:48:42,350
[chuckles] Wertz?

720
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:54,225
Hi, Mel. Hi.
Louise told me to come up.

721
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,100
I've never done this.

722
00:48:57,183 --> 00:49:01,308
I've never, uh, I've never come to
you in this way, but I... I need...

723
00:49:01,392 --> 00:49:04,517
- I absolutely need...
- What?

724
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,392
...to borrow whatever that
document was that was in your safe.

725
00:49:09,475 --> 00:49:11,225
Oh, well,
that's not possible.

726
00:49:11,308 --> 00:49:13,058
And why would you need that?

727
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:17,642
Because the person that put it
together made some mistakes.

728
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:20,017
And, uh, they...
I told him that I would

729
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,350
sneak it back to him so that he could
come give you the revised version.

730
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:27,100
Well... [smacks lips] Uh,
I put it together. Myself.

731
00:49:27,183 --> 00:49:30,308
Not one other person at the
company even knows about it.

732
00:49:30,392 --> 00:49:32,225
Okay, that was a lie.

733
00:49:34,142 --> 00:49:35,725
That's how important it is,

734
00:49:36,517 --> 00:49:37,808
that I would lie to you.

735
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,267
And that I would do
what I did at work,

736
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,808
which I never would do
if it weren't that important.

737
00:49:43,892 --> 00:49:46,475
Okay, well,
you need to leave, Matt.

738
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:49,433
I can't.

739
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:51,392
I'm gonna slowly
reach for the phone.

740
00:49:51,475 --> 00:49:53,100
No, no, no.

741
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:54,933
You need to go.

742
00:49:57,308 --> 00:49:59,600
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- I can't.

743
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:04,017
[hesitates] Now,
what are you doing?

744
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,975
This is me warning you that I'm
going to have to get physical.

745
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:10,392
It is literally life or death
for me, sir.

746
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:13,558
Look, do you know what will happen
to you if you keep going with this?

747
00:50:13,642 --> 00:50:15,808
I do. I'm sorry.

748
00:50:15,892 --> 00:50:17,517
[Matt grunts loudly]

749
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:22,850
I'm gonna punch you now, sir.

750
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:24,225
What the fuck, Wertz?

751
00:50:24,308 --> 00:50:26,892
I'm punching you.
This is going to be a punch.

752
00:50:26,975 --> 00:50:30,308
I can't give it to you.
This is proprietary information.

753
00:50:30,392 --> 00:50:31,975
I'm sorry.

754
00:50:32,058 --> 00:50:34,142
[Mel groans in pain]

755
00:50:34,225 --> 00:50:36,308
I love my job, sir!

756
00:50:36,392 --> 00:50:38,850
I love my job and this is
how important this is

757
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:41,183
that I'm willing to be fired.

758
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:43,558
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

759
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:49,100
Don't worry.
Nothing's gonna happen.

760
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,808
We're gonna be
out of here in no time.

761
00:50:53,933 --> 00:50:55,892
[TV playing indistinctly]

762
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:00,475
[exhales] Ma'am...

763
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,808
[Louise whimpering]

764
00:51:03,892 --> 00:51:05,600
It's been a long day.

765
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:12,100
And I'm gonna have to put
this over you so I can relax.

766
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:15,017
You understand? Thank you.

767
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,142
[Louise crying]

768
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:21,725
[Ronald sighs]

769
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,850
[grunts, panting]

770
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:01,433
[Curt] Hey.

771
00:52:02,475 --> 00:52:04,308
We got it. We can go.

772
00:52:04,392 --> 00:52:07,392
Bye, Louise. Thank you. Sorry.

773
00:52:09,975 --> 00:52:11,017
[door opens]

774
00:52:11,892 --> 00:52:13,142
You have a good time?

775
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,392
[door closes]

776
00:52:31,308 --> 00:52:33,642
Mel! Mel?

777
00:52:35,683 --> 00:52:36,642
[groans]

778
00:52:36,725 --> 00:52:40,558
What happened?
Oh, my God, Mel.

779
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:42,933
I'm calling the police!

780
00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:44,308
- No.
- I'm calling the...

781
00:52:44,392 --> 00:52:48,975
No police! Please, hon, please.
No police.

782
00:52:49,058 --> 00:52:53,183
[Brian] Wow. Though once we
had in that bar, Coogan's!

783
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:56,767
Dawn, you remember that? When the
guy, the colored guy approached you

784
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,308
and I got in the middle,
but I'm a big guy.

785
00:53:00,725 --> 00:53:02,892
He was
one of the small ones.

786
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:05,392
But a guy with a gun?
That is...

787
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:07,267
That is not what
I imagined old Matt would do.

788
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,683
- [Dawn] Brian.
- What? It's not.

789
00:53:11,725 --> 00:53:16,225
I'm sorry, Mary, your husband surprised
me, that's all. In a good way.

790
00:53:16,308 --> 00:53:21,850
Often wondered, myself,
what I'd do, situation like that.

791
00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:23,767
Don't want to put that
to the test, though.

792
00:53:25,725 --> 00:53:28,308
- I'll be back for dinner.
- Oh, you are not leaving, Matt.

793
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:33,350
Matt is Dad.
My name is Matthew.

794
00:53:37,267 --> 00:53:38,392
[door opens]

795
00:53:39,892 --> 00:53:41,017
[door closes]

796
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,558
[Finney] Matthew?

797
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:03,017
Come here for a second.

798
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,017
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna bite.

799
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:09,600
You're not in trouble.
Nor is your dad.

800
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:14,725
It's the men that put you
into this position

801
00:54:14,808 --> 00:54:16,767
that we're concerned about.
You understand?

802
00:54:20,142 --> 00:54:22,225
One day, you want,
you can come to my office,

803
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:25,642
I'll show you diagrams
going back 20 years.

804
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:29,808
All the way back to Italy,
believe it or not. Even Africa.

805
00:54:32,183 --> 00:54:33,892
For right now,

806
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:36,142
you can help us fill this
picture in a little bit,

807
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:40,558
just by answering a couple
few easy questions. Hmm?

808
00:54:40,642 --> 00:54:42,725
I already answered questions.

809
00:54:42,808 --> 00:54:48,267
Well, you did, but there's just this one
thing that keeps sticking in my head.

810
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:55,058
You said that, uh,
that "one of them" held you at gunpoint.

811
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:57,808
One of them. One of them.
One of who?

812
00:54:57,892 --> 00:54:59,600
No, I...
No, I said "him." He...

813
00:54:59,683 --> 00:55:04,975
Well, no, no, you changed it to
"him." You changed it. You know?

814
00:55:05,058 --> 00:55:09,725
But me, I'm more of a "go with your
first instinct" kind of guy. Right?

815
00:55:09,808 --> 00:55:13,142
So what I'm asking you,
Matthew...

816
00:55:13,225 --> 00:55:16,808
I'm asking if you can
remember any names...

817
00:55:18,017 --> 00:55:21,267
or any identifying
characteristics, at all?

818
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:25,017
You know, Doug Jones?

819
00:55:26,683 --> 00:55:30,392
Frank Capelli?
Aldrick Watkins? Anything?

820
00:55:35,683 --> 00:55:37,100
Is my dad in trouble?

821
00:55:39,433 --> 00:55:40,475
Well...

822
00:55:42,558 --> 00:55:44,392
Honestly, Matthew, the...

823
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:47,642
the only time
in my experience people

824
00:55:47,725 --> 00:55:50,142
get into trouble is when
they don't tell the truth.

825
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:58,933
There were three of them.

826
00:55:59,017 --> 00:56:00,308
There were three of them.

827
00:56:02,142 --> 00:56:06,142
I'm sorry, Dawn. He's gonna do what
he's gonna do. I can't stop him.

828
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:09,808
It's okay. It's okay.

829
00:56:12,142 --> 00:56:13,558
Poor thing.

830
00:56:15,892 --> 00:56:20,350
It's okay.
This is a really hard time.

831
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:25,808
No, it's something else, and I can't...
I can't talk about it.

832
00:56:25,892 --> 00:56:29,058
You can talk to me about
anything. You know that.

833
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:37,433
How do you do it?
Actually, how does anyone do it?

834
00:56:37,517 --> 00:56:39,850
- What do you mean?
- Just anything.

835
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:45,058
All of it.
This, and this, and...

836
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:48,350
It's impossible.

837
00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:56,933
I was thinking that maybe
we could go away somewhere?

838
00:56:59,142 --> 00:57:00,142
Who?

839
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:05,308
Us. A trip.

840
00:57:05,392 --> 00:57:07,475
Together, somewhere.

841
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:15,975
Good luck
explaining that one.

842
00:57:20,308 --> 00:57:22,100
So, is that
the real one, Matt?

843
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:27,100
I just want this to be over.

844
00:57:29,142 --> 00:57:30,517
[Curt] What is it?

845
00:57:32,183 --> 00:57:37,350
Some new exhaust system.
Like a muffler.

846
00:57:37,433 --> 00:57:39,350
Is that what it is, Matt?
It's a muffler?

847
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:44,100
I don't know.
They don't tell me anything.

848
00:57:44,183 --> 00:57:47,017
I just push numbers around.

849
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,933
You're pushing more
than numbers now, big guy.

850
00:57:49,017 --> 00:57:51,475
[Curt chuckles]
You got that right.

851
00:57:58,683 --> 00:57:59,850
All right.

852
00:58:01,642 --> 00:58:04,058
May I have
my car back, please?

853
00:58:05,392 --> 00:58:07,017
We like your car, Matt.

854
00:58:20,392 --> 00:58:22,642
[Matt] <i>Dawn,
please just put her on.</i>

855
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:23,933
[Dawn over phone]
<i>Not tonight.</i>

856
00:58:24,017 --> 00:58:26,517
Everything is so weird
right now.

857
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,725
Oh, Paula Cole, Matt?

858
00:58:31,433 --> 00:58:34,225
Sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

859
00:58:34,308 --> 00:58:38,142
Dawn, please.
Just put her on.

860
00:58:38,225 --> 00:58:41,517
Matt, not tonight. I'm sorry.

861
00:58:44,475 --> 00:58:46,642
- [man on TV] <i>Gee, what a beautiful room.</i>
- [Mary sighs]

862
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:48,850
[railway crossing
bells ringing]

863
00:58:57,225 --> 00:58:59,642
Do you have it?
Matt...

864
00:58:59,725 --> 00:59:02,433
Wait. Wait.

865
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:07,017
- Matt...
- Wait. Just wait. Just wait.

866
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,100
- You went to Forbert's?
- Yes.

867
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,225
- And so you got it?
- Yes.

868
00:59:11,308 --> 00:59:13,642
- Okay, so you...
- Wait. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait.

869
00:59:13,725 --> 00:59:16,017
- Wait, wait, wait.
- So you have the document.

870
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:20,933
Wait, wait, wait.
There's a conversation that I... that I...

871
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:24,683
intended to have with you.

872
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:28,142
[sighs] That I've been...

873
00:59:28,225 --> 00:59:31,225
That I set aside time to
have, with you, two days ago.

874
00:59:32,142 --> 00:59:34,517
[Paula] Okay.

875
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,725
But if you remember
Peggy had that bird feeder...

876
00:59:39,892 --> 00:59:40,850
Anyway...

877
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,308
the conversation that I intended
to have with you two days ago,

878
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:49,142
I'd like to have with you now so that
you understand the chain of events

879
00:59:49,225 --> 00:59:52,100
that led to this moment,
where we are right here now.

880
00:59:52,183 --> 00:59:54,975
So this conversation
that I'd like to have now,

881
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,850
which I recognize
at this point is conceptual...

882
00:59:57,933 --> 01:00:00,392
- Everything's...
- Matt, where is the document?

883
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:01,683
Where is it?

884
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:06,600
Did you even reach out to
Naismith in the first place?

885
01:00:06,683 --> 01:00:10,058
- Yes. Yes, I spoke to him a week ago.
- Okay, and what did you say?

886
01:00:10,142 --> 01:00:11,892
I... Let me finish.

887
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,142
I told him what you told me.
I said that a very important person

888
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:17,808
at my company has a document
that involves the Big Four

889
01:00:17,892 --> 01:00:21,100
that I think your bosses at
Studebaker would be very interested...

890
01:00:21,183 --> 01:00:23,683
- You said that? You...
- Yes. Let me finish. Let me finish.

891
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:25,892
And he agreed.
He agreed to buy it.

892
01:00:27,017 --> 01:00:30,433
Okay. And?

893
01:00:30,517 --> 01:00:35,058
Imagine this is two days ago
that I'm telling you this, okay?

894
01:00:35,142 --> 01:00:36,600
You never called him back.

895
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,683
No. I did. I did.

896
01:00:38,767 --> 01:00:39,850
[sighs] Oh.

897
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,392
But what I wanted
to tell you is that...

898
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:47,392
Mmm-hmm.
You chickened out. Mmm.

899
01:00:47,475 --> 01:00:48,808
No, I decided it was wrong.

900
01:00:48,892 --> 01:00:51,600
And so you chickened out.
Oh, God.

901
01:00:51,683 --> 01:00:55,100
No, it was a process.
A proc... A thought...

902
01:00:55,183 --> 01:00:57,600
- I did not just "chicken out."
- No, no, no, no, no.

903
01:00:57,683 --> 01:00:59,808
I contacted a realtor.

904
01:00:59,892 --> 01:01:01,975
I rented us a car
for when we got to California.

905
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,767
I didn't know
that you'd move so fast.

906
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:07,058
- Oh, God.
- I didn't know Naismith would...

907
01:01:07,142 --> 01:01:10,433
Oh, my God,
you said "anyway".

908
01:01:10,517 --> 01:01:13,142
Back in the office,
you said,

909
01:01:13,225 --> 01:01:15,975
"He moved on it anyway" and I was
thinking, "Anyway what?"

910
01:01:16,058 --> 01:01:17,808
But now I know exactly
what "anyway what?" means,

911
01:01:17,892 --> 01:01:20,350
it means you chickened out
and Naismith

912
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:22,975
knew about it
and he moved on it anyway,

913
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:27,808
and now I am stuck in the
Humpty fucking Dumpty Motel

914
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:30,100
with a guy who could
see the brass ring

915
01:01:30,183 --> 01:01:34,017
coming around the corner and
then literally watched it pass,

916
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,767
while he was making a plan
to grab that brass ring.

917
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,767
I was not making a plan.
I was executing a plan.

918
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,100
To not do the thing.

919
01:01:41,183 --> 01:01:43,975
That I acknowledge
that we said we would do.

920
01:01:44,058 --> 01:01:46,350
- "Executing" how?
- Calling Naismith.

921
01:01:46,433 --> 01:01:48,392
And telling him we were out.

922
01:01:48,475 --> 01:01:51,725
Which is what I was gonna
tell you two days ago.

923
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:53,642
No, no, no, no, no.

924
01:01:53,725 --> 01:01:55,850
- And now...
- Here we are.

925
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:58,100
Yeah. Here we are.

926
01:01:59,017 --> 01:02:00,892
[Paula sighs]

927
01:02:00,975 --> 01:02:03,308
I guess I'll call
the rental company.

928
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:06,933
And, I guess I'll call Phil.

929
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:26,392
It's all the way back.

930
01:02:38,475 --> 01:02:42,433
Hey, uh, can Jones
activate on his own?

931
01:02:44,975 --> 01:02:46,517
No idea what you mean.

932
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,683
Can he call shots
is what I'm asking?

933
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:55,183
Are you planning
to bring Frank in?

934
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:58,100
I am considering it.

935
01:03:00,142 --> 01:03:01,892
How are you
gonna approach him?

936
01:03:03,808 --> 01:03:09,350
Well, from what I could
discern, you know his wife.

937
01:03:17,267 --> 01:03:19,892
So you want me to go
and knock on his door?

938
01:03:19,975 --> 01:03:22,142
He's not gonna
mess with you, Ronald.

939
01:03:22,225 --> 01:03:23,725
We got what he wants.

940
01:03:24,558 --> 01:03:26,017
All you need to do

941
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,808
is convince him to show up
at Cafe Roma with $50,000.

942
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,433
- Fifty? Mmm.
- That's right.

943
01:03:30,517 --> 01:03:35,392
And we'll give him
the document. 25. 25.

944
01:03:35,475 --> 01:03:38,850
Now if he balks,
we'll know we hit near the ceiling.

945
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,142
But if he bites,

946
01:03:41,225 --> 01:03:44,475
then we know there's a lot
more where that came from.

947
01:03:44,558 --> 01:03:47,600
You know, he's not gonna move a
hair unless he sees that thing.

948
01:03:51,767 --> 01:03:53,683
Yeah, you probably right
about that.

949
01:03:53,767 --> 01:03:54,892
[Ronald] Mmm-hmm.

950
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:14,142
Take it.

951
01:04:17,475 --> 01:04:19,017
Wow.

952
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,767
- Take these, too.
- [keys clatter]

953
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:41,558
[Lonnie] <i>Curt, man,
you've got to go.</i>

954
01:04:41,642 --> 01:04:43,267
<i>I just can't have
the scrutiny here.</i>

955
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:45,183
[Curt] <i>What scrutiny?</i>

956
01:04:45,267 --> 01:04:47,975
Man, we're talking about 12 hours tops.
I'm gonna be gone in the morning.

957
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:50,767
- And they just raised the bounty.
- What?

958
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,058
I'm talking 20 for you now.
25 for the white guy.

959
01:04:54,142 --> 01:04:58,017
Wait, you telling me that
the bounty is 45 for just us?

960
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,433
- That's what they told me.
- "They"?

961
01:05:00,517 --> 01:05:03,308
Both gangs.
Capelli and Watkins.

962
01:05:04,558 --> 01:05:06,517
Shit, I thought Jimmy
was just lying.

963
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,183
No, man, that's what
I'm telling you, Curt,

964
01:05:08,267 --> 01:05:10,100
things are different
everywhere now, man.

965
01:05:10,183 --> 01:05:13,100
Okay, this bounty. Is it...
Is it dead or alive?

966
01:05:13,183 --> 01:05:15,683
The white dude, either.
But for you?

967
01:05:15,767 --> 01:05:18,933
Capelli wants you dead
and Watkins wants you alive.

968
01:05:20,892 --> 01:05:22,225
That's not good.

969
01:05:22,308 --> 01:05:24,392
And that's why I can't
have you here, man.

970
01:05:24,475 --> 01:05:26,725
I been on the up and up
since you went in.

971
01:05:26,808 --> 01:05:29,392
I haven't touched them
numbers in four years.

972
01:05:29,475 --> 01:05:30,725
I got a job now.

973
01:05:30,808 --> 01:05:31,933
I'm a bellman at the Gotham.

974
01:05:32,017 --> 01:05:33,267
I got a good girl.

975
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,017
And I don't wanna
have to lie to people,

976
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,808
but I also don't want people
in my shit here.

977
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,475
All right. All right.
How much you make at the Gotham?

978
01:05:40,558 --> 01:05:42,892
It's good. $11 a day.

979
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:48,933
Okay. Here's 200.
That is five times that for you tonight.

980
01:05:49,017 --> 01:05:51,475
Okay, and get me
a couple more guys.

981
01:05:51,558 --> 01:05:53,183
Uh, I'll give them
200 each, too.

982
01:05:53,267 --> 01:05:55,725
See if you can find
some of them Purple Gang boys

983
01:05:55,808 --> 01:05:58,142
unless the Italians done run
them out of town already.

984
01:05:58,225 --> 01:06:01,225
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I'm gonna get what's mine.

985
01:06:01,308 --> 01:06:02,850
[sighs] And since when you...

986
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:05,225
I don't need a fucking
lecture from you, Lonnie.

987
01:06:05,308 --> 01:06:08,183
You ain't got no goddamn idea
what's going on.

988
01:06:08,267 --> 01:06:11,183
Now, you gonna
do this shit or not?

989
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:15,392
All right. So you just make
sure you tell them to watch me

990
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:18,433
and I'm gonna make a move or knock
over my glass and hit the deck.

991
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:21,100
And when I hit the deck,
they go to work.

992
01:06:21,183 --> 01:06:25,267
I just got to ask you this, man.
Why the extra muscle?

993
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:28,100
In case the fellow I'm working
with is trying to sell me out.

994
01:06:28,183 --> 01:06:29,558
And how you gonna know this?

995
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:32,308
It's Ronald Russo.

996
01:06:33,683 --> 01:06:35,267
[Vanessa] Frank, if you're not
gonna peel 'em,

997
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,725
can you at least come
get the eyes out, please?

998
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:39,683
You know how I feel
about the eyes.

999
01:06:42,183 --> 01:06:44,725
- Frank!
- [Frank] Mmm-hmm.

1000
01:06:44,808 --> 01:06:45,933
[doorbell ringing]

1001
01:06:46,017 --> 01:06:48,225
- Are you gonna get that?
- Yes!

1002
01:07:07,642 --> 01:07:09,183
What do you want?

1003
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:12,100
- Hi, Frank.
- What do you want?

1004
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:13,933
We had a little slip up
at work.

1005
01:07:15,058 --> 01:07:16,433
Well, we're about to eat.

1006
01:07:17,392 --> 01:07:18,725
We'll be quick.

1007
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,642
And you must be Veronica.

1008
01:07:36,808 --> 01:07:38,350
It's Vanessa.

1009
01:07:39,183 --> 01:07:40,725
Oh, excuse me. Vanessa.

1010
01:07:41,517 --> 01:07:42,558
Go upstairs.

1011
01:07:52,767 --> 01:07:55,017
Gotham Hotel.
Twelve noon.

1012
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,017
[Maurice over phone]
<i>And what if he says no?</i>

1013
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,850
Well, sell it, god damn it.
He's got to go for it. It's gonna work,

1014
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:03,225
<i>but you got to tell him
the whole plan.</i>

1015
01:08:03,308 --> 01:08:06,267
Okay. I'll tell the boss.

1016
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:09,725
<i>Yeah, and also tell him that
he's got to show up in person.</i>

1017
01:08:09,808 --> 01:08:11,892
He's got to.
That's the only way this works.

1018
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,475
He says he can deliver
the code book

1019
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:23,642
and guarantee you 50,
maybe more.

1020
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:26,308
- A lot more.
- And what does he get?

1021
01:08:26,392 --> 01:08:30,142
Safe passage.
And five grand for himself.

1022
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:36,600
So the 50 isn't really 50,
it's 45.

1023
01:08:36,683 --> 01:08:38,308
[Maurice] At that price,
ain't it worth more

1024
01:08:38,392 --> 01:08:41,392
to just turn Goynes in
to Joe Finney?

1025
01:08:41,475 --> 01:08:44,975
And that other guy,
what's his name? Russo?

1026
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:50,808
That's more like
Capelli business.

1027
01:08:50,892 --> 01:08:53,975
Either way, what you
want me to tell Goynes?

1028
01:08:55,683 --> 01:08:57,308
Tell him...

1029
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,350
I'll be there.
With pleasure.

1030
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:06,933
[Ronald]
<i>A Cadillac convertible.</i>

1031
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:11,350
I was set up to die for the plans
for a Cadillac fucking convertible?

1032
01:09:11,433 --> 01:09:14,767
It's what I heard,
that's all I know.

1033
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,392
See, Frank,
now I know you're lying.

1034
01:09:18,475 --> 01:09:22,267
Because I happen to know it's
about some new exhaust system.

1035
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,183
Well, maybe it's an exhaust
system for a Cadillac convertible.

1036
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:27,308
What fucking difference
does it make?

1037
01:09:27,392 --> 01:09:31,058
We were hired to steal some car
shit, we stole some car shit.

1038
01:09:31,142 --> 01:09:33,517
Why are you even here?
What do you want?

1039
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,267
Because I have
a proposition for you.

1040
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:40,267
Okay, I'm going in my pocket.

1041
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:53,683
But first, I need you to admit you
picked me for this babysitting job.

1042
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:57,600
Now, I'll admit I know
why you want me gone.

1043
01:09:57,683 --> 01:09:59,725
Just like you know why
I want you gone.

1044
01:09:59,808 --> 01:10:02,142
I never aced you for my job.

1045
01:10:02,225 --> 01:10:04,308
I was in line,
and you know it.

1046
01:10:04,392 --> 01:10:05,767
Well, you might've
been in line,

1047
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:07,767
but you were walking
the wrong direction.

1048
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,683
It's never your fault, is it?
Is it?

1049
01:10:10,767 --> 01:10:14,517
And since you're so sure about
why I apparently want you dead,

1050
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,767
you might want to get yourself
checked for the clap.

1051
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:20,392
Consider it a gift
from me to you

1052
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:24,183
through my lovely
wife "Veronica."

1053
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:26,100
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1054
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:30,683
She already told me.

1055
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:33,558
And I could kill you,
but I'd rather give you a trophy.

1056
01:10:33,642 --> 01:10:35,183
You can have her.

1057
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:39,017
Frank. Frank, she's way
out of my league.

1058
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,933
[laughs] Okay.

1059
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:42,017
She's your wife.

1060
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,642
Yeah. Exactly. Fine.

1061
01:10:44,725 --> 01:10:48,475
Now that we've established
a line of open communication,

1062
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:51,433
okay, why don't you tell me
what your proposition is?

1063
01:10:51,517 --> 01:10:54,600
[Ronald] Okay. Here's the deal.

1064
01:11:02,433 --> 01:11:04,392
Where's the other half?

1065
01:11:04,475 --> 01:11:06,642
Goynes wants 50 grand
for the whole thing.

1066
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:08,058
Fifty?

1067
01:11:08,142 --> 01:11:10,600
[Ronald] Yeah,
but I got a plan.

1068
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,892
He thinks you'll think
it's a drop in the bucket

1069
01:11:12,975 --> 01:11:15,808
just to keep whatever deal
you got going on track.

1070
01:11:17,642 --> 01:11:19,058
But here's what I think.

1071
01:11:21,642 --> 01:11:23,475
You call Jones off the case.

1072
01:11:23,558 --> 01:11:26,517
We meet the moulinyan
at Cafe Roma, 08:30.

1073
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,600
He brings the other half.
We do the trade,

1074
01:11:30,683 --> 01:11:34,392
then we dump Goynes,
and we split the cash.

1075
01:11:34,475 --> 01:11:36,142
Split?

1076
01:11:36,267 --> 01:11:39,767
Yeah. My 25 comes out
of the bounty,

1077
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:42,183
which I deserve because
I'm salvaging your deal

1078
01:11:42,267 --> 01:11:44,392
and delivering the black guy.

1079
01:11:44,475 --> 01:11:47,725
You ask me, he's worth more
than the whole thing.

1080
01:11:49,058 --> 01:11:51,100
Why is that?

1081
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:54,767
Goynes has Watkins' code book
on him at all times.

1082
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,308
The code book.

1083
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:58,183
You ask me,

1084
01:11:58,267 --> 01:12:00,517
he's running some
side game with it.

1085
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:06,767
Then we're done.

1086
01:12:09,683 --> 01:12:10,725
Well...

1087
01:12:11,683 --> 01:12:13,267
Then, uh, okay,

1088
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:16,058
I heard you guys are
shorthanded in Reno.

1089
01:12:16,142 --> 01:12:18,017
Maybe you send me out there.

01:12:20,558 --> 01:12:22,142
I would... I would like...

1091
01:12:22,225 --> 01:12:25,267
Frank, I would like
something permanent.

1092
01:12:27,308 --> 01:12:29,183
I can walk forward, Frank.

1093
01:12:32,642 --> 01:12:33,767
Fuck!

1094
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,725
I just need a place
to start from. You know?

1095
01:12:39,017 --> 01:12:41,517
Let's take care
of this first, okay?

1096
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,600
Okay.

1097
01:12:44,308 --> 01:12:45,350
Thank you, Frank.

1098
01:12:51,558 --> 01:12:53,100
You are fucking him.
I was right.

1099
01:12:53,183 --> 01:12:56,475
- What?
- [Frank] He just confirmed it.

1100
01:12:56,558 --> 01:12:58,017
Frank, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1101
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,100
I wouldn't... I don't...

1102
01:12:59,183 --> 01:13:00,892
He just fucking admitted to it.

1103
01:13:00,975 --> 01:13:04,600
Frank, I would never do that!
No, please, no! Please, please!

some bigger deal

1108
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,183
that he's not letting on to?

[chuckles]

1111

Hey, you think that Reno's
gonna put up with this

1112

- Pour you some Chianti?
- Nah.

Wine is good for you.
Ask Jesus.

Yeah, well, so's a clear head.
Ask Pontius Pilate.

Nice to see you again, Curtis.

1125
01:14:40,808 --> 01:14:43,183
- You got the fifty?
- Yeah, right here.

1126
01:14:43,267 --> 01:14:44,225
You got the two halves

1127

- of the document?
- Mmm-hmm.

1128
01:14:45,517 --> 01:14:48,100
Let's dispense
with the bullshit.

1129
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:49,767
We got the document.

1130
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,975
You want it and it's yours.

1131
01:14:52,058 --> 01:14:55,142
For a price.
But it's a new price.

1132
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:59,017
What new price?

1133
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,308
Twice the bounty
you getting for us.

- Really? 90,000?
- That's right.

1136
01:15:04,517 --> 01:15:06,142
- Ninety?
- Fifty, forty.

1137
01:15:06,225 --> 01:15:09,017
- You're not serious?
- Yeah, I'm dead serious.

1138
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:14,142
Well, it's not my money,
so I'll of course have to get it approved.

1139
01:15:14,225 --> 01:15:16,142
- From who?
- Who the fuck do you think?

1140
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:17,642
- The people that I need...
- No, no, no, no, no.

...to get to
approve everything.

- We're gonna sell it

- Hands on the table.

Oh, Ronald.

1146
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:32,142
It's not my fault.
Frank fucked us.

1147
01:15:32,225 --> 01:15:34,725
You see, Ron, the problem is
you're not smart enough

1148
01:15:34,808 --> 01:15:36,475
to know how not smart you are.

1149
01:15:36,558 --> 01:15:39,725
Which makes you unpredictable.
Which makes you untrustworthy.

1150
01:15:39,808 --> 01:15:41,475
And sloppy.

1151
01:15:41,558 --> 01:15:44,392
- Sloppy?
- You fucking heard me.

1152

This whole fucking thing
is offensive. Let's go.

Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Where are we going?

[Jones] Get up!

Where are we gonna go?

1156
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:53,767
Well, it ain't gonna
be no place good, Ronald.

1157
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,350
- Where are we gonna go?
- But, you, know...

1158
01:15:55,433 --> 01:15:56,475
- Okay.

Who sent you, Frank? Huh?

ask you again?

that fucking document?

I'll sit in the back.
I'll be fine.

1243
01:21:07,017 --> 01:21:08,100
Sorry.

1244
01:21:10,683 --> 01:21:14,600
No. No. It's not your fault.

1245
01:21:19,017 --> 01:21:20,100
Okay?

1246
01:21:21,975 --> 01:21:23,475
We all make choices.

1247
01:21:25,392 --> 01:21:29,142
And your dad's gonna have to deal
with the consequences of his.

1248
01:21:29,225 --> 01:21:31,933
But you did what you did,
and it was the right thing.

1249
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:36,892
[wristwatch clicking]

1250
01:21:38,892 --> 01:21:39,892
What?

1251
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:46,558
If we stop at Naismith,
we're selling ourselves short.

1252
01:21:48,308 --> 01:21:50,475
Actually, I was thinking
the same thing.

1253
01:21:50,558 --> 01:21:51,600
[Curt laughs]

1254
01:21:53,433 --> 01:21:54,517
I was.

1255
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,183
All right, listen,
the point is,

1256
01:21:57,267 --> 01:21:59,350
there's somebody above Naismith

1257
01:21:59,433 --> 01:22:00,850
and there's somebody
above Forbert.

1258
01:22:00,933 --> 01:22:03,267
And that's who we should
be dealing with.

1259
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:06,017
- So, what? Ditch Naismith?
- No.

1260
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,517
- Ditch 125,000?
- No, no, no.

1261
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,933
- Come on.
- I'm not saying that.

1262
01:22:10,017 --> 01:22:11,058
- That's crazy.
- No, no.

1263
01:22:11,142 --> 01:22:12,600
We're not ditching nothing.

1264
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:16,100
We adding. Whoever they trying
to hide this thing from.

1265
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,225
Let's not get greedy, Goynes.

1266
01:22:20,183 --> 01:22:21,433
I need more.

1267
01:22:24,642 --> 01:22:26,392
Never satisfied, huh?

1268
01:22:28,058 --> 01:22:30,558
All right. Forget it.
You don't want to partake,

1269
01:22:30,642 --> 01:22:31,892
you definitely don't have to.

1270
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:33,600
That is not what I'm saying.

1271
01:22:35,142 --> 01:22:39,392
It's fucking bold.
Fucking bold.

1272
01:22:39,475 --> 01:22:41,808
[Mel] <i>Okay, okay, okay.
Where, then?</i>

1273
01:22:41,892 --> 01:22:44,767
[Louise] <i>Anywhere. Sandusky.</i>

1274
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:48,183
Maybe Toledo. Maybe we
can move back to Detroit.

1275
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:49,600
Look, Louise, listen,

1276
01:22:49,683 --> 01:22:51,933
I need you
to think about this rationally.

1277
01:22:52,017 --> 01:22:54,975
There's no logical reason for
them ever to come back here.

1278
01:22:55,058 --> 01:22:57,058
Look, they got
the thing they wanted.

1279
01:22:57,142 --> 01:22:59,308
I literally have nothing
they need.

1280
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:00,642
Well, that's not exactly true.

1281
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:03,225
[Louise gasps]

1282
01:23:03,308 --> 01:23:06,350
- Sir, we'd like to know actually...
- Shh, shh, shh.

1283
01:23:06,433 --> 01:23:08,308
- We would like to know...
- Hey.

1284
01:23:08,392 --> 01:23:09,975
Do... Do I know you?

1285
01:23:13,683 --> 01:23:16,350
No idea what you're
talking about, buddy.

1286
01:23:17,558 --> 01:23:19,475
Listen, who paid you?

1287
01:23:19,558 --> 01:23:21,183
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

1288
01:23:21,267 --> 01:23:25,600
Who paid you
to hide the document?

1289
01:23:25,683 --> 01:23:27,850
[receptionist] <i>Mike Lowen's
office, how may I help you?</i>

1290
01:23:27,933 --> 01:23:30,475
Yeah, it's Mel Forbert
for Mr. Lowen.

1291
01:23:30,558 --> 01:23:32,475
Please tell him it's urgent.

1292
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:52,433
You cancel the rental car?

1293
01:23:53,725 --> 01:23:55,225
What do you think, Matt?

1294
01:23:57,517 --> 01:23:59,850
I think you did.
Of course you did.

1295
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,058
Uh-uh.

1296
01:24:03,183 --> 01:24:04,683
Nope.

1297
01:24:04,767 --> 01:24:07,142
- Really?
- Yeah, I kept the car.

1298
01:24:07,267 --> 01:24:09,267
And the appointment
with the realtor.

1299
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,558
- You did?
- [knocking on door]

1300
01:24:13,642 --> 01:24:17,975
Paula? Paula, what about
the desk? Everything?

1301
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:21,225
Just the third drawer,
everything else can stay.

1302
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:25,892
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Phil.

1303
01:24:29,392 --> 01:24:30,642
[door closes]

1304
01:24:30,725 --> 01:24:32,350
You're going...
You're going with Phil?

1305
01:24:32,433 --> 01:24:38,850
Phil. You had a good idea.
California. So...

1306
01:24:38,933 --> 01:24:41,975
Maybe one day we'll see you
and Mary out there.

1307
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:06,725
He was early.
And he came alone.

1308
01:25:06,808 --> 01:25:08,892
- That's good.
- Confident man.

1309
01:25:08,975 --> 01:25:10,892
Certainly gives
that impression.

1310
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:51,850
Mike Lowen.
Afternoon, Mike Lowen.

1311
01:25:53,517 --> 01:25:55,142
You don't remember, do you?

1312
01:26:00,225 --> 01:26:03,267
Staked out the liquor,
which is, counterintuitively,

1313
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:05,017
not entirely terrible.

1314
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,642
Pour you boys something?

1315
01:26:06,725 --> 01:26:10,142
- [Curt] Nothing for me.
- I'll trust you on that scotch.

1316
01:26:10,225 --> 01:26:12,308
Excellent choice.

1317
01:26:12,392 --> 01:26:14,183
You should have seen the look
on my face when my caddie

1318
01:26:14,267 --> 01:26:16,683
came running
across that fairway.

1319
01:26:16,767 --> 01:26:19,308
I never show up anywhere
on short notice,

1320
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:23,892
just ask my wife,
and yet here I am.

1321
01:26:24,892 --> 01:26:27,850
Here we are. Congratulations.

1322
01:26:32,933 --> 01:26:34,183
This moment...

1323
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:39,100
stings like a motherfucker.

1324
01:27:03,642 --> 01:27:05,808
Of course, we're gonna
have to count it.

1325
01:27:08,142 --> 01:27:10,183
I'll do my arithmetics
right there.

1326
01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:17,100
Excuse me.

1327
01:27:41,975 --> 01:27:44,142
[Lowen] <i>So where'd we blow it?</i>

1328
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:47,058
<i>What's the, uh, what's the word
I'm looking for?</i>

1329
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:49,433
<i>The bridge between you and me?</i>

1330
01:27:49,517 --> 01:27:51,725
<i>Who was it?
How did we get to this place?</i>

1331
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:55,725
What does any
of this matter right now?

1332
01:27:55,808 --> 01:27:58,183
Well, I believe all truths
must be acknowledged,

1333
01:27:58,267 --> 01:28:00,017
however painful they are,

1334
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,975
or else there's no growth.

1335
01:28:02,058 --> 01:28:05,225
And growth is the key.
Growth! Progress!

1336
01:28:05,308 --> 01:28:08,475
Of course there's no growth
without reach,

1337
01:28:08,558 --> 01:28:13,683
and the risk being overreach.

1338
01:28:13,767 --> 01:28:19,267
So what I want to know is where
was it my guys, my structure,

1339
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:22,808
my weak links, my overreach,

1340
01:28:22,892 --> 01:28:26,350
and where was it
I was just simply outplayed?

1341
01:28:26,433 --> 01:28:29,100
Well, all that
really matters is

1342
01:28:29,183 --> 01:28:31,100
we're here, like you said,

1343
01:28:31,183 --> 01:28:33,850
and, uh, we know everything.

1344
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:36,267
What do you know?

1345
01:28:37,475 --> 01:28:39,142
If I may.

1346
01:28:39,225 --> 01:28:41,642
I mean, it's a hefty bite and I
want to know what I'm paying for.

1347
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:51,142
Black Bottom. Paradise Valley.
You heard of 'em?

1348
01:28:53,683 --> 01:28:56,267
You leveled
entire neighborhoods.

1349
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:57,767
You tore up the trolley tracks

1350
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:01,058
and now you got this redlining
bullshit everywhere.

1351
01:29:01,142 --> 01:29:03,808
Where are people
supposed to live, Mike?

1352
01:29:03,892 --> 01:29:06,933
The country is re-landscaping
itself, gentlemen.

1353
01:29:07,017 --> 01:29:09,392
I hate to break it to you,
this is happening everywhere.

1354
01:29:09,475 --> 01:29:12,058
A hundred cities and counting.
So again...

1355
01:29:12,142 --> 01:29:14,058
- [Curt] Yeah.
- What am I paying for?

1356
01:29:14,142 --> 01:29:15,225
And you got no control.

1357
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:16,850
[Lowen] I did not
create the river,

1358
01:29:16,933 --> 01:29:18,725
I am simply paddling the raft.

1359
01:29:18,808 --> 01:29:19,933
Hmm.

1360
01:29:20,017 --> 01:29:22,475
[Lowen] So again,
what am I paying for?

1361
01:29:22,558 --> 01:29:25,933
Same thing you paid
Forbert for. Silence.

1362
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,267
[Lowen] About?

1363
01:29:30,058 --> 01:29:31,558
You know what about.

1364
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,933
There is no conclusive evidence

1365
01:29:37,017 --> 01:29:38,350
that the automobile
has anything to do

1366
01:29:38,433 --> 01:29:40,142
with the pollution levels
in Los Angeles,

1367
01:29:40,225 --> 01:29:42,808
or in any other city
on the planet for that matter.

1368
01:29:42,892 --> 01:29:45,642
And the catalytic converter
will never be scaled to a size

1369
01:29:45,725 --> 01:29:48,517
where it makes any sense
under the hood of any car.

1370
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,725
[phone ringing]

1371
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:55,350
- Ah. I'll get it.
- [ringing continues]

1372
01:29:57,975 --> 01:29:59,433
[Curt] Tell him to sit tight.

1373
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,225
[ringing continues]

1374
01:30:07,475 --> 01:30:08,933
Yes.

1375
01:30:09,017 --> 01:30:10,517
<i>Uh, this is Naismith.</i>

1376
01:30:11,767 --> 01:30:12,725
[sighs]

1377
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,892
Sit tight, Hugh.

1378
01:30:25,058 --> 01:30:26,225
[Lowen] <i>Quite a grab.</i>

1379
01:30:27,975 --> 01:30:31,642
As long as we're talking about
overreach. I give Studebaker...

1380
01:30:31,725 --> 01:30:35,183
No, sorry, "Studebaker-Packard"
a year, two tops,

1381
01:30:35,267 --> 01:30:36,183
even with the merger.

1382
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:42,808
Fine, I'll address it to him.
Finally this makes sense.

1383
01:30:45,142 --> 01:30:47,350
The clown, Naismith,

1384
01:30:47,433 --> 01:30:50,225
somehow hears the Big Four
are working together.

1385
01:30:50,308 --> 01:30:52,433
On what, he just has to know.

1386
01:30:52,517 --> 01:30:54,892
Desperate to impress his bosses

1387
01:30:54,975 --> 01:30:59,850
who know nothing of his plan,
he hires who he hires.

1388
01:30:59,933 --> 01:31:01,267
They hire you.

1389
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:04,308
Somehow you sniff your way
to the head of the pack.

1390
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:09,058
And hence, the twain has met.

1391
01:31:09,142 --> 01:31:10,600
You and me.

1392
01:31:10,683 --> 01:31:16,433
Against all laws of history,
nature, class...

1393
01:31:16,517 --> 01:31:17,808
No, caste.

1394
01:31:17,892 --> 01:31:20,850
All right. How we looking
on the count, Ronald?

1395
01:31:22,933 --> 01:31:25,683
I count 375 even.

1396
01:31:30,808 --> 01:31:34,767
I know you think we are
playing by "your" rules,

1397
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:39,058
but let's be clear,
you do not "make" the rules, ever,

1398
01:31:39,142 --> 01:31:41,558
you follow them,
even when you think you have autonomy,

1399
01:31:41,642 --> 01:31:43,725
even when you think you have
control, that is an illusion,

1400
01:31:43,808 --> 01:31:47,392
you are under the illusion of
control, at all times, this is fact,

1401
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:48,975
it is a fact
you will never understand

1402
01:31:49,058 --> 01:31:50,725
and you will go to the grave
not understanding,

1403
01:31:50,808 --> 01:31:52,475
the same way I will
go to the grave

1404
01:31:52,558 --> 01:31:54,767
not understanding the genius
of God's magnificent universe

1405
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:57,850
because I did not create it.
But I and others like me

1406
01:31:57,933 --> 01:32:01,058
did create these rules,
in this world, on this field,

1407
01:32:01,142 --> 01:32:02,642
and you are playing by them now

1408
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:06,017
even if you walk out of here
with my money.

1409
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,308
Am I clear?

1410
01:32:07,392 --> 01:32:09,225
What is clear is that
we got your money.

1411
01:32:09,308 --> 01:32:12,808
Ah, it's money.
I have a lot of money.

1412
01:32:12,892 --> 01:32:14,642
I will continue
to have more still.

1413
01:32:14,725 --> 01:32:17,183
It's like a lizard tail.
Cut it off,

1414
01:32:17,267 --> 01:32:19,642
the damn thing just grows back.

1415
01:32:19,725 --> 01:32:24,308
I work, it grows.
I sleep, it grows.

1416
01:32:24,392 --> 01:32:28,058
In fact, however
we end up here,

1417
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:32,058
I'll go home,
I'll call my banker,

1418
01:32:32,142 --> 01:32:34,392
and I will sleep
like a baby tonight.

1419
01:32:39,725 --> 01:32:42,100
You still don't remember,
do you?

1420
01:32:46,308 --> 01:32:48,767
Don't blame you,
it was years ago

1421
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:50,975
and I was one
of a panel of four.

1422
01:32:51,058 --> 01:32:52,517
I was at Ford at the time.

1423
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,183
We were trying to recruit you
just out of the service.

1424
01:32:55,267 --> 01:32:58,058
Hard sell. I guess GM
made a better pitch.

1425
01:32:58,142 --> 01:33:02,642
- [Curt] Hmm.
- Okay, you got me.

1426
01:33:02,725 --> 01:33:07,808
Yes, I remember you.
Michael Lowenstein. With the thing.

1427
01:33:07,892 --> 01:33:11,892
Umlaut. Lowenstein.
I'm Swedish.

1428
01:33:13,267 --> 01:33:16,517
The "stein,"
I found misperceived,

1429
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,808
as you can imagine,
inhibited some of the traction

1430
01:33:19,892 --> 01:33:21,392
I needed for our
overseas business

1431
01:33:21,475 --> 01:33:22,808
the last few decades.

1432
01:33:22,892 --> 01:33:24,975
And it wasn't entirely
helpful here, either.

1433
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:27,517
I'm sure you can understand.

1434
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,225
Oh, yes, "stein",
real drawback.

1435
01:33:30,308 --> 01:33:33,225
Certainly you do, Mr. "Russo."

1436
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:35,600
All right, enough.
The money's here,

1437
01:33:35,683 --> 01:33:38,267
we're leaving. You can too.

1438
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,017
Then I shall get my hat.

1439
01:33:50,267 --> 01:33:52,892
That was a watershed year
for me. That year.

1440
01:33:52,975 --> 01:33:55,558
1928. I thought...

1441
01:33:55,642 --> 01:33:57,767
we're losing guys to GM now?

1442
01:33:57,850 --> 01:33:59,767
That same year,
they surpassed us in sales.

1443
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:03,225
We, who invented the whole damn
thing, became an underdog.

1444
01:34:12,767 --> 01:34:15,100
Well, I left Ford
later that year.

1445
01:34:15,183 --> 01:34:18,808
Decided I'd put my chips on
the industry as a whole.

1446
01:34:18,892 --> 01:34:21,600
Smart. Individual companies,
to me?

1447
01:34:21,683 --> 01:34:23,767
It's a distinction
without a difference.

1448
01:34:34,308 --> 01:34:38,475
I remain agnostic as to how
they choose their pecking order.

1449
01:34:38,558 --> 01:34:41,142
And I create some space for
them to spread their wings.

1450
01:34:41,225 --> 01:34:42,142
It works well.

1451
01:34:42,225 --> 01:34:43,850
So far.

1452
01:34:43,933 --> 01:34:45,558
There's a mutual trust.

1453
01:34:45,642 --> 01:34:47,475
I believe you have
something of mine.

1454
01:35:03,808 --> 01:35:05,350
He's got the other half.

1455
01:35:29,767 --> 01:35:32,183
Mutual trust.

1456
01:35:32,267 --> 01:35:35,683
You know what I love? When characters
you've long since forgotten

1457
01:35:35,767 --> 01:35:37,850
in this great novel called Life
show up at the end

1458
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:40,433
and the whole story
gets filled right in.

1459
01:35:40,517 --> 01:35:42,642
Good to meet you both.
Individualists.

1460
01:35:42,725 --> 01:35:45,142
Defiers of rules.
Two men who, against all odds,

1461
01:35:45,225 --> 01:35:46,850
somehow arrived
in the same spot,

1462
01:35:46,933 --> 01:35:49,683
from entirely different places.
Reach, gentlemen.

1463
01:35:50,517 --> 01:35:51,808
Reach for the moon!

1464
01:36:02,183 --> 01:36:03,558
So GM, huh?

1465
01:36:05,017 --> 01:36:06,767
That was a long time ago.

1466
01:36:16,058 --> 01:36:18,933
Good. Now let's go
get that Naismith money.

1467
01:36:19,017 --> 01:36:22,392
Oh, no.
This is as far as I go.

1468
01:36:22,475 --> 01:36:24,058
What do you mean, "Oh, no"?

1469
01:36:24,142 --> 01:36:27,100
I'm done. You can have the
Naismith money all to yourself.

1470
01:36:27,183 --> 01:36:29,100
So you're just gonna
abandon the plan?

1471
01:36:31,183 --> 01:36:33,183
You just don't know
when to stop, huh?

1472
01:36:33,267 --> 01:36:34,142
[knocking on door]

1473
01:37:00,683 --> 01:37:01,975
It's the bellhop.

1474
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:05,683
- Lonnie?
- Yeah.

1475
01:37:05,767 --> 01:37:06,808
Let him in.

1476
01:37:16,433 --> 01:37:17,558
Sorry, Ronald.

1477
01:37:34,142 --> 01:37:35,308
Aldrick.

1478
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:37,600
Curtis.

1479
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,183
What's... What's going on, man?

1480
01:37:54,433 --> 01:37:57,642
- Aldrick, it's all right there.
- Let's go.

1481
01:37:59,975 --> 01:38:01,475
I'm sorry, man.

1482
01:38:02,683 --> 01:38:05,017
Aldrick.

1483
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,100
Aldrick, I put this whole thing
together for you, man.

1484
01:38:07,183 --> 01:38:08,683
You're not gonna
take that money?

1485
01:38:08,767 --> 01:38:14,225
That money is too expensive.
I got what I want.

1486
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,475
So? How'd it go?

1487
01:38:42,558 --> 01:38:44,808
[Ronald breathing heavily]

1488
01:38:44,892 --> 01:38:48,767
It broke my way, baby.
It broke my way.

1489
01:38:50,308 --> 01:38:51,225
[Vanessa squeals excitedly]

1490
01:38:51,308 --> 01:38:53,808
Oh, look at those. Ronald!

1491
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:58,808
There's more?

1492
01:39:03,058 --> 01:39:04,350
How much is this?

1493
01:39:05,642 --> 01:39:07,350
375, baby.

1494
01:39:08,683 --> 01:39:10,308
375?

1495
01:39:10,392 --> 01:39:11,475
Yeah.

1496
01:39:12,975 --> 01:39:15,142
I have 31. That's...

1497
01:39:15,225 --> 01:39:19,225
That's $406,000.

1498
01:39:19,308 --> 01:39:21,808
Ronald, I can't believe it.

1499
01:39:21,892 --> 01:39:26,433
How did you... How did
you manage this? I can't...

1500
01:39:26,517 --> 01:39:30,017
Oh, my gosh, Ronald, baby.

1501
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:32,392
Oh, my goodness.
We could do anything.

1502
01:39:32,475 --> 01:39:35,142
We could go anywhere.
Around the world.

1503
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:38,225
Oh, we could even take
an airplane, Ronald.

1504
01:39:38,308 --> 01:39:43,225
We could take ten airplanes if
we wanted to. I mean, I just...

1505
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,683
You did it.

1506
01:39:47,767 --> 01:39:50,267
We're not there yet. Here.

1507
01:40:07,517 --> 01:40:10,308
- Where's the car?
- Spot 5.

1508
01:40:10,392 --> 01:40:13,642
Okay, get it and wait for me
at the entrance.

1509
01:40:13,725 --> 01:40:14,975
Okay.

1510
01:40:15,058 --> 01:40:17,100
No, no, no. I got that one.

1511
01:40:17,183 --> 01:40:18,392
[Vanessa] Okay.

1512
01:40:20,267 --> 01:40:21,808
I'll be right behind you.

1513
01:40:45,725 --> 01:40:49,267
- Aldrick.
- [Watkins] Hello, Joe.

1514
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:51,017
[Finney] Chatty little bird
in a tall tree

1515
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:53,058
said you might have
something of mine.

1516
01:40:53,142 --> 01:40:57,975
So, I suppose
I should thank you.

1517
01:40:58,058 --> 01:41:02,725
Before you do, let me
play out two scenarios.

1518
01:41:02,808 --> 01:41:05,600
And to be clear,
both end with

1519
01:41:05,683 --> 01:41:07,892
Curtis Goynes dead.

1520
01:41:07,975 --> 01:41:14,142
Scenario one, you solve
the murder of Charley Barnes,

1521
01:41:15,433 --> 01:41:19,433
Douglas Jones,
and Frank Capelli.

1522
01:41:19,517 --> 01:41:22,725
After an arduous trial
that plunges an already

1523
01:41:22,808 --> 01:41:26,725
racially-divided Detroit
into chaos,

1524
01:41:26,808 --> 01:41:28,517
you get a promotion of

1525
01:41:29,433 --> 01:41:33,892
a thousand a year? If that?

1526
01:41:33,975 --> 01:41:38,475
And I make sure
Goynes dies in prison.

1527
01:41:38,558 --> 01:41:42,642
Or number two.
You still solve the murders,

1528
01:41:42,725 --> 01:41:45,058
but the perp himself

1529
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:49,892
is taken care of by his own.

1530
01:41:49,975 --> 01:41:51,892
Which leaves you a hero

1531
01:41:51,975 --> 01:41:55,392
and which sets an example
to others like him

1532
01:41:55,475 --> 01:42:00,142
that might be tempted to
play outside of their league.

1533
01:42:01,558 --> 01:42:07,142
And instead of 25 grand

1534
01:42:07,225 --> 01:42:09,475
that trickles out over
the rest of your life,

1535
01:42:09,558 --> 01:42:12,725
you get a bonus,
paid instantly,

1536
01:42:12,808 --> 01:42:14,850
that equals twice that.

1537
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:41,767
[announcer on radio] <i>No runs,
two hits for the Senators.</i>

1538
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:43,725
<i>No runs, no hits for Detroit.</i>

1539
01:42:43,808 --> 01:42:46,683
<i>Beautiful day here
at Briggs Stadium.</i>

1540
01:42:46,767 --> 01:42:49,433
<i>Couple of scattered clouds
out there.</i>

1541
01:42:49,517 --> 01:42:52,600
<i>But all in all, a gorgeous day,
and why not play two, and we will,</i>

1542
01:42:52,683 --> 01:42:55,808
<i>a double header
scheduled today.</i>

1543
01:42:55,892 --> 01:42:59,100
<i>As the first one from Schmitz
misses outside.</i>

1544
01:42:59,183 --> 01:43:01,475
<i>One ball and no strikes,</i>

1545

<i>didn't quite connect there

1546
01:43:12,808 --> 01:43:14,475
Finally!

1547
01:43:14,558 --> 01:43:19,517
Can you believe it's 45 cents
to park with no grace period?

1548
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,058
- Did you bring a map?
- It's in the glove compartment.

1549
01:43:23,142 --> 01:43:24,642
That's my girl.

1550

Well, may I ask

Please step out of the car.

It's all there.

Uh, you'd said $375,000 but I
think you made a little mistake.

The actual number
is 406 and change.

I must've miscounted.

is pretty good.

ask you something.

What made you think
that you could trust me?

1607

You can be trusted, Aldrick.

I took the 25 I staked
you back then, plus interest.
