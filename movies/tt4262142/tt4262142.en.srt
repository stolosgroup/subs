              Hi.

1394
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:28,909
     So did you find Joey?

1395
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:32,480
      Um...I think maybe
     you should sit down.

          Joey's foster parents
                    adopted him

01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,252
                    when he was

1398
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:39,520

1399
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:41,956
                  that it's not
           in his best interest

    of a supervised visit.

       was best for him.
