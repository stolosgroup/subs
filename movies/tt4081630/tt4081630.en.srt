- I had the speech. I had rehearsed.

156
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:52,303
It was gonna be great and then,
you know, well… her mom died.

157
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,158
- Her mom died, then she got depressed.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:55,810
Yeah, it was a rough situation, okay?

159
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:58,148
I'm just waiting for her
to get her sea legs back,

160
00:10:58,232 --> 00:10:59,442
and then I'm gonna tell her.

161
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,029
You know it's been a year?

162
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:03,158
Literally.

163
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:04,160
[sighs]

164
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:07,960
Today's our anniversary.
And if you don't hate me, I have presents.

165
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,043
Mmm.

166
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:10,757
[mouthing words]

167
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,761
Okay.

168
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:18,940
Now, I got some sparkly stuff too,
but this is what I'm most excited about.

169
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:20,986
[paper rustling]

170
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:26,622
It's Bette Davis's journal
from when she was shooting Now, Voyager.

171
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,920
That's... That's the movie
where I fell in love with her.

172
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:31,924
- Yeah.
- How did you know that?

173
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,137
Well, I listen.

174
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:37,310
And… [chuckles] …I did a little research.

175
00:11:38,437 --> 00:11:39,439
You like it?

176
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,069
It's perfect.

177
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:43,865
[chuckles]

178
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:48,498
Goodbye, Vincent.

179
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,256
[footsteps departing]

180
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,342
[door opens]

181
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:54,705
- Goodbye, Vin...
- [door closes]

182
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:57,976
[sighs]

183
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,062
[phone beeps]

184
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:03,236
[sobbing] Okay. Okay. Okay.

185
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,286
[whispering] Oli... Olivia!

186
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,457
I just need a little more time.

187
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:20,981
I don't get it.
This place was on fire last night.

188
00:12:21,064 --> 00:12:23,360
Rocky says Chateau is dead too.

189
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:25,865
I'm calling it.

190
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,496
- Please don't go out front.
- Please don't follow me.

191
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:37,304
- You're being reckless.
- You're being reckless.

192
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:40,812
[Vincent] Olivia!

193
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:42,314
[Olivia] Don't follow me!

194
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:43,609
Dave?

195
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,154
- Billie Jean King?
- Yep.

196
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,542
- [grunts]
- [Olivia] Oh!

197
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,378
- Oh, my word!
- [Antonio] What...

198
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:56,318
- Are you all right? Are you okay?
- [Antonio] Yes, I'm just embarrassed.

199
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,931
I never thought
I would get hit by a parked car.

200
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:01,812
The hell, man? This is my mom's car!

201
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:04,209
- I'm sorry. I will pay for the damage.
- People are looking.

202
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,822
No, no, no! No, no. No damage. No scratch.
Five stars.

203
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,534
Oh, nice.

204
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:11,206
- Can we please go up the stairs?
- This man needs our help.

205
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,812
- I'm okay. Don't worry about me.
- Yeah, see. Let's just go back inside.

206
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,756
- Are you sure?
- [Antonio] I just wanna go home.

207
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,634
[shutter clicking]

208
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:17,719
You...

209
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:20,098
Call me when you're divorced.

210
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,434
[shutter clicking]

211
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:38,636
[groans]

212
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,875
[bell chimes]

213
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,889
[in English]
Oh, you really are a safety risk.

214
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:46,020
I'm gonna throw in a couple of reflectors
so people can see you coming.

215
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:47,147
Hey, Lu.

216
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:51,197
[in English] one, eh, reflector.

217
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,577
Your Spanish is terrible.

218
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:54,746
[chuckles]

219
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,711
- It is as good as your English, sir.
- You wish.

220
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:59,338
She's taking night classes,

221
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:01,384
but I think not even all-day classes
would help.

222
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,514
My Spanish sucks.
It is a source of great shame.

223
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:05,560
Thank you for doing that
in front of my daughter.

224
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:06,562
Yeah.

225
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:08,082
You know they're trying to kick us out?

226
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:09,786
Some developer bought out the whole block.

227
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,987
[mouthing words]

228
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,659
[Natalie] Fifteen years,
and now they try to price us out.

229
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:17,458
All of us too.
Hope you like juice bars and spin classes.

230
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,923
They want to replace your bike shop
with bikes that don't go anywhere?

231
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:22,927
Yeah. [Chuckles]

232
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:25,182
Oh, hey. You know what?

233
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,689
Okay,
there's a city council meeting next week.

234
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:32,739
- We gotta pack the place out, okay?
- Okay. Good.

235
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:36,622
- [bell chimes]
- [sighs]

236
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:37,999
That mustache.

237
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,544
[chattering]

238
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,341
I'm too much work. And I know that.

239
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:46,975
Maybe I drew too hard a line, you know?
Maybe I should call him.

240
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:51,902
Is there someone else that you can talk to
who might know you better?

241
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:55,075
Jennifer Lawrence.
Aren't you two, like, best friends?

242
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,079
We were in a movie together.

243
00:15:57,162 --> 00:15:59,751
We played best friends.

244
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,422
I don't even think she liked me.

245
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:06,013
Okay. How about your mom?
She called again last week.

246
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:08,393
My mother was a drunk.
She embezzled from me.

247
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,482
I testified against her in court.
She went to jail.

248
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:14,321
You haven't googled me?

249
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:16,367
I-I will now.

250
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,833
Vanity Fair. Page 32.2018.

251
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,004
It's actually pretty good.

252
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,387
I mean, depressing.
But hopeful, ultimately.

253
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:29,393
The source close to the family is me.

254
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,821
What? No. No.

255
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:36,115
No!

256
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:39,748
- [Kathryn] How do you explain this?
- [Vincent] It's bullshit.

257
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:42,336
I've never met that woman once
in my entire life.

258
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,219
Look, I walked the councilman to his car
and, sure, did I notice her?

259
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,266
Maybe.
There were lots of celebrities there.

260
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,565
But there was also some Lakers there,
and I was really excited about that.

261
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:56,447
Says that you were having a lovers' spat.

262
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:58,661
I never said a word to her.

263
00:16:58,744 --> 00:16:59,996
Look, I mean, you can't even...

264
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,835
Just look at the picture for a second.
Look at the picture.

265
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:06,510
Let me... Sure, yeah, that's me,
definitely, but who's that other guy?

266
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,304
- That guy?
- She was with that guy.

267
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:09,724
[Kathryn] She was with that guy?

268
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,853
That guy.
They were the ones who were bickering.

269
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:13,273
They were in a whole thing.

270
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:15,545
And we were all watching,
and it was really...

271
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,249
It was kind of uncomfortable
for all of us.

272
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:18,867
Okay.

273
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:22,207
You must think that I am so stupid.

274
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,673
I don't think that you're stupid.
I would never call you stupid.

275
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:30,181
Kathryn, look, it's the press, okay?

276
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,895
The press always gets it wrong.
You know this.

277
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:34,566
[sighs]

278
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:38,532
I want to believe you.

279
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:41,495
You can believe me.
You can always believe me.

280
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,582
Look, I...

281
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:46,339
I know that I've made mistakes
in the past, I do,

282
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:50,890
but I'm happy, and I love you, and I would
never do anything to jeopardize that.

283
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,396
And I so wanna talk about this
later tonight. I do.

284
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,816
But obviously, I can't.

285
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:58,154
I love you. I'm...

286
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:02,622
I'm gonna call my lawyer from the car
because they owe us an apology.

287
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:03,707
[door closes]

288
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,922
[Olivia] Earhart opens in five days!

289
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:10,011
I can't... I can't have this
getting out there. I need it gone.

290
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:12,892
She's on a party plane to London
for her nephew's bar mitzvah.

291
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:13,977
Why is she...

292
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,061
[stammers]

293
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:17,819
Just tell her to call me the second
she lands! I need my publicist!

294
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:20,884
- [Amanda] She's saying, "Don't freak out."
- [Olivia] Of course I'm freaking out!

295
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,494
I'm having an anxiety attack!

296
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:24,541
These are very judgmental times.

297
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:27,755
You can't just be a good actress.
You have to be a good person too.

298
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,429
- Where the hell are my pills?
- Okay. Bottom left. Next to your retainer.

299
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:33,474
Okay, anticipate my needs.

300
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:38,986
I have three studios
circling this company,

301
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:40,629
waiting to see how the box office does.

302
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:43,494
If this movie tanks,
you can say goodbye to all of it.

303
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:47,795
The wellness days. The yoga retreats.
The free water. All of it! Everything!

304
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:49,089
Why isn't this opening?

305
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,055
She's gonna divorce me.

306
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:56,270
I'ma lose the company. She and her father,
they're gonna squeeze me out.

307
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:59,193
[sighs] Daniel, you're my lawyer.
I need you to fix this.

308
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:02,575
Well, we could create a time machine
and have you make better choices.

309
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,203
I pay you not to judge me.

310

- [paparazzo 2] Olivia, right here!

619
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:50,142
[paparazzo 1] Right here, right here!

620
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,836
[clamoring]

621
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,963
[shutters clicking]

622
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:56,261
[paparazzo 3] Olivia, right here,
right here! Right here, right here!

623
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,476
[shutters continue clicking]

624
00:37:06,365 --> 00:37:07,241
This way.

625
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,494
- Olivia, over here!
- Olivia!

626
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:11,100
- [paparazzo 4] Antonio!
- Shoulders back, core engaged and smile.

627
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:14,339
Just look natural, like you're looking
in the mirror. And this way.

628
00:37:14,422 --> 00:37:16,803
Hey! There's America's sweethearts.

629
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,850
Labels out. I don't want
an angry phone call later, Tony.

630
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:21,646
Let's go. The vultures are waiting.

631
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:23,566
[paparazzo 5] Come on.
Come on. One more shot.

632
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:31,958
[chattering on TV]

633
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:37,427
[in English]
I'm told you are wearing Galvan.

634
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:39,682
Oh, you look absolutely stunning.

635
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:41,101
Thank you so much.

636
00:37:41,184 --> 00:37:43,230
And, Antonio, this is your first premiere,
right?

637
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:44,859
[chattering continues]

638
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:48,073
I mean, it's pretty exciting, right?

639
00:37:57,634 --> 00:38:00,056
[in English] I have no idea
what either of you are saying.

640
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,266
- Olivia.
- Mm-hmm.

641
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:04,523
- New movie. New man. New company.
- [chuckles]

642
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:06,335
- This is a big year for you.
- [reporter] Antonio.

643
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,423
Thank you. Yeah, I mean, I'm...
It's just such an honor to…

644
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:09,447
[reporter] Antonio!

645
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,000
- [in English] …about an incredible woman.
- Hey.

646
00:38:24,354 --> 00:38:25,565
[chuckles]

647
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,621
[in English] …all started
with my great-great-grandmother,

648
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,877
who was really into aviation
and airplanes.

649
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:48,116
[in English]
I really wanted to explore that…

650
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,623
- [in English] Hi.
- Olivia.

651
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:59,162
[in English] Oh, thank you so much.

652
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:00,969
We're gonna go and watch the movie now.

653
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:08,985
[footsteps approaching]

654
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:22,428
I know you said you didn't want nothing,
but I brought you some just in case.

655
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,355
They were not charging for anything.

656
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:37,931
[Amelia Earhart's mother on screen]
I have a bad feeling, Meeley.

657
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,632
There's something
in the air that ain't right.

658
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:44,055
Remember the Iowa State Fair

659
00:39:45,976 --> 00:39:47,813
when I saw my first aircraft?

660
00:39:48,397 --> 00:39:51,236
It was a rickety old flivver,
and I was too scared to get on.

661
00:39:51,946 --> 00:39:55,369
But you took my hand,
and we went on together.

662
00:39:56,956 --> 00:39:59,586
Be with me again today
as I fly across the Pacific.

663
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:02,425
You're aces, Mom.

664
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,014
[Amanda] Hi. You look great. Let's go.

665
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:34,573
Um, here's your table.
Can I get you anything?

666
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:37,913
Yeah, a giant pizza. I'm starving.
I don't want any of this finger food.

667
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:40,501
- Already ordered.
- See? You're anticipating.

668
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:42,211
Mm-hmm.

669
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:43,800
Antonio, can I get you anything?

670
00:40:43,883 --> 00:40:45,970
I-I'm just here to support Olivia
on her big night.

671
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:47,473
Sweet.

672
00:40:48,016 --> 00:40:49,770
[Olivia] Where was that on the red carpet?

673
00:40:49,853 --> 00:40:53,110
I mean, he's not bad-looking,
but what am I missing?

674
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:57,118
Historically, the world's great lovers
haven't been attractive men.

675
00:40:57,201 --> 00:41:01,209
Casanova was ugly.
But in bed, he was a legend.

676
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,504
Hmm.

677
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:05,593
Well, we only have to stay for 20 minutes,
and then we can…

678
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:07,681
- Oh, my God.
- [Antonio] What?

679
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:08,975
- He's here…
- Who's here?

680
00:41:09,058 --> 00:41:10,328
- …with Kathryn.
- Who's Kathryn?

681
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:11,665
- Vincent's wife.
- Who's Vincent?

682
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:12,959
- The married man.
- What married man?

683
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:14,253
- My boyfriend.
- What boyfriend?

684
00:41:14,277 --> 00:41:15,947
I... This was all explained to you.

685
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,410
Uh, th-th-there were many names.
It was very confusing.

686
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:20,080
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Where are they?

687
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:22,185
They're over by the bar,
and she does not look depressed.

688
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:23,354
Does she look depressed to you?

689
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:25,132
[chattering]

690
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:34,651
[stammers] Well, maybe,
maybe her eyes look a little sad.

691
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:35,904
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

692
00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:37,991
- Oh, they're coming.
- Okay, um…

693
00:41:38,074 --> 00:41:40,138
Um, sh-sh-should I do something?
Should I hold your hand?

694
00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:42,392
Yeah, hold my hand. Hold my hand.
Hold my hand. Don't do that.

695
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,715
Just make... Kiss me... Make out with me.
Get away from me. Just get away.

696
00:41:45,798 --> 00:41:47,928
- Hi. [Chuckles] I'm Kathryn Royce.
- Hi.

697
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:49,890
- This is my husband, Vincent.
- Hi.

698
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:52,061
We've seen all of your movies.

699
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:53,271
That's so nice.

700
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:57,530
I have to tell you, though, I think that
this one might just be my favorite.

701
00:41:58,114 --> 00:41:59,618
It's very empowering.

702
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:03,333
Uh, honey, we shouldn't monopolize her.
Come on.

703
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,630
I just... I... I love this.

704
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:07,818
- [Vincent clears throat]
- The actress and the valet.

705
00:42:07,842 --> 00:42:12,017
I mean, we are dying to know
how the two of you met.

706
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:13,562
[Vincent, Olivia chuckle]

707
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:16,777
- Oh, well, I was driving in Beverly Hills…
- In Beverly Hills.

708
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,696
Ooh.

709
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:19,407
- …and I got a flat tire.
- Flat tire.

710
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,492
Oh, no. Ugh.

711
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:25,043
- This handsome man pulled up in a Ferrari.
- Me. Yeah. Ferrari. And…

712
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:26,927
- By the time he had the spare on…
- Spare on.

713
00:42:27,006 --> 00:42:30,429
- …I was smitten.
- Yeah. Mitten. She was very mitten.

714
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:32,057
- That is so sweet.
- You see that?

715
00:42:32,141 --> 00:42:33,662
- Look at that. Isn't that sweet?
- Yes.

716
00:42:33,686 --> 00:42:35,773
Yeah, see? Love always finds its way.

717
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:38,320
- Oh, he's such a romantic.
- [Vincent] Mm-hmm.

718
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:40,407
It was nice meeting you both. Take care.

719
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,328
- [Kathryn] Just out of curiosity…
- Shit.

720
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:47,839
…how long did it take for him to tell you
that he was just parking the car?

721
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,056
- I'm just here...
- Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

722
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:53,559
I really need to steal these two.

723
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:55,437
No, you know what? He told me right away,

724
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:58,611
and thank God, because I can't stand men
who have showy cars.

725
00:42:58,694 --> 00:43:03,996
Ah, you would hate Vincent then.
He has an entire garage just full of 'em.

726
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,541
- [Kathryn laughs]
- Okay.

727
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,354
- Uh, we really have to go, so, um...
- Yeah. Yeah.

728
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:09,298
I'm just here to support Olivia
on her big night.

729
00:43:09,382 --> 00:43:10,718
Uh-huh. Right this way. So sorry.

730
00:43:10,802 --> 00:43:12,054
[knocks on window]

731
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:13,431
[chuckles]

732
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,647
- Hey. Blast from the past, man.
- Hey.

733
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,732
What are you doing here?

734
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:21,907
Ah, you know, man. Someone's screwing
someone they're not supposed to. You?

735
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,080
Same. Homo sapiens, bro.
We're flawed creatures.

736
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:27,669
Hey, extra falafel. You want one?

737
00:43:27,752 --> 00:43:28,963
Is that Falafel King?

738
00:43:29,046 --> 00:43:30,382
Is it Falafel King?

739
00:43:30,465 --> 00:43:31,760
- Hell yeah.
- Come on, bro.

740
00:43:32,428 --> 00:43:33,471
- Come on, bro.
- [gasps]

741
00:43:33,556 --> 00:43:35,392
Oh, you know what? I forgot the napkins.

742
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:37,939
You still, uh, keep an extra stash
in the glove compartment?

743
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:40,945
I have upgraded to moist towelettes.

744
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:42,699
[chuckles] Love that.

745
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:50,673
- Perfect. Thanks, man.
- It's the best in the city.

746
00:43:50,757 --> 00:43:53,637
- They do not skimp on the tahini.
- Don't skimp on the tahini.

747
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:54,973
Oh, time flies. Gotta go.

748
00:43:55,056 --> 00:43:56,602
Oh. Thanks.

749
00:43:56,685 --> 00:43:58,396
- Where are my pills?
- It's in your hand.

750
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,482
Oh.

751
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:02,573
My apologies.
I thought this was the men's room.

752
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:03,616
She knows.

753
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:04,701
[Amanda clears throat]

754
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,291
All right. Okay.

755
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:12,675
Uh, I'm sorry.
Look, Kathryn got the tickets.

756
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:15,222
She sprung them on me at the last minute.

757
00:44:15,305 --> 00:44:17,267
[sighs] I'm in hell here.

758
00:44:17,351 --> 00:44:19,230
I should wait outside for this.

759
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:20,983
She's nothing like you described.

760
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:23,656
She's elegant. Regal.

761
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:25,660
- Why would you divorce someone like that?
- Why?

762
00:44:25,743 --> 00:44:27,622
Because I'm in love with you.

763
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:33,884
Because nothing I've ever done or said
or felt makes any sense without you.

764
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:38,727
There's a level of intimacy here
that's getting very uncomfortable for me,

765
00:44:38,811 --> 00:44:39,813
so I'm just...

766
00:44:39,896 --> 00:44:42,317
I had this whole narrative in my head
about how awful she was

767
00:44:42,401 --> 00:44:44,113
to justify my behavior.

768
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:45,282
But now I find out…

769
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,579
She's great at a cocktail party.

770
00:44:47,662 --> 00:44:49,791
Okay? But she's a monster at home.

771
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:53,172
[whispers] We're so close.
We're so close, Olivia.

772
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,387
She's totally buying all of this.

773
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:59,018
It's gonna be me and you.

774
00:45:00,521 --> 00:45:02,399
[sighs] I can't handle this.

775
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,738
You were incredible in the movie.

776
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:07,451
I know.

777
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,131
[sighs] I hate this job. [Sighs] Fuck.

778
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:20,853
Thanks, bro.

779
00:45:22,899 --> 00:45:23,901
[Olivia groans]

780
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:26,322
[raspberry]

781
00:45:30,706 --> 00:45:33,504
Whatever my husband is paying you,
I'll double it.

782
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:36,593
Fine. I'll quadruple it.

783
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:42,772
- I-I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'll give you $100,000.

784
00:45:46,487 --> 00:45:47,489
Cash.

785
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:54,253
There is no way that Olivia Allan
is wasting her time with a valet.

786
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:58,721
[scoffs]

787
00:46:00,098 --> 00:46:01,100
[huffs]

788
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:03,396
Ma'am,

789
00:46:04,398 --> 00:46:08,406
I don't get paid a lot,
so I would love to take your money.

790
00:46:09,617 --> 00:46:10,619
But I won't.

791
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:12,874
It's probably hard to believe,

792
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:16,715
but maybe Olivia
is not as superficial as you.

793
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,384
And maybe…

794
00:46:19,303 --> 00:46:23,144
Maybe you're underestimating the passion

795
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:26,777
and charisma of a Latin man.

796
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,130
[speaking Spanish] Buenas noches, señora.

797
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:47,982
[in English] Are you okay?

798
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:51,535
[slurred] Hello. [Chuckles]

799
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,373
I had one too many happy pills.

800
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:57,547
Five too many champagnes. [Chuckles]

801
00:46:58,882 --> 00:46:59,884
I wanna go home.

802
00:47:00,803 --> 00:47:03,224
Okay. I will call the limo.

803
00:47:03,307 --> 00:47:08,484
[slurred] No! No drunk Olivia photos.
Women's stories.

804
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:13,244
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Look. It's the valet guy.

805
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:14,873
Excuse me. Excuse me.

806
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:19,632
[cheering]

807
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:27,982
[in English]
Antonio, Antonio, I love you. I love you.

808
00:47:28,942 --> 00:47:29,986
I'm famous too.

809
00:47:30,696 --> 00:47:32,825
[cheering continues]

810
00:47:50,778 --> 00:47:51,821
[Antonio, in English] Hey.

811
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:09,941
[in English]
Olivia, we need your address. Wake up.

812
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:20,461
[in English] Hey, Olivia.

813
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,814
[reporter, in English]
I need me an Olivia Allan shot.

814
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:42,840
It's good for the resume.

815
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:44,886
[reporter 2]
She's gotta be coming out soon.

816
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:15,656
[Rudy, in English]
Two eggs and cheese and an English muffin.

817
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:20,874
And some hash browns and…

818
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:37,573
[in English] Okay.

819
00:49:53,732 --> 00:49:55,694
[in English] Okay. Um… [smacks lips]

820
00:49:57,113 --> 00:49:58,113
Okay.

821
00:50:00,871 --> 00:50:02,433
- [Olivia, in English] Hey!
- [all scream]

822
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:06,215
Uh, O-O-Olivia, uh, these are my friends,
Javy and Rudy.

823
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:08,177
- Hey.
- [slurred] Rudy.

824
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,223
- [Rudy] Yeah. Yeah.
- Rudy's a cutie.

825
00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:11,726
- Me?
- [Olivia] You're a cutie.

826
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:14,815
- We need to know your addr...
- You should go home with my assistant.

827
00:50:15,651 --> 00:50:18,155
- Her name is Amanda. She's very beautiful.
- You...

828
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,702
We need your address.
We need to know where you live, so...

829
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:22,724
- No, no. No, no, no. Don't. Wait.
- [employee] Anything else?

830
00:50:22,748 --> 00:50:23,959
We need your address! Olivia.

831
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:26,022
- And a Snackin' Bacon…
- Olivia, your address, please.

832
00:50:26,046 --> 00:50:27,716
…and one cappuccino. That's it.

833
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,931
- [employee] Your total is...
- And as much ketchup as you can give us!

834
00:50:31,014 --> 00:50:33,770
The ketchup's for my friend.
Yes. How much?

835
00:50:33,853 --> 00:50:35,857
Uh, your total is $39.

- [Olivia groans]

838
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:10,426
[in English] Sleep.

839
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,180
Oh, oh! [Sighs]

840
00:51:12,263 --> 00:51:13,432
Okay, um…

841
00:51:13,516 --> 00:51:15,186
- Sleep time.
- Uh, wait.

842
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:16,355
Dress can come off.

843
00:51:17,148 --> 00:51:21,156
No, no, no, no! The-The dress stays on.
You sleep in your clothes.

844
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:24,287
- No, no. No. No, no.
- Take it off.

845
00:51:24,371 --> 00:51:25,531
[Antonio] No, no, no, no, no.

846

Oh, God.

862
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:44,317
Good morning.

863
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,402
Hello.

864
00:53:45,486 --> 00:53:47,991
I-I-I just want you to know
that nothing happened.

865
00:53:48,075 --> 00:53:52,041
I-I didn't even look.
And I slept in my pants. See?

866
00:53:52,668 --> 00:53:53,670
Okay.

867
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,970
Thanks for, um,
taking care of me last night.

868
00:53:58,846 --> 00:54:00,391
You would've done the same for me.

869
00:54:00,975 --> 00:54:05,735
Well, I doubt it, but, I mean, sure, okay.

870
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:09,868
What's your... What's your address
so I can tell my assistant?

871
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,708
It's 1122 Valencia.

872
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,793
Oh, South Valencia.

873
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,049
South Valencia. Because if you go
to North Valencia, it's a batting cage.

874
00:54:17,926 --> 00:54:19,930
And is there a coffee place near here?

875
00:54:20,807 --> 00:54:23,855
Oh, no. I-I can make you a cup of coffee.

876
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:25,650
Oh, thank you. Do you have almond milk?

877
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:26,652
No.

878
00:54:26,736 --> 00:54:28,363
Uh, okay.

879
00:54:28,447 --> 00:54:29,700
[Antonio] I do have aspirin.

880
00:54:29,783 --> 00:54:32,455
Oh! Yes. Yes. Yes.

881
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:34,752
All the aspirin in the world, please.

882
00:54:34,835 --> 00:54:38,926
And I'm gonna clean this face
because, well, it's obvious.

Sorry.

887
00:55:00,385 --> 00:55:03,559
[in English]
Sorry about this. I'm really sorry.

888
00:55:03,643 --> 00:55:05,062
This is Clara, my sister.

889
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:06,457
- Hi.
- [Antonio] And you know Benny.

890
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:08,694
And my nephews, Luca and Dante.

My landlord, Mr. Kim.

892

- Hi.
- [Olivia] Hi.

893
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,453
And, I'm assuming, his family?

894
00:55:13,538 --> 00:55:14,724
- Picture?
- I wasn't gonna ask,

895
00:55:14,748 --> 00:55:16,520
but if you're gonna do that,
I want a picture too.

896
00:55:16,544 --> 00:55:17,796
[stammers] Later.

897
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:20,677
My tía Christina. My tía Tere.
My tía Zenaida.

898
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,806
- Hi.
- And Chucho and his girlfriend.

899
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:24,368
- Oh, Chucho. Nice.
- And these people,

900
00:55:24,392 --> 00:55:25,895
I've never seen before in my life.

901
00:55:26,564 --> 00:55:28,604
It's such a pleasure
to meet all of you all at once.

902
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:29,921
[Clara] I'm gonna make you a plate.

903
00:55:29,945 --> 00:55:31,824
Oh, you know, I'm just heading off, and…

904
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:33,971
You're heading to this chair.
You're gonna eat with us.

905
00:55:33,995 --> 00:55:34,997
Here you go.

906
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:47,647
- [in English] Coffee?
- Thank you.

907
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:50,485
- La suegra's chilaquiles.
- [Olivia] Oh, wow!

908
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:53,993
Although I prefer a little to stones
on the side like we do in Puerto Rico.

909
00:55:54,076 --> 00:55:56,039
- But these are amazing.
- Uh... Uh, um…

910
00:55:56,122 --> 00:55:58,001
- Well, I-I don't know.
- [laughs]

911
00:55:58,084 --> 00:56:00,464
- Here you go.
- [Olivia] Oh, there's more.

912
00:56:00,548 --> 00:56:02,134
Is that enough huevo revuelto for you?

913
00:56:02,217 --> 00:56:03,721
That's enough for a whole month.

914
00:56:03,804 --> 00:56:05,850
[laughing]

915
00:56:05,934 --> 00:56:07,102
Wasn't joking. Okay.

916
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,233
Okay.

917
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:15,912
- Mm-hmm.
- [Benny] Eh?

918
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:18,124
- Yay! Gorgeous.
- Oh, my God!

919
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,087
- It's really good.
- She loves it!

920
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,422
Ooh! What's the occasion?

921
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:22,717
Oh, it... it's Sunday.

922
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:23,970
Oh! Huh.

923
00:56:24,805 --> 00:56:28,144
I don't spend that much time
with my family under one roof.

924
00:56:28,228 --> 00:56:30,650
Oh, not us. There's something in our DNA.

925
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,830
Kinda like having one of those
shock collars they use to train dogs.

926
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:36,285
You know, like,
we stray too far from home and then…

927
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:37,489
- [imitates shock]
- [laughs]

928
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,353
[in English] Let the woman breathe.

929
00:56:40,377 --> 00:56:41,379
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay.

930
00:56:41,462 --> 00:56:45,262
So, we're so excited about your movie.
We've been reading about it everywhere.

931
00:56:45,345 --> 00:56:48,059
Oh, wow. Well, please don't tell me
what you've read.

932
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:51,190
I don't really like reading reviews.
You know, it messes with my head.

933
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:52,401
Tell me about it, yeah.

934
00:56:52,484 --> 00:56:54,214
- I got a bad one on Yelp once.
- [Olivia] Oh, no.

935
00:56:54,238 --> 00:56:56,200
Still keeps me up at night.

936
00:56:56,284 --> 00:56:58,581
"Left the car smelling
like a Russian bowling league."

937
00:56:58,664 --> 00:57:00,417
[both] What's that even supposed to mean?

938
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,502
I don't know.

939
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:05,093
Um, but what I do know is that this
is very good, and I would like some more.

940
00:57:05,177 --> 00:57:07,473
[Clara] I'll get you right now. [Laughs]

941
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:08,559
No…

942
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,585
[knocking]

943
00:57:43,796 --> 00:57:45,550
- [Isabel, in English] Hey.
- Dad.

944
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:47,595
Thought I didn't have Marco
until next weekend.

945
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:50,768
- Yeah, he just forgot his math book again.
- [chattering]

946
00:57:50,852 --> 00:57:52,647
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Marco.

947
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,235
Hi. I'm Olivia. Nice to meet you.

948
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:58,158
Sorry. I-I-I didn't know you had company.

949
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,580
- Uh, no.
- Just tell Marco I'll be in the car.

950
00:58:00,663 --> 00:58:03,711
- [Marco] I've seen the trailers.
- [Olivia] Oh, thank you. So nice.

951
00:58:03,794 --> 00:58:04,796
Oh, really?

952
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,440
- [Marco] Yeah. I'm in the school play.
- [Olivia] Oh, wow. Okay.

953
00:58:10,558 --> 00:58:11,558
You okay?

954
00:58:16,068 --> 00:58:17,237
[knocking]

955
00:58:19,868 --> 00:58:20,870
[in English] Hi.

956
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:23,834
[door closes]

957
00:58:31,892 --> 00:58:34,438
- Was that your ex or something?
- Mmm.

958
00:58:35,691 --> 00:58:36,777
We're separated.

959
00:58:38,822 --> 00:58:42,872
I-I-I have been trying to get her back,
but now that she saw me with you,

960
00:58:42,956 --> 00:58:44,083
I ruined everything.

961
00:58:44,584 --> 00:58:45,836
She will never come back.

962
00:58:46,379 --> 00:58:47,381
[stammers]

963
00:58:48,383 --> 00:58:49,468
You don't know that.

964
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,848
I look like a playboy.

965
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:53,268
Well, who broke up with who?

966
00:58:53,852 --> 00:58:55,438
She broke up with me.

967
00:58:55,523 --> 00:58:58,486
Yeah, you definitely didn't ruin anything.

968
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,704
[phone vibrating, chimes]

969
00:59:04,331 --> 00:59:05,333
Isabel.

970
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,632
[groans]

971
00:59:09,884 --> 00:59:12,139
She needs me to sign some field-trip form.

972
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,105
I guarantee you
there's no "field-trip form."

973
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,282
[Isabel] Hey.

974
00:59:23,453 --> 00:59:25,791
I mean, I just...
I feel a little blindsided here.

975
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:28,797
I mean, I told you about Ronnie,
and that's not even that serious.

976
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:31,218
Uh, don't you need me to sign something?

977
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:32,302
No.

978
00:59:33,056 --> 00:59:36,270
I mean, I-I-I'm happy for you.
You're moving on.

979
00:59:36,354 --> 00:59:37,791
- [Antonio] No, no, but...
- Which is great.

980
00:59:37,815 --> 00:59:40,046
- It's not what you think.
- I guess I was the one that said

981
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:43,326
we should be dating other people,
so, you know, I'm glad that you're dating.

982
00:59:43,409 --> 00:59:44,829
No, no, but listen...

983
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,668
Do you love her? No, forget it.

984
00:59:48,587 --> 00:59:50,173
Look, hey, listen.

985
00:59:50,256 --> 00:59:52,344
- Are you going to the Oscars?
- [door opens]

986
00:59:54,431 --> 00:59:55,433
[clears throat]

987
00:59:58,982 --> 01:00:03,449
You know what? I don't need to know.
It's good.

988
01:00:03,534 --> 01:00:06,455
- Okay.
- Just, um, tell Marco to hurry up, okay?

989
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,501
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

990
01:00:10,881 --> 01:00:11,883
Are you okay?

991
01:00:12,426 --> 01:00:13,428
[Isabel] Great.

992
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:16,225
[footsteps departing]

993
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:18,772
- So we're doing A Midsummer Night's Dream.
- Oh, wow.

994
01:00:18,856 --> 01:00:22,195
Yeah. I think it'd be awesome
if you wanted to come. I'm Lysander.

995
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:24,074
One of the lovers. That's a great role.

996
01:00:24,158 --> 01:00:27,330
Hijo, she's not going
to a high school play of Shakespeare.

997
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:29,544
- Unabridged.
- No one asked you, cerdito.

998
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,231
[Benny] Thought she should have
the whole information.

999
01:00:31,255 --> 01:00:33,927
I mean, it's two and half hours,
not counting intermission.

1000
01:00:34,011 --> 01:00:36,283
- It's Shakespeare. It...
- It's long, is what it is, papi.

1001
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:37,953
Come on, your mom is waiting for you.
Come on.

1002
01:00:37,977 --> 01:00:39,731
Okay. All right. Bye, everybody.

1003
01:00:39,814 --> 01:00:42,003
And fingers crossed,
we both have big openings this weekend.

1004
01:00:42,027 --> 01:00:44,031
[speaking Spanish, chuckles]
Ay, qué lindo.

1005
01:00:44,114 --> 01:00:45,408
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, mijo.

1006
01:00:45,492 --> 01:00:48,182
- That's my assistant, I should probably...
- You know what that means? Leftover time.

1007
01:00:48,206 --> 01:00:51,086
- I need to make you a care package.
- Please, I've had more than enough.

1008
01:00:56,013 --> 01:00:57,534
- [Clara] Mmm.
- [Olivia, in English] Oh!

1009
01:00:57,558 --> 01:00:59,436
Heat the Mexican stuff
in the microwave, okay?

1010
01:00:59,521 --> 01:01:01,208
I don't know what to do
with the Korean stuff.

1011
01:01:01,232 --> 01:01:02,150
[footsteps departing]

1012
01:01:02,234 --> 01:01:05,616
One, two... Say "Kimchi!"

1013
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:07,285
[all] Kimchi!

1014
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:10,375
[Antonio] Okay. Okay, that's enough.
No, no, no, no. No. Enough.

1015
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,087
No, guys. No more. No more.

1016
01:01:16,888 --> 01:01:19,620
- Come on, guys. Now, let's go inside.
- Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thank you.

1017
01:01:19,644 --> 01:01:23,276
Sorry again. There's no word
for "boundaries" in Spanish.

1018
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,946
Or Korean, apparently.

1019
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:27,242
I liked it.
I don't see my family that much.

1020
01:01:27,325 --> 01:01:28,327
[groans]

1021
01:01:28,411 --> 01:01:29,914
- And you were right.
- What?

1022
01:01:30,415 --> 01:01:31,543
Isabel is jealous.

1023
01:01:32,419 --> 01:01:35,091
Maybe we'll both get what we want
out of this insanity.

1024
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:38,389
Sorry. Waze took me to some batting cage.

1025
01:01:38,472 --> 01:01:39,474
[Olivia] Okay.

1026
01:01:42,272 --> 01:01:43,592
- All right, well…
- [door closes]

1027
01:01:44,902 --> 01:01:47,282
…I guess this is, uh, goodbye. [Chuckles]

1028
01:01:47,365 --> 01:01:49,787
Thank you.
Thank you so much for helping me out.

1029
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:53,169
Yeah, I'm looking at 'em right now, ma'am.
They're a couple.

1030
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:56,926
She really spent the night in the barrio?

1031
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:00,643
[Stegman] I don't think we use that
word anymore, but yeah, they shacked up.

1032
01:02:00,726 --> 01:02:03,272
I can't believe that bastard
was actually telling the truth.

1033
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:06,863
[Stegman] Well, it happens sometimes.
Not always, but sometimes.

1034
01:02:06,946 --> 01:02:08,491
- [chuckles]
- I'll send an invoice.

1035
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:19,889
Couldn't sleep last night,

1036
01:02:19,972 --> 01:02:22,477
so I poured myself a scotch
and did some soul-searching.

1037
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:25,567
And I asked myself,
"What kind of man do I wanna be?"

1038
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:28,907
And I realized
the answer to that question is "rich."

1039
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,744
I want to be a rich and powerful man.

1040
01:02:31,453 --> 01:02:33,667
- I admire your honesty.
- And what was I thinking,

1041
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,798
juggling two women at a premiere
like I'm Leonardo DiCaprio?

1042
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:39,177
You know, when I was in business school,
I had one dream,

1043
01:02:39,261 --> 01:02:43,018
and that was to become the CEO
of a vast real estate empire.

1044
01:02:43,102 --> 01:02:46,150
Now, why would I risk all that
for what might likely be a passing fancy?

1045
01:02:46,233 --> 01:02:48,822
I mean, sure, Olivia's intoxicating now,

1046
01:02:48,905 --> 01:02:51,243
but who knows
how I'll feel in a few months?

1047
01:02:51,326 --> 01:02:53,205
Besides, I adore my wife.

1048
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:55,627
I mean, why wouldn't I?
She's the whole package.

1049
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:57,088
[phone ringing]

1050
01:02:57,172 --> 01:02:58,174
It's Kapoor.

1051
01:02:58,717 --> 01:02:59,927
[phone beeps]

1052
01:03:00,011 --> 01:03:01,472
[Kapoor] Hello. Hello, guys?

1053
01:03:01,556 --> 01:03:03,058
Kapoor, what do you got?

1054
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:05,396
- Stegman is officially out of work.
- [chuckles]

1055
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,651
Okay, spectacular!

1056
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:09,446
Kathryn called the dogs off.

1057
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:13,370
Congratulations. You got away scot-free.

1058
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:17,713
Out of curiosity, um…

1059
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:19,550
What was the turning point?

1060
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:22,305
[Kapoor] Well, I hate to tell you, boss,
but she spent the night.

1061
01:03:22,807 --> 01:03:23,850
I see, uh…

1062
01:03:27,357 --> 01:03:28,400
She slept with him.

1063
01:03:30,572 --> 01:03:35,707
Vincent, the important thing is that your
empire and your marriage are still intact.

1064
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:37,043
No one asked you.

1065
01:03:37,628 --> 01:03:38,839
Kapoor, listen to me.

1066
01:03:38,922 --> 01:03:39,924
Hire another detective.

1067
01:03:40,007 --> 01:03:41,529
I want someone
following her day and night.

1068
01:03:41,553 --> 01:03:43,233
I want someone following him
day and night.

1069
01:03:43,264 --> 01:03:44,767
Full saturation coverage.

1070
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:47,690
[meditation music playing on stereo]

1071
01:03:47,773 --> 01:03:51,154
[instructor]
…to relax you further and further.

1072
01:03:52,115 --> 01:03:57,458
Let your shoulders drop. Relax your arms.

1073
01:03:58,587 --> 01:04:01,801
Feel your body begin to relax

1074
01:04:02,636 --> 01:04:06,519
as you envision yourself letting go.

1075
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:08,272
This is depressing.

1076
01:04:09,482 --> 01:04:11,236
I heard you might be looking for a job.

1077
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:15,036
- Son of a bitch. You had me bugged.
- [chuckles]

1078
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,789
Yeah, I'm good at what I do.

1079
01:04:16,873 --> 01:04:18,125

- Wow.
- The world's most expensive hat trick.

1229
01:13:31,982 --> 01:13:33,067
I'll bet, man.

1230
01:13:34,403 --> 01:13:36,300
Right now,
I'm staying out of my brother's place.

1231
01:13:36,324 --> 01:13:37,660
You got your own room?

1232
01:13:37,744 --> 01:13:42,377
No. He's going through a divorce too.
But his seven-year-old's got a trundle.

1233
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:45,008
So you sleep
in a seven-year-old's trundle?

1234
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:47,095
It's not terrible.

1235
01:13:48,348 --> 01:13:49,684
It is for the seven-year-old.

1236
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,314
- [hip hop playing on speakers]
- [cheering]

1237
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:02,627
[Isabel] Okay.

1238
01:14:03,545 --> 01:14:05,423
- [moaning]
- [sighs]

1239
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:06,510
What about Ronnie?

1240
01:14:06,593 --> 01:14:07,678
Ronnie's an idiot.

1241
01:14:07,762 --> 01:14:09,724
[moaning]

1242
01:14:09,808 --> 01:14:11,561
How serious are you and Olivia?

1243
01:14:11,645 --> 01:14:14,483
- Do I stand a chance?
- Yes. Yes, very much.

1244
01:14:14,567 --> 01:14:16,822
[moaning]

1245
01:14:16,905 --> 01:14:19,744
Really? I mean,
you would leave a famous actress for me?

1246
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:23,877
I'm not supposed to tell anyone,
but… we're not really dating.

1247
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:25,756
Wait. What?

1248
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,593
Yes, it's all pretend.

1249
01:14:27,677 --> 01:14:29,764
Olivia's having an affair
with some billionaire.

1250
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:31,852
Wait, wait, so you're not a couple?

1251
01:14:32,895 --> 01:14:36,611
No. No, I mean, the whole thing's made up,
so no one finds out.

1252
01:14:36,695 --> 01:14:38,156
You were never a couple?

1253
01:14:38,824 --> 01:14:41,788
No. The guy's lawyer shows up
and offers me money.

1254
01:14:41,872 --> 01:14:44,376
And then,
the guy's wife offers me even more money.

1255
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,005
What... How much money?

1256
01:14:46,088 --> 01:14:48,342
- $100,000.
- Wait, you got $100,000?

1257
01:14:48,426 --> 01:14:51,182
No, no, no, no.
I already gave my word to the other guy.

1258
01:14:51,265 --> 01:14:52,810
- But.
- But here's the best part.

1259
01:14:52,894 --> 01:14:54,614
- [Ronnie] Isabel!
- I was gonna surprise...

1260
01:14:55,356 --> 01:14:56,358
Isabel!

1261
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:57,862
Shit. That's Ronnie.

1262
01:14:57,945 --> 01:14:59,532
I gotta go. I'll call you later. Okay.

1263
01:14:59,616 --> 01:15:02,037
- Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1264
01:15:06,546 --> 01:15:09,176
[performer singing in Spanish]

1265
01:15:09,259 --> 01:15:11,013
[speaking Spanish]
Venga, cuñado, siéntate.

1266
01:15:15,063 --> 01:15:16,751
[in English]
Hey, I'm gonna walk Sofia home.

1267
01:15:16,775 --> 01:15:17,860
Mom knows.

1268
01:15:19,697 --> 01:15:21,033
Don't... Don't be weird.

1269
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:29,926
[in English] Check out the old folks.

1270
01:15:30,009 --> 01:15:32,574
I can't remember the last time
I danced with your sister like that.

1271
01:15:32,598 --> 01:15:34,101
Your cousin's wedding, 2004.

1272
01:15:34,184 --> 01:15:35,904
- Under duress.
- [speaking Spanish] Ay, ya.

1273
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:39,444
So listen,

1274
01:15:40,321 --> 01:15:43,327
I'm putting in a bid to take over
the parking at Vine Street Grill.

1275
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:46,543
How many restaurants is that? Four?

1276
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:47,628
Yeah.

1277
01:15:47,712 --> 01:15:49,632
Mmm. What a big shot.

1278
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:52,178
[chuckles] Not breaking out
the good scotch just yet.

1279
01:15:52,262 --> 01:15:54,349
Still haggling over some garage fees.

1280
01:15:54,433 --> 01:15:56,103
But if it works out, um…

1281
01:15:57,732 --> 01:15:59,736
I thought you could be
my guy on the ground.

1282
01:16:00,571 --> 01:16:02,407
Create some kind of management position.

1283
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:04,244
You want to promote me?

1284
01:16:05,163 --> 01:16:08,294
Hey. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

1285
01:16:08,377 --> 01:16:10,841
I should probably get going.
Do you mind walking me to my car?

1286
01:16:10,924 --> 01:16:13,137
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's go.

1287
01:16:15,058 --> 01:16:17,062
- [chattering]
- [laughing]

1288
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:19,483
Okay. All right.

1289
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:22,740
I'm really getting sick of these guys.

1290
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,661
Wanna mess with these guys?

1291
01:16:25,621 --> 01:16:28,167
Yes. Yes, I really do.

1292
01:16:29,086 --> 01:16:30,213
Come on. Hop on.

1293
01:16:31,382 --> 01:16:33,260
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, we're up. Hey, we're up!

1294
01:16:33,344 --> 01:16:35,306
- We're up!
- Let's go. Let's go get 'em.

1295
01:16:44,617 --> 01:16:45,702
[tires squealing]

1296
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,713
[Kapoor] Stay close. Hey. Stay close.

1297
01:16:50,796 --> 01:16:53,718
Stay close. Wait. Not too close.
Not too close. Not too close.

1298
01:16:53,802 --> 01:16:56,558
- Okay, now. Turn and wave.
- Okay.

1299
01:16:56,641 --> 01:16:58,227
[Kapoor] Get closer. Get closer.

1300
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,187
- Hold on!
- Okay.

1301
01:16:59,271 --> 01:17:00,440
[Kapoor] Cut it. Cut it.

1302
01:17:00,524 --> 01:17:01,818
[tires screeching]

1303
01:17:02,653 --> 01:17:04,197
[speaking Spanish] Vete a la fregada.

1304
01:17:04,281 --> 01:17:05,510
[Kapoor] Here you go. Cut it good.

1305
01:17:05,534 --> 01:17:07,430
Okay, wait.
Go the other way and cut it this way.

1306
01:17:07,454 --> 01:17:09,332
Now cut it... Now cut it left.

1307
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,838
Here you go. Cut it left.
No, you wanna cut it left.

1308
01:17:11,921 --> 01:17:14,217
When you're backing up,
you wanna cut it the other way.

1309
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:15,428
What does that mean?

1310
01:17:15,512 --> 01:17:18,852
- Just a fancy way to say, "Screw you."
- [Olivia] ¡Vete a la fregada!

1311
01:17:20,438 --> 01:17:21,758
[Kapoor, in English] Hey, cut it.

1312
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,785
You know, I've lived in Los Angeles
since I was 16,

1313
01:17:26,868 --> 01:17:28,705
and I've never been here.

1314
01:17:29,749 --> 01:17:30,834
It's beautiful.

1315
01:17:30,918 --> 01:17:32,420
Yeah. Yeah.

1316
01:17:33,339 --> 01:17:36,178
Just don't go
on the other side of the lake.

1317
01:17:36,261 --> 01:17:37,640
That's where the junkies are.

1318
01:17:41,396 --> 01:17:42,398
Cool.

1319
01:17:43,985 --> 01:17:45,404
No one recognizes me here.

1320
01:17:45,989 --> 01:17:47,576
[speaking Spanish] No, pues...

1321
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:50,666
[in English] No one expects to see
a famous actress in MacArthur Park.

1322
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:52,962
You got the night off.

1323
01:17:54,674 --> 01:17:56,260
It's kind of nice being invisible.

1324
01:17:58,807 --> 01:17:59,807
Huh.

1325
01:18:02,606 --> 01:18:03,668
- [Antonio] Guess what?
- What?

1326
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:04,986
Isabel wants me back.

1327
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,119
I'm not gonna say I told you so.

1328
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:10,956
But…

1329
01:18:11,749 --> 01:18:12,751
I told you…

1330
01:18:13,753 --> 01:18:15,214
- So.
- [chuckles]

1331
01:18:16,216 --> 01:18:17,678
[Olivia] I like this neighborhood.

1332
01:18:17,761 --> 01:18:20,016
- [Antonio] Yeah. It's great, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1333
01:18:21,018 --> 01:18:22,312
But it's gonna change.

1334
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:25,819
Some developer bought, like, three blocks.

1335
01:18:26,529 --> 01:18:29,284
Pretty soon,
no one's gonna be able to afford the rent.

1336
01:18:29,367 --> 01:18:30,411
[Olivia] Hmm.

1337
01:18:30,996 --> 01:18:33,710
Clara was only nine,
and I had to help out, so…

1338
01:18:34,545 --> 01:18:38,929
You know, I started bus sing tables
and working construction.

1339
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:41,391
- Those guys you see outside Home Depot?
- Yeah.

1340
01:18:41,475 --> 01:18:42,811
That was me. [Chuckles]

1341
01:18:43,938 --> 01:18:45,859
Feel like I should've paid for the pizza.

1342
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,613
[scoffs, chuckles]

1343
01:18:48,782 --> 01:18:52,539
When... When I finally got a steady job
as a valet…

1344
01:18:54,459 --> 01:18:56,129
I thought I was doing pretty good.

1345
01:18:56,756 --> 01:18:59,094
And I was saving to help Clara
go to college.

1346
01:19:00,304 --> 01:19:01,766
She's a school principal now.

1347
01:19:03,477 --> 01:19:04,772
She must be so grateful.

1348
01:19:05,649 --> 01:19:08,571
Well, if she is… [chuckles]
…she keeps it to herself.

1349
01:19:08,655 --> 01:19:09,740
[chuckles]

1350
01:19:10,617 --> 01:19:11,869
Oh, this is you, right?

1351
01:19:12,579 --> 01:19:14,750
Yep, that's me.

1352
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:16,378
Yeah.

1353
01:19:17,088 --> 01:19:18,090
[Olivia] Um…

1354
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:20,804
You know, I, um…

1355
01:19:21,889 --> 01:19:23,810
I don't really feel
like being alone tonight.

1356
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:25,856
Is it okay if I stay at your apartment?

1357
01:19:27,442 --> 01:19:29,530
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

1358
01:19:31,116 --> 01:19:33,328
Thank you. Cool.

1359
01:19:34,122 --> 01:19:35,584
But you get the chair this time.

1360
01:19:35,667 --> 01:19:37,671
Yeah. That's... That's fair.

1361
01:19:37,755 --> 01:19:38,757
Yeah.

1362
01:19:40,426 --> 01:19:42,806
[scoffs] You know
I'm gonna insist you take the bed.

1363
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,518
I was really counting on it.

1364
01:19:44,602 --> 01:19:45,604
[chuckles]

1365
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:47,440
No, seriously. You take the chair.

1366
01:19:52,743 --> 01:19:55,540
[performer singing in Spanish on radio]

1367

[door opens]

1368
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,305
[speaking Spanish] ¡Amá!

1369
01:20:28,438 --> 01:20:29,692
[sighs]

[sighs]

1371
01:20:36,371 --> 01:20:38,626
- [Olivia, in English] Hi, Mrs. Flores.
- Amá.

1372
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,421
- [grunts]
- [sighs]

1373
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,157
The detectives are watching us
from that apartment.

1374
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:47,143
What? [Grunts] Damn it.

1375
01:20:47,226 --> 01:20:48,980
I'll close them in the bedroom too.

1376
01:20:49,815 --> 01:20:52,320
No. You know what?

1377
01:20:53,113 --> 01:20:54,490
[Antonio] What?

1378
01:20:54,575 --> 01:20:59,417
If Vincent wants to know what's going on…
[chuckles] …in the bedroom,

1379
01:21:00,629 --> 01:21:04,177
we're gonna show him
what's going on in the bedroom.

1380
01:21:06,056 --> 01:21:07,475
What's going on in the bedroom?

1381
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:13,613
[Stegman] Okay, what I don't understand is
who put the spell on Lysander.

1382
01:21:13,696 --> 01:21:15,491
[Kapoor] Puck did. But it doesn't matter.

1383
01:21:15,575 --> 01:21:19,374
I think what Shakespeare's trying to say
is we can't help ourselves.

1384
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:22,839
We fall in love with the wrong people.

1385
01:21:22,923 --> 01:21:24,092
- Oh, boy.
- What?

1386
01:21:24,175 --> 01:21:26,806
- [Kapoor] Client ain't gonna like this.
- Put it on.

1387
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,601
- [Kapoor] Oh, wow.
- Okay.

1388
01:21:28,685 --> 01:21:29,687
[Kapoor] Here we go.

1389
01:21:30,772 --> 01:21:32,567
- Perfect.
- [Stegman] Wow.

1390
01:21:32,651 --> 01:21:33,485
[Kapoor] Oh, wow.

1391
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:38,036
[Stegman] I would say that's...
That's evidence right there, isn't it?

1392
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,459
- Okay. You okay? Okay.
- Yeah.

1393
01:21:41,544 --> 01:21:44,424
That's my shoe. It's okay.
Now I'm gonna push you. Okay.

1394
01:21:44,925 --> 01:21:49,350
Okay. All right.
Now I'm gonna sensually climb you.

1395
01:21:50,436 --> 01:21:51,438
[Stegman] Wow.

1396
01:21:51,522 --> 01:21:54,402
[laughing] She is wild.

1397
01:21:54,485 --> 01:21:57,701
And now we writhe. And now we writhe.
And now...

1398
01:21:57,784 --> 01:21:59,621
Oh, yeah, we're gonna get in the hair now.

1399
01:21:59,705 --> 01:22:03,420
Gonna get in the hair. Oh, we're surfing.
We're surfing some waves.

1400
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:07,888
- There's some waves of ecstasy. Oh, yeah.
- I'm starting to feel uncomfortable.

1401
01:22:07,971 --> 01:22:09,057
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1402
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,769
Okay. I don't really need you anymore.

1403
01:22:10,852 --> 01:22:13,566
You can just... You can just slip out.
You're under the frame.

1404
01:22:13,649 --> 01:22:15,588
- I can leave?
- Yeah, just stay under the windowsill.

1405
01:22:15,612 --> 01:22:17,699
- Just slither down.
- Okay.

1406
01:22:17,783 --> 01:22:19,383
[Olivia] Just stay under the windowsill.

1407
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:22,793
Oh, no. The one-woman show. Ooh, kinky.

1408
01:22:22,876 --> 01:22:24,797
[Stegman sighs] What a lucky guy.

1409
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,926
God, she's doing all the work.

1410
01:22:27,009 --> 01:22:29,515
Antonio! Oh, Antonio!

1411
01:22:29,598 --> 01:22:30,642
[whispering] What?

1412
01:22:30,725 --> 01:22:32,144
I'm acting.

1413
01:22:32,228 --> 01:22:33,355
[grunts]

1414
01:22:33,438 --> 01:22:36,319
[Olivia] Okay. Okay.
I'm a gazelle. I'm a little gazelle.

1415
01:22:36,904 --> 01:22:38,741
What does this guy have that I don't have?

1416
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:40,452
Her.

1417
01:22:41,287 --> 01:22:43,291
[Olivia moans, screaming]

1418
01:22:47,592 --> 01:22:48,886
[Olivia] You're the man!

1419
01:22:48,928 --> 01:22:50,430
Oh, yes, yes!

1420
01:22:57,027 --> 01:22:59,783
[Olivia screams, in English]
That is how you have sex with someone!

1421
01:23:11,515 --> 01:23:13,769
- [Olivia, in English] You know what to do.
- [moans]

1422
01:23:13,853 --> 01:23:15,857
- ¡Amá!
- [Olivia] Oh, Antonio!

1423
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,529
Oh, yeah, this is the best by far!

1424
01:23:23,789 --> 01:23:26,795
[Olivia moans, in English]
That's it! That's it! Ay, papi!

1425
01:23:29,593 --> 01:23:32,557
I still don't really
understand why are you two doing all this.

1426
01:23:34,101 --> 01:23:35,522
A lot of reasons.

1427
01:23:37,776 --> 01:23:40,531
I can't think of them right now, but…

1428
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:44,957
There were some. [Chuckles]

1429
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:50,467
Are you okay?

1430
01:23:53,558 --> 01:23:56,312
I don't want you to think,
you know, I'm some…

1431
01:23:57,481 --> 01:23:59,695
Ungrateful, poor little movie star.

1432
01:24:02,993 --> 01:24:04,245
I don't think that.

1433
01:24:08,587 --> 01:24:11,760
I have one of the most recognizable faces
in the world.

1434
01:24:14,307 --> 01:24:15,727
I don't ever really feel…

1435
01:24:17,438 --> 01:24:18,524
Seen.

1436
01:24:21,655 --> 01:24:24,201
I've convinced myself
I have this perfect life

1437
01:24:24,285 --> 01:24:25,580
that everyone thinks I have,

1438
01:24:25,663 --> 01:24:29,963
but I have never had
a healthy long-term relationship.

1439
01:24:32,969 --> 01:24:34,806
All my friends are people I pay.

1440
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:37,729
I don't see my family ever.

1441
01:24:41,361 --> 01:24:43,365
I had Thanksgiving with my assistant.

1442
01:24:43,448 --> 01:24:44,450
[chuckles]

1443
01:24:45,202 --> 01:24:46,204
[sighs]

1444
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,420
And Vince is never gonna leave his wife.

1445
01:24:52,592 --> 01:24:54,888
He would be crazy not to.

1446
01:24:59,606 --> 01:25:00,608
You're a good guy.

1447
01:25:01,442 --> 01:25:03,656
Why can't I fall in love
with someone like you?

1448
01:25:05,117 --> 01:25:06,119
I'm taken.

1449
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:07,914
Yeah, that's my type.

1450
01:25:07,997 --> 01:25:10,001
[chuckles]

1451
01:25:12,381 --> 01:25:13,718
Hey, where are you going? Stay.

1452
01:25:17,182 --> 01:25:18,476
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1453
01:25:19,855 --> 01:25:20,857
Okay.

1454
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:22,401
Here.

1455
01:25:32,129 --> 01:25:33,883
You wanna hear something funny?

1456
01:25:36,095 --> 01:25:37,891
- Yeah.
- It's really embarrassing.

1457
01:25:41,147 --> 01:25:43,819
My real name isn't Olivia Allan.

1458
01:25:46,992 --> 01:25:48,495
It's Betsy Shevchuk.

1459
01:25:52,044 --> 01:25:54,423
That's a terrible name.

1460
01:25:55,425 --> 01:25:56,762
It's good you changed it.

1461
01:25:56,845 --> 01:25:57,931
[chuckles]

1462
01:26:03,526 --> 01:26:04,945
I just made us 300 bucks.

1463
01:26:05,613 --> 01:26:06,865
Tipped off the paparazzi.

1464
01:26:06,949 --> 01:26:10,038
Ethically questionable,
but tonight we're gonna eat like kings.

1465
01:26:10,121 --> 01:26:12,459
Dude, I was gone for 20 minutes. I…

1466
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:15,006
[phone chimes, vibrating]

1467
01:26:29,995 --> 01:26:31,205
Where are you going?

1468
01:26:32,374 --> 01:26:34,588
I'm meeting Isabel. Go back to sleep.

1469
01:26:35,923 --> 01:26:37,384
There's coffee above the fridge.

1470
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,751
Couldn't sleep last night.

1471
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:54,834
[chuckles]

1472
01:26:54,878 --> 01:26:56,172
Me either.

1473
01:26:56,255 --> 01:26:58,719
I was, you know, thinking and thinking.

1474
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:00,931
Uh…

1475
01:27:03,896 --> 01:27:06,150
Look, this isn't easy for me, but, um…

1476
01:27:09,073 --> 01:27:10,241
I thought about it.

1477
01:27:11,954 --> 01:27:13,958
And I thought about it, and…

1478
01:27:16,087 --> 01:27:18,257
This is never gonna be what I need.

1479
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,142
What are you saying?

1480
01:27:24,562 --> 01:27:26,399
We met when we were really young.

1481
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:29,739
We're different people now.

1482
01:27:31,827 --> 01:27:33,914
I think it's time we got the divorce.

1483
01:27:33,998 --> 01:27:34,999
[gasps]

1484
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,968
- But you kissed me last night.
- I know.

1485
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:43,726
But then I couldn't stop thinking about
all the money that you turned down.

1486
01:27:45,353 --> 01:27:49,319
Antonio, you walk through life
like you don't deserve much.

1487
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:52,075
How do you think that makes me feel?

1488
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:57,670
I wanna be with someone who feels like
they deserve the best of everything.

1489
01:27:59,924 --> 01:28:01,010
I'm sorry.

1490
01:28:05,018 --> 01:28:06,563
Yeah. A work of art.

1491
01:28:07,732 --> 01:28:10,529
It's a work of art. Truly. Bravo.

1492
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,449
It's excellent work.

1493
01:28:12,533 --> 01:28:14,621
And it is just what Pico-Union needs.

1494
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,209
Incredible. Thank you.

1495
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,754
- [phone vibrating]
- Ooh, uh…

1496
01:28:18,837 --> 01:28:19,839
Excuse me.

1497
01:28:23,471 --> 01:28:24,891
[sighs]

1498
01:28:24,974 --> 01:28:26,143
Is that Kapoor?

1499
01:28:27,772 --> 01:28:30,861
- It's nothing you need to worry about.
- Please don't treat me like a child.

1500
01:28:33,407 --> 01:28:35,078
[Kapoor] God, she's doing all the work.

1501
01:28:35,579 --> 01:28:36,623
I see.

1502
01:28:37,499 --> 01:28:38,585
Good to know.

1503
01:28:38,669 --> 01:28:39,796
[Kapoor] This is a woman.

1504
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:43,052
[dubbing actor speaking Spanish on TV]

1505
01:28:46,225 --> 01:28:48,312
[in English]
I think I'm more attractive in Spanish.

1506
01:28:49,481 --> 01:28:51,193
Hey, how'd it go?

1507
01:28:51,778 --> 01:28:52,864
Not great.

1508
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:04,428
What happened?

1509
01:29:05,388 --> 01:29:06,641
Isabel wants a divorce.

1510
01:29:09,104 --> 01:29:10,983
Wha... Why?

1511
01:29:11,066 --> 01:29:12,068
[Cecilia laughs]

1512
01:29:12,152 --> 01:29:14,239
She was only interested
because I was with you.

1513
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:18,957
When she found out I wasn't,
it was, "Adios, Antonio."

1514
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:21,588
- [actor continues speaking Spanish]
- [Cecilia laughs]

1515
01:29:21,671 --> 01:29:23,007
Um, I'm sorry.

1516
01:29:24,176 --> 01:29:26,096
Yeah. Me too.

1517
01:29:26,765 --> 01:29:28,434
Did she give you any other reason?

1518
01:29:29,269 --> 01:29:31,023
She doesn't want to be with a valet.

1519
01:29:32,526 --> 01:29:34,948
She has bigger plans than me.

1520
01:29:35,031 --> 01:29:36,075
Wha... She said that?

1521
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:38,664
She's been saying that
for years in a certain way.

1522
01:29:40,918 --> 01:29:42,588
Well, maybe she doesn't deserve you.

1523
01:29:44,007 --> 01:29:46,345
I take ketchup packets from restaurants.

1524
01:29:46,387 --> 01:29:47,848
Yeah, I'm a real catch.

1525
01:29:48,725 --> 01:29:52,900
- I have a drawer full of soy sauce.
- I don't wanna talk about her, okay?

1526
01:29:52,984 --> 01:29:55,739
- Why don't you wanna talk? Let's talk.
- Because I don't, okay?

1527
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:56,903
But you're a wonderful man.

1528
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:58,870
You should be with someone
who appreciates you.

1529
01:29:59,454 --> 01:30:01,291
How can you say that with a straight face?

1530
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:03,714
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

1531
01:30:03,797 --> 01:30:06,135
No, come on.
You put it out there. What does that mean?

1532
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:11,646
You can have any man in the world,
and you pick one that is married. Great.

1533
01:30:13,315 --> 01:30:15,821
That's not fair. I didn't know
he was married when I met him.

1534
01:30:15,904 --> 01:30:19,327
Did you ever think that maybe...
Maybe you don't want a relationship?

1535
01:30:19,411 --> 01:30:21,958
Maybe you don't want anyone
to really know you.

1536
01:30:22,877 --> 01:30:26,133
- Okay, that's ridiculous.
- You don't even talk to your own mother.

1537
01:30:26,216 --> 01:30:29,347
I share a bathroom with mine.
And she's not shy.

1538
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:30,893
Bye, Ma.

1539
01:30:30,976 --> 01:30:32,831
How did this become about me?
This was about you...

1540
01:30:32,855 --> 01:30:34,399
You don't know anything about me.

1541
01:30:34,483 --> 01:30:36,571
What are you talking about?
I'm your friend.

1542
01:30:36,654 --> 01:30:38,115
Oh, really? We're friends?

1543
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,078
- Of course.
- Come on.

1544
01:30:40,161 --> 01:30:41,998
You're gonna go back
to your movie-star life,

1545
01:30:42,082 --> 01:30:44,211
and I'm gonna go back
to being invisible to you.

1546
01:30:44,294 --> 01:30:46,131
That... That's not true.

1547
01:30:46,215 --> 01:30:50,098
[scoffs] And by the way,
being invisible is not fun.

1548
01:30:50,181 --> 01:30:53,939
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have people hand you their keys

1549
01:30:54,022 --> 01:30:55,776
and not even look you in the eye?

1550
01:30:56,653 --> 01:30:57,655
I'm not like that.

1551
01:30:57,738 --> 01:31:00,159
Oh! So you're gonna call me,
and we're gonna have lunch?

1552
01:31:01,663 --> 01:31:04,501
I don't know. Maybe.
I don't really do that with anyone.

1553
01:31:04,585 --> 01:31:06,189
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought.

1554
01:31:06,213 --> 01:31:08,844
You took what you needed from me,
and now you can leave.

1555
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:13,352
- [paparazzo] Olivia, Olivia! Smile!
- Look. Your real friends.

1556
01:31:13,435 --> 01:31:15,231
Last chance to take pictures, guys.

1557
01:31:15,314 --> 01:31:19,532
The actress and the valet,
we're breaking up. It's over.

1558
01:31:19,615 --> 01:31:21,118
- Antonio.
- What?

1559
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:24,625
Forget it.

1560
01:31:32,265 --> 01:31:33,744
[paparazzo 2]
Did you just end it with Antonio?

1561
01:31:33,768 --> 01:31:35,957
- [paparazzo 3] Quick chat!
- [paparazzo 2] Are you and Antonio over?

1562
01:31:35,981 --> 01:31:37,586
[paparazzo 4]
Is Antonio with somebody else?

1563
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:38,612
[shutters clicking]

1564
01:31:46,961 --> 01:31:48,047
[whispering] Perfecto.

1565
01:31:51,136 --> 01:31:53,224
[Daniel] Vincent.
Vincent, stay calm. Vincent.

1566
01:31:54,644 --> 01:31:55,646
Vincent! Vincent!

1567
01:31:55,729 --> 01:31:56,731
[grunts]

1568
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,319
Ow!

1569
01:31:59,402 --> 01:32:01,741
I didn't hire you
to sleep with my girlfriend!

1570
01:32:01,824 --> 01:32:04,246
That hurt!
Way more than I thought it would.

1571
01:32:04,329 --> 01:32:05,582
Let's go.

1572
01:32:05,666 --> 01:32:07,001
I'm not paying you a cent.

1573
01:32:08,003 --> 01:32:09,297
Get... All right, all right.

1574

[vehicle departing]

1577

[in English]
So, you never had sex with her?

1578
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:13,090
Nah.

1579
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:17,851
I hate seeing you hurt.

1580
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,801
- But the world makes sense again.
- [vehicle approaching]

1581
01:33:22,193 --> 01:33:23,953
- Mr. Flores?
- [Javier speaks Spanish] Paso.

1582
01:33:24,406 --> 01:33:25,408
[in English] Oh.

1583
01:33:25,491 --> 01:33:27,161
- Yes?
- Do you have a minute?

1584
01:33:31,503 --> 01:33:34,510
My employer can be a little volatile.

1585
01:33:35,762 --> 01:33:37,599
But you kept your side of the bargain.

1586
01:33:42,316 --> 01:33:44,070
$25,000?

1587
01:33:45,866 --> 01:33:48,538
But that... that's much more
than we agreed to.

1588
01:33:48,621 --> 01:33:49,665
He won't notice.

1589
01:33:50,876 --> 01:33:52,713
No, no, no. I can't accept this.

1590
01:34:00,019 --> 01:34:02,023
You know, I grew up not too far from you.

1591
01:34:04,068 --> 01:34:07,200
My father was the locker-room attendant
at the California Club.

1592
01:34:40,892 --> 01:34:43,230
[in English] In my job,
I don't get too many opportunities

1593
01:34:43,313 --> 01:34:44,567
to do the right thing.

1594
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:47,363
[Stegman] Hey, look at these two.

1595
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:52,624
They just had sex,
and now he's making her eggs.

1596
01:34:53,585 --> 01:34:57,425
I swear to God,
I never had a relationship that good.

1597
01:34:59,638 --> 01:35:00,724
Stegman, listen, um…

1598
01:35:01,559 --> 01:35:03,353
You know, I've got this extra room.

1599
01:35:03,437 --> 01:35:06,318
Two-bedroom place. It's on the jetty.

1600
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:09,115
And, you know, we could get you off
your Sponge Bob trundle.

1601
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:10,619
If that's something…

1602
01:35:10,702 --> 01:35:11,704
That an offer?

1603
01:35:11,787 --> 01:35:13,934
No, I'm just... You know, I could use
the company, you know?

1604
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:16,171
- And there's paddle tennis courts.
- Oh, yeah.

1605
01:35:16,254 --> 01:35:18,854
- I don't know what that is, but...
- Yeah, we could get in shape.

1606
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:20,346
Yeah, hold each other accountable.

1607
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:23,393
We could... Yeah. If you know, if you...

1608
01:35:23,477 --> 01:35:26,316
- Not that I don't... But if you wanna...
- Dude. Yeah.

1609
01:35:26,399 --> 01:35:28,362
- Yeah?
- Come on, yeah.

1610
01:35:30,867 --> 01:35:32,286
[Kapoor] Roomies. All right.

1611
01:35:35,627 --> 01:35:36,629
Oh, shit.

I'm going to speak in English

01:37:23,049 --> 01:37:25,513
because I want Mr. Kim
to understand everything.

1622
01:37:33,195 --> 01:37:36,451
[in English]
Cecilia Imelda Lopez, viuda de Flores,

1623
01:37:37,954 --> 01:37:40,417
was born in El Remolino, Zacatecas.

1624
01:37:41,002 --> 01:37:44,801
A village so small,
it didn't appear on any maps.

1625
01:37:46,137 --> 01:37:47,306
Mama was tough.

1626
01:37:48,433 --> 01:37:49,603
She had to be.

1627
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:53,861
When she was young, she lost her parents,

1628
01:37:53,945 --> 01:37:57,535
two uncles and a cousin,
all in one terrible day.

1629
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:05,092
If you grow up poor in my country,
you have to face a lot of hard times.

1630
01:38:06,094 --> 01:38:07,304
A lot of violence.

1631
01:38:07,388 --> 01:38:10,435
However, she always stayed positive.

1632
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:13,859
She had to start working in the fields
to support herself.

1633
01:38:14,443 --> 01:38:15,905
That's how she met my dad.

1634
01:38:16,532 --> 01:38:18,536
They had me by the time she was 18.

1635
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,915
She had to work the entire pregnancy.

1636
01:38:20,999 --> 01:38:22,001
Literally.

1637
01:38:22,669 --> 01:38:24,756
I was born under an avocado tree.

1638
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:28,597
But she was happy
because she got paid for the full day.

1639
01:38:28,681 --> 01:38:30,685
[all laughing]

1640
01:38:31,645 --> 01:38:35,862
Several years later,
right before my sister was born,

1641
01:38:35,945 --> 01:38:39,452
my dad tried to break up a fight
between some workers…

1642
01:38:41,372 --> 01:38:43,209
And he died from a knife wound.

1643
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:47,886
Mama had to start all over again.

1644
01:38:48,888 --> 01:38:52,520
Mama saved every penny she could
to send Clara and me to the States.

1645
01:38:53,981 --> 01:38:58,031
I found out later, she never ate lunch
at work to save that money.

1646
01:38:59,618 --> 01:39:04,085
When we could, we brought her here,
and that's how she met Mr. Kim.

1649

that you lied about it.

or what brought you to this country,

1652
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:24,876
but my mother sent us here
to have a better life.

1653
01:39:26,839 --> 01:39:29,468
Maybe it was so she could meet you
one day as well.

01:39:48,632 --> 01:39:51,680
that was going to get her picture
in a magazine.

1660
01:39:53,767 --> 01:39:54,769
But she lived…

1661
01:39:56,272 --> 01:39:58,109
She lived an extraordinary life.

1662
01:40:02,367 --> 01:40:03,871
She was a force of nature.

1663
01:40:04,998 --> 01:40:08,839
When... When she loved, she loved fully.

1664
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:14,433
When she hugged,
she squeezed the life out of you.

[sniffles]

1666

01:44:08,527 --> 01:44:10,405
- Yeah, I would love a coffee.
- Okay.

1690
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,164
If that's not too much, thank you.

1691
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:17,460
Sorry, one sec.

1692
01:44:17,545 --> 01:44:19,131
[chattering continues]

1693
01:44:22,638 --> 01:44:23,682
Good luck.

[chattering continues]

1696
01:44:33,242 --> 01:44:35,539
Amanda just told me about your mom.

1697
01:44:38,461 --> 01:44:39,630
I'm so sorry.

1698
01:44:43,972 --> 01:44:45,016
Can we talk?

1699
01:44:45,893 --> 01:44:47,897
- [crew chattering]
- [clicks tongue]

1700
01:44:55,579 --> 01:44:57,040
Uh, so, you gonna talk, or…

1701
01:44:57,123 --> 01:44:58,627
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

1702
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:03,595
Look, I'm probably the last person
you need advice from,

1703
01:45:03,678 --> 01:45:08,062
but I just couldn't watch you
wait your turn with that cabrón.

1704
01:45:09,147 --> 01:45:11,235
He will never see you
for who you really are.

1705
01:45:12,905 --> 01:45:15,619
Well, did you just come here
to insult me more?

1706
01:45:15,702 --> 01:45:19,042
- No, no, no, no. No. No, I...
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1707
01:45:21,004 --> 01:45:22,842
I'm going to break up with him.

1708
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,014
- Yeah.
- Really?

1709
01:45:26,098 --> 01:45:29,897
Yeah. It's been far, far too long.

1710
01:45:30,607 --> 01:45:32,485
I'm finally ready.

1711
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:35,491
You probably deserve
a little credit for that.

1712
01:45:37,997 --> 01:45:39,750
I should not have said those things.

1713
01:45:40,794 --> 01:45:43,215
I didn't mean it. I'm really sorry.

1714
01:45:46,388 --> 01:45:47,641
Well, they were true.

1715
01:45:49,019 --> 01:45:50,689
Yeah, they were. That's why it hurt.

1716
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,904
I'm... I'm sorry too.

1717
01:45:55,364 --> 01:45:56,784
- Sorry.
- [phone vibrating]

1718
01:45:58,872 --> 01:46:01,209
No. Vincent.

1719
01:46:02,796 --> 01:46:03,798
You know, I just...

1720
01:46:03,882 --> 01:46:05,928
- I wanna be in the right frame of mind…
- Yeah.

1721
01:46:06,011 --> 01:46:07,197
- …when I tell him.
- Of course.

1722
01:46:07,221 --> 01:46:08,558
You're a strong woman.

1723
01:46:09,267 --> 01:46:11,940
- You can do it, güera. You can do it.
- [chuckles]

1724
01:46:12,023 --> 01:46:14,654
I've tried breaking up with him before,

1725
01:46:14,737 --> 01:46:18,536
- and he always talks me out of it.
- [production assistant] Ms. Allan.

1726
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:20,289
- We're ready for you.
- Okay.

1727
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,878
- I gotta go.
- Yeah, yeah.

1728
01:46:22,962 --> 01:46:24,507
- Okay.
- Go, go. Go ahead.

If you get weak, just call me, okay?

1731
01:46:30,644 --> 01:46:32,397
I'll remind you what an asshole he is.

1732
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:45,047
[Kathryn] Hi.
Why aren't you at the office?

1733
01:46:45,841 --> 01:46:47,010
Just playing a little hooky.

1734
01:46:47,093 --> 01:46:48,864
Why don't you go
get your suit on and join me?

1735
01:46:48,888 --> 01:46:49,890
All right.

1736
01:46:51,059 --> 01:46:54,024
Your daiquiri's at low tide.
I'll be right back.

Hi, Vince.

1743
01:48:07,253 --> 01:48:08,798
God, I've missed that hoodie.

1744

[screams]

01:48:18,735 --> 01:48:20,614
- Hey.
- Hi, Vincent.

1746
01:48:20,697 --> 01:48:22,158
It's me. The valet.

1747
01:48:23,243 --> 01:48:24,245
What is going on here?

1748
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:26,249
I'm serving you divorce papers.

1749
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:27,878
No, no, no. I'm calling security.

1750
01:48:27,961 --> 01:48:29,798
No, no, wait, wait, wait. Pérate.

1751
01:48:30,299 --> 01:48:33,472
Before you do that,
someone wants to talk with you.

1752
01:48:38,983 --> 01:48:40,361
- Hello?
- [Kathryn] Hi, honey.

1753
01:48:40,444 --> 01:48:43,450
Listen, I'm downstairs.
Listening to everything.

1754
01:48:43,534 --> 01:48:44,954
Okay. Okay.

1755
01:48:45,037 --> 01:48:50,464
Well then, Kathryn, listen to me
when I tell you that love conquers all,

1756
01:48:50,549 --> 01:48:51,968
and it always will.

1757
01:48:52,051 --> 01:48:53,638
And we will work through this.

1758
01:48:53,721 --> 01:48:54,890
[Kathryn] Oh, please.

1759
01:48:54,974 --> 01:48:56,519
Also, I'm taking the company.

1760
01:48:56,602 --> 01:49:01,111
[chuckles] Okay.
You can't take the company.

1761
01:49:01,194 --> 01:49:03,533
Uh, I built this empire
from the ground up.

1762
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:07,373
No, my father built it.
You just slapped your name on everything.

1763
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:10,254
Oh, and you're probably gonna
wanna go ahead and call your lawyer

1764
01:49:10,337 --> 01:49:12,008
because I did a little digging,

1765
01:49:12,091 --> 01:49:15,598
and I discovered some of
your very clever offshore holdings.

1766
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:17,143
As a member of the board,

1767
01:49:17,226 --> 01:49:20,316
I had a fiduciary responsibility
to inform the authorities.

1768
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:22,946
I hope that doesn't inconvenience you.

1769
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:26,662
Okay, Kathryn, um,
you've got this all wrong.

1770
01:49:26,746 --> 01:49:29,125
Olivia, she means nothing to me.

1771
01:49:29,208 --> 01:49:32,131
She's just some insecure,
vain actress that I wish...

1772
01:49:32,214 --> 01:49:34,135
That I wish that I had never met.

1773
01:49:34,218 --> 01:49:35,847
Yeah, you're on speaker, Vincent.

1774
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,686
Olivia, my love. Hello.

1775
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:41,066
Well, I finally did it. I finally did it.

1776
01:49:41,149 --> 01:49:43,153
We are... We are free.

1777
01:49:43,236 --> 01:49:46,076
And we can be together forever now.
No strings attached.

1778
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:50,752
Love always finds its way, and we will
work through this. Just you and me.

[in English] That felt good!

What... Are you speaking Spanish now?

1781

What? He brainwash you?

1782
01:50:02,274 --> 01:50:03,318
Hey!

1783
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:05,406
Adiós, Vicente.

1784
01:50:06,074 --> 01:50:07,076
What?

1785
01:50:08,621 --> 01:50:09,623
[door closes]

1786
01:50:11,585 --> 01:50:13,088
[Vincent] Shit!

1787
01:50:13,171 --> 01:50:17,096
I can't say how sorry I am
for getting involved with…

1788
01:50:18,432 --> 01:50:19,434
Him.

1789
01:50:21,312 --> 01:50:22,314
I feel terrible.

1790
01:50:22,398 --> 01:50:28,828
Listen, Vincent was still married
to his first wife when I met him,

1791
01:50:28,911 --> 01:50:31,625
so I knew what I was getting.

1792
01:50:33,462 --> 01:50:36,844
Mr. Flores, thank you for everything.

1793
01:50:36,927 --> 01:50:40,267
Is there anything I can do for you
to show you my gratitude?

1794
01:50:43,356 --> 01:50:47,364
Well, actually, there is.

1795
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,580
[Natalie] First it's a bike shop,
then a little bakery.

gentrification has erased
the heart and soul of our neighborhood!

1798
01:50:56,299 --> 01:50:57,802
- Yeah.
- Yes!

1799
01:50:57,886 --> 01:51:00,015
A friend of mine said recently,

1800
01:51:00,098 --> 01:51:02,245
- "You want bikes that don't go anywhere?"
- Excuse me.

1801
01:51:02,269 --> 01:51:06,277
I've just received notification
the developers have changed their mind.

[murmuring]

1803
01:51:08,198 --> 01:51:10,870
They've decided to call off the project.
It's not moving forward.

1804
01:51:10,954 --> 01:51:11,997
- What?
- [cheering]

1805
01:51:14,252 --> 01:51:16,005
- Honey, we...
- [laughing]

1806
01:51:17,258 --> 01:51:18,928
We did it! Yeah!

1807
01:51:19,011 --> 01:51:21,266
Kids. Come on.

1808
01:51:21,892 --> 01:51:23,019
Ready? Come on.

Now coming to you live from the scene

1816
01:52:03,433 --> 01:52:08,151
where FBI agents have just taken
Vincent Royce into custody

1817
01:52:08,234 --> 01:52:10,990
for allegations of embezzlement.

Police officials have yet to give
a statement at this time, but we will…

1819
01:52:16,669 --> 01:52:18,756
Okay, you're over-fluffing that.

1820
01:52:19,423 --> 01:52:20,611
Do you not want them fluffy now?

1821
01:52:20,635 --> 01:52:22,875
You said fluffy,
so why don't you just make up your mind?

1822
01:52:22,931 --> 01:52:24,744
- It's just too much. That's all.
- No, it's just...

1823
01:52:24,768 --> 01:52:27,008
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's just... You're just...

1824
01:52:27,064 --> 01:52:29,704
- Why are you so tense?
- I'm sorry. I just want to have breakfast.

1825
01:52:29,778 --> 01:52:31,883
- Why you so tense?
- Let's just... I'm... Stop, stop!

[bell chimes]

1827
01:52:37,459 --> 01:52:38,963
I need a bicycle for this wheel.

1828
01:52:39,589 --> 01:52:40,591
Hmm.

1829
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:42,846
Something like that?

1830
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:48,273
[laughing]

1831
01:52:48,356 --> 01:52:51,655
I bought it off a junkie in the park.
I figured you'd be back eventually.

1832
01:52:51,739 --> 01:52:53,491
- [Antonio] How?
- [chuckles]

1833
01:52:53,576 --> 01:52:54,995
That's amazing.

1834
01:52:56,707 --> 01:52:57,959
How much do I owe you?

1835
01:52:59,128 --> 01:53:00,798
- Eight bucks.
- Eight bucks?

1836
01:53:00,882 --> 01:53:02,202
Yeah, he was an awful negotiator.

1837

1838

Oh, hey. Did you hear? We get to stay.

1839
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:08,689
Yeah. Everybody does.

1840
01:53:08,773 --> 01:53:11,695
Yeah. I was really happy about that.

1841
01:53:11,779 --> 01:53:14,158
Yeah, no one knows
why they changed their minds.

1842
01:53:16,245 --> 01:53:19,418
Well, sometimes the good guys just win.

[laughs]

1844
01:53:22,424 --> 01:53:25,515
Uh, if you just give me a couple of hours,
I will have it up and running.

1845
01:53:25,598 --> 01:53:27,727
- Okay. Good.
- [laughs]

1846
01:53:27,811 --> 01:53:29,063
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

[bell chimes]

1848
01:53:46,849 --> 01:53:51,357
[Antonio] And then I thought,
"Come on. Go back and ask her out."

1849
01:53:55,950 --> 01:53:59,206
- So what happened? Did you go out?
- I-I-It was a little weird.

1850
01:53:59,290 --> 01:54:00,877
- [Olivia] Oh, why?
- [chuckles]

1851
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,716
I haven't been on a date,
like, in forever.

1852
01:54:03,799 --> 01:54:05,553
- Right.
- But it was just dinner.

1853
01:54:05,636 --> 01:54:07,356
I mean,
it's not like we're getting married.

1854
01:54:07,431 --> 01:54:09,811
But then she invited me
to see a band on Saturday,

1855
01:54:09,895 --> 01:54:12,149
so I think it went okay.

1856
01:54:12,232 --> 01:54:14,988
You're seeing a band. Did you kiss?

1857
01:54:17,326 --> 01:54:19,163
A gentleman never tells.

1858
01:54:19,246 --> 01:54:20,583
All right, so you kissed her.

1859
01:54:20,666 --> 01:54:22,521
- Think what you want.
- I think you kissed her.

1860
01:54:22,545 --> 01:54:24,841
- I'm not saying anything.
- I think you made out with her

1861
01:54:24,925 --> 01:54:28,097
- until the sun came up, is what I think.
- Hey, what? Hey, what are you doing?

1862
01:54:28,181 --> 01:54:30,310
- That's my pickle.
- I was eating a pickle,

1863
01:54:30,393 --> 01:54:33,232
- is what I was doing.
- Get your own pickle. That's mine.

1864
01:54:33,316 --> 01:54:37,282
Excuse me. I just want a bite
of a pickle. That's all I want.

1865
01:54:37,366 --> 01:54:41,625
Well, if you want more pickles,
order more pickles. I was saving it.

1866
01:54:42,292 --> 01:54:44,732
What? No, I just want a little bite.
I don't want a whole pickle.

1867
01:54:44,756 --> 01:54:47,762
Okay, I think I'm gonna cut
a small piece...

1868
01:54:47,845 --> 01:54:49,605
Fine. We will order
a whole plate of pickles.

1869
01:54:49,641 --> 01:54:52,831
- Oh, yeah. Take it. Just take my pickle.
- Excuse me. We need a plate of pickles.

1870
01:54:52,855 --> 01:54:54,961
- [Antonio] I don't like pickles!
- You don't like pickles?

1871
01:54:54,985 --> 01:54:57,615
- Okay. So, why were you saving it?
- [Antonio] I... Just because…

1872
01:54:58,867 --> 01:55:01,205
- …save pickles.
- [Olivia] Save pickles?

1873
01:55:01,288 --> 01:55:02,416
[Antonio] Yeah.
