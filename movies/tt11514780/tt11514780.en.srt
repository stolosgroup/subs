00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:49,166
I am sick of this, Gabe.
I do fucking everything for you.

3
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,083
I am your goddamn mother.

4
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,184
Oh really, Mom? Mom of the year.

5
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,208
You're fucking lucky
I didn't call the fucking police on you.

6
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,451
You're fucking lucky
she didn't call the police on you.

7
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,916
Do you wanna be on my side?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,666
I will always be on your side, Gabe.
I'm always on your side.

9
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,125
You're doing a fucking great job…
I look like a fucking idiot.

10
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,416
I look like a fucking idiot.
You screaming at me.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,559
- All my friends are watching.
- Did you see her face?

12
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:15,583
Did you see the way she looked at me?
And your father did nothing.

13
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,541
Ha! He's too busy
living in the '80s.

14
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,125
He's… He's playing with his toys.
His weird, creepy shit.

15
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,125
Oh, give me a break.

16
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,875
Cool.

17
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,708
<i>Retro… Retro… Retro weirdos.</i>

18
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,083
<i>Hiding in the '80s.</i>

19
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,041
<i>Who the…</i>
<i>Who the fuck is Barry Newman anyway?</i>

20
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,458
<i>It's Gary Numan. It's Gary…</i>
<i>It's… It's Gary Numan.</i>

21
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,083
<i> He fucks his vinyl</i>
<i>more than you… you… you…</i>

22
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,583
- "His tongue? Her ears?"
<i>- Those old movies… suck.</i>

23
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,166
What?

24
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,333
"His tongue? Her ears?"

25
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,458
<i>He's just a fucking loser.</i>
<i>He's just a fucking loser.</i>

26
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,250
<i> Loser… Loser… Loser…</i>

27
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,666
Guys?

28
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,250
Laura?

29
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,416
Honey?

30
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,291
I don't know what happened.

31
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,250
It's short.

32
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,500
I got less out of you than the others.
You're lazy.

33
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,958
I'm pregnant.

34
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,791
So you're stupid and lazy.

35
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,250
Don't speak to her like that.

36
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,000
Maybe I don't need you tonight.

37
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,583
Come on.

38
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,916
You think you're special.
You're not fucking special.

39
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,458
Come on, baby.

40
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,416
Oh, just look at you.

41
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
I am so fucking smart.

42
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,541
God, you're so beautiful.

43
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,833
Hey. Hey!

44
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,583
How is the character design coming?

45
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,333
- Uh, great.
- Want me to check your code?

46
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,041
Mmm, no. No. I am…

47
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,375
- Okay.
- You got the nose wrong.

48
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,833
It is not… It's not supposed to be…
It's just an idea.

49
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,916
It's just an idea.

50
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,916
Oh, what is that?

51
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,958
- What do you mean? What, Fad Gadget?
- Come on.

52
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,000
Synth pioneer from the greatest decade
in pop-culture history?

53
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,666
You shouldn't listen to stuff like that.
It's bad for you.

54
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,750
It's not ba…

55
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
You loved the last thing I played for you.

56
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,291
Run-DMC.

57
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,166
You think you turned me on to Run-DMC?

58
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,166
How's that job hunt going?

59
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,625
I'm on 27 "fuck yous" and counting, so…

60
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,708
That's why you don't drop out.
You gotta go back and graduate.

61
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,666
Well, hey, look, once my game's picked up,

62
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,375
you can come program for me, full-time.

63
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,791
At the House of Isaac?

64
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,166
- The House of Isaac?
- Yeah.

65
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,690
That's actually pretty good.

66
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,625
Nice.

67
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,875
Just some, like,
solders need fixing.

68
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,208
Nice.

69
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,458
This thing is
a retro collector's wet dream.

70
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,708
- Is 70 okay?
- They're only selling them for 90.

71
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,083
But I am paying for the art.

72
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,291
New stock?

73
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,875
Yeah. I mean, it's just
a load of junk really, but…

74
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,166
Sorry. Oh…

75
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,083
God, it's, uh… Sorry about the mess.

76
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,916
I've seen it a lot worse.

77
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,666
My mom won't eat here.
She says it's not sanitary.

78
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,583
I mean, I don't really like eating here,

79
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,041
with the bugs and the overwhelming sense
of existential…

80
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,250
Hey, you eaten? There's this karaoke place
that does breakfast.

81
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,666
They make you sing
before they bring out the menu.

82
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,875
We could do our duet...

83
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,833
Hey, I can try and clean this up for you.

84
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, sure, uh, take it.

85
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,791
- Um…
- What's this?

86
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,750
Uh, I don't… know?

87
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,833
Looks like a bootleg.

88
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,833
With a 125 grand prize?

89
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,708
<i>Curs>r.</i>

90
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,208
That's actually quite a good name.

91
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,166
Not as good as<i> Ghoster, </i>but…

92
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,375
Think the prize is still good?

93
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,833
I don't know. I mean, there are a ton
of unclaimed prizes from retro games.

94
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,875
Couple of months ago,
I read about this guy.

95
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,708
He was the first person in 34 years
to complete<i> Thou Art Dead.</i>

96
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,416
He found a treasure chest in a dungeon
with a bank account number.

97
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:46,125
<i>Greetings,</i>
<i>this is Robert Englund,</i>

98
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,458
<i>horror royalty and Hollywood nightmare.</i>

99
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,666
No fucking way.

100
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,630
<i>Or should that be</i>
<i>the other way around?</i>

101
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,708
What?

102
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,833
<i> If you're listening to this,</i>
<i>then you're either a loser</i>

103
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,041

105
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,250
That is so cool!

106
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,041
- What is...
<i>- So, congratulations.</i>

107
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,416
<i>You are worthy.</i>

108
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,166
- Oh my God.
- What? Who is that?

109
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,458
<i>Enter your four-digit prize code
after the tone.</i>

110
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:16,291
- "Who's that?" Fuck yeah.
<i>- And remember, reality is cursed.</i>

111
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,541
That is so cool!

112
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,000
<i>Spend that money wisely, kiddos.</i>

113
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,791
Robert Englund?

114
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,750
Who the fuck is that?

115
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,416
Oh, come on.

116
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,333
Oh, you…
Your pop-culture ignorance

117
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,875
is becoming unacceptable, bitch.

118
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,625
You know that. You know that.

119
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,541
I just... I didn't just call you a bitch.

120
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,625
Oh God.

121
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,458
Could be easy money.

122
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,500
Yeah. Yeah. Wait, no.
Technically, that is mine.

123
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,041
- You know Wilkies on 37th?
- Yes, I do.

124
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,208
Meet me there tonight at…

125
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,208
1:30.

126
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,000
- It's a date.
- It's a deal.

127
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,041
Just help yourself.

128
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,666
I work! I work! I vacuum. I…

129
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,541
I'm home.

130
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,125
<i>…record our voices, okay?</i>

131
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,666
<i>- Ready?</i>
<i>- I wanna go swimming.</i>

132
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,541
<i>We're gonna</i>
<i>go swimming in a minute.</i>

133
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,458
<i>- Ricky...</i>
<i>- Will you look this time?</i>

134
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,083
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>I always look.</i>

135
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,708
<i>You didn't look</i>
<i>when I did my big jump last week.</i>

136
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,000
<i> Right, let's do it again.</i>
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

137
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,166
<i> Love you, Mommy.</i>

138
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,000
<i>You see here,</i>
<i>we have to talk in the ear</i>

139
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,333
<i>and then it will record our voices, okay?</i>

140
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,125
<i>- Ready?</i>
<i>- I wanna go swimming.</i>

141
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,041
<i>We're gonna</i>
<i>go swimming in a minute.</i>

142
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,916
<i>- Ricky...</i>
<i>- Will you look this time?</i>

143
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,458
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>I always look.</i>

144
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,666
<i>You didn't look</i>
<i>when I did my big jump last week.</i>

145
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,458
<i>Right, let's do it again.</i>
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

146
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,625
<i> Love you, Mommy.</i>

147
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,958
Mom.

148
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,375
Don't let Lance in here again.

149
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,000
He's not helping you.

150
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,291
The walls.

151
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:56,916
Huh?

152
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,416
The rats…

153
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,750
They're in the walls now.

154
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,291
They're hungry.

155
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,333
I'll, uh, set another trap later.

156
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,083
I was thinking
we could go for a walk tomorrow.

157
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,333
To the park maybe?

158
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,666
<i>You see here,</i>
<i>we have to talk in the ear</i>

159
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,458
<i>and then it will record our voices, okay?</i>

160
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,017
<i>- Ready?</i>
<i>- I wanna go swimming.</i>

161
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:36,875
<i>We're gonna...</i>

162
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,208
- Hey, Carmella?
- Hmm?

163
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,000
Ever wonder why
they have us doing this shit?

164
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,041
'Cause they think it's all we're good for.

165
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,083
I mean, this place is fucking empty.

166
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,208
They got us cleaning the floors
night after night.

167
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,708
Oh yeah, I've given it a lot of thought
over the past few months.

168
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,250
Pushed it around in my mind, you know?
Really considered it.

169
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:52,291
Last week, I finally settled
on what you might call a firm conclusion.

170
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,666
Long as they keep paying me,
I don't give a fuck.

171
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,750
You gonna order something else?

172
00:17:54,541 --> 00:18:00,250
Sorry, I'd let you sit there all night,
but my asshole boss wakes up, then…

173
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,125
Give me a minute.

174
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,583
Yeah, sure.

175
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,791
Uh, menu's right there.

176
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,041
Coffee.

177
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,166
Say "when."

178
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,250
- Did you...
- Not saying "when."

179
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,291
- I'm just gonna keep pouring.
- When. When.

180
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,250
I'm only messing with you.

181
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,041
Sorry.

182
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,833
Are you... Are you all right?

183
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,583
I'm okay.

184
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,625
You do not look okay.

185
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,500
Hey, how'd you do that?

186
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,458
Do what?

187
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,875
To my screen. The words came up
right when you said them.

188
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:44,500
I think that maybe
we both need some sleep.

189
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,458
You have to choose, Kayla.

190
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,166
Choose or die.

191
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,041
I gotta take a fucking break. Yes.

192
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,500
Clean up.

193
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Stop!

194
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:02,916
Please.

195
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,541
I… I can't.

196
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,916
I can't…

197
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,583
It hurts. It hurts.

198
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:16,916
Stop!

199
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,041
I can't stop.

200
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,875
Help her. We have to help...

201
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,416
Please. Please stop.

202
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,666
Fuck. Help!

203
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,958
I can't…

204
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,833
Fuck.

205
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,708
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's just a question.

206
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,208
- She's my daughter.
- Of course.

207
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,083
She works very hard.

208
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,886
I didn't mean
to suggest anything.

209
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,958
My colleague spoke to Kayla
at the scene of the suicide last night.

210
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,875
This is a real tragedy.

211
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,958
My family's seen its fair share.

212
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,875
There used to be three of us.

213
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,208
It's… It's okay.

214
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,333
This your little boy in the picture here?

215
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:09,916
That's him.

216
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,041
Losing a kid is the toughest.

217
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,708
Got my own two boys,
and I can't imagine ever...

218
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,541
Can I get you a drink or something?

219
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:19,791
No, I'm good.

220
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:25,958
Once Kayla's rested, I'd like to follow up
on her statement if that's okay.

221
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,166
This used to be a good neighborhood.

222
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,250
We were happy.

223
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,291
We were.

224
00:24:58,541 --> 00:24:59,541
You okay there, bump?

225
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,666
You haven't called me that in years.

226
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,375
- Mom, something happened...
- Is it still there?

227
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:12,875
The pool.

228
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,000
They tore it down, remember?

229
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,666
- They don't work.
- They're all we can afford.

230
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,791
Lance can help.

231
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,583
You keep taking his shit,
you're gonna die. Is that what you want?

232
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,875
Is that what you want?

233
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,208
This used to be a good neighborhood.

234
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,083
<i> You see here,</i>
<i>we have to talk in the ear</i>

235
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,958
<i>and then it will record our voices, okay?</i>

236
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,708
<i>- Ready?</i>
<i>- I wanna go swimming.</i>

237
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:54,083
There's my girl.

238
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:57,166
Saw you had a visit.

239
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,541
Fuck you, Lance.

240
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,083
Can't have you talking about me.

241
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,291
Pick up some coffee, would you?
Your mom's out.

242
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,166
Stay the fuck away from her.

243
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,750
Hey, it's my responsibility
to look out for the residents.

244
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:15,500
There's no cure for what your mama's got.

245
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,833
- I got the medicine...
- Keep that shit out of my house.

246
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:23,041
- I know you guys been through a lot.
- You don't know anything about us.

247
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,666
"Dear, Miss Edwards,

248
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:32,333
thank you for your application
for the position of junior programmer."

249
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,916
That's mine.

250
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,750
"Now, unfortunately,
we regret to inform you…" Ooh.

251
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,958
When you gonna learn? Nobody around here
ever amounts to nothin'.

252
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,708
Saw the eviction notice too.

253
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,416
You need money, you come to me.

254
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,583
Anything to help…

255
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,291
Miss Edwards.

256
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:20,333
I don't know how many more times
I can explain to you what happened.

257
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,041
Yeah, I know. I know. It's just…

258
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,458
I don't see how a video game
can kill someone.

259
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,250
I mean <i>Pac-Man</i>
doesn't go around eating people.

260
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,791
So what? I know what I saw.

261
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:36,916
Yeah, no, I know, and she sounds crazy.

262
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,916
She's not fucking crazy. She was fine.

263
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,291
Everything was fine,
then the game took control.

264
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:44,333
- Is that what you told the cops?
- It's what I'm telling you.

265
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,041
You don't believe me?

266
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,833
Kayla… Hey… Hey, I wanna believe you.

267
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:54,142
- Just tell me where it came from.
- I don't know.

268
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,708
I have no way of knowing.
It's house clearance.

269
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,916
- Just in a lot...
- What fucking use are you?

270
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Wait.

271
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,708
Let me do some research.

272
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,708
- I'll get to the bottom of this.
- Yeah, you do that.

273
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,666
You're so fucking smart.

274
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,333
Fuck.

275
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:41,291
<i>Kayla. Kayla! Kayla!</i>

276
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:43,333
Mom, what's wrong?
Why aren't you sleeping?

277
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:46,250
<i>I can… I can hear them.</i>

278
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,625
<i>The rats. They're getting out.</i>

279
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,375
I'll set another trap later.

280
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,208
<i>No, no, no.</i>

281
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,041
<i>They're here! They're here!</i>

282
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,500
What are you talking about?

283
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,541
<i>Kayla...</i>

284
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,785
<i>Shoo!</i>

285
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,833
<i>Level two.</i>

286
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,625
<i>You are in a tower.</i>

287
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,041
<i>Please, Kay...</i>

288
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,875
<i>Kayla, you have to help me.</i>

289
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,708
<i>I can't do this on my own.</i>

290
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:32,333
<i>I don't know what to do, Kayla.
I don't know what to do.</i>

291
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,833
You gotta get out of there.

292
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,416
<i> I can't get out. I can hear it.</i>

293
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,666
<i>Choose.</i>
<i>The living room or the bathroom?</i>

294
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,125
Mom, you're… you're in the bedroom?

295
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,666
<i> Yeah, I'm in the bedroom.</i>

296
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,333
<i>Choose or die.</i>

297
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,583
- Get to the living room.
<i>- I can't. It's gonna see me.</i>

298
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,125
Go quick. Hide behind the couch.

299
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,625
<i> I can't. I can't move.</i>

300
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,750
<i>- I cannot move from here!</i>
- Trust me.

301
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,416
<i> Kayla, help me!</i>
<i>I'm gonna go and hide.</i>

302
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,333
<i>- I'm gonna go and hide!</i>
- No! No!

303
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,041
<i>It's destroying everything.</i>

304
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,000
<i>I can hear it.</i>

305
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,000
<i>There's no meat</i>
<i>in the living room. You're hungry.</i>

306
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:10,208
It's trying to make me hurt you.

307
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,750
<i>Bathroom or bedroom?</i>

308
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,166
{\an8}<i>Kayla. </i>

309
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,083
<i>Choose or die.</i>

310
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,875
Wait there till I tell you to run.

311
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,625
<i>What? What? What?</i>

312
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,791
<i>Run where? Run where?</i>

313
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:26,791
Bathroom. It's in the bathroom.
I want you to go right past.

314
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,750
- Go straight for the front door.
<i>- No.</i>

315
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,333
I need you to go right now.

316
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:33,208
- Mom, do you see it? Go! Now!
<i>- No, I cannot. I can't.</i>

317
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,125
{\an8}<i>Okay! Okay!</i>

318
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,625
{\an8}<i>There's no meat</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

319
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,166
- <i>Meat.</i>
- No, no, no!

320
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,750
Shut the fucking door!

321
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,625
<i>The bedroom door is locked.</i>

322
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,833
<i>Kayla, I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!</i>

323
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,596
<i>- Help me!</i>
<i>- Charge it? Chew it?</i>

324
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,958
<i> I can't do it, Kayla!</i>
<i>I can't do this!</i>

325
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,416
- <i>Choose or die.</i>
<i>- I don't wanna die.</i>

326
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:05,916
<i>Kayla, I love…</i>
<i>I love you, and I am so sorry.</i>

327
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Go to the window.

328
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,750
<i> I can't do it, Kayla!</i>

329
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,916
You have to!

330
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,250
<i>Choose or die.</i>

331
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,708
<i> Kayla,</i>
<i>I can't hold the door!</i>

332
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:20,416
<i>Oh Jesus Christ!</i>

333
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,541
- Move, Mom!
<i>- I can see it! I can see it!</i>

334
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,666
<i>Help me! Somebody help me!</i>

335
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,750
<i> The meat is so close</i>
<i>you can taste it.</i>

336
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:30,791
<i>No, no, no!</i>

337
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:31,791
Jump.

338
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,166
<i>It's too high!</i>

339
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,041
<i>I can't!</i>

340
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,375
<i>Jump out the fucking window!</i>

341
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,000
<i> A worthy player.</i>

342
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:55,875
<i>Same time again tomorrow for more terror.</i>

343
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,750
Kayla! What the fuck?

344
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,333
You are fired.

345
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,333
<i>...on line 1.</i>

346
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:36,041
- Where's Ricky?
- Mom.

347
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,125
Ricky.

348
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,708
He wants to go swimming.

349
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,083
Why did you say that? Did you see him?

350
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,583
<i> I can… I can hear them.</i>

351
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,375
<i>The rats. They're getting out.</i>

352
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,916
<i>You are in a tower.</i>

353
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,416
<i>They're here! They're here!</i>

354
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:32,458
<i>Kayla, I don't know what to do!</i>
<i>I don't know what to do!</i>

355
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:33,833
<i>You have to help me!</i>

356
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:37,416
<i>Choose or die.</i>

357
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,625
<i>Kayla, I don't wanna die.</i>

358
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:52,750
<i>There's no meat</i>
<i>in the living room.</i>

359
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:53,875
<i>You're hungry.</i>

360
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:13,166
<i>Kayla, I can't hold the door!</i>

361
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,666
<i>Oh Jesus Christ!</i>

362
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,583
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

363
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,333
<i>Meat.</i>

364
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:50,750
You trashed the place, huh?
Landlord's gonna love this.

365
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,458
- Get out.
- I gotta report it.

366
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,875
- Unless…
- Fuck you.

367
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:55,791
Maybe.

368
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,000
What are you worth?

369
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,750
Ten dollars? Fifteen for the hour?

370
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,375
You take one more step,
you'll find out what I'm worth.

371
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:08,791
Everyone in the neighborhood
used to look to your mom and be like…

372
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:10,541
Well…

373
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,000
She was really somethin'.

374
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,791
Anyone was gonna make it out,
it was gonna be her.

375
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:26,916
I got a 20.

376
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,750
I am coming.

377
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:03,958
Kayla?

378
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,500
- What the fuck?
- You have to believe me.

379
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,708
I… I believe you.
I believe you. Come inside.

380
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:12,541
This is some fucked up shit.
Be sure before you get involved.

381
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,625
I'm sure.

382
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,083
I'm sure, okay?
Just get in. You're soaked.

383
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:22,583
You weren't kidding.
This is some fucked up shit.

384
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,583
Can we turn it on?

385
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,125
I tried.

386
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:33,125
But listen, I checked what time
it started itself up last night. -00 a.m.

387
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,791
Same time as when I first opened it
the night before.

388
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,625
I think we gotta wait till then.

389
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,958
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

390
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,625
Okay? After you left,
I tried to find out what I could.

391
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,750
It was a dead end.
And there's nothing online.

392
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,541
Literally. Not even an honorary mention
on the forums.

393
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,291
The prize line number's delisted.

394
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:03,500
I wanted to see if somehow
it was much more contemporary technology,

395
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:06,083
but there's nothing in the code
that'd begin to explain…

396
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:09,208
I mean, yeah,
it's just ordinary wrapper code.

397
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,375
Yeah,
so what's inside the wrapper?

398
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:17,000
Well, some old games have code hidden
in the analog loading sound itself.

399
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,833
- Sound is data.
- We could try to separate out the sound?

400
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,541
Yes, we should.

401
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,541
Yes, we should, Kayla.

402
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,375
Okay.

403
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:29,583
Where are you?

404
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,750
When it loads, we'll be ready.

405
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:41,416
You know what I mean? I feel like
we're just scratching the surface

406
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,875
of interaction in, like, player choices.

407
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:47,000
Even just cheat codes.
They're cool, but they're a bit standard.

408
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,958
You know? You get left, right, A, B.

409
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,791
You get to skip a level, or you power up.

410
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,375
It's cool, but it's just easy.

411
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,291
I am gonna reinvent the whole idea.

412
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,750
So in my game,
if you wanna cheat, it's gonna cost you.

413
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,666
Like, uh… Like it's gonna hurt.

414
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,416
Am I boring you?

415
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:08,666
No.

416
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,500
I am. I am boring you.

417
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,083
No, really. It's…

418
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:16,666
It's good that you're making
something new.

419
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,250
Something that's yours.

420
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,083
Those, um…

421
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,958
Those designs you saw?
Those are just sketches by the way.

422
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:27,833
Those… They don't mean anything.

423
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,625
I like that you made me look
like a superhero.

424
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:36,708
Well, gotta make sure
you use your powers wisely.

425
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:38,708
You're such a dick.

426
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,500
Whoa! Hey, what the fuck was that for?

427
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,083
Do not start a food fight with me.
I am a grand master.

428
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,333
Go. Kayla.

429
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,416
- Ew.
- Sto... Did I get it in your mouth? Ah!

430
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,208
Hey, hey! This is our song.

431
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,916
We don't have a song.

432
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,375
What do you mean?
We listened to this, like, four times.

433
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,625
That doesn't make it our song.

434
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,291
God, do you like anything about me?

435
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:10,916
It's time.

436
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,791
Oh shit. It's time?

437
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,625
Wait.

438
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:18,333
- Isaac, hurry up.
- Okay. Oh, there's something.

439
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,166
Uh… Let me…

440
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,416
Wait. Hold on.

441
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,166
That is fucking evil.

442
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,541
Oh.

443
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:35,291
I don't know what that is. What is that?
It's not like anything I've ever seen.

444
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,125
And, like, it's got this weird gap.

445
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,583
If it's coding language,
there should be a cursor.

446
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:42,541
- Some kind of command prompt?
- There should, but there's nothing.

447
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,666
- Fuck!
- There's nothing...

448
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:46,916
"Level 3."

449
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,083
"You are with a loyal squire."

450
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:54,083
A squire?
Have you been talking to this thing?

451
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,875
"Prove yourself worthy of the prize.
Isaac looks…"

452
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,083
How is it doing that?

453
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,625
Ah.

454
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:13,958
Wha...

455
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:17,500
It's… It's almost putting the words
on the screen before I say…

456
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,333
Them.

457
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,250
Okay.

458
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,041
Uh…

459
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:27,875
Well, maybe these symbols
help it interact with reality.

460
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,458
Bad idea.

461
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,642
- "Help? No help?"
- Isaac, be careful.

462
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,184
- It's gonna try hurting you.
- My help?

463
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,892
- We shouldn't play.
- Choose or die?

464
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,083
- Bad idea.
- Gotta choose.

465
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:38,708
No, we shouldn't. No, stop. Stop!

466
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:40,833
Hey! Oh God!

467
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,708
What do I do?

468
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,541
Make it stop!

469
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,041
What the fuck was that?

470
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:57,291
You okay?

471
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,458
Get up. All right.

472
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,083
Oh fuck.

473
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,916
That is some fucked up shit.

474
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,333
I mean, how… How is that even possible?

475
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:41,750
Blue or red?

476
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Never pick red.

477
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:48,666
Trust me.

478
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,666
It's locked.

479
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:06,291
<i> Die.</i>

480
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,708
- What the fuck?
- Well, red's not so bad.

481
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:18,875
Anything?

482
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:21,875
It's quiet.

483
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:46,333
Red's not so bad.
Red's not so bad.

484
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:49,166
Red's not so bad.

485
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,500
<i> I wanna go swimming.</i>

486
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,833
Kayla. Wait. Wait.

487
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,083
- Kayla.
<i>- I wanna go swimming now.</i>

488
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,375
- Ricky, stop.
- Wait. Kayla.

489
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:45,875
Ricky!

490
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,750
- Ricky!
<i>- Let's go.</i>

491
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,458
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- Wait.

492
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:51,916
- <i>Let's go.</i>
- Stop.

493
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,309
- <i>Let's go!</i>
- Wait!

494
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,458
- Kayla. Wait.
<i>- Let's go!</i>

495
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,041
The fuck is this place?

496
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:06,833
It's where my brother drowned.

497
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:08,250
<i>I wanna go swimming.</i>

498
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,625
- Ricky.
- No. Kayla, Kayla, remember.

499
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:15,166
It's not real. It knows you.

500
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,000
Don't… Don't let it play you.

501
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:18,791
Stop! Ricky!

502
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,875
- Shit.
- Ricky!

503
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,541
Kayla!

504
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,083
Kayla, Kayla, Kayla. Can you hear me?

505
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,500
Fuck! Fuck!

506
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Come on.

507
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:37,541
Okay, I'm coming in.

508
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:40,166
I'm coming in.

509
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:53,875
Ricky?

510
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,083
<i>Will you look this time?</i>

511
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:58,791
Where are you?

512
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:02,291
Fuck.

513
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:04,250
I can't see shit.

514
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,375
Kayla?

515
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,166
Kayla!

516
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,333
Fuck.

517
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:14,500
Kayla, say something!

518
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:17,833
Kayla!

519
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:19,666
Ricky?

520
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:22,041
<i> Will you look?</i>

521
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:24,416
Ricky?

522
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,666
<i> Isaac.</i>

523
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:33,250
- Is that you?
<i>- Look at me, Kayla.</i>

524
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,333
Ricky?

525
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:37,791
Oh fuck!

526
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,275
<i> What are you talking about?</i>

527
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:43,916
<i>You have to talk in the ear, and then
it will record our voices, okay? Ready?</i>

528
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,250
- <i>You're not… looking.</i>
<i>- You're gonna go swimming in a minute.</i>

529
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,916
<i>Will you look this time?</i>

530
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,791
<i> Look!</i>

531
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,166
Kayla.

532
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,833
Help! Help!

533
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:05,250
Isaac?

534
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:10,833
Isaac?

535
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:13,708
Isaac.

536
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:19,083
No.

537
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:29,708
No.

538
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:52,291
Please...

539
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
Fuck.

540
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:48,208
Hey.

541
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:54,458
You all right?

542
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,125
That wasn't your brother back there,
you know that.

543
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,625
That's why I chose you.

544
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:23,666
He loved the water.

545
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:29,375
Mom was always working,
so I used to take him swimming.

546
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:33,000
Well, I say swimming, but he just liked
to splash and play and jump around.

547
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,833
And the one time I looked away…

548
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:40,000
I don't know why.
It was just for a few seconds.

549
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:46,041
And when I looked back, he was…

550
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,958
That was it. He was lying face down.

551
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:51,583
That doesn't make it your fault.

552
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:54,166
Nobody's ever said it was,

553
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:58,583
but… that doesn't change how I feel.

554
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,500
And this thing…

555
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:08,666
It knew that.

556
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:19,375
It made me do it with my own hands.
It wanted to make me suffer.

557
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,625
Someday you gotta forgive yourself.

558
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:42,958
How much do you know about zines?

559
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,500
The whole '80s cult thing.

560
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:50,583
And no, I promise it's not
one of my obscure retro fetishes. Look.

561
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:55,666
So kids used to play these games
with a dial-up.

562
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:59,166
Spend a dollar for the first minute,
45 cents for every minute after.

563
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,250
And you choose one or two,

564
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,541
and they could play for hours,

565
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:07,416
until their parents got, like,
a $500 phone bill.

566
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,000
Then they had to get creative.

567
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:13,791
And back then, everything was analog,
like, phone routing, sound…

568
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,125
And once they figured out
what the tones meant,

569
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:20,416
they could hack into the phone lines,
play for free.

570
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,708
And once you're in the phone lines,
then you'd find out anything.

571
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:26,041
So…

572
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:30,333
We could try the same hack?

573
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,416
Track the prize line number
using the dial tones?

574
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,980
I'm already there.

575
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:42,958
Upstate.

576
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:46,500
We got ten hours till the next level.

577
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:48,916
Better get going.

578
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,583
You're doing this 'cause you wanna help me
or you wanna get with me?

579
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:57,375
Both.

580
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:04,250
Oh, one more thing.

581
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,875
My car, my music.

582
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:09,916
- Oh, don't make me listen to your shit.
- No, you love my shit.

583
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,708
{\an8}<i>Isaac, come on.</i>
<i>Watch where you're going.</i>

584
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,750
{\an8}<i>- Who taught you to drive?</i>
<i>- I taught myself… mostly.</i>

585
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:22,833
{\an8}<i>Watch out. Watch out.</i>

586
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,166
{\an8}<i>Slow the fuck down.</i>

587
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:36,250
- How long till the next level starts?
- About six hours.

588
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:03,000
Guess we're going in?

589
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,083
You all right?

590
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,750
We gotta find something to bust this open.

591
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:44,291
That works too.

592
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,041
What now?

593
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,041
Where is that?

594
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:28,458
It's coming from there.

595
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,141
<i>Greetings.</i>

596
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,708
<i>This is Robert Englund,</i>

597
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,750
<i>horror royalty and Hollywood nightmare.</i>

598
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,083
<i>Or should that be the other way around?</i>

599
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:45,041
<i>If you're listening to this,
then you're either a loser</i>

600
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,791
<i>who isn't paying
Mommy and Daddy's phone bill,</i>

601
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:51,916
<i>or you have survived </i>Curs>r.

602
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:56,791
<i>So, congratulations.</i>

603
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,416
<i>You are worthy.</i>

604
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:04,083
<i>Enter your four-digit prize code
after the tone.</i>

605
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,833
<i>And remember, reality is cursed.</i>

606
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:14,375
<i>Spend that money wise...</i>

607
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,541
Guess we can forget that prize.

608
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:42,541
There's gotta be something.
There's gotta be.

609
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,000
Hey, hey.

610
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,250
Power cables.

611
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:58,125
They gotta go somewhere, right?

612
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,125
It goes in here.

613
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:09,875
Oh shit.

614
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:12,583
Oh.

615
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,791
Why leave it like this?

616
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,000
They made the game here.

617
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:47,750
Sorry.

618
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,083
<i>"Curs>r</i> Beta 1."

<i>or translate its exact meaning,</i>

624

<i>but we know it has unusual properties.</i>

625
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:31,458
<i>Its symbols seem to affect reality.</i>

<i>Each of them means something.</i>

00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:00,625
<i>And the more the cursed suffer,</i>

637
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,291
<i>the more the curser benefits.</i>

638
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:09,458
<i>We've converted the original symbols
into 8-bit equivalents,</i>

639
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:13,750
<i>contained them within
a simple horror game experience,</i>

640
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,083
Choose or Die.

641
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,958
- Choose...
- What the fuck does that mean?

642
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:20,333
Someo… Someone's been doing this to me?

643
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:21,958
<i>I will start the test now.</i>

644
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:29,791
I am the curser.

645
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,333
As I cause suffering…

646
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:36,291
I will reap the rewards.

647
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:41,208
The test has started.

648
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:44,833
Curs>r. <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>real fucking original, man.</i>

649
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:47,791
<i>Okay…</i>

650
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,791
<i>"You've been waiting for hours."</i>

651
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:53,166
<i>"They promised you food, but where is it?"</i>

652
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,500
<i>"Eat the computer?"</i>

653
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:00,166
<i>"Eat your arm?"</i>

654
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:03,541
<i>What is this, man?</i>

655
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,375
Just choose one.

656
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:12,333
<i>- This is bullshit.</i>
- You… You want your money? Hmm?

657
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:13,958
Choose.

658
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:17,375
<i>Hey, when this is over, when I get
my money, I'm gonna mess you up.</i>

659
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:19,166
<i>Arm.</i>

660
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:28,541
<i>Hey.</i>

661
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:33,333
<i>Hey.</i>

662
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:34,916
Watch.

663
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:46,625
Keep shooting. Get it all.

664
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,833
It works. It works.

665
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:18,833
It's incredible!

666
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:20,458
That can't be real.

667
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,625
<i>Sometimes…</i>

668
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:27,416
<i>Sometimes, a curse can be a gift.</i>

669
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,083
This bit guy is fucking insane.

670
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:37,333
I mean, we gotta tell them.
We gotta tell the police.

671
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:38,666
- Or...
- See those?

672
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,666
The symbol's the command prompt. Isn't it?

673
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:42,791
It's the command prompt.
It's what we were missing.

674
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:45,000
We gotta get out.
We'll take it back to mine.

675
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:46,958
The fuck?

676
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,934
What is that, Kayla?

677
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:50,833
What's going on?

678
01:00:50,916 --> 01:00:53,791
It's too soon. Too fucking soon!

679
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:57,083
<i>Level four. You're in 1984.</i>

680
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:59,166
We gotta go. Kayla, we gotta go.

681
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:02,041
<i>I'm gonna reinvent the whole idea.</i>

682
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:05,250
<i>In my game, if you wanna cheat…</i>

683
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:06,208
How's he doing that?

684
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,166
<i>…It's gonna cost you.</i>

685
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,892
- It knows we cheated.
- Isaac, no.

686
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:12,583
<i>Oh my, it's gonna hurt.</i>

687
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,541
What the fuck?

688
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:18,625
What's happening?

689
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:26,166
<i>Rewind or fast-forward?</i>

690
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,291
Isaac?

691
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:30,541
<i>Rewind or fast-forward?</i>

692
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,458
Help, Kayla.

693
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,708
<i>Choose or die.</i>

694
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:37,958
<i>Choose or die.</i>

695
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:40,375
<i>Choose or die.</i>

696
01:01:57,583 --> 01:02:01,708
<i>Rewind or fast-forward?</i>

697
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:04,708
<i>Rewind or fast-forward?</i>

698
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,708
<i>Choose or die.</i>

699
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:20,958
<i>Choose or die.</i>

700
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:22,166
<i>Choose or die.</i>

701
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,041
- Do it.
<i>- Choose or die.</i>

702
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,208
<i>Choose...</i>

703
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:33,916
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

704
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,041
I'm sorry.

705
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,625
<i>Level four complete.</i>

706
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:56,291
You're okay.

707
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:00,541
What did we… What did we win?

708
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:02,416
Don't speak.

709
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:05,750
- I...
- It's okay. It's okay.

710
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:14,291
I totally turned you on
to... Run-DMC.

711
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,500
You're so fucking smart.

712
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:34,666
You're okay.

713
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:37,916
Isaac…

714
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,750
Isaac.

715
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:48,125
<i>Now beat the boss.</i>

716
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,458
- Mom?
<i>- Hey.</i>

717
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,666
Where the fuck are you?

718
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,583
- Why do you have her phone?
<i>- She's resting.</i>

719
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:59,541
It's been decided. When she's better,
she's coming home with me.

720
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:02,166
I'm gonna take care
of everything she needs.

721
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:03,750
Let me speak to her.

722
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,166
We're gonna play happy families.

723
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:01,625
Okay, you motherfucker.

724
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,458
Now the light fades out.

725
01:06:57,708 --> 01:07:00,250
And I'm wondering
what I'm doing in a room like this.

726
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,083
There's a knock on the door.

727
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:11,208
Just for a second
I thought I remembered you.

728
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:15,041
Amen.

729
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:23,916
Who are you?

730
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,458
A player.

731
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:33,750
Won't you sit down?

732
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:01,708
How did you find us?

733
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,208
It sent me here.

734
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,166
Why would it do that?

735
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,000
You tell me.

736
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:20,958
You still playing?

737
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:23,958
Not exactly.

738
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:30,625
I collect things, you know.

739
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,750
From… from when I was your age.

740
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:37,000
You probably don't know what they are.

741
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:40,083
I mean, everything's
in the cloud for you kids.

742
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,916
So I, uh… I picked up the game

743
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,583
in a clearance site.

744
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:50,333
I thought it'd pass
a couple of minutes, but…

745
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:55,000
But I think I woke it up.

746
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,541
And then…

747
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:02,208
After two levels,

748
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:05,458
it promised to leave us alone

749
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,041
if I made copies.

750
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:12,833
My friend is dead.

751
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,166
I, uh…

752
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:21,791
I really am devastated.

753
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:23,000
Fuck you.

754
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:30,625
If it sent you here,
it can't be for anything good.

755
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,833
- You bastard!
- You let her go.

756
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:37,166
It's okay… son.

757
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,541
There's nothing to be afraid of.

758
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:42,833
Now, everybody...

759
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:47,250
Everybody just sit down.

760
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,833
You know what I think?

761
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,375
I think you might be
what it was looking for.

762
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:08,666
"Final level."

763
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,125
"Boss battle."

764
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,708
It thinks I'm the final level boss

765
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:18,166
and you're the hero?

766
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:21,458
Oh, that's… that's not fair.

767
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:24,208
Aren't guys like me

768
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:28,125
allowed to be the fucking hero anymore?

769
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,583
- You know, in the '80s...
- Fuck the '80s.

770
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:34,041
Fuck the '80s?

771
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:36,625
You wanna be the hero?

772
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:39,458
Prove yourself worthy.

773
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:51,041
Choose or die.

774
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:09,125
What the fuck?

775
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:50,083
Don't shoot her, shoot me!

776
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:53,833
You fucking idiot! Shoot me, not her!

777
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:05,583
No. No.

778
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:06,708
Laura, no!

779
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:10,041
No! No!

780
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:14,958
Do it.

781
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,500
Again.

782
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,833
Let go, you fucking bitch.

783
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:26,000
Fuck you!

784
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:28,208
You're gonna fucking pay for this.

785
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,250
Fu...

786
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:47,000
Fuck.

787
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:49,041
No, Gabe!

788
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:50,541
No, Gabe, no, no!

789
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:07,791
Yeah. Yeah.

790
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:12,333
I'm the fucking hero!

791
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:48,000
You were never here.

792
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,833
Thank you.

793
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:52,333
It's the least I can do.

794
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,583
You saved my life.

795
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,083
Are you gonna be okay?

796
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:02,791
We'll survive.

797
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,083
What is that?

798
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:21,875
It's the real prize.

799
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,880
<i>Since we first discovered</i>
<i>the curse,</i>

800
