2
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:48,647
This story is based on real events.

3
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:52,828
Some of the characters are fictional, and some "scenes" and
dialogues are visualized for creative and dramatic purposes

4
00:00:55,926 --> 00:01:00,084
Where are you going, Aida?

5
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:56,247
Europe - Bosnia - July 1995

6
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:33,209
<i>Srebrenica is transformed into a spacious altar</i>

7
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,706
<i>Every second, three deadly shells land on the town</i>

8
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:41,127
<i>They just brought 17 victims to the hospital</i>

9
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,619
<i>They were accompanied by 57 injured people</i>

10
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:49,398
<i>Does anyone in the world watch
this tragedy taking place in Srebrenica?</i>

11
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,124
<i>... unprecedented crime</i>

12
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:20,162
We are doing everything we can

13
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,758
They have been notified of an official warning

14
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,750
They have until 6 a.m. until they
withdraw all their heavy weapons

15
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:30,681
If they fail to do so, NATO planes
will "attack all their positions."

16
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:33,845
There is nothing more can be done at this time

17
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,421
Always the same

18
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:50,167
You always tell us this, but nothing ever happens

19
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,864
You said this three days ago when
the Serbian army entered the safe zone

20
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,833
And again two days ago when they besieged the town

21
00:04:06,524 --> 00:04:08,935
I said they wouldn't get close to a centimeter

22
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:11,689
However, their tanks are approaching hour after hour

23
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:17,630
Wait a moment!

24
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:24,909
Now go ahead - why has "Srebrenica"
been made a safe international zone!

25
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,869
If the Serbs could enter as they like?

26
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,932
You keep telling us we are safe

27
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:36,217
But they are bombing the city

28
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,360
Their soldiers are in every village around the town

29
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:50,249
As I said, they were notified of an alarm

30
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:53,493
This has dire consequences
if they fail to act

31
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:59,054
Between 40 and 70 aircraft are in gear,
ready to begin the attack

32
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:02,170
On all the sites controlled by the
Bosnian Serb Army of the Republic

33
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:04,337
They will be wiped out

34
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,080
Do people have to move to shelters?

35
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,605
They are safe.  They can stay home

36
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:32,907
What would happen if the planes did not come?

37
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:37,928
Will come.

38
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,170
Will come!

39
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,908
They have been informed of the UN alert

40
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:45,873
If they fail to comply,
they will be attacked at 6 am

41
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:53,553
You will be responsible for what you say

42
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:58,354
Tell him to be responsible for what he says

43
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,698
If the "Serbs" entered the town

44
00:06:01,063 --> 00:06:02,587
Translate

45
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,818
I'm just a pianist

46
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:12,698
What did he say?

47
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:17,135
He said he's just a pianist

48
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:21,522
What?
- It means he's just a messenger.

49
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:27,988
Damn you and your filthy piano!

50
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:29,901
This meeting is over

51
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:34,020
No, it's not over!
- Wait, wait, calm down for a moment.

52
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,353
Thirty thousand lives are in
their hands! Don't be crazy

53
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,305
Faster!

54
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:14,287
Can I borrow your sneakers?
- .Yeah -

55
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,821
Pack this

56
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:55,241
Hurry up. I'm coming.

57
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:18,743
Come on!  Come on!
- Hurry up!

58
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,425
Take them all!

59
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:25,701
Are you the mayor?  - .Yeah -

60
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,923
Take it away

61
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:29,867
From there

62
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:32,162
All of them!  All of them

63
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:46,641
Go upstairs!

64
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,339
Wait!  Please wait

65
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:29,359
Go back!  Wait! Wait

66
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,300
Just go to the main hall

67
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:50,078
Let the wounded turn to the right

68
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:52,246
Let the wounded turn to the right

69
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:56,683
Baho, have you seen my family?
- What?  -

70
00:09:56,826 --> 00:10:01,438
Did you see my family?
- They were right behind us when we left.

71
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:05,938
Where?  In the truck?  I donât
know if they got on this truck.

72
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,065
Where is my son?

73
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,919
What is going on, Aida?
- .I do not know.  I do not know -

74
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:15,231
Well, explain to everyone that we will
set up a hospital in the hall over there

75
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:18,001
Yes, and the operating room will be in the tent

76
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,349
I want all the beds here.  Against the wall

77
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,801
Bring all the medicine you can carry

78
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:33,758
Doctor!  Hey doctor

79
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,957
Aida, what is he saying?

80
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:43,430
There are more wounded people over there
in town, in the basement of the hospital

81
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,613
He told Karimans that there are
more people there. At a hospital in town

82
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:57,024
Doctor.  I don't know where my family is

83
00:10:57,048 --> 00:11:00,169
Can I go check them?
It won't take much time

84
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:03,532
Is other translator
available?  I will search for it.

85
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,628
Okay!  Hurry up.
- Well.

86
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,825
Tariq, have you seen my family?
- .No -

87
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,168
Do you have cigarettes  - what is going on?
-

88
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,627
I do not know.  I have no idea - Listen,
the doctor wants a translator.

89
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,659
I can't, I have to translate at the gate

90
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:37,930
Nermin, have you seen my family?
- No, I didn't see them.

91
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:42,065
Do you have any water?  - No. -

92
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,551
Aida!
- Aida!

93
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,954
Have you seen my family?

94
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:55,059
Yes, we saw the little boy when we got in.
- Where?  -

95
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,091
Aida, what will happen to us?
- I do not know. -

96
00:11:57,957 --> 00:12:01,713
Aida, âMy parents are outside!â
They wouldn't let them in

97
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:04,488
What?
- The Dutch have shut the gate. -

98
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:06,362
What do you mean by that?

99
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:09,695
Mom!

100
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,841
Where are you?  - Mom! -

101
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,992
Where is your brother and father?
- Abroad. -

102
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:25,675
What?  Why?
- I entered, but they stayed behind.

103
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:29,139
What do you mean?
- The Dutch have shut the gate. -

104
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,377
Shut it down?

105
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:33,377
Listen.  Wait for me here.  I will be right back

106
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:43,434
Nihad!

107
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,083
Hamdiya!

108
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:47,489
Aida!

109
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,006
Your family is here!

110
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,735
Where?  - Back there!

111
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:53,148
Why didn't they let us in?

112
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,706
Ahmed, have you seen my family?

113
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:58,730
I am looking for Hamdiya.
We want to go to the jungle

114
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,119
Jungle?
If you see him, tell him to stay here

115
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,697
Maybe I can put you in. The
jungle is a better place than here.

116
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:08,310
Are you crazy?  They cannot touch the United Nations

117
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:10,008
Go towards the gate!

118
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,135
Ah, damn it

119
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,686
Nihad!

120
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,218
Hamdiya!

121
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:48,309
Hamdiya!

122
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:50,241
Aida!

123
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,170
Go to the gate!
- We can't hear you!

124
00:13:53,218 --> 00:13:54,971
Come to the gate!

125
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,821
Meet me at the gate!

126
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,019
From there?

127
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:16,758
Zolfo, what are you saying?

128
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,816
These are my son and my husband - can we come too?
-

129
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:22,466
- Wait,
no.  No one else can be entered -

130
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:25,527
I beg you.  It's my family.
It's not possible.  I'm sorry -

131
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,440
I cannot provide special treatment

132
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:30,003
If I let them in,
everyone else will demand the same

133
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:32,321
What is going on?  Wait here.

134
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,740
- Let's get in. Hey.  Listen -

135
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:37,394
The base is full.  No one can enter

136
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,700
My translation

137
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:43,077
Hear me all.  The base is
full. No one else can enter

138
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:46,308
The base isn't full! There's
a lot of space available

139
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:49,427
Let's get in!  Chetnik's forces are coming

140
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:55,699
What's wrong with
you?  They will kill us all!

141
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:58,610
Where should all these people go?  Where?

142
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,749
Please, Producers.  I beg you

143
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:05,560
Listen, it's bad enough before.  Okay?

144
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:08,318
If I let them in,
everyone will ask to come in

145
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:11,210
Then let them in.
- I have my orders.

146
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,379
Hi to the general

147
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,191
Congratulations, boys.
- Thank you, General.

148
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:39,860
Well done, heroes

149
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:43,074
Is our strength tracking progress?
- Yes, it's sweeping town.

150
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:45,430
It is ours

151
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,358
General!

152
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:51,733
The area has been cleared.
Do not hesitate to take the car

153
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:53,866
There is nothing wrong.  I know that

154
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,449
Let him follow me slowly.

155
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,639
Zelle! Come on, Christch

156
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:03,250
Karla let's go!

157
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:06,953
Capture this science!

158
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:10,651
Take that flag down

159
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:15,103
I don't want it to fly in here.
Get it down.  Bring it down

160
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:17,438
There, then let the photographer shoot that

161
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,670
Watch the neighborhood, boys

162
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,226
Watch the neighborhood.
Enter some buildings

163
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,610
Be careful

164
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:31,188
We are progressing without stopping

165
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,433
Remove that board, Silmanajic Street

166
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,767
Remove it

167
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:41,102
Faster!  Don't make me repeat what I say twice

168
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:44,725
Take it with you.  Don't act like an idiot

169
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,943
Let's go to Potochari!
- Let's say hello!

170
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:54,498
God damn hello!

171
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:57,896
We will keep moving.  You can greet me later

172
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:02,395
We are here in Srebrenica,
Serbia, on the 11th of July 1995

173
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:05,856
On the eve of another great Serbian holiday

174
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:09,517
We present this town as a gift to the Serbian people

175
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:15,262
Did I say the word "Serbs" too often?
- Do not worry.  I will edit it.

176
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:19,910
Did you shoot the background?
- Yes, I took her pictures.

177
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,417
Who the hell is shooting now?

178
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:31,596
Christch, call the United Nations!

179
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,763
If I heard a single bullet,
we would bomb their base! Tell them

180
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:58,347
I have 25,000 people here

181
00:17:58,363 --> 00:18:01,814
No food, no water, and no toilets

182
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:06,547
No!  You listen to me!
Listen to me! We need help

183
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:10,643
What is the logic of giving a warning if it is not fulfilled?

184
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:12,976
I call for air strikes

185
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,511
Yeah!

186
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,622
Yeah.

187
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:28,469
General Mladic is on the line

188
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:41,121
Colonel Karimans?
- You can't go in now.

189
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:44,613
It's urgent!
- Wait, please. I'll call out to you, Aida.

190
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:12,578
Come with me.
-... I need to talk to -

191
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:14,166
I need you now!

192
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:19,698
Major Franken,
my husband and son are near the gate

193
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,277
They don't want to let them
in. Can you get them in?

194
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:24,427
- This is not possible.
Please.  This is my family -

195
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:28,317
Can you imagine if I let your
family in and dismiss all the others?

196
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:30,603
But what if the Serbs reached the base?

197
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,333
How will you keep them safe?

198
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,449
They will not allow us to use the toilets

199
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:42,252
They say we should do it here.
- Aunt, I'm just a translator.

200
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,387
But you have them, please

201
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,641
I really want to go

202
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,373
General Mladic is looking for civilian
representatives from among you

203
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,667
In order to negotiate with him

204
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:05,786
Are there any volunteers?

205
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,584
Someone has to represent you

206
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,647
Is there anyone?

207
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:54,629
They are not here.  They may have fled to the woods

208
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,002
Muharram is there.

209
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,597
He was working as a company director.  Can he go?

210
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:02,770
"Come on," Muharram

211
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,381
"They suggest that someone named him go," Muharram

212
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:07,961
He's a local businessman

213
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,461
I want two more people.  Educated

214
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:22,618
My husband was a school principal

215
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:27,381
If he goes with you,
will you allow my family to enter the base?

216
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:30,442
We cannot let anyone else in

217
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:34,611
He is one of the most
educated people in Srebrenica

218
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:36,724
He speaks German

219
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,911
You won't find anyone who fits best here

220
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,734
Can I have two more actors?

221
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:06,082
Nobody wants to do that

222
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:08,932
Take my husband.  It is the perfect choice

223
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,210
Okay.

224
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:17,825
Find a woman who can join him.
- I'll go.

225
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,754
You stay here. They
don't need our interpreter

226
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:25,484
You can bring your husband after dark.  Else.
What I want from these crowds is for you to riot

227
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay.  I thank you

228
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Yeah.

229
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:35,958
Yes, it will

230
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:48,129
Well who is he?

231
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:51,462
Aida

232
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:56,572
- This is my husband.
move ahead -

233
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,494
And my son - How are they allowed in and not allowed?
-

234
00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:02,641
They have to go negotiate with Mladic - Can Ahmed come?
-

235
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,381
Why are they two?  Who chose them?
- Wait.  She will enter us too -

236
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:09,729
Can "Ahmed" come with us?

237
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:15,825
Calm down!  Calm down

238
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:17,447
The gate!  The gate

239
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,986
I do not understand.  Why do we have to negotiate?

240
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:47,399
Mladic asked for it.

241
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,510
I don't want to go to him

242
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:54,552
To represent all these
people who chose me?

243
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:58,569
Why do not understand?
There was no other way to let you in

244
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:04,328
Why won't you go?

245
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:09,391
You know I'm not the right person.
- They have their own translator.

246
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:12,899
Take control of yourself.  Okay?

247
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:27,035
When are we supposed to go?

248
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:29,376
When Mladic asks you

249
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,281
Seo, what did I tell you about smoking?

250
00:24:33,424 --> 00:24:36,425
Mommy, god!
- Aida, let him do that.

251
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,315
What day is today?
- Who cares for that?  -

252
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:55,696
It's Monday.  No, Tuesday

253
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:57,573
The eleventh of July

254
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,565
eleventh?

255
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,342
My birthday is two days later

256
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:06,065
Congratulations!

257
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:10,835
Not yet!

258
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:16,787
When this is over, we will celebrate every day

259
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:19,851
I'm throwing a big party

260
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:23,328
We'll roast many sheep,
put up a tent, with the music

261
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:26,655
I'll take a thigh to enjoy it for months

262
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,710
Can you lower your voice a little?

263
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:49,615
Aida

264
00:25:50,877 --> 00:25:53,544
Can you manage for them to go without me?

265
00:25:53,743 --> 00:25:55,893
I don't know what to do!
- Nihad!

266
00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:58,234
Daddy, the translator!  O translator

267
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:00,925
I got birth water

268
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:03,814
I got birth water

269
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:06,235
Hey, now?

270
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,341
Breathe, breathe

271
00:26:13,096 --> 00:26:14,889
Okay, pay off.  I pay

272
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:17,897
Breathe with me - Have you ever had a baby?
-

273
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:19,143
Not at all - and you?  -

274
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:21,173
No - We are three.

275
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:28,507
Pay! Why are you out now,
silly thing?

276
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:30,515
Couldn't you have chosen a better time to get out?

277
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:32,015
Come on, push, yeah

278
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,297
Yeah!

279
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:36,680
Here we are.  We're almost done

280
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,148
Comment what?

281
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,926
Where is General Smith?

282
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,212
Okay, can anyone access it?

283
00:26:57,672 --> 00:26:59,418
Then give me someone to represent him

284
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:01,892
Any exit plan?

285
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:05,169
No!  No,
what happened about the air strikes?

286
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:22,314
Where is the Secretary General?

287
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:27,733
No.  No.  Sure, no. You have to
contact me with someone to talk to

288
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,346
Not everyone can be nonexistent

289
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,921
Are you telling me that the entire United
Nations chain of command is on vacation?

290
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,160
So what should I do?

291
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,142
..call

292
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:57,540
Contact our government

293
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,275
What will happen to us?

294
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:24,392
Do you think we are safe here?

295
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,503
I donât know anywhere else
we could be safe if not here

296
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:31,325
This is my thinking

297
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:40,472
What do you want to do when you end the war?

298
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,615
I will go back to teaching at school

299
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:47,590
Be happiest there.  what about you?

300
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,956
I will be drawn to another
war. I will be happier there

301
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,214
Shut up,
this war basically lasted too long

302
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:58,610
Do anything to run away from the kids

303
00:29:01,897 --> 00:29:04,873
Is your family with you here?
- Yeah.  Two sons -

304
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,143
Siou was seventeen.

305
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:14,886
If things were normal, he would have
graduated from high school next year

306
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,211
Hamdiya would be at the university now

307
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,797
All he cares about is his music

308
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:28,035
He joined the group. He
wants to be a pop singer

309
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:31,675
Good Choice.  Something girls love so much

310
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:34,240
After only doctors, of course

311
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:40,789
Yes, but girls are in love with my youngest son

312
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:45,408
I know all mothers,
think their children are special

313
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:47,194
But it really is

314
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:50,623
Hey, there you go, my star

315
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:55,545
Why aren't you trying to get some sleep?
- I will.

316
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:57,034
I'll take care of that

317
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:03,008
Who will translate the negotiations?
- None of us.

318
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,405
Mladic has his own translator

319
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,478
Good, I was so scared

320
00:30:10,526 --> 00:30:12,632
I really don't want to leave of here

321
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,780
Take it

322
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:25,258
Come on, it will make you feel comfortable

323
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:57,715
You live in the clouds, baby âª

324
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:02,488
âª And my voice can't reach you âª

325
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:07,020
You haven't given love to anyone yet âª

326
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,888
Well done, Master

327
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:16,605
You live in white clouds âª

328
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:21,654
Get closer to this song âª

329
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:25,960
I want to share with you âª

330
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:31,105
Those little joys in a dream âª

331
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,501
Those little joys in a dream âª

332
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,989
Closer - Thank you, contestants.

333
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:46,387
The committee will now announce the winner

334
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:49,293
With the best hairdressing in
eastern Bosnia for "season 91/92"

335
00:32:49,577 --> 00:32:51,642
... and the winner of this year's competition is...

336
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:57,654
The Aletsch clique!

337
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:08,007
Give me wine, I want to rest âª

338
00:33:08,373 --> 00:33:11,730
And bring the gypsies to the table âª

339
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:15,765
Let them play .. Let them stir me up âª

340
00:33:16,572 --> 00:33:20,071
Since her eyes did not love me âª

341
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:22,963
Gas!

342
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,067
Hey everyone!  They are firing gas

343
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:29,340
Hey everyone!  They want to suffocate us

344
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:32,690
They want to suffocate
us! They are firing gas

345
00:34:38,797 --> 00:34:42,193
No!  No.  They are firing gas

346
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,459
No, no

347
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:48,974
... they want to... no

348
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:59,732
Get out of the way!  Step aside

349
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:02,135
Get out of the way

350
00:35:02,161 --> 00:35:04,653
Get off the road, please.  I thank you

351
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:09,302
Get out of the way

352
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:11,398
Colonel!

353
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:13,980
Do you think they will let us go?

354
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:16,583
My service should have ended in April

355
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:23,468
My girlfriend is pregnant and may give birth at any time

356
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:29,478
Do you have children, Colonel?
- No. -

357
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:34,018
And you don't have a mistress.

358
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:39,809
Colonel, what happened about the warning?

359
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:44,381
They say we do not have to disturb the Serbs

360
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,570
Everyone's playing goofs

361
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:50,682
While I have to be mindful of this damn monster

362
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:53,635
Beast.

363
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:58,799
I will call him a ghoul, with your permission, Commander

364
00:36:02,288 --> 00:36:03,859
Thank you.

365
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:24,613
Come Quickly!  Quickly

366
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:29,455
Do you have a gun?  Stand there

367
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,435
Are you sure?
- Yes I am sure. -

368
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:40,561
How about the lady?
- I don't have anything.

369
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,236
Women are the most dangerous

370
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,592
Wait here

371
00:37:03,608 --> 00:37:05,306
Excuse me, but we - Shut up!

372
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:01,236
Follow me!

373
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:05,752
General, Mladic

374
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:09,852
The representatives here are the
representatives of the inhabitants of Srebrenica

375
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:13,982
According to Resolution 819,
Srebrenica is a safe area

376
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:15,976
Under the protection of the United Nations

377
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:26,457
Ma'am, what is your profession?

378
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:30,183
An economist. I have two
children and a grandson

379
00:38:30,715 --> 00:38:32,992
With this young man and grandmother since now?

380
00:38:34,518 --> 00:38:38,312
Yes, and I went to school with your classmate here

381
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:43,041
In that case, don't I need to introduce you to each other?
- No need. -

382
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,018
You can solve all problems yourself

383
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:50,979
Did you live in a romantic high school story?
- No.  We were just close friends -

384
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:54,177
We didn't know that things were
going to come to this - but it did.

385
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,762
Actually -... Anila.

386
00:38:57,405 --> 00:38:59,086
- "Beautiful." - "Anila" -

387
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,635
"Beautiful beautiful"?"  -

388
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,269
Did you get involved in politics in Srebrenica?
- No. -

389
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:08,635
I only run an accounting department.
I have not joined any political party

390
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:13,779
And the guy sitting next to you?
I am called Nihad Silmanajic.

391
00:39:13,804 --> 00:39:17,078
I used to work as a principal in
a secondary school in Srebrenica

392
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:18,384
Raise your voice.

393
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,575
My name is Nihad Silmanajic

394
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:24,726
I used to work as a principal in
a secondary school in Srebrenica

395
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:28,917
Basically, I'm a history teacher - are you with any political office?
-

396
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,719
Neither political nor
military. I am a civilian person

397
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,229
I was Muharram Kanovic. I
was a manager of a company

398
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:43,815
I was never involved in any political activities

399
00:39:48,014 --> 00:39:49,616
I want to help you

400
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:54,954
However, since your army has been defeated,
I demand the full cooperation of civilians

401
00:39:56,303 --> 00:39:58,184
There is no need for your people to die

402
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,049
Neither your husbands, nor your brothers, nor your neighbors

403
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:07,361
You can either survive, or perish

404
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,218
Stand to the other side

405
00:40:14,894 --> 00:40:16,718
... for your survival, I ask

406
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:20,284
Of armed men

407
00:40:20,904 --> 00:40:23,046
... even the perpetrators of war crimes

408
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,689
And a lot of them have committed it against us

409
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:28,674
To hand over their weapons to the
"Army of the Bosnian Serb Republic"

410
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:32,531
General

411
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:36,462
Civilian safety is our highest priority

412
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:45,815
What do you want?

413
00:40:46,038 --> 00:40:49,101
We will respect the individual desires of all citizens

414
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:53,989
You can choose to either stay or leave

415
00:40:55,355 --> 00:41:00,805
If you want to leave,
you can just tell us

416
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:07,581
You will provide the fuel,
and I will provide the machinery

417
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,722
I am talking about a large population

418
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,248
.. this is something that must be done

419
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,144
Deal with it

420
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,969
If you choose to leave

421
00:41:20,263 --> 00:41:23,676
And I don't want to pressure you in any way

422
00:41:24,303 --> 00:41:26,738
I have nothing against innocent people

423
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:31,152
General, if you need help from my soldiers,
they are ready to help you

424
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:37,173
Thank you for your offer

425
00:41:38,131 --> 00:41:40,967
... But we don't have fuel,
we don't have fuel

426
00:41:40,992 --> 00:41:43,674
We have not received any supplies since February

427
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:50,170
I'll be refueling

428
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:55,228
You can tell your Ministry of
Defense that your army is safe

429
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,384
Your forces will not be attacked

430
00:42:10,092 --> 00:42:11,203
Historian!

431
00:42:11,624 --> 00:42:14,869
Come on, relax. It would be
better for all of you to leave

432
00:42:18,724 --> 00:42:19,811
General

433
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,932
The United Nations will
provide the escort buses

434
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:26,630
We will create an evacuation plan

435
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:36,409
You draw the plan, and I'll make the transfer

436
00:42:36,568 --> 00:42:39,210
... as a man... and as a general

437
00:42:40,027 --> 00:42:42,604
I guarantee the safety of innocent people

438
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:48,312
Give us some drinks, toast,
and some soda as well

439
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:22,818
Where is your leader?

440
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:25,651
Where is your leader?

441
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:29,148
It's in a meeting with your general

442
00:43:30,537 --> 00:43:32,965
Are there civilians inside?
- Yeah. -

443
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:37,865
How many are there
About four or five thousand.

444
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:41,046
Soldiers?
- There are no soldiers.

445
00:43:41,896 --> 00:43:43,141
There are no soldiers!

446
00:43:43,982 --> 00:43:46,609
He said there were no soldiers, son of a bitch!

447
00:43:47,442 --> 00:43:50,728
I want to come in.
- Our leader is not here.

448
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:53,904
But I'm here!  I want to be there

449
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,072
Okay?  - Wait.  wait -

450
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:07,002
What?  - Look at her. -

451
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:14,418
Come on!  Come on!  Come on

452
00:44:21,357 --> 00:44:22,396
Hi!

453
00:44:22,714 --> 00:44:28,196
We want to see if there are
any Muslim soldiers hiding inside

454
00:44:29,054 --> 00:44:31,113
There are no soldiers.  Just civilians

455
00:44:31,526 --> 00:44:33,216
Nobody asked you to

456
00:44:33,684 --> 00:44:37,592
I want to see with my own eyes

457
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:43,666
Sir.  This is a UN compound.
He cannot enter it as often as I like

458
00:44:43,738 --> 00:44:46,119
Especially not as a
gunman. I am the captain.

459
00:44:46,298 --> 00:44:48,841
Give me the responsible
boy. They don't let us in

460
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,365
<i>Speak in English</i>

461
00:44:57,968 --> 00:44:59,158
Speak in English!

462
00:45:00,428 --> 00:45:03,293
Yes, I will have to speak English

463
00:45:03,563 --> 00:45:08,587
Let them search the base, so they can see for
themselves that there are no Bosnian soldiers

464
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:14,234
Colonel, no armed personnel
is allowed inside the safe zone

465
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,340
He is left alone within our base

466
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:19,593
<i>They just want to check
if there are any soldiers</i>

467
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:24,506
If I let them in with the guns,
people would panic

468
00:45:26,843 --> 00:45:30,216
This is not allowed.

469
00:45:41,429 --> 00:45:43,362
I command you to let them in

470
00:45:43,984 --> 00:45:45,095
<i>Is over.</i>

471
00:45:49,586 --> 00:45:50,657
Thank you.

472
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:58,423
Stay calm!

473
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,786
They are just here to make sure no one is armed

474
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:05,599
Everything is under control

475
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:15,052
Hell! What a pigsty!

476
00:46:15,996 --> 00:46:19,052
There are men here.  I will search them now

477
00:46:44,164 --> 00:46:46,564
What happened to your hand?
- I was chopping wood.

478
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:48,568
Chop wood?

479
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:56,982
Where is your uniform?

480
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,945
We are civilians - civilians?  -

481
00:47:00,248 --> 00:47:04,669
So who have we been fighting for the
past five years, children of prostitutes?

482
00:47:04,725 --> 00:47:05,978
All are civilians

483
00:47:13,736 --> 00:47:15,831
Are there weapons?
- No, there is nothing.

484
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:18,214
nothing?  - I swear to you.

485
00:47:20,326 --> 00:47:21,579
Listen to me

486
00:47:23,262 --> 00:47:26,244
Is there any weapon with anyone?
- No. -

487
00:47:26,515 --> 00:47:29,331
So if there is one shot

488
00:47:30,212 --> 00:47:31,974
.. I confirm only one

489
00:47:32,524 --> 00:47:34,871
That would be your end, okay?

490
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,895
Yes - Louder!

491
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,363
Yeah!

492
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:41,884
Are there weapons?  - No. -

493
00:47:42,218 --> 00:47:43,662
And you?  - No. -

494
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,265
And you?  - No me.. -

495
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:49,234
You are talking to
a Serbian soldier

496
00:47:50,663 --> 00:47:51,877
Come close

497
00:47:55,737 --> 00:47:57,927
Have you killed Serbs?  - No. -

498
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,515
Why?  Are you a coward?

499
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,562
He was not in the army

500
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:06,753
Look at this. Whoever
asked you anything?

501
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:27,179
Little girl!  My little girl

502
00:48:27,203 --> 00:48:29,585
Why is this little girl crying?
- She is hungry. -

503
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,828
Hungry?
Don't you have anything to eat here?

504
00:48:33,091 --> 00:48:34,471
Later?  -

505
00:48:38,408 --> 00:48:42,617
You want them to starve to
death and then blame the Serbs?

506
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,022
Sons of whores!

507
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,299
- Oh, yes!

508
00:48:45,411 --> 00:48:47,426
Bring bread for everyone.

509
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:54,632
I checked the place.
There are no soldiers here

510
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,291
Are you finished?

511
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,858
Leave everything.
Take only the essentials

512
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,703
Only the essentials, can you hear me?
Let's go.

513
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:16,356
Here!

514
00:50:04,692 --> 00:50:08,745
We should have fled to the jungle.
The smart people have already left

515
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:12,715
They will fall directly into the hands of the Chetnik

516
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:15,675
I would die if I stayed here.  I have to run

517
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,470
We can take the weapons of the UN soldiers - what are you saying?
-

518
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:21,532
Never even think about it

519
00:50:21,557 --> 00:50:23,930
Get in here, come on

520
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:26,009
Let's go, now

521
00:50:26,626 --> 00:50:28,084
Right Now!

522
00:50:32,355 --> 00:50:34,315
The crew is only allowed
here. They cannot be here

523
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,466
Serbian soldiers inside the base

524
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:40,808
What?  Franken let them in.

525
00:50:41,268 --> 00:50:45,067
I need to hide them. My husband
went to negotiate with Mladic

526
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:48,568
Civilians are not allowed to
be here - only for a short period.

527
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:53,467
They can stay in that room. This
is the military observers office.

528
00:50:53,492 --> 00:50:57,317
It is not a place for civilians... but the Serbs
are inside the base, with all their weapons -

529
00:50:57,671 --> 00:51:00,660
You don't know they're here.
They won't be disturbing anyone

530
00:51:02,065 --> 00:51:03,541
Peter, please

531
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:09,537
Just for a little while, okay?

532
00:51:09,562 --> 00:51:10,569
Yes - Okay.

533
00:51:10,594 --> 00:51:11,625
Thank you

534
00:51:13,117 --> 00:51:14,727
Okay.  Sit down

535
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,085
Here.  Sit down

536
00:51:19,389 --> 00:51:21,103
Siu, sit here.

537
00:51:27,182 --> 00:51:30,182
Wait here.  I'll be back
soon. I have to get out of here.

538
00:51:30,745 --> 00:51:33,849
What are you talking about, Hamdiya?
We are safe here

539
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,016
What's wrong?  We are safe

540
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:40,079
No, we're not.  They
will kill us. It's not true.

541
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:43,040
They'll kill us.
- Calm, otherwise we'll get kicked out.

542
00:51:43,104 --> 00:51:44,253
They'll kill us all.

543
00:51:44,278 --> 00:51:45,865
They will kill us all

544
00:51:45,929 --> 00:51:48,643
You treat us like fools.
It's always been like this

545
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:51,018
Stop it.
- Never give us the right to say.

546
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:53,491
You sent my father to Mladic!
- Stop it!

547
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:01,150
Aida?

548
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:08,731
Do you need anything?
- Yeah.. -

549
00:52:16,797 --> 00:52:18,011
Take this.

550
00:52:21,313 --> 00:52:22,591
Hamdiya

551
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,208
Everything will be fine, son

552
00:52:29,864 --> 00:52:33,459
Hamdia! âHamdiya, dear.

553
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:37,118
Take care of your brother

554
00:53:29,935 --> 00:53:32,138
Show us the straight path

555
00:53:32,231 --> 00:53:36,116
Way, who bestowed on them

556
00:53:36,157 --> 00:53:39,227
Is not wrath, and who lost

557
00:54:42,307 --> 00:54:43,767
Invite people to a meeting

558
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:52,580
What happened?
- The civilians will be taken to a safe place -

559
00:54:53,127 --> 00:54:55,611
Not to bring them back to "Srebrenica"?
- We can choose to stay.

560
00:54:55,713 --> 00:54:59,473
Stay?  Don't you see that all this was a show?
- Review what?  -

561
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:03,396
He could have killed us if he wanted to,
so why did he meet us?  Why did we talk?

562
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,531
Why did he negotiate with us?  Do you see that what was negotiated?
-

563
00:55:06,722 --> 00:55:11,822
He planned it a long time ago. We
negotiated the issue of peopleâs safety.

564
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:16,973
I can't stand this stupid woman!

565
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:15,185
Hold on!  Slow down

566
00:56:17,598 --> 00:56:19,065
Don't panic

567
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,023
You will be transferred to Cladani

568
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:25,745
Women and children must leave first

569
00:56:27,452 --> 00:56:30,811
Just don't panic,
let the little kids! And the women go first

570
00:56:32,884 --> 00:56:34,977
We don't want any child to be lost

571
00:56:36,114 --> 00:56:38,532
Do not worry.  No one will harm you

572
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:41,023
Thank you, General

573
00:56:42,635 --> 00:56:44,301
What is your name?
- "Jasmine." -

574
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:47,483
Take.  This is for you.  I'll put it here

575
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,637
Can we have some?  Please -

576
00:57:04,643 --> 00:57:06,293
Leave my cow alone!

577
00:57:07,064 --> 00:57:10,079
It's all of my life!
- The cow is in good hands!

578
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:23,719
Quickly!  Quickly

579
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:26,211
Guys out there

580
00:57:26,894 --> 00:57:30,171
But she's my wife!
- We want to interrogate you first.

581
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,750
And make sure you didn't kill the Serbs!
- Leave him alone!

582
00:57:33,593 --> 00:57:35,546
Zolfo!  Zolfo

583
00:57:37,986 --> 00:57:40,541
Quietly!  We don't load potatoes

584
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:41,660
Shut up!

585
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:50,169
Come on, let's go

586
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:51,955
Faster!

587
00:57:57,146 --> 00:57:58,431
Your hands up

588
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:01,026
Come on!  Hurry up

589
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:08,797
General!

590
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,948
General Mladic!

591
00:58:11,115 --> 00:58:13,860
The agreement was that the
buses... would be escorted by us

592
00:58:14,152 --> 00:58:17,430
And that everyone can choose.
If he wants to stay or leave

593
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:20,303
We haven't even completed an evacuation plan yet

594
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,323
Where is the plan?

595
00:58:32,157 --> 00:58:34,223
We were not given any opportunity to equip one

596
00:58:36,158 --> 00:58:38,689
Is this my problem?

597
00:58:38,936 --> 00:58:42,277
We haven't even registered them yet,
where are the buses going?

598
00:58:44,532 --> 00:58:47,649
You can set an escort for all buses

599
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:49,435
Nobody is stopping you from that

600
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,292
Put some of your men on each edge

601
00:58:52,317 --> 00:58:53,872
... But the deal was

602
00:59:17,402 --> 00:59:19,291
Men go there!
- No!

603
00:59:20,331 --> 00:59:21,529
Mom!

604
00:59:22,188 --> 00:59:25,530
Leave him!  Bring
my son back to me!

605
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:40,524
The soldiers saw nine bodies behind the base.
- What?

606
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,306
They are interrogating the men and killing
them, two hundred meters from the base

607
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:47,060
How did you know that?  I
heard someone say Karimans

608
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:50,719
Is Karimans here?  - No. -

609
00:59:51,227 --> 00:59:52,893
Where is he?  - I do not know. -

610
01:00:11,104 --> 01:00:12,837
Colonel Karimans!

611
01:00:16,543 --> 01:00:17,834
Colonel Karimans!

612
01:00:17,895 --> 01:00:19,561
<i>"Go and meet Major Franken!"</i>

613
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,705
No, we have to talk to you

614
01:00:25,046 --> 01:00:27,044
They are killing people outside

615
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,688
Open the door!

616
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,260
<i>No... Franken is who</i>

617
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:34,798
You have to do something

618
01:00:36,155 --> 01:00:38,083
Colonel Karimans
- <i> Leave me alone.</i>

619
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:41,368
Open the door!

620
01:00:43,344 --> 01:00:44,415
... open

621
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:49,630
Does anyone know what's going on here?

622
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,638
Have you called the United Nations in New York?

623
01:00:52,726 --> 01:00:55,363
Don't make it more complicated than it is

624
01:00:55,848 --> 01:00:57,633
I am trying to do what I can

625
01:00:57,657 --> 01:01:01,814
You promised us that the Serbs would not enter the town

626
01:01:01,957 --> 01:01:04,839
..You will protect us.
- I don't promise anything.

627
01:01:05,418 --> 01:01:08,779
I am doing my best.  Srebrenica
a "safe international zone" -

628
01:01:08,804 --> 01:01:11,279
And your mission is to protect the people

629
01:01:15,734 --> 01:01:18,004
Where do they take them?  Does anyone know?

630
01:01:20,194 --> 01:01:23,575
My men have received orders to control the position of the buses

631
01:01:24,225 --> 01:01:27,073
I do everything according to the authority available to me

632
01:01:27,605 --> 01:01:30,700
Now please leave.
I have work to do

633
01:01:31,486 --> 01:01:35,613
Instead of spreading rumors,
get busy with your own business

634
01:01:36,188 --> 01:01:38,589
What did he say?  Translate

635
01:02:17,089 --> 01:02:19,088
We will leave with the Dutch

636
01:02:20,715 --> 01:02:24,010
Keep an eye on
Hamdiya. He's really scared

637
01:02:28,084 --> 01:02:30,171
I am the worst cowards

638
01:02:30,322 --> 01:02:31,925
This is nonsense.

639
01:02:34,444 --> 01:02:38,263
You survived in three and a half years
of war, and you will survive this as well

640
01:02:39,279 --> 01:02:41,041
Let's just hold on to each other

641
01:03:58,886 --> 01:04:01,996
You Muslim girls of prostitutes!

642
01:04:03,834 --> 01:04:05,040
Whores!

643
01:04:20,317 --> 01:04:23,356
You teacher, come here for a moment

644
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:28,994
Do not worry.  We're not going to hurt you.
- No, thanks.  I'm all right here -

645
01:04:29,374 --> 01:04:32,032
My teacher was in high school.
- Yes -

646
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:34,018
Be kind

647
01:04:35,017 --> 01:04:36,368
Where is Hamdiya?

648
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:39,802
He's not here, he's gone to the jungle

649
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:44,571
How's your mom doing, Billy?
- .It's okay -

650
01:04:45,008 --> 01:04:47,743
Send her my peace.
- Your peace is worth, Master.

651
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:51,163
Send my greetings to your children, especially the little "Hamdiya"

652
01:04:55,286 --> 01:04:57,278
See you later, heroine

653
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:01,063
Attention Please!

654
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:05,775
The evacuation of civilians outside the base has been completed

655
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:08,371
They will be taken to Cladani

656
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:12,633
Which is under the control of
the Bosnian army. They are safe

657
01:05:13,396 --> 01:05:14,967
It's your turn now

658
01:05:15,181 --> 01:05:19,118
You can start departing in
groups of five to get on the buses

659
01:05:34,071 --> 01:05:37,880
Who gave the orders?
Why can't we return to Srebrenica?

660
01:05:43,215 --> 01:05:45,914
Begin leaving the base in an orderly manner!

661
01:05:45,986 --> 01:05:49,815
In groups of five people - this is not safe.  Who will go with us?
-

662
01:05:49,898 --> 01:05:51,850
Tell them.  In groups of five people

663
01:05:53,001 --> 01:05:56,323
Aida,
translate everything I have said

664
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:00,403
Translate

665
01:06:04,674 --> 01:06:07,864
The evacuation of refugees abroad has been completed

666
01:06:09,262 --> 01:06:11,277
Now, it's your turn

667
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:15,909
You can start leaving
the base in groups of five

668
01:06:16,593 --> 01:06:19,060
Alhamdulillah, that is over

669
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:18,271
Hamdiya?

670
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,224
Hamdiya?

671
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:24,091
What?  - What's wrong?  -

672
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:25,313
No.

673
01:07:25,512 --> 01:07:27,003
My head - your head?  -

674
01:07:28,805 --> 01:07:31,339
Will it benefit you if I hit you?

675
01:07:32,885 --> 01:07:35,916
Take all sharp things out of
your pockets and your bags

676
01:07:38,723 --> 01:07:40,421
Throw it into these containers

677
01:07:44,302 --> 01:07:46,596
..Without any circumstance

678
01:07:46,667 --> 01:07:49,730
Possess sharp tools

679
01:07:54,186 --> 01:07:55,511
Anything sharp

680
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:57,805
Scissors.  Pens.  Pencils

681
01:08:16,878 --> 01:08:20,852
What are you doing?
- Perhaps they hold a grudge for someone in the pictures.

682
01:08:24,222 --> 01:08:27,730
Does dad have to get rid of his notebook?
- Where is he?  -

683
01:08:29,024 --> 01:08:30,992
Should it be destroyed as well?
- Give it to me. -

684
01:08:33,826 --> 01:08:36,022
It contains a summary of each day of the war

685
01:08:36,047 --> 01:08:39,642
Three and a half years of life!
- Nihad!

686
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:05,001
Aida?

687
01:09:05,287 --> 01:09:07,469
What?
- What is your ID number? -

688
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:10,779
I can't hear you - what's your UN card number?
-

689
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:12,826
421 Why?

690
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,457
What do you do?  - List. -

691
01:09:17,624 --> 01:09:21,084
They are unable to read our names,
so they just asked me to write it down

692
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:22,745
Whose names?

693
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:25,848
Those who will leave the
base in the Dutch convoy

694
01:09:25,889 --> 01:09:27,928
You're on the list - and my family?
-

695
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:31,599
No - what do you
mean?  Add them to it -

696
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:34,503
Come on.
- Ask him first.

697
01:09:35,491 --> 01:09:39,733
Peter, please add my family
to the list - UN staff only -

698
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:44,489
The Serbs don't know who works with the United
Nations. They want to see your identification cards.

699
01:09:44,664 --> 01:09:47,108
We'll make cards for them.
I don't have a machine here.

700
01:09:47,148 --> 01:09:48,838
Who owns it?  - I do not know. -

701
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,672
I think Akbar's is making it

702
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,061
- Grow up.
- Yes.

703
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,917
"Hamdiya," "Saad," and "Nihad."

704
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:22,316
Is "Akbarz" here?
- No.  There to the left -

705
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:28,077
Grow up?  - Yeah?  -

706
01:10:28,102 --> 01:10:29,491
Where is the machine?

707
01:10:29,649 --> 01:10:31,760
Which machine?
- That makes identification cards -

708
01:10:32,332 --> 01:10:34,976
Is this the machine?
- No.  It's that -

709
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,681
It's broken

710
01:10:43,747 --> 01:10:45,310
I told you it was down

711
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:56,118
Listen!  He crossed them off the list

712
01:10:57,675 --> 01:10:58,833
Look

713
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:01,780
I couldn't do anything

714
01:11:07,692 --> 01:11:08,794
Aida!

715
01:11:10,254 --> 01:11:11,350
You can't go in. It's urgent.

716
01:11:11,384 --> 01:11:12,899
There is a meeting!
- It's urgent!

717
01:11:14,122 --> 01:11:18,454
Why did you drop my family from the list?
- You can't break into a meeting.

718
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:20,995
- Get out!
- Please put my family on the list.

719
01:11:21,088 --> 01:11:23,334
We are dealing with thousands of lives now

720
01:11:23,398 --> 01:11:27,588
If I add their names, I endanger the
safety of everyone who has UN cards

721
01:11:29,366 --> 01:11:31,855
Do you want to put other
people's lives at risk?

722
01:11:39,568 --> 01:11:42,266
Frankin,
I beg you. Don't send them out there

723
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,552
Take.  You can delete my name

724
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:48,210
Aida, I'll check myself if your
sons are safely leaving here

725
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,634
Now, please, let's continue our work

726
01:11:52,706 --> 01:11:55,348
Would you put them on the list?
- I will do my best. -

727
01:13:05,489 --> 01:13:07,709
Push them in!  Let's go

728
01:13:11,341 --> 01:13:12,380
Come on!

729
01:13:45,251 --> 01:13:48,687
All unauthorized persons
must now leave the UN base

730
01:13:48,981 --> 01:13:50,409
We're on the list

731
01:13:51,147 --> 01:13:53,399
What are the names?
- "Silmanajic."  "Saad" and "Hamdiya" -

732
01:13:53,424 --> 01:13:55,423
And âNihadâ and
âAida.â - âSilmanavicâ -

733
01:13:55,448 --> 01:13:57,058
Silmanajic.

734
01:14:02,223 --> 01:14:04,485
Only your name is on the list, so they have to leave

735
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:07,238
No.  No.  Please check it again

736
01:14:08,692 --> 01:14:09,692
Yeah.

737
01:14:09,897 --> 01:14:12,214
I'm sorry, we have to clear the base

738
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,627
This is something.
- They will not leave.

739
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:19,554
What..?

740
01:14:19,776 --> 01:14:21,863
Please don't force me - Use it!

741
01:14:21,975 --> 01:14:25,087
What difference does it
make if the Serbs or you kill us?

742
01:14:25,683 --> 01:14:29,086
Franken told me they'd be on the list!
- Okay, but they're not on the list!

743
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:32,523
So the list is wrong.
- Franken gave me this list.

744
01:14:32,638 --> 01:14:34,293
I was just with him

745
01:14:35,776 --> 01:14:39,894
Your list is not updated. We
will stay. Ask Major Franken

746
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:43,362
They are not on this list - Didn't you hear what I said?
-

747
01:14:43,371 --> 01:14:45,029
- Well, you!
- Stop it!  De Haan, help me.

748
01:14:46,461 --> 01:14:47,732
We're on the list

749
01:14:47,954 --> 01:14:49,906
Well,
check it out again! We're on the list.

750
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:52,144
We are on the list

751
01:14:58,203 --> 01:14:59,695
Stay here.  Do not move

752
01:15:05,832 --> 01:15:08,269
Neighbors!
- Hey, Mitar.

753
01:15:08,626 --> 01:15:11,189
Honey, you are going from
that direction. You come with me

754
01:15:11,214 --> 01:15:13,692
Where will he go?
- He will follow you directly.

755
01:15:13,788 --> 01:15:17,184
I beg you!  Please don't take it!
- Leave me alone!

756
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:20,563
- Let's go! Mitar,
please! Don't do that!

757
01:15:38,385 --> 01:15:39,496
"Basim"!

758
01:15:40,163 --> 01:15:41,234
"Basim"!

759
01:15:41,314 --> 01:15:44,170
Bassem,
can you take my sons outside the base?

760
01:15:45,139 --> 01:15:48,066
Please - they'll kill
them if they find them.

761
01:15:48,575 --> 01:15:50,130
And they'll kill me too

762
01:15:51,011 --> 01:15:53,212
Try to hide them in one of these trucks

763
01:16:06,917 --> 01:16:08,193
.I'm sorry

764
01:16:10,328 --> 01:16:12,550
They can hide under boxes

765
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,629
If the Serbs find them,
then we will at least try

766
01:16:18,836 --> 01:16:22,969
There's no place for that cargo to
fill cars completely, don't you know?

767
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:34,401
Doctor!  I want you to take my sons with you

768
01:16:34,473 --> 01:16:36,552
What?  I want you to
take my sons with you.

769
01:16:36,616 --> 01:16:38,488
Maybe I accidentally caused them trouble

770
01:16:39,912 --> 01:16:42,141
Three trucks of the wounded have left

771
01:16:42,261 --> 01:16:44,101
No one has arrived at the hospital

772
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:46,562
And I have a very bad feeling about it

773
01:16:56,724 --> 01:16:58,303
They just took them

774
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:13,616
Come here

775
01:17:15,545 --> 01:17:17,934
I'll take them to meet Karimans

776
01:17:19,553 --> 01:17:21,823
Aida, please take it with you.

777
01:17:22,228 --> 01:17:23,299
I beg you!

778
01:17:29,793 --> 01:17:30,864
Here!

779
01:17:33,478 --> 01:17:36,545
Come on!  Down there
- They can see us here.

780
01:17:53,339 --> 01:17:55,362
I will come back to you

781
01:17:56,529 --> 01:17:57,798
Enter.

782
01:18:00,433 --> 01:18:03,639
The man is to the left,
the woman is to the right!

783
01:18:05,687 --> 01:18:06,766
Come on!  Come on

784
01:18:09,623 --> 01:18:10,972
Give me this

785
01:18:14,068 --> 01:18:15,750
Hurry up, people

786
01:18:22,962 --> 01:18:25,502
You are!  There is a man!

787
01:18:26,236 --> 01:18:27,378
No!  No

788
01:18:27,426 --> 01:18:29,693
No Please.  Don't
take it. It's just a kid

789
01:18:30,529 --> 01:18:32,378
What the hell are you doing?

790
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:35,395
Who ordered you to do that?

791
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:40,881
Samer! Take my son back to
me! Where are you taking him?

792
01:18:55,384 --> 01:18:57,947
This is an independent TV channel from Belgrade

793
01:18:58,050 --> 01:18:59,962
Can you tell us what's going on?

794
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,295
You know what is happening. You
know very well what is happening

795
01:19:10,639 --> 01:19:11,924
Good evening!

796
01:19:12,599 --> 01:19:14,583
How are you?  - Fine. -

797
01:19:16,155 --> 01:19:19,119
How is your trip?  Good.

798
01:19:22,103 --> 01:19:23,405
Good evening!

799
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:26,076
Do you feel hot?

800
01:19:29,307 --> 01:19:30,807
Do you know who I am?

801
01:19:31,085 --> 01:19:33,147
- It's General Mladic.
- Shut up, you!

802
01:19:33,814 --> 01:19:35,798
Get rid of your cigarette

803
01:19:36,473 --> 01:19:39,212
You heard about me, and now you can see me

804
01:19:40,316 --> 01:19:42,723
You have heard accounts of me, but they are not true

805
01:19:42,827 --> 01:19:43,938
Fabrications

806
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,152
I am here to protect you

807
01:19:47,025 --> 01:19:48,533
Their pictures are not me

808
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:53,073
You will be transported safely to Kladani!

809
01:19:53,802 --> 01:19:56,476
I guarantee your life, and I forgive everything

810
01:19:57,157 --> 01:19:59,559
I hope, but a good trip.
- Thank you.

811
01:20:00,493 --> 01:20:02,691
I apologize that it came to this point

812
01:20:03,295 --> 01:20:06,874
But you have to blame some -
the people among you, not me

813
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:11,325
Good luck,
and let's not fight anymore

814
01:20:12,818 --> 01:20:15,619
Good luck children!
Live your life in peace

815
01:20:23,058 --> 01:20:24,947
Leave my son alone!

816
01:20:31,184 --> 01:20:32,683
Let me go

817
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:44,218
Aida!

818
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:46,940
Mom!

819
01:20:49,075 --> 01:20:50,590
What are you doing?

820
01:20:51,066 --> 01:20:52,725
Leave my children alone

821
01:20:53,051 --> 01:20:54,828
Leave my children alone

822
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,844
Aida!
- Leave my children alone!

823
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,532
Calm down!  - Relax!
- Leave my children alone!

824
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:01,215
Calm down!  Calm down

825
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:04,489
Aida, tell your husband he can stay.

826
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:07,592
They can survive?
- No.  Just your husband.

827
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,108
I have written down his name as the official refugee representative

828
01:21:12,624 --> 01:21:15,338
His business meeting in the negotiations - And our two sons?
-

829
01:21:16,275 --> 01:21:17,715
This is not possible.

830
01:21:19,725 --> 01:21:21,335
Why is it not possible?

831
01:21:22,733 --> 01:21:23,844
Why?

832
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:25,941
We abide by the rules here

833
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:28,857
So, it is up to him to
decide. He can stay or leave

834
01:21:33,475 --> 01:21:35,792
Please take my children for me

835
01:21:38,007 --> 01:21:41,063
I clarified well here.
They are not on the list

836
01:21:41,453 --> 01:21:42,508
I beg you.

837
01:21:44,109 --> 01:21:46,339
Put at least one of us on the list

838
01:21:51,858 --> 01:21:54,555
I beg you.  Put at least one of them on the list

839
01:21:55,096 --> 01:21:56,167
I beg you.

840
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:59,734
At least put one of them on the list

841
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,377
I beg you.

842
01:22:02,576 --> 01:22:04,925
You are asking me to do the impossible

843
01:22:05,744 --> 01:22:08,577
Aida - They are taking
them to Kladaney - Franken.

844
01:22:08,641 --> 01:22:12,907
They will be completely safe. Frankin,
please don't send my kids away.

845
01:22:13,589 --> 01:22:16,819
Franken, I beg you! Franken,
I beg you

846
01:22:16,939 --> 01:22:20,144
- Let them stay.
- That's all I can do.

847
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:22,572
Franken, let them stay. I
beg you -... all I can do -

848
01:22:22,597 --> 01:22:25,652
Please Franken, let them stay!
- Stop begging!

849
01:22:26,518 --> 01:22:27,700
Franken!

850
01:22:29,252 --> 01:22:32,506
- I'm coming with you!
You can and must stay.

851
01:22:32,569 --> 01:22:35,030
Do not worry.
I'll be with them.

852
01:22:35,054 --> 01:22:37,940
I'll go with you!
- Everything will be fine.  do not worry -

853
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,123
- Everything will be fine.
- I'll go with you!

854
01:22:42,377 --> 01:22:43,964
I'll go with them

855
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:46,083
Stay here!

856
01:22:46,262 --> 01:22:47,898
Don't go there!
- Leave me alone!

857
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,130
Don't go there

858
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:52,033
Do not do!  They are my children

859
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:54,478
Master, you can't go there

860
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:57,819
Go back to base or else
they put you on another bus

861
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:00,128
Leave them alone

862
01:23:00,962 --> 01:23:02,223
"See you!"

863
01:23:03,894 --> 01:23:04,973
Hamdiya!

864
01:23:05,235 --> 01:23:07,368
Where will they take them?
- I do not know. -

865
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:09,817
Don't do

866
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:13,261
Don't do

867
01:23:13,968 --> 01:23:15,269
Don't do

868
01:23:46,428 --> 01:23:48,658
Throw in your personal documents here!

869
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:50,563
Your hands are above your heads!

870
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:11,242
Now you will see the real movie

871
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,869
What are you staring at?

872
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:20,502
The real movie is about to start

873
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,248
Come on!

874
01:24:23,796 --> 01:24:24,859
Come on!

875
01:28:14,033 --> 01:28:16,327
Yeah?  - Good evening. -

876
01:28:18,936 --> 01:28:21,197
I am called Aida Selmanagic

877
01:28:25,118 --> 01:28:26,277
Go ahead

878
01:28:34,305 --> 01:28:36,084
You don't have to take off your shoes

879
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:44,871
Get in

880
01:28:49,257 --> 01:28:50,732
Do you want coffee?

881
01:29:23,909 --> 01:29:25,552
Please

882
01:29:26,782 --> 01:29:30,434
I just made some cakes
for the kids. If you like some

883
01:29:52,457 --> 01:29:56,115
... taste the cake... it's
still a little hot, however

884
01:29:56,329 --> 01:29:59,829
Did you happen to find some of our pictures?

885
01:30:00,504 --> 01:30:01,511
It happened

886
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,583
And I kept it.  It's under the sofa

887
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:34,055
These are your possessions

888
01:30:34,603 --> 01:30:36,063
... or what's left of it

889
01:30:37,501 --> 01:30:38,842
Thank you.

890
01:30:48,061 --> 01:30:50,965
Nobody has asked about this apartment in years

891
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:54,441
So we assumed that the owners were dead

892
01:31:05,298 --> 01:31:08,448
They told us you'd come
back to teach at school?

893
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:14,121
Yes.
- Our son is in first grade.

894
01:31:15,543 --> 01:31:16,629
Nicola!

895
01:31:17,011 --> 01:31:18,300
Nicola!

896
01:31:20,444 --> 01:31:22,872
Come.  Say hello, son

897
01:31:22,912 --> 01:31:24,070
Hi!

898
01:31:36,233 --> 01:31:39,407
... I couldn't find the body of my two sons

899
01:31:39,582 --> 01:31:40,946
Not my husband

900
01:31:43,098 --> 01:31:45,856
Nobody tells us where they are buried

901
01:32:02,569 --> 01:32:05,671
Please get from here as soon as you can

902
01:32:08,181 --> 01:32:12,101
I'm not sure this is a good idea - not good for you, you mean?
-

903
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:16,590
The neighborhood is insecure.
- I have nothing left to lose.

904
01:32:30,772 --> 01:32:33,192
Happy blessing.

905
01:32:49,079 --> 01:32:53,825
Come.  Take this who's
waiting for me at the door?

906
01:35:41,231 --> 01:35:42,540
..brouwn

907
01:36:10,588 --> 01:36:11,835
Mom!

908
01:39:27,345 --> 01:39:35,254
For the women in "Srebrenica", and the 8372 slain of
their .. children, husbands, brothers, relatives, and neighbors

909
01:39:38,153 --> 01:39:41,153
Film by Jasmila Zbanic
