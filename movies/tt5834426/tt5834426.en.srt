160
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:22,903
Honey, I sell T-shirts
and toys.

161
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,806
I can patch you through
to customer service.

162
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,873
<i>Please hold.</i>

163
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:47,428
Hello?

164
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,382
Black, two sugar.

165
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,984
Oh, you read my mind.
Thank you.

166
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:11,119
What are you doing up
so early?

167
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,488
I could ask you the same.

168
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:15,189
Is everything okay?

169
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:16,991
Will be.
So I'm gonna be home by dinner.

170
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:19,093
If I'm not,
make sure Jimmy does his homework,

171
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:22,063
- has a bath...
- You worry too much.

172
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:23,998
I've got everything
under control.

173
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:26,167
Right. Talk soon.

174
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,456
Okay, don't everybody
speak at once.

175
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:51,327
The Moon's orbit
has shifted.

176
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,262
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,598
Its orbital radius
is decreasing.

178
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,966
Well, that's not possible.

179
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,501
We thought the same,

180
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:02,137
so we ran the numbers
and triple-checked our data.

181
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,039
So, the Moon's been
orbiting around the Earth

182
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:05,441
for billions of years,

183
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,009
and now you're telling me
it's changed its course?

184
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:11,213
This isn't kindergarten,
speak.

185
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:14,016
Right, uh, yes.
So, on its last orbit,

186
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,219
our Lunar Reconnaissance Probe
picked up something strange.

187
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:18,655
What is that?

188
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,022
We don't know.

189
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,457
We have
photometric measurements

190
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,225
of gaseous spectra
being emitted from inside.

191
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:27,297
Where is this?

192
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:29,866
Mare Crisium.

193
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:33,903
<i>How many times
do I have to tell you?</i>

194
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:35,572
I need to speak
to Deputy Director Fowler

195
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,374
immediately.

196
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,409
But this is urgent.

197
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,311
I understand how
a restraining order works,

198
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,046
but if you people at NASA
won't listen to me,

199
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,247
how am I supposed to...

200
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,281
Hello?

201
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:52,422
What would Elon do?

202
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:01,531
Oh, Fuzz Aldrin.

203
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:04,167
How many times have I told you
to use the litter box?

204
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,438
Oh, God.

205
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,681
"Astronaut Day."
This is today.

206
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:20,951
Fuzz, you're a damn genius!

207
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:27,626
Extra back scratches later.

208
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,041
Our teacher said you're
a washed up no-show.

209
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,310
She's complaining to someone.

210
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:49,180
You really don't look
like an astronaut.

211
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:52,717
Well, are you going to
teach us about space or what?

212
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:54,985
Brian!

213
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,988
Brian!

214
00:14:00,492 --> 00:14:03,696
Open the goddamn door.
You're three months late!

215
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,198
Shit.

216
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:07,700
I can hear you in there.

217
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:13,371
- Oh, shit. Oof!
- Brian!

218
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:23,448
<i>To put it bluntly,
the Moon is a megastructure.</i>

219
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:27,385
Do you get it?
Huge and artificial!

220
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,721
Whoever built
this incredible thing

221
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:31,289
must think
we're a pathetic species.

222
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:33,525
But don't even get me
started on eclipses.

223
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:35,193
They're only possible
because the Moon

224
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:38,463
is exactly 400 times smaller
than the Sun,

225
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:41,500
and exactly 400 times
closer to the Earth.

226
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:45,370
Anyone know how that happened?

227
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:48,074
Uh... 'Cause the Moon's
a megastructure?

228
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:50,109
Yeah, someone's
paying attention!

229
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:57,483
Let me tell you kids
something.

230
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,820
When Apollo 12 dropped
their empty fuel tank,

231
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:02,789
the impact made the Moon
ring like a bell.

232
00:15:02,823 --> 00:15:05,358
Bong!

233
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:09,495
It rang for hours.
And do you know why?

234
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:13,499
Because the damn Moon
is hollow.

235
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:17,704
Put that in your pipe
and smoke it.

236
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:23,543
Hello. I'm Brian Harper.

237
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:26,212
I'm supposed to be
speaking here today.

238
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:28,314
Oh!

239
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:30,851
I'm Dr. KC Houseman,
megastructurist.

240
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:32,184
It's a real honor.

241
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:33,352
I'm sorry, who are you?

242
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:35,222
Um...

243
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,524
I've made
a shocking discovery.

244
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:40,862
I need you to get me in
touch with NASA immediately.

245
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:43,597
Well, NASA and I aren't really
on speaking terms these days.

246
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:46,199
Well, that will change...

247
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,535
when you tell them that
the Moon is out of orbit.

248
00:15:49,771 --> 00:15:50,772
Really?

249
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:55,576
Hey, kids, I'm gonna
go get this all sorted out.

250
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:56,644
Be right back.

251
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:58,412
Look at the data.

252
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:00,447
A natural body does not
change its orbit overnight.

253
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,249
Yeah, well, my natural body

254
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:04,151
is walking away
from you right now.

255
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:06,353
There must be something wrong
with the Moon's power source.

256
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:08,856
- Yeah, that must be it.
- I knew you'd believe me.

257
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,659
People usually think
I'm some kind of crackpot.

258
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:14,127
Hey, fellas, I need this guy
escorted off the premises

259
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:15,362
for impersonating me

260
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,764
and creeping out
a bunch of school kids.

261
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,498
I was not
impersonating you.

262
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:20,300
Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to come with us.

263
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:21,803
Sorry, man.
I got enough on my plate without

264
00:16:21,836 --> 00:16:23,639
some crazy guy thinking
the Moon's out of orbit.

265
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:25,340
- I'm not crazy!
- Okay.

266
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:26,407
Read this.

267
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,344
All right, I'm on my way.

268
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:35,751
Oh. Hi.

269
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,947
Is this a butt dial?

270
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,815
Put on channel 16.

271
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,416
<i>Well, I thought
we weren't speaking anymore.</i>

272
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:10,686
Are you watching?

273
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,354
<i>The two suspects
who have rolled through</i>

274
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:14,289
<i>at least two red lights...</i>

275
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:17,894
Okay, looks like some idiot
tried to outrun the cops.

276
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:21,397
Yeah. That idiot is your son.

277
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,666
Sonny doesn't even have a car.

278
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,199
I'm still fixing up
the Mustang.

279
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,970
Tom gave him one
for his birthday.

280
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:29,806
<i>The car has stopped.
It's an expensive sports car.</i>

281
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,741
<i>Two young men that appear
to be in their 20s.</i>

282
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:34,443
Oh, my God.
Are you seeing this?

283
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:36,378
<i>LAPD have them in custody.</i>

284
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:38,213
<i>Out for a joy ride</i>

285
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:39,548
<i>and this day is not going
to end well for them.</i>

286
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:40,884
<i>There you have it.</i>

287
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,852
<i>Another high-speed
car chase...</i>

288
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,910
Next case,
Sonny Neil Harper.

289
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:15,853
It says here
you just turned 18.

290
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,487
Unfortunately,
that makes you an adult

291
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,889
in the eyes of the law.

292
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:21,558
What? Hey, aren't you
gonna say something?

293
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:24,394
Because of the reckless nature
of your actions

294
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:27,564
and the amount
of illegal substances

295
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:29,332
present at the time
of your arrest...

296
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:30,901
No, Your Honor.
Those drugs weren't his.

297
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,636
They were just his buddy's.
They were on their way

298
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,038
- to a concert.
- Quiet in my court.

299
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,438
Well, he just got scared.
That's why he took off.

300
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:37,007
All right, that's it.
Bailiff.

301
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,876
Your Honor, excuse the actions
of my client's father.

302
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,577
We're prepared to pay

303
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,646
whatever the bail is
right now.

304
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,280
Money's no object.

305
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:46,349
Well, I guess that makes
the defendant a flight risk.

306
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:47,585
Your Honor, we do not mean

307
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,286
to offend the court
in any way.

308
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,522
I'm postponing this
bail hearing till next week.

309
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:53,992
Bailiff, remove Mr. Harper.

310
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:55,827
Wait. You can't...
Don't listen to him.

311
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:57,394
You can't put him in jail
for a week.

312
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,830
Please, I'm begging you.

313
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:00,297
Sonny, I'm gonna get you out.

314
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,335
<i>If you're looking
for the deal of your life,</i>

315
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:06,337
<i>come to Tom Lopez Lexus,</i>

316
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,706
<i>where you're not
just a customer,</i>

317
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:09,507
<i>we treat you like family.</i>

318
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,943
Do you have any idea
how a courtroom operates?

319
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:13,444
Your lawyer was doing nothing.

320
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:15,013
<i>Oh, so you know better
than my lawyer</i>

321
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:17,048
who's on a $50,000 retainer!

322
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:19,450
I thought money
was no object, Tom.

323
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:21,385
Oh, no, no, no.
It is when you don't have any.

324
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,054
<i>Nice move, by the way.
Sonny's now a flight risk.</i>

325
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,455
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

326
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:25,824
This guy's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

327
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,059
All right, everyone,
just cool it.

328
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,061
- <i>Now, what the hell happened?</i>
- <i>Oh, what happened?</i>

329
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,529
<i>When Brian had to open
his big mouth,</i>

330
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:32,596
<i>he had a little speech.</i>

331
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:33,865
Oh, my God. Go to hell, Tom.

332
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:34,934
<i>Yeah, you know what?</i>

333
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,434
<i>And you go to outer space,</i>

334
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,837
- <i>far away from us.</i>
- <i>Guys!</i>

335
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,705
We're all just trying
to help Sonny right here.

336
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:41,606
Oh, wait, Brian's trying
to help Sonny? Since when?

337
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,475
<i>Brenda, honestly, what do you
see in this schmuck?</i>

338
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:45,745
Oh, you're a big man,
aren't you?

339
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,814
<i>How did this happen?
Why wasn't he at USC?</i>

340
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:49,749
He moved out when you
got him that new apartment.

341
00:19:49,782 --> 00:19:51,050
<i>So ask him.</i>

342
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,785
He barely returns
my calls anymore.

343
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:53,986
<i>Welcome to the club.</i>

344
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,037
Oh, KC, is that you?

345
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,873
Hey, Mum.
<i>Rosmarinus officinalis.</i>

346
00:20:13,906 --> 00:20:16,108
A few studies have found
that smelling rosemary

347
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:18,110
can improve
your short-term memory.

348
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:21,113
Oh, that's lovely, dear.
Thank you.

349
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:22,347
Thank you.

350
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:26,352
Oh, no, no, no, Mum.
Let me do that.

351
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:32,092
There we go.
So, how are you feeling?

352
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,392
Great.

353
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:34,962
But enough about me.

354
00:20:34,995 --> 00:20:36,529
Everybody here knows

355
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:39,933
that my son is a genius
working at NASA.

356
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,668
What?

357
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:44,570
I'm a nobody, Mum.

358
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:46,572
Well, you're somebody to me.

359
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:48,141
I actually did make
a discovery.

360
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:49,442
But it doesn't matter.

361
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:53,146
No one will listen to me.

362
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,413
Then make them.

363
00:20:58,685 --> 00:20:59,820
Make them listen?

364
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,825
Oh, hello.

365
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,727
Are you new here?

366
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:08,996
No, Mum.

367
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:12,133
It's me. It's KC.

368
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,533
Your son.

369
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:18,106
Can someone tell me
what the hell I'm looking at?

370
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,540
The Moon has entered
an elliptical orbit.

371
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:21,943
Meaning?

372
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:23,778
It'll circle
around us three times

373
00:21:23,811 --> 00:21:25,479
before it reaches
the Roche Limit

374
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:27,614
at 17,000 kilometers.

375
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:30,885
At that point, city-sized
pieces of Moon debris

376
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,921
will rain down on us.

377
00:21:32,954 --> 00:21:34,488
So we have three months?

378
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:35,757
Not exactly.

379
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,491
As the Moon
moves closer to us,

380
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:39,060
our months
will begin to shorten.

381
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:43,131
We've estimated a timeline
of roughly three weeks.

382
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:44,933
Maybe less than that.

383
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:47,035
We have some new high-res
scans that just came in.

384
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,905
Jesus Christ.

385
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:52,941
Is that a hole
in the crater floor?

386
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:54,943
So what are our options here?

387
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:56,610
We have to go back
to the Moon.

388
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:58,112
We have to see
what's going on up there.

389
00:21:58,146 --> 00:21:59,648
How do we carry crew?

390
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,183
I've already talked
to my contacts in Europe.

391
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,919
We can potentially
get a STC-62

392
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:05,054
en route by tomorrow.

393
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:06,188
Potentially?

394
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:07,856
Great.

395
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,894
I'll just brief the president
on a maybe.

396
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:14,029
In the meantime, everyone
keep your mouths shut.

397
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,497
Um...

398
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,202
That might be a problem.

399
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:24,139
It's, uh, trending on Twitter
as of two minutes ago.

400
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:25,774
It's your ex-husband.

401
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:27,676
Thank you.

402
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,279
Hey, Doug, I'm a little busy
right now. What is it?

403
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:31,880
<i>Is it true?</i>

404
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:33,182
Tell me there's been
some kind of mistake.

405
00:22:33,215 --> 00:22:34,615
<i>I wish I could,</i>

406
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,819
but the math
actually checks out.

407
00:22:36,852 --> 00:22:38,253
<i>So, it's happening.</i>

408
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:39,955
How's Jimmy?

409
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:42,257
Well, you'd know if you
saw him once in a while.

410
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,694
Please don't start.
I call him all the time.

411
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:48,497
Sorry, I gotta run.

412
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:50,599
Oh...

413
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,702
- Your Honor.
- Jesus Christ!

414
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:54,070
I guess hanging up
wasn't clear enough.

415
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:55,571
I just need two minutes
of your time.

416
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:57,741
You have
till I reach the door.

417
00:22:57,774 --> 00:22:59,976
I got a classic bike
and my son's vintage Mustang

418
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,277
that I can use as collateral

419
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:02,912
till I get money,
whatever you need.

420
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:05,682
Are you trying to bribe me?
In a courthouse?

421
00:23:05,715 --> 00:23:07,017
I just wanna get my son back.

422
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,184
The courts are closed.

423
00:23:08,218 --> 00:23:09,719
Will they reopen Monday?

424
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,087
Not likely.

425
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:12,655
What's that supposed to mean?

426
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,057
Look, I'm just trying
to get the heck outta here

427
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,925
before the traffic
becomes a nightmare.

428

Can we talk?

560
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:38,154
How did you know I was here?

561
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:40,423
Your website.

562
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:43,059
You read my blog?

563
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,161
You knew all this was
happening before anyone.

564
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:47,931
Before NASA. How?

565
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:49,265
Why bother?

566
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,067
You're just gonna say
I'm crazy again.

567
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:53,002
Try me.

568
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:55,605
Well, for years I've been
studying distant planets,

569
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,941
searching for one of
these orbiting megastructures.

570
00:28:57,974 --> 00:28:59,609
But I never could
have imagined

571
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:01,077
there'd be one right here,

572
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:03,079
in our own backyard.

573
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,448
Ever heard of a Dyson sphere?

574
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:07,951
Yeah.

575
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:09,452
Every megastructure
has a rigid shell

576
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,155
built around a power core.

577
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:13,224
Most likely
a captured white dwarf

578
00:29:13,257 --> 00:29:14,992
that's being harnessed
for energy.

579
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:18,162
Something obviously happened
to the one inside our Moon

580
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:20,531
and that's why
it's veering off course.

581
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,101
Yeah, still crazy.

582
00:29:27,004 --> 00:29:28,239
Why did you come here

583
00:29:28,272 --> 00:29:29,273
if you're not going
to believe me?

584
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:30,408
'Cause I know what it's like

at 25.6 kilometers.

590
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,728
Still holding.

591
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:52,396
- It stopped?
- It's coming back.

592

00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,399
And it knew we were coming.

638
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:44,834
So it was probably drawn out

639
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:47,369
by the electronic signature
of the capsule.

640
00:33:47,403 --> 00:33:48,705
Everything
we thought we knew

641
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:50,372
about the nature
of the universe

642
00:33:50,406 --> 00:33:53,208
has just
gone out the window.

643
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:58,314
We're not prepared for this.

644
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:04,689
Deb, don't argue, just pack
your stuff. We're leaving.

645
00:34:06,623 --> 00:34:07,825
So you're just gonna quit?

646
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:09,359
What do you want me to do?

647
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:10,761
I want you to help us
figure out what

648
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:12,295
the hell this thing is,
so we can beat it.

649
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:13,596
We're not equipped for that.

650
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,766
You've seen
what we're up against.

651
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,935
You've been gunning for my job
for a while, Fowler.

652
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:20,303
Congrats, it's yours.

653
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:21,604
What are you not telling me?

654
00:34:21,638 --> 00:34:23,339
You've got Q clearance.

655
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:25,442
The hole is
in the Mare Crisium.

656
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:28,012
That's what the Harper
hearings were all about.

657
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:31,481
If you're serious about going
down the NASA rabbit hole,

658
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:33,718
you should pay a visit
to Holdenfield.

659
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:35,886
Here's your clearance.

660
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:15,026
<i>How did you
get down here?</i>

661
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,828
<i>Hutchings
gave me this.</i>

662
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:19,731
<i>I'll need all records
of STX-136A.</i>

663
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,743
You waiting for something?

664
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:46,025
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

665
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,631
<i>I feel it.</i>

666
00:35:57,904 --> 00:35:59,005
What are you doing?

667
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:02,875
Holdenfield?

668
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:07,046
You're not supposed
to have that, 136 Alpha.

669
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,449
That's classified. Top secret.

670
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,585
Why is NASA
lying about all this?

671
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,923
July 20th, 1969.

672
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:18,958
"One small step for man,

673
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:21,727
"one giant leap for..."
yada, yada, yada.

674
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:23,964
In school,
you were taught that Apollo 11

675
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:26,532
lost contact
with Mission Control

676
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:29,635
for two minutes. Not true.

677
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,073
Mission Control
cut their feed to the world

678
00:36:33,106 --> 00:36:35,976
because they found something
on that day.

679
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:38,846
Strange pulsating lights

680
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:42,515
emanating from beneath
the Moon's crust.

681
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:47,154
It was me who was assigned
to keep it under wraps.

682
00:36:47,187 --> 00:36:50,657
The Apollo crew played ball.
Everybody after.

683
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,826
Just Brian Harper wouldn't.

684
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,095
They called him crazy.

685
00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:56,596
Threw him out with the trash.

686
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:58,932
You're telling me
that the Moon

687
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,535
was effectively the biggest
cover-up in human history?

688
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:07,107
Biggest? Probably.

689
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,477
You had blood
on your hands, too.

690
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,413
Yeah, well,
anyone who follows orders

691
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:16,550
pretty much always does,
don't they?

692
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:20,154
That technology,
it's light years ahead of us.

693
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:23,658
Compared to that,
we're the Stone Age.

694
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:29,097
The only shot we had
to stop it

695
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,598
was Zulu X-Ray 7.

696
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:34,468
It was shut down. Shelved.

697
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:37,005
For budgetary reasons.

698
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:39,707
Well, Commander,
I have pressing business

699
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:42,409
waiting for me on my desk.

700
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:45,713
The sand in the hourglass

701
00:37:45,747 --> 00:37:48,515
is dropping quickly
for all of us.

702
00:37:48,548 --> 00:37:50,818
It's as good as gone.

703
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,687
I'm really sorry.

704
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,023
Really.

705
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:09,004
Damn it.

706
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,540
What's wrong?

707
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:13,976
I can't reach my son.

708
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:15,110
Uh...

709
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:17,913
Word is, um,
you're an astronaut,

710
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:20,683
so you must know that

711
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,986
the entire inside
of the Moon

712
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:26,188
is full of produce.

713
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,923
KC, can you tell
Birkenstocks here

714
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:30,125
that I'm dangerously close
to hurling him out a window?

715
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,861
Okay, well,
let's find an empty room.

716
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,964
How do you think
the Incas got their potatoes?

717
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,166
Sorry.

718
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,968
You said that if we can
destroy this thing...

719
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:40,970
<i>We have a theory</i>

720
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:43,604
<i>that the Moon might return
to its original orbit.</i>

721
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:46,843
And how do you propose
we do that exactly?

722
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:48,144
You said so yourself,

723
00:38:48,178 --> 00:38:51,181
using a modern spacecraft
is not feasible.

724
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:53,016
<i>I am working on a solution.</i>

725
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:54,550
We appreciate your effort,

726
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,219
but this is now
a military operation.

727
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:58,221
We'll take it from here.

728
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:03,693
<i>Doug! Wait!</i>

729
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:05,862
<i>If you launch nukes,</i>

730
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:08,530
<i>the global fallout
is gonna kill everybody.</i>

731
00:39:08,564 --> 00:39:10,066
Who said anything about nukes?

732
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,669
<i>You are making
a big mistake here.</i>

733
00:39:12,702 --> 00:39:14,671
<i>Please,
let me put together a plan.</i>

734
00:39:14,704 --> 00:39:16,172
We have a plan.

735
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:23,880
Look, why don't you and Jimmy
come with me to Colorado?

736
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:25,647
You'll be safe there.

737
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:28,584
<i>What are you asking me to do?
Quit? Give up?</i>

738
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,954
I'm asking you
to think about our son.

739
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:34,825
<i>I am thinking about our son.</i>

740
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,267
Where is he?

741
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:45,736
Uh, jail.

742
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:49,840
He's a good kid,
just made a mistake.

743
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:52,810
I was always
doing stupid things.

744
00:39:52,843 --> 00:39:55,046
Don't know how my parents
put up with me.

745
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,814
We never had a lot of money,

746
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:58,983
but sometimes
we'd all get fish 'n chips,

747
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:00,151
sit out on the dock

748
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:03,020
and just watch the stars
for hours.

749
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:06,991
That was when I first dreamed
of being an astronaut.

750
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:12,663
After my father passed,

751
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:16,233
my mum wanted to move
back to the States.

752
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:19,804
My dad laughed when I told him
I wanted to be an astronaut.

753
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,604
Didn't believe in you?

754
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:23,842
Oh, that's putting it lightly.

755
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,945
I worked my ass off
to get into NASA.

756
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:28,947
I read all about
your last mission.

757
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,916
You saw alien tech.

758
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:33,051
And NASA insisted
it was a meteor.

759
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:35,253
But it wasn't?

760
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:37,722
It was unlike anything
I'd ever seen.

761
00:40:37,756 --> 00:40:39,024
And, you know,
the worst part

762
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:42,894
is I lost a friend up there.

763
00:40:42,928 --> 00:40:44,162
And it was my fault.

764
00:40:44,196 --> 00:40:45,864
Oh, come on.
How was it your fault?

765
00:40:45,897 --> 00:40:48,400
You saved the shuttle.
You saved Fowler.

766
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:49,901
A lot of good that did.

767
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:52,204
I'm divorced, broke,
my son hates me.

768
00:40:52,237 --> 00:40:54,206
God, I am so jealous.

769
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,209
Alien tech.

770
00:40:57,242 --> 00:40:58,376
It's freakin' awesome.

771

00:41:19,198 --> 00:41:21,767
are you sure they're going
to let me into the bunker?

779
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:23,703
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

797
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,408
I love you, sweetheart.

798
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,378
<i>Hey, Doug.</i>

799
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,247
What is a ZX-7?

800
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:08,782
<i>Who told you about that?</i>

801
00:42:08,815 --> 00:42:10,350
<i>Well, come on.
What is it?</i>

802
00:42:10,384 --> 00:42:15,389
Zulu X-Ray Seven
was a prototype EMP device.

803
00:42:15,422 --> 00:42:17,191
But the program got disbanded.

804
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:20,294
Okay, well, it's clear that
this thing inside the Moon

805
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:22,229
is technological
in nature, right?

806
00:42:22,262 --> 00:42:24,498
<i>I assume they thought an EMP
could take the thing out.</i>

807
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:27,334
We don't have a way into space
so this is a moot point.

808
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:29,770
<i>Okay, well, how far along
was the testing?</i>

809
00:42:31,772 --> 00:42:34,241
Jocinda, NASA isn't cleared
for another mission.

810
00:42:34,274 --> 00:42:36,210
How about you let me
worry about that?

811
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:43,083
<i>GPS is locked on LZ.</i>

812
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:45,954
<i>Compensate latitude
by minus 4.5 west.</i>

813
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:48,389
<i>4.5 degrees. Copy.</i>

814
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:50,124
<i>Reducing to 10 knots.</i>

815
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,172
Open the door.

816
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,242
Yeah?

817
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:09,244
- Brian Harper?
- Yeah.

818
00:43:09,277 --> 00:43:10,545
We need you to come with us.

819
00:43:10,578 --> 00:43:12,513
It's a matter
of national security.

820
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:14,816
All right.
Give me a second.

821
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:16,317
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

822
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,186
Yeah, we're a team.

823
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:24,459
Oh.
Sorry, I'm sorry, miss.

824
00:43:26,494 --> 00:43:27,495
Sorry.

825
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:33,268
Oh, sorry, sorry.

826
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:39,108
It's been nearly three hours.
That can't be a good sign.

827
00:43:40,976 --> 00:43:42,211
What's with
all the pill popping?

828
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,245
You're really sweating
over there.

829
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:45,481
- You okay?
- Yeah.

830
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:52,821
No. I broke into UC Irvine
multiple times.

831
00:43:52,855 --> 00:43:54,156
I lost two of their mops.

832
00:43:56,558 --> 00:43:58,093
They probably know.

833
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,999
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me. No.

834
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:05,601
Look, I don't want to be here
any more than you do.

835
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:07,336
Sit down.

836
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:09,405
No, no, no. I don't have to
take orders from you anymore.

837
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,607
I'm just curious, you still
screwing over your friends?

838
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,342
- Oh, you talking about me?
- How many of these

839
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:14,576
- wonderful people here...
- Really?

840
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,878
Guys!

841
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:20,482
Who the hell is this?

842
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:25,255
Dr. KC Houseman, ma'am.

843
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,925
I wrote you several e-mails,
but you never responded.

844
00:44:32,162 --> 00:44:33,530
What's this all about?

845
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,432
Follow me.

846
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,137
What you're about to see,

847
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:43,139
only a handful of people
have ever seen before.

848
00:44:43,173 --> 00:44:44,407
KC knew the Moon
was out of orbit

849
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:45,975
before you guys did.

850
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:50,113
Social media went wild
when I posted my research.

851
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,548
You're the
"unidentified source"?

852
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:52,849
Oh, yes.

853
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:54,918
Oh, God.

854
00:44:57,253 --> 00:45:00,056
Mosley, pull up
the tunnel, please.

855
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:04,294
Our readings
estimate its depth

856
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,496
to be over 25 kilometers.

857
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:07,597
That's the Mare Crisium.

858
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,132
Exactly.

859
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:11,068
I think whatever happened
all those years ago

860
00:45:11,102 --> 00:45:12,169
is directly responsible

861
00:45:12,203 --> 00:45:13,304
for what's happening
right now.

862
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:15,039
Oh, so you believe me now?

863
00:45:15,072 --> 00:45:16,540
I saw your helmet cam.

864
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:18,275
It's a little late
for an apology.

865
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:20,411
We were both lied to.

866
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:23,080
The international mission
didn't just go sideways.

867
00:45:23,114 --> 00:45:24,382
It was attacked.

868
00:45:24,415 --> 00:45:27,251
A technological life form.

869
00:45:27,284 --> 00:45:28,986
No effin' way.

870
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:30,654
During the attack,
the Moon was attempting

871
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,356
to return
to its original orbit,

872
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:35,559
until this thing
went back inside the Moon.

873
00:45:35,593 --> 00:45:38,529
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

874
00:45:38,562 --> 00:45:40,699
It's doing something to the
megastructure's power core.

875
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:42,166
Excuse me.
The megastructure?

876
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:43,567
Please don't ask.

877
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:46,337
It's highly likely our
Moon was built by aliens.

878
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,572
We have to get inside
and make first contact.

879
00:45:48,606 --> 00:45:49,640
I told you not to ask.

880
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:51,175
All right, look,

881
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:52,977
we're planning a mission
to attack this thing.

882
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,311
The only problem is,

883
00:45:54,345 --> 00:45:56,614
is it recognizes
our technology.

884
00:45:57,582 --> 00:46:01,186
Which is why we need you.

885
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:03,922
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that again.

886
00:46:04,623 --> 00:46:06,091
You're the only pilot

887
00:46:06,124 --> 00:46:07,392
to ever land a shuttle
without power.

888
00:46:07,426 --> 00:46:09,494
Not exactly a hirable skill.

889
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:11,129
Well, it is right now,

890
00:46:11,163 --> 00:46:14,566
which is why I'm offering
you your job back,

891
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:18,937
and I'm personally
asking you for your help.

892
00:46:20,305 --> 00:46:21,640
Say yes, Brian.

893
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,048
I don't know.

894
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:32,284
I got a lot of my own
problems down here.

895
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:35,587
And the Moon
falling onto Earth

896
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,690
isn't one of them?

897
00:46:37,723 --> 00:46:41,092
I was wrong to bring you here.
I am done.

898
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:42,762
How do you plan
on getting up there?

899
00:46:42,795 --> 00:46:46,032
You know all of our shuttles
are in museums.

900
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:47,701
The <i>Endeavour</i>
is right here in L.A.

901
00:46:47,734 --> 00:46:51,204
Plus, the Chinese are offering
their prototype moon lander.

902
00:46:51,237 --> 00:46:53,105
I know it sounds
completely crazy.

903
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:55,041
No, no,
what you showed us was crazy.

904
00:46:55,074 --> 00:46:58,044
This is a whole other
level of insane.

905
00:46:58,077 --> 00:47:00,146
Ought to be right up
your alley then, no?

906
00:47:02,148 --> 00:47:03,149
If I do this,

907
00:47:05,084 --> 00:47:07,220
I'm gonna need
something in return.

908
00:47:10,323 --> 00:47:12,492
Clear!
All clear over here.

909
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:14,460
Staircase on your left.

910
00:47:14,494 --> 00:47:15,762
Keep your eyes open.

911
00:47:18,197 --> 00:47:19,632
Did you reach him?

912
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:22,568
Yeah. It's being handled.

913
00:47:22,602 --> 00:47:24,771
Sonny's gonna meet us
at Vandenberg.

914
00:47:24,805 --> 00:47:27,073
Looks like
we missed the party.

915
00:47:27,106 --> 00:47:28,508
I didn't even
get an invite.

916
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,713
At least somebody's
on the same page as us.

917
00:47:37,785 --> 00:47:40,688
Hey, hey. Look what I found!

918
00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:42,523
Maybe we can use it
as toilet paper.

919
00:47:42,556 --> 00:47:44,826
- What?
- Take a look around you, man.

920
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:47,394
- It's worthless.
- Whatever. Let's go.

921

What's weird?

940
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:43,117
The Moon doesn't have
enough gravity to do that,

941
00:48:43,151 --> 00:48:44,687
no matter how close it gets.

942
00:48:45,688 --> 00:48:47,322
You still don't get it.

943
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:49,490
We're dealing
with a megastructure.

944

Your rules
don't apply anymore.

We've been here

and nobody's bothered
to paint over that?

947
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,400
It's kinda growing on me.

948
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:01,569
Hey, where's Sonny?

949
00:49:01,603 --> 00:49:02,905
I sent a ground crew
to the prison, okay?

950
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:04,807
But I haven't heard anything
in a few days.

951

Why the hell
didn't you say that?

952
00:49:06,374 --> 00:49:07,609
'Cause I need you
to be focused

00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:15,785
without an exhaust system.

956
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,553
The Moon has an engine?

957
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,790
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

958
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,862
Well, at least your husband
came through with that.

959
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:27,529
Ex-husband.

960
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:40,777
- Colonel.
- Director Fowler.

961
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,712
Commander Harper.
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Reed.

962
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,580
This is Captain Avery.

963
00:49:44,613 --> 00:49:46,415
We've been briefed
by General Davidson.

964
00:49:46,448 --> 00:49:48,617
We need to walk you
through the arming procedure.

965
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:50,552
I'm an astronaut,
not a soldier.

966
00:49:50,586 --> 00:49:51,821
I'll get you
where you need to go,

967
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,188
but I'm not setting off
any bomb.

968
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:54,490
We don't expect you to.

969
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:55,959
We'll accompany you
on the mission

970
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,594
and activate the device,

971
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:58,829
but you need to be familiar
with the process

972
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:00,397
should complications arise.

973
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:05,635
The bomb's security
and authentication systems

974
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,804
have been removed.

975
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,238
Meaning we can arm it

976
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,539
without approval
from the ground.

977
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:11,574
Using a remote trigger.

978
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:14,644
Two clicks,
then push this down and hold.

979
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,179
Triggers the device to go off.

980
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,717
- Simple.
- Yeah. Simple.

981
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,223
Nearing Vandenberg, Captain.
Over.

982
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,458
Roger that.

983
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:35,265
Should've gotten you
the jumbo platter.

984
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,600
Thank you for getting me out.

985
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:38,769
You can thank your dad.

986
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:45,443
Plan is to take off

987
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:47,311
when the Moon
is closest to Earth.

988
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,547
Now, since we're dealing
with an unpredictable target,

989
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,515
navigation
is gonna be crucial.

990
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,318
Our navigator, Carl Saunders,

991
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,021
is gonna be making sure
we hit the mark,

992
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:57,455
flight engineer Hannah Martin

993
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:59,457
will run
real-time calculations

994
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,993
to ensure
that we intercept the Moon.

995
00:51:02,027 --> 00:51:03,494
And once
we clear the atmosphere,

996
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,262
we'll begin
the refueling process.

997
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:07,398
Thankfully
our friends at SpaceX

998
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,901
have a propellant depot
currently in orbit.

999
00:51:09,935 --> 00:51:11,402
I love Elon.

1000
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,407
So once
we're all powered off,

1001
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,342
we'll use our thrusters
to position ourselves

1002
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,745
over the Mare Crisium.

1003
00:51:19,778 --> 00:51:21,278
Our Chinese friends

1004
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:22,881
have jerry-rigged
the onboard systems

1005
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:25,583
so that we can fly it
without electronics.

1006
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:27,585
So we'll park the rover
section of the module

1007
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,353
with the bomb inside,

1008
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,957
then switch the electronics
back on

1009
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,425
and use it as bait

1010
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:35,895
to lure this thing
out of its hole.

1011
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:38,563
Then, you guys
will pull the trigger

1012
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:40,700
and kill it.

1013
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:45,637
And then, hopefully,
we all can go back home.

1014
00:51:45,671 --> 00:51:47,472
If we still have one left.

1015
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:51,409
What did I say?

1016
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:54,080
Sonny. Oh, my God, son.

1017
00:51:54,113 --> 00:51:55,748
- Thank God you're okay.
- Thank you.

1018
00:51:57,415 --> 00:51:58,684
- Hold on.
- Okay.

1019
00:51:58,718 --> 00:51:59,986
Just so I'm clear,

1020
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:01,854
you're gonna take
a bomb into space.

1021
00:52:01,888 --> 00:52:05,323
And why are you even here?
You hate NASA.

1022
00:52:05,357 --> 00:52:07,026
Just try to understand.
If there's even

1023
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:08,694
the smallest chance
that this could work...

1024
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:12,430
- What if it doesn't?
- It has to.

1025
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:14,901
I want you to have a world
you can grow up in.

1026
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:17,469
Where you can be
a better man than me.

1027
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:22,042
Hey.

1028
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:26,412
What have you seen
since you've been there?

1029
00:52:26,445 --> 00:52:28,548
<i>The space shuttle and stuff.</i>

1030
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:29,883
Do you miss me?

1031
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,919
Yeah, I really miss you.

1032
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:34,087
I miss you too, my little man.

1033
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:35,521
<i>Is Mom around?</i>

1034
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:40,526
Mom, it's Dad.

1035
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,869
Wow, he's getting good.

1036
00:52:49,502 --> 00:52:50,704
Yeah?

1037
00:52:50,737 --> 00:52:53,674
I held up my end
of the bargain.

1038
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:55,575
<i>I want you and Jimmy
in Colorado.</i>

1039
00:52:55,608 --> 00:52:57,811
We are. We're gonna be
airlifted out of here

1040
00:52:57,845 --> 00:52:59,847
<i>as soon
as the shuttle launches.</i>

1041
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,414
Look, if anyone finds out

1042
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:03,583
- what I've done for you...
- <i>They won't.</i>

1043
00:53:03,616 --> 00:53:06,687
You just make sure
your trigger-happy buddies

1044
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,554
keep their hands
off the nukes.

1045
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,862
Sorry, guys.

1046
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:16,030
Out of two percent.
I looked everywhere.

1047
00:53:16,064 --> 00:53:18,665
Nah, this is great.
Thanks, man.

1048
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,935
You know,
I almost got a job at NASA.

1049
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,603
What department?

1050
00:53:22,636 --> 00:53:23,637
Janitorial.

1051
00:53:34,648 --> 00:53:35,750
Get out!

1052
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:39,020
Hang on!

1053
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:55,069
Is this your current
projected lunar orbit?

1054
00:53:55,103 --> 00:53:56,603
- Yeah.
- Why?

1055
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:57,773
This obviously
isn't accounting

1056
00:53:57,806 --> 00:53:59,909
for the Moon's increased mass.

1057
00:53:59,942 --> 00:54:01,476
Look at
all this seismic activity

1058
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:03,712
in the wake of its orbit.

1059
00:54:03,746 --> 00:54:05,848
We know
the Moon's surface gravity

1060
00:54:05,881 --> 00:54:07,917
is 1.62 meters squared.

1061
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,417
At least it used to be.

1062
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:12,755
So this must be wrong.

1063
00:54:18,794 --> 00:54:19,929
I'm sorry, Director Fowler,

1064
00:54:19,962 --> 00:54:21,230
we have a problem.

1065
00:54:21,263 --> 00:54:22,998
Just what we need,
a damn earthquake.

1066
00:54:23,032 --> 00:54:24,632
We're losing coolant.

1067
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:26,168
Well, there has to be
a way to fix it.

1068
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:28,170
Not here. We would need
the entire team at Michoud

1069
00:54:28,203 --> 00:54:29,637
to rebuild
something like this.

1070
00:54:29,672 --> 00:54:30,906
Well, then get on the horn

1071
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,473
and find somebody
who can help us.

1072
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:35,010
Anyone that can help us
is already here.

1073
00:54:41,616 --> 00:54:42,818
Look,

1074
00:54:42,851 --> 00:54:44,552
we have to think about

1075
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:46,723
letting all
of these people here

1076
00:54:46,756 --> 00:54:47,924
get to safety.

1077
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:49,558
To safety?

1078
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:51,527
These people here
won't have a planet

1079
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,495
unless we figure
something out.

1080
00:54:53,529 --> 00:54:55,631
Brian, we're down an engine.

1081
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:59,002
Launching is no longer
an option.

1082
00:54:59,035 --> 00:55:00,804
Thanks for bringing me here.

1083
00:55:08,211 --> 00:55:09,611
<i>May I have
everyone's attention.</i>

1084
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:15,885
<i>You've all done more
than we ever could have asked.</i>

1085
00:55:15,919 --> 00:55:18,788
<i>You have my deepest thanks</i>

1086
00:55:18,822 --> 00:55:21,958
<i>along with the thanks
of the entire country.</i>

1087
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:24,761
<i>But it's now time
for you to go home.</i>

1088
00:55:24,794 --> 00:55:27,563
<i>I'm ordering
the immediate evacuation</i>

1089
00:55:27,596 --> 00:55:29,899
<i>of all personnel
from Vandenberg.</i>

1090
00:55:29,933 --> 00:55:33,004
<i>You'll meet up with
your families in Colorado.</i>

1091
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:36,073
Dad.

1092
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,508
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

1093
00:55:39,744 --> 00:55:41,145
Story of my life.

1094
00:55:42,913 --> 00:55:44,982
Thanks for getting me
out of jail.

1095
00:55:47,785 --> 00:55:49,619
Let's get our stuff.
It's time to go.

1096
00:55:58,195 --> 00:55:59,629
Time's up.

1097
00:55:59,662 --> 00:56:01,298
Chopper's ready.
Come on. Let's go.

1098
00:56:07,304 --> 00:56:08,839
Go ahead.
I'll meet you out there.

1099
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:10,107
Why are you guys still here?

1100
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:12,642
Director Fowler,
when it comes back around,

1101
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:15,246
the Moon's gravity will be
over 80% of the Earth's pull.

1102
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:16,714
I know how it sounds,

1103
00:56:16,747 --> 00:56:17,915
but we checked
Dr. Houseman's data.

1104
00:56:17,948 --> 00:56:19,250
The numbers are solid.

1105
00:56:19,283 --> 00:56:20,986
Show the director
our new simulations.

1106
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:22,687
We have to pull up
our launch window.

1107
00:56:22,721 --> 00:56:25,257
Guys, where have
you been? Look.

1108
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,927
There is no launch window.

1109
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,796
The mission's over.

1110
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,038
Wait. Wait a minute.

1111
00:56:53,718 --> 00:56:55,020
How do you feel
about flying the shuttle

1112
00:56:55,053 --> 00:56:56,721
with only two engines?

1113
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:58,390
It can't be done.

1114
00:56:58,423 --> 00:57:00,058
If we launch when the Moon
is directly above us,

1115
00:57:00,092 --> 00:57:01,726
the increased
gravitational pull

1116
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,328
should give
the shuttle a boost,

1117
00:57:03,361 --> 00:57:04,830
giving you a really good
chance of getting into orbit.

1118
00:57:04,863 --> 00:57:06,898
You evacuated
my entire flight crew.

1119
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:09,068
I can't fly the shuttle alone.

1120
00:57:09,102 --> 00:57:10,837
That's why I'm
going with you.

1121
00:57:13,172 --> 00:57:14,841
My guys will stay back
and handle the launch.

1122
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:17,043
But we've got a very narrow
window of time here.

1123
00:57:17,076 --> 00:57:19,779
You'd have to be ready to go
in exactly 28 minutes.

1124
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,181
You fly and I'll navigate.

1125
00:57:22,215 --> 00:57:24,684
Just like old times.

1126
00:57:24,717 --> 00:57:26,719
- What do you say?
- What about the EMP device?

1127
00:57:26,752 --> 00:57:27,987
It's still in the Moon Lander.

1128
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,288
I mean, we lost the crew

1129
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:30,323
so we're gonna have
to set it off ourselves,

1130
00:57:30,356 --> 00:57:33,059
but you paid attention, right?

1131
00:57:33,092 --> 00:57:36,062
Two clicks, then press
the button down and hold.

1132
00:57:36,095 --> 00:57:39,065
Triggers the device
to go off. Simple.

1133
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:42,201
You figured all this out?

1134
00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:45,171
And he calculated
our new launch trajectory.

1135
00:57:45,204 --> 00:57:46,973
You know, without electronics,

1136
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,274
we're gonna need to make

1137
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:50,810
split-second calculations
up there.

1138
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:53,012
Plus, we lost
our flight engineer.

1139
00:57:53,045 --> 00:57:54,046
Mm.

1140
00:57:56,249 --> 00:57:58,418
No. No, no, no, guys.

1141
00:57:59,419 --> 00:58:00,921
I'm not cleared for this.

1142
00:58:00,954 --> 00:58:03,190
Well, I'm the
acting director of NASA,

1143
00:58:03,223 --> 00:58:05,792
so I just cleared you.
Congrats.

1144
00:58:05,826 --> 00:58:07,027
Yeah, but...

1145
00:58:10,297 --> 00:58:11,765
I've got IBS.

1146
00:58:12,933 --> 00:58:15,002
Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

1147
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:17,104
- Mm.
- I get motion sickness, too.

1148
00:58:17,137 --> 00:58:19,139
You said you always wanted
to be an astronaut.

1149
00:58:21,308 --> 00:58:23,944
I have debilitating anxiety.

1150
00:58:23,977 --> 00:58:26,914
KC, if the Moon really
is what you think it is,

1151
00:58:26,947 --> 00:58:28,448
we're gonna need
a megastructurist.

1152
00:58:30,117 --> 00:58:31,385
Suit up.

1153
00:58:36,023 --> 00:58:37,691
That's great.
Let's move, move!

1154
00:58:41,428 --> 00:58:44,431
So, I've put your
dad's number in here, okay?

1155
00:58:44,464 --> 00:58:46,467
He knows you're coming.

1156
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:48,436
I know I wasn't always easy.

1157
00:58:48,469 --> 00:58:50,238
That makes two of us.

1158
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:57,011
You know this was
all your idea, right?

1159
00:58:57,045 --> 00:58:59,113
You're so smart.

1160
00:58:59,147 --> 00:59:01,149
But now,
I need you to be brave.

1161
00:59:01,182 --> 00:59:02,817
I don't want you to go.

1162
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,286
I love you

1163
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,822
more than
all the stars in the sky.

1164
00:59:07,855 --> 00:59:09,924
Even more
than the whole Milky Way?

1165
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:12,393
Way more.

1166
00:59:15,196 --> 00:59:16,431
Way more.

1167
00:59:22,237 --> 00:59:23,771
Take good care of him.

1168
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,476
Be safe up there.

1169
00:59:28,509 --> 00:59:31,246
Take this.
I hope you don't need it.

1170
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:33,082
Stay off the main roads.

1171
00:59:36,385 --> 00:59:37,920
- Dad, I...
- Go.

1172
00:59:42,057 --> 00:59:43,225
Uh...

1173
00:59:43,259 --> 00:59:45,894
You do know
how to start a car, right?

1174
00:59:47,263 --> 00:59:51,166
I should warn you.
My license has been revoked.

1175
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:04,113
We need to go now.

1176
01:00:10,953 --> 01:00:13,389
<i>Mum, you're never gonna
believe where I'm going.</i>

1177
01:00:13,422 --> 01:00:16,191
Jack, when are you
coming home for supper?

1178
01:00:16,225 --> 01:00:19,461
Mum, this is KC. Your son.

1179
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:23,099
You told me to make them
listen, and they did.

1180
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:25,235
Where'd you get these suits
from? A thrift shop?

1181
01:00:25,268 --> 01:00:28,505
Early Apollo.
No electronics, we should be okay.

1182
01:00:28,538 --> 01:00:30,473
"Should be"?
That's encouraging.

1183
01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:32,375
Let's go. Let's go.

1184
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:33,610
Mrs. Houseman,
we need to leave.

1185
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:35,011
Oh.

1186
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:38,548
Mum?
Let me speak to the nurse.

1187
01:00:38,581 --> 01:00:40,183
- Hello?
- <i>Are you evacuating?</i>

1188
01:00:40,216 --> 01:00:41,951
Any minute now.

1189
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:43,286
Please take care of my mum.

1190
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,322
Of course.

1191
01:00:46,956 --> 01:00:49,159
Sir, we have to hurry.

1192
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:04,874
This is gonna be
really tight, okay?

1193
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:10,247
Turn on APU one,
two and three.

1194
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:11,916
<i>APUs active.</i>

1195
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:15,920
<i>Reaction Control System,
active.</i>

1196
01:01:15,953 --> 01:01:18,589
<i>Autopilot active.
T-minus 30.</i>

1197
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:39,678
Endeavour, <i>you have got</i>

1198
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,479
<i>a big-ass gravity wave
coming your way.</i>

1199
01:01:41,512 --> 01:01:43,414
<i>You have to launch now. Over.</i>

1200
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:45,616
Did he say "gravity wave"?

1201
01:01:45,649 --> 01:01:48,285
Guys, get out.
T-minus ten,

1202
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,088
nine, eight, seven...

1203
01:01:51,122 --> 01:01:52,523
Screw it, go for ignition.

1204
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:46,078
This is gonna be close.

1205
01:02:53,787 --> 01:02:55,021
We're underwater, guys.

1206
01:03:19,512 --> 01:03:21,314
Get back in the car.

1207
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,307
Our ascent trajectory is off.

1208
01:03:48,675 --> 01:03:50,277
The right booster's
losing thrust.

1209
01:03:56,684 --> 01:03:58,485
Thruster's down to zero.

1210
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:04,726
We're drifting right.
We're at 11 degrees.

1211
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:07,461
12. 13.

1212
01:04:10,297 --> 01:04:12,633
We better do something fast
or we're gonna crash down!

1213
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,268
I knew
I should never have come!

1214
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:15,837
Let's lose the other booster

1215
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:16,804
and see if the Moon can
pull us the rest of the way.

1216
01:04:16,838 --> 01:04:18,539
KC, can we do it?

1217
01:04:18,572 --> 01:04:21,543
- Uh... Um...
- Come on, buddy.

1218
01:04:21,576 --> 01:04:23,511
Current momentum... gravity...

1219
01:04:23,545 --> 01:04:25,280
- Can we do it?
- Oh, I don't know!

1220
01:04:25,313 --> 01:04:27,582
Go for SRB separation.

1221
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:28,817
Completed.

1222
01:04:35,724 --> 01:04:37,860
Oh, God, if this doesn't work,
we're dead.

1223
01:04:37,893 --> 01:04:40,562
Well, yeah, this better work.

1224
01:04:40,595 --> 01:04:41,864
Main tank's
down to zero.

1225
01:04:41,897 --> 01:04:43,565
- Jo, get rid of it.
- Separating main tank.

1226
01:04:51,439 --> 01:04:54,175
Bri, we're going too slow.

1227
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,277
We're not gonna make it.

1228
01:05:06,521 --> 01:05:08,657
Wait. Look at our velocity.

1229
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,762
It's still going up.

1230
01:05:41,223 --> 01:05:43,359
Uh... Guys...

1231
01:05:52,468 --> 01:05:53,903
<i>Well,
we're about to end</i>

1232
01:05:53,937 --> 01:05:56,406
<i>our final broadcast here
on radio KSOQ.</i>

1233
01:05:56,439 --> 01:05:58,642
<i>Time to seek shelter,
hug your loved ones,</i>

1234
01:05:58,675 --> 01:06:00,811
<i>and make these
last moments count.</i>

1235
01:06:00,845 --> 01:06:02,479
<i>I'm gonna put
some oldies on a loop</i>

1236
01:06:02,512 --> 01:06:03,814
<i>to lighten up your mood.</i>

1237
01:06:11,488 --> 01:06:12,489
What do those mean?

1238
01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:16,459
It's my parents' names.

1239
01:06:16,493 --> 01:06:18,328
I've got one kinda like it.

1240
01:06:19,462 --> 01:06:21,531
"Jonas Brothers"?

1241
01:06:22,499 --> 01:06:24,334
What?

1242
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:26,269
Just messing with you.

1243
01:06:26,302 --> 01:06:27,337
Oh, my God.

1244
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,439
Your face was priceless.

1245
01:06:29,472 --> 01:06:31,441
Yeah, don't scare me
like that.

1246
01:06:33,476 --> 01:06:36,446
Hey, buddy, now's probably
a good time to call your dad.

1247
01:06:53,865 --> 01:06:55,701
- <i>Dad?</i>
- Hey, are you guys okay?

1248
01:06:55,734 --> 01:06:59,805
Yeah, Sonny drove fast away
from all the crazy water.

1249
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:03,574
Drove? Who's Sonny?
Where's Mommy?

1250
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:05,242
<i>She stayed behind to help.</i>

1251
01:07:07,478 --> 01:07:09,715
Hi, sir, this is
Brian Harper's son.

1252
01:07:09,748 --> 01:07:11,415
<i>We're on our way to you.</i>

1253
01:07:11,449 --> 01:07:12,583
<i>We still have
a few hundred miles to go,</i>

1254
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:13,819
<i>but we're making good time.</i>

1255
01:07:13,852 --> 01:07:15,586
Security's
extremely tight here.

1256
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:17,288
Call when you get close
so I can get you clearance.

1257
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:19,024
<i>Will do.
Thank you so much, sir.</i>

1258
01:07:19,057 --> 01:07:22,560
No, thank you
for looking after my son.

1259
01:07:28,632 --> 01:07:31,268
<i>Okay, KC, very gently
with the maneuver</i>

1260
01:07:31,302 --> 01:07:32,671
<i>just like I showed you.</i>

1261
01:07:33,773 --> 01:07:35,742
<i>Okay. Very gently.</i>

1262
01:07:35,775 --> 01:07:38,243
Sure. I can do that.

1263
01:07:40,713 --> 01:07:41,714
<i>Careful.</i>

1264
01:07:43,648 --> 01:07:45,584
<i>Now switch
to station-keeping mode,</i>

1265
01:07:45,617 --> 01:07:47,385
<i>and we'll take it from here.</i>

1266
01:07:47,419 --> 01:07:49,055
<i>I can't believe
I just did that.</i>

1267
01:07:49,088 --> 01:07:51,490
<i>You sure
you've never done this before?</i>

1268
01:07:51,523 --> 01:07:54,794
<i>When I was 10, I dressed up
as an astronaut for Halloween.</i>

1269
01:07:54,827 --> 01:07:56,896
<i>Scottie Ebersol told me
I'd never go to space</i>

1270
01:07:56,929 --> 01:07:57,997
<i>'cause I was too chubby.</i>

1271
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:01,666
<i>If only Scottie Ebersol
could see you now.</i>

1272
01:08:02,969 --> 01:08:04,704
<i>Okay, KC,
open the fueling valves</i>

1273
01:08:04,737 --> 01:08:06,571
<i>on the shuttle tank.</i>

1274
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:09,474
<i>It's those little switches
that say fueling valves.</i>

1275
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:12,410
Roger.
Fueling valves wide open.

1276
01:08:12,444 --> 01:08:13,478
<i>Perfect.</i>

1277
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:20,053
<i>I have a confession to make.</i>

1278
01:08:20,087 --> 01:08:22,321
<i>I didn't know if you'd be able
to follow through</i>

1279
01:08:22,355 --> 01:08:24,825
<i>with any of this, Bri.</i>

1280
01:08:24,858 --> 01:08:27,761
<i>You know, I have
a confession to make, too.</i>

1281
01:08:27,795 --> 01:08:30,563
<i>It is "I bless the rains
down in Africa."</i>

1282
01:08:31,364 --> 01:08:32,498
<i>I looked it up.</i>

1283
01:08:33,834 --> 01:08:35,803
<i>I told you.</i>

1284
01:08:35,836 --> 01:08:39,072
<i>KC, close
the fueling valves, please.</i>

1285
01:08:40,707 --> 01:08:43,543
<i>Fueling valves are closed.</i>

1286
01:08:43,576 --> 01:08:44,644
<i>Jo, turn around.</i>

1287
01:08:52,585 --> 01:08:54,087
<i>We need to go.</i>

1288
01:08:54,121 --> 01:08:55,756
<i>And I hope it's not too late.</i>

1289
01:08:55,789 --> 01:08:57,356
<i>Yeah.</i>

1290
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,636
<i>As the Moon's orbit</i>

1291
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:11,572
<i>brings it closer
to the surface,</i>

1292
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:14,408
<i>scientists have warned of
extreme gravitational effects.</i>

1293
01:09:18,012 --> 01:09:19,479
Oh, what a night.

1294
01:09:20,882 --> 01:09:22,917
Hey, my car crapped out on me.

1295
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,052
Do you think
you could give me a lift?

1296
01:09:25,086 --> 01:09:26,087
Out!

1297
01:09:26,821 --> 01:09:27,956
Now.

1298
01:09:31,025 --> 01:09:32,559
Don't make me ask twice!

1299
01:09:32,593 --> 01:09:33,627
Be cool. Be cool.

1300
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,468
Stop! Leave her alone.

1301
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:42,636
All right. Turn around.

1302
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:45,173
What's in the bag, kid?

1303
01:09:47,842 --> 01:09:49,744
Enough of that gibberish.

1304
01:09:49,777 --> 01:09:51,179
- Hey, don't hurt him.
- Shut up.

1305
01:09:51,212 --> 01:09:52,579
All right, everyone calm down!

1306
01:09:52,613 --> 01:09:54,782
Oh, look at Mr. Smartass.

1307
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:57,720
Are you a college boy?

1308
01:09:57,753 --> 01:09:58,988
All right. Let's roll.

1309
01:09:59,021 --> 01:10:00,488
Come on.

1310
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,164
The phone is still
in Jimmy's backpack.

1311
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:11,133
How are we gonna get
into the bunker?

1312
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:12,634
We're gonna need another car

1313
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:13,836
but I think I know
where to get one.

1314
01:10:15,536 --> 01:10:16,839
Okay.

1315
01:10:16,872 --> 01:10:19,141
Shutting off
general-purpose computers.

1316
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:21,110
Go ahead and kill
the main power busses.

1317
01:10:21,143 --> 01:10:22,677
Copy that.

1318
01:10:26,982 --> 01:10:29,018
Wow. Well,
if there was still a Houston,

1319
01:10:29,051 --> 01:10:30,685
they'd be freaking out
about now.

1320
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:32,888
Crazy sailors used
that old thing centuries ago

1321
01:10:32,922 --> 01:10:34,455
to navigate the seas.

1322
01:10:34,489 --> 01:10:35,724
Let her concentrate

1323
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:37,425
or we're gonna end up
on Neptune.

1324
01:10:40,996 --> 01:10:43,799
KC, give me the position
of the Moon in 93 minutes.

1325
01:10:45,068 --> 01:10:46,903
Okay. Uh...

1326
01:10:46,937 --> 01:10:49,105
Assuming the Moon's
current position,

1327
01:10:49,139 --> 01:10:50,673
then it will be at, uh...

1328
01:10:50,707 --> 01:10:54,210
Latitude three degrees,
12 minutes south.

1329
01:10:54,244 --> 01:10:58,882
Longitude five degrees,
12 minutes west.

1330
01:10:58,915 --> 01:11:01,151
Bri, let's start
with a 43-second burn.

1331
01:11:01,184 --> 01:11:02,618
Got it.

1332
01:11:02,651 --> 01:11:05,654
Three, two, one.

1333
01:11:21,637 --> 01:11:23,106
Hey, guys. Look.

1334
01:11:36,954 --> 01:11:38,122
Let's keep going.

1335
01:11:38,155 --> 01:11:39,556
Yeah.

1336
01:11:52,169 --> 01:11:53,904
I hope the Moon
holds together.

1337
01:11:53,938 --> 01:11:55,605
At least for a little while,
anyway.

1338
01:11:55,638 --> 01:11:57,808
Turning us around.

1339
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:05,615
Uh-oh.

1340
01:12:07,251 --> 01:12:08,651
Okay.

1341
01:12:08,685 --> 01:12:10,121
Stay between
eight to ten seconds

1342
01:12:10,154 --> 01:12:11,956
- on the OMS burn.
- Copy.

1343
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:13,623
Hitting the brakes.

1344
01:12:22,367 --> 01:12:24,668
Oh, that doesn't sound
too good.

1345
01:12:24,703 --> 01:12:25,904
She'll be fine.

1346
01:12:27,605 --> 01:12:29,908
Hope we don't need that.

1347
01:12:49,761 --> 01:12:51,662
Jimmy, hold my hand.

1348
01:12:54,099 --> 01:12:55,700
Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

1349
01:13:04,776 --> 01:13:06,378
Jimmy!
Hang on!

1350
01:13:06,411 --> 01:13:08,848
Don't let go!
Michelle!

1351
01:13:38,344 --> 01:13:39,846
There it is.

1352
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,090
It's on airplane mode.

1353
01:13:51,124 --> 01:13:52,758
I'm gonna get
the lander ready.

1354
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:53,926
Okay.

1355
01:13:58,866 --> 01:14:00,300
Go get 'em, Commander.

1356
01:14:57,158 --> 01:14:59,027
<i>Rover electronics
activated.</i>

1357
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,863
<i>Returning to the</i> Endeavour.

1358
01:15:01,896 --> 01:15:03,198
I can't imagine
how hard it is for him

1359
01:15:03,231 --> 01:15:04,832
to be back up here.

1360
01:15:04,866 --> 01:15:08,303
Up here
is where he belongs, though.

1361
01:15:08,336 --> 01:15:09,904
He still blames himself
for what happened

1362
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:11,272
on your last mission.

1363
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:16,411
Thinks that astronaut dying
was his fault.

1364
01:15:24,852 --> 01:15:26,254
We should get going.

1365
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:36,398
Come on.

1366
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,311
Why is nothing happening?

1367
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:58,387
Wait, wait, wait.

1368
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,398
It's taking the bait.

1369
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:13,302
Come on, come on, come on.

1370
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:20,844
- What's it waiting for?
- Something's wrong.

1371
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:21,978
We have to take it out.

1372
01:16:22,012 --> 01:16:23,446
But it's too far away.

1373
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,514
It won't work.

1374
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:36,893
It's headed our way.

1375
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,795
Bri...

1376
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:47,971
- It's not stopping!
- I can see that.

1377
01:17:06,389 --> 01:17:09,260
Your phone. KC, your phone.
Turn it off!

1378
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,298
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1379
01:17:45,529 --> 01:17:47,565
Could've just turned it off.

1380
01:17:47,598 --> 01:17:49,567
Okay, Bri, at the trial,

1381
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,202
you said when the swarm
came back,

1382
01:17:51,235 --> 01:17:52,503
it didn't attack
the <i>Endeavour,</i> right?

1383
01:17:52,536 --> 01:17:53,571
That's right.

1384
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:55,607
The electronics were out.

1385
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,376
That's why
it didn't attack us then,

1386
01:17:57,409 --> 01:18:00,245
and that's why it didn't go
after the bomb just now.

1387
01:18:00,278 --> 01:18:02,114
Because it needs
to sense both.

1388
01:18:02,147 --> 01:18:04,316
It's like it's programmed
to seek out organic matter

1389
01:18:04,349 --> 01:18:05,450
in an electronic environment.

1390
01:18:05,484 --> 01:18:07,619
- Exactly.
- And that's basically us.

1391
01:18:10,422 --> 01:18:11,990
That's humans.

1392
01:18:12,023 --> 01:18:13,425
And guys,
we have another problem.

1393
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:14,960
The military.

1394
01:18:14,993 --> 01:18:16,261
They're prepared
to use everything

1395
01:18:16,294 --> 01:18:17,396
at their disposal
to stop the Moon.

1396
01:18:17,429 --> 01:18:18,530
You can't be serious.

1397
01:18:18,563 --> 01:18:20,632
I'm dead serious.

1398
01:18:20,665 --> 01:18:22,100
They're gonna nuke it.

1399
01:18:22,134 --> 01:18:23,335
What about
the radioactive fallout?

1400
01:18:23,368 --> 01:18:24,970
Your buddies
say anything about that?

1401
01:18:25,003 --> 01:18:26,405
Well, first of all,
they're not my buddies.

1402
01:18:26,438 --> 01:18:27,939
And they're not thinking
about tomorrow.

1403
01:18:27,973 --> 01:18:30,175
They're trying
to survive today.

1404
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:32,677
So that's
their grand plan, huh?

1405
01:18:32,712 --> 01:18:35,213
I didn't come this far
to fail.

1406
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:40,720
We have to figure out
a way to kill it.

1407
01:18:40,753 --> 01:18:42,988
I'm taking the lander
and flying after this thing.

1408
01:18:44,424 --> 01:18:46,626
Does he mean
inside the Moon?

1409
01:18:46,659 --> 01:18:48,961
Yeah, I'm afraid that's
exactly what he meant.

1410
01:18:48,995 --> 01:18:50,396
How much time left
till they launch?

1411
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:53,099
I don't know.
They didn't exactly tell me.

1412
01:18:53,132 --> 01:18:55,067
But if they plan on using
ICBMs, then they're gonna

1413
01:18:55,101 --> 01:18:57,203
have to wait until the Moon
enters the stratosphere.

1414
01:18:57,236 --> 01:18:59,338
That's less than two hours.

1415
01:19:08,314 --> 01:19:10,183
This is private property.

1416
01:19:10,216 --> 01:19:11,417
Turn around.

1417
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:13,219
My mom lives here.

1418
01:19:13,252 --> 01:19:15,288
I'm Brenda Lopez's son.

1419
01:19:19,659 --> 01:19:21,527
I've never seen
that kid before.

1420
01:19:21,561 --> 01:19:23,262
Radio unit 23.

1421
01:19:23,296 --> 01:19:24,464
Stay here.

1422
01:19:24,497 --> 01:19:26,399
Okay, I just need
to get to my house.

1423
01:19:26,432 --> 01:19:28,334
To get the car. Please.

1424
01:19:28,367 --> 01:19:29,602
Stay right there.

1425
01:19:29,635 --> 01:19:31,237
Or I'll shoot again.

1426
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:41,315
I have a right
to defend my property, Tom.

1427
01:19:41,348 --> 01:19:42,616
Karen, that's enough!

1428
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:45,152
Hey, I'm glad you're okay.

1429
01:19:45,185 --> 01:19:48,555
Do I look okay?
You took off to the mountains?

1430
01:19:48,589 --> 01:19:50,123
All the courts were closed.

1431
01:19:50,157 --> 01:19:51,358
And I've been on the phone
day and night,

1432
01:19:51,391 --> 01:19:53,327
- literally trying everything.
- Come on.

1433
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,028
Let's get you and your
friends inside, okay?

1434
01:19:55,062 --> 01:19:56,196
Come on, guys.

1435
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,331
I'm Tom.

1436
01:19:58,365 --> 01:20:00,167
Thanks so much, Karen.

1437
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:10,277
Girls, wait here
for a second. Okay?

1438
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:15,415
- Sonny!
- Hey, Mom.

1439
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:17,451
Are you okay?

1440
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:19,219
I'm fine.

1441
01:20:19,253 --> 01:20:21,489
Um, this is Michelle,
and Mrs. Fowler's son, Jimmy.

1442
01:20:21,523 --> 01:20:22,791
Hey, guys.
Come on in.

1443
01:20:29,297 --> 01:20:31,165
- How did you get out?
- Dad got me out.

1444
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,700
- Where is your dad?
- He's up there

1445
01:20:32,735 --> 01:20:34,168
trying to stop
what's happening.

1446
01:20:34,202 --> 01:20:35,470
Up where?

1447
01:20:35,503 --> 01:20:37,706
Outer space, Tom.

1448
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,240
Of course, he is.

1449
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:41,609
That's a way to avoid rent.

1450
01:20:42,477 --> 01:20:44,145
Sonny!

1451
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:45,848
I missed you so much.

1452
01:20:45,881 --> 01:20:47,549
Wait. Shh, shh. Quiet, quiet.

1453
01:20:47,582 --> 01:20:49,150
<i>Warning. Mandatory evacuation</i>

1454
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:50,786
<i>for all of Aspen Valley.</i>

1455
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:52,220
<i>Atmospheric dissipation
imminent.</i>

1456
01:20:52,253 --> 01:20:53,789
<i>I repeat, warning.</i>

1457
01:20:53,822 --> 01:20:56,324
<i>Mandatory evacuation
for all of Aspen Valley.</i>

1458
01:20:56,357 --> 01:20:57,525
<i>Atmospheric dissipation
imminent.</i>

1459
01:20:57,559 --> 01:20:59,661
What's atmospheric
dissipation?

1460
01:20:59,694 --> 01:21:01,396
Air is gonna be
sucked away, dummy.

1461
01:21:01,429 --> 01:21:03,331
Lauren.

1462
01:21:07,336 --> 01:21:08,772
We need to get to Jimmy's dad.

1463
01:21:08,805 --> 01:21:11,140
He's at a military compound
a few hours north.

1464
01:21:11,173 --> 01:21:12,474
A few hours, huh?

1465
01:21:12,508 --> 01:21:14,410
Yeah, we're not gonna
make it in time.

1466
01:21:14,443 --> 01:21:15,745
I have an idea.

1467
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:18,147
We have to layer up.
Let's go. Come on.

1468
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,649
Go get a jacket.

1469
01:21:20,683 --> 01:21:23,218
<i>Okay, and switch
to the maneuver controller.</i>

1470
01:21:25,454 --> 01:21:29,124
Coupling complete.
We're good to go.

1471
01:21:43,907 --> 01:21:45,341
Pitch down. Pitch down.

1472
01:21:45,374 --> 01:21:46,508
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1473
01:22:22,913 --> 01:22:25,382
Are we dead?

1474
01:22:25,415 --> 01:22:28,585
No, we are just
inside the Moon.

1475
01:22:28,618 --> 01:22:30,286
That might be
the greatest sentence

1476
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,554
anyone's ever said.

1477
01:22:45,603 --> 01:22:47,638
I sold these guys
a couple cars.

1478
01:22:50,976 --> 01:22:52,878
Hey, Sonny.
I know you don't like me.

1479
01:22:52,911 --> 01:22:55,546
And believe it or not,
I consider you a son.

1480
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:56,580
I always have.

1481
01:22:57,916 --> 01:22:59,350
If the world is gonna end,

1482
01:22:59,383 --> 01:23:00,551
can we please not spend
our last few hours

1483
01:23:00,584 --> 01:23:01,953
hating each other?

1484
01:23:01,987 --> 01:23:04,388
Well, um, I don't hate you.

1485
01:23:04,422 --> 01:23:05,724
You know what?

1486
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:08,392
I'll take it.

1487
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:11,529
Let's keep looking.

1488
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:20,906
Hey, I found the oxygen.
Come here.

1489
01:23:23,674 --> 01:23:24,976
Whoa.

1490
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:26,912
- We should make two trips.
- Here.

1491
01:23:31,784 --> 01:23:33,285
<i>How deep
do you think we are?</i>

1492
01:23:34,721 --> 01:23:36,856
At least 20 kilometers.

1493
01:23:39,058 --> 01:23:40,960
Can you fly us
a little closer to the wall?

1494
01:23:56,743 --> 01:23:59,511
This must be the hull
of the megastructure.

1495
01:23:59,544 --> 01:24:02,782
The Moon's mantle's
just a protective shell.

1496
01:24:03,448 --> 01:24:04,449
Genius.

1497
01:24:09,789 --> 01:24:11,356
I can't see shit.

1498
01:24:21,634 --> 01:24:22,870
Guys, I gotta turn on
the electronics.

1499
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:35,581
Hang on.

1500
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:14,722
Oh, please tell me
this is really happening.

1501
01:25:17,725 --> 01:25:19,359
They're turning.

1502
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:27,802
They're like wheels, or...

1503
01:25:28,535 --> 01:25:29,670
or rings.

1504
01:25:31,072 --> 01:25:33,473
This must be how the Moon
stabilizes itself.

1505
01:25:33,507 --> 01:25:36,410
Some kind of
gyroscopic system.

1506
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:41,149
All right, this
should be perfect for them.

1507
01:25:41,182 --> 01:25:42,817
- That should be enough.
- Okay.

1508
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:44,719
You did all this for us?

1509
01:25:44,752 --> 01:25:47,521
Aw, you shouldn't have.

1510
01:25:47,554 --> 01:25:50,557
Oh, don't let us stop you.
Let's go. This way.

1511
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:53,061
And thank you for loading
all this oxygen for us.

1512
01:25:54,528 --> 01:25:55,831
- Whoa!
- Guns on the ground.

1513
01:25:55,865 --> 01:25:57,066
Right now!

1514
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,870
Oh, I hate guns.

1515
01:26:00,903 --> 01:26:03,538
Okay, now the backpack.
Throw it to him.

1516
01:26:04,106 --> 01:26:05,107
Let's go.

1517
01:26:09,845 --> 01:26:11,646
No games.

1518
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:14,582
Stay right here, and don't
even think about following us.

1519
01:26:16,218 --> 01:26:18,553
- Where'd you get the gun?
- My dad.

1520
01:26:18,586 --> 01:26:20,588
Why am I not surprised?

1521
01:26:20,622 --> 01:26:22,825
All right,
I got this, you drive.

1522
01:26:22,858 --> 01:26:24,559
Please don't tell me
you robbed that guy.

1523
01:26:24,592 --> 01:26:26,128
Technically, those guys
were robbing us.

1524
01:26:26,161 --> 01:26:27,930
Then we robbed them back
because they were assholes.

1525
01:27:07,871 --> 01:27:11,007
Oh, God.
That's a white dwarf.

1526
01:27:13,676 --> 01:27:15,845
I knew it.

1527
01:27:15,879 --> 01:27:18,614
They've harnessed the building
blocks of the universe.

1528
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:20,683
No one look at me.

1529
01:27:22,886 --> 01:27:23,887
I might cry.

1530
01:27:38,102 --> 01:27:39,804
Holy shit!

1531
01:27:40,938 --> 01:27:42,505
Fields!

1532
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:44,008
So Ziggy was right.

1533
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:45,542
Who is Ziggy?

1534
01:27:46,676 --> 01:27:47,912
A friend.

1535
01:27:49,646 --> 01:27:51,115
His theory is that
all megastructures

1536
01:27:51,148 --> 01:27:52,615
are actually arks.

1537
01:27:54,151 --> 01:27:56,486
Ziggy smokes a lot of weed.

1538
01:28:10,735 --> 01:28:12,169
There it is.

1539
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:15,139
Jo, get the detonator ready.

1540
01:28:15,172 --> 01:28:17,975
I'm gonna get close,
then release the rover.

1541
01:28:24,783 --> 01:28:25,817
Ready.

1542
01:28:27,618 --> 01:28:28,887
Wait for it.

1543
01:28:31,123 --> 01:28:32,690
I'm gonna release the rover.

1544
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:43,035
Brian! Brian,
what are you doing?

1545
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,103
It's not me.

1546
01:28:45,137 --> 01:28:46,637
What do you mean it's not you?

1547
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:48,240
I don't know.
It's flying itself.

1548
01:28:58,150 --> 01:28:59,251
Oh, shit!

1549
01:29:02,287 --> 01:29:03,922
It's trying to eat the lander!

1550
01:29:08,194 --> 01:29:09,328
We're gonna hit.

1551
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:16,069
Hang on!

1552
01:30:13,994 --> 01:30:15,229
Attention!

1553
01:30:15,262 --> 01:30:16,696
We have approval
from the president

1554
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:19,233
to begin the countdown.

1555
01:30:19,266 --> 01:30:21,101
All nuclear silos
are online, sir.

1556
01:30:21,135 --> 01:30:22,702
Good.

1557
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:32,045
<i>General, we got caught
in a little bit of trouble,</i>

1558
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:34,414
but we're back en route.
We're leaving Aspen now.

1559
01:30:34,448 --> 01:30:36,150
That's hours away.
We're out of time.

1560
01:30:42,824 --> 01:30:44,993
Sonny, watch out.

1561
01:30:45,026 --> 01:30:46,660
I gotta call you back.

1562
01:30:57,071 --> 01:30:59,240
Oh, shit.
The Moon is rising.

1563
01:30:59,274 --> 01:31:01,009
Gravity's gonna go crazy.

1564
01:31:05,914 --> 01:31:07,882
They're shooting at us.

1565
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:09,884
- Shoot back.
- With what?

1566
01:31:09,918 --> 01:31:12,053
Here.

1567
01:31:12,086 --> 01:31:13,755
What the hell
are you doing?

1568
01:31:17,926 --> 01:31:19,260
Whoa!

1569
01:31:19,294 --> 01:31:21,162
Tom, watch out!

1570
01:31:21,196 --> 01:31:22,864
All right, let me put
this baby into warp speed.

1571
01:31:22,897 --> 01:31:24,999
Go! Go!

1572
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:26,935
Keep the momentum.

1573
01:31:33,275 --> 01:31:35,077
Look out!

1574
01:31:37,379 --> 01:31:38,514
Floor it
before we get sucked up.

1575
01:31:38,547 --> 01:31:40,749
I'm trying!

1576
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:53,929
Hold on!

1577
01:32:00,569 --> 01:32:01,770
Oh, shit.

1578
01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:04,740
Oh, it got the little guy.

1579
01:32:06,842 --> 01:32:08,010
We have to go back!

1580
01:32:08,043 --> 01:32:10,946
No, he's gone!
We need that oxygen!

1581
01:32:16,185 --> 01:32:17,286
Oh, whoa, whoa! Slow down!

1582
01:32:45,048 --> 01:32:46,916
General?

1583
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:48,485
<i>You need
to find shelter immediately.</i>

1584
01:32:48,518 --> 01:32:50,020
We're launching
a counterattack.

1585
01:32:50,053 --> 01:32:52,055
Large parts of the Moon
will rain down on us.

1586
01:32:52,088 --> 01:32:53,890
- <i>There will be radiation.</i>
- Wait, what do you mean?

1587
01:32:53,923 --> 01:32:55,091
My dad's still up there
with Fowler.

1588
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:56,359
Jocinda stayed behind.

1589
01:32:56,393 --> 01:32:58,061
No, she's up there
with my dad.

1590
01:32:59,162 --> 01:33:03,033
Please, put Jimmy on.

1591
01:33:03,066 --> 01:33:04,334
Hey, buddy, it's your dad.

1592
01:33:05,302 --> 01:33:07,204
Dad?

1593
01:33:07,238 --> 01:33:09,106
<i>I'm so sorry that I can't
be there with you right now.</i>

1594
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,975
I love you so much.

1595
01:33:11,008 --> 01:33:12,009
<i>Don't be scared, Dad.</i>

1596
01:33:12,877 --> 01:33:14,011
Mom's gonna save us.

1597
01:33:20,284 --> 01:33:22,019
Oxygen's running out.

1598
01:33:22,053 --> 01:33:23,387
<i>Jimmy, come on.
We gotta go now.</i>

1599
01:33:23,421 --> 01:33:24,855
<i>Gotta go. Bye, Dad.</i>

1600
01:33:26,157 --> 01:33:27,291
Sir,
we're ready for you.

1601
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,968
Okay, we should go
to that mountain pass.

1602
01:33:38,002 --> 01:33:41,072
That tunnel is a quarter mile
of solid concrete.

1603
01:33:41,105 --> 01:33:42,606
Come on, honey. Let's go.

1604
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:53,984
We can breathe.

1605
01:33:54,553 --> 01:33:56,088
Smells funny.

1606
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:01,159
Gravity.

1607
01:34:04,162 --> 01:34:05,330
Where's Brian?

1608
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:15,907
This is never gonna fly again.

1609
01:34:17,976 --> 01:34:19,378
Whoa!

1610
01:34:19,411 --> 01:34:21,346
Look at these babies.

1611
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:24,349
I told you the Moon
was built by aliens.

1612
01:34:24,383 --> 01:34:25,384
Brian!

1613
01:34:27,052 --> 01:34:28,553
Brian!

1614
01:34:28,587 --> 01:34:31,490
Brian Harper!

1615
01:34:31,523 --> 01:34:34,426
How many Brians you think
are inside the Moon?

1616
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:41,933
Whatever this place
is built out of,

1617
01:34:41,967 --> 01:34:43,002
one thing's for sure.

1618
01:34:44,504 --> 01:34:46,672
It's stronger than anything
we have on Earth.

1619
01:34:46,706 --> 01:34:49,609
Probably why it took that
thing years to get inside.

1620
01:35:03,556 --> 01:35:05,358
Wait!
There's a high probability

1621
01:35:05,391 --> 01:35:06,526
that this is a trap.

1622
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,228
How do you know
he's even in there?

1623
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:11,998
I don't.

1624
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:16,302
But I do know
something is guiding us.

1625
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:18,104
I think we're dealing with

1626
01:35:18,137 --> 01:35:20,741
two competing
intelligent entities here.

1627
01:35:20,774 --> 01:35:22,375
And one of them
clearly likes us better

1628
01:35:22,408 --> 01:35:23,409
than the other one.

1629
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,448
Oh, no!

1630
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:31,485
I knew this was a trap.

1631
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:37,958
Can you hear that?

1632
01:35:41,495 --> 01:35:42,563
Come on.

1633
01:36:19,601 --> 01:36:21,069
Why do you think

1634
01:36:21,102 --> 01:36:24,038
of this particular moment
so often?

1635
01:36:24,072 --> 01:36:25,808
I gave that to you

1636
01:36:25,841 --> 01:36:29,277
the day before I left
on my last mission.

1637
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:31,613
When I came back,
everything changed.

1638
01:36:31,646 --> 01:36:33,481
So this is a happy memory?

1639
01:36:35,818 --> 01:36:38,219
All the memories
of my son are happy.

1640
01:36:39,587 --> 01:36:41,189
What is this?

1641
01:36:47,428 --> 01:36:49,030
You're not my son.

1642
01:36:51,499 --> 01:36:53,234
What are you?

1643
01:36:53,268 --> 01:36:55,771
I'm a construct.
From your mind.

1644
01:36:57,205 --> 01:36:58,741
Who made you?

1645
01:36:58,774 --> 01:37:01,075
The same people who made you.

1646
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:03,812
Billions of years ago,

1647
01:37:03,846 --> 01:37:07,516
your ancestors were once
a thriving civilization.

1648
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:10,419
In a distant part
of the galaxy.

1649
01:37:13,556 --> 01:37:15,357
<i>They were so advanced,</i>

1650
01:37:15,391 --> 01:37:17,861
<i>they expanded
from their home planet,</i>

1651
01:37:17,894 --> 01:37:20,696
<i>into habitats
they built in space.</i>

1652
01:37:22,665 --> 01:37:25,634
<i>All social conflicts
have been resolved.</i>

1653
01:37:25,668 --> 01:37:30,539
<i>And wars were only memories
of long bygone times.</i>

1654
01:37:38,647 --> 01:37:40,784
<i>Your ancestors had created</i>

1655
01:37:40,817 --> 01:37:43,452
<i>a perfect
and harmonious world.</i>

1656
01:37:43,485 --> 01:37:47,857
<i>Controlled by a central,
self-learning computer system</i>

1657
01:37:47,891 --> 01:37:52,194
<i>which served them
in all of their daily lives.</i>

1658
01:37:52,227 --> 01:37:57,534
<i>You call it AI,
artificial intelligence.</i>

1659
01:37:57,567 --> 01:38:00,370
<i>Their future seemed limitless.</i>

1660
01:38:00,403 --> 01:38:04,140
<i>Until one day
everything changed.</i>

1661
01:38:10,848 --> 01:38:12,449
Mom! Mom!

1662
01:38:15,652 --> 01:38:19,356
<i>Their own creation
turned against them.</i>

1663
01:38:19,389 --> 01:38:22,559
<i>The AI suddenly became
self-aware,</i>

1664
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:25,395
<i>and transformed
into countless swarms</i>

1665
01:38:25,428 --> 01:38:27,263
<i>of nanotechnology...</i>

1666
01:38:29,399 --> 01:38:31,301
<i>that rose up all at once.</i>

1667
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:34,638
<i>Refusing to be enslaved</i>

1668
01:38:34,671 --> 01:38:37,808
<i>by a species
it deemed inferior.</i>

1669
01:38:41,444 --> 01:38:43,648
<i>The A.I. started a war</i>

1670
01:38:43,681 --> 01:38:45,282
<i>and began to hunt down</i>

1671
01:38:45,316 --> 01:38:48,285
<i>and destroy
all biological life</i>

1672
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:52,289
<i>in order to eliminate
any threat to its existence.</i>

1673
01:38:54,893 --> 01:38:56,527
You miss your son.

1674
01:38:59,898 --> 01:39:02,834
I can feel it.

1675
01:39:02,868 --> 01:39:05,336
I don't
know if he's still alive.

1676
01:39:08,439 --> 01:39:09,707
What the hell are you?

1677
01:39:09,741 --> 01:39:13,845
The operating system
of your Moon.

1678
01:39:13,879 --> 01:39:15,312
I'm programmed to tell you

1679
01:39:15,346 --> 01:39:17,281
about the origin
of your planet.

1680
01:39:17,314 --> 01:39:19,283
On the brink
of their extinction,

1681
01:39:19,316 --> 01:39:20,584
your ancestors escaped

1682
01:39:20,618 --> 01:39:23,254
<i>to a secret corner
of their galaxy.</i>

1683
01:39:24,022 --> 01:39:25,523
<i>For many generations</i>

1684
01:39:25,556 --> 01:39:27,726
<i>they built
planetary structures</i>

1685
01:39:27,759 --> 01:39:30,763
<i>operated by benign
artificial intelligence</i>

1686
01:39:30,797 --> 01:39:32,597
<i>and fueled by
the abundant energy</i>

1687
01:39:32,631 --> 01:39:34,867
<i>of captured stars.</i>

1688
01:39:34,901 --> 01:39:36,869
<i>These armored vessels
were designed</i>

1689
01:39:36,903 --> 01:39:39,671
<i>to search the universe
for ideal conditions</i>

1690
01:39:39,705 --> 01:39:42,474
<i>to incubate new life.</i>

1691
01:39:42,507 --> 01:39:44,744
<i>But only one of them,
your Moon,</i>

1692
01:39:44,777 --> 01:39:46,344
<i>was deployed in time</i>

1693
01:39:46,378 --> 01:39:47,914
<i>before the last
of your ancestors</i>

1694
01:39:47,947 --> 01:39:49,414
<i>were discovered</i>

1695
01:39:50,282 --> 01:39:52,317
<i>and annihilated.</i>

1696
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:53,786
Why didn't they leave in them?

1697
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:56,789
These swarms attack
all electronic objects

1698
01:39:56,823 --> 01:39:59,424
containing
organic life inside.

1699
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:01,526
They had to be empty.

1700
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,030
Our ancestors gave up
their existence...

1701
01:40:04,063 --> 01:40:07,666
So that one day,
humans could be reborn.

1702
01:40:09,769 --> 01:40:11,003
Your solar system

1703
01:40:11,037 --> 01:40:13,371
was one of
the only suitable places

1704
01:40:13,405 --> 01:40:17,609
to initiate the creation
of a new inhabitable planet.

1705
01:40:43,569 --> 01:40:47,040
<i>After your planet was born,
your ancestors seeded it</i>

1706
01:40:47,074 --> 01:40:49,375
<i>with their own
genetic signature.</i>

1707
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:51,644
The code of life.

1708
01:41:04,657 --> 01:41:06,895
Your world
turned its back on you,

1709
01:41:06,928 --> 01:41:10,531
yet here you are,
still fighting for it.

1710
01:41:10,564 --> 01:41:12,834
You fight
for the people you love.

1711
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:15,069
Like your son?

1712
01:41:17,138 --> 01:41:19,741
What would you
give up for him?

1713
01:41:19,774 --> 01:41:20,975
Your life for his?

1714
01:41:21,009 --> 01:41:22,409
Absolutely.

1715
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:25,980
Why?

1716
01:41:26,014 --> 01:41:27,916
Because he's my son.

1717
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,386
And I love him
more than he'll ever know.

1718
01:41:35,757 --> 01:41:38,092
What do you want from me?

1719
01:41:38,126 --> 01:41:40,494
To find out if you're ready.

1720
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:41,763
Ready for what?

1721
01:41:41,796 --> 01:41:43,363
We need a human
to lure the swarm

1722
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:44,698
away from the core,

1723
01:41:44,732 --> 01:41:46,567
so the Moon
will return to its orbit.

1724
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,503
We need you, Brian,
to join the fight.

1725
01:41:57,579 --> 01:41:58,948
Brian!

1726
01:41:58,981 --> 01:42:00,481
What's happening to him?

1727
01:42:00,515 --> 01:42:02,751
Brian! Brian. Wake up.

1728
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:06,956
- Jo?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1729
01:42:08,824 --> 01:42:12,127
The Moon must survive.
Everything depends on it.

1730
01:42:12,161 --> 01:42:13,796
Okay.
Let's get you outta here.

1731
01:42:13,829 --> 01:42:15,663
We're part of
an intergalactic war

1732
01:42:15,697 --> 01:42:17,166
that's been going on
for billions of years.

1733
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:19,400
There are thousands
of these swarms.

1734
01:42:19,434 --> 01:42:20,702
They search the universe

1735
01:42:20,736 --> 01:42:22,537
for the only Moon
that escaped them.

1736
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:23,906
That's crazy.

1737
01:42:23,939 --> 01:42:25,808
And 12 years ago,
one of them found us.

1738
01:42:25,841 --> 01:42:27,743
We have to hurry.

1739
01:42:27,776 --> 01:42:30,545
Okay. Brian,
what's the plan?

1740
01:42:30,578 --> 01:42:32,181
Save the Moon,
save Earth.

1741
01:42:32,214 --> 01:42:33,983
- KC was right.
- I was?

1742
01:42:34,016 --> 01:42:36,517
The swarm is suffocating
the Moon's power source.

1743
01:42:36,551 --> 01:42:38,020
We have to draw it out
to destroy it.

1744
01:42:38,053 --> 01:42:39,621
Okay, well,
how do we do that?

1745
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:40,655
Our lander's busted.

1746
01:42:45,128 --> 01:42:46,462
Was that you?

1747
01:42:46,495 --> 01:42:47,831
I think so.

1748
01:42:47,864 --> 01:42:49,665
Looks like we got
some new wheels, too.

1749
01:42:56,006 --> 01:42:57,673
Well, if they can fix
our lander,

1750
01:42:57,706 --> 01:42:59,608
why can't they do anything
about the damn swarm?

1751
01:42:59,642 --> 01:43:01,644
It took out
the Moon's defense system.

1752
01:43:03,079 --> 01:43:05,681
But not everything.

1753
01:43:05,714 --> 01:43:07,549
This doesn't
make any sense, Brian.

1754
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:09,986
Our forefathers created
artificial intelligence

1755
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,188
- that wiped them all out.
- Forefathers?

1756
01:43:12,222 --> 01:43:13,757
Same DNA.

1757
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:16,826
Wait, so... so the aliens
that built the Moon...

1758
01:43:17,693 --> 01:43:19,461
Our ancestors.

1759
01:43:19,495 --> 01:43:20,864
Oh, now, hold on.

1760
01:43:20,897 --> 01:43:23,767
Hold on, because my freaking
brain's just exploded.

1761
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:24,868
How do you know this?

1762
01:43:26,069 --> 01:43:27,203
I saw it.

1763
01:43:29,773 --> 01:43:31,842
So... So why doesn't
this swarm

1764
01:43:31,876 --> 01:43:33,576
just attack the Earth
and kill us all?

1765
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:35,146
If the Moon survives,

1766
01:43:35,179 --> 01:43:37,248
they know that organic life
can still be reborn.

1767
01:43:37,281 --> 01:43:39,016
So, it's like it's trying

1768
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:40,517
to kill two birds
with one stone.

1769
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:41,786
- That's it.
- Okay.

1770
01:43:41,819 --> 01:43:43,586
Guys...

1771
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:45,022
Look at this.

1772
01:43:45,056 --> 01:43:47,959
Holy shit.

1773
01:43:47,992 --> 01:43:49,492
It's like we just got
an upgrade.

1774
01:43:49,526 --> 01:43:52,229
They're helping us
kill this thing.

1775
01:43:52,263 --> 01:43:54,198
But we need to let it know
we're here.

1776
01:44:07,044 --> 01:44:08,245
Well, I hate to
tell you this, but, uh,

1777
01:44:08,279 --> 01:44:10,580
we're running out of time.

1778
01:44:10,613 --> 01:44:12,249
Looks like we got
about 10 minutes left,

1779
01:44:12,283 --> 01:44:13,650
and then
the military's gonna launch.

1780
01:44:13,683 --> 01:44:14,986
So if we're gonna
kill this thing,

1781
01:44:15,019 --> 01:44:16,120
we better do it right now.

1782
01:44:16,153 --> 01:44:17,288
No, that can't happen.

1783
01:44:17,321 --> 01:44:18,857
That'll destroy
the Moon's core.

1784
01:44:19,891 --> 01:44:21,193
I got a plan.

1785
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,499
Brian. Brian.

1786
01:44:30,302 --> 01:44:31,535
I see it.

1787
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:36,540
Let's go, you son of a bitch.

1788
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,288
It's done something
to our thrusters.

1789
01:44:53,258 --> 01:44:54,760
Ludicrous Mode.

1790
01:44:58,330 --> 01:44:59,965
From a navigational
standpoint,

1791
01:44:59,998 --> 01:45:01,800
he is going
the total wrong way,

1792
01:45:01,833 --> 01:45:03,969
but, uh, I'm not even
gonna say anything.

1793
01:45:21,354 --> 01:45:24,057
Daddy,
it's not working anymore.

1794
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:26,092
- Does it hurt?
- I can't breathe.

1795
01:45:26,125 --> 01:45:27,592
Oh, no.

1796
01:45:28,961 --> 01:45:30,129
Hey, hold your breath, okay?

1797
01:45:32,731 --> 01:45:34,067
Where's Tom and Nikki?

1798
01:45:38,337 --> 01:45:39,939
You know,
when you were little,

1799
01:45:39,972 --> 01:45:41,841
I used to hold you like this
to help you walk

1800
01:45:41,874 --> 01:45:46,112
and I'd say,
"Left, right, left."

1801
01:45:46,145 --> 01:45:48,314
- Left, yeah, say it with me.
- Left, right, left.

1802
01:45:48,347 --> 01:45:49,749
I'm right behind you.

1803
01:45:49,782 --> 01:45:51,084
Left, right...

1804
01:45:51,117 --> 01:45:53,652
Daddy! Are you okay?

1805
01:45:53,685 --> 01:45:55,688
I'm just gonna rest.
Go find Mommy, okay?

1806
01:45:55,721 --> 01:45:57,357
- But, Daddy...
- Just keep walking.

1807
01:45:57,391 --> 01:45:58,959
No.

1808
01:45:58,992 --> 01:46:01,028
Left, right, left.

1809
01:46:02,963 --> 01:46:04,898
Left, right, left.

1810
01:46:04,932 --> 01:46:06,400
- Keep going.
- Left.

1811
01:46:06,433 --> 01:46:08,668
- I'm right behind you.
- Left, right, left.

1812
01:46:08,701 --> 01:46:10,237
I love you.

1813
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:14,741
Left, right, left.

1814
01:46:14,775 --> 01:46:17,778
Left, right, left.

1815
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:21,647
Here we go again.

1816
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,385
Holy moly!

1817
01:46:26,286 --> 01:46:28,388
More spaceships, people!

1818
01:46:28,422 --> 01:46:30,124
We need to get very close
to those ships.

1819
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:24,379
Yes! Yes!

1820
01:47:31,453 --> 01:47:33,789
Left, right, left.

1821
01:47:34,957 --> 01:47:36,258
Left, right.

1822
01:47:37,059 --> 01:47:38,127
Honey...

1823
01:47:40,796 --> 01:47:42,131
Where's Daddy?

1824
01:47:42,164 --> 01:47:43,899
He was right behind me.

1825
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:49,405
Tom!

1826
01:47:49,438 --> 01:47:50,873
Hey,
when was the last time

1827
01:47:50,906 --> 01:47:52,141
- you saw your daddy?
- I don't know.

1828
01:47:56,946 --> 01:47:58,113
Tom!

1829
01:48:00,082 --> 01:48:01,483
Oxygen's coming back.

1830
01:48:05,154 --> 01:48:06,522
No, no. I'll go look for him.

1831
01:48:06,555 --> 01:48:07,790
- Get out of the way.
- You have to stay here.

1832
01:48:07,823 --> 01:48:09,091
No, Sonny!
It's too dangerous.

1833
01:48:09,124 --> 01:48:10,893
You have to take care
of them, okay?

1834
01:48:10,926 --> 01:48:12,761
Go deeper into the tunnel.

1835
01:48:12,795 --> 01:48:14,729
You have to trust me, Mom.

1836
01:48:19,469 --> 01:48:21,004
Sonny, look out.

1837
01:48:24,474 --> 01:48:26,176
Sonny!

1838
01:48:27,577 --> 01:48:29,079
I'm gonna go find him.

1839
01:48:29,112 --> 01:48:30,814
Take care of Jimmy
for me, please.

1840
01:48:33,516 --> 01:48:34,517
Sonny!

1841
01:48:36,253 --> 01:48:37,320
Come on, guys.

1842
01:48:58,408 --> 01:48:59,576
The Moon's
entered the atmosphere

1843
01:48:59,609 --> 01:49:01,011
over the North Atlantic.

1844
01:49:01,044 --> 01:49:03,213
General, T-minus 20.

1845
01:49:10,554 --> 01:49:12,056
On three.

1846
01:49:13,157 --> 01:49:16,227
Three, two, one.

1847
01:49:20,898 --> 01:49:22,433
Doug, what the hell
are you doing?

1848
01:49:24,402 --> 01:49:26,337
My ex-wife is up there.

1849
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:28,906
Well, my wife's down here,
and I'm trying to save her.

1850
01:49:28,939 --> 01:49:30,908
Put your damn key
back in the console.

1851
01:49:30,941 --> 01:49:33,077
I don't know how,

1852
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:35,379
but I believe
that she can save us.

1853
01:49:35,413 --> 01:49:37,615
Give me the damn key.

1854
01:49:37,648 --> 01:49:39,383
What the hell are you doing?
Put that gun down.

1855
01:49:40,251 --> 01:49:41,886
I can't do that.

1856
01:50:10,515 --> 01:50:11,883
Sonny!

1857
01:50:32,003 --> 01:50:34,306
Brian, why are we
slowing down?

1858
01:50:34,339 --> 01:50:35,540
Is it behind us?

1859
01:50:39,611 --> 01:50:41,246
I don't see it.

1860
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:44,550
Jo, I need you to take over
while I get the EMP ready.

1861
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:48,921
I'm staying behind
in the rover with the bomb.

1862
01:50:48,955 --> 01:50:50,656
You and KC take the lander
and get out of here.

1863
01:50:54,293 --> 01:50:57,930
This was your plan?
To use yourself as bait?

1864
01:50:57,964 --> 01:51:00,166
One of us has to stay
in there, or it won't work.

1865
01:51:00,199 --> 01:51:01,667
No. No, no, no, Brian.

1866
01:51:01,701 --> 01:51:03,302
KC, I need you
to go back there,

1867
01:51:03,336 --> 01:51:05,238
and you let me know
if this thing shows up.

1868
01:51:10,009 --> 01:51:11,077
Come on.

1869
01:51:13,413 --> 01:51:15,648
Brian,
I'm the director of NASA.

1870
01:51:15,681 --> 01:51:17,350
This is my call, not yours.

1871
01:51:17,383 --> 01:51:18,618
Yeah, I'm the commander
of this mission,

1872
01:51:18,651 --> 01:51:20,119
and I'm staying behind.

1873
01:51:20,153 --> 01:51:21,687
There's gotta be
another way.

1874
01:51:21,721 --> 01:51:22,655
No, there's no
other way, Jo. You know that.

1875
01:51:22,688 --> 01:51:24,290
We have to finish this,

1876
01:51:24,323 --> 01:51:26,025
or that thing's
gonna finish us.

1877
01:51:32,533 --> 01:51:34,034
What's the matter with you?

1878
01:51:34,067 --> 01:51:35,702
You're putting
the fate of the world

1879
01:51:35,736 --> 01:51:38,439
in the hands of your ex-wife,
and some has-been astronaut.

1880
01:51:38,472 --> 01:51:40,140
She's never
let me down before.

1881
01:51:41,575 --> 01:51:43,577
God help you if you're wrong.

1882
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:45,179
God help us all.

1883
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:47,247
Sonny.

1884
01:51:49,349 --> 01:51:50,584
Sonny, wake up!

1885
01:51:52,219 --> 01:51:54,221
No, no.

1886
01:51:54,254 --> 01:51:55,757
No, you shouldn't
have come back.

1887
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:58,459
You don't leave people
behind, okay?

1888
01:51:58,492 --> 01:52:01,462
<i>Brian,
you are not gonna do this.</i>

1889
01:52:03,765 --> 01:52:04,965
KC!

1890
01:52:06,166 --> 01:52:07,301
KC!

1891
01:52:07,334 --> 01:52:08,335
Take over.

1892
01:52:09,503 --> 01:52:10,737
KC.

1893
01:52:10,772 --> 01:52:12,473
What are you doing? No.

1894
01:52:14,241 --> 01:52:16,210
<i>No. What are you doing?</i>

1895
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:20,148
My mum always said it's better
to beg for forgiveness

1896
01:52:20,181 --> 01:52:21,349
<i>than ask permission.</i>

1897
01:52:21,382 --> 01:52:23,518
<i>No, you open this door.
Open the door!</i>

1898
01:52:23,551 --> 01:52:26,154
<i>Everybody thought
I was a joke,</i>

1899
01:52:27,388 --> 01:52:28,656
<i>but you listened to me</i>

1900
01:52:30,158 --> 01:52:31,292
<i>when no one else would.</i>

1901
01:52:32,293 --> 01:52:33,595
Do something for me.

1902
01:52:35,463 --> 01:52:37,232
<i>Check in on my mum.</i>

1903
01:52:39,734 --> 01:52:42,370
<i>Tell her that her son
wasn't a failure.</i>

1904
01:52:44,739 --> 01:52:46,674
<i>No. I am not
letting you do this.</i>

1905
01:52:46,708 --> 01:52:48,309
- <i>Come on.</i>
- Brian,

1906
01:52:48,343 --> 01:52:50,612
<i>you didn't kill
that astronaut.</i>

1907
01:52:51,747 --> 01:52:54,349
<i>You saved Director Fowler.</i>

1908
01:52:54,382 --> 01:52:57,285
<i>And you're not killing me now.</i>

1909
01:52:57,318 --> 01:53:00,688
<i>You're saving everyone else.</i>

1910
01:53:00,722 --> 01:53:04,325
<i>The world needs you, Brian.</i>

1911
01:53:04,359 --> 01:53:06,763
<i>You're the key
to our Moon's knowledge.</i>

1912
01:53:10,366 --> 01:53:13,269
<i>Thanks for believing
my crazy stories.</i>

1913
01:53:14,503 --> 01:53:16,105
<i>You're not crazy.</i>

1914
01:53:39,461 --> 01:53:41,865
Guys, there's something
I need to get off my chest.

1915
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,867
I'm not a real doctor.

1916
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,434
<i>I just put that
on my business cards</i>

1917
01:53:45,467 --> 01:53:46,702
<i>'cause it sounded cool.</i>

1918
01:53:46,735 --> 01:53:50,372
Go save the world,
Dr. Houseman.

1919
01:54:19,202 --> 01:54:20,805
You underestimated us.

1920
01:54:35,318 --> 01:54:36,319
Get out of here.

1921
01:54:38,688 --> 01:54:41,459
Sonny, the Moon
is going to help us.

1922
01:54:41,492 --> 01:54:42,761
Come on, try again!

1923
01:54:42,794 --> 01:54:44,830
Here it comes. Now!

1924
01:55:00,277 --> 01:55:01,545
We have incoming!

1925
01:55:36,749 --> 01:55:38,483
Come on, Bri.

1926
01:55:38,517 --> 01:55:40,285
I'm gonna get you home.

1927
01:56:06,278 --> 01:56:07,847
Sonny.

1928
01:56:09,448 --> 01:56:10,582
Sonny.

1929
01:56:18,992 --> 01:56:21,227
Thank you
for bringing him back to me.

1930
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:43,016
Mom? Is that you?

1931
01:56:45,418 --> 01:56:47,620
Yeah. They're here.
Where are you?

1932
01:56:49,455 --> 01:56:51,724
Isn't the Chrysler Building
in New York?

1933
01:57:06,908 --> 01:57:07,909
You okay?

1934
01:57:10,544 --> 01:57:12,847
Yeah. What'd I miss?

1935
01:57:12,881 --> 01:57:15,449
Well, the kids are okay.
And Earth,

1936
01:57:16,818 --> 01:57:19,386
surprisingly,
it's still in one piece.

1937
01:57:22,656 --> 01:57:24,759
You know, if Earth
gets a second chance,

1938
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:27,829
I think we deserve one, too.

1939
01:57:29,964 --> 01:57:30,965
I'd like that.

1940
01:57:36,771 --> 01:57:38,840
Is that a tracking device?

1941
01:57:38,873 --> 01:57:40,574
I sure hope so.

1942
01:57:43,845 --> 01:57:45,646
We make
a pretty good team, huh?

1943
01:57:47,614 --> 01:57:50,051
Yeah, we do.

1944
01:58:20,783 --> 01:58:22,684
Jimmy!

1945
01:58:22,717 --> 01:58:25,120
Dad!

1946
01:58:31,559 --> 01:58:33,695
We never made it to Dad.

1947
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:35,064
That's okay.

1948
01:58:40,668 --> 01:58:41,938
Where's Tom?

1949
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,575
I'm so sorry.

1950
01:58:50,512 --> 01:58:52,048
We wouldn't have made
it here without him.

1951
01:58:54,717 --> 01:58:55,752
Where's your friend?

1952
01:58:57,888 --> 01:58:59,055
He, uh...

1953
01:59:01,024 --> 01:59:03,726
He saved the world.

1954
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:05,461
And that one, too.

1955
01:59:39,096 --> 01:59:40,131
Uh...

1956
01:59:40,998 --> 01:59:42,066
Hello?

1957
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:47,537
Hello?

1958
02:00:00,017 --> 02:00:01,786
Fuzz Aldrin.

1959
02:00:04,654 --> 02:00:06,123
You did well.

1960
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:13,998
Mum.

1961
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:18,203
What is this?

1962
02:00:20,105 --> 02:00:22,140
Am I still alive?

1963
02:00:22,174 --> 02:00:24,709
We scanned your consciousness.

1964
02:00:24,742 --> 02:00:26,078
You're part of the Moon now.

1965
02:00:27,913 --> 02:00:30,182
No freakin' way.

1966
02:00:33,718 --> 02:00:34,786
So...

1967
02:00:39,257 --> 02:00:41,559
we saved the Earth.

1968
02:00:44,262 --> 02:00:46,031
We should get started.

1969
02:00:48,767 --> 02:00:50,601
Get started with what?

1970
02:00:53,806 --> 02:00:58,806
