- Come on, big foot. You got it.
- MARTIN: Okay, wow. That's...

162
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,271
(Norah laughing)

163
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,306
MARTIN:
There we go.

164
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,774
Get some light.

165
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,443
Oh, guys, don't worry
about your shoes, please.

166
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,278
Since my last girlfriend left,

167
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:24,979
I've been living
like a bachelor.

168
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:27,348
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, place is a real mess.

169
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:28,983
You'll have to excuse it.

170
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,819
- NORAH: So, um, Uncle Martin.
- Yeah?

171
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:32,554
What's your Wi-Fi password?

172
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:34,432
Just so I can, you know, like,
connect to it or something.

173
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, yeah, sorry.
We don't actually have Wi-Fi

174
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:38,259
or cell phone signal here
for the next ten days.

175
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:39,728
- What?
- What are you gonna do?

176
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,329
- No. No, no.
- MARTIN: Yeah.

177
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:42,639
- That's not fair.
- NATE: No, you'll be all right.

178
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:44,298
- MARE: Whatever.
- NORAH: What? (sighs)

179
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:45,542
MARTIN:
There's plenty to see, though.

180
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:47,534
Don't worry.
You won't miss your phone.

181
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,369
NORAH:
This is so back-in-the-day.

182
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:50,637
MARTIN (chuckling):
Yeah.

183
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:53,307
So, ladies,
you are through here.

184
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,309
Uh, sorry. I know
it doesn't look like much,

185
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:58,412
but they're more comfortable
than they look.

186
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,349
Did Mom shoot some of these?

187
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:03,984
Oh, wow. You still got these?

188
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:06,519
- Yeah, of course, man.
- Okay.

189
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:08,721
Oh. This...

190
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,891
This little bump right here,
you know who that is?

191
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:14,026
That's you.

192
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,429
♪ ♪

193
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:19,999
MARE:
These photos are amazing.

194
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:21,901
NORAH:
Wow.

195
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:23,903
MARE: Mom looks so young
and beautiful.

196
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:25,605
Where'd she shoot this one?

197
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:27,078
MARTIN:
That's just up the road here.

198
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,641
MARE:
I love this tree.

199
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:30,509
- Is that a self-portrait?
- MARTIN: Yeah.

200
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,943
She spent so much time there,

201
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,678
we actually called it
the Amahle Tree.

202
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:36,615
She loved to photograph
that thing.

203
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,784
- Can you take that salad through for us?
- Okay.

204
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:40,919
NATE:
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

205
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:42,854
Smells good. Mmm.

206
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:44,956
- Yep. It's ready, man.
- Okay.

207
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,425
(Nate chuckles)

208
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,928
All right. Where's Mare?

209
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,930
Uh, she's in there unpacking.

210
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,731
Oh. Okay.

211
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:57,668
- Hey, Mare.
- Hey.

212
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,069
Dinner's ready.

213
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:01,305
Thanks.

214
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:05,409
So, you got everything you need?

215
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:07,411
I was the one who packed
your suitcase, Dad.

216
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:08,946
Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

217
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:12,416
So, did I get everything I need?

218
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:17,420
Hey, dinner's ready, okay?

219
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,788
You just said that.

220
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:21,591
No, I know I just said that.
I just, uh...

221
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:28,974
And this is all with the...
the long exposure

222
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:30,876
- with your mom's... your mom's old Nikon?
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,101
Oh, yeah. We got to restock.

224
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:33,412
MARE: Some people think
it's old-school,

225
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:34,604
but I just prefer film.

226
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:35,972
Film is old-school,
but, I mean...

227
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,383
- I love shooting with film.
- Yeah?

228
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,108
- Yeah.
- That is really amazing.

229
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:40,742
- Thank you.
- Eh? Nate, you see this?

230
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:42,744
- Look at this work.
- NATE: Oh, yeah.

231
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:44,646
- Eh?
- No, I haven't seen that one, but, uh...

232
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,491
- It's just like your mom's stuff.
- (sighs): Yeah.

233
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:47,859
- It's actually got the same kind of soul to it.
- Yeah.

234
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:49,985
- You are really talented.
- MARE: I applied to

235
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:51,787
the Tisch School of the Arts
at NYU.

236
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,498
MARTIN: Okay, okay. Is that
a big... it's a big art school?

237
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:54,999
- MARE: Oh, is it?
- NATE: Yeah, it's a big school.

238
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:56,801
- MARE: It's the best school.
- Well, you're gonna get in.

239
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:58,603
- MARE: Thank you. I hope I do.
- MARTIN: Wow. Yeah.

240
00:11:58,627 --> 00:11:59,938
MARTIN: She's gonna get in.
Watch. Mark my words.

241
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:01,763
NATE: She didn't apply
for the medical school

242
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,741
- like Daddy wanted.
- MARTIN: No, and she shouldn't.

243
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,143
No, you shouldn't, 'cause one
doctor's enough in your family.

244
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,734
- Everything...
- NATE: What? No, look.

245
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,011
No, I-I tell her all the time
that I love her work.

246
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:09,470
She got that, um...

247
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:11,572
What is that, uh,
one that's on the fridge?

248
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,007
It's like, uh, a blue car,

249
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,751
- and there's a building in the back.
- (Norah chuckles)

250
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,745
Dad, the car is not blue.
It's red.

251
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,480
- NATE: It's not red.
- It's red.

252
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:21,449
- NATE: It's blue, right?
- It's a red car, Dad,

253
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:23,185
- and that was five years ago.
- NATE: Oh.

254
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:24,919
Sorry, I meant red.

255
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,930
- MARE: Yeah, of course you did.
- I said blue, uh, but it...

256
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,690
Okay, uh, what are you into
nowadays, young lady?

257
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:33,059
This minute, I'm thinking
about going into psychology.

258
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,861
- Mare.
- You know, family therapy, maybe.

259
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:36,897
- Hey. Mare. Mare.
- MARTIN: Probably a good idea.

260
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,199
If you got a problem, just...

261
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:39,675
- MARTIN: Come on. Nate, just...
- ...just say it.

262
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,601
My problem is that
in the last ten minutes,

263
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,770
Martin just showed more
interest in my photography

264
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:45,505
than you have in the last year.

265
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,049
- What?
- Which is the same amount of time

266
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,776
that you showed our mother
in the last year of her life.

267
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:50,911
NORAH:
Mare.

268
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,912
She got sick.

269
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,446
You missed it

270
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,790
- 'cause you had already left us.
- No, no, no.

271
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,616
- No, it's not what happened. I tried.
- Dad.

272
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,652
Your mother and I,
we mutually...

273
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:02,054
mutually agreed to separate,

274
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:03,756
- and then she got sick.
- (sighs)

275
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,791
- Norah, no, don't go.
- MARE: It's okay.

276
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:08,003
- I'll go to her, Dad.
- Come on. What are you talking about?

277
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:09,229
Norah. Hey, Norah?

278
00:13:09,262 --> 00:13:10,930
Sorry, I shouldn't have
brought this up.

279
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:12,932
Not in front of Norah.

280
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:14,866
(Nate sighs)

281
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,968
- (Martin sighs)
- MARE (distant): You okay?

282
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:19,537
Got us another bottle
before we can't stand up.

283
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,539
Ah. Always thinking ahead.

284
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:23,741
- That's what I like about you.
- (sighs): Yeah.

285
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:24,709
Okay?

286
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:28,546
In a pinch, I have been known,

287
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:30,215
- on occasion...
- Mm-hmm.

288
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:33,117
...when necessary,

289
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:36,155
to crawl around my house
on all fours

290
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:38,022
looking for another bottle.

291
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:39,823
(Nate laughing)

292
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:42,059
The house.
What a... What about the yard?

293
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:44,262
- Uh, yeah.
- What about the yard?

294
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:46,264
The garden.
Definitely the garden.

295
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:48,632
(laughing)

296
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,101
- Mmm.
- What do you got?

297
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,502
- That's a bit much.
- Too strong?

298
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:53,637
Yeah, a little strong.

299
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,839
- Lord. (laughs)
- Hey.

300
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:57,275
Cheers, man.

301
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:59,143
It's good to have you back.

302
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:01,478
(Martin groans)

303
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:06,782
(Martin sighs)

304
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:08,918
(Nate sniffs)

305
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:11,020
Can I ask you a question?

306
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,663
Why didn't you come
to the funeral?

307
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,634
Okay. Um, honestly?

308
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,771
Yeah. Why?

309
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:34,676
I... didn't want
to see her buried

310
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,846
in a concrete plot
in New York City.

311
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:43,018
I didn't...
couldn't stomach it,

312
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:44,719
and I didn't think that that's

313
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,721
what she would've wanted,
either.

314
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:50,924
Maybe we should just agree

00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:12,391
- MARTIN: Hey, boys.
- Wait.

471
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:14,959
MARTIN:
I see you, boys.

472
00:21:14,992 --> 00:21:16,661
Hello, my boys.

473
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,463
Hello.

474
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:20,432
I see you there.

475
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:22,601
Easy.

476
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:24,969
Easy, easy.

477
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:28,373
- (lion purring)
- (laughs) Okay.

478
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,541
Ah. (chuckles)

479
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:32,276
Who's a big boy, eh?

480
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:33,544
(chuckles)

481
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:35,011
Who's a big boy?

482
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,548
(grunts, chuckles)

483
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:39,417
Oh. Hey.

484
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,684
Hey. Whoa. Okay.

485
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,553
Easy, Kuda.
Don't play so rough.

486
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:44,422
Don't play so rough, my boy.

487
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:46,123
Don't play so rough.

488
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:48,958
You also want some love?
You want some love, yeah.

489
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:50,361
(chuckles)

490
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,028
(panting)

491
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,962
Hang on, hang on.
What's happened to...

492
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:56,166
What's happened to your girl?

493
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,169
What's wrong with Nandi?

494
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:02,037
- Nandi?
- (lion moaning)

495
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,640
You okay, my girl?

496
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:06,176
- (snarls, hisses)
- Okay.

497
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:08,043
Okay.

498
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,612
Just coming a little closer.

499
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:11,481
What's wrong with your paw,
girl?

500
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:13,316
(hisses)

501
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:14,651
Please, just a little bit
closer.

502
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:16,119
Let me look at you.

503
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:18,019
I just want to have a look.
Let me see.

504
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:19,455
- (growling)
- Okay. All right.

505
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:21,457
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

506
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,959
- Banji.
- Yeah?

507
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,362
- She's got a wound on her paw.
- Ah.

508
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,298
I think it's a bullet,
but I can't be sure.

509
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:31,476
I've got to get in closer, but
that's not gonna happen now,

510
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,335
so see if you can find a vet.

511
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:36,338
Okay. There's just too many
(speaks TshiVenda) now.

512
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:37,639
Yeah, probably, man.

513
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,073
What is...
(repeats TshiVenda word)

514
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:40,509
- Damn it.
- It's poachers.

515
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:43,076
- Oh.
- Illegal hunters.

516
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:46,123
- NORAH: That was really nice, Uncle Martin.
- See that?

517
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:48,616
You always got to make
a show of yourself, huh?

518
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,184
- You want to have a go?
- Me?

519
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,519
- Yeah. -No.
- Go on, Dad.

520
00:22:51,552 --> 00:22:53,321
- Try it. Just once.
- Oh, no.

521
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:55,232
You know, just hug a lion and,
uh, take a picture with Mare.

522
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:57,057
(chuckles)
My dad's not much of a hugger.

523
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,769
- No? -Nah. -What?
- More of a fist bumper.

524
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:00,294
I am a hugger.

525
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:02,330
Well, I'm gonna try
and get some help.

526
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:04,640
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you, too.

527
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:06,366
- All right, Banji.
- All right, Nate.

528
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:09,101
- Cheers, Banji.
- Uh, Dr. Nate, brother.

529
00:23:09,135 --> 00:23:10,504
(Nate chuckles)

530
00:23:10,537 --> 00:23:11,738
What happened out there?

531
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,406
She wasn't too happy.

532
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,107
Uh, it's the female.

533
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:16,543
She's got wounded.

534
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:18,245
- Wounded? How?
- (engine starts)

535
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:19,279
Poachers.

536
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:21,648
There's a Tsonga village
just up the road, guys.

537
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:23,416
Do you mind if we stop by there?

538
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,218
- No. Let's do it.
- Just want to ask people

539
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:27,521
- if they saw anything.
- Come on. -MARE: Let's go.

540
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:32,056
So you think, uh,
maybe someone at the village

541
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,325
might have seen what happened?

542
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,127
Yeah. Seen something,
heard something.

543
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,530
- (engine starts)
- Anything unusual, you know?

544
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:39,598
So, you're sure
you don't want a lion hug?

545
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:41,267
Last chance. Eh?

546
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,236
- No, I'm good.
- All right. Good.

547
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,374
MARTIN:
<i>It's getting worse and worse.</i>

548
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:49,808
<i>The poachers
used to just be after</i>

549
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:51,543
<i>the elephants and the rhinos.</i>

550
00:23:51,576 --> 00:23:53,811
Now they're actively
going after the lions.

551
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:56,247
- Why?
- They sell the teeth,

552
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:59,317
the claws, even the bones
on the black market.

553
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,818
- That's horrible.
- Yeah.

554
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:02,554
There's a market
for them now as well.

555
00:24:02,587 --> 00:24:04,556
The bones?

556
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:06,357
- Well...
- I don't know, man.

557
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:09,260
I mean, I-I've read about
the anti-poachers online,

558
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:10,862
- and they said that...
- Stop it.

559
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:12,397
- What?
- (Mare scoffs)

560
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,165
You read about
the anti-poachers online?

561
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:15,566
- Yes.
- Really?

562
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,367
And what did it say, Norah?

563
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:18,869
- Well...
- No, what did it say?

564
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:20,804
Okay. Well, they said
that people have actually

565
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:23,874
hunted down
and killed the poachers.

566
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:26,243
I mean, y-you've heard
of stories like that,

567
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:27,778
right, Uncle Martin?

568
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:29,580
- Right?
- Um, yeah.

569
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:31,882
NORAH: <i>So, are you some kind
of an anti-poacher?</i>

570
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:33,526
MARTIN: <i>I mean, we just...
we're just trying</i>

571
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,186
<i>to protect the animals

♪ ♪

574
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:09,618
Okay, so, guys, listen,
this is not a tourist village.

575
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:11,286
Okay? It's a...

576
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:13,622
It's an actual real place
where people live.

577
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,457
NORAH:
Thank you.

578
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,426
Please just be
as polite as possible.

579
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,629
Maybe get a little drink
at the bar.

580
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:22,831
- Hair of the dog?
- Oh, no.

581
00:25:22,864 --> 00:25:24,799
Mare, you can take pictures,

582
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,934
- but just ask them first, okay?
- Okay.

583
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:28,902
The Tsonga are some
of the most polite

584
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:31,238
and kind people
you'll ever meet.

585

They speak a type of Venda.

586
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:34,942
Well, Mom was actually
teaching Norah and I.

587
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:36,577
- Really?
- Before she died.

588
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:43,651
Wow, you sound good.
I like that.

589

- Hey, Norah. Look, Norah.
- (goats bleating)

595
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:01,534
- There's goats.

Hey there, buddy.

Don't they look like,
uh, dalmatian dogs?

(camera clicks) -Mare,
you can't take pictures, Mare.

601

- Doesn't matter.
- Mare, stop taking pictures.

602
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:14,813
- Why?
- Stop. Stop. Just... Shh.

603
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:16,348
They're so cute.

604
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:17,959
Do you think Uncle Martin
kills poachers?

605
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:19,584
What do you think,
Miss Know-It-All?

606
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:21,887
But that's what the article
said anti-poachers do.

607

Come on. Norah!

608
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:25,457
- What?
- You can't just wander off.

609

Come on.

610
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:28,560
Does that frighten you?

611
00:26:28,593 --> 00:26:29,661
No. (scoffs)

612
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:32,397
I have a rainbow of emotions
at my disposal, Mare.

613
00:26:32,431 --> 00:26:33,865
Well, you look scared
to me, Norah.

614
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:36,401
- I'm not scared, Mare.
- Uh-huh.

615
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:38,602
NATE:
Hey, guys. Don't walk off.

616
00:26:38,636 --> 00:26:40,438
Just stay close.

Hey, Martin.

619
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:46,911
Let's, uh...
let's get out of here, okay?

620
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:48,813
MARTIN:
Yeah, okay.

621
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:51,382
Jesus. Hang on, hang on.

622
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:52,883
- Nate, go back to the girls.
- What?

623
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:54,518
Go back to the girls right now.

624
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:56,620
- Don't let them come in here.
- (flies buzzing)

- MARE: Dad, what's going on?

00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:01,624
Uh, it's okay.
Just, uh, stay close, okay?

627
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,862
Martin?

628
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:07,397
(flies buzzing)

629
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,467
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

630
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:15,038
Guys, you got to, uh...
you got to go.

631
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:16,639
- You can't see, okay?
- What's wrong?

632
00:27:16,673 --> 00:27:18,384
I just need you to walk away
for a second, okay?

633
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:20,043
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

634
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:21,678
(goat bleating)

635
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:23,546
What happened in here?

636
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,348
MARTIN:
I have no idea, man.

637
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:31,653
Jesus Christ.
Some of them are my friends.

638
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:35,491
Shit. What did this?

639
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:38,360
Only thing that makes any sense
is a lion, but...

640
00:27:38,393 --> 00:27:40,062
- cats don't do this, you know?
- What?

641
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:41,764
Lions don't do this.

642
00:27:41,797 --> 00:27:45,667
I've heard stories, but no lion
that I've ever seen.

643
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,802
Any alive over there?

644
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,504
No.

645
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:50,838
Oh, shit.

646
00:27:50,872 --> 00:27:53,040
Most of this village
is women and kids, bro.

647
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:55,309
Think the rest of them
got away? Huh?

648
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:57,512
I hope so.

649
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,680
Okay, this is... this is bad.

650
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:00,948
With this much blood,

651
00:28:00,982 --> 00:28:02,650
there should be
hyenas around already.

652
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:04,719
What does that mean?

653
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:07,688
It means that
whatever did this is...

654
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:09,524
Still out there? Huh?

655
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,825
I'm gonna get the gun.
Go get the girls.

656
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,093
Okay. Uh, Mare!

657
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,528
- Dad.
- We got to go.

658
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:16,463
Norah. Where is your sister?

659
00:28:16,496 --> 00:28:18,331
She was playing with the goats.

660
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,833
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

661
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,501
Norah? Well, she-she...

662
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,080
- Where's Norah?
- Dad, she was just behind me.

663
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:24,571
What do you mean,
she was just...

664
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:26,083
- Norah, come on!
- Norah, we got to go, baby!

665
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:27,541
Let's go!

666
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:28,975
- Norah!
- Mare, where is she?

667
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,753
I don't know if she's hid...
I don't know where she...

668
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:32,379
- What are you talking... Norah!
- Norah!

669
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:34,080
Hey! Norah, we got to go!

670
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:35,481
Norah, come on!

671
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,949
You had one job, Mare.

672
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,417
That's all.
Look after your sister.

673

Go check over there.
Go check over there.

- Norah!

Norah, can you hear me?

678
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,628

Shit.

Norah!

00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,978
- Where you at?
- NORAH: Dad!

687

Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, baby.

688
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,481
You okay? You okay?
Are you hurt?

689
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,859
- Are you hurt? Huh?
- (gasping, whimpering)

690
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,084
Look at me, look at me. Okay.

a situation in the village.

We're gonna be fine. Norah.

The mountain blocks

There's a seasonal outpost
about six K's up the road here,

702
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:41,745
so I'm just gonna go down there

No, we're gonna go home,

Call whoever you got to
when we get back.

Listen, there's like 15
families in that village, okay?

How many? (speaks TshiVenda)

722
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:20,216
He's from the village.
He needs help.

He'll be fine.
Just stay in the car.

- Wha-What?

751

- What? Was it a lion?
- Martin said there was

752

...find someone on the radio.

760
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:26,654
Okay, but Martin said that
we're out of range here.

761
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:27,922
I don't care what Martin said.
Try.

Dad, what do I say? Dad!

- Um, just tell them that...
- Dad, what...

765
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:34,595
Tell them that we're outside
Tsonga village, all right?

- Tsonga village. Okay.
- Two miles on the road.

767
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:38,124
We got a injured male.
Tell them...

768

Yeah, look, no, Mutende, he...
he didn't make it, okay?

He didn't make it,

Hey, man, I don't know
what to do right now.

905
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,994
Okay? I don't know what to do.

Okay, you-you want to just,
um, stay there.

907
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:46,066
Someone will come.

908
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,102
And, uh, stay in the car.

909
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:52,239
I'm-I'm seeing...
I'm seeing, uh, st...

910
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,176
Whew. I'm seeing stars, man,
feeling dizzy.

911
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,010
Hey, Martin, listen to me.

912
00:38:58,043 --> 00:39:01,181
Um, you're gonna go into shock,
all right?

913
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,682
I need you to stop the bleeding.

914
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,093
- Mare, is he okay?
- Yeah. He's gonna be okay.

915
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:05,419
Needless to say, all right?

916
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:07,154
I need you to take
your belt off, uh...

917
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:08,988
uh, wrap it around your leg,

918
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:11,424
and I need you to pull
that shit tight.

919
00:39:11,457 --> 00:39:15,026
I did that already, but, um,
it's not really helping.

920
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,662
I've... I...
He went really deep, man.

921
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:18,431
It's all the way to the bone.

922
00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:20,199
Y-You did that? Okay. Okay.

923
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,234
Um, do you have
your lighter on you?

924
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:23,536
That Zippo?

925
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,638
Uh, yeah, yeah. Yes.

926
00:39:25,671 --> 00:39:27,573
You got that?
All right, do me a favor.

927
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:29,175
Take your knife out, all right?

928
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:31,042
You're not gonna like me
for this, man,

929
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:33,746
but I need you to heat that
knife as hot as it can get.

930
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:35,447
It needs to be
as hot as Hades, man.

931
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,215
Then you need to put it
on the artery.

932
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:39,049
All right? And you need
to lay it on there

933
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,318
while it's really hot.

934
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:41,729
All right?
We're gonna stop the bleeding.

935
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:43,130
How much time?
We need to go get him.

936
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:44,289

It's the only man-made thing...

1088
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:52,317
It's on stilts.

1089
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,018
The only man-made thing
on stilts, Dad.

1090
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:56,287
Uh...

1091

Hold on. I don't see it.

I don't see it. Uh...

1097
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:06,930
Dad, Dad, it's right there!

1105
00:45:17,808 --> 00:45:19,476
I'm gonna check
if I can see Uncle Martin.

1106
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,854
- Get back in the car right now.
- Mare! Mare!

1107
00:45:20,878 --> 00:45:22,689
No, we have to do something,
or he's gonna die.

1108
00:45:22,713 --> 00:45:24,058

NATE: I'll do it!
Get back in the car!

Hurry up!

1145
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:57,737

00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,122
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you
back to the cruiser, okay?

1150
00:47:07,146 --> 00:47:08,580
I told you to stay in the car.

1151
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:10,582

00:47:55,592 --> 00:47:56,927
- Good job. Good job.
- Thank you.

1166
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,529
Close the window. Okay?
Close the window.

1167
00:48:01,132 --> 00:48:02,933
Hey, Mare!

1168
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:04,201
Mare, come back!

1169
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:06,703
Hey, Mare, can you hear me?

1170
00:48:07,704 --> 00:48:09,673
I'll get your sister, okay?
Stay right there.

1171
00:48:09,706 --> 00:48:11,242
Hey, Mare, can you hear me?

1172
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:12,809
Dad? Norah?

Martin, you okay?

1176
00:48:17,613 --> 00:48:19,149
Yeah, we're fine.
Are you guys okay?

1177
00:48:19,182 --> 00:48:20,549
What happened to the lion?

1178
00:48:20,582 --> 00:48:22,551
Your sister stuck a dart
in his ass.

1179
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:23,686
MARE:
She did?

Yeah, she sure did.

1185
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:36,732
- It's okay, Uncle Martin.
- Okay.

1186
00:48:36,765 --> 00:48:38,167
- I think I got it.
- It's okay.

1187
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,701
I think I got it. Hey, Mare.

1188
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:41,803
Uh, Mare, can you pass
the tweezers right there?

1189
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,580
- Uh-huh. Which one?
- I need... Yep, yep, that one.

1190
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:45,107
I want you to clamp this
right here.

1191
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,574
Hold on tight and do not let go.

1192
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:47,976
Do you understand?

1193
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,687
All right. Uh, Norah,
can you check in that box...

1194
00:48:49,711 --> 00:48:51,588
The aid box... if they got
some sutures in there?

1195
00:48:51,612 --> 00:48:52,947
Can you tell me what they got?

1196
00:48:52,981 --> 00:48:55,250
- Uh, there's, uh, nylon...
- What do they have?

1197
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:57,719
- ...silk and polypropylene.
- Okay, man.

1198
00:48:57,752 --> 00:48:59,587
Okay, give me
a 16-millimeter silk.

1199
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,265
- Um, there's 3/018-millimeter silk.
- Good job.

1200
00:49:01,289 --> 00:49:03,257
All right, it's not perfect
but will do.

1201
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:05,293
- Are your hands clean?
- Definitely not.

1202
00:49:05,326 --> 00:49:06,860
Take a-a alcohol swab,
wipe your hands,

1203
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:09,097
and then, uh,
pass the, uh, suture packet

1204
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:10,764
with the needle up, okay?

1205
00:49:10,797 --> 00:49:12,866
- Okay.
- NATE: Okay, Mare. You okay?

1206
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:14,278
- All right.
- MARE: He's bleeding out a lot.

1207
00:49:14,302 --> 00:49:15,769
It's gonna be all...
I know. I know.

1208
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:17,281
Just relax, okay?
How you doing, Norah?

1209
00:49:17,305 --> 00:49:18,972
Okay.

1210
00:49:19,006 --> 00:49:20,583
All right, he's gonna pass out
in a second, all right?

1211
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:22,152
- He's gonna be all right. All right?
- Yeah.

1212
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:23,253
There you go.
No, turn it around.

1213
00:49:23,277 --> 00:49:24,910
Turn it around for me.

1214
00:49:24,944 --> 00:49:26,146
Good job.

1215
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:27,613

I got it. I got it.

- Did a good job, okay?

1222
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,568
- Good job.
- What about the lion?

1223
00:49:50,602 --> 00:49:51,870
Martin said the tranquilizer

1224
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:53,705
would keep him out
for a couple of hours.

1225
00:49:53,738 --> 00:49:55,174
We'll be long gone by then.

1226
00:49:55,207 --> 00:49:56,808
But it's the same lion,
isn't it?

1227
00:49:56,841 --> 00:49:59,611
The one that killed all
those people in the village?

1228
00:50:00,312 --> 00:50:02,714
It has to be.

1229
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:06,185
Norah, are you sure you put
a dart in that thing?

1230
00:50:06,218 --> 00:50:07,353

wearing off already.

00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:17,928
All right. Don't panic, okay?

he'd be out for hours.

I just need a ride out of here.

- A lion.

1420
00:59:26,454 --> 00:59:28,523
It was huge. It took out
the-the whole village.

1421

That's the big male
that got away.

1422

you guys are poachers, right?

Poachers like
that we saw last night?

No. Yes, but they're not

- Okay.
