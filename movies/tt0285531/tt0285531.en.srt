2
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:54,552
Carl's Jr. has this $6 burger,
which really only costs $3.95...

3
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,929
so you think you're
getting some deal...

4
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,267
but the truth is, it may be the
best franchise burger out there.

5
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:04,771
I went there yesterday
and ordered three.

6
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:08,107
By golly, those suckers
almost filled me up.

7
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:12,487
When I got home, I still had
to have a box of Eggos...

8
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:15,698
but that doesn't take away
from Carl's achievement.

9
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,659
I mean, here's a guy
who's got to go...

10
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,703
- ...through life as Carl Junior, right?
- Barry?

11
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,708
Like he can never get out of the shadow
of his dad, the original Carl, I guess.

12
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,712
Do you think this compulsive eating has to
do with thinking you killed your mother?

13
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:33,100
That you're eating yourself
to death as punishment?

14
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:38,137
- You do think you killed her, right?
- I never said that.

15
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:41,265
She called out to you from
that big, fancy oak bed.

16
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:44,936
- She said she was having chest pain.
- I never told you any of that!

17
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:48,481
- How could you know this?
- She begged you to dial 911.

18
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:52,581
But she was always calling out
for you, wasn't she, Barry?

19
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:58,336
You weren't there. How could
you know what happened? How?

20
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:04,831
- Doesn't matter. Stop blaming yourself.
- Doesn't matter.

21
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:08,402
If you don't, you'll eat yourself
into an early grave for no reason.

22
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:11,212
You're looking in my head! Stop it!

23
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:14,632
- Don't look in there.
- You don't have to do it, Barry.

24
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,431
Leave me alone!

25
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:20,688
It wasn't your fault.

26
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:09,113
Jonesy?

27
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:24,628
Ah!

28
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,421
Hey, how are you doing, Henry?

29
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,006
What's that you say?

30
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,133
Are you going deaf?
How are you doing?

31
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:42,845
You know. SSDD.

32
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:44,597
Well, yeah, of course.

33
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:49,394
Hey, I was thinking if you were free
this weekend we might go see Duddits.

34
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:53,106
Yeah, absolutely. He's
been on my mind a lot too.

35
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:55,316
It's been a long time.

36
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,910
Yeah. It's open!

37
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,533
I gotta go. I got a thing here.
I'll see you Saturday.

38
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:05,165
Yeah, right.

39
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:18,311
See you Saturday.

40
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:22,057
So, Mr. Defuniak...

41
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:26,231
do you know we're both
escapees from Maine?

42
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:31,569
You're from Pittsfield.

43
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:42,956
Know what happens to scholarship
students caught cheating on exams?

44
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,260
You had the flu that day, didn't you,
David? You didn't take the exam?

45
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,262
You missed the test. And since you were
ill, why not write me an essay instead?

46
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:09,557
3000 words on the short-term
results of the Norman Conquest.

47
00:07:09,558 --> 00:07:11,517
- Go get started.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:14,187
Better to be from Pittsfield
than go back to it.

49
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:16,531
Thank you, sir.

50
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,122
How did you know?
You weren't even there that day.

51
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,625
Sometimes I just know.

52
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:49,488
Hello.

53
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:55,687
This probably won't work.

54
00:07:55,688 --> 00:08:00,024
Never start like that with a car salesman.
We love challenges. Pete Moore.

55
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:03,903
In one hour I'm showing a house in
Fryeburg. It's a big commission.

56
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:07,907
And I just lost my damn car keys.
Could you possibly make me duplicates?

57
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:11,452
- That takes at least a day.
- Oh, boy, I just knew it!

58
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:15,248
Easy, Trish. Maybe I can help.
I'm always good at finding things.

59
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:20,060
- Did I say my name? I don't remember...
- I guessed.

60
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:24,016
Now, let's find those keys.

61
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:26,801
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey, Pete.

62
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:30,638
- I looked again. I couldn't find them.
- Okay. I need your help.

63
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,599
You had the coffee in your
hand, bought aspirin...

64
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,436
went to your car, realized
the keys were gone.

65
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,697
- That everything?
- Yes.

66
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:45,867
Look. This is gonna seem weird, but
it's just a thing I do to help me think.

67
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:01,889
You bought a candy bar
before the aspirin.

68
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:09,356
Mars bar.

69
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:17,237
Yours, right?

70
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,612
One more question. If I find your
keys, will you let me buy you dinner?

71
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:29,364
West Wharf? 6:30?

72
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:32,950
Best fried clams in the state?
It's right on your way back.

73
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:35,840
Sure. Okay.

74
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:39,923
- That'd be nice.
- All right.

75
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:43,753
So you got here.
You opened your purse.

76
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:47,965
Coffee, candy and aspirin,
you're juggling it all around.

77
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:50,109
And that's when...

78
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,525
you dropped your keys.

79
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:02,036
It's just luck, is all.

80
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:08,119
Thank you.

81
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:22,095
- West Wharf, right? Half past six?
- You got it.

82
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:35,109
Another fuckarow.

83
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:18,931
- Jones.
- How are you doing?

84
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:23,936
- Hey, Beaver. Same shit, different day.
- Same shit, different day.

85
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:28,405
- Wanna talk?
- No, you're trying to get home.

86
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:32,653
- What's up?
- Really, I got nothing. Go home.

87
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:37,122
- Wait, Jonesy?
- Yeah, Beav?

88
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:42,262
- You be careful.
- Be careful of what?

89
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,391
Wish I knew.

90
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:17,156
Oh, my gosh. He's right there. Yeah.

91
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:19,549
What did you say?

92
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:21,995
I didn't say anything.

93
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:24,754
Right. Sorry.

94
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:32,213
Hey!

95
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,972
Oh, my God!

96
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,760
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, look!

97
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:44,517
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- It won't do any good.

98
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:49,689
I looked away for one second. Then
I heard a thump. What happened?

99
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,151
- Careful, careful.
- Back up, back up.

100
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:57,405
- Seriously....
- My God! Professor Jones!

101
00:12:57,406 --> 00:13:01,956
I just saw him. He can't die!

102
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:05,413
Is he dead?

103
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:10,308
I didn't see it. Why did he run out?

104
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:12,936
Clear!

105
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:16,716
No good. Flatline. Hit it again!

106
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:18,343
Clear!

107
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:23,190
- What do you think?
- I think it's no good. I think he's gone.

108
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:27,784
Watch out for Ister Gay.

109
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:02,694
Out of my way.

110
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,057
Jonesy, don't try
to lift that stuff.

111
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:11,145
- Just go up to the cabin.
- Here, here, look. Big jacket.

112
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:13,981
- Beaver, I'm going in!
- I'll see you in a second!

113
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:17,701
Watch the beer.

114
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:31,256
- Got blown last night.
- Good for you.

115
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:35,142
- First time?
- Bite my bag.

116
00:14:35,963 --> 00:14:40,133
Met some lady at bingo, went back to
her place, turned into a nice fuckaree.

117
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:43,636
- As opposed to a fuckarow.
- Obviously.

118
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:48,182
Though I've had perfectly good fuckarees
turn into fuckarows in a flash.

119
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:50,685
- Try Viagra.
- Viagra?

120
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:53,563
I'm practically at
full salute all day.

121
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:57,567
I'm.... What do
you call it? Privatic?

122
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:00,194
Prag... Prasmatic? Henry will know.

123
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:03,489
- You're thinking of fourth grade.
- You're having wood problems?

124
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,825
- You haven't tried it, have you?
- Hell, no!

125
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:11,633
Drop that little blue bomb, you're hard
as a Louisville Slugger for 12 hours.

126
00:15:11,874 --> 00:15:13,124
Twelve hours?

127
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:17,045
I'm talking Yastrzemski. You don't
have to need it to love it.

128
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:21,311
Bingo? Did you say bingo,
like the game in church basements?

129
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:24,599
- There's trim there.
- Beaver!

130
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:27,775
I thought my deal was pathetic.

131
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:35,063
- Ah!
- You just watch. That's your job.

132
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:37,490
- I'm fine.
- Uh-huh.

133
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:42,695
H, you been thinking about
Duddits more than usual?

134
00:15:42,696 --> 00:15:44,921
Uh-huh.

135
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:47,700
Remember we were gonna
go see him that weekend?

136
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:51,136
- I remember.
- Then I got hit.

137
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,544
I gotta tell you something weird.

138
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:04,484
The night I got hit, I was standing there
and across the street, I saw Duddits.

139
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:08,054
Just like he was that day we
first saw him back in Derry.

140
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:11,599
He was calling out for help and
everyone was ignoring him.

141
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,534
Then he looked over at me.
He looked directly at me.

142
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:19,283
And he motioned for
me to come to him.

143
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:29,539
You believe I saw him, don't you?

144
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,550
Yes, sir, I do.

145
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:38,345
Duddits loves me, I know that.
He loves us all.

146
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:44,524
He would die before
he'd ever hurt us.

147
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:48,653
So why was he calling me
into the street to get hit?

148
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:53,943
Maybe there's more to the
story we don't get yet.

149
00:16:58,105 --> 00:16:59,939
- You don't know shit.
- Name it!

150
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,443
I'll name it after we come
up with a small wager.

151
00:17:03,444 --> 00:17:05,111
- 50 bucks.
- What's the subject?

152
00:17:05,112 --> 00:17:08,156
In the movies, when people
wake up together...

153
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:11,117
they immediately start
kissing and going at it.

154
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:15,413
But they never get up first, take a
leak and brush their goddamn teeth.

155
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:18,958
Which is pretty much
necessary when you wake up.

156
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,794
What's it called when you
got a constant woody?

157
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:25,131
- You mean priapism.
- See? I'm practically priasmic.

158
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:26,758
Priapismic.

159
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,844
- Whatever! It's hard.
- That's what you're betting on?

160
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:35,308
I can name the one movie where they
acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life.

161
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:39,823
- I'll give you a quarter.
- A quarter from you. 50 bucks from you.

162
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:45,151
- Promised Land.
- Promised Land? Never heard of it.

163
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:48,321
Meg Ryan and what's his name?
Reefer Sutherland.

164
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:51,366
- Kiefer.
- From, I don't know, 1988 or something?

165
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:54,994
So Meg Ryan wakes up in the morning
and says, "Where's the cat?"

166
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:59,260
And he says, "What cat?" And she says,
"The cat that shit in my mouth."

167
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,126
That will be 50 small.

168
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:05,004
- Bullshit! You made it up.
- Could Beaver make that up?

169
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:08,966
You can have that priceless piece
of cinematic trivia absolutely free.

170
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:12,845
I'm filing that in the "Who-gives-a-shit"
section of my memory warehouse.

171
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:18,017
- What's the memory warehouse?
- You don't remember?

172
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:20,937
- I must've forgot.
- You forgot the memory warehouse?

173
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:24,857
- Just remind me. Don't give me shit.
- It's in his head. We've all got one.

174
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:27,276
- Hasn't that place been condemned?
- Not yet.

175
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:31,531
It's so crowded I throw something out
every time I learn something new.

176
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:36,628
When I got my new laptop I had to
throw out my files of rock 'n' roll lyrics.

177
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:44,377
My warehouse was washed away
in a flood about 10 years ago.

178
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,546
I didn't know they had enough beer.

179
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:48,881
Hey. Hey, hey.

180
00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:53,183
Jonesy, if that really
is your name...

181
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:58,655
- ...what do you do with the old files?
- I burn them.

182
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:41,225
- You threw out the "Blue Bayou" lyrics?
- No.

183
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:43,603
No, if I really can't
let go of something...

184
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:47,205
I sneak it back to an office
where I keep my secret stuff.

185
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:07,460
Where do you keep the
stuff on Duddits?

186
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:11,964
He's got a special section all
his own on the third level.

187
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:15,899
I can't stop thinking about the
Duds lately. How about you guys?

188
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:20,270
It's this place. He's all around here,
even though he's never been here.

189
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:26,104
This is our 20th year coming
out here to Hole in the Wall.

190
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:28,815
And fuck me, Freddy,
here's to 20 more.

191
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,733
Yeah.

192
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:32,615
Twenty more.

193
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:37,073
Here's to Duddits...

194
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:39,117
our dreamcatcher.

195
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:41,327
Wish he was here.

196
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:42,745
To the Duds.

197
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:46,264
- To Douglas Cavell.
- To Duddits.

198
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:57,260
Why is Tina Schlossinger's pussy
on the wall of Tracker Brothers?

199
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:59,846
Because I said so. It's a picture.

200
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,806
- Have you seen it?
- No...

201
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,684
but the kid who sits behind
me in shop, he saw it.

202
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:06,811
Tracker Brothers is
deserted for years.

203
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:09,472
You don't want to see the
homecoming queen's pussy?

204
00:21:09,473 --> 00:21:11,636
Don't come.

205
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:15,445
Fuck me, Freddy! Some kid's shirt.

206
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:19,130
- So?
- It's new!

207
00:21:23,037 --> 00:21:25,546
Scooby-Doo.

208
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:28,291
"I belong to Douglas Cavell."

209
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:33,755
"If the boy I belong to is lost, please
bring him to 19 Maple Lane, Derry."

210
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:37,258
Must belong to one of those
kids from the Retard Academy.

211
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:43,598
Come on. Eat it. Eat it.
Eat it and you can go.

212
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,859
Hey, you guys! Quit it!

213
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:48,236
Just fucking quit it!

214
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:50,730
What are you doing?

215
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:54,150
You're trying to make him eat that?
What's wrong with you?

216
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:57,362
Got it. I'll make him eat this
dog turd, then he can go.

217
00:21:57,363 --> 00:22:00,073
You go now. Unless you want half.

218
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:02,784
Take a hike, girls, while
you have the chance.

219
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:05,411
Piss off. That's your final warning.

220
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:10,667
- You better watch it!
- Why is that?

221
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:13,544
- I know who you are.
- I'm trembling with fear.

222
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:16,589
- You're Rich Grenadeau, the quarterback!
- So?

223
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,689
What will people say when we tell
them what we caught you doing?

224
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:24,605
You won't tell anybody anything
because you'll be dead.

225
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:28,935
- Get ready, Pete.
- Give the word, Henry.

226
00:22:28,936 --> 00:22:33,368
Pete can fly. When you come for us,
all we have to do is get in your way.

227
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,274
I can't catch that little dick?

228
00:22:35,275 --> 00:22:39,291
You know who that is?
That's Pete Moore.

229
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:43,449
That's right, fat-ass. Pete Moore.
No one can catch him.

230
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,661
He's going straight to his
house to tell his mother.

231
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:49,551
She'll call the cops
and then we'll see.

232
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,125
- You know him, is that it?
- Never saw him.

233
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:56,921
Then why ask for trouble?
I mean, look at this moron!

234
00:22:56,922 --> 00:23:00,689
- He likes this attention.
- How do you know what he likes?

235
00:23:03,637 --> 00:23:05,612
Come on, you dickweeds!

236
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:09,892
- You want to fight us?
- Yes! Yes!

237
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:11,936
I'm gone, Henry. Just say the word.

238
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:15,940
- Why? You'll lose! Why?
- Because you can't do that! It's wrong!

239
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:18,913
And I'm gonna tell the world!
Tell everybody!

240
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,379
- You want us to leave, is that it?
- No! Let's kick their asses!

241
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:36,002
Let's go. We'll get him later.
You know that.

242
00:23:36,003 --> 00:23:38,477
Get you all later.

243
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:51,952
It's okay. You can stop now.

244
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,072
Do something. Somebody!

245
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:57,449
If I do...

246
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:04,297
and you tell anybody, I'll never
hang with you guys again.

247
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:28,688
I never knew Beav could sing.

248
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:37,855
- Beaver, that's beautiful.
- I mean it. Not one word.

249
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:39,857
Beaver!

250
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:42,498
You've got a fan.

251
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,201
This yours?

252
00:24:58,335 --> 00:25:02,055
Douglas Cavell. That's
your name, right?

253
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,924
I Duddits.

254
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:08,136
- What?
- I Duddits!

255
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:10,972
- Duddits?
- Duddits.

256
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:13,565
Duddits, we got to get you home.

257
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:28,336
Hey, guys! Come here!
Leave the kid there.

258
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:32,423
Stand right here, Duddits.
Right here with Scooby, okay?

259
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,307
Jesus Christ bananas!

260
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:57,143
No way is that Tina
Jean Schlossinger.

261
00:25:57,144 --> 00:26:00,229
Maybe her grandmother.
Good going, Beav.

262
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,034
Holy God. We came all the
way here just for that?

263
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:08,701
No. We came for him.

264
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:37,403
Hey, Pete. You forgot the dogs.

265
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:42,021
Uh-oh. Weather moving in.
Double storm.

266
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:46,025
Alberta Clipper first,
maybe 8 inches...

267
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:48,702
with a nor'easter on its tail.

268
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,950
- Get on back to the cabin, Henry.
- Heading straight there, Mr. G.

269
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:56,342
- Don't mess around.
- No, sir.

270
00:28:44,645 --> 00:28:46,270
Easy, fella.

271
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:50,149
Easy. You're okay. You're all right.

272
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,610
Thank God. Thank God.

273
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:56,364
Gee, thank God!

274
00:28:56,365 --> 00:29:00,034
I'm lost. I've been lost in
the woods since yesterday.

275
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:04,218
Let's get you inside. Get you warm.

276
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,509
- How would that be?
- Sure.

277
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:24,650
Here, let me get that.

278
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:33,776
- Rick McCarthy.
- Gary Jones. It's Jonesy to everybody.

279
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:38,614
Our damn cell phones are on the
blink now, so I can't call for help...

280
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:40,575
but our car will be back soon.

281
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:45,754
I didn't think I'd make it.
I lost the folks I was with.

282
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:49,552
You saved me, that's for sure.

283
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:52,514
What's that?

284
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,854
It's a dreamcatcher.

285
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:01,346
Indian charm. Catches nightmares...

286
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:04,432
keeps them away.
Keeps you safe down here.

287
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:07,026
I've had enough nightmares.

288
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:13,825
Been doing that all night.

289
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,952
I ate some berries in the dark.

290
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:21,967
I think they must have upset me.

291
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:47,100
I know what you're thinking.

292
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:51,938
Anyone who drinks at 11 a.m. needs
to take the cure, but I only do it here.

293
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:54,774
In the real world, I never
drink till after 5:00...

294
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:58,162
and if it ever does,
I'm on the wagon for life.

295
00:30:58,195 --> 00:30:59,910
Glad to hear it.

296
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:05,002
What's the matter with you?

297
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:09,747
About six months ago,
the day Jonesy got hit...

298
00:31:09,748 --> 00:31:15,628
I did something terrible with a patient.
I humiliated him. Drove him out.

299
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:18,131
Barry Neiman.

300
00:31:18,132 --> 00:31:22,860
Couple days ago, I saw his picture in
the paper. He ate himself to death.

301
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:27,890
Mind if I don't use that story next
time I'm trying to sell a Mustang?

302
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:32,812
You were a lead balloon long before this
porker munched his way to eternity.

303
00:31:32,813 --> 00:31:37,956
Thanks. You're a real comfort.
You got a real delicate touch to you.

304
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,918
Here you go, Rick, buddy.
That will fix you up.

305
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:55,641
Jesus Christ bananas! Some
fuckarow this is turning into!

306
00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:00,673
- Thanks a lot, Beav.
- Yeah, I think I got it all.

307
00:32:00,674 --> 00:32:03,101
What happened to you?

308
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:10,058
Hi. Joe Clarendon. Call me Beaver.

309
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:12,352
Rick here had a bad
night in the woods.

310
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:14,062
Welcome.

311
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:17,648
- Is that frostbite?
- No, I get the same thing from peanuts.

312
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,329
It's allergy.

313
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:23,446
Grilled cheese, anyone?

314
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:28,673
- No, the soup's fine for me.
- I'll bite. Sail it over here.

315
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:34,082
My mother used to feed me pea
soup when I was feeling...

316
00:32:37,336 --> 00:32:39,379
Bitch in a buzz saw!

317
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,216
I've heard some mighty burps in my
time, but that's the blue ribbon.

318
00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:44,634
I am so embarrassed.

319
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:47,762
- Rick ate some berries in the woods.
- Oh, no.

320
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:53,779
Oh, my God!

321
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:56,604
Oh, my God, that's awful!

322
00:32:56,605 --> 00:32:57,897
I'm so sorry!

323
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:01,984
Rick, buddy, don't worry about it.
There's more room out than in, anyway.

324
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:05,456
What have you been
eating, woodchuck turds?

325
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:09,670
Know what I think?

326
00:33:09,785 --> 00:33:13,884
I think you need to lie down
and take you a little nap.

327
00:33:14,206 --> 00:33:16,749
You know, I bet you're right.

328
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,892
I'm just tired, that's all.

329
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:22,224
- Come on.
- My hat.

330
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:24,977
Beaver?

331
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:29,688
Come on. In here.

332
00:33:33,434 --> 00:33:36,436
Thank you for taking me in.
Thank you both.

333
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:40,904
- Shit, anybody would have.
- Maybe. Maybe not.

334
00:33:40,983 --> 00:33:43,401
All right, this is in
case you have to urk...

335
00:33:43,402 --> 00:33:47,238
if you can't get to the bathroom,
which is the third door to your left.

336
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:50,783
If you go in the first,
you'll take a shit in the closet.

337
00:33:50,784 --> 00:33:53,424
If you need anything, we're outside.

338
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:09,635
Fuck me, give me some air!

339
00:34:09,636 --> 00:34:12,972
We got any gas masks handy?
We need a biohazard team in here.

340
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:18,728
- Wanna hear what'll freak you out more?
- Not really.

341
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:20,438
You know his huge stomach?

342
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:24,942
When he got here, his stomach was
normal, but his chest was out to here!

343
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:26,569
I wish Henry was here.

344
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,488
He's a shrink, not an internist.

345
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:32,208
He went to med school. Did you?

346
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,587
I thought about it.

347
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:51,734
You better get a run at it.

348
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:03,022
- Shit!
- Watch it!

349
00:35:03,023 --> 00:35:04,821
What the hell?

350
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:37,390
- Pete, are you okay?
- I broke my leg! My damn leg!

351
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:40,560
- Okay. Hang on. Hang on a second.
- Help me!

352
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:43,367
- I'm caught! I can't...
- God!

353
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:55,783
- God.
- Henry! A little help here!

354
00:35:55,784 --> 00:35:58,036
Hang on, Pete. Hang on.

355
00:35:58,037 --> 00:36:02,290
- Okay. Here comes the seat belt.
- I just opened that beer.

356
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:06,267
I got you.

357
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:20,114
How's your leg?

358
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:25,863
Well, it ain't broken.
It's just locked up, is all.

359
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:47,960
You don't suppose he got
exposed to radiation?

360
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:52,423
I saw that once in a movie. Guy ended
up bald as Telly what's-his-fuck.

361
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:57,485
This guy's got plenty of hair. But that
red mark got bigger while I watched it.

362
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:04,984
- What are you doing?
- Peanut butter calms me down.

363
00:37:05,062 --> 00:37:09,612
- Somebody else might want to use that.
- I'll leave some.

364
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:13,162
Beav.

365
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:16,082
Beaver.

366
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:23,175
Criminettlies!

367
00:37:39,346 --> 00:37:41,820
I think it's a woman.

368
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:45,727
I ought to warn you.
I'm gonna strangle this broad.

369
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:48,813
- I'd guess she's already dead.
- I'll strangle her anyway.

370
00:37:48,814 --> 00:37:51,454
She almost got us both killed.

371
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:56,292
Hello! Here we come, ma'am.
Don't be startled.

372
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:07,383
Hello?

373
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:12,050
Forget it, H. She's gone.

374
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:16,299
Hello!

375
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:24,557
Ma'am, can you hear me?
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

376
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:31,064
I wonder if maybe that's how
they say hello around here.

377
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:35,497
Listen, Miss Road Kill,
you almost got us dead.

378
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:38,537
Say something.

379
00:38:38,947 --> 00:38:42,548
I have to find Rick.

380
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:48,175
- Okay.
- Rick.

381
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:54,435
Yeah.

382
00:38:55,255 --> 00:38:58,263
Fuck me, Freddy.

383
00:39:04,098 --> 00:39:08,601
- What's all that red stuff on their fur?
- Just like McCarthy's cheek.

384
00:39:08,602 --> 00:39:12,814
- I never saw anything like this before.
- Even the bears look scared.

385
00:39:12,815 --> 00:39:16,484
- Of what? Where are they going?
- It's not where that worries me...

386
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,445
it's what are they
running away from?

387
00:39:27,454 --> 00:39:29,383
What the hell?

388
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,585
This could be perfect. They
can get Stinky to a hospital.

389
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:36,385
Hey, you guys!

390
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,094
We need help! Got a sick guy inside!

391
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:45,680
This area is under
temporary quarantine.

392
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:48,266
- Stay where you are.
- What quarantine?

393
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:52,812
- We got a sick guy down here!
- We need your help here!

394
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:56,315
- We got a real sick guy!
- Take him with you now!

395
00:39:56,316 --> 00:40:02,041
Glad you're okay. This situation
will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours.

396
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:06,257
Kiss my bender!

397
00:40:30,684 --> 00:40:34,395
I gotta ask you, old buddy.
Because I'm confused.

398
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:38,900
- Is this SSDD or not?
- Definitely not.

399
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:40,735
Different shit today, Pete.

400
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:44,530
And a pretty weird day so
far, if you want to know.

401
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:46,908
Over here.

402
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:53,049
Okay. There you go.

403
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,999
Easy.

404
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,006
Nine miles to Hole in the Wall.

405
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,977
I think I can manage it.

406
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:09,055
I'll bring the snowmobile
back and get you both.

407
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:13,226
Now, Pete, you listen to me.
Don't go back to the car for beer.

408
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:19,248
- Stay with her. Keep her warm.
- Right hand to God, Dr. D.

409
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,817
Henry!

410
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:23,659
If we die before you get back...

411
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:27,706
promise you'll tell everybody
she wasn't my date.

412
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,126
- I don't like this.
- Me neither.

413
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:39,335
Not at all.

414
00:41:39,336 --> 00:41:44,230
This is turning into a double
fuckarow. A real jobba-nobba.

415
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:54,786
- Rick, you okay?
- I'm a little sick, fellas.

416
00:42:54,787 --> 00:42:59,082
- I just need to make a little room.
- McCarthy, Rick, open up, man.

417
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:02,001
- Go away!
- Open the door or we break it down.

418
00:43:02,002 --> 00:43:05,838
- Can't a man have privacy?
- Rick, where are you bleeding from?

419
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,891
Bleeding? I'm not bleeding.

420
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:16,099
- Let's do it.
- I'm not positive I wanna go in there.

421
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:20,561
What if he's dying? Scooby-Dooby-Doo,
we got some work to do now.

422
00:43:20,562 --> 00:43:23,439
On three. Ready?

423
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,456
One.... Two....

424
00:43:27,528 --> 00:43:30,963
Hold it! What if we just bounce off?

425
00:43:32,032 --> 00:43:36,582
- No bounce, no play.
- Right. No bounce, no play.

426
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:38,830
One....

427
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:42,800
And a two.... Three!

428
00:43:49,842 --> 00:43:53,177
Oh, fuck! Oh, man! Fuck!

429
00:43:53,178 --> 00:43:55,805
I don't want to see this!
I can't see this.

430
00:43:55,806 --> 00:43:59,559
- Shut up a minute. Mr. McCarthy? Rick?
- Is he still alive?

431
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,519
I don't know. Rick?
Rick, are you...?

432
00:44:03,313 --> 00:44:07,191
Oh, man! Jonesy, if he can still
do that, he must be alive.

433
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:09,444
Can you hear me? I think he's dead.

434
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:11,904
Bullshit! He dropped
a clinker! I heard it.

435
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:16,088
- I don't think that was a clinker.
- That's enough, snap out of it!

436
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:18,870
- Oh, my God!
- My God!

437
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,208
- No!
- No?

438
00:44:24,209 --> 00:44:25,841
No.

439
00:44:27,421 --> 00:44:32,517
Good move! It's trapped. Got
nowhere to go but the septic tank.

440
00:44:51,445 --> 00:44:53,160
Okay.

441
00:44:57,201 --> 00:44:59,535
Oh, shit!

442
00:44:59,536 --> 00:45:03,122
- Listen, we're gonna change places.
- What?

443
00:45:03,123 --> 00:45:05,667
- One of us is gonna go to the shed.
- No way!

444
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:08,544
Shut up and listen!
There's friction tape there.

445
00:45:08,545 --> 00:45:11,464
You go get it, come back.
We'll tape the lid down.

446
00:45:11,465 --> 00:45:14,223
Then we're gonna get
the hell out of here!

447
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:17,428
- You get the tape, Jonesy.
- Don't be brave, Beav.

448
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:19,972
You're faster than me.
I'll sit on Thumper.

449
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:23,601
No, if it does get out, you can't
fight it. Not with your hip.

450
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:27,073
Oh, my God! Goddamn it! Go!

451
00:45:37,783 --> 00:45:39,826
- And Beav?
- Yeah?

452
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:42,419
Sit tight, buddy.

453
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:48,643
Okay. Okay.

454
00:46:40,763 --> 00:46:43,854
All right. Okay.

455
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:56,207
Shit! Earth to Jonesy!
Come in, Jonesy!

456
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:11,847
Jonesy. Jonesy.

457
00:47:12,336 --> 00:47:17,514
Okay. Calm down now. Okay.

458
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:20,301
Okay.

459
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:24,514
Okay, here it is. Okay.

460
00:47:29,228 --> 00:47:32,034
Find the damn tape!

461
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:46,895
Where is it?

462
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:52,110
Coming, Beav!

463
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:10,745
Beaver! Beav!

464
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:13,802
I got the... What the...?

465
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:22,058
Jonesy, get out of here!

466
00:49:22,424 --> 00:49:23,758
Beaver.

467
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:27,276
- Get out! Shut the door!
- No.

468
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:30,317
Run, Jonesy.

469
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:31,117
You killed him.

470
00:50:31,118 --> 00:50:33,786
You killed Beaver.

471
00:50:33,787 --> 00:50:36,878
You killed him, you fuck!

472
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:40,340
Ah!

473
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:10,185
What do you want?

474
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,638
They call the red stuff Ripley,
after the broad in the Alien movies.

475
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,349
We eradicate the animals
as they flee the Blue Zone.

476
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,600
The populace?

477
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:46,979
We bring civilians to Gosselin's. We'll
detain them till we figure this out.

478
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:52,610
And, Owen? This time the ETs
belong to you. That's right, bucko.

479
00:53:52,611 --> 00:53:54,862
- You'll be Blue Boy leader.
- Finally.

480
00:53:54,863 --> 00:53:57,573
- How many left?
- About a hundred.

481
00:53:57,574 --> 00:54:01,119
Yeah. Not nearly enough
for a serious incursion.

482
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,538
My guess is, it's a crash-landing.

483
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:07,333
They've never picked terrain like
this before or cold weather.

484
00:54:07,334 --> 00:54:08,835
What's your call?

485
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:12,088
The biggest threat is them
getting out of our net.

486
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:14,090
Crash-landing or not...

487
00:54:14,091 --> 00:54:17,396
they'll try to get out and
spread the infection.

488
00:54:18,178 --> 00:54:23,239
I always say they never visited a
world they wouldn't rather own.

489
00:54:23,392 --> 00:54:26,060
They're up to their old tricks.

490
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:28,896
Using a standard grayboy look...

491
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:33,276
with the innocent doggy eyes
and smooth baby-butt skin.

492
00:54:33,277 --> 00:54:36,320
They project what they
think we want to see.

493
00:54:36,321 --> 00:54:41,534
But I've had a look at the real thing. You
wouldn't want it marrying your sister.

494
00:54:41,535 --> 00:54:47,290
- Difference of opinion about the Ripley.
- Really? Who has an opinion?

495
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:49,709
- Who do you think?
- General Matheson.

496
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:53,713
- Three-star General Matheson.
- Three?

497
00:54:53,714 --> 00:54:56,507
- When did you see him?
- They called me in yesterday.

498
00:54:56,508 --> 00:55:00,511
What's the opinion of those
enlightened cocksuckers...

499
00:55:00,512 --> 00:55:02,555
who've never been near an ET?

500
00:55:02,556 --> 00:55:07,185
They say the fungus doesn't take hold
in all victims. Some of them get over it.

501
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:09,937
Really? And what about
the shit weasels?

502
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:12,440
The ones blasting out
the basement door?

503
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:15,610
Does Matheson think folks get
over one of those puppies?

504
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:22,083
Their theory is, they only grow in a small
percentage of the exposed population.

505
00:55:22,409 --> 00:55:25,583
Do you like that theory, bucko?

506
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:30,676
I think it's crap.

507
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:33,961
So if you thought someone
had been exposed...

508
00:55:33,962 --> 00:55:37,924
- ...and you had them in your grasp...
- I wouldn't want them walking out...

509
00:55:37,925 --> 00:55:44,472
- ...to wander as they wish.
- Bucko, I think we're on the same page.

510
00:55:44,473 --> 00:55:47,517
Pissing in the same latrine.

511
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:52,230
If the Ripley gets out of
this pine-tree paradise....

512
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:56,200
Well, it just can't be
allowed to do that.

513
00:55:56,735 --> 00:56:00,154
I've quarantined the entire area.

514
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:03,032
- Nothing leaves alive.
- Roger that, boss.

515
00:56:04,243 --> 00:56:05,874
Come!

516
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:09,718
Got Maples here, boss.

517
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:13,793
- Corporal Maples, sir. I mean, boss.
- I know who you are, Maples.

518
00:56:13,794 --> 00:56:18,840
I handpicked every man in Blue Boy.
Sometimes I wonder about my judgment.

519
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:22,719
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, boss.
- Do you know the catechism?

520
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,347
- Yes, the B.U.C. for all buckos.
- Is Blue Unit part of regular Army?

521
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:28,933
- No, boss. Better.
- How does Blue Unit operate?

522
00:56:28,934 --> 00:56:33,646
Under the radar. We don't salute, display
rank, say "sir." A force unto ourselves.

523
00:56:33,647 --> 00:56:35,982
- Regular Army compared to Blue Unit?
- Pussies.

524
00:56:35,983 --> 00:56:39,193
- What rules does it operate by?
- Rules of combat.

525
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:41,070
That's right, laddie.

526
00:56:41,071 --> 00:56:45,074
When a soldier disobeys a superior's
orders, he puts everyone at risk.

527
00:56:45,075 --> 00:56:48,828
And is to be punished immediately
by appropriate command personnel.

528
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:51,581
That's me. Capisce? Good.

529
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:54,876
Now answer me one question and
you can boogie out of here.

530
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:58,098
But you have to answer honestly.

531
00:56:59,256 --> 00:57:05,053
You were on containment detail at 0600
this morning, sector 14 of Blue Zone.

532
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,348
Did you allow a young woman
and her 4-year-old daughter...

533
00:57:08,349 --> 00:57:12,810
to exit the zone in their own
vehicle on Hickam Valley Road?

534
00:57:12,811 --> 00:57:15,855
Colonel Curtis, she
hadn't been in the zone.

535
00:57:15,856 --> 00:57:19,067
She made a wrong turn a few miles back.
She couldn't have been contaminated.

536
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,570
You know this for a fact?
Or because she told you so?

537
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:25,709
- For a fact, boss.
- Scout's honor?

538
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:34,048
Can you raise your hand and tell me
honestly that you know this for a fact?

539
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,460
Then do it, Maples.

540
00:57:40,461 --> 00:57:44,062
Swear on it. Scout's honor.

541
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:51,689
Scout's honor.

542
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:57,154
Stop your blatting, laddie-buck!

543
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,813
You just avoided a
court-martial, boy.

544
00:57:59,814 --> 00:58:02,816
You lie to me again, you'll
be facing a firing squad.

545
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:06,778
- Get him out before I change my mind.
- Let's get him out of here.

546
00:58:06,779 --> 00:58:08,921
Sentry!

547
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,793
- Jesus, Abe.
- I warned him.

548
00:58:21,794 --> 00:58:25,088
Could have gotten off
with a slap on the wrist.

549
00:58:25,089 --> 00:58:28,883
- Instead of taking his whole hand?
- He crossed the Curtis line!

550
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:31,970
He came into my house, told me lies.

551
00:58:31,971 --> 00:58:34,943
- You think I'm crazy, Owen?
- A little.

552
00:58:38,686 --> 00:58:42,897
I lost my temper there. But that
little worm did something worse.

553
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:45,483
The pretty mom he let
pass this morning?

554
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:49,028
She's down at the barn right
now crawling with the Ripley.

555
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,864
Twenty-five years, Owen.

556
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:55,160
Twenty-five years I've been going
out to fight these alien bastards...

557
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:59,873
show them they picked the wrong
place, knocked on the wrong door.

558
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:03,209
And frankly, laddie, the tank
is running a little low.

559
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:08,047
Luckily for me, there's one bit of good
news in this blizzard of bullshit.

560
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:13,773
I have you. To lead the assault today
and to take over for me tomorrow.

561
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:17,682
- What are you talking about, Abe?
- It's my last dance, Owen.

562
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:22,660
From now on, you will lead the band.

563
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:25,899
- You know where I got that?
- John Wayne.

564
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:30,236
That's right. He gave it to me.
And now I'm giving it to you.

565
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:35,658
- Abe, I don't know how to....
- Let's not get all girlie with each other.

566
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:39,078
- Just tell me how we do it.
- We go in fast and hard.

567
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,789
- How do we come out?
- Clean...

568
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:43,382
and smiling.

569
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:55,687
Ah.

570
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,568
Honey, I'm home.

571
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:16,115
That's a good idea.
Catch a little shuteye.

572
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:20,335
Save your energy for
those horrendous farts!

573
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:35,742
Well, it's very nice of you to say so.
I find you very attractive also.

574
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:41,117
You're one of those rare women who can
handle the full-size Ford Expedition.

575
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:46,998
The truck that handles like a luxury car.
A really big luxury car.

576
01:01:52,338 --> 01:01:56,841
But seriously, folks, there is one
issue I'd like to bring up...

577
01:01:56,842 --> 01:02:00,929
just in case I should, you know,
kick the bucket out here...

578
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:07,185
turn into a goddamn Petesicle.
Not that I think that's inevitable.

579
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:12,199
I'm sure Henry or Jonesy or Beaver
will be coming to get us soon.

580
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:16,251
They're my friends.
We're all best friends.

581
01:02:17,822 --> 01:02:21,741
Now, ma'am, I'll be very
candid with you about this...

582
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:26,704
so please, don't get freaked out or
think that I'm some kind of weirdo...

583
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:29,916
who you shouldn't meet for the
best fried clams in Maine.

584
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:34,100
Just some innocent fried
clams at the West Wharf!

585
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:37,590
You see, the four of
us, best friends...

586
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:41,052
we all have this other friend
by the name of Duddits.

587
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:46,196
And our friend Duddits, well,
he's not your average old buddy.

588
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:52,647
One day, a long time ago,
he gave us all this kind of gift.

589
01:02:52,648 --> 01:02:56,747
It's this.... How shall I put it?

590
01:02:56,777 --> 01:03:02,407
This ability. This ability
to know things...

591
01:03:02,408 --> 01:03:06,828
to talk to each other without
talking at all, just mind-to-mind.

592
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:10,098
Do you see what I'm getting at?

593
01:03:16,422 --> 01:03:18,896
I knew you would.

594
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:22,552
Lately, I've been
having this dream...

595
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:29,108
and in the dream, I understand how
Duddits could give us a gift like that.

596
01:03:29,727 --> 01:03:32,812
I think maybe our friend Duds
is not from this planet.

597
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:35,398
I think Duddits is
from somewhere else...

598
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:41,456
and he came here to
prepare us for something.

599
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:47,425
It's crazy.

600
01:03:47,912 --> 01:03:52,046
Talking shit about the only
perfect person I ever knew.

601
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:58,099
He's so goddamned good.
I can't believe he's a human.

602
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:03,343
I should be singing his praises,
not questioning what galaxy he's...

603
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:05,486
I gotta pee.

604
01:04:08,808 --> 01:04:10,570
That's what I should do.

605
01:04:21,737 --> 01:04:23,962
Here's to you, Duds.

606
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,797
The highest civilian decoration.

607
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:41,138
Lord, I will never drink again.

608
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,777
Let me get this straight.

609
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:49,991
Yesterday you want to call it quits,
throw in the towel, pull the plug.

610
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:55,789
Today, you're begging, praying.
Couple more hours. Couple more miles.

611
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,458
Make up your mind.

612
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:02,670
Jonesy! Way to go, motherfucker!

613
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:05,063
Here you come to save the day!

614
01:06:08,928 --> 01:06:10,903
What the hell?

615
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:14,612
Who's Mr. Gray?

616
01:06:15,226 --> 01:06:18,233
What are you trying
to tell me, Jonesy?

617
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:22,281
You're not Jonesy.

618
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:02,939
What was that, Mr. Jones?
What did we just pass?

619
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:07,777
- Are you speaking to me?
- Yes, I am, Mr. Jones. Or is it Jonesy?

620
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:12,198
That's what your friends call
you, isn't it? Let's be friends.

621
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:15,368
- Why are you letting me live?
- I'm borrowing you.

622
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:20,707
- We're going to take a little journey.
- Beaver never hurt a soul. You killed him.

623
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:24,878
He had nothing in his head.
I've found something useful in yours.

624
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:28,089
- Fuck you!
- I know what that expression means.

625
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:31,593
I've studied the foul language
section of your memory warehouse.

626
01:07:31,594 --> 01:07:33,761
Rather distasteful, I must say.

627
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:37,482
How about this, Mr. Gray?
Eat shit and die.

628
01:07:40,144 --> 01:07:42,562
Why did you call me Mr. Gray?

629
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:46,065
Watch out for Ister Gay.

630
01:07:46,066 --> 01:07:50,111
Someone told you about me.
Who told you about me?

631
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:52,864
If you want to know, why
don't you read my mind?

632
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:55,742
Surprisingly, you're able
to keep things from me...

633
01:07:55,743 --> 01:07:59,546
I don't understand it. But I'm
sure I'll figure it out soon.

634
01:08:19,934 --> 01:08:21,768
Oh, Pete, Jesus!

635
01:08:21,769 --> 01:08:24,604
Motherfucker tried to
bite my dick off, Jonesy.

636
01:08:24,605 --> 01:08:27,696
I always thought it would
be my ex-wife did that.

637
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:31,117
Let's get you to some help.

638
01:08:32,947 --> 01:08:35,872
Can you still see the line, buddy?

639
01:08:36,075 --> 01:08:40,954
- I don't need it to get to Gosselin's.
- No, I know that, but...

640
01:08:40,955 --> 01:08:45,375
if we didn't want to go to Gosselin's,
how would you get us out to 95?

641
01:08:45,376 --> 01:08:50,270
95? Who gives a shit?
I'm hurting here, Jonesy.

642
01:08:52,508 --> 01:08:54,732
What's wrong with you?

643
01:08:56,971 --> 01:08:59,597
- Wait a minute, you're not...
- Shut up, Pete.

644
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:02,142
You're too messed up to
know what you're saying.

645
01:09:02,143 --> 01:09:06,813
Too late for that. Pete, I need you
to get onto the snowmobile right now.

646
01:09:06,814 --> 01:09:10,483
Who the fuck are you? You sound
like one of those James Bonds!

647
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:14,584
This has to do with the fucking
eel, doesn't it? You're not...

648
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:24,216
Stop it! I'll get him to help. Pete,
tell him what he wants to know.

649
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:39,274
Now, Pete, which way to I-95?
I need to go to Massachusetts.

650
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:03,712
My, my. That is a gift.

651
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:06,298
Who taught you that?

652
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,976
You're gonna be a big help, Pete.

653
01:10:15,925 --> 01:10:18,268
Climb aboard.

654
01:10:34,068 --> 01:10:37,278
- Show's over. Let me in.
- Let me in.

655
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:41,032
What have you got in that
part of your mind, professor?

656
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:44,744
Your memories are out here in
the warehouse, aren't they?

657
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:48,915
I want to know who warned you about
me. And who taught Pete that trick?

658
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:52,585
I'm sure the answers are here.
It'll just take me a while to find them.

659
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:54,754
- To find them.
- Think about letting me in.

660
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:58,356
- It's the polite thing to do.
- Polite thing to do.

661
01:12:01,363 --> 01:12:03,790
Beav!

662
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:40,291
What is this?

663
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:11,981
Oh, Beav.

664
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,861
Shit!

665
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:21,289
Fuck me, Freddy.

666
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:16,628
Oh, shit.

667
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,777
Asshole!

668
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:57,213
So long, Beav. Love you, man.

669
01:17:12,758 --> 01:17:14,384
We all made them in art.

670
01:17:14,385 --> 01:17:16,761
I finished first.
I made one for Duds.

671
01:17:16,762 --> 01:17:20,233
Mine's deformed. I couldn't
figure out the string.

672
01:17:20,724 --> 01:17:26,745
- Eaver, Henny, Ownzy, Eet!
- That's right, my man.

673
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:29,075
I Duddits.

674
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:32,704
- Yes. I Duddits.
- I Duddits!

675
01:17:33,112 --> 01:17:36,084
I Duddits!

676
01:17:38,075 --> 01:17:40,326
- Duds will find her.
- How?

677
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:43,204
- He can do anything.
- She's from the Academy.

678
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:46,925
- She always waves.
- We've gotta save this girl.

679
01:17:49,003 --> 01:17:52,505
- Save this world?
- Not the world, Duds. A girl.

680
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:55,508
- We'll save the world some other time.
- Ister Gay?

681
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:58,052
- Yeah, it's a mystery.
- We need you to solve it.

682
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:00,722
- Dreamcatcher. Duds'll read our minds.
- Not this.

683
01:18:00,723 --> 01:18:02,765
Shut up. We gotta think of Josie.

684
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:05,608
Josie, Josie, Josie.

685
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:09,658
"Josie Rinkenhauer."

686
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:08,712
- Josie?
- That's right. Can you find Josie?

687
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:52,625
- This is completely crazy.
- You can say that again.

688
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:55,211
- I didn't say anything.
- You did. I heard you.

689
01:19:55,212 --> 01:20:00,059
- You said, "This is completely crazy."
- I didn't say that.

690
01:20:00,426 --> 01:20:03,018
I thought it.

691
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:08,933
Kiss my bender. Duds can hear
people's thoughts. We can't.

692
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:11,076
Are you sure of that, Beav?

693
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:59,582
Hey, guys! She's down here for sure!

694
01:21:11,372 --> 01:21:13,466
Josie, you down there?

695
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:18,135
Josie! Josie!

696
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:22,507
Fuck me, Freddy, she's down there.

697
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:26,469
I know it. I can see her in my head.

698
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:29,722
- Yeah.
- Me too.

699
01:21:29,723 --> 01:21:33,059
Help! Please!

700
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:36,729
- Help me.
- Hold on, Josie, we're coming!

701
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:39,357
Josie, hang in there!

702
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:46,990
Don't sing. She's scared enough.

703
01:21:46,991 --> 01:21:52,245
- Shut up. There's, like, rat shit.
- Hold on to my feet!

704
01:21:52,246 --> 01:21:54,720
Pete, do you see anything?

705
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:00,848
- Duds! We got her!
- Here's Josie.

706
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:36,931
Blue Boy leader.
How we doing, bucko?

707
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:43,390
- Right here, boss. Fast and hard.
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

708
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:46,725
Sir?

709
01:22:48,469 --> 01:22:50,896
I see it.

710
01:23:02,942 --> 01:23:04,984
- Don't hurt us.
- We're dying.

711
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:07,695
- There is no infection here.
- Whose radio is that?

712
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:10,824
It's not the radio. They're
putting it into our heads.

713
01:23:10,825 --> 01:23:13,159
- We are helpless.
- There it is, gentlemen.

714
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,830
- There's no infection here.
- Directly into our heads.

715
01:23:16,831 --> 01:23:19,886
This gives you an idea
what we're up against.

716
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:24,504
If anybody's thinking,
"Those poor, helpless little folk...

717
01:23:24,505 --> 01:23:28,800
all naked and unarmed beside their
crashed intergalactic Winnebago...

718
01:23:28,801 --> 01:23:31,970
what kind of a dog,
what kind of a monster...

719
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:34,889
could hear that heartbreak
and go in just the same?"

720
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:40,186
- Well, I'm that dog. I'm that monster.
- We are helpless. We are dying.

721
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:43,189
These mothers are as harmless
as a fox in a henhouse.

722
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:46,192
And I'm here to kick some ass!
Are you with me?

723
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:48,236
- Yes, boss!
- Roger that, boss.

724
01:23:48,237 --> 01:23:50,000
Right on, boss.

725
01:23:50,489 --> 01:23:53,165
Don't hurt us.

726
01:23:56,996 --> 01:23:59,387
I have a visual.

727
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:03,751
Holy shit!

728
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:06,310
Damn, look at the size of that.

729
01:24:07,173 --> 01:24:11,926
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Target imminent. Go to level 4 readiness.

730
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:14,686
Gentlemen, lock and load.

731
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:17,985
Hellfires are hot.

732
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:20,852
Sing it out, Owen!

733
01:24:20,853 --> 01:24:26,566
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Clean up the forest, get rid of this trash!

734
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:29,360
- Don't hurt us.
- Please, don't hurt us.

735
01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:32,739
- There is no infection here.
- We are helpless.

736
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:35,795
- Fire at will!
- Fire!

737
01:25:48,482 --> 01:25:51,075
Owen, get them out of there!

738
01:25:51,652 --> 01:25:53,486
It's gonna blow!

739
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:57,323
Blue Boy group, withdraw at once.
I repeat, cease firing and back off!

740
01:25:57,324 --> 01:26:00,076
- We can get them!
- It's self-destructing.

741
01:26:00,077 --> 01:26:03,512
- Blue Boy group, get out of there!
- We're on top of it!

742
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:05,874
Owen, pull out now!

743
01:26:05,875 --> 01:26:09,808
- Pull out! Get out of there!
- Pull out!

744
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:41,630
Jonesy, I've been thinking about
our friend. Our Scooby-Doo buddy.

745
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:45,663
For a long time I thought he was sent
to us to warn us about something.

746
01:26:45,664 --> 01:26:48,792
- I could never figure what it was.
- Don't talk about him.

747
01:26:48,793 --> 01:26:53,639
Not till today.
It was this, right now.

748
01:26:53,756 --> 01:26:59,219
- He wanted to warn us.
- Tell me about your friend.

749
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:04,641
- Did he show you that nifty trick?
- No. Jonesy's right.

750
01:27:04,642 --> 01:27:09,322
- Come on, Pete. Let's talk.
- Bite my bag, motherfucker!

751
01:27:12,608 --> 01:27:18,499
All right, Pete, I'll bite.
Your bag and everything else.

752
01:27:21,826 --> 01:27:25,592
No, no! You bastard! No!

753
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:36,478
Pete.

754
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:27,772
Don't talk to him! Get out of there!

755
01:28:29,143 --> 01:28:30,351
Ah.

756
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:34,481
- What's up?
- Thank God you came by, governor.

757
01:28:34,482 --> 01:28:37,655
I'm broke down here
and fearing for my life.

758
01:28:37,735 --> 01:28:39,527
That's a good-looking dog.

759
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:41,779
- Where you headed?
- Gosselin's.

760
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:44,824
Any chance you're going near there?

761
01:28:44,825 --> 01:28:47,169
That's where I'm going.

762
01:28:47,495 --> 01:28:51,760
Well, I believe your
tailgate has come open.

763
01:28:57,671 --> 01:28:59,979
Let's take a look.

764
01:29:07,056 --> 01:29:10,776
I see you have some cargo
you're taking to Blue Base.

765
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:37,013
Got a treat for you, Ike.

766
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:44,606
All you can eat.
Eat all the red stuff.

767
01:29:45,678 --> 01:29:51,983
Good doggy. Yes. Good boy.

768
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:56,437
Have your fill. Tasty, tasty.

769
01:29:56,438 --> 01:29:57,939
Eat all you want...

770
01:30:01,485 --> 01:30:06,712
Jonesy. What are you up to?

771
01:30:41,442 --> 01:30:43,417
Jonesy!

772
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:06,183
Oh, God!

773
01:31:57,935 --> 01:32:02,188
Halt or we'll fire! You cannot
leave the quarantine zone!

774
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:04,948
- Halt!
- I think I just about halted here.

775
01:32:09,989 --> 01:32:11,698
Come with me, Owen.

776
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:15,300
I'll show you things you'll
wish you'd never seen.

777
01:32:29,925 --> 01:32:33,277
- How long we gotta be here?
- It'll be all right.

778
01:32:37,224 --> 01:32:41,442
- I demand to see my lawyer!
- There must be something they can do.

779
01:32:43,147 --> 01:32:44,898
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

780
01:32:44,899 --> 01:32:47,400
- When do we get out?
- Within hours.

781
01:32:47,401 --> 01:32:51,779
- You can't do this to people in America!
- I told you to stay over there!

782
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,407
- My wife...
- Government's doing what...

783
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:57,619
they can to get you out of here.
Don't worry. It's all right.

784
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:00,371
We're doing everything to
make sure you're safe.

785
01:33:00,372 --> 01:33:03,843
We'll get you back to
your homes within hours.

786
01:33:12,843 --> 01:33:15,103
All clear.

787
01:33:37,034 --> 01:33:39,953
Can I help you, sir?
What's your name?

788
01:33:39,954 --> 01:33:44,165
- Henry. Dr. Henry Devlin.
- A doctor? Good.

789
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:46,426
We need doctors in there.

790
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:50,849
Come on, laddie, I'll buy you a cup.

791
01:33:52,258 --> 01:33:57,484
- You, sir, where you from?
- Boston.

792
01:33:57,555 --> 01:34:03,309
Beantown? Great city. We'll
have you back there in no time.

793
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:05,737
Maybe by morning.

794
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:08,739
Hurry up, bucko.

795
01:34:18,617 --> 01:34:21,494
You see that crud on the
faces of children...

796
01:34:21,495 --> 01:34:26,259
you know why I relish a turn in
the country like we had today.

797
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:31,768
You were excellent out there, O.
It made me feel very proud to...

798
01:34:34,091 --> 01:34:38,523
Abe? Abe, you okay?

799
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:41,939
Abe?

800
01:34:43,934 --> 01:34:46,361
Yeah.

801
01:34:48,189 --> 01:34:54,127
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I must
be getting too old for this shit.

802
01:34:54,695 --> 01:34:58,082
I don't know what the
hell that was about.

803
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:14,345
It's the only way, Owen.

804
01:35:14,548 --> 01:35:17,818
We've got to cauterize the site.

805
01:35:18,844 --> 01:35:21,437
They've all got to die.

806
01:35:22,223 --> 01:35:24,057
It's the only way.

807
01:35:24,058 --> 01:35:26,059
But we don't know that.

808
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:30,688
Studies point to the strong possibility
of recovery for many exposed subjects.

809
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,566
The studies show squat,
that's what they show.

810
01:35:33,567 --> 01:35:36,986
If Matheson had been in my spot
for the last quarter-century...

811
01:35:36,987 --> 01:35:40,031
you'd have never made
it to your first jerk-off.

812
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:44,577
Those gray bastards would have had
you for lunch back in Armpit, Kentucky.

813
01:35:44,578 --> 01:35:48,081
Some get better. At least half
will be over it in a few days...

814
01:35:48,082 --> 01:35:50,416
Which ones, Mother Teresa?

815
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:54,921
Can you guarantee they won't take
it home like a present for the family?

816
01:35:54,922 --> 01:35:58,967
I'll tell you what you should be worried
about. What should be on your mind.

817
01:35:58,968 --> 01:36:01,094
Not these few unfortunates.

818
01:36:01,095 --> 01:36:03,805
What you should be worried
about is a hitchhiker.

819
01:36:03,806 --> 01:36:05,431
- What?
- A hitchhiker.

820
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:08,726
Our greatest fear is that a
grayboy would catch a ride...

821
01:36:08,727 --> 01:36:12,981
with somebody and would carry them
out of here, without being consumed.

822
01:36:12,982 --> 01:36:16,192
To scatter the infection,
like Johnny-fucking-Appleseed.

823
01:36:16,193 --> 01:36:18,611
- Are you sure there isn't such a person?
- No.

824
01:36:18,612 --> 01:36:21,364
But I am sure that if there
is one he won't get out.

825
01:36:21,365 --> 01:36:24,325
Not with the net my boys put
up around the Blue Zone.

826
01:36:24,326 --> 01:36:27,120
And if we do a thorough job
on the ones we've got.

827
01:36:27,121 --> 01:36:29,539
If we don't get gooey
about the little picture...

828
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:32,298
when our job is taking
care of the big one.

829
01:36:32,376 --> 01:36:34,127
Capisce?

830
01:36:34,128 --> 01:36:38,678
Owen, if you think this is easy for me,
you're crazier than my mother was.

831
01:36:39,633 --> 01:36:41,858
Those poor schmucks.

832
01:36:42,052 --> 01:36:45,972
They drive Chevrolets,
shop at Wal-Mart...

833
01:36:45,973 --> 01:36:48,566
never miss an episode of Friends.

834
01:36:49,059 --> 01:36:51,533
These are Americans.

835
01:36:52,646 --> 01:36:55,453
The idea of slaughtering
Americans...

836
01:36:57,651 --> 01:37:00,493
it just turns my stomach.

837
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:08,761
But I'll do it. I'll do it
because it needs to be done.

838
01:37:09,663 --> 01:37:14,724
So if we start at 2, we can be done
by 2:30. And it's all behind us.

839
01:37:15,044 --> 01:37:17,636
Except for the dreams.

840
01:37:20,007 --> 01:37:23,015
Yeah, except for them.

841
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:38,358
What are you gonna tell Rita
about what you did here?

842
01:37:38,359 --> 01:37:42,541
What are you gonna tell Katrina
when she's old enough to ask?

843
01:37:45,616 --> 01:37:48,701
You know me, don't you?
I don't remember when we met...

844
01:37:48,702 --> 01:37:50,453
but you know me.

845
01:37:50,454 --> 01:37:54,541
We don't have time to screw around.
You've got two problems.

846
01:37:54,542 --> 01:37:58,419
- One you know about, one you don't.
- Go ahead.

847
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:04,425
Your mentor, Colonel Curtis, he's gone
insane from hunting aliens for 25 years.

848
01:38:04,426 --> 01:38:09,024
Now he wants you to help him
kill hundreds of innocent people.

849
01:38:09,515 --> 01:38:11,683
- Who are you?
- Me?

850
01:38:11,684 --> 01:38:14,769
Talk about that later,
once we get out of here.

851
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:16,980
- Hey.
- You're predictable.

852
01:38:16,981 --> 01:38:18,857
You won't let me burn
on this fence...

853
01:38:18,858 --> 01:38:21,693
any more than you'll help
Curtis kill those people.

854
01:38:21,694 --> 01:38:25,613
What you're thinking now is whether
that digital sat-scan transmitter...

855
01:38:25,614 --> 01:38:29,299
in your duffle bag will let
you get through to somebody.

856
01:38:29,743 --> 01:38:35,219
- Somebody named General Matheson.
- Hmm.

857
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,021
"Sometimes we have to kill, but
our real job is to save lives."

858
01:38:45,593 --> 01:38:48,344
Your father was a great soldier.

859
01:38:48,345 --> 01:38:49,971
Those were his last words.

860
01:38:49,972 --> 01:38:52,730
You carry his picture
with you always.

861
01:38:55,269 --> 01:38:57,529
Tell me everything.

862
01:38:58,105 --> 01:39:00,190
You'll save these people.

863
01:39:00,191 --> 01:39:03,818
When we're done talking, get on
the transmitter, contact Matheson.

864
01:39:03,819 --> 01:39:05,278
Cavalry rides in.

865
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:08,740
That takes care of problem number
one. Now comes the hard part.

866
01:39:08,741 --> 01:39:13,453
You think the infection's been
contained, that there's no hitchhiker.

867
01:39:13,454 --> 01:39:17,332
You're wrong. He's riding
with my best friend on earth.

868
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:20,794
A guy named Gary Jones.
And he's out there.

869
01:39:20,795 --> 01:39:25,340
You and I don't get after him right
away, he'll get out of my range...

870
01:39:25,341 --> 01:39:28,895
and some kind of shit is
gonna hit the planetary fan.

871
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:45,401
Our nightmare hitchhiker.

872
01:39:45,402 --> 01:39:51,115
And all Dr. Mystery wants is a free
pass so he can catch his friend.

873
01:39:51,116 --> 01:39:54,786
- Very convenient.
- I'm saying you ought to hear his story.

874
01:39:54,787 --> 01:39:56,371
Okay. Where is he?

875
01:39:56,372 --> 01:39:58,665
Had him taken to the tractor shed.

876
01:39:58,666 --> 01:40:02,210
Okay. I'll check him out
and we can compare notes.

877
01:40:02,211 --> 01:40:04,519
Whatever you say, boss.

878
01:40:10,803 --> 01:40:14,772
Come on, come on. Time's a-wasting.

879
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:26,872
All right, lad, open up.

880
01:40:44,712 --> 01:40:46,592
Dr. Boston?

881
01:40:47,381 --> 01:40:49,310
Are you in here?

882
01:40:50,134 --> 01:40:51,718
I'm here.

883
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:53,647
Where I've been put.

884
01:40:54,221 --> 01:40:56,681
A prisoner on my own damn property.

885
01:41:01,228 --> 01:41:03,157
Let's go!

886
01:41:04,231 --> 01:41:06,242
Come on, let's go.

887
01:41:12,281 --> 01:41:14,459
Get in!

888
01:41:15,951 --> 01:41:17,869
You almost ran me down.

889
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:21,340
Figured you'd read my mind
and get out of the way.

890
01:41:23,876 --> 01:41:28,880
Blue Unit, stand down. You are
under regular Army command.

891
01:41:28,881 --> 01:41:31,474
- Put down your weapons at once.
- Get down!

892
01:41:31,926 --> 01:41:34,636
Your mission is rescinded.

893
01:41:34,637 --> 01:41:38,139
This is no longer a
Blue Unit operation.

894
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:43,436
Put down your arms.
Repeat, put down your arms.

895
01:41:43,437 --> 01:41:47,287
General Matheson has
assumed command.

896
01:41:56,075 --> 01:41:57,920
Okay, Owen.

897
01:41:57,993 --> 01:41:59,874
Okay.

898
01:41:59,995 --> 01:42:03,715
You just drove over the Curtis line.

899
01:42:05,292 --> 01:42:07,335
- Where we going?
- South.

900
01:42:07,336 --> 01:42:10,296
All I know right now. Just
get me in range of Jonesy...

901
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:12,771
we'll know everything
we need to know.

902
01:42:35,906 --> 01:42:39,293
That's some gun. Can I have a look?

903
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,502
- Kind of flashy for a guy like you.
- It's a gift.

904
01:42:49,503 --> 01:42:51,763
I know.

905
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:55,008
Where are you, Jonesy?

906
01:42:55,009 --> 01:42:58,645
Pick up the phone. Call 1-800-HENRY.

907
01:43:14,570 --> 01:43:16,696
Hello? Jonesy!

908
01:43:16,697 --> 01:43:20,962
Jesus Christ, I knew it was you.
Where's he taking you?

909
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:23,661
Massachusetts? He is?

910
01:43:23,662 --> 01:43:27,373
Duddits? Okay, I will.
You hang in there, Jonesy.

911
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:29,255
Jonesy?

912
01:43:29,335 --> 01:43:31,310
He hung up.

913
01:43:31,837 --> 01:43:34,097
Give me back my gun.

914
01:43:35,758 --> 01:43:38,384
- We gotta go to Derry.
- That where they're going?

915
01:43:38,385 --> 01:43:41,679
No, they're going towards
Massachusetts. We need Duddits.

916
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,891
Jonesy says Mr. Gray
is afraid of Duddits.

917
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:49,103
Your buddy, he's still alive after
all this time with Mr. Gray?

918
01:43:49,104 --> 01:43:52,540
Yeah, he's immune.
I think it's because he died.

919
01:43:53,692 --> 01:43:58,029
He got hit by a car and
his heart stopped. Twice.

920
01:43:58,030 --> 01:44:00,198
I don't think he even knows it.

921
01:44:00,199 --> 01:44:04,334
He came back from the dead.
Must have changed him somehow.

922
01:44:05,454 --> 01:44:10,597
It's almost like Duddits saw this
whole thing coming. Is that it?

923
01:44:12,378 --> 01:44:16,464
Jonesy told me it was Duddits
who drew him into the accident.

924
01:44:16,465 --> 01:44:19,467
If we catch him, we're
gonna have to kill him.

925
01:44:19,468 --> 01:44:23,596
You know we have to do it. It's
the only way to stop Mr. Gray...

926
01:44:23,597 --> 01:44:26,237
assuming we can catch him.

927
01:44:28,769 --> 01:44:31,312
When was the last
time you saw Duddits?

928
01:44:31,313 --> 01:44:33,538
Long time ago.

929
01:44:34,066 --> 01:44:36,041
Years.

930
01:44:36,902 --> 01:44:39,737
What makes you so sure he can help?

931
01:44:39,738 --> 01:44:41,963
Duddits can do anything.

932
01:44:42,324 --> 01:44:47,218
I didn't understand that then,
but I think it's always been true.

933
01:44:47,329 --> 01:44:49,998
He's the one who made us like this.

934
01:44:49,999 --> 01:44:53,386
- Like what?
- You know, weird.

935
01:45:09,059 --> 01:45:10,810
He's been waiting for you.

936
01:45:10,811 --> 01:45:12,353
Blizzard slowed us up.

937
01:45:12,354 --> 01:45:15,113
Henny, Henny.

938
01:45:15,649 --> 01:45:17,744
Henny.

939
01:45:21,906 --> 01:45:24,282
I miss you, Henny.

940
01:45:24,283 --> 01:45:26,840
I miss you.

941
01:45:28,829 --> 01:45:30,663
Henny.

942
01:45:30,664 --> 01:45:35,558
Long time, Henny. Henny.

943
01:45:38,172 --> 01:45:42,935
- My God, Roberta, what is it?
- Lymphocytic leukemia.

944
01:45:45,387 --> 01:45:50,448
I'm gonna let you take him,
but I have to tell you why.

945
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:54,114
Just now, when he was
getting ready...

946
01:45:55,397 --> 01:45:58,983
Henry, he was so excited.

947
01:45:58,984 --> 01:46:02,455
Like he hasn't been
in such a long time.

948
01:46:08,911 --> 01:46:10,870
I think...

949
01:46:10,871 --> 01:46:14,874
that if he's with you,
he might die happy...

950
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:17,801
instead of in this awful room.

951
01:46:19,713 --> 01:46:23,813
Be sure the parka stays on
tight. Cold devastates him.

952
01:46:24,218 --> 01:46:27,985
The medication and
instructions are in here.

953
01:46:28,722 --> 01:46:30,431
Bye, Mom.

954
01:46:43,571 --> 01:46:47,337
Goodbye, Duddie. Be a good boy.

955
01:46:48,868 --> 01:46:51,793
Now, go save the world.

956
01:47:20,232 --> 01:47:22,066
All right, laddie.

957
01:47:22,067 --> 01:47:25,945
They haven't got enough courage to
take my trailer. Not yet, anyway.

958
01:47:25,946 --> 01:47:27,322
What've we got?

959
01:47:27,323 --> 01:47:32,619
They're leaving Derry, Maine, heading
south on 95. Toward Massachusetts.

960
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:34,162
Massachusetts?

961
01:47:36,165 --> 01:47:38,508
Stay with it, bucko.

962
01:47:50,471 --> 01:47:53,229
General Matheson. Come in, please.

963
01:47:56,268 --> 01:47:57,977
This is very nice, Abe.

964
01:47:57,978 --> 01:48:00,647
Been home through some rough times.

965
01:48:00,648 --> 01:48:03,483
Was there something
we hadn't covered?

966
01:48:03,484 --> 01:48:07,529
I don't think I got to say before how
much I respect the work you've done.

967
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:09,572
It was with sincere regret...

968
01:48:09,573 --> 01:48:12,380
Herman... May I call you Herman?

969
01:48:12,409 --> 01:48:16,913
We may not agree on all the strategic
initiatives, but we do agree on this:

970
01:48:16,914 --> 01:48:21,876
I'm past it. Burned out.
Just needed a push, that's all.

971
01:48:21,877 --> 01:48:24,629
Should have quit after
that mess in Montana.

972
01:48:27,049 --> 01:48:30,223
Even I don't trust
my judgment anymore.

973
01:48:31,178 --> 01:48:32,804
Oh, yeah....

974
01:48:32,805 --> 01:48:37,100
My techies tell me we're getting some
electronics reading hot from in here.

975
01:48:37,101 --> 01:48:40,520
Yes, I've been talking to
the wife on my sat phone.

976
01:48:40,521 --> 01:48:44,858
I don't know if you've ever met Barbara.
She's been after me for years to retire.

977
01:48:44,859 --> 01:48:49,571
She's very happy, I can tell you that. I'll
have everything shut down in an hour.

978
01:48:49,572 --> 01:48:52,991
If that's soon enough.

979
01:48:52,992 --> 01:48:55,300
That will be fine.

980
01:49:42,625 --> 01:49:44,918
How do you turn off
the goddamn lights?

981
01:49:44,919 --> 01:49:48,463
Maybe you shouldn't have been
so fast to kill that trooper.

982
01:49:48,464 --> 01:49:50,256
You're making yourself at home.

983
01:49:50,257 --> 01:49:54,093
You have no idea, Jonesy.
Tell me how you like this:

984
01:49:54,094 --> 01:49:59,356
"Maybe you shouldn't have been so
fast to kill that trooper." Not bad?

985
01:50:00,059 --> 01:50:02,367
Oh, don't like that, Gary, do you?

986
01:50:02,937 --> 01:50:07,155
Ownzy. He's in a police car now.

987
01:50:07,608 --> 01:50:09,442
He's in a police car now.

988
01:50:09,443 --> 01:50:11,870
Can you see where they are, Duds?

989
01:50:12,947 --> 01:50:16,713
Ownzy. He's in Ister Gay.

990
01:50:17,701 --> 01:50:19,744
Mr. Gray.

991
01:50:19,745 --> 01:50:22,122
That's right, Duds,
he is in Mr. Gray.

992
01:50:22,123 --> 01:50:24,541
"Ister Gay" is Mr. Gray.

993
01:50:24,542 --> 01:50:26,552
We gotta save this girl.

994
01:50:26,961 --> 01:50:28,586
Save the world?

995
01:50:28,587 --> 01:50:32,298
Not the world, Duds, a girl. We'll
save the world some other time.

996
01:50:32,299 --> 01:50:33,931
Ister Gay?

997
01:50:36,971 --> 01:50:39,398
You already knew.

998
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:43,527
Where's he going, Duds?

999
01:50:43,727 --> 01:50:49,286
Where is Mr. Gray
taking Jonesy? Duds?

1000
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:05,665
Ister Gay, he want war.

1001
01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:08,757
- War?
- Not war, water.

1002
01:51:09,253 --> 01:51:11,513
Mr. Gray wants water.

1003
01:51:11,589 --> 01:51:13,006
I know where he's going.

1004
01:51:13,007 --> 01:51:15,967
- He's going to the Quabbin Reservoir.
- What's Quabbin?

1005
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:18,845
It supplies drinking
water for all of Boston.

1006
01:51:18,846 --> 01:51:22,530
- Hmm.
- What?

1007
01:51:23,809 --> 01:51:27,079
One worm kills the world.

1008
01:51:27,146 --> 01:51:30,201
One worm kills the world?

1009
01:51:30,858 --> 01:51:34,194
Oh, my God. One worm.

1010
01:51:34,195 --> 01:51:37,822
Back at our cabin, I saw the worms
that come out of these weasels.

1011
01:51:37,823 --> 01:51:41,508
Mr. Gray must want to get one
into the Boston drinking supply.

1012
01:51:43,788 --> 01:51:47,424
Just one worm infects
the whole world?

1013
01:51:48,876 --> 01:51:50,543
- Are we going right?
- Yes.

1014
01:51:50,544 --> 01:51:55,381
Take the 495 to the Mass Pike.
It's not far. You're doing great, buddy.

1015
01:51:55,382 --> 01:51:59,552
Are you ready to try something hard?
I want to ask you something hard.

1016
01:51:59,553 --> 01:52:01,262
Yes, Henny.

1017
01:52:01,263 --> 01:52:06,359
Good. Can you talk to Jonesy?

1018
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:09,069
Can you make him hear you?

1019
01:52:09,230 --> 01:52:11,490
Ownzy...

1020
01:52:12,733 --> 01:52:15,871
and Ister Gay.

1021
01:52:16,612 --> 01:52:18,327
Duddits.

1022
01:52:28,082 --> 01:52:32,418
I knew it. I knew it.
He's been here all along.

1023
01:52:32,419 --> 01:52:34,348
Waiting.

1024
01:52:34,421 --> 01:52:39,315
Jonesy? It appears we
didn't meet by accident.

1025
01:52:40,094 --> 01:52:43,805
We owe it to our friend, Duddits.

1026
01:52:43,806 --> 01:52:47,767
- I don't know what you mean.
- No? Maybe not.

1027
01:52:47,768 --> 01:52:51,437
Maybe your clever friend didn't want
you to know what he was up to.

1028
01:52:51,438 --> 01:52:57,033
That's why you had nothing
in the warehouse about me.

1029
01:52:57,778 --> 01:53:01,877
Duddits didn't bother to tell you
what job he had in mind for you.

1030
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:04,451
It doesn't matter.

1031
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:10,582
His little scheme didn't work.
Did it, Ike? No, no.

1032
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:12,511
We're almost there.

1033
01:53:13,711 --> 01:53:16,636
What was it your poetry
file had to say?

1034
01:53:16,755 --> 01:53:20,890
I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep.

1035
01:53:23,721 --> 01:53:28,568
And miles to go before I sleep

1036
01:53:49,455 --> 01:53:51,456
Stop that chopper!

1037
01:54:20,694 --> 01:54:23,121
Punch it, dude. Don't be a pussy.

1038
01:54:25,574 --> 01:54:27,633
Thank you, Gary Jones.

1039
01:54:45,636 --> 01:54:48,138
Go up around the reservoir.

1040
01:54:48,139 --> 01:54:51,194
Aqueduct to Boston
starts in Shaft 12.

1041
01:55:14,248 --> 01:55:16,624
Patience, bambino.

1042
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:19,467
Just up ahead.

1043
01:55:33,726 --> 01:55:36,532
Shh....

1044
01:56:48,175 --> 01:56:52,025
Stay here and take
care of your friend.

1045
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:54,985
No matter what you hear.

1046
01:57:10,990 --> 01:57:13,000
So long, doctor.

1047
01:57:26,505 --> 01:57:28,882
Good doggy.

1048
01:57:28,883 --> 01:57:31,143
Good girl.

1049
01:59:27,168 --> 01:59:29,096
Shit!

1050
01:59:29,128 --> 01:59:31,388
You son of a bitch!

1051
01:59:51,317 --> 01:59:53,234
Wait.

1052
01:59:53,235 --> 01:59:55,164
Wait.

1053
02:00:26,769 --> 02:00:29,020
Go back to car, Duddie.

1054
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:31,329
You'll be safer there.

1055
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:17,705
Look out, Jonesy.

1056
02:01:44,054 --> 02:01:47,145
I knew you'd come, Henry.

1057
02:01:47,433 --> 02:01:49,809
I knew you wouldn't let me die.

1058
02:01:49,810 --> 02:01:53,032
Who the fuck are you?

1059
02:01:56,317 --> 02:02:00,083
- Don't you know me, H?
- I don't know.

1060
02:02:01,864 --> 02:02:04,908
I think I'm gonna have to shoot you.

1061
02:02:04,909 --> 02:02:06,789
Just to be sure.

1062
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:13,052
Well, maybe you're right, my friend.

1063
02:02:13,292 --> 02:02:17,142
I don't know myself
if Mr. Gray is gone.

1064
02:02:17,546 --> 02:02:21,100
He could be hiding
in here somewhere...

1065
02:02:21,592 --> 02:02:24,101
waiting for his chance.

1066
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:42,795
Tell me something Mr. Gray
couldn't possibly know.

1067
02:02:44,365 --> 02:02:47,123
Tell me something
only we would know.

1068
02:02:52,581 --> 02:02:55,304
SSDD.

1069
02:02:59,463 --> 02:03:01,771
Not good enough.

1070
02:03:05,094 --> 02:03:09,277
Well, you decide. Ask me anything.

1071
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:30,457
At Tracker Brothers,
day we met Duddits...

1072
02:03:31,579 --> 02:03:34,717
what was painted on the
wall by the window?

1073
02:03:47,428 --> 02:03:49,308
No...

1074
02:03:52,141 --> 02:03:53,986
bounce....

1075
02:04:03,527 --> 02:04:05,538
No play.

1076
02:04:08,449 --> 02:04:10,784
Hello...

1077
02:04:10,785 --> 02:04:12,713
Ister Gay.

1078
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:49,614
You.

1079
02:04:49,615 --> 02:04:52,884
Ooby-Ooby-Doo...

1080
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:56,085
we got some work to do now.

1081
02:05:08,843 --> 02:05:11,731
Ister Gay...

1082
02:05:11,762 --> 02:05:14,106
go away.

1083
02:05:51,385 --> 02:05:54,025
No!

1084
02:06:15,159 --> 02:06:18,214
I Duddits.

1085
02:07:41,495 --> 02:07:43,258
H?

1086
02:08:00,014 --> 02:08:01,894
Jonesy.

1087
02:08:07,354 --> 02:08:11,786
Jonesy, if that really
is your name....

1088
02:08:17,406 --> 02:08:20,544
- That'll be 50 small.
- Bullshit.

1089
02:08:22,578 --> 02:08:25,079
- I Duddits.
- I Duddits.

1090
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:27,624
They're my friends.
We're all best friends.

1091
02:08:27,625 --> 02:08:31,510
Here's to Duddits, our dreamcatcher.
