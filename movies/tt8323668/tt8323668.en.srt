00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:42,973
These are my friends,
Jerry and Marge Selbee.

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,050
They live in Evart, Michigan.

4
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:56,297
It's a small town that's
not exactly in its prime.

5
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,060
Though, to be honest,
neither are Jerry and Marge.

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,512
Today, they're on their way
to buy lottery tickets.

7
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:07,377
Lots and lots of lottery
tickets.

8
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:10,449
But they're not hoping
to get lucky.

9
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,246
You see, they don't need luck.

10
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:25,085
But this story
doesn't start there.

11
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:27,639
It starts with Jerry,

12
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:32,747
getting up before dawn just like
he has every day for 42 years,

13
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,129
going to work at
the Corn Flakes factory,

14
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:38,753
for what he fears
will be the last time.

15
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:41,273
It's a math problem, really.

16
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:44,034
If you count the letters, uh,

17
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,898
except the letter "I,"
which they skip

18
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,797
because it looks like a "1",

19
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,766
then you realize
that "J" is February.

20
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,493
And then, the last letter...

21
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:55,943
Oh, boy.

22
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,634
That designates the plant code,

23
00:01:57,738 --> 00:02:00,534
which was not easy
to figure out, but, uh...

24
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:03,537
I did.

25
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:07,230
Jerry,

26
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:09,439
you don't have to work
so hard. You're retiring.

27
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:12,511
Well, yeah. But... I...

28
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,893
I don't have to be. Um...

29
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:17,965
I know my line
is shutting down, but...

30
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:20,174
You know, I have a thing
with numbers.

31
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:21,727
Come on.

32
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:25,214
You've served your time.
These are your golden years.

33
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:28,286
He's the best line manager
we ever had, right?

34
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,632
Absolutely.

35
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:31,944
Hey. Why don't you
tell these guys

36
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:34,119
how you started
working here in high school?

37
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:37,571
You worked nights, right?

38
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,794
To Jerry.- All right.

39
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:56,486
Not everybody
can pull off 42 years

40
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,005
without getting fired.

41
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,904
And now you have a boss
who's going to let you sleep in.

42
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:02,975
And won't yell at me.

43
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,322
Wrong about that.Oh.

44
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,980
You know, you should get
your real estate license,

45
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,672
just like Howard did.

46
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:10,845
It's like having a job.

47
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:12,675
But it's also like
being retired,

48
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:14,504
because you don't do anything.

49
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:15,919
It's true.

50
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:17,583
Most days, I don't
even leave the house.

51
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,613
Well...

52
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,304
You know, I'll make it work.

53
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:24,031
You know, I can always help
Marge around the house.

54
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,791
No, you don't need to do that.

55
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,241
No, I'd be happy to.

56
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:29,588
I mean, you've been taking
care of this place for years.

57
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:30,865
I kind of have a system.

58
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,488
Oh, yeah, and a good one.

59
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:35,387
But, you know, every system
can use an improvement.

60
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:36,561
Oh, God. Here we go.

61
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,010
Hey. I got an idea. Yeah?

62
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:41,151
Why don't I try consulting
on some of your job sites?

63
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,740
You know, find ways of
making things run better.Ah.

64
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:46,087
You wanna walk around
on my construction site

65
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,504
and tell me what I'm
doing wrong? Oof.

66
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:49,677
I wouldn't charge much.

67
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,103
Oh, and I have
to pay you for this?

68
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:52,449
Darn right.- Are you going
to also come by

69
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:54,924
and teach my wife
how to grade papers?

70
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,306
Hey, Dad, if I lived here,
I would welcome that.

71
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,824
Thank you, Dawn.

72
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:00,128
I'm gonna take you up on that.

73
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,449
I'm gonna drive down
to Grand Rapids more often.

74
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,105
Oh, whoops.

75
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,209
You sold it too well.

76
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,498
Shut up. Backfired right in your face.

77
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:07,557
Yeah, sweetie? Okay.

78
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,869
Can we show Pop Pop?

79
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:11,492
Uh, yeah, you wanna show
Pop Pop right now?

80
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:12,769
Show me what?

81
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:15,393
We got you
a retirement present.- Surprise.

82
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,291
Okay.

83
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:18,913
Open your eyes.- Open.

84
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:20,708
Holy cow!

85
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,988
A fishing boat. What...

86
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:28,026
Do I like fishing?
I do? Okay. Yeah, you took me once.

87
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,649
Yeah, now you can
go whenever you want.

88
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:31,201
Yeah, how about that?

89
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:34,066
This is great.
Thank you.

90
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,828
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.- Oh, good.

91
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:38,105
Oh.- Dad likes it.

92
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,659
And you, for keeping a secret.

93
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:43,248
Thank you, pumpkin.

94
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:44,525
Thank you, Doug. You like it?

95
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:45,975
Yeah.- All right.

96
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,528
My goodness.

97
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:49,703
My goodness.- Good job.
You didn't spoil it.

98
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,395
That was your one job.
You did so good. You okay?

99
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:55,536
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

100
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,854
I don't have many
regular clothes.

101
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:04,856
It's all work shirts.

102
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,478
Well, we can
get you more clothes.

103
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:07,583
Hmm.

104
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,172
It'll be an adjustment.

105
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:13,105
You'll find your way.

106
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,797
Hmm.

107
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,143
Have you?

108
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:18,145
Not really.
But I don't have a boat.

109
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,183
You want this one?

110
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,771
Nope.

111
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,738
Morning, Leon. Morning, Jerry.

112
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:09,679
Card was declined, Helen.
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:13,373
Dang it. Maybe I
have cash. Let me just...

114
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:18,585
I know you're good for it.

115
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:19,793
Thanks, Leon.

116
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,704
What are you doing out here?

117
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:35,981
My appointment is at-00.

118
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:37,845
No, you said you'd come at-00.

119
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,296
I don't have any other
appointments. I have six clients.

120
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,435
Okay.

121
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,817
How do you make a living
with only six clients?

122
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,648
I don't. I just became an online
travel agent. See the posters?

123
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,065
Oh, yeah.

124
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,828
So, why do you need
posters if it's online?

125
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,588
Because they were free.

126
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:59,729
Why do you always have to understand
the reasoning behind everything?

127
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,006
Oh, well.

128
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,664
It's the only way
I can make sense of things.

129
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:05,908
How's the boat?

130
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:08,600
Water's still too cold.

131
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:11,914
You don't get in the water.
That's the point of the boat.

132
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:14,088
Hmm. How's my account?

133
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,642
Speaking of cold...

134
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:18,714
2% gains,

135
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:21,820
which doesn't sound
like much, because it isn't.

136
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,615
Look, you gotta
be more aggressive.

137
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:26,618
If you let me put that in stocks,
I could probably get you 10%.

138
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:30,035
That would double
your money in only...

139
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,175
7.27 years.

140
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,559
Literally the only time I was
going to get to use that today.

141
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:37,940
Nope.

142
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:39,459
This is all we've got.

143
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,219
And I'm not about
to gamble with it.

144
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:43,603
It's not gambling. It seems
like a risk, but the market...

145
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:47,605
Yeah, well, if you
could lose it, it's gambling.

146
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,445
I'll call you in a month
for my next appointment.

147
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,298
Don't need an appointment.Okay.

148
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:53,403
Take out the boat.

149
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,165
I may just do that.

150
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,713
Oh!

151
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:30,199
No.

152
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,659
Holy cow!

153
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,566
Hey, Jer.

154
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:58,917
What's a roll down?- It's
when the jackpot hits two million

155
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,436
and nobody gets six numbers.

156
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,472
Then the whole jackpot
rolls down

157
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,613
to the people
who got three or four...

158
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:05,959
Whatever.

159
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:07,374
Just better odds.

160
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:09,583
Good luck. Yeah.Thanks.

161
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:11,689
Better odds.

162
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,845
Can that be right?

163
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:07,814
All right.

164
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:17,927
It's not gambling.

165
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,862
The lottery? Yup. There's a way
to win every time.

166
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:22,967
Are you having a stroke?

167
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,278
There's a loophole

168
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:26,015
they didn't see, and it's
right here in the math.

169
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,937
Now, on a typical drawing,

170
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:32,424
you'd have a one in 54 chance
of hitting three out of six numbers,

171
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:35,911
and a one in 1,500
chance of hitting four.

172
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,360
Odds are you'll lose every time.

173
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:38,534
Not every time.

174
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,985
I won a free ticket
last week, which lost.

175
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:43,021
But on the roll down weeks,

176
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,885
the payouts to the lower numbers

177
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:49,303
increases above the amount
that you would pay to play.

178
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,306
So, the math is in your favor.

179
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:53,722
And they missed it.

180
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:55,585
I don't know what this says.

181
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,727
Looks like the numbers a crazy
man drew on his cell wall.

182
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,383
It means that
on the roll down weeks,

183
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,109
you're guaranteed to win.

184
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:03,870
That can't be true.

185
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:07,080
Why not? Because it's
the lottery, Jerry.

186
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:08,703
There's a building
of people in Detroit

187
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:11,809
whose job it is to know how
the numbers work. And they do.

188
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:16,365
I cannot believe
you are my accountant.

189
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,263
Part-time accountant.

190
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,541
Full-time online travel agent.

191
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,068
Hey, Mindy.

192
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,036
Hey, Jerry.
Making a deposit?

193
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,072
Uh, no... I...

194
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:38,111
I'd like to withdraw $2,000.

195
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:39,801
Yep.

196
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,703
So, how are your feet?

197
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,152
Been better.

198
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:46,636
Rolling the tennis ball helped,

199
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,191
until my manager tripped on it
and threw it into the street.

200
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:50,606
I can bring you another one.

201
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,815
They come in threes.Thanks.

202
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:58,579
Oh, thank you.

203
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:01,272
I'll be back in a couple
of days with a deposit.

204
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,583
Okay.

205
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:05,655
Oh.

206
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,004
Probably be 20% more than this.

207
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,108
Give or take.

208
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:11,592
See you then.Okay.

209
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,448
Thank you.

210
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,519
Okay. Have a good day.

211
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,078
Two thousand WinFall tickets.

212
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:51,771
Two thousand?

213
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,531
Yes, ma'am.

214
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:05,577
Good evening, folks, and welcome
to this week's WinFall lottery roll down.

215
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:09,305
Grab your tickets, have a seat
and let's get right to it.

216
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:12,550
The first lucky number is six.

217
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,517
The second number...

218
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:17,969
Twenty-three.

219
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,938
You okay? Oh, yeah. Never better.

220
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,873
Forty-three. So,
how'd it go with the boat?

221
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:26,806
Oh, uh...

222
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:31,051
They said they can fix the
motor, but it's not for me.

223
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:33,709
I mean, we're supposed to be
doing stuff together anyway, right?

224
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,469
Thirty-one.

225
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:37,309
You want to watch a movie?-
The next winning number is...

226
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,199
Oh... No, I didn't
mean right now.- Ten.

227
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:44,616
Well, so, when? Well, I don't know.

228
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,204
I'm watching a program.

229
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,136
You're watching this?

230
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,172
No.

231
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:07,294
Forty-three, 31, 10, and 32.

232
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:09,193
And we hope you're a winner.

233
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:11,126
One...

234
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,302
That's one's four.

235
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,788
Twenty-one, 28.

236
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:21,032
Sixteen.

237
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,564
Problem is, nobody knows
about this town.

238
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,292
Evart should start selling houses
for a dollar, like they do in Tuscany.

239
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:40,914
Lure people here.

240
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,916
We can live in Tuscany
for a dollar?

241
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,228
Well, a Euro.

242
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,470
That's a dollar.

243
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,507
No, a little more than that.

244
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,164
Jerry, how much is a Euro?

245
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,133
Jerry.

246
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:56,205
Oh.

247
00:14:57,034 --> 00:14:58,034
Sorry.

248
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,830
Mmm.

249
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:02,936
Full house.

250
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,145
We're playing gin.

251
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:06,629
Oh.

252
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,638
Thank you so much.- All right.
Well, goodnight.

253
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:17,054
Goodnight.- Take care.

254
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:19,194
Have a good
walk home.- Okay.

255
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:21,713
Gin, or poker, or cribbage,

256
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,760
I get confused by them all.-
You don't care. You don't care.

257
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:25,925
Scrabble.
Scrabblenext.

258
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,133
All right, night.

259
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,240
You're going to have
to tell me what's going on.

260
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:33,242
I'm too old to wait it out.

261
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:37,660
Oh...

262
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,043
I missed my chance.

263
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,220
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

264
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:47,291
Everything I had to do.

265
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:51,191
Now it's too late
to do anything else.

266
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:55,299
Oh, your life isn't over.

267
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:02,030
Everybody seems to think it is.

268
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:03,686
Well...

269
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:07,725
Heck, I can do anything.

270
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:10,693
I'd still be at the factory
if they didn't cut my line.

271
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:14,145
But instead...

272
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,356
These are my golden years.

273
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,463
Yeah, just because things didn't
work out the way you wanted,

274
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,465
doesn't mean they won't.

275
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,846
Good luck happens, same as bad.

276
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,059
What?

277
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:36,029
Good luck, it happens
same as bad?

278
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,998
Yeah. It's just math.Yeah.

279
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:42,277
What? Oh, man. What a dummy.

280
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:44,555
Not you. Me.

281
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:46,902
You're a genius.

282
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:50,216
Sample size.

283
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:54,185
That is where I went wrong.

284
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,809
I didn't calculate
the frequency of probability.

285
00:16:58,293 --> 00:16:59,294
It's just math.

286
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:01,261
Oh, I don't like math.

287
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:03,298
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

288
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:06,473
Here, let me show you...

289
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:08,751
Here. So,
if you take a coin

290
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:10,995
and you flipped it 1,000 times,

291
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,240
you might still get 60% heads.

292
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:20,763
But if you flipped it 5,000 times,
the probability gets closer to 50%.

293
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:24,905
The sample has to be large enough
to take luck out of the equation.

294
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,943
And this is for you.

295
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:31,326
Are you depositing a penny?

296
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:34,087
No. No.

297
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,468
No. Uh...

298
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,195
I wanna make a withdrawal.

299
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:41,336
$4,200.

300
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:44,684
Oh, and how much does
that leave us with?

301
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:46,996
I am checking.

302
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,000
A little over four.

303
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:52,415
Okay.

304
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,179
Make it six, then.

305
00:17:58,353 --> 00:17:59,388
Six? Mmm-hmm.

306
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:09,433
Eight?

307
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,574
Eight?$8,000.

308
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:14,403
Are you sure? Hmm.

309
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:18,683
Ninety-eight.

310
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,379
Ninety-nine.

311
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,107
Eight thousand.

312
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:31,558
Thank you, Midge.

313
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:33,250
There we go.

314
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,353
Bye-bye.

315
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,462
You know,
every town has a thing.

316
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:39,877
We need a thing.

317
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,775
What happened to jazz fest?

318
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,330
Well, we couldn't keep
the stage up to code.

319
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,711
Oh, one of those clogger
girls fell right through.

320
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,127
Oh, yeah.

321
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,507
Jazz fest made money, too.

322
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:52,441
I mean, not that year,
because the girl sued us.Yeah.

323
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,857
She was upset 'cause
we were still clapping.

324
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:56,859
We thought it was
part of the show.

325
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,171
Oh.

326
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,000
By the way, a bunch
of us are pooling money

327
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:02,175
for the lottery tonight.

328
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,729
They're doing that roll down
thing, where you can win more.

329
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,801
We're not lottery people.- That's probably
for the best.

330
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:09,779
You know, there are some
people who blow thousands

331
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:11,219
on those things?

332
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,841
You all right?- Here we go.

333
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,888
What's the matter?
Take the drink.- Down the wrong pipe.

334
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:15,913
Eating too fast.

335
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,123
Yeah.

336
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:23,264
Ooh.

337
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,165
Four.

338
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:45,252
Whoo.

339
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,493
I mean, it's like
a regular travel agent,

340
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,517
but it's online,

341
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:10,771
so people can act like animals

342
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:11,945
when something doesn't work out.

343
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,695
Hey, you should be traveling.

344
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:16,353
You and Wendy used to go on
all these cruises and come back

345
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:17,813
and call everything port
and starboard.

346
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,159
I didn't even
know which was which.

347
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:21,150
Depends which ocean you're on.

348
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,739
Hmm. No. No.- Yep.

349
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:25,534
She'd want you to have fun.

350
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:27,156
It's been three years.

351
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,193
Oh, brats. Brats
and burgers. All?

352
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:30,677
With
cheese on it.Okay.

353
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:32,092
Brats and... Oh.- Cheddar?

354
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:33,991
Doug, would you watch
the grill for a second?

355
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:36,062
See? This is
a good time. Huh?

356
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,857
Mmm. I told you it'd be
worth the drive.

357
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,080
No, you said you didn't know

358
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:40,653
how many weekends you have left.

359
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:41,930
Well, I don't.

360
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,105
Yeah, but the math works.

361
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:46,866
Drive for two hours,
get a free burger.

362
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,350
Offsets the cost of gas.

363
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:49,731
I don't eat meat, Dad.

364
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,388
Oh, right.
I'll get the chicken.

365
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,699
No, that's still meat.

366
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:54,080
Okay.

367
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,944
Is he okay?

368
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,741
He just doesn't know
the formula for "I miss you."

369
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:01,097
It is more fun when you're here.

370
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,676
I know, but you and Dad,
you gotta have fun together.

371
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:04,849
Yeah.

372
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:06,137
I know you've waited
a really long time

373
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:07,956
for him to retire. I know.

374
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,303
I know. We need to work on it.

375
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:13,582
I can't even remember
the last time that we had...

376
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,515
You know? What?

377
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,819
Yeah. Oh, no, that's okay.
I don't need to hear about...

378
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:19,554
Honey.

379
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:20,969
I'm gonna get a beer.

380
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,867
Okay? Okay. We'll work on it.

381
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,869
I'm thinking about it anyway.- Okay.

382
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,285
I wish he would.

383
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:29,495
Whoa.

384
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:31,082
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

385
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:33,844
No, Lizzy, Lizzy, Lizzy!
No, no, no, no, Liz.

386
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,915
Let's not...
Let's not open that.

387
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:38,331
Why? I want the popcorn. I know. I know.

388
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:41,507
But this... this popcorn's
very stale. Ugh.

389
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,474
I like stale.

390
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:46,581
Well, but this is full of
sugar. It's no good for you.

391
00:21:46,684 --> 00:21:49,446
I saw you eat seven Oreos.

392
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:51,931
You want an Oreo?

393
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,553
You ate them all, Pop Pop.

394
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:57,005
Okay. All right. Uh...

395
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,318
Let me just have it
for one minute.

396
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:01,596
Pop Pop will give it
back to you. I promise.

397
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,805
You trust Pop Pop now, right?

398
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,979
Let me just take one minute.

399
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,326
And I'll be right out.

400
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:23,652
Here you go.

401
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:26,068
Take. Thanks, Pop Pop.

402
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,208
Yep.

403
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:47,089
Something you wanna tell me?

404
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:49,368
What?

405
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:50,472
The pantry.

406
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,376
I'm playing the lottery.

407
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:01,483
I meant the empty bag of Oreos.

408
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:09,180
I'm playing the lottery,
and I'm winning.

409
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:12,460
I figured out the math,
and I won $15,000.

410
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:15,532
It's stuffed inside
the Frosted Mini-Wheats box.

411
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:17,775
Wow.

412
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:26,301
I gave $20 to
Shirley's lottery pool.

413
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,683
I guess it's not
such a big deal now.

414
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:32,203
I...

415
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:34,136
I had to try it.

416
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,898
I... I found this
flaw in the game,

417
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:40,004
and I had to find out
if I was right.

418
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:41,799
Well, why didn't
you just tell me?

419
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:45,527
I... felt silly.

420
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:49,358
We barely have enough money
to retire on as it is, and...

421
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:51,602
This is no time to risk it.

422
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:55,710
Yes, it is. What?

423
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:56,918
It's time to risk it.

424
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:58,264
Because right now we're losing

425
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:00,439
something that
matters even more.

426
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:03,821
I've waited 40 years
for it to be just us,

427
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:06,272
and so far
we kind of suck at it.

428
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:08,376
We have Jeopardy.

429
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,760
Oh, that's not
a thing. Jerry!

430
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,348
I wanna have fun.

431
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,282
I wanna have fun.

432
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,943
Let's be
a little stupid. Huh?

433
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:23,738
We got married when we were 17,

434
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:25,533
so we know how to do it.

435
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:28,225
Well, that's true.

436
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:32,229
We need something for us.

437
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:36,544
I didn't think it would
be playing the lottery,

438
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:40,479
but I'd rob a bank if it gave
us something to talk about.

439
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:42,584
Okay.

440
00:24:42,688 --> 00:24:45,898
$15,000?Yep.

441
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:51,282
If we bet the whole $15,000...

442
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:53,664
Oh, we should.
Let's bet it all. You think?

443
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:56,840
Yeah, 'cause I was thinking
the same thing. It's right...

444
00:24:56,943 --> 00:24:58,842
No. No,
no, no, no.

445
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:01,361
Leon, what happened to WinFall?

446
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:03,502
Oh, they...
they phased it out.

447
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:06,021
What? It's gone,
just like that?

448
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,644
You don't play anyway, do you?

449
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:10,612
No.Yeah, well, I guess
people will just

450
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:12,925
have to play the one
in Massachusetts now.

451
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,102
The math works. You can see
that. You're an accountant.

452
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:19,725
Yeah. I mean...

453
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:20,864
I mean, it looks right.

454
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:22,417
And Massachusetts
isn't that far.

455
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,076
No, it's only about a 10-hour
drive if our truck doesn't break down.

456
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,974
If it does, we'll get a ride.Yeah.

457
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:29,424
From whom?

458
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,564
Truckers. Yeah, they're always
looking for company.

459
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,911
To murder. We'll jump out
if it gets weird.

460
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:36,811
And they won't even know that
we have a duffle bag full of cash.

461
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:39,123
Yeah, we'll keep that zipped up.

462
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:41,678
All right. All right, what?

463
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:42,851
I'm in, too.

464
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:44,888
You sure?- No.

465
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:48,477
But what the hell? Put me in
for 1,000.

466
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,583
I just got a cruise
I gotta cancel now.

467
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:08,567
Hey. Oh.Oh. Got our dinner.

468
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,053
Yeah. We're going to need
three days of food.

469
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:13,675
Oh.

470
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,781
And I found us
a small town to play in.

471
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,404
Yeah, keep things quiet.

472
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:20,717
You know, like how
I park a block away

473
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,270
at a good garage sale.

474
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,754
Yeah? Oh.Move.

475
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,208
You got a ham radio? What?

476
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,210
Ham radio. We're gonna
hit some dead zones.

477
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:34,316
I suppose I can go to Ace... Wait a minute.

478
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,905
How are we on batteries?

479
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:39,252
Uh... I...

480
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:41,703
Ah.

481
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:45,673
Okay. Let's get some more.
Just in case.

482
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:47,813
Feels like we really
are robbing a bank.

483
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:51,264
Nah. It's gonna be
more fun. You take that.

484
00:26:51,368 --> 00:26:53,094
Here are the keys.

485
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:54,958
All right. Aah.

486
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:57,236
I got the coupons.

487
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:58,651
All right. You grab that.

488
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:00,722
Oh, now? Oh.

489
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:02,103
Let's go.Oh.

490
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,105
Can I get dressed first?

491
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:11,353
Mmm.Whoo.

492
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:12,803
You have cookies?

493
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,086
Ooh.

494
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:57,883
Doesn't look like much.

495
00:27:57,986 --> 00:28:01,093
Well, all we need is
a ticket machine, right?

496
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,583
Hey, kid, those are
buy one, get one free,

497
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,343
'cause they're so out of date.

498
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:11,759
They're from 2013,

499
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:14,900
but they'll still
turn your mouth blue.

500
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:18,489
Actually, I'm gonna
get them first.

501
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:20,457
How can I help you?

502
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,874
We'd like to buy
8,000 WinFall tickets.

503
00:28:25,842 --> 00:28:27,188
I'm gonna get you first.

504
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:32,089
No way is this enough.

505
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:34,747
There's no way that was enough.

506
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,369
Uh...

507
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:38,855
Eight thousand WinFall
tickets is, like...

508
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:41,927
$29,000.

509
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,688
No. 16,000.$16,000.

510
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,587
And that is how much we brought.

511
00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:52,800
Well, the machine prints 1,000
tickets an hour, so you'll be here all day.

512
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:55,492
And let me tell you from
experience, being here all day sucks.

513
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,046
Because I'm here all day.

514
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:03,914
Well, he's right. It's gonna
take eight hours.

515
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:06,572
I can do it. Let's get rolling.

516
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:10,576
You want us? Yeah, come on.
I got work to do.

517
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,165
I'm busy. Well, can you show us
how it works?

518
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:14,614
You'll figure it out.

519
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:16,996
Sorry, the motel's not so great.

520
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,309
The Pick and Shovel.

521
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:20,793
Perfect name.

522
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:23,589
Because it's what you
need to dig a grave.

523
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:26,350
Hah. Reminds me
of our wedding night.

524
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:27,904
Huh?

525
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:31,286
My dad gave me enough money
to take you to the prom.

526
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,013
But then I thought, "Heck,
the prom ends at midnight,

527
00:29:34,117 --> 00:29:36,636
"but a marriage,
that lasts forever.

528
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,328
"And it's 20 bucks cheaper."

529
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:40,848
Which you spent on a Days Inn.

530
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:43,712
Oh, on our honeymoon.Yeah.

531
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:47,544
Well, I'm glad
we're being crazy.

532
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:49,684
I'd sleep in the car
if I had to.

533
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,790
Well, you may have to.

534
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:54,344
I don't think this door locks.

535
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:57,174
Oh, it's on, Jerry. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

536
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:01,903
All right.

537
00:30:03,353 --> 00:30:05,079
Oh, you have the...

538
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:08,220
Cross those fingers, our
very last lucky number is 21.

539
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:14,226
Folks, those numbers, one more
time, are 23, 45, 01, 25, 06 and 21.

540
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:17,022
All right, folks, check those
numbers. We wish you the best of luck.

541
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,369
Hopefully this was your week.Okay.

542
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:28,827
Well, we got 8,000
tickets to check.

543
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:30,690
Let's get started.

544
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:32,796
We'll probably see sunrise.

545
00:30:56,026 --> 00:31:01,169
The last one
is a three-number winner.

546
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:03,102
Oh, good.

547
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,035
Okay.

548
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,661
So we bet 16,000.Mmm-hmm.

549
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,736
And the two number winners
just gives us free tickets,

550
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,291
so if we count those
as a push...

551
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:22,363
Which means we made...

552
00:31:23,502 --> 00:31:25,953
$21,043.

553
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:27,713
Oh...

554
00:31:27,816 --> 00:31:30,543
I think we're gonna
need more Oreos.

555
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:36,549
Yeah, we're all... No, heck.
There's a little piece left there for you.

556
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:39,242
No.You sure you don't...

557
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:40,657
No, thank you.

558
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:03,542
They just said,
"Congratulations." Huh.

559
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:05,026
Of course they did.

560
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,994
It's not against the rules
to buy tickets.

561
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:10,618
I thought an alarm would go
off and they'd start yelling at me.

562
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,723
So did I.

563
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:17,004
Do you really think
we're the only ones who know?

564
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:40,544
Hey, why are there ultrasonic
sensors on our toilet stalls?

565
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:42,098
Bathroom vacancy grid.

566
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:44,928
I got tired of walking in there
and seeing feet under every stall.

567
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:47,966
So, now I know that when
the light is green, the toilet is...

568
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,968
Well, not clean,
but nobody is sitting on it.

569
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:51,980
We're supposed to be doing
our research projects.

570
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,004
I am.

571
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,627
Bathroom lights? No. That'd be stupid.

572
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:55,891
I'm doing one on the lottery.

573
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,493
Ah. That's way
more stupid.

574
00:32:58,597 --> 00:32:59,874
It's not. I'm evaluating

575
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,429
the exact odds of winning
Power ball versus Mega Millions.

576
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,432
Okay. Yeah, it's stupid.
Whatever. I'll still get a B.

577
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:09,056
What are these?

578
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:11,851
The smaller state games.
I need them for comparison.

579
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:14,302
Sweet. The handicapped
stall is open.

580
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:53,824
Jerry, pull over.

581
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,345
Come on, pull over. We're
only a mile from home.

582
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:58,691
No.You can't hold it?

583
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:00,176
It's not that.

584
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:02,937
Okay. Okay.

585
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:23,337
Marge, how long
is this gonna take?

586
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,166
'Cause I actually have to go.

587
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,240
Did you ever think maybe the
world wasn't passing you by?

588
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:34,072
Maybe you were meant to be here.

589
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:36,971
To work in the factory

590
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,318
and to care about all these
people the way you do,

591
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:43,150
because the day would come
when you could help them.

592
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,775
What do you mean?

593
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,468
Well, you said the more
we bet, the better the odds.

594
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:07,967
I did say that.

595
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:16,562
So you wanna start
a corporation?

596
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,081
Bring in the whole town.

597
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:20,842
If we sell shares, we'll have
more capital to invest.

598
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:22,982
Go big or go home.

599
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:25,537
Then we'll split the profits
with the shareholders.

600
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,021
Everybody rides.

601
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,378
Will you stop talking like that?

602
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:30,335
Sorry. I'm just
really into it.

603
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:31,819
She's really into it.

604
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,269
Because she knows it'll work.

605
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:34,477
House always wins.

606
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,581
Stop it.

607
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:38,526
You really think
people will come in on this?

608
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,827
Yup. You did.

609
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,250
Yeah, but I'm a depressed
widower with nothing to live for.

610
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:44,935
You wanna buy
more shares, then? Yes!

611
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,559
And that about does it.

612
00:35:47,662 --> 00:35:49,181
Any questions?

613
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:53,047
So, uh, GS
Investment Strategies? That's right.

614
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,739
We've got a business license
and everything.

615
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:56,913
Not much of a name.

616
00:35:57,016 --> 00:35:58,363
Well, don't worry
about the name.

617
00:35:58,466 --> 00:35:59,946
You need "lottery"
in there somewhere.

618
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,435
Well, the name's not important.

619
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:05,301
It is if you wanna sell the
idea. I took a class on marketing.

620
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:10,651
Well, the idea sells itself. You buy a
share for $500 and you make a profit.

621
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,687
It's that simple. Do you have a logo?

622
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,482
Don't need a logo. Logos help.

623
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:16,484
I have a pig on a tractor.

624
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:21,972
Yeah. Okay, look, you all
have known me for years.

625
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:25,044
This will work,
and it'll help everybody.

626
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:26,667
What if we want in,

627
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,429
but we're behind on our bills,
and don't have enough for a share?

628
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,638
Do you accept other
forms of payment?

629
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:34,088
Like what?

630
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,620
Wait, wait, wait.

631
00:36:48,723 --> 00:36:50,104
Got it all right here.

632
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,864
Oh, we're in.

633
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:54,142
I've never done
anything criminal like this.

634
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,248
No, Shirley, it's not criminal.

635
00:36:56,352 --> 00:37:00,045
We're gonna pay taxes on all
the winnings and claim expenses.

636
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:02,358
Jerry's got it all worked out.

637
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:05,533
Your mother and I
are going into business.

638
00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:08,295
Are you selling her toffee
or something?

639
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:11,298
No. We're gonna play
the lottery.

640
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:14,266
It's 500 a share.Okay.

641
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,820
Oh, yeah? Okay?
You don't wanna know details?

642
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:19,064
No, no, no, I'm good.
It sounds great.

643
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,967
You can see in
the first three plays Dad, Dad.

644
00:37:20,997 --> 00:37:22,250
That we've increased our profit.

645
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,034
It's just not for me.

646
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:26,865
I just don't understand
this. It's just math.

647
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:28,798
It's always just math.

648
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:31,225
It's like sorting through coins,
looking for buffalo nickels,

649
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,078
because you had
calculated there was,

650
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:35,425
what, one in every
seven rolls or something?

651
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:37,634
Yeah. We made $600.

652
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:42,018
We sorted through coins every
weekend for a month. I was 12.

653
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:43,364
It was fun.

654
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:48,335
It would have been nice to just
throw the football or something.

655
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,166
Look, I'm...

656
00:37:53,926 --> 00:37:55,756
Hey, Doug?

657
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,079
Doug, the Porters lost power in their
barn and they want you to come take a look.

658
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,303
All right.
I'll be right there.

659
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:01,762
Okay. I gotta go.Okay. Yup.

660
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,252
I'll be in your business,
Pop Pop.

661
00:38:11,116 --> 00:38:13,774
How are you at logos? Good.

662
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,362
Well, come here and show
Pop Pop.

663
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:17,502
Here.

664
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,817
Let me give you some paper.

665
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:25,233
And you show me what you can do

666
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:28,478
about drawing a logo
for Pop Pop's business.

667
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:31,205
If you wanna get that going,
push your button.

668
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,689
Right there.
Push the button.

669
00:38:43,942 --> 00:38:46,600
Bill?- Hey, Jerry.
Hey, Marge.

670
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:48,395
Hi.

671
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:50,500
Hey, uh, if we're gonna
do this again,

672
00:38:50,604 --> 00:38:52,882
I'm gonna need to charge you
for using the microwave.

673
00:38:54,262 --> 00:38:57,335
We are betting 40,000.

674
00:38:58,059 --> 00:38:59,198
You guys drug dealers?

675
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:02,857
No. We're professional
lottery players.

676
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,411
I don't think that's a thing.

677
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:06,067
It is now.

678
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:09,485
Listen, as much as I'd like to see
if you can stand behind that thing

679
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:11,659
for that long
without breaking a hip,

680
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:14,323
there's no way you can buy that
many tickets before closing time.

681
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,077
Can you stay open later?

682
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,527
Oh, I'm afraid not.

683
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:22,049
I'm undergoing some marital
trauma at the moment.

684
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,465
Oh.Well, truth be told,

685
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:26,881
tonight is a drinking
celebration with my buddies.

686
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:30,644
Now, admittedly we do it out
there, in the parking lot,

687
00:39:30,747 --> 00:39:33,785
but, uh, I just can't have
customers in here.

688
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,407
It's a liability.

689
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:38,997
Well...

690
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,137
What if we weren't customers?

691
00:39:48,662 --> 00:39:50,560
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

692
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:54,668
What if we were partners?

693
00:39:54,771 --> 00:40:01,537
Bill, I'd like to introduce you
to GS Investment Strategies.

694
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:05,472
I'm in. Can I be in?

695
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:12,479
So I'm a shareholder, and I could
totally get you guys in if you want.

696
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:15,965
So, it's a WinFall,
so when the numbers...

697
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:19,969
Okay, you're an investor... Okay, let's
say you've got several hundred dollars.

698
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:25,353
Then there is these lottery
numbers. If they don't hit, you win.

699
00:40:26,147 --> 00:40:28,805
You in? You got any money?

700
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:31,739
I believe we are done.

701
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:34,432
Hey, I got two more
shareholders.

702
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:37,655
One of them's got to rob his parents'
house real quick, but he's definitely in.

703
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,197
That's 500 more tickets.Yup.

704
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,474
All right.

705
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:44,269
You want a bong hit real quick?

706
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:47,168
I don't know what that is.- Marge?

707
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:50,378
No thanks, Bill. All right. Ow!

708
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:57,247
Our next number is 46...

709
00:40:57,972 --> 00:40:59,698
Number 24...

710
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:03,702
And our very last number for
today is number 23.

711
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:07,844
So, one more time, those
numbers are 05, 21, 39, 46, 24, 23...

712
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:10,329
Okay, here we go.

713
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:13,332
No more
cigarette burns, huh? Yeah.

714
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:19,304
Well...

715
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:24,343
I guess we fire up some
of that delicious motel coffee

716
00:41:25,103 --> 00:41:27,105
and get started.

717
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,762
Or it could wait till morning.

718
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,695
Tomorrow?

719
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:47,263
Oh.

720
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:50,611
Hmm.

721
00:41:58,032 --> 00:41:59,517
The lottery?

722
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,242
Lottery winners get
a lot of clicks.

723
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:03,348
I don't do clicks. I do news.

724
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:06,454
Do you not see all these
empty cubicles?

725
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:09,527
Just poke around for something.

726
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:11,874
Find me a headline that I can

727
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:13,945
throw in the Spotlight section.

728
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:24,058
Hmm.

729
00:42:24,162 --> 00:42:28,822
Oh, nice thing about this mattress
is, we both roll to the center.

730
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,930
I don't think I can
get out if I tried.

731
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:35,656
Well, we have time.

732
00:42:37,382 --> 00:42:39,695
What? What the heck?

733
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:41,973
Hey, hey, all right, all right.

734
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,873
Got the wrong room.
Got the wrong room.

735
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:47,737
It came in! What did?

736
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:51,189
The lottery sends a tally of all
the winnings sold by the store.

737
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:54,744
WinFall tickets won $82,000.

738
00:42:56,228 --> 00:42:59,473
And how many WinFall tickets
did you sell at your store?

739
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,165
Just yours, plus six more. Yes!

740
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:03,960
To me. But those didn't win.

741
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:06,376
We doubled it. We doubled it.

742
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,275
We doubled it!

743
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,378
We doubled it!

744
00:43:10,553 --> 00:43:11,968
We doubled it!

745
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:56,806
Whoo!

746
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,059
It's Steve.

747
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:09,162
Hey, Steve.

748
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:10,717
Hey, Jerry.

749
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,306
I was just checking to see how
we did. Um, you know, curious.

750
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,827
I will be sending out an
official shareholder report.

751
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:20,658
Yeah, yeah, right, right,
but you know...

752
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:22,729
He wants to know.
What do you think?

753
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:28,942
Well, we doubled it.

754
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:30,045
We doubled it!

755
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,024
Shh.

756
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:08,164
This can't be real. I
didn't believe it either,

757
00:45:08,188 --> 00:45:11,398
but I've been running simulations
during the drawings, and it's right.

758
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,056
If you bet at least 10 grand,
the odds tilt towards the buyer.

759
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:16,379
Can you get money
from your dad? I'm not asking him for shit.

760
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:18,854
Why not? His name is on a
building. I think he can afford it.

761
00:45:18,957 --> 00:45:20,407
Because this is mine.

762
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,788
Do you have 10 grand? No.

763
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:25,274
I have a dorm.

764
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:26,724
Okay, that is one slice of pizza

765
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,242
per person. One slice.
Thank you.

766
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:30,866
Hey, only take a piece if
you contributed to the fund.

767
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:35,733
The first thing you learn at Harvard
is that you're here for your future.

768
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:37,596
Right?

769
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,115
Second thing you learn...

770
00:45:39,702 --> 00:45:41,117
Is that's all bullshit.

771
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,431
There is no future.

772
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:48,469
There is just now
waiting for you to take it.

773
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:52,439
I found a flaw in the lottery.

774
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:55,269
Okay? A way to beat
the game every time

775
00:45:55,373 --> 00:45:58,307
because nobody at the lottery
figured out what I did.

776
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:01,275
But it only works
if you can bet big.

777
00:46:01,379 --> 00:46:06,971
So, tell your parents that you
have new lab fees, or need books,

778
00:46:07,074 --> 00:46:08,904
or got an STD.

779
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:16,290
Whatever it takes, because if we
pull this off, then we are legends!

780
00:46:19,535 --> 00:46:23,815
Also, I'm gonna need you all
to fill out about 300 lottery slips,

781
00:46:23,919 --> 00:46:25,506
so we don't bet duplicates.

782
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,198
Here you go. That's for you.

783
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:29,234
Thank you.

784
00:46:32,479 --> 00:46:34,101
You're not filling any out?

785
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:36,103
No. I'm in charge.

786
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:41,695
Okay, talk to me.
So you wanna renovate it?

787
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,456
Yup. All the
shareholders are chipping in.

788
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,251
We're bringing back
the jazz festival.

789
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:49,496
The best music is the music
you make up as you go along.

790
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,775
Ah, I'm just sad we couldn't
have had it when Prince was around.

791
00:46:52,879 --> 00:46:54,363
He wouldn't have come, Howard.

792
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:55,882
We'll never know.

793
00:46:55,985 --> 00:46:58,308
You guys are sure this is what
you wanna do with your money?

794
00:46:58,332 --> 00:46:59,723
You don't wanna
invest it somewhere?

795
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:02,026
We are investing it somewhere.

796
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:06,132
All right.

797
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:08,687
I'll give you a hand. All right.

798
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:11,276
Doug, put it on top there.Yup. All right.

799
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:14,762
Thank you.

800
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:16,350
Wow.

801
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:18,697
Why do you keep all these?

802
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:20,216
The IRS.

803
00:47:21,114 --> 00:47:22,529
When we get audited,

804
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:25,394
we'll need a paper trail of all
the losing tickets we bought.

805
00:47:25,497 --> 00:47:27,120
Think you're gonna get audited?

806
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:28,397
Oh, yeah.

807
00:47:29,156 --> 00:47:30,606
Jesus.

808
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:34,610
You know, your group hired me to
fix the amphitheater. Six-month job.

809
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:37,751
Oh. How about that?

810
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,857
Yeah, how about that?

811
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,826
Well, you may wanna consider
chipping in on that.

812
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:45,552
What?

813
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,831
Well, you have a share.

814
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:51,869
You did, from the start.

815
00:47:54,078 --> 00:47:55,148
Dad...

816
00:47:57,426 --> 00:47:58,772
You didn't have to do that.

817
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,188
Oh, I didn't wanna count
nickels without you.

818
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:10,577
I'm telling you, Dottie has done
such a great job with this bookstore.

819
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,131
Yeah. You know,
Leon is renovating the hotel.

820
00:48:13,235 --> 00:48:15,789
Howard got him a deal on it,
but his commission is that

821
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,654
he and Shirley get to use the
hot tub whenever they want.

822
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:20,552
Leon will regret that.

823
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:21,968
You are not kidding.

824
00:48:22,071 --> 00:48:23,590
Hello,
hello, everybody.- Oh, hey!

825
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:29,423
All right.
Well, go ahead...

826
00:48:29,527 --> 00:48:31,632
Go on, sit on down.

827
00:48:31,736 --> 00:48:35,429
Uh... Uh...

828
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:37,017
Well...

829
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:41,332
Look, first off, I can say that
we're doing pretty darn well.

830
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:43,161
Yes.

831
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:47,234
Yeah. But you probably already know
that by reading your shareholder report...

832
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:48,856
I can't get mine to open.

833
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,341
Oh, do you have Word?

834
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:52,170
I have Windows, I think.

835
00:48:52,274 --> 00:48:54,138
I'll print you one, Shirley.

836
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:55,241
Oh, thank you.

837
00:48:55,277 --> 00:48:56,761
Anyhoo...

838
00:48:57,796 --> 00:48:59,867
As you might have imagined it,

839
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:03,630
we're gonna use the majority
of our capital for betting.

840
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:04,872
Yeah.

841
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:10,844
But there are dividends
that you can access.

842
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:16,056
Right. So, I know a lot of people would
like to see the jazz festival come back.

843
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:21,889
And, Old Frank can sure use a
mail truck he doesn't fall out of.

844
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:28,620
Uh, so, now on to
the profit ratios. We...

845
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:31,278
Yes, Raj? Is there not food
at this thing?

846
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:35,041
No. No. This is a shareholder
meeting. It's not a party.

847
00:49:35,144 --> 00:49:38,458
Then why did you have it at
- 00, when we all eat?

848
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:43,325
Well, you're welcome to
all go to the diner, but...

849
00:49:43,428 --> 00:49:46,500
No, then you're not gonna
learn about the numbers.

850
00:49:48,054 --> 00:49:50,056
So, what's the next play?

851
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,954
312,000 tickets.

852
00:49:52,058 --> 00:49:54,232
That's $600,000.- Yeah.

853
00:49:54,336 --> 00:49:57,822
We're betting half a million
in one play?

854
00:49:57,925 --> 00:49:59,548
Oh, the money is the easy part.

855
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:00,963
Is it? Yeah.

856
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:03,414
It'll take four days of betting,

857
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:05,795
two machines, 12 hours a day.

858
00:50:05,899 --> 00:50:08,074
Then why don't you
just bet the normal amount?

859
00:50:08,177 --> 00:50:09,247
Math.

860
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:10,559
It's Newton's law.

861
00:50:10,662 --> 00:50:13,734
If you push against something,
it's gonna push back.

862
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:15,460
And we discovered a flaw.

863
00:50:15,564 --> 00:50:20,155
But by using it, we've introduced
a variable that changes it.

864
00:50:20,258 --> 00:50:23,192
And we don't know how long
this game is gonna last.

865
00:50:23,296 --> 00:50:26,644
Then we need to make as much
money as we can, while we can.

866
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:31,062
Get the festival going, and finish
rebuilding before it pushes back.

867
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:32,236
Mmm-hmm.

868
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:33,799
I ordered a second machine
from the lottery,

869
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:35,422
but they said you're only
allowed one per location,

870
00:50:35,446 --> 00:50:37,724
so I was like, "Well, what
if I have a second store?"

871
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,830
They're like, "What's the address?" I
was like, "Uh-oh. There's my mistake."

872
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:43,143
And that's where
my buddy, Darryl, comes in.

873
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:46,077
And, uh, we're gonna give him
an extra share, but here you are.

874
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:50,012
You can print out 24 hours
a day, plus unlimited pie.

875
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,052
Look at this.

876
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:56,812
What's this?

877
00:50:56,915 --> 00:50:58,538
From my source
at the AG's office.

878
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:01,886
Now, the lottery has to disclose
players who claim more than 50 grand,

879
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:03,232
five times a year.

880
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:05,579
Sometimes the winners
are fronts, you know,

881
00:51:05,683 --> 00:51:09,100
cashing tickets for people who
owe child support, or have a warrant,

882
00:51:09,204 --> 00:51:12,690
but look at this guy.
Wins big every three weeks.

883
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:15,348
Lives in Michigan.
A retired factory worker.

884
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:16,625
No criminal record.

885
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:18,523
He's won this much? Yeah.

886
00:51:18,627 --> 00:51:22,803
Who drives 10 hours every month
to play the lottery in a different state?

887
00:51:22,907 --> 00:51:24,909
Yeah, that doesn't
make any sense.Right.

888
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,241
Loser!

889
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,629
Did that woman just rob you?

890
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:56,941
That's my wife.

891
00:51:58,563 --> 00:51:59,564
Wow.

892
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:02,636
Well, she certainly
seems spirited.

893
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,362
Yeah, she's a spitfire.

894
00:52:04,466 --> 00:52:07,193
No, she's just pissed off
'cause I filed for divorce,

895
00:52:07,296 --> 00:52:09,240
and she didn't ever think
I'd be able to afford it.

896
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:10,782
Huh.

897
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:13,406
Looks like money well spent.Yeah.

898
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:17,479
Kind of lost the magic ever
since Steely Dan stopped touring.

899
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:21,897
You know...

900
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,519
I need to find someone like you.

901
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:27,972
Only younger. Yeah, that started off great.

902
00:52:28,075 --> 00:52:32,494
No, I mean, you know, just
someone that's still fertile.

903
00:52:32,597 --> 00:52:34,634
And their womb can have babies.

904
00:52:34,737 --> 00:52:35,945
You're not good at this.

905
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:37,982
Oh, I'm really not.
Can you help me?

906
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,399
Well, my mother used to say,

907
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:43,643
"Kiss a few frogs, then when
you find your prince,

908
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:46,611
"you'll realize that the frogs are
better, 'cause they make you laugh."

909
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,444
Does laughing at you count?

910
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:53,584
Bill, you need a new frog.

911
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,172
I need a new frog.

912
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:58,451
$50,000.

913
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:02,834
Welcome to the now, bitches.

914
00:53:02,938 --> 00:53:04,802
We are going to make
a shitload of money,

915
00:53:04,905 --> 00:53:06,528
but it's going to take time,

916
00:53:06,631 --> 00:53:08,909
and sweat, and passion, okay?

917
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:11,981
So, everybody fill out
two stacks of slips.

918
00:53:12,085 --> 00:53:14,915
We need to get 25,000 in
in the next three weeks.

919
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:24,097
Something wrong?

920
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,547
There's another group.

921
00:53:25,823 --> 00:53:26,858
What?

922
00:53:26,962 --> 00:53:28,446
The payout should
have been bigger.

923
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,114
The only thing that makes sense
is another group eating into the pot,

924
00:53:31,138 --> 00:53:33,037
so I checked sales
at every store.

925
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,282
That's public information? No, I hacked
the state lottery.

926
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:37,765
Nice.

927
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:39,837
Wait. That's my laptop.

928
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,711
Yeah. You should destroy
your hard drive after this.

929
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:44,497
Dude.Whatever. It worked.

930
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,224
Look at the winnings in
Sunderland, from only two locations.

931
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:51,435
Two locations. They'd have to buy tickets
for a week to get those kind of numbers.

932
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,093
They're there right now.

933
00:54:13,905 --> 00:54:17,702
Hey. I finished early tonight.

934
00:54:18,116 --> 00:54:19,601
What's the rush?

935
00:54:19,704 --> 00:54:22,224
Oh...

936
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,608
You didn't think I'd forget
our anniversary, did you?

937
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:31,992
Oh, you just got that out
of the cooler. Well, yeah.

938
00:54:32,096 --> 00:54:35,686
But I hid it behind the Yoo-hoo this
morning so that nobody would get it.

939
00:54:41,036 --> 00:54:42,348
Whoo!

940
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:44,350
Wow.

941
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:46,490
You know it's good when
it does that.

942
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:50,494
Beautiful plastic china.

943
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:53,186
Here you go.

944
00:54:54,739 --> 00:54:57,086
Here's to 46 more years.

945
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:00,158
Cheers.

946
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,369
Ooh.

947
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:12,412
I think I still owe you
a prom night.

948
00:55:28,808 --> 00:55:31,397
This was easier when I was 16.

949
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:35,608
You're even more beautiful now.

950
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:38,507
That's the out-of-date
champagne talking.

951
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:41,959
Yeah, he really shouldn't
be selling that.

952
00:55:44,824 --> 00:55:46,377
Oh. Mmm.

953
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:49,656
No teacher to pull us apart.

954
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:02,151
You guys are the other group?

955
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:06,811
Oh, man. We thought it was gonna be,
like, a crime syndicate or something. Phew.

956
00:56:09,227 --> 00:56:10,919
I don't know what
you're talking about.

957
00:56:11,022 --> 00:56:14,612
Sorry, we are being super
rude. I'm Tyler, this is Eric.

958
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:16,269
We run a betting club
at Harvard.

959
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,098
We're called Random Industries,

960
00:56:18,202 --> 00:56:20,687
which is also the name
of my skateboard brand.

961
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:23,414
Well, I figured there'd
be somebody else.

962
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:28,695
Me, too, but I mean, I didn't expect
this. Look at you guys. It's like Up.

963
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:33,459
Would you like a glass
of champagne?

964
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:36,531
No, I only drink Jager
and Red Bull. But thank you.

965
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:40,949
Oh, well, at least you'll never
have to worry about being our age.

966
00:56:43,158 --> 00:56:46,851
Look, we're really only hurting each
other by playing at the same time,

967
00:56:46,955 --> 00:56:49,371
so here's a better offer.

968
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:53,099
You join my group,
add your capital to our pot,

969
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,790
and we'll handle
all the betting.

970
00:56:57,172 --> 00:56:59,277
Well, I don't know.

971
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,246
We kind of like to do
our own thing.

972
00:57:02,729 --> 00:57:03,834
What?

973
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:06,112
You'll get a cut without
having to do anything.

974
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:11,255
I have an army of bettors. You won't
even have to leave your rocking chairs.

975
00:57:11,911 --> 00:57:13,222
We're good.

976
00:57:13,326 --> 00:57:16,605
This is about making money.
You like money, right?

977
00:57:16,709 --> 00:57:20,195
Well, not as much
as I like other things.

978
00:57:20,298 --> 00:57:21,955
Oh, my God.

979
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:28,410
Uh, now, look, if you two don't
mind, this is our anniversary.

980
00:57:28,514 --> 00:57:33,242
And you are killing the
ambience of our liquor store.

981
00:57:33,346 --> 00:57:36,073
You're welcome to take
a Red Bull for the road.

982
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:38,662
Or maybe a juice box.

983
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:45,979
You're good at math.

984
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:48,534
Yay!

985
00:57:48,637 --> 00:57:50,677
I'm sure that helps out on
the farm, but at Harvard,

986
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:53,608
we learn a little something
called binomial distribution.

987
00:57:54,609 --> 00:57:56,265
Look it up.

988
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:58,830
Then you'll see why your odds are
better when you fill out your own slips.

989
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:00,477
You're welcome.

990
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:05,930
Binomial distribution
only considers two factors.

991
00:58:06,034 --> 00:58:09,002
Not a third, which is human
error, or a fourth,

992
00:58:09,106 --> 00:58:13,559
which is the time it takes
for you to fill in the tickets.

993
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:19,599
You gain a whooping 32 bucks
for every $100,000 you win.

994
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,499
You're welcome.

995
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:25,985
Seriously? Shut up!

996
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:31,438
What?

997
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:36,167
I guess it wouldn't be a prom
without dumb teenagers.

998
00:58:38,825 --> 00:58:41,759
That reminds me of
where we left off.

999
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:12,790
So I get the house?

1000
00:59:12,894 --> 00:59:14,516
Yes.
You get everything.

1001
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:19,590
Bill just wants to keep
his share of GS Strategies.

1002
00:59:19,694 --> 00:59:21,765
Whatever. I got the house.

1003
00:59:24,422 --> 00:59:26,908
Well, good luck to you, Candace.

1004
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:30,290
You know, we had a few good
years there before it all turned to shit.

1005
00:59:30,394 --> 00:59:32,430
And I hope you find your frog.

1006
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,398
Uh-huh.

1007
00:59:36,124 --> 00:59:39,541
Hey, what is GS whatever?

1008
00:59:39,645 --> 00:59:42,130
Oh, yeah. That's a little
company I'm a part of.

1009
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:43,649
Uh, we win the lottery
every month.

1010
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,383
See you around.

1011
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:06,982
I'd love to re-open
the ice cream shop.

1012
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:10,607
Well, now you can lease it
for $1.19 a year.

1013
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:13,368
And the Downtown fund
will cover the rest.

1014
01:00:13,471 --> 01:00:15,750
$1.19?Mmm-hmm.

1015
01:00:15,853 --> 01:00:19,132
Oh, it's a euro.
It's a complicated story.

1016
01:00:19,236 --> 01:00:20,824
Jerry can explain it to you.

1017
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:34,354
Boy, oh, boy.

1018
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:37,150
I just bought a Corvette.
Yeah, I can see that.

1019
01:00:37,254 --> 01:00:41,223
You want to take it for a ride next
week? I'm going on a cruise to Me-hi-co.

1020
01:00:41,327 --> 01:00:44,330
Oh, no, I don't think
I can get into it.

1021
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,815
All right, old man,
suit yourself.

1022
01:00:46,919 --> 01:00:48,058
There's another group.

1023
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:49,715
No.Yep.

1024
01:00:49,818 --> 01:00:52,131
Some kids from Harvard
figured it out.

1025
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:53,926
Well, that sucks.

1026
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,721
We should be okay.

1027
01:00:55,824 --> 01:01:00,104
We're still winning enough for people
to rebuild and get the jazz fest going.

1028
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:02,486
We just have to stay
in the game.

1029
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:05,075
And we will. Well, that's easy
for you to say.

1030
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:08,043
You're not standing at a
machine for five days straight.

1031
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:10,026
I said I would take a shift.

1032
01:01:10,114 --> 01:01:11,391
No, no. That's okay.

1033
01:01:11,495 --> 01:01:13,324
Yeah, because you guys
like it, right?

1034
01:01:13,428 --> 01:01:16,120
Yeah, we do. Yeah, you do.
Yeah, you do.

1035
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:19,537
So glad you got the day off.

1036
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:21,643
Well, it doesn't feel
like I did.- Oh, oh...

1037
01:01:21,747 --> 01:01:23,645
How did you guys do this
for weeks?

1038
01:01:23,749 --> 01:01:25,371
Because it's an adventure.

1039
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,235
Oh, no, this is
not an adventure.

1040
01:01:27,338 --> 01:01:31,480
It's getting paper cuts in a motel
filled with prostitutes and drug dealers.

1041
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:33,344
Oh.

1042
01:01:33,448 --> 01:01:35,277
Well, Dawn, you don't
have to do it.

1043
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:37,210
Oh, no, no,
I want to. I do.

1044
01:01:37,314 --> 01:01:41,111
I mean, I never get to spend time
with you guys, and, you know...

1045
01:01:41,214 --> 01:01:45,563
Feeling trapped in a gross
hotel, filling bins with losing tickets

1046
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:48,705
is just a memory
I will never ever forget.

1047
01:01:50,154 --> 01:01:52,881
Oops. This one's a winner.

1048
01:01:52,985 --> 01:01:56,989
Oh, you missed it.Okay.
I'm done. I'm done.

1049
01:01:57,092 --> 01:01:59,484
Hey, when's the part where
you get to turn in all the winners?

1050
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:02,442
Because I will do that. Well, that is fun.

1051
01:02:02,546 --> 01:02:05,756
We're gonna have to
double check all the...

1052
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,794
Is there a bar at this motel?

1053
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:18,700
Mr. Grazio?

1054
01:02:20,391 --> 01:02:22,704
Maya Jordon. Boston Globe.

1055
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:26,535
I had some questions
about the WinFall game.

1056
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:28,848
Well, Melanie Hawkins
handles our publicity.

1057
01:02:28,952 --> 01:02:31,678
But the game has been
a huge success for the state.

1058
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,577
Not just for the state.

1059
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,487
Are you aware there's a player in
Michigan winning millions every month?

1060
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:40,204
We raise a lot of money for schools,
but nobody does an article about that.

1061
01:02:40,308 --> 01:02:43,794
Some retiree gets lucky and
they send a Spotlight reporter?

1062
01:02:43,898 --> 01:02:45,865
I didn't say he was a retiree.

1063
01:02:47,418 --> 01:02:48,868
Yeah, well, you know,
it's a lottery.

1064
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:51,906
People win. So,
wouldn't call it news.

1065
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,942
I have a meeting.

1066
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:56,600
Thanks for your time.

1067
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,951
Morning, Leon.- Morning, Jerry.

1068
01:03:03,055 --> 01:03:05,505
Made you a fresh pot.
French roast.- Oh.

1069
01:03:05,609 --> 01:03:08,094
Wow. You're
getting fancy.

1070
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:27,596
Hey, Jerry.

1071
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,255
They said I'd find you here.

1072
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,567
What do you want?

1073
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,327
This won't take long.

1074
01:03:34,431 --> 01:03:36,329
We're not joining your group.

1075
01:03:36,433 --> 01:03:37,675
I don't want you to.

1076
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:40,195
I don't really need
your capital anymore.

1077
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:41,414
I just need you out of the game.

1078
01:03:41,438 --> 01:03:44,096
So, you're out. What?

1079
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:48,548
See, you're not really as good at
calculating people as you are numbers.

1080
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:53,139
So you haven't really run the math on
what somebody like me would do to win.

1081
01:04:00,181 --> 01:04:02,252
And what would you do?

1082
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:06,532
Set an army of the smartest
kids you've ever met against you

1083
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,258
and everyone you play with.

1084
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:14,057
We hacked into the state lottery
to find where you were betting.

1085
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:19,234
You don't think that we can
hack into your accounts?

1086
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:23,307
Your credit? Your identity?

1087
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:26,621
It won't be hard. I mean...

1088
01:04:26,724 --> 01:04:29,969
Most of them think a firewall is
something in their chimney, so...

1089
01:04:31,453 --> 01:04:33,800
Why are you doing this?

1090
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:36,942
It's just math.
Nothing personal.

1091
01:04:37,943 --> 01:04:40,393
Look, you had a good run.

1092
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:43,224
You made some cash for Mayberry.

1093
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:45,053
But it's over.

1094
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,298
Enjoy your golden years.

1095
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:09,215
Hey, so how many days
do you think we'll need?

1096
01:05:10,976 --> 01:05:12,115
None.

1097
01:05:12,978 --> 01:05:14,289
We're out of the game.

1098
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:19,432
Jerry!

1099
01:05:27,682 --> 01:05:29,718
Oh... Uh...

1100
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:33,930
Okay. Uh.

1101
01:05:35,379 --> 01:05:37,243
Oh, boy. Well, uh...

1102
01:05:37,347 --> 01:05:44,043
I'm sad to report that, due to
some new variables in the game...

1103
01:05:44,595 --> 01:05:45,838
Um...

1104
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,496
We're going to have
to stop playing.

1105
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:04,822
Um...

1106
01:06:05,892 --> 01:06:07,411
I am sorry.

1107
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:38,132
So, you're really going to let some college
smart ass take all this away from you?

1108
01:06:40,548 --> 01:06:44,172
The odds that he might do
something outweigh the benefits...

1109
01:06:44,276 --> 01:06:48,487
It's not about the math.
It's about being human.

1110
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,218
You know, Dad, I...

1111
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:58,876
I've watched you spend
so much of your life

1112
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:02,156
just being overlooked
and pushed around.

1113
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:06,539
Nobody knew what you could do.

1114
01:07:07,954 --> 01:07:09,232
Nobody cared.

1115
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:16,204
And then you finally took your
shot, and you brought us all with you.

1116
01:07:17,688 --> 01:07:21,278
You know what you did? You
made our little town feel big.

1117
01:07:22,693 --> 01:07:24,247
That's why they're all in there.

1118
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:27,940
That's why I was in there.

1119
01:07:45,544 --> 01:07:47,063
He'll be okay.

1120
01:07:54,346 --> 01:07:57,073
You know why
I don't like to fish?

1121
01:07:58,315 --> 01:07:59,454
No.

1122
01:08:00,697 --> 01:08:04,528
The last time that I went,
I took him with me.

1123
01:08:04,632 --> 01:08:08,325
He was 16, 17.

1124
01:08:10,396 --> 01:08:16,333
And I started calculating
how fast the bobber was moving

1125
01:08:16,437 --> 01:08:19,440
so I can figure out
the speed of the current.

1126
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,378
And then I hear him ask me,
"What do you think, Dad?"

1127
01:08:29,035 --> 01:08:33,281
And it was at that moment
that I realized

1128
01:08:33,385 --> 01:08:37,768
he was talking about
a girl that he liked.

1129
01:08:37,872 --> 01:08:39,184
And... Oh.

1130
01:08:40,392 --> 01:08:42,048
I had no idea.

1131
01:08:43,015 --> 01:08:44,223
You know, it's...

1132
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:48,503
It's never been a gift.
It's been a trick.

1133
01:08:50,056 --> 01:08:51,851
Your brain tells you

1134
01:08:51,955 --> 01:08:56,270
that you see what other's don't,

1135
01:08:56,373 --> 01:09:01,482
but in the end,
you're just seeing less.

1136
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,660
Uh...

1137
01:09:07,764 --> 01:09:11,250
I think I'll walk home tonight.

1138
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,820
All right, guys, it's gonna be a big
one. It's all of us now, so make it count.

1139
01:09:29,924 --> 01:09:31,408
Go, go, go.

1140
01:09:35,032 --> 01:09:36,551
Roll down's this weekend.

1141
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:41,004
Mmm-hmm. I know.

1142
01:09:52,049 --> 01:09:54,051
I'm just trying to do
the right thing.

1143
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:58,504
Oh, you always do.
I love that about you.

1144
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:02,094
And that's why everyone in
town trusts you to take a chance.

1145
01:10:03,337 --> 01:10:06,271
The one thing I have
never seen you do

1146
01:10:06,374 --> 01:10:09,895
is give up on a problem
before you find a solution.

1147
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:11,586
What do you mean?

1148
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:15,866
Well, you've calculated Tyler's
threat, and the value of the game,

1149
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:20,940
but binomial distribution
doesn't consider the third factor.

1150
01:10:21,044 --> 01:10:24,668
That as long as you and I have each
other, we are not afraid to be stupid.

1151
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:30,018
You're bat shit crazy.

1152
01:10:36,956 --> 01:10:38,544
Oh, there's Steve.

1153
01:10:40,995 --> 01:10:43,100
We're heading to Massachusetts.

1154
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:47,243
Ha-ha! I see you!
Go get 'em, boy!

1155
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:10,542
Whoa! Yeah, let's do this!
Marge! Give me five.

1156
01:11:10,645 --> 01:11:14,200
Jerry!
You're a madman. Pound me.

1157
01:11:17,445 --> 01:11:19,216
I thought it was supposed to
be more without the split.

1158
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:24,176
Did you check for
other claims? Yes. There was one.

1159
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,558
Where? Sunderland.

1160
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:28,249
Shit!

1161
01:11:28,353 --> 01:11:31,148
He called your bluff, okay? There's
nothing we can do but accept it.

1162
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:33,185
If there's a roll down,
he's going to play.

1163
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:37,120
Unless we create
the roll down. What?

1164
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:39,191
It takes weeks for
a roll down, right?

1165
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,883
I mean, WinFall takes
in 100 grand a day,

1166
01:11:41,987 --> 01:11:44,667
and then when it hits two million,
we know a roll down is coming in,

1167
01:11:44,748 --> 01:11:47,924
and everybody starts betting, and
Benjamin Button gets in his truck.

1168
01:11:48,027 --> 01:11:52,135
But if we create a roll down when
nobody expects it, we take it all.

1169
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:54,033
We squeeze the other
players out.

1170
01:11:54,137 --> 01:11:56,208
We use our hack
to track the pot,

1171
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,900
we wait for it to hit
a million before a drawing,

1172
01:11:59,004 --> 01:12:01,938
and then we bet a million in one
day. I mean, we own the game.

1173
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:04,872
And where do we get $1 million?

1174
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,257
As you can see
by our returns, it works.

1175
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:13,846
And with more capital,
we can control the game.

1176
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,503
Is your dad in on this?

1177
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,195
No. He... Um...

1178
01:12:18,299 --> 01:12:20,646
Thinks you're going to college?

1179
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,373
He thinks I'm studying
to be a lawyer, like him.

1180
01:12:23,477 --> 01:12:27,204
But last time I checked, my father
never made $1 million in a night.

1181
01:12:31,036 --> 01:12:32,658
We have 14 hours
to pull this off.

1182
01:12:32,762 --> 01:12:35,223
Get to your location and don't
leave until you print all your tickets.

1183
01:12:35,247 --> 01:12:38,492
Some locations might push back
on printing all day, but do not let them.

1184
01:12:38,595 --> 01:12:39,631
They work for us.

1185
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:40,735
Let's ride.

1186
01:12:40,839 --> 01:12:41,839
Yes!- Whoo!

1187
01:12:42,772 --> 01:12:43,772
Yeah.

1188
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:48,881
Hey. What happens
if somebody wins the jackpot

1189
01:12:48,985 --> 01:12:51,297
and we lose $1 million?

1190
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:54,439
Beyond dropping out of school
because I blew my entire tuition?

1191
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:57,901
I think one of those investors
might actually kill me.

1192
01:12:57,925 --> 01:12:59,927
Ooh.

1193
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,447
You all right?- Yeah, I got it.

1194
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,587
Oh. Okay.

1195
01:13:06,589 --> 01:13:07,693
I got the key.

1196
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:10,420
What the heck?

1197
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:12,767
Oh.

1198
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:14,251
Hey!

1199
01:13:15,252 --> 01:13:16,322
We missed it!

1200
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:19,049
What, someone actually
hit all six numbers?

1201
01:13:19,153 --> 01:13:20,396
No. No. It rolled down.

1202
01:13:20,499 --> 01:13:22,915
No, that's impossible.
It's only the second week.

1203
01:13:23,019 --> 01:13:24,814
It never rolls down
before three.

1204
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:27,195
It rolled down last night,
and we missed it.

1205
01:13:30,647 --> 01:13:33,201
The Harvard group
triggered it on their own.

1206
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:34,996
How would they know
how much to bet?

1207
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,171
The lottery doesn't post
the amount...

1208
01:13:37,274 --> 01:13:38,862
Well, they knew.

1209
01:13:39,863 --> 01:13:40,864
Jerry?

1210
01:13:43,488 --> 01:13:44,868
Where are you going, Jerry?

1211
01:13:47,112 --> 01:13:48,596
Jerry!

1212
01:14:21,077 --> 01:14:24,287
It's on the freakin' news. The
lottery didn't even see it coming.

1213
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,358
This is so epic.

1214
01:14:28,671 --> 01:14:29,775
Hey, Jerry.

1215
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:31,812
What, did you come ridin' in
on your tractor

1216
01:14:31,915 --> 01:14:33,296
to come give me a whoopin'?

1217
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:35,712
Believe me, I wanted to.

1218
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,853
Part of me still does.

1219
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,135
But then on the long drive here,

1220
01:14:45,239 --> 01:14:48,760
well, most of that just,
poof, went away.

1221
01:14:48,863 --> 01:14:52,488
And I realized that I wasn't
really angry at you.

1222
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:55,007
I'm disappointed.

1223
01:14:55,111 --> 01:14:56,699
Aw, you're disappointed in me?

1224
01:14:56,802 --> 01:14:59,011
No, not you.
You're insignificant.

1225
01:14:59,115 --> 01:15:05,501
No, I was disappointed that I let a
selfish kid like you get to me. Huh.

1226
01:15:05,604 --> 01:15:08,849
I was always good with math,

1227
01:15:08,952 --> 01:15:14,371
but it took a long time for me
to figure people out.

1228
01:15:14,475 --> 01:15:18,099
So, tell us, Jerry,
what did you figure out?

1229
01:15:18,203 --> 01:15:21,413
That the solution isn't numbers.

1230
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:27,315
You told me that I was playing the
lottery because I had nothing else.

1231
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:34,875
But the reason you won't share the
pot is because you have nothing else.

1232
01:15:34,978 --> 01:15:39,396
You think being the smartest
guy in the room is all that matters.

1233
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:44,988
But it turns out
it's this room that matters.

1234
01:15:45,092 --> 01:15:49,855
All these bright, young people
helping you get rich.

1235
01:15:52,271 --> 01:15:55,378
How are you helping them?

1236
01:15:55,481 --> 01:15:58,933
Guess you haven't
run the math out on that, huh?

1237
01:16:01,108 --> 01:16:04,456
Anyway... my tractor's running.

1238
01:16:08,702 --> 01:16:10,807
I wish you all the best of luck.

1239
01:16:20,645 --> 01:16:23,475
What? Just get
back to counting.

1240
01:16:25,477 --> 01:16:30,344
If the Harvard team can trigger
a roll down, they run the game.

1241
01:16:30,447 --> 01:16:32,001
So we trigger our own roll down.

1242
01:16:32,104 --> 01:16:33,692
Yeah, we have enough cash.

1243
01:16:33,796 --> 01:16:34,900
No.Why?

1244
01:16:35,004 --> 01:16:37,731
Because it's not fair
to the regular players.

1245
01:16:37,834 --> 01:16:39,491
He's right.
It's not who we are.

1246
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:40,734
But we're so close.

1247
01:16:40,837 --> 01:16:43,357
I mean, downtown is back,
the jazz fest is coming.

1248
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:46,060
If we keep winning, we could
actually hire somebody to play there.

1249
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:47,292
You should get Steely Dan.

1250
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,984
That is an amazing idea.
We should get Steely Dan.

1251
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:51,952
We can't win if we can't play.

1252
01:16:52,055 --> 01:16:53,505
Well, this just sucks.

1253
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,888
The lottery isn't stopping us,
but a bunch of college kids are?

1254
01:16:56,991 --> 01:17:00,408
Huh, that's a good point. What is? I wasn't
making a point.

1255
01:17:00,512 --> 01:17:03,653
Why isn't the lottery
stopping them?

1256
01:17:03,757 --> 01:17:06,207
It's because they don't care.

1257
01:17:07,243 --> 01:17:08,485
Oh.

1258
01:17:09,107 --> 01:17:10,487
That could be our answer.

1259
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,774
Always happy to meet with our
loyal players, Mr. and Mrs. Selbee.

1260
01:17:20,877 --> 01:17:24,156
Oh, please. "Jerry
and Marge" is fine.

1261
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:26,266
What can we help you with?

1262
01:17:26,331 --> 01:17:27,504
So here's the thing.

1263
01:17:27,608 --> 01:17:31,474
The state lottery was losing
money a few years ago,

1264
01:17:31,577 --> 01:17:33,718
and hardly anybody
was winning the jackpot,

1265
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:37,583
so Mega Millions ate your lunch.

1266
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:40,897
Then along comes WinFall,
and all that changes.

1267
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:43,037
You folks made millions,

1268
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:47,248
before you realized
there was a flaw in the math.

1269
01:17:48,215 --> 01:17:50,700
You probably panicked at first,

1270
01:17:50,804 --> 01:17:53,669
because you knew that
once everybody saw it,

1271
01:17:53,772 --> 01:17:56,188
that the game would collapse.

1272
01:17:56,292 --> 01:17:58,294
Except they didn't see it.

1273
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:01,711
Only me and a few kids
from Harvard.

1274
01:18:01,815 --> 01:18:05,094
Which meant that we were
pushing millions into the game,

1275
01:18:05,197 --> 01:18:08,235
and, boy, sent your profits
through the roof.

1276
01:18:09,788 --> 01:18:15,104
So, all of a sudden, your
mistake became your windfall.

1277
01:18:15,207 --> 01:18:16,484
I gave him that line.

1278
01:18:16,588 --> 01:18:18,970
Yeah, she sure did,
and it's a dandy.

1279
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:22,076
So, what exactly do you want?

1280
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:24,113
Transparency.

1281
01:18:24,216 --> 01:18:29,601
We'd like the website to show
the size of the jackpot.

1282
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,225
That prevents any group
from forcing a roll down.

1283
01:18:34,364 --> 01:18:37,264
Makes it fair for anybody
who plays.

1284
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:42,372
And we would like two machines
at the Liquor Hut in Sunderland.

1285
01:18:42,476 --> 01:18:43,960
So we can be together.

1286
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,239
These are our golden years.

1287
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:55,178
We'll take care of it.

1288
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:58,043
Yeah, we'll be making
another play soon.

1289
01:18:59,424 --> 01:19:03,117
That's great
to hear. Yeah. Talk soon.

1290
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:05,026
He's wants to bring in
other partners from the firm.

1291
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,707
Dude, we might not
ever need a real job.

1292
01:19:06,811 --> 01:19:08,502
They posted the jackpot. What?

1293
01:19:08,605 --> 01:19:12,437
The lottery changed the website.
You can track the jackpot online.

1294
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,025
We can't roll it down anymore.

1295
01:19:14,128 --> 01:19:16,130
Shit. Shit.

1296
01:19:17,097 --> 01:19:19,824
All right, let's break this guy.

1297
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,653
He wants a war?
We'll give him one.

1298
01:19:30,593 --> 01:19:33,976
You want some nachos? Uh, no.

1299
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:35,287
Yeah, I'll try some.

1300
01:19:38,428 --> 01:19:40,051
You know, I'm good.

1301
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:52,246
Where is everyone?
We're supposed to be betting.

1302
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:56,550
Dude, it's over.
Nobody wants to do it anymore.

1303
01:19:56,653 --> 01:19:58,034
What? Why? We're winning.

1304
01:19:58,138 --> 01:20:00,692
No. We're assholes.

1305
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,005
And that doesn't work
for anybody but you.

1306
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:07,216
Fine. I'll do it on my own.

1307
01:20:27,408 --> 01:20:28,824
It's gonna be insane.

1308
01:20:29,445 --> 01:20:30,826
Crazy.

1309
01:20:30,929 --> 01:20:33,138
I told you we should have...

1310
01:20:33,242 --> 01:20:34,899
Did you get
the pretzels?- Yeah.

1311
01:20:39,144 --> 01:20:41,422
This just came for you. Thank you.

1312
01:20:41,526 --> 01:20:43,183
Oh. Finally.

1313
01:20:44,391 --> 01:20:45,633
Paycheck?

1314
01:20:45,737 --> 01:20:48,188
Like I'd get excited about that.

1315
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:51,570
No. State lottery commission.

1316
01:20:51,674 --> 01:20:53,089
They don't want to talk to me,

1317
01:20:53,193 --> 01:20:56,334
but anybody that wins above
60,000 is in the public record.

1318
01:20:56,437 --> 01:20:58,129
You just have to
submit a request.

1319
01:20:58,232 --> 01:21:02,409
Which I did, for every drawing
in the last six months.

1320
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:07,069
Gerald Selbee,
every three weeks.

1321
01:21:10,106 --> 01:21:11,106
Mmm-hmm.

1322
01:21:11,832 --> 01:21:13,213
Tyler Langford.

1323
01:21:15,318 --> 01:21:16,423
Same drawings.

1324
01:21:17,493 --> 01:21:18,839
There's another one.

1325
01:21:21,221 --> 01:21:22,878
Huh.

1326
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:27,606
Tyler Langford.
Tyler Langford.

1327
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:30,713
Okay, Tyler Langford, I see you.

1328
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,581
Best euro I've ever spent.

1329
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:38,203
Thanks, Raj.- Thank you.

1330
01:21:38,307 --> 01:21:39,308
Okay, girl.

1331
01:21:44,244 --> 01:21:45,693
Darn!- Whoa!

1332
01:21:45,797 --> 01:21:47,385
Try one more time, sweetheart.

1333
01:21:47,488 --> 01:21:48,973
Like a kangaroo.

1334
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:51,389
Hey, would you
hand me a 10 mil? Yeah.

1335
01:21:53,253 --> 01:21:54,771
Ten mil.

1336
01:21:55,496 --> 01:21:56,808
Here you go. Thank you.

1337
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,672
You won't even buy
yourself a new truck?

1338
01:21:58,775 --> 01:22:00,398
Nah. This one works.

1339
01:22:00,501 --> 01:22:01,778
Does it?

1340
01:22:01,882 --> 01:22:04,885
Not all the time. But I think
that's why I like it.

1341
01:22:04,989 --> 01:22:05,989
Hmm.

1342
01:22:06,749 --> 01:22:08,026
You know what?

1343
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,511
I did buy this.

1344
01:22:16,483 --> 01:22:21,867
I counted nickels with you because
it was something I understood.

1345
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:27,701
I didn't know a better way
to spend time with you.

1346
01:22:27,804 --> 01:22:29,806
I just knew that I wanted to.

1347
01:22:34,915 --> 01:22:36,399
You know how it works?

1348
01:22:36,503 --> 01:22:40,956
Well, I assume you create
spin, which gives it a third axis,

1349
01:22:41,059 --> 01:22:44,373
so that the wind can
offset the gravity.

1350
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:48,066
Yeah, that's it.
Just like that.

1351
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,277
Wanna test that theory?

1352
01:22:52,381 --> 01:22:53,416
All right.

1353
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,073
Fingers on the laces.Yeah.

1354
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,388
Oh, well. Not bad.

1355
01:22:59,491 --> 01:23:02,356
I'll work it out. I know you will.

1356
01:23:03,737 --> 01:23:06,050
Oh, that's it.- Mr. Selbee?

1357
01:23:06,912 --> 01:23:09,122
Maya Jordon. Boston Globe.

1358
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:14,334
I'd like to ask you some questions
about GS Investment Strategies.

1359
01:23:16,508 --> 01:23:22,928
So, you and your wife count
tickets in a hotel room for 11 days?

1360
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:24,068
Yup.

1361
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:28,555
That's so much work.

1362
01:23:30,419 --> 01:23:31,799
Mmm.

1363
01:23:31,903 --> 01:23:34,319
It doesn't seem like work.

1364
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:36,425
I've worked all my life.

1365
01:23:37,288 --> 01:23:39,014
This is different.

1366
01:23:40,463 --> 01:23:42,431
This is very different.

1367
01:23:56,652 --> 01:23:58,481
You send it in yet?

1368
01:23:58,585 --> 01:24:00,587
They helped their entire town.

1369
01:24:01,657 --> 01:24:03,107
The flaw isn't the story.

1370
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,350
Well, this can't be
a puff piece.

1371
01:24:05,902 --> 01:24:07,214
I need a headline.

1372
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:20,296
Ah.

1373
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:25,612
Well, we do well on this one,
we won't need the game anymore.

1374
01:24:25,715 --> 01:24:26,923
You know, I was thinking,

1375
01:24:27,027 --> 01:24:29,305
if we're going to have
a fund for the town,

1376
01:24:29,409 --> 01:24:31,721
managing it, it's gonna be
a full-time job.

1377
01:24:31,825 --> 01:24:33,689
Well...

1378
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:38,487
Hey, you think we can get one of
those offices downtown, like Steve's?

1379
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,144
What?

1380
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:42,146
I already got us one
right next to his.

1381
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:43,802
You did? Yes!

1382
01:24:43,906 --> 01:24:47,116
In fact, his Corvette is actually
in one of our parking spots.

1383
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:49,222
Well, we'll have to
take care of that.

1384
01:24:49,325 --> 01:24:51,810
What? They're moving out
the WinFall machine.

1385
01:24:51,914 --> 01:24:53,329
Hey, hey! Hey. Hey!

1386
01:24:55,849 --> 01:24:59,749
Hey. Bill! Bill,
what happened?

1387
01:24:59,853 --> 01:25:01,820
The lottery suspended
our license.

1388
01:25:01,924 --> 01:25:04,064
Why? You didn't see the article?

1389
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:09,483
Oh.

1390
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:20,149
Hey, buddy. How's school? Uh, Dad.

1391
01:25:20,253 --> 01:25:22,255
What are you doing here? You're famous.

1392
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:26,224
Great move, genius.

1393
01:25:26,328 --> 01:25:28,640
Let's go. Pack up your stuff.
You're coming home.

1394
01:25:29,814 --> 01:25:31,126
Now.

1395
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:36,821
The high-volume betting groups
discovered a flaw in the game

1396
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:40,273
and took advantage of it, to
the tune of millions of dollars.

1397
01:25:40,376 --> 01:25:42,999
Lottery officials expressed
their surprise at the discovery

1398
01:25:43,103 --> 01:25:46,693
and announced they will phase
out the game after tonight's drawing.

1399
01:25:46,796 --> 01:25:48,488
Moving on to our next...

1400
01:25:48,591 --> 01:25:52,595
The last roll down was today.
You could've gotten your final win.

1401
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:59,015
Yes. But even if
we found a place to bet,

1402
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:01,294
it wouldn't have felt the same.

1403
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,645
It was more than
just a game to him.

1404
01:26:12,374 --> 01:26:15,687
He finally got to use his gift
to connect to people.

1405
01:26:26,491 --> 01:26:27,491
Jerry!

1406
01:26:28,597 --> 01:26:29,701
What?

1407
01:26:29,805 --> 01:26:31,127
The shareholders
are having a meeting tonight

1408
01:26:31,151 --> 01:26:33,636
and were wondering if
you could stop by.

1409
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:34,948
Are they upset?

1410
01:26:35,051 --> 01:26:37,088
If I told you that,
you wouldn't come.

1411
01:26:40,264 --> 01:26:42,714
I tried to answer all their
questions in the newsletter.

1412
01:26:42,818 --> 01:26:44,854
I don't think they know
how to open the newsletter.

1413
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:47,132
Well, they don't have to
worry about anything.

1414
01:26:47,236 --> 01:26:49,065
We didn't break any laws.

1415
01:26:52,345 --> 01:26:56,176
Holy... It's jazz fest? What?

1416
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,765
Jerry! Marge!- Huh.

1417
01:26:59,697 --> 01:27:01,526
Yeah!

1418
01:27:05,116 --> 01:27:06,738
Come on!

1419
01:27:06,842 --> 01:27:08,326
Let's do this!

1420
01:27:12,882 --> 01:27:15,851
Yeah! Okay, right?

1421
01:27:15,954 --> 01:27:18,267
Jer and Marge!

1422
01:27:18,371 --> 01:27:22,167
How did you...
We missed the final play.

1423
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:23,617
Oh, no, we did not.

1424
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:26,206
Yeah, everybody took a store,
Dad. All across the state.

1425
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:28,035
We had a bus and everything.

1426
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:29,830
What? Oh.

1427
01:27:29,934 --> 01:27:31,246
You didn't have to do that.

1428
01:27:31,349 --> 01:27:33,386
You did it for us.
Why wouldn't we do it for you?

01:27:33,489 --> 01:27:36,665
And don't worry, we left
you two the counting part.

Hey, Raj!

1431
01:27:43,465 --> 01:27:45,605
I would help,
but, uh, I can't count.

1432
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:49,436
Yes, you can. I can count.
I just don't like to count.

article, Jerry. It's all of us.

01:27:52,646 --> 01:27:54,924
And you brought this town
back from the dead

1435
01:27:55,028 --> 01:27:58,514
when nobody else could, because
you don't think we're just numbers.

Jerry and Marge
dissolved our betting group

1473
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:17,342
when the WinFall game
was phased out.

to start a construction loan business

Like many of their friends
and neighbors,

they also put their children and

Jerry did finally give in
and buy himself a new truck,

1481
01:30:39,537 --> 01:30:41,746
which was actually
slightly used,

1482
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:44,749
because he calculated
that was a smarter purchase.

1483
01:30:44,853 --> 01:30:46,233
And he would know.

1484
01:30:46,337 --> 01:30:52,964
His lottery calculation won
a grand total of $27 million.
