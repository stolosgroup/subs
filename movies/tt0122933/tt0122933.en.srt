1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,273
1957 was a big year.

3
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,109
The Russians put that Sputnik
into outer space.

4
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:55,237
The Dodgers played their last game
at Ebbets Field...

5
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:56,864
...and said goodbye to Brooklyn.

6
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:00,784
That guy, he shot Frank Costello
in the head and missed.

7
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:05,205
The Gallo brothers whacked
Albert Anastasia in that barbershop.

8
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:07,249
It was total chaos.

9
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:11,086
With Anastasia out, Vito Genovese
figures he's the big boss.

10
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:12,462
But Carlo Gambino...

11
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,923
...and Joe Bananas had other ideas.

12
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:17,050
So they called a meeting.

13
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:19,012
A big meeting.

14
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:32,609
It was the first time the whole
Commission would meet face to face.

15
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:35,778
Bosses and wiseguys were coming
from all over the country...

16
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:37,947
...and all
the New York families too.

17
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:40,742
Maybe 50 bosses,
the whole wiseguy world...

18
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:44,037
...all coming
to this little town upstate.

19
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:57,009
My father went with Dom Manetta
and Tommy D. Fat Tommy.

20
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,928
He was running the family then.

21
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:02,973
Some asshole thought it would be
a good idea to have this meeting...

22
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:06,477
...at Joe Barbara's farm,
up in the country, nice and quiet.

23
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,479
Get away from the car.

24
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,276
Want to be a fucking rib eye?
Get away from the car!

25
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:19,031
Turns out the local cops were
watching Joe Barbara like a hawk...

26
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:23,495
...and some deputy sheriff notices
all the traffic and calls the feds.

27
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:38,134
The meeting never even
got started.

28
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:39,803
The feds moved in...

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,265
...and bingo, the bosses,
they moved out.

30
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:05,412
My father and Dominic, they hid
in the field with some hay or corn...

31
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,163
...some kind of foliage, I don't know.

32
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,456
Along comes a farmer.

33
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,876
Dominic bullshits him
while my father holds out...

34
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:15,797
...this .44 cannon he used to carry,
and hijacked the tractor.

35
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:19,884
The story is they drove it
all the way to Bensonhurst...

36
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:23,681
...but my father told me they
only got as far as Poughkeepsie.

37
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:30,021
Carlo Gambino, he came out of it...

38
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,481
...capo di tutti capi,
boss of all bosses...

39
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:36,986
...and that was the last time
the Commission tried to meet until now.

40
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:49,248
I don't know, I don't like it.
What do we got to meet for?

41
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:52,461
Let everybody else worry about
their own business.

42
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,049
The '57 meeting was about how we were
going to divide this country.

43
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:00,302
This meeting is how we're
going to survive.

44
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:05,515
You got made guys
informing for the feds.

45
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,768
Bosses are going to jail.

46
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,103
People are getting whacked
without permission.

47
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,689
And on top of everything else...

48
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,649
...you got these Chinese...

49
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,402
...and these crazy Russians
to deal with.

50
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,154
Everything is changing.

51
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:22,074
We got to change with the times.

52
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,327
Are we going to get
a fucking Website?

53
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,496
When your papa died...

54
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:33,294
...I made him a promise
that I'd always look out for you.

55
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:37,006
I want you to come to
that meeting with me.

56
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:51,562
Listen. This guy, Primo Sindone,
you watch out for him.

57
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:53,481
He's a scumbag.

58
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:55,483
Keep your eye on him, okay?

59
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:02,031
Let me get a toothpick.
I'll be right there.

60
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:33,814
I just kept telling him
that I needed room...

61
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,524
...to grow...

62
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:40,696
...and to find myself as a person.

63
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:43,907
You know?
Not just as a woman...

64
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:46,994
...but as an independent entity.

65
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:50,664
Then I told him I needed to get
in touch with my uniqueness...

66
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,083
...but he could not handle that.

67
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,546
He said that I was
driving him away.

68
00:05:56,714 --> 00:06:00,550
He said I was driving him away.

69
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:04,846
Do you think I was
driving him away, Dr. Sobel?

70
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:08,766
Caroline, things end.

71
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:12,979
It's a part of life. It's how we deal
with things ending that's important.

72
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:14,439
I just cannot believe...

73
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:17,484
...that it's over between
me and Steve, you know?

74
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,903
I mean, maybe there's still hope.

75
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,655
He took out a restraining order
against you.

76
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,701
I have to be honest,
that's usually not a good sign.

77
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:28,120
But what should I do?

78
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:30,789
Well...

79
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,834
...the first thing that I think
you should do...

80
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:38,088
...is to stop whining about
this pathetic loser. For chrissakes!

81
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:40,049
You are a tragedy queen!

82
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:42,927
"Steve doesn't like me.
Steve doesn't respect me. "

83
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,262
Who gives a shit?
Get a fucking life!

84
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,475
Dr. Sobel?

85
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:53,229
Yes. Yes, I, uh...

86
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:56,774
I was reflecting on your situation.

87
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,235
It's interesting,
what you were saying.

88
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:00,819
I want you to think about it.

89
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,447
And I'm going to think about it.

90
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,032
We'll both think about it...

91
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,076
Okay.

92
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:10,120
- And continue next week
when I get back from vacation.

93
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,793
Caroline, what are you feeling?

94
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,629
You're just like Steve.
You just want to...

95
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,256
You just want to...

96
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:22,258
...get rid of me
and throw me out.

97
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,093
You know that's not true.

98
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:25,302
Yes, it's true.

99
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,971
I'll see you next week...

100
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:29,724
...whereas Steve never wants
to see you again.

101
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:40,610
Please, Mr. Vitti.

102
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,696
I said I don't know nothing,
but they don't believe me...

103
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:45,699
...because that time I said Little Joe
hit Dukey and he didn't.

104
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:48,743
I didn't know because Little Joe
looked just like that...

105
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,328
Shut the fuck up!

106
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:53,999
You know me, right?

107
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,208
You're Mr. Vitti.

108
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:57,419
You know what I'll do to you
if you lie?

109
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,715
You'll crack me on the head
with that pipe.

110
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,342
It's a rhetorical question,
you idiot.

111
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:06,220
I'll ask you one time only:
Who killed Dominic?

112
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,097
- Who killed Dominic?
- I don't know!

113
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:10,349
Who killed Dominic?
- I don't know!

114
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:11,517
I swear to God...

115
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:12,893
Don't fucking lie!

116
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,438
You little motherfucker!
Who killed Dom?

117
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:27,992
He don't know nothing.
Forget it.

118
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:36,460
That was relatively painless.

119
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:37,669
Shut the fuck up!

120
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:39,796
That hurt.

121
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,675
We're not going anywhere.

122
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:46,928
We've sat here for ten minutes.
I hate being late.

123
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:50,057
- I hate walking into that house late.
- Dad, relax.

124
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:53,560
You're like this because
you're mad we have to go to Grandpa's.

125
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,395
Please don't analyze me.

126
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:59,066
I can't be analyzed by somebody who,
until recently, believed in Santa.

127
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:02,027
There is one Dr. Sobel
in this family. Just one.

128
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,947
But there's two.
There's you and there's Grandpa.

129
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,451
You know what?
Let's talk about something else.

130
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:11,578
Okay.

131
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,622
Will you read
Grandpa's new book?

132
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,292
Mom says you won't
because you're jealous.

133
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:21,880
Does your mother talk about anything
else, or is it just me 24 hours a day?

134
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,548
Shit!

135
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:26,718
This is like voodoo, your mother
knows where I am every second.

136
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:32,558
Get in!

137
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:35,436
If I point to you,
make believe your neck hurts.

138
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,438
What are you, a moron?

139
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:39,399
I'm sorry.
This was my fault.

140
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:40,650
Did you see anything?

141
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,568
I was talking to my son.
Bullshit!

142
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:43,820
That's all right, sir.

143
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:46,447
It's our fault for
being in front of you.

144
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:48,116
No, really. Listen to me.

145
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:50,618
I'm responsible.
Here's my insurance information.

146
00:09:50,786 --> 00:09:52,662
It's okay. Forget about it.

147
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,498
Forget about...?
Your rear end is screwed up.

148
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,834
No, it was like that before.

149
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:01,547
Let's call the police
and file a report.

150
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:03,799
Fuck the police.

151
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,259
Hear me?

152
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,012
Okay. Fuck them.

153
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:11,306
You're right. Fuck them.

154
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,977
Especially those mounted cops
who leave big piles all over...

155
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:17,521
...and you just step in it
up to your shins.

156
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:19,356
Let me give you my card...

157
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:22,192
...in case you look at the damage
and change your mind.

158
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:24,194
You a doctor?

159
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:25,571
I'm a psychiatrist.

160
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:29,032
Oh. A shrink.
I talked to a shrink one time.

161
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,660
When I got sent upstate on a...

162
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,246
...fishing trip.

163
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:35,707
Jelly! Let's go! Come on.

164
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,293
I gotta go.

165
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,378
I'll see you.

166
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,342
Pings and knocks.

167
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,595
Cheap gas.
What are you going to do?

168
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,972
- Right.
Take it easy, doc.

169
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,682
Right.

170
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:58,313
I bet you showed the other kids how

171
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,690
I can see the judge's eyes

172
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,776
When he handed you the prize

173
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:05,737
I bet you made the cutest bow

174
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,447
Neurotics only!

175
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:11,659
You must have been a beautiful baby

176
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:14,204
'Cause baby, look at you now

177
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:15,955
Thank God for Prozac

178
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:20,668
Baby, look at you now

179
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,882
You're not coming?
I mean, this is my wedding.

180
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:29,177
We understand it's
a special day for you, Benny...

181
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:31,763
...but your father and I can't just
pick up and leave town...

182
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:34,058
...every time you decide
to get married.

183
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:36,393
Every time?
This is a once in a lifetime...

184
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:38,854
Twice in a lifetime thing, Mom.

185
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,941
Dad, you're not coming
to my wedding?

186
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,236
We want to, but I have
three book signings next weekend.

187
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:47,738
I can't piss off
these big bookstores.

188
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:51,450
If I cancel, they stick me on
the bottom shelves. That's how they are.

189
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,952
That's the word on the street.

190
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,454
Barnes is okay, but Noble is
a vindictive prick.

191
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,248
Ben. The language.

192
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:58,749
I'm sorry, but listen.

193
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:01,293
I have been alone for eight years.

194
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:04,714
I finally found somebody that
I want to spend my life with.

195
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,259
At least meet her
before we get married.

196
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,135
You are gonna be her family.

197
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,346
I think she should
know that up front.

198
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,056
You're being very hostile.

199
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,100
I was joking.

200
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,185
I think I'll go talk to the mayor.

201
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,104
The mayor is here?

202
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,439
What's wrong?

203
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,191
Nothing. Everything's fine.

204
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,943
How's your practice?

205
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,153
Excellent.
I have interesting patients.

206
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:30,282
Very interesting.
Fascinating, actually.

207
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,118
Dad has a patient who
dreams he shits trout.

208
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:35,955
Thanks, Mike.

209
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,835
The Manetta family is bound
to ask questions.

210
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,171
They think we put
the hit out on Dominic.

211
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,465
Forget Dominic.
They were after Paul.

212
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,135
It's a miracle you survived.
I just thank God.

213
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,262
Yeah, thank God, all right.

214
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:54,557
If it wasn't because I had to
go back for that toothpick...

215
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,934
...I'd be lying dead with Dominic,
God forbid.

216
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:58,477
May he rest in peace.

217
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,146
This is about the big meeting.

218
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:02,648
Primo Sindone wants to
run the whole show.

219
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:04,400
Primo's a boss.
He knows the rules.

220
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,321
He couldn't come after them unless
he had permission from the families.

221
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,782
If they did, we're headed for
one big war, I can tell you that.

222
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,952
Find out what you can.
We got two weeks.

223
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,955
God forbid the other
New York bosses are against us.

224
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:23,419
I want to know that
before I go into that meeting.

225
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:24,962
Sure.

226
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,006
You all right?
You don't look too good.

227
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,176
What's the matter?

228
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,679
I'm a little choked up.
I'm going to get some air.

229
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,349
Take it easy.
Take some air.

230
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,735
Paul...

231
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:48,528
...you all right?
- Yeah, I just...

232
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:50,322
What?

233
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,034
I feel like shit.

234
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:57,037
This whole thing is like
one big fucking headache.

235
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:59,581
You having one of them "mindgraines"?

236
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:05,337
Paul. Jimmy!

237
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:07,590
Let's go for a ride.
What's the matter?

238
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:09,842
Just drive the car.
What happened?

239
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:24,315
Good news, Mr. Evans.
Your heart is just fine.

240
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:25,900
"Just fine"?

241
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,237
But I had eight heart attacks
in the last three weeks.

242
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:32,240
Based on everything,
I'd say you had an anxiety attack.

243
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:33,574
A what?

244
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,451
An anxiety attack.
A panic attack.

245
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:36,744
I'll give you Xanax.

246
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:38,706
An anxiety attack?
What are you saying?

247
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:40,249
It's a common thing.

248
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,126
Hey, look at me.

249
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:44,628
Do I look like a guy who panics?

250
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:49,717
- Do I look like I panic?
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

251
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:53,345
Where'd you go to medical school?
I got a fucking heart attack.

252
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:56,140
Not according to your EKG.

253
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:10,446
Jelly, I need you to do
something for me as a friend.

254
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:11,613
Yeah, anything.

255
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:15,034
- I need you to find me a doctor.
- We just come from the doctor.

256
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:17,494
Not that kind of doctor.
Like a head doctor.

257
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:20,080
You going to change your face
like Sonny Black?

258
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,291
Don't get his nose.
He looks like a pig.

259
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,919
Not a plastic surgeon.
I got to spell everything out for you?

260
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:27,504
It saves time.

261
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:33,302
I mean, like a head doctor.
Like a psychiatrist.

262
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,636
Wow.

263
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:38,015
This is like one of them psychic,
ESPN...

264
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:40,727
...ESPN things, you know?

265
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:44,647
I just ran into a psychiatrist.
Actually, he ran into me.

266
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:47,400
- Was he any good?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:50,278
He seemed like a smart guy.
He had a business card.

268
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:53,656
A business card? Wow.
That's a real fucking achievement.

269
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:00,455
What do you need a shrink for?

270
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,540
It's not for me.
It's for my friend.

271
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,251
He has problems.
I'll ask the shrink questions...

272
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:07,212
...and get some answers
for my friend.

273
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:09,005
And nobody can know.
God forbid...

274
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,467
...somebody hears I been
talking to a shrink.

275
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:14,428
It could be interpreted wrong.
Know what I mean?

276
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,680
No one will ever know.

277
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:19,809
- Could I just ask one question?
- Go ahead.

278
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:21,560
This friend...

279
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:22,978
...is it me?

280
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:26,690
Yeah, it's you.

281
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:33,072
Carl, I'm detecting a pattern.
You settle too easily for things.

282
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:35,533
You're right. I do.

283
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,786
See, you just did it again.

284
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:41,873
I suggested something
and you immediately agreed.

285
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,334
You're right. I did.

286
00:16:44,544 --> 00:16:45,877
Why do you do this?

287
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:47,546
I don't know.

288
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:51,049
I think it's your fear
of rejection or disapproval.

289
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:53,552
You don't have to worry about that.

290
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,595
Be your own man. Stand your ground.

291
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:58,473
You don't have to let people roll over you.

292
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,892
- Dr. Sobel?
- Excuse me, we're in session.

293
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,061
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

294
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,690
I know you.
You're the guy I hit last night.

295
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,817
Bingo. Get out of here.

296
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,736
Upsy-daisy. Got a coat, nutbar?

297
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:12,988
- What are you doing?
- He's leaving.

298
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,991
He's not going till
he's done with his session.

299
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:18,493
- I'll give you $100 to leave.
- Don't take it.

300
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:19,953
- Make it $150.
- Listen.

301
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:21,580
- Three hundred.
Carl.

302
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:23,456
He ain't that fucking crazy.

303
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,959
You were right. I stood my ground.

304
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:28,420
This was the wrong time.
- I got him up from $150.

305
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,380
- I'm proud of you.
- I feel like a new man.

306
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,798
I'm so happy.

307
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:35,177
I know you're upset about the car,
but you can't come in here.

308
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:37,429
This is a patient's private session.

309
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:41,808
You know me?

310
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:44,103
- Yes.
- No, you don't.

311
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,442
You see my picture in the paper?

312
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,110
- Yes.
- No, you didn't.

313
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,362
I don't even get the paper.

314
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,870
Jelly, wait outside.

315
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,581
Sit down.

316
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,380
- You ain't got no bugs in here?
- Bugs?

317
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,134
Bugs. Recording equipment.

318
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,970
No. I don't record. I take notes.

319
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,142
I tried to give him the insurance
information several times.

320
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,978
Seriously, several times.
He wouldn't take it.

321
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,980
Please don't kill me.

322
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,775
I was going to ask you
if you liked Tony Bennett.

323
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,654
I'm a big Tony Bennett fan.

324
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,907
- Me too.
- I like all Italian singers.

325
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,369
Mr. Vitti,
I know it's not your fault...

326
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,372
...but shouldn't we take this up
with our insurance companies?

327
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,875
It ain't about that.
I don't care about the car.

328
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:48,169
I got a friend of mine...

329
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:52,340
He's got problems, and he'll
have to probably see a shrink.

330
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,300
So I'll ask you
a couple of questions.

331
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,427
Oh. Go ahead, then.

332
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,431
What do we do?
What, we sit?

333
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,392
Whatever makes you comfortable.

334
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,685
I'll sit over here.

335
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,355
I'm going to sit here.

336
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,732
If you're comfortable, it's fine.

337
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,283
So who starts?

338
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,536
Tell me why you think
you need therapy.

339
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,498
I don't need therapy.
I told you that. It's for my friend.

340
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,458
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't hear me say that?

341
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,668
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,755
You're supposed to be good at listening.
You can't remember what I said?

343
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,173
So sorry.

344
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:37,927
I ain't thrilled with the level of service
up to this point.

345
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,431
- That was my fault. I apologize.
- Yeah.

346
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,058
Why don't we start over?

347
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,729
Why don't you just tell me
about your friend?

348
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:52,568
This friend, you know,
he's a very powerful guy.

349
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:54,445
Never had trouble
dealing with nothing.

350
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,989
All of a sudden, he's falling apart...

351
00:19:57,157 --> 00:20:00,075
...he cries for no reason,
he can't sleep...

352
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:02,077
...he can't be with his friends.

353
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:04,663
All of a sudden,
he gets nervous around them.

354
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:06,498
He wants to get away from them.

355
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,710
And these are guys he knows
his whole life, you know?

356
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,837
And then he has these attacks.

357
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:16,133
He can't breathe, he gets dizzy...

358
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:18,678
...chest pains, you know...

359
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,598
He thinks he's gonna
die or something.

360
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:22,974
Panic attacks.

361
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:24,976
What's it with you guys
and panic attacks?

362
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:28,104
Who said "panic"?
Who said "panic"?

363
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,397
Not panic.

364
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:32,108
Dizzy, chest-breathing,
constricting...

365
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:34,110
...attacks.

366
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:37,989
This guy, he just wants to know
what he can do to make it stop.

367
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,870
Mr. Vitti,
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

368
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:47,792
I think your friend...

369
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,169
...is you.

370
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:58,511
You. You...

371
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,555
You got a gift, my friend.

372
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:03,891
You got a gift.

373
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:05,476
Oh, yeah.

374
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:08,437
You saw that there was something
I was trying to do...

375
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:11,190
...and figured it out.
That's why you are who you are.

376
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,609
God bless you.
You got a fucking gift.

377
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:17,530
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

378
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:20,533
Go on.

379
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,827
- What?
- Go on.

380
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:24,286
I think...

381
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:26,831
...medication could help.

382
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:28,207
Drugs?

383
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,251
Can't do drugs.
I don't do drugs.

384
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:34,004
If you want to get to
the root of the problem...

385
00:21:34,172 --> 00:21:36,006
...you'll want to get
some form of therapy.

386
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:38,217
Like what?
With you or something?

387
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:41,512
Me? No, I don't think you want...

388
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:44,473
My roster of patients is full.

389
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:48,227
I'm full right now.
Plus, I'm leaving on a short vacation.

390
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,729
Where you going?

391
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:52,107
- I don't share that with patients.
- Where?

392
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:54,901
Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel
in Miami Beach.

393
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,653
That wasn't so hard, was it?

394
00:21:56,863 --> 00:21:58,363
No, it wasn't.

395
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:04,077
You know, it's a funny
kind of a thing...

396
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:07,539
...but I feel better after
I got all that off my chest.

397
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:09,291
I feel like a load...

398
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,460
...a load is off my shoulders.

399
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,296
- You're good.
- I...

400
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:15,672
Doc, thank you.

401
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:18,467
- I didn't do anything.
- You did.

402
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:19,968
- I did nothing.
- You did too.

403
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:22,430
The load, gone. Where is it?

404
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:23,931
Don't know.

405
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:26,726
You're good. Nah, nah.

406
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,728
You're good, Doc.

407
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:31,022
I'll be getting in touch with you.

408
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:33,566
- Don't, please.
- One more thing.

409
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:35,568
If I talk to you...

410
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:39,572
...and you turn me into a fag,
I'll kill you. Understand?

411
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,283
Could we define "fag"?
Because some feelings...

412
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,785
...may come up.
- I go fag, you die. Got it?

413
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,913
Simple.

414
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,331
You're good, Doc.

415
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,416
You're good.

416
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,963
See you, Doc.

417
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:10,103
We take on Manetta,
what does Vitti do? Nothing.

418
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:11,605
Why doesn't he move?

419
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:12,898
Fuck him.

420
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:15,901
You say "fuck him,"
but he's planning something big.

421
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,236
This shit's coming down.

422
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:19,279
Well then,
let it come down.

423
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:21,114
Let me tell you,
Vitti's a tough guy...

424
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:24,993
...but a lot of tough guys get fed to
the crabs off Red Hook.

425
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:28,830
Vitti. That name has been
haunting me since I was a kid.

426
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,959
Growing up, he was the smart guy,
I was the dope.

427
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:35,254
My father was a nickel-and-dime
shitheel, his had it all.

428
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:37,631
Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin...

429
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,884
...because he forgot to kill
Gambino before the meeting.

430
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:44,012
I won't make that same mistake.
I want Paul Vitti dead!

431
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,849
You hear me? I want him dead.
Not breathing now. Dead!

432
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:49,977
Okay, okay, okay.

433
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:51,895
Like the pants?

434
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,731
They look great.
He's some tailor.

435
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:56,568
- I'll tell you. Look good.
- I like them.

436
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,909
Don't leave food in your room.
I won't come home to a science fair.

437
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,578
I didn't.

438
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,831
- Dad, one thing, though.
- Yeah?

439
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:11,416
- "I go fag, you die. "
- That's it.

440
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,209
I'm sealing the vent
in your room.

441
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,169
You cannot listen to my sessions!

442
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:17,964
It's so cool.
Was that really Paul Vitti?

443
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:21,426
I didn't ask to see his
Mafia decoder ring, but it was him.

444
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:24,763
- Are you going to treat him?
- Of course not. Are you crazy?

445
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:29,184
And, Michael, you cannot tell anybody
that he was here. Understand?

446
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:31,186
- Should I take it off the Internet?
- What?

447
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:33,063
- Michael!
- I'm kidding.

448
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,615
Despite the heat
and the popularity...

449
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,700
...of more exotic Caribbean destinations...

450
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:48,120
...Florida's hospitality industry
reports booming business...

451
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,080
...from Orlando to the Keys.

452
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,624
Judging from the mob...

453
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,167
...around the pool here today...

454
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:57,422
...there's nothing off about the off-season
in Miami Beach this summer.

455
00:24:57,632 --> 00:25:01,926
On a personal note,
this is my last report for WVBF.

456
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,971
I'm marrying a wonderful man,
and I'm moving to New York.

457
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:06,890
Thanks for everything, Miami.

458
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:10,977
For the last time, this is
Laura MacNamara for WVBF.

459
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:13,730
Catch!

460
00:25:16,192 --> 00:25:17,484
We're clear! Nice, Laura.

461
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:19,277
Okay.

462
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,821
- Ben!
- Hi.

463
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,620
Everybody! This is him!
This is the guy!

464
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:29,871
Hi.

465
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,499
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

466
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,834
- Michael, say hi.
- Hi, Laura.

467
00:25:35,044 --> 00:25:37,253
Hi, Michael. How are you?

468
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:40,048
You want to go
look at the camera?

469
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:42,425
Why would I want to go
look at the camera?

470
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:46,846
- Oh, yeah. Is it okay?
Yeah, go ahead.

471
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:50,266
Don't worry if you break anything.
I'm out of here.

472
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:54,938
- You think he likes me?
- He's crazy about you. No, he is.

473
00:25:55,147 --> 00:25:57,233
I love you.
I'm so glad to be with you.

474
00:25:57,609 --> 00:25:59,944
Do you really?
And do you really love me?

475
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:02,113
Of course. What's the matter?

476
00:26:02,823 --> 00:26:04,699
- I'm nervous.
- Why?

477
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:07,785
Because I'm going to be
a stepmom to a grown kid...

478
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:09,370
...and we're getting married.

479
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:11,455
So, what are you worried about?

480
00:26:11,623 --> 00:26:13,874
What if you get tired of me?

481
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:16,377
A lot of couples are very happy
and then they marry...

482
00:26:16,628 --> 00:26:18,879
...and completely lose interest
in each other.

483
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:20,840
That won't happen to us.

484
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:37,899
Is everything okay, Paul?

485
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:40,736
Will you stop talking?
I'm trying to do this here.

486
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:43,864
You seem distracted.
- I am.

487
00:26:44,073 --> 00:26:45,240
I got things on my mind.

488
00:26:45,491 --> 00:26:47,659
- Would you stop talking?
- I'm sorry.

489
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:48,910
Lie down.

490
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:53,665
Thinking about your wife?

491
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:57,670
I wasn't thinking about my wife.
What are you talking about?

492
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:59,213
Sorry.

493
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:09,515
Now I am thinking about my wife.

494
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:12,477
Sheila, why can't you
keep your mouth shut?

495
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:14,187
Sorry.

496
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:22,528
Dr. Sobel.

497
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:26,365
Dr. Sobel.

498
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:30,286
- Mom?
- Dr. Sobel.

499
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:33,414
It's me.

500
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:36,375
Mr. Vitti wants to see you.
I got your robe.

501
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:42,840
I got news for you, you two-bit prick,
son-of-a-bitch rat bastard...

502
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,093
...you did nothing for me!
Whatever you did, it didn't take.

503
00:27:46,303 --> 00:27:48,554
I'm still fucked up.
You did nothing for me!

504
00:27:48,764 --> 00:27:52,141
I did nothing for you?
I saw you for five minutes.

505
00:27:52,392 --> 00:27:53,684
What do you expect?

506
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:57,146
I can't work miracles.
Let me tell you something else.

507
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:59,817
I don't like it when someone
breaks in...

508
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:02,069
...and kidnaps me
in the middle of the night!

509
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:03,821
I have a family. I have a life.

510
00:28:04,072 --> 00:28:05,739
And I have a serious practice.

511
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:08,492
And I don't have time for your bullshit!

512
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:11,411
That got away from me
at the end there.

513
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,166
I couldn't get it up last night.

514
00:28:17,418 --> 00:28:18,627
Do you mean sexually?

515
00:28:18,837 --> 00:28:20,671
I mean for the game
against Michigan State.

516
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,131
Of course, sexually!
What's the matter with you?

517
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,758
Can I get this straight?

518
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:28,345
You flew 1500 miles,
you dragged me out of bed...

519
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:30,640
...because you couldn't get
an erection?

520
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,142
Don't that prove I'm motivated?

521
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,019
You can take a pill for that.

522
00:28:35,187 --> 00:28:36,229
That's a cheat.

523
00:28:36,438 --> 00:28:38,898
You start with the pills,
next it's hydraulics.

524
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:42,068
A hard-on should be gotten
legitimately or not at all.

525
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:44,028
I think Mark Twain said that.

526
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,114
Are you going to help me or not?

527
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,784
I don't believe this.
All right.

528
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:51,327
Okay.

529
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:52,829
Has this happened before?

530
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,582
The dead dick thing?

531
00:28:55,749 --> 00:28:58,293
Never.
Well, one time. Last night.

532
00:28:59,253 --> 00:29:01,338
- One more time.
- So twice.

533
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:03,340
Do the math. Two times.

534
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:07,386
Then another time, but after
a big meal, so that don't count.

535
00:29:07,637 --> 00:29:10,556
Being unable to perform
three or four times is not...

536
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:11,974
Eight times.

537
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,268
Eight times is not catastrophic.

538
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:16,145
Maybe not to you. Look at you.

539
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,107
But if I can't get it up,
that makes me less of a man.

540
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:22,234
In my world, I deal with animals.

541
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:25,195
They may seem dumb to
an educated guy like you...

542
00:29:25,405 --> 00:29:28,490
...but animals are very cunning
and they sense weakness.

543
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:30,534
I got less than two weeks...

544
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:33,329
...to get strong, or they'll eat me up,
if they don't kill me.

545
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,622
What happens in two weeks?

546
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:36,832
I can't tell you.
You don't want to know.

547
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,169
You can't tell me and I don't
want to know. That's a big help.

548
00:29:40,337 --> 00:29:42,338
You're supposed to tell me.
I do want to know.

549
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,924
That's how this works.
This is impossible.

550
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:48,302
I can't do anything in two weeks,
and even if I could...

551
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:51,764
...what is my goal? To make you
a happy, well-adjusted gangster?

552
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,850
The other day I was watching
a TV commercial...

553
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:56,727
...some kid playing with puppies.

554
00:29:56,937 --> 00:29:58,854
I cried for 45 minutes.

555
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:00,981
Slap a pair of tits on me, I'm a woman.

556
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:03,610
- I can't help you.
- You're turning me down?

557
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:08,031
When I got into family therapy,
this wasn't the family I had in mind.

558
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:12,661
You with your schmucky little office
and house, you're turning me down?

559
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,246
So you can listen to
housewives piss and moan...

560
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:17,582
...about nobody fucks them
right anymore? Eh?

561
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:19,167
- I'm leaving now.
- You see this?

562
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:22,212
This is what I'm talking about.

563
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,047
I'm a dead man.

564
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:29,719
You call yourself a doctor.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

565
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:35,559
A real doctor could never turn his back
on a person who's suffering!

566
00:30:36,395 --> 00:30:40,940
You couldn't treat a fucking
two-celled amoeba, you fucking phony.

567
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:47,822
Mother of God, give me
the strength to get through this.

568
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:51,409
This fucking rat bastard
won't help me.

569
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:56,998
I start crying all the time.
Don't know what it is.

570
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:58,833
All right, here.

571
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:08,093
Sit down.

572
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:14,099
What happened with
your wife last night?

573
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:16,810
I wasn't with my wife.
I was with my girlfriend.

574
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,146
- Are you having marriage problems?
- No.

575
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:20,814
Why do you have a girlfriend?

576
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:22,566
You're moralizing with me now?

577
00:31:22,775 --> 00:31:25,277
No, I'm curious.
Why do you have a girlfriend?

578
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:27,696
I do things with her
I can't do with my wife.

579
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:29,281
Why can't you do them with your wife?

580
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,826
That's the mouth she kisses
my kids with. Are you crazy?

581
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:36,997
Have you been under stress lately?

582
00:31:37,206 --> 00:31:40,250
- Like seeing your best friend murdered?
- That would qualify.

583
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,877
I got a lot of stress.

584
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:49,342
Based upon what you told me before
about the attacks...

585
00:31:49,552 --> 00:31:51,303
...I'd say that was probably it.

586
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,014
- Just stress?
- "Just stress"?

587
00:31:54,223 --> 00:31:56,016
Stress is a very powerful force.

588
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:59,144
I doubt there's anything
physically wrong with you.

589
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:01,229
- That's it?
- That's it.

590
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:04,483
- That's it?
- I think so.

591
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:07,028
- You.
- No, no.

592
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:08,571
You're very good, you.

593
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:10,114
You are very good.

594
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:12,450
- There's more to it than...
- You're very good.

595
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,619
- There are underlying...
- Understand me?

596
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:16,245
You're right on the money.

597
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:18,998
I feel the juices rush back
to my balls as we speak.

598
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,709
I never thought I'd hear
another man say that to me.

599
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,087
That settles it.
You are my shrink.

600
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:25,838
No, I couldn't.

601
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:29,509
You're not ready to open up.
You're not a good candidate...

602
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:32,762
Listen to you.
The fucking honesty.

603
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:34,388
That's it. You don't understand.

604
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,850
Nobody, nobody talks to me like that.

605
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:38,477
You understand?

606
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,187
- Yes, I do.
- That's it.

607
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:41,522
Let's do it. I'm ready.

608
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:43,565
You don't hear the word "no" very often.

609
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:47,027
I hear it all the time,
only it's more, "No, please, no, no. "

610
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:49,363
I'm here for two more days.

611
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:52,825
When I get back to New York,
I'll treat you exclusively.

612
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:54,827
For two weeks.

613
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:57,079
I just don't know what
to tell my patients.

614
00:32:57,288 --> 00:32:59,039
- You want me to clear your schedule?
- Oh, no.

615
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:02,000
It would be my honor to do that.
My pleasure. Jimmy?

616
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:04,670
No. No, not Jimmy.
I will do this myself.

617
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,004
- You sure?
- Positive.

618
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:07,882
I will see you in New York.

619
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,052
Okay. Want one of them?

620
00:33:11,262 --> 00:33:12,387
No, thanks.
Sure?

621
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:14,556
That's very kind of you, but I...

622
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:16,891
Want to give a little sta minch?

623
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,768
You sure?

624
00:33:19,812 --> 00:33:21,104
The pause that refreshes.

625
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:23,064
I don't... No, I really...

626
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:24,357
You're on vacation.

627
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:26,401
I'm also about to get married...

628
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:29,070
...so I'd like to go back
to my hotel and...

629
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,573
Good night.
I'll see you in New York.

630
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:34,742
You. Hey, Doc. You.

631
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,494
I'm going to see a lot of you.

632
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:40,415
Ben? Where were you?

633
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:42,584
My God, I woke up
and you were gone!

634
00:33:42,793 --> 00:33:45,461
There was no note or anything!
I was out of my mind!

635
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:47,922
I walked all over the hotel
looking for you.

636
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:51,217
I even ate a Rice Krispy Treat.
I almost called the police.

637
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:54,304
No, don't call the police.
I'll tell you the truth.

638
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:56,431
I had a patient emergency.

639
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,725
You have patients in Florida?

640
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:02,604
One. He followed me from New York.
I had to go, trust me.

641
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:04,772
My God. Who is this patient?

642
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:10,487
Paul Vitti.

643
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:14,033
- Paul Vitti? Mafia Paul Vitti?
- Yeah.

644
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,118
Yes.

645
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:20,456
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

646
00:34:21,124 --> 00:34:23,626
Listen. It's not like
he's a regular patient.

647
00:34:23,835 --> 00:34:25,794
- He's got problems.
- Well, yeah.

648
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:28,672
He thinks that I'm treating him.
It's crazy.

649
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,466
- So you're not treating him?
- No.

650
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:31,884
Tell me you're not.

651
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:33,302
I'm not treating him.

652
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,513
It's scary. You don't want
someone like that in your life.

653
00:34:36,723 --> 00:34:39,601
I've covered the mob down here.
I've seen what they do.

654
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,938
He and I spoke about it.
He understood. It's over.

655
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,273
- You're sure?
- Absolutely.

656
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,275
Okay.

657
00:34:47,443 --> 00:34:49,152
I was so worried.

658
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:51,488
I thought maybe you got scared or...

659
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,156
...saw an ex-girlfriend
or something.

660
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,659
- Oh, no, no.
- Well, I don't know.

661
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:58,078
- I love you.
- I love you.

662
00:34:58,287 --> 00:35:01,498
I'm sorry, but everything's
going to be okay.

663
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,835
It's such a good vibration

664
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,380
Give her a big hand! Let's hear it!
How about that?

665
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:11,884
Ooh, wow.

666
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:15,721
That was great!
Come on, get into it.

667
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,432
I don't understand.
They splash in the water.

668
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,850
They eat fish.

669
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,686
This is not a big stretch
for a whale.

670
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:22,895
Stop it.

671
00:35:23,063 --> 00:35:25,189
We're having fun, right?

672
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:28,276
I'm not having as much fun
as it looks like I am.

673
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,279
I'm pretending, because we
have to bond and all.

674
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:41,539
As I was saying, a little snack
for her might be, oh, 50 pounds of mackerel.

675
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,208
There she goes!

676
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:50,715
I'm going to get a hot dog.
Anybody want anything?

677
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,425
- I'll go with you.
- No, it's fine.

678
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:55,469
You're pretending to have a good time.
I don't want to spoil that.

679
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:56,929
I'll be right back.

680
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,223
You think those whales
piss in that water?

681
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:03,436
I think they use the men's room
next door to the Burger King.

682
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:04,645
Dummy.

683
00:36:04,855 --> 00:36:07,023
- What's going on?
- Mr. Vitti wants to see you.

684
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,859
- Is this a joke?
- You're an employee of Mr. Vitti's...

685
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,487
...which means you're on call
24 hours a day...

686
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:14,156
...just like the rest of us.

687
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:15,741
I'm sorry. He and I discussed...

688
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:19,077
We discussed this, and I agreed
to see him in New York.

689
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:20,245
That's it.

690
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:23,373
Dr. Momma-Luke, listen to me.
It is what it is.

691
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,043
If he wants you sooner,
you go sooner.

692
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,586
That's it. Yeah.

693
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:29,004
No. I am not going.

694
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:31,757
And if either one of you
bother me again...

695
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:33,425
...I won't treat him at all.

696
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:34,760
Do you understand that?

697
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:38,638
It's over! End of story.

698
00:36:39,474 --> 00:36:41,683
Look at the size of this one.

699
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:44,103
Jesus Christ!

700
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,357
It's feeding time.

701
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:51,444
They threw me in
the shark tank, Paul.

702
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:53,237
They were trying to make a point.

703
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:55,490
That you're scary?
Believe me, I get it.

704
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:56,699
You're in a mood.

705
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:59,452
I get that way when
a shark tries to chew on my ass.

706
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:02,372
- We had an agreement.
- We did, but I had an episode.

707
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:05,583
I didn't have a panic attack,
but I started panicking...

708
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,794
...thinking I might get one.
Is that weird?

709
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:10,755
I am redefining "weird"
on an hourly basis.

710
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:12,715
What's he doing?
I don't know.

711
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,344
- He's talking with some guy.
Can you hit him?

712
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:18,680
He's got fat Jelly and
his partner Jimmy Boots with him.

713
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,934
I could do it with a rifle and scope,
but I don't have that with me.

714
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:23,143
Just get him.

715
00:37:23,353 --> 00:37:25,479
You told me to take care of him,
I'll do it.

716
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:27,815
What were you thinking
when you got anxious?

717
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:30,317
Let's get out of here.
We're being watched.

718
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:33,320
Don't look.
There's feds up there watching us.

719
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:35,280
How do you know that?

720
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:37,116
I'm a criminal. It's my job.

721
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:40,327
Who's the new face?

722
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:43,580
Maybe he's Vitti's new consigliere.

723
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:46,875
Whoever this guy is,
he must be important to the family.

724
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:49,837
Put his picture on the wire,
see what you come up with.

725
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,345
Normally, a patient wouldn't have
a vat of Scotch during a session.

726
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:04,017
That's interesting. I'll have to
remember it if I'm ever on Jeopardy.

727
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:05,561
Tell me about your father.

728
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,397
My father. Well, my father...

729
00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:10,107
Let's sit here.

730
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,151
My father.

731
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:15,947
A big man in the neighborhood.
Everybody loved him.

732
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:18,074
Very well-respected, God rest his soul.

733
00:38:18,284 --> 00:38:19,784
He passed away?

734
00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:22,954
I just like saying "God rest his soul. "
Of course he passed away.

735
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:24,873
I was about 12 at the time.

736
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,374
How did he die?

737
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:29,043
It was a sudden thing.
A heart attack.

738
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:31,629
How was the relationship?
Were you close?

739
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,131
Eh, we were pretty close.

740
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,592
We weren't getting along great
right then.

741
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:37,302
Why is that?

742
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,096
I was hanging out in the neighborhood.
I had a borgata.

743
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:41,556
What is that?

744
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:44,225
A kid gang, nothing big.
But he didn't like that.

745
00:38:44,393 --> 00:38:45,644
- He didn't approve.
- No, no.

746
00:38:45,812 --> 00:38:48,147
He slapped me around
a couple of times.

747
00:38:48,482 --> 00:38:49,648
And what?

748
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:51,150
And then he died.

749
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:53,569
How'd that make you feel?

750
00:38:53,737 --> 00:38:56,280
It felt great, wonderful.
How'd it make me feel?

751
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:57,573
Think about it.

752
00:38:57,741 --> 00:39:00,951
Were you angry?
Were you afraid? Sad?

753
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,120
Maybe all those things.

754
00:39:03,288 --> 00:39:04,914
Any feelings of guilt?

755
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,457
About what? I didn't kill him.

756
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:08,334
I know that,
I'm just speculating...

757
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:12,505
...that maybe in some way
you may have wanted him to die.

758
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:14,173
Why would I want him to die?

759
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:17,302
You said you were fighting.
He slapped you around...

760
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:19,721
...because you rebelled
against his authority.

761
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:21,765
Maybe some unresolved
Oedipal conflict.

762
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:23,600
English, English.

763
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:27,687
Oedipus was a Greek king who killed
his father and married his mother.

764
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:28,980
Fucking Greeks.

765
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:31,483
It's an instinctual developmental drive.

766
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:33,818
The young boy wants to
replace his father...

767
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:36,446
...so that he can
totally possess his mother.

768
00:39:36,614 --> 00:39:38,949
Are you saying
I wanted to fuck my mother?

769
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:42,160
- It's a primal fantasy.
- Have you ever seen my mother?

770
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,621
- Are you out of your mind?
- It's Freud!

771
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:47,666
Freud's a sick fuck, and you are
too for bringing it up.

772
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,793
- It's...
- Ugh!

773
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:54,673
Can I be honest?
I don't think I can call you Dad.

774
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:57,634
So, what do I call you?
Do I call you Scott?

775
00:39:57,802 --> 00:39:59,511
My friends call me Captain.

776
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:01,972
- Captain?
- Yeah, Captain.

777
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:03,640
Captain.

778
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:06,101
Want another drink?
I'm definitely having eight or nine.

779
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,144
I'd like a morphine and soda.

780
00:40:08,312 --> 00:40:10,230
I'm shaking.

781
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:13,984
Shall we go to our table?
Come on, Michael.

782
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:15,569
Hey. Hey.

783
00:40:15,736 --> 00:40:17,028
Seסor Sobel.

784
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:21,659
How you doing?

785
00:40:23,328 --> 00:40:24,829
Honey, it's the Vittis.

786
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:27,039
My God. Yeah.

787
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,460
Everybody's happy,
everybody's smiling. This is nice.

788
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:33,504
You Paul Vitti, the mobster.

789
00:40:35,257 --> 00:40:37,383
Now, is that polite? Eh?

790
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:39,885
Is that being nice?
I'm trying to be nice.

791
00:40:40,095 --> 00:40:43,055
Do I walk up to you and say
you're so-and-so, the hard-on?

792
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,225
This is Laura's father,
the captain.

793
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:48,227
I'm very, very sorry.

794
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:49,563
Excuse us.

795
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:54,109
I heard about the wedding.
Here you go.

796
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,613
A little something for
the bride and groom. God bless.

797
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,114
We can't accept this.

798
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:00,991
- Yes, you can.
- Thank you.

799
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,578
I'm just going to borrow this guy.
I'll bring him right back.

800
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:06,538
And then you'll leave us alone.

801
00:41:06,706 --> 00:41:09,625
I'll leave you alone.
I got to talk to you.

802
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:13,128
Two minutes.
Two minutes.

803
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:15,922
Wait over there.
Don't listen to what we say.

804
00:41:16,132 --> 00:41:17,591
My ears are sealed.

805
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,719
I had a really weird dream
last night.

806
00:41:19,887 --> 00:41:22,889
I feel like I'm having one now.
Why'd you interrupt my party?

807
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:25,642
You're really very rigid
about certain things.

808
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,185
Did you know that?

809
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:29,729
All right,
tell me about your dream.

810
00:41:29,897 --> 00:41:31,522
I'm asleep.

811
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:34,359
I hear a baby crying.
I go to the refrigerator.

812
00:41:34,568 --> 00:41:36,152
I get him a bottle of milk.

813
00:41:36,362 --> 00:41:38,154
I bring the bottle of milk to him...

814
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:39,697
...I see the milk is black.

815
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:42,533
That's fucking weird!
- Get out of here.

816
00:41:42,743 --> 00:41:44,410
- Get out of here.
- Sorry.

817
00:41:45,454 --> 00:41:48,581
What does that mean?
And no more filth about my mother.

818
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:50,708
I don't know.
What does it mean to you?

819
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:54,754
This is why I pay you? I say
something, you say it back to me?

820
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:57,215
I could get Jelly to
do that for nothing.

821
00:41:57,424 --> 00:41:59,967
Get Jelly.
I'm going back to my party.

822
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:04,097
All right.
I'm letting it go this time.

823
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:07,392
Because you're getting married,
I'm going to let it go.

824
00:42:11,105 --> 00:42:14,065
Why don't you look over that way
before I bust your fucking head open?

825
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:15,608
Jesus.

826
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:32,292
I'm going to grab a bite to eat.
You want a sandwich?

827
00:42:32,794 --> 00:42:34,962
What kind of sandwich
ain't too fattening?

828
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,755
A half a sandwich.

829
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:39,216
I'll be back in a few minutes.

830
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,667
Now, nod your head and smile.
Do it.

831
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,336
Now, you listen to me, goombah.

832
00:43:15,504 --> 00:43:18,548
I know what your game is,
and you'd better call it quits.

833
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:22,343
If you and your paisans
do anything to hurt my little girl...

834
00:43:22,554 --> 00:43:24,180
...I don't care who
your friends are...

835
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:27,850
...I'll hunt you down like
the dog you are, and I'll kill you.

836
00:43:28,018 --> 00:43:29,435
Understand?

837
00:43:29,603 --> 00:43:31,395
Now, nod and smile.

838
00:43:31,938 --> 00:43:33,189
Congratulations.

839
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,027
What was that about?

840
00:43:38,236 --> 00:43:41,947
Just guy stuff between
me and the captain.

841
00:44:47,056 --> 00:44:48,515
Shit!

842
00:44:51,352 --> 00:44:53,937
In sickness and in health,
from this day forth...

843
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:56,107
...as long as you both shall live?
- I...

844
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:04,866
Ey-ey-ey-ey-ey.

845
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:07,994
Bring Marie and
the kids right to the airport.

846
00:45:08,203 --> 00:45:11,956
Pull the car in the back of the hotel
and wait for us.

847
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:13,207
You got it, boss.

848
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:16,043
That's it. That is it.
I have had it with you.

849
00:45:16,253 --> 00:45:17,295
- What happened?
- What happened?

850
00:45:17,504 --> 00:45:21,382
I just saw a man fall seven stories
into a platter of poached salmon!

851
00:45:21,592 --> 00:45:23,467
Did he break anything?
- Everything!

852
00:45:23,635 --> 00:45:25,344
They're still pulling capers
out of him.

853
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:29,391
People get depressed, they jump.
It's a tragedy, but it ain't my fault.

854
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,226
You're telling me it was a suicide?

855
00:45:31,436 --> 00:45:33,979
I think he left a note.
Jelly, did they find it?

856
00:45:34,147 --> 00:45:36,106
No, but they will in a minute.

857
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,442
Let me guess what it says:
"Life is bullshit.

858
00:45:38,651 --> 00:45:40,986
I can't fucking take it no more.
Signed, the dead guy. "

859
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:43,113
Hey. That's good, Doc.

860
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,574
Enough talk.
We got to get out of here.

861
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:47,367
There's feds all over.

862
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:49,453
I'm going back to New York...

863
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:52,456
...and I would suggest that
you do the same thing.

864
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:54,458
Because they're probably
on to you too.

865
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:56,710
On to me?
What are you talking about?

866
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,380
Being an accessory to a murder
wasn't part of our understanding.

867
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,299
I didn't kill nobody.

868
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:04,343
I can't speak for
other people in the room.

869
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,677
That guy tried to kill me.

870
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:08,513
God forbid he did that
to somebody in my family.

871
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:11,016
It would've been
a double or a triple tragedy.

872
00:46:11,184 --> 00:46:13,560
Trust me, in this case,
we're the good guys.

873
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,270
Where is he?

874
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:18,315
Where are you going?
- Don't touch me.

875
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,859
How could you do that?

876
00:46:21,152 --> 00:46:22,945
Another country heard from.

877
00:46:23,488 --> 00:46:24,529
Wait downstairs.

878
00:46:24,697 --> 00:46:27,909
Why? Are they going to throw me
off the balcony too?

879
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,037
You're upset and
you're upsetting me.

880
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,330
Of course I'm upset!

881
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,875
My wedding is ruined
because you've got problems!

882
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,126
I got problems?

883
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,753
Honey, please.

884
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,548
I'm going to pack,
and then I'm going to New York.

885
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,718
And I am getting married with you
or without you!

886
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,513
With! With! I'm sorry, honey.

887
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,058
It'll all work out. I promise.
Please?

888
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,644
No, I hate you!

889
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,315
Are you happy?
Are you happy?

890
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,818
You know what you did?
You have ruined my life!

891
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,903
Happy?
What are you talking about?

892
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:05,406
You think I wanted this?
I'm a victim here.

893
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,032
I can't believe this guy.

894
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:09,493
He tries to kill me,
then whacks one of my guys.

895
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:13,247
On top of that, he fucks up your wedding.
You know how upset I am?

896
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:16,166
I'm so enraged, I don't know
what do to with myself!

897
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:18,919
Plus, I'm trying to
get out of this hotel and...

898
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:20,754
Are you listening to yourself?

899
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:22,131
Listen to yourself!

900
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:26,552
This has been a disaster from the moment
you stepped foot in my office.

901
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,431
That is it. Over!
I'm no longer your doctor.

902
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:31,016
Just because of this?

903
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:34,394
Because of this little double homicide?
Yes, because of this!

904
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:38,106
You don't have a shred
of human decency. Not a shred.

905
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:40,275
I actually thought I could help you.

906
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:43,028
There's no helping you.
You're a common thug!

907
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:44,863
Nobody in the world could help you!

908
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:46,614
All right!
What do you want me to do?

909
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:51,995
Yo.

910
00:47:52,163 --> 00:47:54,456
Let me speak to Primo.
- Hold on.

911
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,585
Paul Vitti's on the phone.

912
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:01,796
- Vitti?
- Vitti.

913
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:08,928
- Hello.
- Yeah, yeah, hello.

914
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:10,388
Who is this?
- It's me.

915
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:12,724
- Me who?
- Me who... Me, me.

916
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,602
- Me, me who?
- Me, me. You know me. Me.

917
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,562
Yeah, how's it going?

918
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:18,980
Not good. Not good.

919
00:48:19,148 --> 00:48:22,150
Whoever did that thing to
you-know-who, my good friend...

920
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:23,818
...they're trying to do that to me.

921
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:26,446
And I'm having a lot
of feelings about that.

922
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:29,157
And I'm trying to get some...

923
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:31,494
- Closure.
... closure on that.

924
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:35,122
What kind of feelings?

925
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:38,042
I'm very angry.
I'm feeling very angry about that.

926
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,752
I'm really, uh...

927
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,087
I'm enraged.

928
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,506
I'm feeling very,
very mad about that.

929
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,007
Why are you telling me?

930
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:46,634
Why am I telling you?

931
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:49,011
Like you don't know
nothing about it? Eh?

932
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,513
You don't know nothing?
What?

933
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:52,848
I don't know what
you're talking about.

934
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:54,683
- I'm trying to...
- Tell you how I feel.

935
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:57,394
Tell you about my feelings
and that...

936
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,146
- I'm angry.
- I'm angry.

937
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:00,731
And anger is a...

938
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,692
- A blocked wish.
- A blocked wish.

939
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:06,196
And I'm looking forward to seeing
you next week at that thing...

940
00:49:06,364 --> 00:49:08,990
...then I can unblock
that angered wish...

941
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:10,200
...and then hopefully...

942
00:49:10,368 --> 00:49:12,869
You make one more move on me,
you motherfucker...

943
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:15,038
...I'll fucking cut
your fucking balls off!

944
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:18,625
I'll shove them up your fucking ass,
I'll fucking bury you!

945
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:21,878
I'll put ice picks in your eyes!
I'll chop your eyeballs!

946
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:24,881
I'll send them to your family
to eat for dessert!

947
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:27,050
- You understand me?
- Hey, Paul.

948
00:49:27,218 --> 00:49:28,552
- What?
- Fuck you.

949
00:49:28,761 --> 00:49:30,554
You motherfucker!

950
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:36,394
You get a dictionary and find out
what this "closure" is.

951
00:49:36,562 --> 00:49:40,731
If that's what he's going to hit us
with, I want to know what it is.

952
00:49:40,941 --> 00:49:42,358
How was that?

953
00:49:42,943 --> 00:49:44,652
It was going great until...

954
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:47,613
...the cutting off of the balls
and shoving it up...

955
00:49:47,823 --> 00:49:49,073
...his ass.

956
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:52,577
You know what I do when I'm mad?
I hit a pillow.

957
00:49:52,744 --> 00:49:54,495
Just hit the pillow.
See how you feel.

958
00:49:59,459 --> 00:50:01,294
There's your fucking pillow.

959
00:50:02,421 --> 00:50:04,088
Feel better?

960
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:06,674
Yeah, I do.

961
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:08,176
Good.

962
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,610
Call the Vatican.
See if something is missing.

963
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:27,987
So cool!

964
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:32,074
Michael, I need to talk to your dad
in private, okay?

965
00:50:32,284 --> 00:50:34,077
Would you unload the car, please?

966
00:50:34,287 --> 00:50:37,080
It's almost as tall as the house.

967
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,125
- Mike?
- All right.

968
00:50:40,293 --> 00:50:41,960
What is going on?

969
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,795
What is this?

970
00:50:44,672 --> 00:50:46,089
Why?

971
00:50:46,466 --> 00:50:49,301
It's a wedding gift.
He felt bad for the...

972
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:53,513
Mm-hm, okay. Well, we're not married,
so we can just send it back.

973
00:50:56,142 --> 00:50:58,310
It was not my fault.
Everybody was there.

974
00:50:58,478 --> 00:51:01,271
You didn't want to
go ahead with the ceremony.

975
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:05,443
What did you expect? That's not what
I want for an anniversary memory.

976
00:51:05,653 --> 00:51:09,030
"Look at our wedding video.
There are your parents, and mine.

977
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,491
There's the guy that plunged to his death. "

978
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,910
I just want to marry you.

979
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:16,329
I'm thinking it'll never happen.

980
00:51:16,538 --> 00:51:19,415
It's happening next Saturday
at the Waldorf.

981
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:20,833
And who will be there?

982
00:51:21,043 --> 00:51:22,418
The three of us, the clergyman...

983
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:26,130
...and any of your family who
are done with their crisis counseling.

984
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,883
No guests without necks.
Everybody has to have a neck.

985
00:51:29,093 --> 00:51:32,345
- We will do a neck check at the door.
- Thank you.

986
00:51:33,847 --> 00:51:35,975
Any furniture you want
to change in the house...

987
00:51:37,602 --> 00:51:38,769
Dr. Sobel.

988
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:40,020
Ma'am.

989
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:42,940
I'm Agent Steadman.
Agent Ricci, Agent Provano...

990
00:51:43,149 --> 00:51:45,067
...Federal Bureau
of Investigation, OCD.

991
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:47,152
Obsessive-compulsive disorder?

992
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:50,322
Organized Crime Division.
We need to talk.

993
00:51:50,532 --> 00:51:52,866
FBI? This is cooler
than the fountain.

994
00:51:53,034 --> 00:51:54,159
Go to your room.

995
00:51:54,369 --> 00:51:56,203
- But I just...
- Go to your room.

996
00:51:56,538 --> 00:51:59,039
Fine. I can hear
better in there anyway.

997
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:01,375
Please.

998
00:52:05,547 --> 00:52:07,881
Can you explain these photographs?

999
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:19,226
Yes. I'm a psychotherapist.
Paul Vitti is my patient.

1000
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,103
- Was your patient.
- Was my patient.

1001
00:52:21,313 --> 00:52:23,230
But not even like a patient.

1002
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,565
Right. Exactly.

1003
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:26,859
So why did he send you
that fountain?

1004
00:52:28,153 --> 00:52:29,570
The fountain?

1005
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,489
Oh, that. That was a...

1006
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:36,703
That was a gift to
celebrate the completion...

1007
00:52:36,871 --> 00:52:38,246
...of the therapy.

1008
00:52:38,414 --> 00:52:40,623
I got a television
from a kleptomaniac...

1009
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,251
...so it's not really
that big of a deal.

1010
00:52:43,419 --> 00:52:45,712
Let me cut to the chase,
Dr. Sobel.

1011
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:50,425
Sometime in the next week,
the heads of every major crime family...

1012
00:52:50,593 --> 00:52:52,969
...are meeting somewhere
in the New York area.

1013
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:55,930
We think the stage is set
for a major bloodbath.

1014
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,515
Has he mentioned it to you?

1015
00:52:57,683 --> 00:52:59,768
A bloodbath?

1016
00:52:59,935 --> 00:53:03,271
No. He has not mentioned
anything like that.

1017
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:05,607
I would've remembered that.

1018
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:08,944
"Bloodbath" is something that
sticks out in a conversation.

1019
00:53:09,112 --> 00:53:13,032
You could really help us by supplying
information about that meeting.

1020
00:53:14,117 --> 00:53:15,868
If I don't?

1021
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:17,870
If you don't...

1022
00:53:18,038 --> 00:53:20,915
...I will personally
make your life a living hell.

1023
00:53:24,753 --> 00:53:27,922
Pauly, I don't mean this
in a disrespectful way.

1024
00:53:28,757 --> 00:53:31,509
Now, you know I was
a good friend to your father.

1025
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,720
I'll always be
a good friend to you.

1026
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:38,433
But the word is out
that you're talking to a shrink.

1027
00:53:38,643 --> 00:53:40,894
- Is that right?
- What's the point here?

1028
00:53:41,062 --> 00:53:44,731
The point is this concerns
the whole family.

1029
00:53:44,899 --> 00:53:47,984
Right now, we're the only ones
that know about it.

1030
00:53:48,194 --> 00:53:51,071
If this ever gets out in the street,
we're dead.

1031
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,156
Who knows what
you're saying to him?

1032
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:55,909
It ain't nobody's fucking business.

1033
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:57,369
I beg to differ.

1034
00:53:57,578 --> 00:54:01,498
If you're looking to establish
an insanity plea for later on...

1035
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:03,166
...that's okay.

1036
00:54:03,334 --> 00:54:06,711
But everybody'll think you're
falling apart. It's not right.

1037
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:09,172
They'll think
this is a sign of weakness.

1038
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,509
Sindone will take over everything.
Is that what you want?

1039
00:54:12,677 --> 00:54:14,803
So, what do you want me to do?

1040
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:16,471
It's time to end it, Paul.

1041
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:18,014
What do you mean, end it?

1042
00:54:18,182 --> 00:54:20,517
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much.

1043
00:54:20,685 --> 00:54:23,061
You want me to whack my doctor?
Are you crazy?

1044
00:54:24,021 --> 00:54:27,190
Paul, if you don't do it,
somebody else will.

1045
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:29,234
That's the way it is.

1046
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:31,069
Nobody touches this guy.

1047
00:54:31,237 --> 00:54:34,531
Anybody lays a finger on him,
I'll kill them. Understood?

1048
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:42,373
- I'm getting fruit. Want anything?
- No, I'll wait in the car.

1049
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:51,132
Can I get two of these?

1050
00:55:25,752 --> 00:55:26,919
Papa!

1051
00:55:30,423 --> 00:55:32,299
Papa! Papa!

1052
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:42,894
Papa!

1053
00:55:48,192 --> 00:55:49,609
I'm sorry.

1054
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:51,361
Sorry.

1055
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:01,955
You look lousy.
You all right?

1056
00:56:02,122 --> 00:56:06,209
Yeah, I'm all right.
Listen, Paul, don't send me any more gifts.

1057
00:56:06,418 --> 00:56:10,797
- You didn't like the fountain?
- It's a boundary issue.

1058
00:56:11,006 --> 00:56:13,883
If more people gave from the heart,
we'd all be better off.

1059
00:56:14,093 --> 00:56:17,470
Let me see your watch.
Piece ofjunk. You're getting a Rolex.

1060
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,348
- Don't buy me one.
- Who said anything about buying?

1061
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:22,892
Paul, listen.
I really have to talk to you.

1062
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:34,153
Who is that?

1063
00:56:35,114 --> 00:56:39,242
Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
Worked for a crew out of Jersey City.

1064
00:56:39,827 --> 00:56:42,829
- How did he die?
All rise.

1065
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:46,500
He was on his way to talk
to a federal prosecutor.

1066
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,586
Got hit by a truck.

1067
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,462
Twice.

1068
00:56:51,172 --> 00:56:52,381
I don't need to know this.

1069
00:56:52,591 --> 00:56:53,841
I can't hear this.

1070
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:58,012
This is too much for me.
I'm having nightmares myself.

1071
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:01,307
The other night, I dreamed you and I
were walking down the street...

1072
00:57:01,516 --> 00:57:03,017
...and I stopped to buy some fruit.

1073
00:57:03,184 --> 00:57:05,769
Out of nowhere, two guys
come and they kill me...

1074
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:09,189
...like Marlon Brando
in The Godfather.

1075
00:57:10,275 --> 00:57:12,693
Good scene. What'd I do?

1076
00:57:12,861 --> 00:57:14,029
You drop your gun.

1077
00:57:14,238 --> 00:57:17,741
You run up to me and you
yell, "Papa! Papa!"

1078
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:19,534
I was Fredo?

1079
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,578
I don't think so.

1080
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:25,915
You're starting to lose it.
You may need therapy yourself.

1081
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:29,711
- Paul, we really have to talk. This is...
All rise.

1082
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,714
We're running out of time.

1083
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:52,485
The widow.

1084
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:54,320
I'm very sorry.

1085
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:56,739
The daughter.

1086
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:58,157
I'm sorry.

1087
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:04,121
- Brother.
- My condolences.

1088
00:58:10,128 --> 00:58:11,587
I'm very sorry.

1089
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:31,023
Him I don't know.

1090
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,988
Can we talk now?

1091
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:46,289
Don't you see? You
called me Papa. This is all about your father.

1092
00:58:46,457 --> 00:58:48,333
You're nuts. That's your dream.

1093
00:58:48,501 --> 00:58:50,669
But the black-milk dream
is also about your father.

1094
00:58:50,878 --> 00:58:53,880
I don't buy that. In my dream,
I'm bringing the baby the black milk.

1095
00:58:54,132 --> 00:58:56,508
Freud believed you're everyone
in your dreams.

1096
00:58:56,718 --> 00:58:58,635
Fuck Freud.
After what you told me...

1097
00:58:58,845 --> 00:59:01,388
...I'm afraid to call
my mother on the telephone.

1098
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,807
Listen, just try to go with me here.

1099
00:59:04,016 --> 00:59:06,143
Let's just say that you are the baby.

1100
00:59:06,394 --> 00:59:08,145
What kind of milk did
your father bring you?

1101
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:09,813
Could we stop talking about
my father?

1102
00:59:09,981 --> 00:59:13,692
No. That's the point.
We have to talk about your father.

1103
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:16,194
It is so hard to...
You know what you're like?

1104
00:59:16,404 --> 00:59:18,364
Like this:
"Doc, you got to help me.

1105
00:59:18,574 --> 00:59:20,158
I'm in pain.
Please help me. "

1106
00:59:20,325 --> 00:59:23,161
"All right, Paul, I'll help. "
"Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul Vitti. "

1107
00:59:23,328 --> 00:59:25,413
All right, very good. This is you:

1108
00:59:25,622 --> 00:59:27,915
"Oh. That's interesting.
What does that mean to you?

1109
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:29,834
Anger is a blocked wish. "

1110
00:59:30,085 --> 00:59:32,086
Boo-fucking-hoo-hoo.

1111
00:59:32,296 --> 00:59:34,380
- Let's talk about your father.
- Let's not.

1112
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:35,840
What does your father do?

1113
00:59:36,008 --> 00:59:37,133
It's not important.

1114
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:39,427
- What? You paused.
- I did not.

1115
00:59:39,636 --> 00:59:42,680
You just paused. That means you
had a feeling. A thought.

1116
00:59:42,848 --> 00:59:44,849
What does your father do?
What's he do?

1117
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:47,435
- He's a psychiatrist.
- A psychiatrist?

1118
00:59:47,687 --> 00:59:49,354
Oh.

1119
00:59:49,522 --> 00:59:52,191
Now I know why you're fucked up.
Next patient, please.

1120
00:59:52,525 --> 00:59:53,859
We are running out of time.

1121
00:59:54,027 --> 00:59:56,028
Let's not waste it on my problems.

1122
00:59:56,196 --> 00:59:57,362
- Your father's a problem?
- No.

1123
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,530
- That's what you said.
- I did not!

1124
00:59:58,782 --> 01:00:00,949
- Now you're upset.
- I am not upset!

1125
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:02,284
- Yes, you are.
- Stop it!

1126
01:00:02,494 --> 01:00:03,744
I'm getting good at this.

1127
01:00:03,912 --> 01:00:08,040
Paul, we only have a few days left.
This is very important stuff.

1128
01:00:08,249 --> 01:00:10,292
That's why you're acting like this.

1129
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,544
If you want to spend it
screwing around, I can't help you.

1130
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:14,963
Call me when you want
to get serious.

1131
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:16,757
I am serious.

1132
01:00:16,925 --> 01:00:19,218
Hey. Don't you want to
analyze me no more?

1133
01:00:19,385 --> 01:00:21,637
Doc, doc, doc.

1134
01:00:21,805 --> 01:00:23,055
Say hello to your father for me.

1135
01:00:28,978 --> 01:00:31,063
It's time to end it, Paul.

1136
01:00:31,231 --> 01:00:32,731
What do you mean, end it?

1137
01:00:32,899 --> 01:00:35,400
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already.

1138
01:00:35,568 --> 01:00:37,110
You want me to whack my doctor?

1139
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,156
If you don't do it,
somebody else will. That's the way it is.

1140
01:00:41,324 --> 01:00:42,616
Nobody touches this guy.

1141
01:00:42,826 --> 01:00:45,410
Anybody lays a finger on him,
I'm gonna kill them.

1142
01:00:45,578 --> 01:00:47,246
Understood?

1143
01:00:48,248 --> 01:00:49,833
Now let's hear the other one.

1144
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:52,418
You want me to whack my doctor?

1145
01:00:52,586 --> 01:00:55,755
If you don't do it,
somebody else will. That's the way it is.

1146
01:00:55,923 --> 01:00:57,799
I'm gonna kill them.

1147
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,511
- Good.
- That's very good.

1148
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,389
We think it's time to end it.

1149
01:01:04,598 --> 01:01:05,640
What do you mean?

1150
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:08,726
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already.

1151
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:10,436
You want me to whack my doctor?

1152
01:01:10,604 --> 01:01:13,940
If you don't do it,
somebody else will. That's the way it is.

1153
01:01:14,108 --> 01:01:15,650
I'm gonna kill them.

1154
01:01:20,198 --> 01:01:21,740
What do you want me to do?

1155
01:01:24,953 --> 01:01:27,162
Paul, he's talking to the feds.

1156
01:01:27,372 --> 01:01:30,124
I know this guy. He wouldn't
talk to the feds. No way.

1157
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:34,128
The FBI was over at his house today.
Jimmy Boots saw them.

1158
01:01:34,588 --> 01:01:36,964
You saw them there?
- It's the truth. I saw them.

1159
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:38,716
Next, you'll get a call...

1160
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:40,885
...and he'll want a meeting.

1161
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:42,636
Hey, Paul.

1162
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:44,597
Dr. Sobel called.

1163
01:01:44,806 --> 01:01:47,266
He said he needs to see you
right away.

1164
01:01:50,061 --> 01:01:53,565
If our lips should meet

1165
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:57,068
Innamorata

1166
01:01:57,236 --> 01:01:58,737
This is delicious.

1167
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:00,405
This is so good.

1168
01:02:00,823 --> 01:02:02,324
I love Italian food.

1169
01:02:02,575 --> 01:02:04,951
I've never been to Italy. Is it great?

1170
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,745
I was in France twice...

1171
01:02:06,913 --> 01:02:09,873
...and Jamaica, the island.
You ever been there?

1172
01:02:10,082 --> 01:02:12,042
It's great,
because I love to snorkel.

1173
01:02:12,209 --> 01:02:15,337
Have you guys ever snorkeled?
It's great to sleep with the fish.

1174
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:17,589
Swim with the fish.
Have you ever done that?

1175
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,758
It's good. So...

1176
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,344
...what are you doing this summer?

1177
01:02:22,511 --> 01:02:24,220
About what?

1178
01:02:25,181 --> 01:02:27,432
- Hey, Carlo.
- How are you?

1179
01:02:28,976 --> 01:02:31,186
- Jelly. Good.
- How you doing?

1180
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,189
This is Ben. Say hello to Carlo.

1181
01:02:34,357 --> 01:02:36,232
- Carlo. Carlo...?
- How you doing?

1182
01:02:36,442 --> 01:02:38,652
That's it. Grab a seat.

1183
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:43,698
Carlo and I grew up together.

1184
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,909
He's like, I would say, almost...

1185
01:02:46,118 --> 01:02:48,036
...like a cousin to me.

1186
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:50,580
- I am your cousin.
- That's what I'm saying.

1187
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,875
It's a family thing.
It's the closeness.

1188
01:02:53,043 --> 01:02:56,087
Anything he needs, anything I can
do for him, I'm here for him.

1189
01:02:56,296 --> 01:02:57,630
- You know that.
- I know.

1190
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,632
Did you take care of that thing?

1191
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,594
- It's all right to talk business?
- It's okay.

1192
01:03:03,762 --> 01:03:05,304
- I took care of it.
- And the other?

1193
01:03:05,514 --> 01:03:08,641
I got to wait for the first
before I can move on the second.

1194
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,476
The guy give you a problem?

1195
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:13,562
The guy in the first thing?
He's a lunatic.

1196
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:15,398
- What did he say?
- The usual.

1197
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:17,149
You told him you weren't doing it?

1198
01:03:17,317 --> 01:03:18,484
What am I going to do?

1199
01:03:18,652 --> 01:03:20,486
Got to nip that shit in the bud.

1200
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,281
But if the first comes through,
that'll fix everything.

1201
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:26,368
Including the second thing.
Exactly.

1202
01:03:27,495 --> 01:03:29,746
Don't repeat what you hear here.
You hear?

1203
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:32,165
The first thing
or the second thing?

1204
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,417
Very funny.

1205
01:03:33,584 --> 01:03:35,502
Stevie Beef is over there.

1206
01:03:37,005 --> 01:03:39,089
- Fat piece of shit.
- Rat-fucking, cocksucking...

1207
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,842
- Scumbag.
- Garbage pail.

1208
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,260
Let's go say hi.

1209
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:47,806
Hey, Steve, how are you?

1210
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:52,811
So this is a very unusual place.
Do you guys come here often?

1211
01:03:52,979 --> 01:03:56,774
Well, this place has
a very special meaning for Paul.

1212
01:03:56,942 --> 01:03:58,735
Yeah, it's where his father
got whacked.

1213
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:00,445
Hey.

1214
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:03,531
What's the big secret?
Never mind.

1215
01:04:03,741 --> 01:04:05,241
Wait a second.

1216
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:08,786
Paul's father was murdered?

1217
01:04:08,954 --> 01:04:11,456
Right at that table,
with his whole family there.

1218
01:04:11,623 --> 01:04:13,624
Shut your face.

1219
01:04:17,046 --> 01:04:19,756
Paul was there too.

1220
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:22,383
He doesn't like to talk about it.

1221
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:30,725
Where you going?

1222
01:04:30,934 --> 01:04:32,143
To the bathroom.

1223
01:04:32,311 --> 01:04:33,936
Sit down.

1224
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:35,646
I'm going with you.

1225
01:04:42,821 --> 01:04:45,281
Jelly, I have to, you know...

1226
01:04:45,616 --> 01:04:47,867
- Poop?
- Yeah.

1227
01:04:48,744 --> 01:04:49,827
Go ahead.

1228
01:05:11,768 --> 01:05:14,186
Holy shit!

1229
01:05:17,482 --> 01:05:20,359
You got to get more roughage, Doc.

1230
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:21,610
Wow!

1231
01:05:21,778 --> 01:05:23,570
A bran muffin in the morning
would help that.

1232
01:05:26,241 --> 01:05:27,450
I don't believe this.

1233
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,036
I'd like to see a movie,
but there's nothing out there.

1234
01:05:30,204 --> 01:05:33,414
It's all this shoot-them-up
action bullshit.

1235
01:05:33,624 --> 01:05:36,167
I get enough of that at work.

1236
01:05:36,752 --> 01:05:39,462
Primo, that was our friend.

1237
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:41,714
They spotted that guy
at Paretti's Restaurant.

1238
01:05:41,882 --> 01:05:43,508
That's good.

1239
01:05:43,676 --> 01:05:45,176
That's very good.

1240
01:05:45,386 --> 01:05:47,470
Handsome Jack.

1241
01:05:47,888 --> 01:05:49,806
Let's make it his last supper.

1242
01:05:49,974 --> 01:05:52,183
- You got it, Primo.
- No problem.

1243
01:05:52,351 --> 01:05:55,645
Hey, Jack. Just for fun...

1244
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:57,898
...tear out his heart and bring it to me.

1245
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:01,152
I'm going to bring it back to you
on a fucking platter.

1246
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:02,903
Where we going to get a platter?

1247
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:04,655
Just bring it, all right?

1248
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,658
Or Raisin Bran. That goes
right through me.

1249
01:06:07,909 --> 01:06:09,743
- It's a pusher.
- Good tip.

1250
01:06:09,995 --> 01:06:12,872
I have to talk to you.
In private.

1251
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:19,920
Why didn't you tell me
about your father?

1252
01:06:20,088 --> 01:06:21,088
What about him?

1253
01:06:21,256 --> 01:06:23,257
You told me he died
of a heart attack.

1254
01:06:23,425 --> 01:06:26,677
- What's the problem?
- Your father was murdered.

1255
01:06:26,845 --> 01:06:29,513
What's the difference? He's dead.

1256
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:32,641
It's a big difference.
Why didn't you tell me?

1257
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:35,519
It's private. I got to tell you
every little thing?

1258
01:06:35,687 --> 01:06:37,146
This is not a little thing.

1259
01:06:37,355 --> 01:06:39,648
What am I going to do?
Spend my life crying about the past?

1260
01:06:39,816 --> 01:06:41,108
It's over. Forget it.

1261
01:06:41,276 --> 01:06:43,277
I think you want to talk about it.

1262
01:06:43,528 --> 01:06:45,404
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You do.

1263
01:06:45,614 --> 01:06:47,364
I don't want to talk about it.

1264
01:06:47,532 --> 01:06:49,950
- Why did you choose this restaurant?
- I like it.

1265
01:06:50,118 --> 01:06:52,119
Of all the places we could've gone,
why this place?

1266
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,412
White clam sauce. The best.

1267
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:57,291
That's not the reason.
You want me to know about your father.

1268
01:06:57,459 --> 01:07:00,295
- You're reaching out to me.
- Yeah, I'm reaching out to you.

1269
01:07:00,463 --> 01:07:02,672
Where is it?

1270
01:07:11,641 --> 01:07:13,808
Get in the car.

1271
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:18,647
It's late. I'll take a cab.
I can get to Grand Central and...

1272
01:07:18,814 --> 01:07:20,732
You know what?
I can make the 11:10.

1273
01:07:20,942 --> 01:07:22,317
So thanks, anyway.

1274
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:24,653
I said get in the car, Doc.

1275
01:07:25,947 --> 01:07:28,031
Do what he says.

1276
01:07:28,658 --> 01:07:32,745
You know, this is called a "transference
neurosis," where the patient...

1277
01:07:34,998 --> 01:07:36,165
Okay.

1278
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,750
Get in the car.
- Yeah.

1279
01:08:02,986 --> 01:08:06,029
What is this guy doing? He's been
in the bathroom for half an hour.

1280
01:08:07,448 --> 01:08:09,449
- Oh, fuck!
- Get over there!

1281
01:08:17,834 --> 01:08:19,710
Son of a bitch!

1282
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:22,963
We lost him.

1283
01:08:51,868 --> 01:08:53,327
Come on, get out.

1284
01:08:53,536 --> 01:08:55,078
Get out and get over there.

1285
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,460
All right, leave us alone.

1286
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,213
Sorry, Doc.

1287
01:09:04,381 --> 01:09:05,757
It's not personal.

1288
01:09:05,924 --> 01:09:09,635
Don't kid yourself.
It doesn't get more personal than this.

1289
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:15,141
Walk over there.

1290
01:09:20,397 --> 01:09:22,690
- You know why I got to do this?
- Yes. Do you?

1291
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,735
Don't bullshit me.
You ratted me out, you betrayed me.

1292
01:09:25,944 --> 01:09:28,863
I betrayed you? That's interesting.
Who's got the gun?

1293
01:09:29,073 --> 01:09:31,699
Don't give me that.
Are you insulting my intelligence?

1294
01:09:31,909 --> 01:09:33,452
You cooperated with the feds.

1295
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:36,872
They played me a tape. I heard you
say you were going to kill me.

1296
01:09:37,082 --> 01:09:39,541
- I heard the tape.
- Never. On my mother's life.

1297
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:40,793
- Never.
- I heard it.

1298
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,545
It's not important now,
but I did not betray you.

1299
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:46,423
I had a wire on, but I took it off
because I think I can help you.

1300
01:09:46,633 --> 01:09:49,802
- I don't want to know what you think.
- Yes, you do.

1301
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:51,387
Let me help you!

1302
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,305
It's over!

1303
01:09:56,976 --> 01:09:58,852
Can I ask you one last question?

1304
01:10:00,647 --> 01:10:01,730
What?

1305
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:03,315
- What did you order?
- What?

1306
01:10:03,484 --> 01:10:05,151
- What did you order?
- When?

1307
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:08,029
The night your father was killed,
what were you eating?

1308
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,407
How the fuck do I know?

1309
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:11,783
You don't remember?

1310
01:10:11,951 --> 01:10:13,284
It was 35 years ago.

1311
01:10:13,452 --> 01:10:14,828
What was your father eating?

1312
01:10:14,995 --> 01:10:17,330
I don't remember.
What are you talking about?

1313
01:10:17,498 --> 01:10:18,998
Try.

1314
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:22,752
It's a simple question.
What was your father eating?

1315
01:10:32,763 --> 01:10:34,347
Penne.

1316
01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:36,266
Good.

1317
01:10:36,434 --> 01:10:38,476
What did you have?

1318
01:10:42,356 --> 01:10:44,149
Ravioli.

1319
01:10:45,025 --> 01:10:47,569
The food was already on the table?

1320
01:10:47,736 --> 01:10:49,988
No, they were serving it.

1321
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:53,158
And did you see the guys coming?

1322
01:10:54,827 --> 01:10:56,369
One of them.

1323
01:10:57,746 --> 01:10:59,539
Dressed like a busboy.

1324
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,584
Your father saw him too?

1325
01:11:03,377 --> 01:11:06,505
No. I knew the guy looked wrong.

1326
01:11:06,673 --> 01:11:08,048
Why, Paul?

1327
01:11:08,216 --> 01:11:11,343
The pants.
Looked too good for a busboy.

1328
01:11:12,554 --> 01:11:14,513
So he walked to the table.

1329
01:11:14,723 --> 01:11:16,640
I watched him the whole way.

1330
01:11:16,892 --> 01:11:18,517
Did you say anything?

1331
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:22,980
No.

1332
01:11:23,899 --> 01:11:27,109
Dad was so mad at me,
I couldn't say anything.

1333
01:11:27,277 --> 01:11:29,320
And you were mad at him.

1334
01:11:30,906 --> 01:11:32,364
And then what happened?

1335
01:11:32,532 --> 01:11:35,869
I never saw the second guy.
My mother just started screaming.

1336
01:11:36,454 --> 01:11:38,538
And you blame yourself.

1337
01:11:38,706 --> 01:11:41,166
I could've saved him.

1338
01:11:41,334 --> 01:11:42,751
But you were mad at him.

1339
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,753
I should've said something.

1340
01:11:44,962 --> 01:11:47,005
You couldn't have saved him, Paul.

1341
01:11:47,173 --> 01:11:49,341
I killed him.

1342
01:11:49,926 --> 01:11:51,426
You didn't kill him.

1343
01:11:51,636 --> 01:11:54,638
You were mad, but you didn't kill him.
It's the life he chose.

1344
01:11:54,805 --> 01:11:57,516
I just let him die.

1345
01:11:58,392 --> 01:12:00,894
I let him die!

1346
01:12:03,773 --> 01:12:09,403
I let him die, and I couldn't
say goodbye to him.

1347
01:12:10,948 --> 01:12:12,782
So why don't you say it now?

1348
01:12:12,991 --> 01:12:15,243
Tell him. If he was here,
what would you say?

1349
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:16,786
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1350
01:12:16,954 --> 01:12:19,205
I can't. No, I can't.

1351
01:12:19,373 --> 01:12:20,623
Tell him, Paul.

1352
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:23,584
I want to say I'm...

1353
01:12:23,794 --> 01:12:26,295
Dad, I'm sorry.

1354
01:12:28,507 --> 01:12:29,882
I'm sorry.

1355
01:12:31,301 --> 01:12:34,262
I'm sorry, Dad.

1356
01:12:34,429 --> 01:12:36,973
I'm sorry. I let him die.

1357
01:12:38,308 --> 01:12:40,810
I'm sorry, Dad.

1358
01:12:43,438 --> 01:12:45,022
Jesus.

1359
01:12:45,607 --> 01:12:47,650
Poor guy's falling apart.

1360
01:12:47,901 --> 01:12:49,485
Why don't he just pop him?

1361
01:12:49,653 --> 01:12:52,655
It's embarrassing
standing here like this.

1362
01:12:52,823 --> 01:12:53,990
Shut up.

1363
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,416
You couldn't save him.

1364
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,167
I know I could've. I could've.

1365
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:07,420
No, he was trying to save you.

1366
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:09,381
That's what you fought about.

1367
01:13:09,632 --> 01:13:13,218
He didn't want this for you.
And you don't want it for Anthony.

1368
01:13:13,469 --> 01:13:14,636
No, I don't!

1369
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:18,015
You don't want him to grow up
like you did, without a father.

1370
01:13:24,314 --> 01:13:26,273
Your father's not dead, Paul.

1371
01:13:26,482 --> 01:13:30,027
He's alive in you.
And he's trying to tell you something.

1372
01:13:30,236 --> 01:13:31,528
He's trying to tell you...

1373
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:33,280
Holy shit!

1374
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,784
They're shooting! They're shooting!

1375
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,918
- Pull yourself together!
- I feel so bad!

1376
01:13:46,211 --> 01:13:48,671
You're going to feel a lot worse.

1377
01:13:50,549 --> 01:13:52,133
Paul, come on!

1378
01:13:52,885 --> 01:13:55,637
Time to channel all this nice grief...

1379
01:13:55,804 --> 01:13:57,138
...into a murderous rage.

1380
01:13:59,224 --> 01:14:00,767
Come on! Time to shoot back!

1381
01:14:01,018 --> 01:14:03,227
Let's go! Here we go!
Bang, bang!

1382
01:14:04,605 --> 01:14:06,856
Bang, bang! Come on. Let's go.

1383
01:14:07,066 --> 01:14:09,275
Come on! Bang, bang!

1384
01:14:09,735 --> 01:14:11,320
Now come on. Paul, here.

1385
01:14:11,529 --> 01:14:13,989
Put the gun in your hand and shoot!

1386
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,742
For God sakes, shoot somebody!

1387
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,871
Give me the fucking gun!

1388
01:14:39,182 --> 01:14:40,599
Stay down.

1389
01:14:42,185 --> 01:14:43,686
Paul, you okay?

1390
01:14:43,853 --> 01:14:45,187
Yeah, I'm okay.

1391
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:48,065
Jelly. Jelly, did I do that?

1392
01:14:48,608 --> 01:14:49,942
No, Doc.

1393
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,318
That one's mine.

1394
01:14:51,486 --> 01:14:53,278
You get the '72 Chevy...

1395
01:14:53,446 --> 01:14:57,116
...and the Amana side-by-side
refrigerator-freezer.

1396
01:14:57,283 --> 01:14:58,534
You okay, Paul?

1397
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,119
Yeah, I'm okay.

1398
01:15:00,286 --> 01:15:02,121
I'm going to check on Jimmy.

1399
01:15:03,289 --> 01:15:04,581
Jimmy?

1400
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:11,631
Pretty fucking ironic, ain't it?

1401
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,926
You can give me back the gun now.

1402
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,680
It's okay. I wasn't really
going to whack you.

1403
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:22,308
All right, maybe I was
going to whack you.

1404
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:25,228
But I was real conflicted about it.

1405
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,230
Progress, right?

1406
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,196
I can't see you anymore.

1407
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,948
I know.

1408
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,286
You hit some very big stuff tonight.

1409
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:44,331
So you'll probably
feel like this for a while.

1410
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,375
But you're close to something.

1411
01:15:47,294 --> 01:15:48,753
The rest is up to you.

1412
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:51,422
Good luck.

1413
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:01,849
I want to please him
when we're in bed...

1414
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:05,561
...but whatever I do, it seems
like it's never enough.

1415
01:16:05,896 --> 01:16:09,190
Now he wants me to
say things when we're making love.

1416
01:16:13,154 --> 01:16:15,781
What kind of things
does he want you to say?

1417
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:20,702
Well, he wants me to call him "big boy"...

1418
01:16:21,746 --> 01:16:24,247
...and he's my "bucking bronco"...

1419
01:16:25,082 --> 01:16:27,209
...and I'm supposed
to "ride him hard"...

1420
01:16:27,418 --> 01:16:30,921
...and "put him back
in the barn wet. "

1421
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:42,766
Are you okay, Dr. Sobel?

1422
01:16:44,227 --> 01:16:45,685
Well, it's...

1423
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:51,525
Here's what I think
you should do, Elaine.

1424
01:16:51,692 --> 01:16:54,528
I would do whatever he says.

1425
01:16:54,695 --> 01:16:57,155
If he wants you to talk, talk.

1426
01:16:57,365 --> 01:16:59,115
I'd get on all fours
and bark like a dog.

1427
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:00,659
I'd do whatever it takes.

1428
01:17:00,868 --> 01:17:03,203
Smoke some joints,
drink wine, whatever it is...

1429
01:17:03,412 --> 01:17:05,580
...to get off on each other
and be happy.

1430
01:17:05,748 --> 01:17:06,998
Where are you running?

1431
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:09,042
This is a time to be happy!

1432
01:17:09,252 --> 01:17:11,753
Because life is just too short.

1433
01:17:11,963 --> 01:17:15,299
It's just too fucking short.

1434
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,885
Okay.

1435
01:17:24,142 --> 01:17:25,726
I'll see you Thursday.

1436
01:17:30,899 --> 01:17:32,483
Everything okay?

1437
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:35,194
- Paul.
- Jelly.

1438
01:17:35,362 --> 01:17:36,696
Feeling all right?

1439
01:17:36,905 --> 01:17:38,322
You need anything?

1440
01:17:38,532 --> 01:17:41,492
No. Feel great. Never felt better.

1441
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:46,248
Wait'll I go to that meeting.
I'm going to knock them dead.

1442
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:49,251
All right. I'll be outside.

1443
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:57,050
When I look at him...

1444
01:17:57,218 --> 01:17:59,761
...I think about
how different it was.

1445
01:17:59,929 --> 01:18:02,639
Was providing for a family
simpler back then...

1446
01:18:02,849 --> 01:18:05,642
...or did he just make it
look that way?

1447
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:10,939
Decisions are tougher now.

1448
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,649
There's so much information...

1449
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:15,277
...so many ways to invest.

1450
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:24,704
Strange. I spent the first half
of my life...

1451
01:18:24,914 --> 01:18:27,165
...not wanting to walk
in his footsteps.

1452
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,584
Now I only wish I could.

1453
01:18:32,922 --> 01:18:34,839
Times are more complex.

1454
01:18:35,049 --> 01:18:38,051
Ask a Merrill Lynch financial
consultant who can help with a plan.

1455
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,888
And more ways to make
the plan work than anyone else.

1456
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:54,734
You look beautiful, honey.

1457
01:19:06,372 --> 01:19:09,624
We are put on this earth
to find a love, a soul mate...

1458
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:12,710
...someone with whom
we can create joy.

1459
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,087
And how glad we are...

1460
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:16,047
...that Ben and Laura
have found each other.

1461
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:19,510
And we anticipate and celebrate
the years ofjoy...

1462
01:19:19,978 --> 01:19:22,680
... they will share together from this day on.

1463
01:19:23,515 --> 01:19:26,767
Ben, do you take Laura to be
your wedded wife...

1464
01:19:26,977 --> 01:19:29,061
...for richer or poorer,
in sickness and in health...

1465
01:19:29,229 --> 01:19:31,480
...till death do you part, so help you God?

1466
01:19:31,648 --> 01:19:32,731
- No!
- What?

1467
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:34,108
Excuse me?

1468
01:19:34,275 --> 01:19:36,443
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to him.

1469
01:19:36,611 --> 01:19:37,945
Who him?

1470
01:19:38,113 --> 01:19:39,405
It's not important. Yes.

1471
01:19:39,781 --> 01:19:40,864
Yes what?

1472
01:19:41,074 --> 01:19:42,992
Yes to the first part. To her.

1473
01:19:43,201 --> 01:19:45,244
That's a yes. Pick it up from there.

1474
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:47,746
Doc, this is an emergency.

1475
01:19:47,956 --> 01:19:50,000
- I don't believe this.
- This is my wedding!

1476
01:19:50,167 --> 01:19:52,168
- Want me to make a scene?
- Bigger than this?

1477
01:19:52,336 --> 01:19:54,254
- Yeah.
- Jesus!

1478
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,923
Tick-tock. Let's go.
Hurry up. Pronounce.

1479
01:19:57,133 --> 01:20:00,176
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1480
01:20:01,137 --> 01:20:02,554
Ring, ring. Kiss, kiss.

1481
01:20:04,265 --> 01:20:06,599
Here. Fine. Good.
Okay, just go.

1482
01:20:06,767 --> 01:20:09,102
Sorry, Mrs. Sobel. Duty calls.

1483
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:11,896
You're the first person to
call me Mrs. Sobel.

1484
01:20:12,064 --> 01:20:14,315
- Nice, huh?
- No.

1485
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:26,120
I'm telling you, Doc,
this is serious.

1486
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:28,497
If he don't make that meeting,
they'll kill him.

1487
01:20:28,749 --> 01:20:30,791
Can't somebody else
in the family go for him?

1488
01:20:31,084 --> 01:20:34,211
What about Tommy the Tongue
or Louie the Lip?

1489
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:36,172
What about you? Why don't you go?

1490
01:20:36,339 --> 01:20:39,633
That would be a very good idea,
except for one little detail.

1491
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:42,845
I'm a fucking moron.
I'm known for it.

1492
01:20:43,013 --> 01:20:45,097
- You got to go.
- You must be a moron.

1493
01:20:45,265 --> 01:20:46,849
- Watch it!
- You just said it.

1494
01:20:47,017 --> 01:20:50,311
When I say it, it's different.
When you say it, it sounds negative.

1495
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:52,813
Jelly, I am not going to any meeting.

1496
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:55,483
I am no longer on the payroll.
Do you understand that?

1497
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,277
Now, I am going back to my wife.

1498
01:20:58,445 --> 01:21:02,323
- Doc.
- Jelly, don't...

1499
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:04,867
Now, Jelly,
we've been through this before.

1500
01:21:05,118 --> 01:21:06,535
You can't shoot me.

1501
01:21:06,703 --> 01:21:08,454
Correction:

1502
01:21:08,622 --> 01:21:11,165
It was Mr. Vitti who couldn't shoot you.

1503
01:21:12,793 --> 01:21:14,960
You're going to that meeting.

1504
01:21:19,299 --> 01:21:22,761
This is Surveillance 6. They've left
the building and are heading east.

1505
01:21:22,929 --> 01:21:24,638
Roger that.

1506
01:21:27,725 --> 01:21:29,184
Put this on.
- Is this chrome?

1507
01:21:29,393 --> 01:21:30,811
I can see my own reflection.

1508
01:21:30,978 --> 01:21:34,481
Let me tell you something.
That's a $1,200 Valentino suit.

1509
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:38,235
If you spill anything on it,
I'm going to mess you up good.

1510
01:21:38,486 --> 01:21:40,737
Shut up! You're making him nervous.

1511
01:21:40,988 --> 01:21:43,198
If he fucks up,
they'll kill him for sure.

1512
01:21:43,366 --> 01:21:46,076
- What? This is insane!
- It's all right.

1513
01:21:46,327 --> 01:21:49,079
Let's go over it again.
Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1514
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:52,041
Apologies all around.
Ba-da-beep, ba-da-bop, ba-da-boop.

1515
01:21:52,209 --> 01:21:54,836
And then you say
you're the new consigliere...

1516
01:21:55,045 --> 01:21:57,755
...speaking for Mr. Vitti.
- Then what?

1517
01:21:57,965 --> 01:22:01,592
Then you keep your mouth shut
and hope nobody asks you nothing.

1518
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,719
That's some plan you got there.

1519
01:22:03,887 --> 01:22:07,431
Shut up! Doc, if you got to talk...

1520
01:22:07,599 --> 01:22:09,934
...try to be vague.
Could you do that?

1521
01:22:10,102 --> 01:22:12,979
I'm a psychiatrist.
Believe me, I can be vague.

1522
01:22:15,941 --> 01:22:18,526
Looks like they're headed for the tunnel.

1523
01:22:20,445 --> 01:22:23,532
We'll pick them up on the other side.

1524
01:22:28,121 --> 01:22:29,621
Here they come.

1525
01:22:33,251 --> 01:22:34,543
Which one is it?

1526
01:22:34,711 --> 01:22:36,420
The black one.

1527
01:22:48,558 --> 01:22:50,851
Are you sure you don't want
something to eat?

1528
01:22:52,645 --> 01:22:54,563
You want some iced tea?

1529
01:22:56,065 --> 01:22:58,275
I think I'm going to call
Dr. Terragrossa.

1530
01:22:58,443 --> 01:23:00,444
Is Daddy going to be all right?

1531
01:23:01,946 --> 01:23:03,739
I think so, honey.

1532
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:06,617
Shouldn't you be outside playing?

1533
01:23:06,784 --> 01:23:08,869
No, it's all right.

1534
01:23:10,205 --> 01:23:11,830
How long you going to sit there?

1535
01:23:11,998 --> 01:23:14,208
How long you going to lay there?

1536
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:19,922
I'm done.

1537
01:23:57,504 --> 01:23:59,088
Let's go.

1538
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,299
It'll be all right, Doc.

1539
01:24:17,983 --> 01:24:20,401
There's no way I can get away with this.

1540
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:22,319
Jelly, I can't do this!

1541
01:24:22,529 --> 01:24:24,238
Don't fucking whine.

1542
01:24:24,489 --> 01:24:26,741
Whining's a dead giveaway.

1543
01:24:26,993 --> 01:24:28,451
Blend.

1544
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:30,036
Blend in.

1545
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:31,830
Oh.

1546
01:24:31,998 --> 01:24:35,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

1547
01:24:35,376 --> 01:24:36,835
Oh.

1548
01:24:37,003 --> 01:24:38,837
So where's Vitti?

1549
01:24:39,005 --> 01:24:41,756
He ain't here.

1550
01:24:41,924 --> 01:24:43,883
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

1551
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:46,177
How you been? All right?

1552
01:24:46,345 --> 01:24:47,887
All right.

1553
01:24:48,055 --> 01:24:50,223
Hey, when'd you guys get out?

1554
01:24:50,391 --> 01:24:52,392
You need anything, you let me know.

1555
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:02,068
Hey. Easter weekend.

1556
01:25:03,738 --> 01:25:05,113
You're a planet!

1557
01:25:09,035 --> 01:25:10,744
Blending, enough.

1558
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:15,248
Who's the guy with Jelly?

1559
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:17,125
I never seen him before.

1560
01:25:22,715 --> 01:25:26,134
Hey. What's going on? Where's Paul?

1561
01:25:26,302 --> 01:25:27,928
He'll be here. Don't worry.

1562
01:25:28,096 --> 01:25:30,765
And what's he doing here?

1563
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:32,266
He's just...

1564
01:25:32,434 --> 01:25:34,769
It's okay. Forget about it.

1565
01:25:34,936 --> 01:25:36,395
Forget about it?

1566
01:25:36,563 --> 01:25:39,065
What the hell is that?
"Forget about it. "

1567
01:25:39,232 --> 01:25:42,443
I can't do this. No, I can't do this.

1568
01:25:43,278 --> 01:25:45,404
I think we're going to get started here.

1569
01:25:45,614 --> 01:25:48,032
We got a lot to talk about
here today, and...

1570
01:25:48,241 --> 01:25:51,285
...for now, we'll just stick
with the more important issues.

1571
01:25:51,453 --> 01:25:54,622
And one more thing.
If you got anything to say...

1572
01:25:54,831 --> 01:25:57,959
...let us know who you are, because
a lot of us don't know each other.

1573
01:25:58,169 --> 01:26:02,005
I didn't think anybody here was
into wearing fucking nametags.

1574
01:26:11,474 --> 01:26:13,183
I'm Primo Sindone.

1575
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,352
They call me Sonny Long.

1576
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:18,021
Some of you know me
as Mikey Gaga.

1577
01:26:18,272 --> 01:26:20,148
Some of you know me
as Joey Boombots.

1578
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:24,111
Be as it may, it's good to see
so many of the old faces here...

1579
01:26:24,278 --> 01:26:27,155
...and to welcome some of the new ones
from all over the country.

1580
01:26:28,408 --> 01:26:29,826
I see Joe Baldassare...

1581
01:26:29,993 --> 01:26:31,119
...Frankie Zello.

1582
01:26:32,663 --> 01:26:36,541
But I'm disappointed the head of
our other New York family isn't here.

1583
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:40,920
All I see is his man Jelly
and some sawed-off prick nobody knows.

1584
01:26:45,843 --> 01:26:48,845
Yeah. Well, uh...

1585
01:26:49,012 --> 01:26:50,847
The thing is...

1586
01:26:51,014 --> 01:26:54,183
...Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1587
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:57,186
Plus, he's sorry...

1588
01:26:57,396 --> 01:26:58,688
...for his detainment.

1589
01:26:58,939 --> 01:27:00,273
Detained?

1590
01:27:00,441 --> 01:27:02,233
What kind of bullshit is that?

1591
01:27:02,401 --> 01:27:04,360
What's more important than this?

1592
01:27:04,570 --> 01:27:08,364
As the host, I take his not being here
as a sign of disrespect to me...

1593
01:27:08,532 --> 01:27:12,076
...and all these other men
who came a long way to be here.

1594
01:27:12,244 --> 01:27:14,787
Yeah. I mean, no. I mean...

1595
01:27:14,997 --> 01:27:17,623
You see, the thing is that
he's not feeling well.

1596
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:21,210
- Plus, he don't feel good.
- Jelly.

1597
01:27:22,171 --> 01:27:23,754
What's the matter with you?

1598
01:27:23,922 --> 01:27:26,215
We never discuss Mr. Vitti's health
outside the family.

1599
01:27:26,383 --> 01:27:28,217
You know better than that.

1600
01:27:28,635 --> 01:27:30,471
Sit down.

1601
01:27:30,638 --> 01:27:32,514
Sit down!

1602
01:27:32,682 --> 01:27:34,808
You want a fresh one?

1603
01:27:37,604 --> 01:27:40,564
Who is this guy?
What the fuck is he doing here?

1604
01:27:40,773 --> 01:27:41,815
Who I am?

1605
01:27:42,025 --> 01:27:43,901
"Who I am?" "Who am I?"

1606
01:27:44,068 --> 01:27:45,903
"Who am I?" is a question
for the ages.

1607
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:48,906
That's one we're all searching for,
to find out who I am.

1608
01:27:49,073 --> 01:27:51,241
Who's in there, who wants
to come out and go:

1609
01:27:51,409 --> 01:27:52,743
"Hey, I'm hungry. "

1610
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:54,620
"Who I am"...

1611
01:27:54,954 --> 01:27:57,080
...is too deep and...

1612
01:27:57,373 --> 01:27:59,333
You got to go in deep
and pull out the thing...

1613
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:02,420
...like that movie where the thing
came out of the stomach...

1614
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:04,881
...and ate the people on
the fucking spaceship.

1615
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,633
May they rest in peace.

1616
01:28:06,884 --> 01:28:08,760
My name is Ben Sobel.

1617
01:28:10,137 --> 01:28:11,262
Leone.

1618
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:12,805
Ben Soboleone.

1619
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,807
I'm also known...

1620
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:18,895
...as Benny the Groin,
Sammy the Schnoz...

1621
01:28:19,104 --> 01:28:21,481
...Elmer the Fudd,
Tubby the Tuba...

1622
01:28:21,732 --> 01:28:24,234
...and once as
Miss Phyllis Levine.

1623
01:28:24,443 --> 01:28:26,486
But that was at a party.
It was years ago.

1624
01:28:26,737 --> 01:28:29,030
I smoked a titibet,
and I had a Quaquaalude...

1625
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,951
...and suddenly I'm in fishnets
singing show tunes.

1626
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,495
These things happen,
but has nothing to do...

1627
01:28:34,746 --> 01:28:37,456
...with what I'm here
with you fine gentlemen today.

1628
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:38,791
So I apologize.

1629
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,962
That being said, I'm also known to
the people who know me the best...

1630
01:28:43,171 --> 01:28:45,214
...as the fucking Doctor.

1631
01:28:45,757 --> 01:28:49,885
The second part of your question
that you asked me...

1632
01:28:50,095 --> 01:28:53,305
...is "Why am I here?"
I am here...

1633
01:28:53,974 --> 01:28:57,268
...representing Mr. Paul Vitti
as his consigligliere.

1634
01:28:59,354 --> 01:29:01,063
Consigliere.

1635
01:29:04,025 --> 01:29:06,610
Never correct me in public again.

1636
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:08,654
Do you understand that?

1637
01:29:10,156 --> 01:29:11,991
You broke my heart, Jelly.

1638
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:14,243
You broke my heart.

1639
01:29:16,871 --> 01:29:20,082
I apologize for
the second interruption.

1640
01:29:21,626 --> 01:29:23,544
As Mr. Vitti's...

1641
01:29:23,837 --> 01:29:26,547
...consigliere...

1642
01:29:27,173 --> 01:29:30,634
...I am involved in all aspects
of the Vitti family business...

1643
01:29:30,844 --> 01:29:33,345
...and am prepared to speak
for Mr. Vitti on all matters.

1644
01:29:33,639 --> 01:29:35,682
Badda-bing-badda-boom-Betty Boop.

1645
01:29:36,309 --> 01:29:37,976
Okay, Doctor.

1646
01:29:38,185 --> 01:29:40,020
Let's stop with the bullshit.

1647
01:29:42,898 --> 01:29:44,816
There's been this thing
between me...

1648
01:29:45,026 --> 01:29:46,651
...and Paul Vitti for a long time.

1649
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:51,406
Are you talking about the first thing
or the second thing?

1650
01:29:51,824 --> 01:29:53,867
What second thing?
I only know one thing.

1651
01:29:54,827 --> 01:29:58,371
How can we bring up the first
if we don't talk about the second?

1652
01:29:58,581 --> 01:30:01,333
- Did you talk to the guy?
- What guy?

1653
01:30:02,168 --> 01:30:03,877
The guy with the thing!

1654
01:30:04,086 --> 01:30:06,005
What thing?
What are you talking about?

1655
01:30:06,214 --> 01:30:08,215
How should I know?
You brought it up!

1656
01:30:08,425 --> 01:30:10,384
This is the problem.
Do you see this?

1657
01:30:10,552 --> 01:30:12,219
You see what's happening here?

1658
01:30:12,429 --> 01:30:16,098
You can't have an intelligent
conversation with this guy.

1659
01:30:18,268 --> 01:30:21,604
What if I put two bullets in your brain?
What do you think of that?

1660
01:30:21,855 --> 01:30:24,398
That's a little dark.
What do you think?

1661
01:30:24,608 --> 01:30:28,569
It's a good idea. Why would I say
it if I didn't think it was good?

1662
01:30:28,737 --> 01:30:29,904
I don't know. Why would you?

1663
01:30:31,239 --> 01:30:34,075
I wouldn't! That's what I'm saying!

1664
01:30:34,242 --> 01:30:37,412
Look at what's happening here.
Look at you.

1665
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:41,750
Do you feel you have to get angry
so people will listen to you?

1666
01:30:41,918 --> 01:30:44,378
- Is that your deal?
- What is he saying?

1667
01:30:44,587 --> 01:30:47,172
You do have a tendency
to get angry a lot.

1668
01:30:47,382 --> 01:30:48,882
I agree, Primo.

1669
01:30:49,092 --> 01:30:51,635
Talk about Vitti.
Why are we talking about me?

1670
01:30:51,803 --> 01:30:53,887
Oh! That's interesting too.

1671
01:30:54,138 --> 01:30:58,725
Do you feel you're not important
enough for us to discuss you?

1672
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:00,644
- What does that mean?
- What do you think?

1673
01:31:00,895 --> 01:31:03,939
- Fuck you!
- Primo, calm down.

1674
01:31:04,148 --> 01:31:06,400
This prick won't stop
with the questions.

1675
01:31:06,567 --> 01:31:08,735
- Pass the fruit, please.
- You're a dead man!

1676
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:12,698
Primo! Primo!

1677
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:17,953
Put it down.

1678
01:31:24,085 --> 01:31:25,877
Wait in the car. Keep it running.

1679
01:31:26,045 --> 01:31:27,462
How are you feeling?

1680
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:29,131
Sit down. I'll take it from here.

1681
01:31:29,382 --> 01:31:31,925
Sit down. Sit down.

1682
01:31:33,636 --> 01:31:35,470
I'm Paul Vitti.

1683
01:31:35,638 --> 01:31:39,976
I'm sorry I was late. Those who know me
know I meant no disrespect.

1684
01:31:40,144 --> 01:31:41,936
If it's all right with you...

1685
01:31:42,187 --> 01:31:45,565
...I just want to say something.
Then I'll leave you to your business.

1686
01:31:45,774 --> 01:31:50,695
About two and a half weeks ago, somebody
killed my dear friend, Dominic Manetta.

1687
01:31:51,655 --> 01:31:53,156
Come on, this is bullshit.

1688
01:31:53,323 --> 01:31:56,451
Everybody knows he whacked out Dominic
so he could take over.

1689
01:31:56,618 --> 01:31:58,035
Whatever.

1690
01:31:58,203 --> 01:32:03,082
What I came to say is I've come to
a very important decision in my life.

1691
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:04,667
And that is...

1692
01:32:05,627 --> 01:32:07,211
...I want out.

1693
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,339
I don't want to do this no more.

1694
01:32:10,842 --> 01:32:12,843
I'm going to go away for a while...

1695
01:32:13,011 --> 01:32:16,180
...but I will respect the oath
I took the day I was made...

1696
01:32:16,347 --> 01:32:19,850
...and what I know about anybody's
business I take to the grave.

1697
01:32:20,018 --> 01:32:21,727
You have my word.

1698
01:32:22,729 --> 01:32:25,230
As for my own family...

1699
01:32:25,398 --> 01:32:28,484
...I know Carlo Mangano would
like to be the new boss.

1700
01:32:28,693 --> 01:32:29,902
Thank you, Paul.

1701
01:32:30,069 --> 01:32:32,362
That's why he betrayed Dominic
and me to our enemies...

1702
01:32:32,530 --> 01:32:34,990
...and sent his own man
to Miami to try and kill me.

1703
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,035
- I swear you got this wrong...
- Shut your mouth.

1704
01:32:39,038 --> 01:32:41,289
Even though it's my right,
I won't take revenge.

1705
01:32:41,457 --> 01:32:44,125
You want to know why?
Because you got a problem.

1706
01:32:44,293 --> 01:32:46,044
A problem with aggression.

1707
01:32:46,212 --> 01:32:47,921
Maybe you weren't hugged as a kid.

1708
01:32:48,172 --> 01:32:50,006
You ought to look inside yourself...

1709
01:32:50,216 --> 01:32:53,843
...look inside
and find out who you are.

1710
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:55,720
Because for me...

1711
01:32:55,888 --> 01:32:57,222
...I had a breakthrough.

1712
01:32:57,389 --> 01:33:01,559
I'm in a good place mentally,
and I'm feeling good about me.

1713
01:33:02,895 --> 01:33:04,979
I don't know, Paul.

1714
01:33:05,147 --> 01:33:08,983
I can see where some people
might have a problem with this.

1715
01:33:09,151 --> 01:33:12,111
I realize that.
So as a token of good faith...

1716
01:33:12,363 --> 01:33:14,614
...I've taken the liberty
of writing down a few things...

1717
01:33:14,865 --> 01:33:17,408
...putting them in a safe-deposit
box in case...

1718
01:33:17,618 --> 01:33:20,578
...something should happen to me,
my friend or my family.

1719
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,713
I don't know what anybody else thinks...

1720
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:33,591
...but I say good luck and God bless, Paul.

1721
01:33:38,222 --> 01:33:40,307
Thank you. Come on, let's go.

1722
01:33:40,725 --> 01:33:43,477
- I'm his friend.
Come on.

1723
01:33:50,318 --> 01:33:52,570
That was remarkable.
Do you feel proud?

1724
01:33:52,779 --> 01:33:56,407
Some people in therapy never
have breakthroughs like you had.

1725
01:33:56,575 --> 01:33:58,075
Hey, Paul!

1726
01:33:59,578 --> 01:34:00,953
I don't want to do this.

1727
01:34:01,162 --> 01:34:05,124
Think this is a civil service job?
You can just quit and walk away?

1728
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:06,959
What are you, fucking crazy?

1729
01:34:07,168 --> 01:34:08,794
Not anymore.

1730
01:34:08,962 --> 01:34:10,337
Tell me something.

1731
01:34:10,505 --> 01:34:13,633
Will you stab me in the back like
the shit I always knew you were?

1732
01:34:13,801 --> 01:34:16,136
No, I won't stab you in the back.

1733
01:34:16,304 --> 01:34:18,179
I want to see your face when I do it.

1734
01:34:18,347 --> 01:34:20,974
Yeah? I don't think so.

1735
01:34:21,183 --> 01:34:22,642
Mo-Mo!

1736
01:34:23,477 --> 01:34:24,769
Bigs!

1737
01:34:24,979 --> 01:34:26,521
Eddie!

1738
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31,818
It's over, Primo.

1739
01:34:31,986 --> 01:34:33,987
Now get the fuck out of here.

1740
01:34:41,997 --> 01:34:44,332
Machine gun was a nice touch.
A little hostile.

1741
01:35:18,533 --> 01:35:20,201
Hands in the air!

1742
01:35:20,369 --> 01:35:21,786
Drop your weapons!

1743
01:35:21,995 --> 01:35:23,537
Do it now!

1744
01:35:35,342 --> 01:35:37,176
I got you! Get down!

1745
01:35:41,431 --> 01:35:43,767
Get out of the car!
Hands on top of the car!

1746
01:35:43,977 --> 01:35:47,062
One fucking move, I swear I'll
blow your fucking heart out!

1747
01:35:47,271 --> 01:35:49,940
Take a pill, RoboCop! Take a pill!

1748
01:35:51,859 --> 01:35:53,902
I can't believe this.
You took a bullet for me.

1749
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:57,781
What doc would ever do that for his
patient? I'll never forget that.

1750
01:35:57,991 --> 01:35:59,825
You... You...

1751
01:35:59,993 --> 01:36:02,119
Paul, I tripped.

1752
01:36:02,328 --> 01:36:05,247
Oh, yeah, you tripped. Heh. You tripped
over your unconscious.

1753
01:36:06,290 --> 01:36:09,876
Mr. Vitti, you have the right
to remain silent...

1754
01:36:13,589 --> 01:36:15,466
Today's my wedding day.

1755
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:29,105
You got off easy.
Eighteen months is nothing.

1756
01:36:29,314 --> 01:36:32,233
They found Primo Sindone dead
in a field near La Guardia.

1757
01:36:32,443 --> 01:36:35,403
I heard. Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with it.

1758
01:36:35,612 --> 01:36:39,615
A million guys from here to Canarsie
were looking to whack that bastard.

1759
01:36:39,825 --> 01:36:41,993
Good. I was just checking.

1760
01:36:42,536 --> 01:36:43,578
Don't worry.

1761
01:36:45,248 --> 01:36:48,500
You think we could keep going
with the private sessions up here?

1762
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:50,252
You'd like to do that?

1763
01:36:51,046 --> 01:36:54,465
I could arrange to come up on Saturdays.
Or we could do it by phone.

1764
01:36:54,674 --> 01:36:55,799
Phone appointments?

1765
01:36:56,009 --> 01:36:59,845
I do that when a patient's
out of town or in federal prison.

1766
01:37:06,352 --> 01:37:07,478
Thanks, Doc.

1767
01:37:12,984 --> 01:37:14,818
- Hey, doc.
- Yeah?

1768
01:37:15,862 --> 01:37:18,614
I never really got to
thank you properly...

1769
01:37:19,699 --> 01:37:20,783
...for curing me.

1770
01:37:22,285 --> 01:37:25,704
We don't say "cure. " We say you had a
"corrective emotional experience. "

1771
01:37:25,914 --> 01:37:27,164
Excuse me.

1772
01:37:27,332 --> 01:37:29,792
Heh, heh. You. You're something, you.

1773
01:37:30,001 --> 01:37:32,503
- Yes, you are. You are something.
- You. You.

1774
01:37:33,421 --> 01:37:35,839
- No, you're something.
- No, you.

1775
01:37:36,007 --> 01:37:37,049
You!

1776
01:37:45,725 --> 01:37:47,227
- Happy?
The best is yet to come

1777
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:48,937
I just can't get used to it.

1778
01:37:49,105 --> 01:37:50,146
Used to what?

1779
01:37:50,356 --> 01:37:52,440
It's been so long since
you were kidnapped.

1780
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:53,817
I don't know if I can adjust.

1781
01:37:53,984 --> 01:37:56,236
Out of the tree of life

1782
01:37:56,403 --> 01:37:58,363
Listen.

1783
01:37:58,531 --> 01:38:01,157
How about one more dance...

1784
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:04,369
...and then we'll go upstairs?
- Okay.

1785
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:09,165
Tony, can you do one more song?

1786
01:38:09,959 --> 01:38:11,209
Oh, anything you want.

1787
01:38:11,377 --> 01:38:14,671
You know, my friend told me to stay
as long as you needed me.

1788
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,172
I don't want to let him down.

1789
01:38:16,382 --> 01:38:18,843
"World On A String,"
the Harold Arlen song.

1790
01:38:19,052 --> 01:38:20,344
This is so great.

1791
01:38:22,514 --> 01:38:23,639
This is a gift.

1792
01:38:23,807 --> 01:38:26,767
I've got the world on a string

1793
01:38:28,186 --> 01:38:30,896
I'm sitting on a rainbow

1794
01:38:31,523 --> 01:38:36,485
I've got the string around my finger

1795
01:38:37,946 --> 01:38:40,948
What a world, what a life

1796
01:38:42,367 --> 01:38:44,451
I'm in love

1797
01:38:48,916 --> 01:38:52,752
I've got a song that I sing

1798
01:38:53,087 --> 01:38:56,131
I can make the rain go

1799
01:38:56,841 --> 01:39:02,012
Any time I move my finger

1800
01:39:03,055 --> 01:39:07,475
Lucky me, can't you see?

1801
01:39:07,643 --> 01:39:10,187
I'm in love

1802
01:39:12,356 --> 01:39:16,443
Life is a beautiful thing

1803
01:39:18,613 --> 01:39:22,449
As long as I hold that string

1804
01:39:25,328 --> 01:39:28,788
I'd be a silly so-and-so

1805
01:39:31,042 --> 01:39:34,502
If I should ever let go

1806
01:39:38,591 --> 01:39:41,843
I've got the world on a string

1807
01:39:42,345 --> 01:39:46,097
I'm sitting on a rainbow

1808
01:39:46,265 --> 01:39:51,562
I've got the string around my finger

1809
01:39:52,231 --> 01:39:56,275
What a world, what a life

1810
01:39:56,443 --> 01:40:03,449
I'm in love

1811
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:06,327
Good night, Sobels.

1812
01:40:07,305 --> 01:41:07,789
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
