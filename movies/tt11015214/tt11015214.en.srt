feetfirst with your

all of a sudden,
you feel your feet go up.

272

<i>the Cannonball Loop</i>

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,008
if you were too small.

301
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,013
You couldn't go down
the Cannonball Loop

302
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:08,022
if you were too big.

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,008
Too big, you'd get stuck.

304
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,016
Too small,
you wouldn't get up

305
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:13,011
enough momentum
to make the loop.

306
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:16,002
There was a trapdoor
at the top that they--

307
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,017
that's how they would extricate
people from the loop

308
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:20,001
if they got stuck.

309
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:22,016
<i>- So as you entered the park,</i>

310
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:25,001
<i>you saw this thing.</i>

311
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,015
<i>It was one of the things that,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

312
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:28,012
<i>you had kind of heard</i>
<i>whispers about.</i>

313
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:30,003
So right away, you walk in,
you're like,

314
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:32,009
"Well, that's real.
This shit's real."

315
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:37,003
<i>I did get hurt on a ride</i>

316
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:39,009
<i>that was called</i>
<i>Cannonball Falls.</i>

317
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:41,009
And it looked like
a pretty normal waterslide.

318
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:43,011
<i>You'd sit down.</i>
<i>You'd go down the waterslide.</i>

319
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,016
What is not discernible
from the top

320
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,008
is that at some point,
you come around a corner,

321
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,005
<i>and there's</i>
<i>this big black tunnel.</i>

322
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:51,013
You feel like,
all of a sudden,

323
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:52,021
you're just going faster
as well.

324
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:54,006
And I'll never forget.

325
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going down this waterslide.

326
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,004
I enter the tunnel, and you
just hear people, "Oh, no!"

327
00:13:58,006 --> 00:13:59,023
Ahead of you--
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!"

328
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,010
So you're like, "What--
what's going on here?"

329
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:05,002
<i>And then you'd see</i>
<i>this little piece of light</i>

330
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:06,014
<i>at the bottom of the tunnel,</i>

331
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:08,011
<i>and then you'd just get</i>
<i>shot out.</i>

332
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,018
<i>And you'd just be there in</i>
<i>the middle of, like, the air.</i>

333
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,010
And I'm not kidding when I say

334
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:15,017
you're, at minimum,
ten feet in the air.

335
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:18,010
<i>It shoots you out</i>
<i>the side of a mountain,</i>

336
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:21,002
and you're just, like,
in the sky.

337
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:23,010
You think you're getting
on a waterslide,

338
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:26,021
and the next thing you know,
you're in the fucking sky, man!

339
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:28,015
<i>- And yes,</i>
<i>you were over water,</i>

340
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:30,007
<i>but there was a few seconds</i>
<i>where you'd be like,</i>

341
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,011
<i>"I'm gonna fucking die.</i>
<i>What am I doing?"</i>

342
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:34,002
And you just look around,

343
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:35,022
and then gravity would take you
down into the water.

344
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,000
<i>- And you're in</i>
<i>ice-cold water, 17 feet deep,</i>

345
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:41,018
so people were constantly
getting pulled out of there

346
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,011
for, you know,
being unable to swim

347
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:47,008
or just landing wrong
and being disoriented.

348
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,023
- There's nothing in the world
like Action Park.

349
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,022
<i>- The rides that got built</i>
<i>at Action Park</i>

350
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,001
would often come to Gene

351
00:14:57,003 --> 00:15:00,003
through people
who just had a wild hair

352
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:03,009
<i>and wanted to build</i>
<i>this crazy idea that they had.</i>

353
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:05,018
- A certain number
of the Action Park rides

354
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,011
were more or less
designed in-house

355
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:12,005
by people
without engineering degrees,

356
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:14,005
and I was certainly
one of them.

357
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:15,014
- The people who were kind of

358
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:17,015
on the fringes
of the ride-design world,

359
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:21,011
<i>people who Six Flags or Disney</i>
<i>wanted nothing to do with,</i>

360
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:24,015
<i>these guys would literally</i>
<i>track Gene down</i>

361
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:27,006
<i>at amusement industry</i>
<i>conventions.</i>

362
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,012
- You could tell these guys
went and did bumps of coke,

363
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:31,008
<i>and were like, "Let's</i>
<i>fucking-- let's drill a slide</i>

364
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,004
<i>"right through the fucking</i>
<i>middle of a mountain,</i>

365
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:35,012
<i>and it'll shoot them</i>
<i>20 feet in the fucking air!"</i>

366
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:37,015
You just couldn't
trust anything there.

367
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:39,012
- Guys would come to us,
and no matter

368
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:42,012
what the idea was,
my father would try it.

369
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:45,014
<i>- And then when each of these</i>
<i>rides went into construction,</i>

370
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:49,015
Gene would change them
drastically.

371
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,023
<i>Action Park's</i>
<i>most prolific ride designer</i>

372
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,009
<i>was none other</i>
<i>than Gene himself.</i>

373
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:56,020
<i>After designs came in,</i>
<i>he would almost always</i>

374
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:59,000
<i>tinker with them</i>
<i>during construction,</i>

375
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:03,000
<i>making them bigger, badder,</i>
<i>more extreme.</i>

376
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:04,015
<i>And the Cannonball Loop?</i>

377
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:06,005
<i>Its design actually came about</i>

378
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,019
<i>when Gene drew a circle</i>
<i>on a cocktail napkin</i>

379
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:12,017
<i>and hired some local welders</i>
<i>to put it all together.</i>

380
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,017
- Many of the rides
were experimental,

381
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:16,017
and on paper,
the design looked good.

382
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,005
But in reality,
once the ride was turned on,

383
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:22,009
it was not fit for a safe ride

384
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:24,022
by the average person
in public.

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,008
<i>- One of those rides was</i>

386
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,002
<i>the Man in the Ball</i>
<i>in the Ball.</i>

387
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:29,019
The Man in the Ball
in the Ball

388
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:32,010
was this giant ball
that we had

389
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:34,018
with ball bearings inside it
with another ball,

390
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,001
and you would open up two doors

391
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:37,009
<i>and get in the ball</i>

392
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:38,018
<i>to go down the mountain.</i>

393
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,011
<i>And what he did is,</i>
<i>the guy built it</i>

394
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:43,016
<i>with PVC pipe</i>
<i>all the way down the mountain.</i>

395
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,009
<i>- Like, it's a great idea;</i>
<i>you can see how someone</i>

396
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:47,002
<i>would think that'd be</i>
<i>a lot of fun,</i>

397
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:49,011
and I think it might work
and be relatively safe.

398
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:52,010
It turned out, you know,
there were limitations to it.

399
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,021
- It's a crazy concept.

400
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:58,003
I mean, it's so big
and so heavy and so unwieldy

401
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:00,014
that there's no way it's gonna
stay in any kind of track.

402
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:03,005
<i>- The day that we were gonna</i>
<i>put a live man in it,</i>

403
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:04,018
<i>it got really hot,</i>

404
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,020
<i>and he didn't realize</i>
<i>that PVC expanded.</i>

405
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:09,004
<i>So when we put the live man</i>
<i>in the ball</i>

406
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:11,012
<i>and tested it</i>
<i>to go down the mountain,</i>

407
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:13,004
<i>the ride just fell apart.</i>

408
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:15,004
<i>And the guy ended up</i>
<i>going down the ski slope,</i>

409
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:18,004
<i>right over 94,</i>
<i>into the swamp down below.</i>

410
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:21,004
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

411
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,004
<i>Another</i>
<i>prototype waterslide</i>

412
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:26,012
<i>was inspired</i>
<i>by zero-gravity airplanes.</i>

413
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:30,008
<i>Riders</i>
<i>would actually take flight</i>

414
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,005
<i>as they plummeted downhill.</i>

415
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:35,012
<i>- We built this, and we tested</i>
<i>several versions of it,</i>

416
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:38,011
and we started sending
employees off of it.

417
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:40,014
<i>And it was working perfect.</i>

418
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:42,005
<i>But unfortunately,</i>

419
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:44,008
<i>after dozens</i>
<i>of successful test flights,</i>

420
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,009
<i>one went horribly wrong.</i>

421
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:50,006
- This one kid went down,
and I don't know how he did it,

422
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:52,011
<i>but he got himself going</i>
<i>way faster</i>

423
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:54,006
<i>than anybody else had.</i>

424
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:56,010
<i>He went way high in the air</i>

425
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:58,014
<i>and completely missed</i>
<i>the landing.</i>

426
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:01,016
He had to be backboarded
off of the ride.

427
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:04,004
He's gone on
to lead a normal life,

428
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:05,020
but he was hurt that day,

429
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:08,023
<i>and that was</i>
<i>the end of that ride.</i>

430
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,013
<i>While some rides</i>
<i>never made it</i>

431
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:11,023
<i>past the testing phase,</i>

432
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:15,007
<i>dozens of other</i>
<i>questionable ideas did.</i>

433
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:17,000
- Right here,
that's called the Speed Slide.

434
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:18,008
It's over seven stories.

435
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,009
They tell me that you go
over 60 miles an hour.

436
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,021
So tell me,
any preparations

437
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:23,020
as we're about to embark
on the Speed Slide?

438
00:18:23,022 --> 00:18:25,004
- Yeah,
Preparation H.

439
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,012
<i>- There was a canopy around</i>
<i>the first 20 feet or so</i>

440
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:32,003
<i>in case you flew off.</i>

441
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,010
<i>The idea was that it would</i>
<i>bounce you back in.</i>

442
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,005
You had a bar
you had to hold on to

443
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:38,015
and lower yourself
to vertical...

444
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,004
<i>- And you just drop.</i>

445
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:41,020
<i>And you've got to be</i>
<i>free-falling</i>

446
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:42,020
<i>for a few seconds,</i>

447
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:44,002

597
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:09,010
<i>at Action Park.</i>

598
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:14,010
<i>It wouldn't be uncommon</i>
<i>to use a new recruit</i>

599
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:16,020
as a victim in a drowning.

600
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:19,017
<i>In the water, we would spin</i>
<i>the new employee over</i>

601
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,005
<i>and put him on a backboard,</i>

602
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:24,001
strap him down real tight
while in the water,

603
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:26,005
and just leave him be.

604
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,009
<i>There are certainly things</i>
<i>that happened at Action Park</i>

605
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:30,009
that are never spoken about.

606
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,016
We lived through it,

607
00:24:31,018 --> 00:24:33,001
we regretted some
of the things we did,

608
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,023
but we don't talk about it.

609
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:36,015
<i>- I was probably</i>
<i>a security guard</i>

610
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:38,003
<i>for maybe three months,</i>

611
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:39,021
<i>and then they worked me up</i>
<i>to a supervisor</i>

612
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:42,007
and then assistant
and then, eventually,

613
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:43,018
if you stayed there
long enough

614
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,011
and you had
anything going for you,

615
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:46,022
they would make you
director of security.

616
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,008
So it's not as impressive
as it sounded.

617
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,013
<i>- Somehow I ended up</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

618
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:52,017
<i>Like, all the bread products</i>
<i>in there--</i>

619
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:53,020
<i>everything was stale.</i>

620
00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:54,022
<i>Everything was out of date.</i>

621
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,011
So what they would do is,

622
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:58,014
they would put
the big pot of water on

623
00:24:58,016 --> 00:25:01,000
and put, like,
a colander over the water

624
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:03,006
and then put the hot dog buns
in the colander

625
00:25:03,008 --> 00:25:05,018
and cover it with a towel,
and in five minutes,

626
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,017
<i>you'd have</i>
<i>moist hot dog buns again.</i>

627
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:09,014
Damn, how did
we not kill people?

628
00:25:09,016 --> 00:25:11,014
- I know there were people
older than them

629
00:25:11,016 --> 00:25:13,007
who owned it,
but you never saw them.

630
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:15,017
Just literally imagine
teenagers you know right now

631
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,004
opening an amusement park.

632
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:19,003
That's what it was.

633
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:20,018
<i>- Everybody worked</i>
<i>at Action Park</i>

634
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,010
<i>because you knew</i>
<i>you'd get hired.</i>

635
00:25:22,012 --> 00:25:24,018
<i>They'd give you as many hours</i>
<i>as you wanted.</i>

636
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,004
<i>But, you know,</i>

637
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:28,010
Action Park didn't care
about, like, labor laws.

638
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:31,008
It was like,
"Yeah, I just worked 46 hours.

639
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,019
Yeah, I'm 16."

640
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:34,007
<i>According to New Jersey law,</i>

641
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:35,023
<i>employees had to be</i>
<i>16 years old</i>

642
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,017
<i>in order to operate rides.</i>

643
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:40,019
<i>According to local newspapers,</i>
<i>kids as young as 14</i>

644
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:43,005
<i>were, in fact,</i>
<i>working in these roles.</i>

645
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:46,004
<i>- They were kids.</i>
<i>They were teenagers.</i>

646
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:49,003
<i>So I'm sure their priorities</i>
<i>were on, like, hooking up</i>

647
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,011
<i>and getting fucked up.</i>

648
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,018
- There was romance
between everybody.

649
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,002
<i>They were teenagers,</i>
<i>horny teenagers.</i>

650
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:57,019
<i>- At the top</i>
<i>of the Alpine Slide,</i>

651
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:59,014
<i>we had a shack,</i>
<i>like, where we kept</i>

652
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,023
<i>our employee carts,</i>

653
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:02,015
<i>where you would put</i>
<i>your backpacks,</i>

654
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:03,022
<i>where you kept your water.</i>

655
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,003
People would go in the shed

656
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,015
to smoke weed and have sex.

657
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:08,015
<i>That's what they would do</i>
<i>in that shed.</i>

658
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:11,010
<i>Why anybody would want to have</i>
<i>sex in there, I can't fathom,</i>

659
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:15,009
<i>because it was always, like,</i>
<i>95,000 degrees in that thing.</i>

660
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:18,016
<i>And it always stunk</i>
<i>like dirty backpacks,</i>

661
00:26:18,018 --> 00:26:21,014
feet, weed,
and just ball sweat.

662
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:24,001
<i>- There are definitely people</i>
<i>who worked at Action Park</i>

663
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:25,023
<i>who have stories about that's</i>
<i>the first time they fingered</i>

664
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,013
<i>and/or got fingered.</i>

665
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:29,000
Like, clearly,
a lot of fingering

666
00:26:29,002 --> 00:26:30,013
going on after hours,
I would imagine.

667
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:32,003
There's a child
who was conceived

668
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,015
at Action Park, right?

669
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:35,000
There's some kid who's, like--

670
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,015
you know,
his name's Adam Peter

671
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,018
'cause his initials are AP
'cause he got conceived

672
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,021
<i>down behind the bumper boats</i>
<i>on one hot summer eve.</i>

673
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:45,008
<i>- Now, I was a good girl,</i>
<i>so I wasn't really involved</i>

674
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,016
<i>in much of the shenanigans</i>
<i>that took place.</i>

675
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:53,012
But there were parties
that I heard about.

676
00:26:53,014 --> 00:26:55,023
I may have attended one.

677
00:26:56,001 --> 00:26:57,019
<i>The Action Park</i>
<i>employee parties</i>

678
00:26:57,021 --> 00:27:00,015
<i>became the stuff</i>
<i>of New Jersey legend.</i>

679
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:03,017
<i>- We would save</i>
<i>all the money we found</i>

680
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:06,002
<i>in the pools over the course</i>
<i>of the summer,</i>

681
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,017
<i>and at the end of the summer,</i>

682
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,015
one huge all-night bash
right up in Water World

683
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:13,004
called
the kamanawanalea party.

684
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,022
<i>- Everyone stayed over,</i>
<i>so no one was driving,</i>

685
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,013
<i>but that was back in the days</i>

686
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:19,013
<i>when you could get away</i>
<i>with stuff like that.</i>

687
00:27:19,015 --> 00:27:22,002
<i>- You'd find anyplace</i>
<i>you could find to sleep--</i>

688
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:24,008
<i>on the mats,</i>
<i>under the umbrellas,</i>

689
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,023
on the picnic tables.

690
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:28,009
Some days, we'd wake up
after the kamanawanalea party,

691
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:29,021
we'd put our shorts on,

692
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,008
put the whistle
round our neck,

693
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,001
and find our way
to the lifeguard chair

694
00:27:33,003 --> 00:27:34,016
as soon as we could.

695
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:41,016
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>leadership comes from the top.</i>

696
00:27:41,018 --> 00:27:44,001
<i>And Action Park's</i>
<i>free-for-all atmosphere</i>

697
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:46,019
<i>was inspired by</i>
<i>Gene Mulvihill's disdain</i>

698
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:49,014
<i>for rules of any kind.</i>

699
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:51,008
<i>- We called him Uncle Gene</i>

700
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,001
because he actually did have
a lot of endearing qualities.

701
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:58,006
I mean, he was always out
and around in the park.

702
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:01,021
<i>You know, he was a very</i>
<i>personable guy to talk to.</i>

703
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:04,005
<i>- So I go in his office</i>
<i>one day for a meeting,</i>

704
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:05,022
<i>and he has a cattle prod.</i>

705
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,002
And he goes,
"Joe, I can't do this anymore."

706
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:11,007
And he takes the cattle prod.

707
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:13,016
<i>He puts it to his chest,</i>

708
00:28:13,018 --> 00:28:16,006
<i>and he hits the button,</i>
<i>and the thing goes boom!</i>

709
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:20,006
And I get so freaked out
that I'm like, "Oh, my God."

710
00:28:20,008 --> 00:28:22,012
<i>He starts laughing</i>
<i>hysterically,</i>

711
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:24,015
<i>and at that point,</i>
<i>he basically goes, like,</i>

712
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:26,017
"Don't get nervous.
It's fake."

713
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:29,006
And then he pitches me an idea.

714
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,011
<i>"Joe, the people sneak</i>
<i>on the lift.</i>

715
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:33,006
<i>"And they go on the lift</i>
<i>without tickets,</i>

716
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:35,011
<i>"and we want to make sure</i>
<i>they all have tickets.</i>

717
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:39,004

00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,015
<i>"'Hey, where's your ticket?'</i>

724
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,009
<i>"And they'll say,</i>

725

730

<i>I laughed like,</i>
<i>"Gene, that's some idea."</i>

731
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,002
While I was out of town,
I get a phone call

732
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:09,014
from the person
who runs guest services to say,

00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,012
<i>He was big and loud</i>
<i>and full of ideas.</i>

746
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:45,008
Probably 90 % of those ideas
were just so crazy

747
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,011
and off the wall
that nobody would get near him,

748
00:29:47,013 --> 00:29:50,002
and the other 10 %
were pretty close to that.

749
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:54,000
And we actually made
a lot of those ideas happen.

750
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,017
<i>Gene's rule-bending antics</i>

751
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:57,015
<i>may have been common</i>
<i>on Wall Street,</i>

752
00:29:57,017 --> 00:29:59,004
<i>but in this small town,</i>

753
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,001
<i>the locals had no idea</i>
<i>how to handle him.</i>

754
00:30:01,003 --> 00:30:03,008
<i>- Well, they obviously</i>
<i>didn't know</i>

755
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,023
<i>Gene Mulvihill's personality</i>
<i>until they got to know him.</i>

756
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:10,009
<i>But Vernon is a little bit</i>
<i>of a mixed bag.</i>

757
00:30:10,011 --> 00:30:12,021
<i>There were those who embraced</i>

758
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:15,006
someone like Gene Mulvihill
with open arms,

759
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:17,004
and there were those
who hated him

760
00:30:17,006 --> 00:30:21,008
<i>because they see him</i>
<i>as having destroyed</i>

761
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:26,017
our beautiful, bucolic, sleepy
little town with his resorts.

762
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:11,010
<i>- The man could wear a suit</i>
<i>in 90-degree heat.</i>

763
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:12,020
<i>I had no idea how he did that.</i>

764
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:14,013
He just was a--
he was a cool dude.

765
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:17,005
- I think he was
a piece of shit.

766
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:20,002
<i>Action Park's</i>
<i>growing reputation</i>

767
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,022
<i>posed an important question:</i>

768
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,022
<i>what insurance company</i>
<i>would dare cover</i>

769
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,015
<i>this creatively designed park?</i>

770
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,006
- Gene didn't believe
in the concept of insurance.

771
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:31,019
He thought if you got hurt,
you should be responsible.

772
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:33,014
He shouldn't have to pay
an insurance company.

773
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,005
However, he needed insurance
to stay in business.

774
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:38,003
It was part of the terms
of his lease.

775
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:39,019
So he had a work-around.

776
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:42,001
<i>He created</i>
<i>his own fake insurance company</i>

777
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:43,016
<i>based in the Cayman Islands.</i>

778
00:31:43,018 --> 00:31:45,004
<i>Its name?</i>

779
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:47,004
<i>The very real</i>
<i>and very legitimate-sounding</i>

780
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,019
<i>London and World Assurance.</i>

781
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:53,014
<i>- This company's documents</i>
<i>were very, very homemade.</i>

782
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:56,008
<i>They looked like they were</i>
<i>ginned up in a basement.</i>

783
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,001
The letterhead
was not official.

784
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:00,004
Might as well have been
on napkins.

785
00:32:00,006 --> 00:32:01,021
<i>Gene was,</i>
<i>if nothing else,</i>

786
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:03,012
<i>efficient with his schemes.</i>

787
00:32:03,014 --> 00:32:05,008
<i>And so his fake</i>
<i>insurance company</i>

788
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,020
<i>wasn't just used to avoid</i>
<i>paying for insurance.</i>

789
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:11,014
<i>It also became a vessel</i>
<i>for him to launder money.</i>

790
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,020
- I said,
"We can't do that."

791
00:32:13,022 --> 00:32:16,004
And he said,
"Why can't we do that?"

792
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:18,010
And I said, "Because the state
says we can't do that."

793
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:20,006
And he goes,
"Well, who the hell are they?

794
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:21,019
They can't shut us down."

795
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:24,014
And I said, "Well, actually,
yes, yes, they can."

796
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:26,008
<i>These crimes would attract</i>

797
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,019
<i>the attention of the state</i>
<i>and eventually lead</i>

798

799

801

from the Vernon Valley
Recreation Association

802

of Investigation.

804

<i>Gene Mulvihill did not appear,</i>

<i>The outcome?</i>

806
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:47,017
<i>Gene pled guilty</i>
<i>to counts of fraud,</i>

807
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:49,018
<i>theft, and conspiracy</i>

808
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,005
<i>and was ordered to give up</i>
<i>control of Action Park,</i>

<i>which was partially</i>
<i>on state land.</i>

810
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:57,015
<i>But to Gene,</i>
<i>that would not do.</i>

811
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,019
<i>So he came up</i>
<i>with yet another scheme.</i>

812
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:03,000
<i>He decided to become</i>
<i>the worst tenant he could.</i>

00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:05,016
<i>He stopped paying bills</i>
<i>and filing paperwork.</i>

814
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:08,001
<i>He basically did</i>
<i>everything he could</i>

815
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:10,020
<i>to antagonize</i>
<i>his landlord state.</i>

<i>- The SCI</i>
<i>accusing Vernon Valley</i>

817

<i>of "arrogantly violating</i>
<i>its agreement with the state</i>

<i>for the ski resort."</i>

819
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,009
<i>Vernon Valley</i>

<i>to avoid paying the state</i>

821
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,009
<i>several hundred thousand</i>

<i>The SCI probe also disclosed</i>
<i>Vernon Valley</i>

823
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:29,003
<i>created a phony</i>
<i>insurance company</i>

<i>to avoid premium payments</i>

825
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:33,000
and changed the terrain

826
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:34,016
without obtaining permission.

827
00:33:34,018 --> 00:33:36,004
<i>And it worked.</i>

828
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:38,008
<i>New Jersey got</i>
<i>so fed up with Gene</i>

829
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,006
<i>that they decided</i>
<i>to sell him the land</i>

830
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:42,018
<i>for just over $800,000</i>

831
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,001
<i>just to get him</i>
<i>off their backs.</i>

832
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:48,008
<i>Gene was free from the pesky</i>
<i>state of New Jersey.</i>

833
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,021
<i>And so Action Park continued</i>
<i>to expand and grow.</i>

834
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:54,014
<i>And anytime Gene needed cash</i>
<i>for a new ride,</i>

835
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:57,007
<i>his buddy Bob Brennan</i>
<i>was waiting in the wings</i>

836
00:33:57,009 --> 00:33:59,023
<i>to support Gene's wild ideas.</i>

837
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:02,003
- Excellence always succeeds.

838
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:03,014
When you have
an excellent facility

839
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:05,014
run by extraordinary people,

840
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:07,019
you're able to bring out
the fans,

841
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:09,017
and the facility does well.

842
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:13,023
<i>But things</i>

there were people

their shoulder.

891

six inches lower

like, hanging.

895
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,018
<i>The floor</i>
<i>of the pool below the cliff</i>

896
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,020
<i>was eventually painted white</i>
<i>to make it easier</i>

897
00:36:21,022 --> 00:36:25,008
<i>for lifeguards</i>
<i>to spot any bodies below.</i>

898
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,010
<i>And this wasn't</i>
<i>the only attraction</i>

899
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:31,022
<i>that was to feature cliffs.</i>

900
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,020
<i>The original concept</i>
<i>for Surf Hill,</i>

901
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:36,016
<i>which was basically a giant</i>
<i>Slip 'N Slide on a mountain,</i>

902
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:38,023
<i>was to have guests</i>
<i>jump off a cliff</i>

903
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,017
<i>before the mat</i>
<i>would catch them.</i>

904
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:44,005
<i>This idea was abandoned</i>
<i>due to space limitations.</i>

905
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:47,009
<i>- Staff members started</i>
<i>building up the jump</i>

906
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:49,005
<i>by sliding the mats</i>
<i>underneath,</i>

907
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:51,005
<i>making it bigger</i>
<i>and bigger and bigger,</i>

908
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:54,006
until eventually one of the
guests got seriously injured.

909
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:56,019
<i>We had been told</i>
<i>the person broke his neck.</i>

910
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:08,007
<i>Roaring Springs</i>
<i>was an expansive collection</i>

911
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:11,014
<i>of tube rides designed</i>
<i>to mimic the experience</i>

912
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:13,018
<i>of a mountain swimming hole.</i>

913
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,003
<i>- I remember this guy</i>
<i>coming up behind me.</i>

914
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:19,008
<i>He hit my tube</i>
<i>right before the tunnel,</i>

915
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,023
and I went off to the side,

916
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:24,022
and I slammed my head
into the center of this tube

917
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
that you were meant
to go through.

918
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:30,003
<i>- Some of the padding had got</i>
<i>torn away and exposed a bolt,</i>

919
00:37:30,005 --> 00:37:32,003
<i>and one of the guests</i>
<i>came down,</i>

920
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:33,021
and they basically
got impaled on the bolt,

921
00:37:33,023 --> 00:37:36,013
and it tore a nice gash
through their midsection,

922
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:39,007
and they had to be evacuated
off the ride.

923
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:41,002
<i>- Those ride attendants,</i>

924
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:44,002
<i>they spent their time</i>
<i>twisting their whistles</i>

925
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:48,011
<i>and then just going,</i>
<i>"Go, go, go."</i>

926
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:52,007
And a lot of the time,
those tubes would bunch up.

927
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:54,009
<i>And then what happens</i>
<i>when you get to the bottom</i>

928
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:56,009
<i>when you have to squeeze</i>
<i>into a particular area?</i>

929
00:37:56,011 --> 00:37:57,020
<i>People were crashing</i>
<i>into each other,</i>

930
00:37:57,022 --> 00:37:59,008
<i>slamming on top of each other.</i>

931
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,013
<i>One person would be</i>
<i>in the water.</i>

932
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:02,004
<i>The next person coming down</i>

933
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:04,001
<i>would then dunk</i>
<i>the next person and go under.</i>

934
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:06,016
And if you couldn't swim well,
yikes.

935
00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:11,010
CFS stood for
"can't fucking swim."

936
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:14,011
<i>- Security guys, lifeguards,</i>
<i>they carried Sharpies.</i>

937
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:16,005
<i>Action Park gave out</i>
<i>daily wristbands,</i>

938
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:19,020
<i>and they would write "CFS"</i>
<i>on the wristband.</i>

939
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:21,016
<i>If someone had CFS</i>
<i>on their wristband,</i>

940
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:24,000
<i>that means they probably</i>
<i>had gotten saved already</i>

941
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,015
<i>at some point in the day,</i>

942
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:28,021
<i>and it was a warning</i>
<i>to other people.</i>

943
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:30,012
<i>Like, if CFS</i>
<i>was on your wristband</i>

944
00:38:30,014 --> 00:38:32,009
<i>and you knew</i>
<i>you couldn't swim,</i>

945
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:34,013
<i>what the hell are you doing</i>
<i>jumping off a 20-foot cliff</i>

946
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,015
<i>into a deep pool of water?</i>

947
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:38,021
But people just--you know,
they thought, like,

948
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:41,000
this was some magical place
where all of a sudden,

949
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:43,011
they would have
the ability to swim.

950
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:44,021
- We should talk
about that other ride

951
00:38:44,023 --> 00:38:46,006
that's right near there,

952
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:49,000
<i>the Colorado River Ride.</i>

953
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:51,000
<i>Holy shit, dude.</i>

954
00:38:51,002 --> 00:38:54,009
I will say everybody talks
about Tarzan Swing.

955
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:57,012
Cliff Dive, Cannonball Falls,
you hear about those.

956
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:59,010
<i>Colorado River Ride</i>
<i>may have been</i>

957
00:38:59,012 --> 00:39:01,009
<i>the most underrated</i>
<i>dangerous ride.</i>

958
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:03,017
<i>- You would load in,</i>
<i>and they would just let</i>

959
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:05,022
<i>the laws of physics</i>
<i>take over from there,</i>

960
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,020
<i>which sometimes meant</i>
<i>that you would fly really fast</i>

961
00:39:08,022 --> 00:39:12,002
<i>and also sometimes meant</i>
<i>that you would get stuck</i>

962
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:13,016
<i>at certain points of the ride</i>

963
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,018
<i>that they hadn't designed</i>
<i>all that well,</i>

964
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,005
<i>and then you would get punted</i>
<i>by another tube.</i>

965
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:21,018
<i>- That thing was just</i>
<i>a fucking whiplash machine.</i>

966
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,008
<i>You're going up on the side.</i>

967
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,016
<i>Your raft is getting stuck</i>
<i>on the wall.</i>

968
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:28,003
You have to all team up
and push off the wall,

969
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:29,011
and now you're going backwards.

970
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:30,021
Like, this is clearly not--

971
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:34,006
there's no rhyme or reason
in this.

972
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:36,006
<i>The Colorado River Ride</i>

973
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:38,020
<i>actually began life</i>
<i>as a lazy-river ride.</i>

974
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:41,007
<i>But during construction,</i>
<i>Gene decided</i>

975
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:44,023
<i>he wanted a realistic</i>
<i>simulation of Class IV rapids.</i>

976
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:48,019
<i>Early test pilots reportedly</i>
<i>came out unconscious,</i>

977
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:52,005
<i>forcing him to turn down</i>
<i>the ride's intensity.</i>

978
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:56,001
<i>- There was one section</i>
<i>where tubes tended to go</i>

979
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:57,020
<i>right up an embankment,</i>

980
00:39:57,022 --> 00:40:00,003
<i>and everyone was</i>
<i>looking at it expectantly,</i>

981
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:03,003
<i>waiting for them</i>
<i>to fly over the side.</i>

982
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:07,011
<i>You would hear people</i>
<i>audibly go, "Oh... aw,"</i>

983
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:10,001
<i>when they didn't actually fall</i>
<i>to their doom.</i>

984
00:40:10,003 --> 00:40:13,001
- I mean, we're holding on,
getting slammed into stuff,

985
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:14,015
the thing's getting stuck,
we have to kind of

986
00:40:14,017 --> 00:40:16,005
stick our own legs out
and push our way off,

987
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:18,012
and then we go past
a lifeguard chair that,

988
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:21,003
you guessed it, is empty.

989
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:24,008
Nobody there
keeping an eye on anything.

990
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,003
<i>- Gene got involved during</i>
<i>the construction process,</i>

991
00:40:27,005 --> 00:40:29,011
and he said...
"Look, when you go down

992
00:40:29,013 --> 00:40:31,003
"the Colorado River in a raft,

993
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:33,009
"there's not some guy
in a lifeguard shirt

994
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:35,016
pushing your raft
down the river."

995
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,012
And I said,
"Look, Gene,

996
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:39,005
"this is not
the Colorado River.

997
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:40,015
It's a water park."

998
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:45,019
<i>- A lot of fights</i>
<i>on the Colorado River Ride</i>

999
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:47,009
<i>for the dumbest thing ever--</i>

1000
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,019
<i>you know,</i>
<i>rafts bumping into each other.</i>

1001
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:52,020
And then people would get out
and just start having at it.

1002
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:55,005
Some of the worst fights we had
were people standing

1003
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:57,020
<i>in the Colorado River Ride</i>
<i>punching each other.</i>

1004
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:59,008
<i>It was just dumb.</i>

1005
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,020
<i>You would be like,</i>
<i>"Really? Why here?"</i>

1006
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,021
- There's morons
in the pool with us,

1007
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:04,014
morons in the pool with us.

1008
00:41:04,016 --> 00:41:07,005
<i>Action Park was like</i>
<i>the movie "The Purge."</i>

1009
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,012
<i>Thousands of kids</i>
<i>with pent-up aggression</i>

1010
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:12,007
<i>and a healthy dose of alcohol</i>
<i>were given a space</i>

1011
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:15,008
<i>where they could do</i>
<i>whatever they wanted.</i>

1012
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,020
<i>- You know when you were</i>
<i>at pool parties or things</i>

1013
00:41:17,022 --> 00:41:20,002
<i>when you were a kid and there</i>
<i>was always those idiots</i>

1014
00:41:20,004 --> 00:41:22,013
who were like, "Let's jump
in the pool off the roof!

1015
00:41:22,015 --> 00:41:23,020
"No, let's get higher!

1016
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,015
Let's do
the second-story roof!"

1017
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:27,019
And you're always--you know,
you're kind of on board for it,

1018
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:29,008
but then at one point,
you're like,

1019
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,021
"Ah, I got to pull out
at this point.

1020
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:32,012
This is where it's getting
too dangerous."

1021
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:34,018
It was all those kids
in one park with no rules.

1022
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,002
There were no rules.

1023
00:41:36,004 --> 00:41:39,007
And for a lot of kids,
that was heaven.

1024
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:41,019
<i>- Action Park was basically</i>
<i>the only water park</i>

1025
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:44,005
<i>within the New York City area.</i>

1026
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:47,000
<i>And it was a place</i>
<i>that filled a void for people</i>

1027
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:48,013
<i>who weren't spending</i>

1028
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:50,001
<i>their summer vacation</i>
<i>at a beach house.</i>

1029
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:51,018
<i>They weren't going</i>
<i>to Cape Cod.</i>

1030
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,002
<i>They weren't going to Florida.</i>

1031
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:55,000
<i>They were going</i>
<i>to Action Park.</i>

1032
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:57,013
<i>And I think because of that,</i>
<i>it might've attracted</i>

1033
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:02,006
<i>a more, say,</i>
<i>working-class clientele.</i>

1034
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,019
<i>The more</i>
<i>news reports warned people</i>

1035
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:10,000
<i>about Action Park's</i>
<i>potential danger,</i>

1036
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:13,017
<i>the more adrenaline-fueled</i>
<i>teenagers flocked to it.</i>

1037
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,018
<i>It became</i>
<i>a self-fulfilling prophecy.</i>

1038
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,014
<i>In a world filled with people</i>
<i>telling you no,</i>

1039
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:24,010
<i>Action Park became known</i>
<i>as the land of yes.</i>

1040
00:42:24,012 --> 00:42:26,000
<i>- I'd work the front</i>
<i>of the lot</i>

1041
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,017
<i>to let people know</i>
<i>the lot was full.</i>

1042
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:29,016
<i>And what would happen is,</i>
<i>people would come</i>

1043
00:42:29,018 --> 00:42:31,020
<i>to try to get in the lot</i>
<i>after it was full.</i>

1044
00:42:31,022 --> 00:42:34,016
And one of the ways they would
try to get in is, they'd say,

1045
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:37,009
"Hey, I'm from New York City."

1046
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:39,011
And I don't know
what they meant by that,

1047
00:42:39,013 --> 00:42:42,000
but I think they didn't realize

1048
00:42:42,002 --> 00:42:44,015
that everyone here
was from New York City.

1049
00:42:44,017 --> 00:42:47,017
So as a 14-year-old, I'd say,
"Oh, my God.

1050
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:49,005
"Are there big buildings?

I can go there?"

1056

the best.

1057
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:06,008

a criminal element.

people that don't know
any restraint.

1064
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:24,010
<i>- Trying to start fights</i>

1067
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:32,016

1068

<i>That was the code for</i>
<i>"somebody shit in the pool."</i>

1069

00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:40,018
<i>its ambulances to Action Park</i>

1329
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,003
<i>because, you know,</i>
<i>Vernon was a small town,</i>

1330
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:45,003
<i>and we had two</i>
<i>volunteer ambulance squads,</i>

1331
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:48,018
<i>and Action Park would</i>
<i>keep them busy all day long.</i>

1332
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,016
<i>So there was a meeting,</i>
<i>and, you know, the town said,</i>

1333
00:54:50,018 --> 00:54:52,015
<i>"Look, you got to buy</i>
<i>your own ambulance."</i>

1334
00:54:52,017 --> 00:54:55,008
<i>And they did.</i>
<i>They had either one or two.</i>

1335
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,023
<i>I think at their height,</i>
<i>they might have had two.</i>

1336
00:54:58,001 --> 00:55:01,010
- My wife, she worked--
she was one of the admins.

1337
00:55:01,012 --> 00:55:04,013
One of her jobs, it took her
an entire week, 40 hours.

1338
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:07,014
She made an Excel spreadsheet
of all of the injuries

1339
00:55:07,016 --> 00:55:09,013
for one season at the park.

1340
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:13,001
<i>And it was a lot</i>
<i>of dislocated shoulders,</i>

1341
00:55:13,003 --> 00:55:15,014
<i>broken arms, wrists,</i>

1342
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:18,013
<i>slide abrasions</i>
<i>from the Alpine Slide.</i>

1343
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,004
<i>It was just a crazy,</i>
<i>crazy amount of injuries</i>

1344
00:55:21,006 --> 00:55:23,000
<i>at this place.</i>

1345
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:28,001
<i>It's impossible to say</i>

1346
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:30,021
<i>exactly how many people</i>
<i>were injured at Action Park.</i>

1347
00:55:30,023 --> 00:55:32,021
<i>The state only required</i>
<i>that they report</i>

1348
00:55:32,023 --> 00:55:34,015
<i>"serious injuries."</i>

1349
00:55:34,017 --> 00:55:36,019
<i>Of course, that left it</i>
<i>to Gene to decide</i>

1350
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:38,022
<i>what he viewed as serious,</i>

1351
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,014
<i>meaning that unless you</i>
<i>left the park in an ambulance,</i>

1352
00:55:41,016 --> 00:55:45,018
<i>it was almost certainly</i>
<i>not going to be reported.</i>

1353
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,012
- If the government
doesn't require you

1354
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:49,018
to report something,
there's no way

1355
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,014
that someone could determine

1356
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:54,020
how many injuries occurred
on a daily basis.

1357
00:55:54,022 --> 00:55:57,003
And if Gene wanted
to cover that up,

1358
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:59,011
it'd be very easy to do so.

1359
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,020
<i>Amusement parks</i>
<i>often embody their creators.</i>

1360
00:56:05,022 --> 00:56:08,015
<i>They are the personification</i>
<i>of some individual,</i>

1361
00:56:08,017 --> 00:56:10,021
<i>some auteur's worldview.</i>

1362
00:56:10,023 --> 00:56:12,018
<i>Walt Disney looked</i>
<i>at the world</i>

1363
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,006
<i>and wanted it to resemble</i>
<i>turn-of-the-century America</i>

1364
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:17,012
<i>with a hint of fantasy</i>
<i>and the Wild West.</i>

1365
00:56:17,014 --> 00:56:19,018
<i>And thus, you have Disneyland.</i>

1366
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,019
<i>Gene Mulvihill had a vision</i>
<i>of a place</i>

1367
00:56:21,021 --> 00:56:23,011
<i>where there were no rules,</i>

1368
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:27,020
<i>something between Ayn Rand</i>
<i>and "Lord of the Flies."</i>

1369
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:30,000
<i>- My father wanted</i>
<i>to give people the freedom</i>

1370
00:56:30,002 --> 00:56:32,017
<i>to control the action,</i>
<i>to control their speed.</i>

1371
00:56:32,019 --> 00:56:36,020
He loved to have fun,
and so the park reflected that.

1372
00:56:36,022 --> 00:56:39,015
<i>- The way things were done</i>
<i>in the '80s,</i>

1373
00:56:39,017 --> 00:56:43,008
<i>it seems to me,</i>
<i>created this situation.</i>

1374
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:45,021
You have this sense

1375
00:56:45,023 --> 00:56:49,001
of not being bridled

1376
00:56:49,003 --> 00:56:52,008
by a federal or state
or local government

1377
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:55,007
that's trying to keep you
from having fun.

1378
00:56:55,009 --> 00:56:58,016
<i>So Mulvihill created</i>

1379
00:56:58,018 --> 00:57:02,004
<i>a business that allowed people</i>

1380
00:57:02,006 --> 00:57:06,011
<i>to thumb their nose</i>
<i>at conventional norms</i>

1381
00:57:06,013 --> 00:57:11,013
<i>and thumb their nose at people</i>
<i>who worried about danger,</i>

1382
00:57:11,015 --> 00:57:13,010
<i>and they put themselves</i>

1383
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,016
<i>in the teeth</i>
<i>of a dangerous situation.</i>

1384
00:57:18,022 --> 00:57:21,008
<i>And while regulators</i>
<i>may have been tough</i>

1385
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,000
<i>on other amusement parks,</i>

1386
00:57:23,002 --> 00:57:24,021
<i>Gene had friends</i>
<i>in high places,</i>

1387
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,007
<i>and Action Park suffered</i>

1388
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,016
<i>virtually no fines</i>
<i>or citations.</i>

1389
00:57:28,018 --> 00:57:31,006
<i>- In the Reagan years,</i>
<i>there was this idea</i>

1390
00:57:31,008 --> 00:57:33,020
<i>that people</i>
<i>should govern themselves,</i>

1391
00:57:33,022 --> 00:57:35,020
<i>that red tape got in the way</i>
<i>of innovation,</i>

1392
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:38,002
<i>that American capitalism</i>
<i>was at its best</i>

1393
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:39,019
<i>when it was unregulated.</i>

1394
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:41,003
And it's in this environment

1395
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:44,005
that Action Park
is allowed to flourish.

1396
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:46,000
<i>It turns out</i>
<i>that Gene was friends</i>

1397
00:57:46,002 --> 00:57:48,002
<i>with future president</i>
<i>Donald Trump.</i>

1398
00:57:48,004 --> 00:57:51,003
<i>According to park employees,</i>
<i>Trump was actually very close</i>

1399
00:57:51,005 --> 00:57:53,015
<i>to investing in Action Park</i>
<i>at one point</i>

1400
00:57:53,017 --> 00:57:55,021
<i>and even dropped by the park</i>
<i>to check things out</i>

1401
00:57:55,023 --> 00:57:57,015
<i>and have a look around.</i>

1402
00:57:57,017 --> 00:58:01,004
<i>When he saw Gene's vision,</i>
<i>he realized it was too wild,</i>

1403
00:58:01,006 --> 00:58:03,015
<i>too nuts, even for him.</i>

1404
00:58:03,017 --> 00:58:07,009
<i>- Trump found Gene's vision</i>
<i>too unhinged.</i>

1405
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:09,021
Fuck yeah, dude.
Good for Gene.

1406
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:13,005
<i>So what would happen</i>
<i>if you sued Action Park?</i>

1407
00:58:13,007 --> 00:58:15,017
<i>Well, Gene would refuse</i>
<i>to settle.</i>

1408
00:58:15,019 --> 00:58:19,006
<i>He'd force you to trial</i>
<i>almost every single time,</i>

1409
00:58:19,008 --> 00:58:23,007
<i>and he'd make that trial as</i>
<i>long and painful as possible.</i>

1410
00:58:23,009 --> 00:58:26,007
- Gene's philosophy was,
"We fight every case.

1411
00:58:26,009 --> 00:58:27,016
"We don't settle it.

1412
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:29,014
We bring it all the way
to trial."

1413
00:58:29,016 --> 00:58:33,013
And we won 93 % of them.

1414
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:35,008
<i>Eventually word got around</i>

1415
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,003
<i>that he wouldn't settle,</i>
<i>and most lawyers thought it</i>

1416
00:58:37,005 --> 00:58:38,021
<i>too much trouble to even try.</i>

1417
00:58:38,023 --> 00:58:41,002
<i>Even if you went to trial</i>
<i>and won,</i>

1418
00:58:41,004 --> 00:58:42,020
<i>Gene would simply refuse</i>
<i>to pay</i>

1419
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:44,022
<i>unless you sent</i>
<i>the U.S. Marshals</i>

1420
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,017
<i>to his door to collect,</i>

1421
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:49,016
<i>something that happened</i>
<i>on more than one occasion.</i>

1422
00:58:49,018 --> 00:58:51,015
- The U.S. Marshals,
the first time they showed up,

1423
00:58:51,017 --> 00:58:54,020
they surrounded
the ticket booth.

1424
00:58:54,022 --> 00:58:57,012
I found my way
to them pretty quickly

1425
00:58:57,014 --> 00:59:01,006
and asked them
to please not shoot me.

1426
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:03,002
After the first time,
they would just come

1427
00:59:03,004 --> 00:59:05,013
and knock on my office and say,
"Yeah, we're here."

1428
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:07,023
Then we'd go
to the general manager's office

1429
00:59:08,001 --> 00:59:10,019
and take care of it.

01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:15,010
and then on the way--
I hate to say this--

1699
01:11:15,012 --> 01:11:20,005
but on the way back
to the hospital...

1700
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:22,012
we were--walked
across the street,

1701
01:11:22,014 --> 01:11:26,006
and I deliberately walked out
in front of a truck.

1702
01:11:26,008 --> 01:11:29,020
And at that point,
my husband pulled me back,

1703
01:11:29,022 --> 01:11:33,001
and he just screamed at me,
"What are you thinking?"

1704

I was thinking I couldn't live
