00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,842
My name is H.I. McDunnough.

3
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:28,432
Call me Hi.

4
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,103
The first time I met Ed...

5
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,773
was in the county lockup in Tempe, Arizona.

6
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,445
Don't forget his profile, Ed.

7
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:39,655
Turn to the right!

8
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:41,407
The day I'll never forget.

9
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:44,244
Turn to the right!

10
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:47,165
What kind of name is Ed
for a pretty thing like you?

11
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,167
Short for Edwina. Turn to the right!

12
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:50,962
You're a flower, you are.

13
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:54,508
Just a little desert flower.

14
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:57,846
Let me know how those come out.

15
00:00:58,764 --> 00:01:01,183
Prison life is very structured...

16
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:03,854
more than most people care for...

17
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:06,733
but there's a spirit of
camaraderie between the men...

18
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,404
like you find only in combat, maybe...

19
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:12,867
or on a pro ball club in the
heat of the pennant drive.

20
00:01:14,577 --> 00:01:16,537
In an effort to better ourselves...

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,457
we were forced to meet with a counselor...

22
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:22,796
who tried to help us figure out
why we were the way we were.

23
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:25,926
All he wanted was a hot roll and butter.

24
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:27,636
So...

25
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:30,182
why do you use the word "trapped"?

26
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,981
Why do you say you feel trapped in a man's body?

27
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:40,612
Well, sometimes I get the
menstrual cramps real hard.

28
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:42,781
Have you learned anything, Hi?

29
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,367
Yes, sir. You bet.

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,496
You wouldn't lie to us, would you?

31
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:49,082
No, ma'am. Hope to say.

32
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:50,375
OK, then.

33
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:53,755
I tried to stand up and fly straight...

34
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:57,218
but it wasn't easy with
Reagan in the White House.

35
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:00,431
I don't know.

36
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:04,019
They say he's a decent man, so...

37
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:07,440
maybe his advisers are confused.

38
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:12,405
Turn to the right.

39
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,785
What's the matter, Ed?

40
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:19,624
My "fy- ance" left me.

41
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,209
She said her fiance had run off...

42
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:22,836
with a student cosmetologist...

43
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,131
who knew how to ply her feminine wiles.

44
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,801
The sumbitch.

45
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,678
Don't forget his phone call, Ed.

46
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,351
Tell him I think he's a damn fool, Ed.

47
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:37,856
You tell him I said so...

48
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,734
H.I. McDunnough.

49
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,738
If he wants to discuss it,
he knows where to find me...

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,907
in the Maricopa County Maximum Security...

51
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,493
Correctional Facility For Men...

52
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,080
State Farm Road Number
Thirty-one, Tempe, Arizona!

53
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:50,331
I'll be waitin'!

54
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,127
I'll be waitin'.

55
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:59,010
I can't say I was happy to be back inside...

56
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:02,973
but the flood of familiar
sights, sounds, and faces...

57
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,394
almost made it feel like a homecoming.

58
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:08,690
Most men your age are
getting married and raising a family.

59
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:09,941
Well, factually...

60
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:12,028
They wouldn't accept prison as a substitute.

61
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:14,781
Would any of you men care to comment?

62
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:19,496
sometimes your career has
got to come before family.

63
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:22,082
Work's what's kept us happy.

64
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,921
I tried to sort through what
Doc Schwartz had said...

65
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:28,968
but prison ain't the easiest place to think.

66
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,263
When there was no meat, we ate fowl.

67
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:35,309
When there was no fowl, we ate crawdad.

68
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:38,897
When there was no crawdad
to be found, we ate sand.

69
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:41,692
- You ate what?
- We ate sand.

70
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:44,655
- You ate sand?
- That's right.

71
00:03:44,697 --> 00:03:46,824
Well, Hi, you done served your twenty months...

72
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,286
and seeing as how you never use live ammo...

73
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:52,415
we got no choice but to return you to society.

74
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,793
These doors gonna swing wide.

75
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:57,714
I didn't want to hurt anyone, sir.

76
00:03:57,757 --> 00:03:59,217
Hi, we respect that.

77
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:00,677
But you're just hurting yourself...

78
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,638
with this rambunctious behavior.

79
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,640
I know that, sir.

80
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:05,976
OK, then.

81
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:07,478
I don't know how you come down...

82
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,439
on the incarceration question...

83
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:12,651
whether it's for rehabilitation or revenge...

84
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,486
but I was beginning to think...

85
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,324
revenge is the only argument makes any sense.

86
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:21,664
Show the tattoo!

87
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:24,334
Turn to the right!

88
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:25,878
Don't forget his fingers, Ed.

89
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:28,839
Hear about the paddy wagon...

90
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,259
that collided with the cement mixer, Ed?

91
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:34,681
Twelve hardened criminals escaped.

92
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:37,810
Ha ha! I heard that one.

93
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,187
Got a new beau?

94
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,023
No, Hi. I sure don't.

95
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:45,195
Don't worry. I paid for it.

96
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:48,199
They say that absence makes
the heart grow fonder.

97
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,621
And for once, they may be right.

98
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:53,707
- You missed a spot.
- Rrr!

99
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:56,961
More and more, my thoughts turned to Ed...

100
00:04:57,003 --> 00:05:00,674
and I finally felt the pain of imprisonment.

101
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,302
Mama would throw the live crawdad...

102
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,014
in a pan of boiling water.

103
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:08,310
One day, I decided to make my own crawdad...

104
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:12,732
and I threw it in a pot without
the water, you see?

105
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,861
And it was just like making popcorn.

106
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:18,407
Yeah, the joint is a lonely place...

107
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,868
after lockup and lights out...

108
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:22,037
when the last of the cons...

109
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,624
has been swept away by the sandman.

110
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:26,835
But I couldn't help thinking...

111
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:29,046
that a brighter future lay ahead...

112
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:34,386
a future that was only eight
to fourteen months away.

113
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:42,690
They got a name for people like you, Hi.

114
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:45,360
That name is called recidivism.

115
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:47,279
Repeat offender.

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,366
Not a pretty name, is it, Hi?

117
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:51,535
No, sir. That's one bonehead name...

118
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:52,870
but that ain't me anymore.

119
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:55,582
You're not just telling us what we want to hear?

120
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:57,376
No, sir. No way.

121
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,587
'Cause we just want to hear the truth.

122
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,842
Then I guess I am telling
you what you want to hear.

123
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,387
Didn't we just tell you not to do that?

124
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,056
Yes, sir.

125
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,433
OK, then.

126
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,436
Turn to the right!

127
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,523
I'm walking in here on my knees, Ed...

128
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,067
a free man proposing.

129
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,485
Howdy, Kurt.

130
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:17,945
And so it was.

131
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:19,948
Don't forget the bouquet, Ed.

132
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:22,034
I do.

133
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:23,328
You bet I do.

134
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,038
OK, then.

135
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:31,213
Ed's pa staked us to a starter home...

136
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:32,591
in suburban Tempe...

137
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,595
and I got a job drilling holes in sheet metal.

138
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:37,556
We were doing paramedical work...

139
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,642
in affiliation with the state highway system.

140
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,853
Not actually practicing, you understand.

141
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:44,440
Me and Bill were patrolling down Nine Mile.

142
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:47,277
- Bill Roberts?
- No, not that mother- scratcher.

143
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,446
Bill Parker.

144
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,742
Anyway, we're approaching the wreck...

145
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:53,578
and there's this spherical object...

146
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:55,955
resting in the highway...

147
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,042
and it's not a piece of the car.

148
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,962
Most ways, the job was a lot like prison...

149
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,592
except Ed was waiting at the end of every day...

150
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,636
and a paycheck at the end of every week.

151
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,098
Government do take a bite, don't she?

152
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:12,352
These were the happy days...

153
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:15,148
the salad days, as they say.

154
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,111
Ed felt that having a critter
was the next logical step.

155
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:21,991
It was all she thought about.

156
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,870
Her point was that there was
too much love and beauty...

157
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,165
for just the two of us...

158
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,584
and every day we kept a child out of the world...

159
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:32,379
was a day he might later regret having missed.

160
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,219
That was beautiful.

161
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,016
So we worked at it on the days we
calculated most likely to be fruitful...

162
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:45,022
and we worked at it most
other days, just to be sure.

163
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:48,860
Ed rejoiced that my lawless
years were behind me...

164
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,946
and that our child- rearing years lay ahead.

165
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:53,742
And then the roof caved in.

166
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,335
Hi...

167
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:03,756
I'm barren!

168
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,968
At first I didn't believe it...

169
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,221
that this woman who looked as fertile...

170
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:10,890
as the Tennessee Valley...

171
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,267
could not bear children.

172
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,479
But the doctor explained that her insides...

173
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:19,235
were a rocky place where
my seed could find no purchase.

174
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,740
Ed was inconsolable.

175
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,454
We tried an adoption agency.

176
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:32,127
It's true that Hi has had a checkered past.

177
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,423
But Ed here is an officer
of the law twice decorated...

178
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:37,759
so we figure it kind of evens out.

179
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,018
But biology and the prejudices of others...

180
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,937
conspired to keep us childless.

181
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,445
Our love for each other was stronger than ever...

182
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:56,743
but I premonised no return of the salad days.

183
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,915
The pizzazz had gone out of our lives.

184
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,962
Ed lost all interest in both criminal justice...

185
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:06,966
and housekeeping.

186
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:10,763
Soon after, she tendered her badge.

187
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:13,975
Even my job seemed as dry and bitter...

188
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:15,978
as a hot prairie wind.

189
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,732
So here's Bill walking down Nine Mile...

190
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,734
That's Bill Parker, you understand.

191
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:23,739
He's got his sandwich in one hand...

192
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:26,200
and the fuckin' head in the other!

193
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:32,250
I even caught myself driving
by convenience stores...

194
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:35,546
that weren't on the way home.

195
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:38,968
Then, one day...

196
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:42,931
the biggest news hit the state
since they built the Hoover Dam.

197
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:47,354
The Arizona Quints was born.

198
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:51,400
By Arizona Quints...

199
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:56,073
I mean they was born to a
woman named Florence Arizona.

200
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:57,618
As you probably guessed...

201
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,123
Florence Arizona is the wife of Nathan Arizona...

202
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,042
and Nathan Arizona...

203
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,838
well, hell, you know who he is.

204
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:10,302
So come on down to Unpainted Arizona...

205
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,804
where you can get the finest selection...

206
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:13,723
in fixtures and appointments...

207
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:16,393
for your bathroom, bedroom, boudoir!

208
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:19,272
And if you can find lower prices anywhere...

209
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:21,817
my name ain't Nathan Arizona!

210
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:24,529
The owner of the largest
chain of unpainted furniture...

211
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:29,077
and bathroom fixture outlets
throughout the Southwest.

212
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:32,498
Yep, Florence had been taking fertility pills...

213
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,751
and she and Nathan had hit the jackpot.

214
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:42,178
Now, y'all without sin
can cast the first stone...

215
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:46,142
but we thought it was unfair
that some should have so many...

216
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:48,395
while others should have so few.

217
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:52,316
With the benefit of hindsight...

218
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,486
maybe it wasn't such a hot idea.

219
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,283
But at the time...

220
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,369
Ed's little plan seemed like the solution...

221
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,538
to all our problems...

222
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:05,668
and the answer to all our prayers.

223
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:42,259
Eight hundred leaf- tables and no chairs?

224
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,929
You can't sell leaf- tables and no chairs.

225
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,351
Chairs, you got a dinette set.
No chairs, you got dick!

226
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:50,312
I asked my wife. She got more sense.

227
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:54,067
Miles, alls I know is...

228
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:56,654
I'm away from the office to play with my kids...

229
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,740
and everything goes straight to heck!

230
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:00,450
I ain't gonna stand for it!

231
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:04,956
Yeah, if a frog had wings,
it wouldn't bump its ass a- hoppin'.

232
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,544
I am sick of your excuses, Miles.

233
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,422
It is now precisely...

234
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:13,635
8:45 in the p.m.

235
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:16,222
I'm gonna be down at that
store in exactly twelve hours...

236
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,433
to kick me some butt...

237
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:20,435
or my name ain't Nathan Arizona!

238
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:27,070
That sounds like Larry.

239
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:30,074
No, no, no. Shh. Shh.

240
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,205
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

241
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,503
Quiet, quiet.

242
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:42,465
Quiet.

243
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:43,801
Good boy.

244
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:49,934
Quiet, quiet.

245
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,820
That's it. Good, good.

246
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:00,866
Quiet.

247
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:06,624
Yes.

248
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,304
Here's a rattle.

249
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:18,682
Rattle. OK?

250
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:20,100
OK, good.

251
00:13:35,872 --> 00:13:37,290
No, no.

252
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:39,835
Shh. Shh. Quiet, quiet.

253
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,398
Come here.

254
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,098
Come here. Come here.

255
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:34,198
Why don't you go up and check on them?

256
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,408
They sound restless.

257
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:21,429
What's the matter?

258
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,640
I'm sorry, honey. It just didn't work out.

259
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,225
What do you mean it didn't work out?

260
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:29,105
They...they started crying.

261
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:30,816
They were all over me.

262
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:32,902
It was kind of horrifying, honey. Let me in.

263
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,238
Of course they cried. Babies cry.

264
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,284
I know that. We better leave.

265
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,035
You go right back up there and get me a toddler.

266
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,915
I need a baby, Hi. They got
more than they can handle.

267
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:43,083
Oh, honey...

268
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,501
Don't you come back here without a baby.

269
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,168
Christian Dior, my butt.

270
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,339
They pay money for that?

271
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,549
Yes, dear.

272
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:22,052
How are the kids?

273
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:23,721
Fine, dear.

274
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:30,021
- Which one you get?
- I don't know.

275
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:31,731
- Nathan Junior, I think.
- Give me here.

276
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:33,484
Here's the instructions.

277
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:36,030
Oh...

278
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:37,907
he's beautiful.

279
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:39,492
Yep. He's awful damn good.

280
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:41,245
I think I got the best one.

281
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:42,496
I bet they were all beautiful.

282
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,041
All babies are beautiful.

283
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:46,335
This one's awful damn good, though.

284
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:47,837
Don't you cuss around him.

285
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:50,340
He's fine, he is.

286
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:51,926
I think it's Nathan Junior.

287
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:53,720
We are doing the right thing, aren't we, Hi?

288
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:55,514
They had more than they could handle.

289
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:58,268
Well, now, honey, we've been
over this and over this.

290
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,396
There's what's right and there's what's right...

291
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:01,564
and never the twain shall meet.

292
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:03,441
But don't you think his mama will be upset...

293
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:05,152
I mean, overly?

294
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:08,782
Of course she'll be upset,
sugar, but she'll get over it.

295
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:10,993
She's got four little babies...

296
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:12,871
almost as good as this one.

297
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:15,374
It's like when I was robbing convenience stores.

298
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:19,045
I love him so much!

299
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,218
I know you do, honey.

300
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,222
I love him so much!

301
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,018
I know you do.

302
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:44,914
Oh!

303
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:56,221
OK. Bring him in.

304
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:59,434
This is it, Nathan Junior.

305
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:01,353
Feast your eyes, old boy!

306
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:03,022
Don't be so loud around him.

307
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:05,317
- Damn. I'm sorry, honey.
- And don't you cuss.

308
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,403
He don't know a cuss word from Shinola.

309
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,572
Well, you see that he don't.

310
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,866
I want to hold him, too.

311
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:13,161
Well, mind his little fontanel.

312
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:15,122
Oh, he's all right, he is.

313
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:17,458
Come on over here, young Nathan Junior.

314
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,210
I'm gonna show you around.

315
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,422
Looky here, young sportsman.

316
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:24,342
That there's the kitchen area
where Ma and Pa chow down.

317
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:26,846
This here's the TV.

318
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,598
Two hours a day, maximum...

319
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:30,685
either educational or football...

320
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:33,814
so's you don't ruin your
appreciation of the finer things.

321
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,360
And this here's the divan...

322
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:39,780
for socializing and relaxing
with the family unit.

323
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:42,492
Yes, sir.

324
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:45,287
Many's the day we sat there and said...

325
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,418
"Wouldn't it be nice to have a youngster
here to share our thoughts and feelings?"

326
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,462
He's tired, Hi.

327
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:53,716
Well, I'll just set you right there, boy.

328
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:56,803
Just put those dogs up and take a load off.

329
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:24,257
What? Are you kidding? We got us a family here!

330
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:28,554
He's a scandal, isn't he? He's a little outlaw.

331
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:30,599
No. He...he's a good boy.

332
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:31,767
He ain't too good.

333
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:33,895
You can tell by that twinkle in his eye.

334
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:36,106
Don't you think we ought to put him to bed?

335
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:37,483
No. Hang on, honey.

336
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:39,903
Let's preserve the moment in pictures.

337
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:41,196
Just one, OK?

338
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,617
I got to tell you...

339
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,454
I'm a little scared, Hi.

340
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,456
How come is that, honey?

341
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,167
Well, we got a baby, Hi.

342
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,921
It's an awful big responsibility.

343
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,715
Honey, could you slide over a tad...

344
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:56,092
and raise the nipper up?

345
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:59,138
I mean, we never done this before...

346
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,515
and I'm kind of nervous.

347
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,932
You're doing real good, sugar.

348
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,903
- I love you, Hi.
- We're set to pop here, honey.

349
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:13,657
- You're gonna help, aren't you?
- How's that, honey?

350
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:15,702
Contribute...

351
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:17,454
to the management of the child.

352
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:20,625
Quiet evenings at home together.

353
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:24,797
- You can count on it, honey.
- Everything decent and normal.

354
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,132
We're set to pop here, honey.

355
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:57,089
OK.

356
00:22:57,131 --> 00:22:58,591
What is she?

357
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,260
Station wagon. Looks nice.

358
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,303
- Merry Christmas.
- Open up! It's the police!

359
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:33,471
What's going on?

360
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:35,140
- Stay in here.
- Open up!

361
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:37,477
They ain't gonna split up the family.

362
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,938
Open up in there!

363
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,189
I'd like to see them try.

364
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:47,198
Open up! Maybe we'll let you plea- bargain!

365
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,209
Oh, Gale! Oh, make me sick!

366
00:23:58,547 --> 00:24:01,676
Honey, I'd like you to meet...

367
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:04,304
Gale and Evelle Snoats...

368
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:07,726
as fine a pair as ever broke and entered!

369
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:14,360
Boys...this here's my wife.

370
00:24:15,445 --> 00:24:17,155
- Ma'am.
- Miz McDunnough.

371
00:24:17,197 --> 00:24:20,910
Kind of late for visitors, isn't it, Hi?

372
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:23,706
Yeah, but these boys just got out of the joint...

373
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:26,710
so we got to show a little hospitality.

374
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:31,049
H.I., looks like you been up
to the devil's business.

375
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:34,387
Is that a him or a her?

376
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,056
It's a little boy.

377
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,728
Got a name, does he?

378
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,064
So far, we just been using Junior.

379
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,733
We call him Junior.

380
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,403
You mean J.R., just like the TV show?

381
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:52,244
That's good!

382
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:55,416
"Welcome home, son." Where's he been?

383
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,961
- Phoenix.
- Tulsa.

384
00:24:58,003 --> 00:25:00,923
He was visiting his grandparents.

385
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:02,132
They're separated.

386
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,927
Would that be your folks, ma'am?

387
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,137
No. I'm afraid not.

388
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:08,224
You said your folks was dead, H.I.

389
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:12,605
We thought Junior should
see their final resting place.

390
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:14,274
Why don't you boys have a seat?

391
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:21,408
Hi, it's 2:00 in the morning.

392
00:25:23,203 --> 00:25:24,412
What's that smell?

393
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:28,210
We don't always smell this way, Miz McDunnough.

394
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:30,254
I was just explaining to your better half here...

395
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,006
that when we were tunneling out...

396
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:33,509
we happened to hit the main sewer line...

397
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:36,054
dumb luck that... and we followed that...

398
00:25:36,096 --> 00:25:38,474
You mean you busted out of jail?

399
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:41,603
We released ourselves on our own recognizance.

400
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:44,732
What Evelle's saying
is we felt the institution...

401
00:25:44,774 --> 00:25:46,818
no longer had anything to offer us.

402
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,236
My Lord, he's cute!

403
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,365
He's a little outlaw. You can see that, Hi.

404
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:52,534
Now, listen. You folks can't stay here.

405
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:55,038
Ma'am?

406
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,373
You just can't stay.

407
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:58,459
I appreciate your being friends of Hi...

408
00:25:58,543 --> 00:26:00,629
but this is a decent family now.

409
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:02,131
We got a toddler here.

410
00:26:05,886 --> 00:26:08,514
Say, who wears the pants around here, H.I.?

411
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:12,060
Ha! Honey, these boys
just got out of the joint...

412
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,605
Don't "honey" me.

413
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:15,607
You can set a while and catch up...

414
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,151
but then be on your way.

415
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:30,794
Got you on an awful short leash, don't she?

416
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:51,281
Are they still here?

417
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:53,909
Yeah.

418
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:57,956
They're just gonna stay a day or two, honey.

419
00:26:57,998 --> 00:27:01,043
It's raining out. They got nowheres to go.

420
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:03,254
They're fugitives, Hi.

421
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:06,301
How are we gonna start a
new life with them around?

422
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:09,930
Well, honey, you got to have a little charity.

423
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:14,854
You know, in Arab lands, you set out a plate.

424
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:16,564
Promise, just a day or two.

425
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:20,404
Tonight and tomorrow, tops.

426
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,453
That night, I had a dream.

427
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:28,748
I drifted off...

428
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,711
thinking about happiness, birth, and new life...

429
00:27:34,464 --> 00:27:36,591
but now I was haunted by a vision of...

430
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:41,932
He was horrible.

431
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:46,814
The lone biker of the apocalypse.

432
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,362
A man with all the powers of hell at his command.

433
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:55,242
He could turn the day into night...

434
00:27:57,036 --> 00:27:59,372
and laid to waste everything in his path.

435
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:07,425
He was especially hard on the little things...

436
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:09,720
the helpless and the gentle creatures.

437
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,225
He left a scorched earth in his wake...

438
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:15,853
befouling even the sweet desert breeze...

439
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,605
that whipped across his brow.

440
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:22,946
I didn't know where he came from or why.

441
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:29,204
I didn't know if he was... a dream or vision...

442
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:32,292
but I feared that I myself had unleashed him.

443
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,345
For he was the fury that would be...

444
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:44,809
as soon as Florence Arizona
found her little Nathan gone.

445
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:26,032
Is he all right?

446
00:29:26,074 --> 00:29:27,409
He's all right.

447
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,577
He was just having a nightmare.

448
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:53,610
Sometimes it's a hard world
for the little things.

449
00:30:00,328 --> 00:30:04,124
No, the missis and the rest of the kids...

450
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:07,796
left town to... I ain't sayin' where.

451
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:10,633
They'll be back here when
we're a nuclear family again.

452
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,802
Which tot was abducted?

453
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,722
Nathan Junior, I think.

454
00:30:14,764 --> 00:30:17,267
Do you have anything to say to the kidnappers?

455
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:18,811
Watch your butts.

456
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:22,065
It's been rumored your son was abducted by UFOs.

457
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:24,068
Don't print that, son.

458
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,073
If his mama reads that, she'll lose all hope.

459
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:31,035
We need to ask you some more questions.

460
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:35,459
But remember, it's still business
as usual at Unpainted Arizona.

461
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,169
If you can find lower prices anywhere...

462
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,088
my name still ain't Nathan Arizona.

463
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:41,050
But, sir...

464
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,813
Mr. Byrum can take your exemplars while you talk.

465
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:53,024
Just relax your hand. I'll do the work.

466
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:55,068
What is this? I didn't steal the damn kid.

467
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:56,863
These men are with the FBI.

468
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:58,073
Are you boys crazy?

469
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:00,576
Alls I know is I wake up
and my wife is screaming.

470
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:04,873
We need to distinguish your prints
from the perpetrator, if they left any.

471
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,043
Of course. I know that.

472
00:31:07,085 --> 00:31:08,795
We have an indication...

473
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:10,297
you were born Nathan Huffheinz.

474
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,466
Is this correct?

475
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:12,884
I changed my name. What of it?

476
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:14,761
Can you give us an indication why?

477
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:16,263
Yeah. Would you buy furniture...

478
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:19,017
at a store called Unpainted Huffheinz?

479
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,271
Was the child wearing anything
when he was abducted?

480
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,856
Nobody sleeps naked in this house.

481
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:24,525
I am asking the questions.

482
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:26,569
To put out an APB, I need a description.

483
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:29,949
We're better trained
to intervene in a crisis situation.

484
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,117
What was he wearing?

485
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:32,368
A dinner jacket. What do you think?

486
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:33,746
He was wearing his damn jammies.

487
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:35,915
The child was wearing his jammies.

488
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,501
Do you have any disgruntled employees?

489
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:38,669
They're all disgruntled.

490
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:40,630
I ain't running a damn daisy farm.

491
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:42,758
My motto is "Do it my way or watch your butt."

492
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,927
It might have been an employee?

493
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,847
Don't make me laugh. Without my say- so...

494
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:48,599
they wouldn't piss with their pants on fire.

495
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:49,934
What did the pajamas look like?

496
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,187
I don't know. They were jammies!

497
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,149
They had Yodas and shit on 'em!

498
00:31:55,317 --> 00:31:57,444
Get your damn feet off my coffee table!

499
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:58,780
Ron, you are upsetting the victim.

500
00:31:58,822 --> 00:32:01,241
Are you boys gonna chase down your leads...

501
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:03,911
or sit around drinking coffee in the one house...

502
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:06,248
in the state where I know my boy ain't at?

503
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,460
We don't have any leads aside from the coat.

504
00:32:09,503 --> 00:32:12,173
Give me that! That's a $500 camel's hair coat!

505
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:15,678
Sir, you might want to wash your hands.

506
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,641
God damn it!

507
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:24,147
No leads? Everyone leaves microbes and whatnot.

508
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:25,899
That's your forte, ain't it?

509
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:29,321
Trackin' down microbes left
by criminals and commies.

510
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:31,782
That's your whole goddamned
raison d'etre, ain't it?

511
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,995
No leads? I want Nathan Junior back...

512
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,956
or whichever the hell one of 'em they took!

513
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:41,170
He's out there somewhere. Something leads to him.

514
00:32:41,212 --> 00:32:45,509
And anyone can find him knows the difference
between a lead and a hole in the ground!

515
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,267
Awful good cereal flakes, Miz McDunnough.

516
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,239
Why ain't you breast- feedin'?

517
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,161
You appear to be capable.

518
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:09,415
Mind your own business.

519
00:34:09,457 --> 00:34:11,084
Ma'am, you don't breast- feed him...

520
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:12,794
he'll hate you for it later.

521
00:34:12,836 --> 00:34:14,630
That's why we wound up in prison.

522
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:17,258
That's what Doc Schwartz says.

523
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:18,469
Boys.

524
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:22,140
Mornin', Hi.

525
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,148
Hi.

526
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:36,576
Uh...say, boys...

527
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:41,500
you wouldn't mind making yourself scarce for a
couple of hours this afternoon, would you?

528
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:43,628
We're having some decent friends over.

529
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:49,552
What Ed means to say is...

530
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:54,851
seein' as you two boys are wanted...

531
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,688
wouldn't exactly do to
have folks seein' you here.

532
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,066
It's for your own protection.

533
00:35:00,818 --> 00:35:02,862
Sure, H.I.

534
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:05,198
Anything you say, Hi.

535
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:09,538
Honey, I think I'll skip this
get- together myself.

536
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,375
Glen won't mind. I'll duck out with the boys...

537
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,377
knock back a couple of Coca- Colas.

538
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,714
Sure, H.I.

539
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:18,550
We'd love to have you, Hi.

540
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,559
Maybe that ain't such a swell idea, either.

541
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:32,110
So many social engagements...

542
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:35,072
so little time.

543
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,671
Where's that baby Where's he at?

544
00:35:46,672 --> 00:35:48,799
Go find him, honey!

545
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:50,009
Cut it out, Glen!

546
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:52,053
He's asleep right now.

547
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:54,307
Shit! I hope we didn't wake it.

548
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:56,309
Can I sneak a peek- a- loo?

549
00:35:57,686 --> 00:35:59,438
Come on, kids!

550
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:01,358
Get away from Mr. McDunnough's car!

551
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:10,161
What's his name?

552
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:14,875
Uh, Hi...Junior...

553
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,920
till we think of a better one.

554
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:18,548
Well, why don't you call him Jason?

555
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,051
I just love biblical names.
If I had another little boy...

556
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:22,719
I'd name him Jason, Caleb, or Tab.

557
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:25,140
Oh, he's an angel!

558
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:27,727
He's an angel straight from heaven!

559
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,105
Honey, I had my kids the hard way.

560
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,732
Tell me how you got this little angel?

561
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:34,861
Did he fly straight down from heaven?

562
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,406
You're gonna send him to Arizona State.

563
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:48,547
Need a beer, Glen?

564
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:50,716
Does the Pope wear a funny hat?

565
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:53,845
Yeah, I guess it is kind of funny.

566
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:56,306
Say, that reminds me.

567
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:59,186
How many Polacks it take
to screw up a light bulb?

568
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:01,376
I don't know. One?

569
00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:03,525
Nope, it takes three.

570
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:12,329
Wait a minute. No, I told it wrong.

571
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:13,497
Here, I'm starting again.

572
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:15,917
How come it takes three Polacks
to screw up a light bulb?

573
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,419
I don't know, Glen.

574
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,255
'Cause they're so darn stupid!

575
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:25,304
Shit, man, listen up. Don't you get it?

576
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:30,103
No, Glen, I sure don't.

577
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:33,232
I guess that's why they call it a way- homer.

578
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:34,400
Why?

579
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:36,069
You only get it on the way home.

580
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:38,405
I'm already home, Glen.

581
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:41,535
You wet yourself! You wet yourself!

582
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:44,873
Mr. McDunnough wet himself, Daddy!

583
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:47,835
Say, how'd you get that kid so darn fast?

584
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:49,170
Me and Dot went in to adopt...

585
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:50,797
on account of something went wrong with my semen.

586
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,343
They said we had to wait five
years for a healthy, white baby.

587
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:57,348
I said, "Five years? OK, what else you got?"

588
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,891
They said they got two Koreans...

589
00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:02,480
and a Negro born with his heart on the outside.

590
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:04,149
It's a crazy world.

591
00:38:04,191 --> 00:38:05,651
Someone ought to sell tickets.

592
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:07,028
Sure, I'd buy one.

593
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:11,325
That Buford's a sly one.

594
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:13,411
He already knows his ABCs.

595
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:14,579
Watch this.

596
00:38:14,622 --> 00:38:15,957
Hit the deck, boy!

597
00:38:19,044 --> 00:38:21,046
But like I'm sayin', how'd you get the kid?

598
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:27,013
This whole thing is just who knows who.

599
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,266
Then over here you have favoritism.

600
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,727
Ed has a friend at one of the agencies.

601
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:33,438
Maybe she can do something for me and Dot.

602
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:35,003
There's something wrong with my semen.

603
00:38:35,004 --> 00:38:36,526
That reminds me, what you gonna name it?

604
00:38:38,028 --> 00:38:40,447
Ed. Ed Junior.

605
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,950
But I thought you said it was a boy.

606
00:38:41,992 --> 00:38:45,037
As in "Edward." We just like that name.

607
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,518
Yeah, that's a good one.

608
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,958
I don't need another kid...

609
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,253
but Dot says these are getting too big to cuddle.

610
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,005
Say, that reminds me...

611
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:56,470
Mind you don't cut yourself, Mordecai.

612
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:01,059
Then there's the diphtheria- tetanus.

613
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:03,103
Get them dip- tet boosters yearly...

614
00:39:03,146 --> 00:39:05,106
or else they'll develop lockjaw and night vision.

615
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:07,652
Then there's the smallpox vaccine...

616
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,236
chicken pox, and measles.

617
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:10,488
If your kid's anything like ours...

618
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:12,033
you'll have to get those shots yourself first...

619
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:13,701
before he'll ever take them.

620
00:39:13,743 --> 00:39:15,703
Who's your pediatrician, anyway?

621
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:19,250
We ain't exactly fixed on one yet, have we, Hi?

622
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:23,464
No, I guess we don't have one yet.

623
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:26,344
Jesus! You got to have one this instant!

624
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:28,429
What if the baby gets sick, honey?

625
00:39:28,472 --> 00:39:30,599
Even if he don't get sick,
he's got to have his dip- tet.

626
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,184
He's got to have his dip- tet, honey.

627
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,313
Have you started his bank accounts yet?

628
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:37,650
Have we done that? We got to do that, honey.

629
00:39:37,651 --> 00:39:38,777
What's that for?

630
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:41,321
His orthodontia and his university.

631
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:44,118
Soak his thumb in iodine you
might get by without orthodontia.

632
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,578
Won't knock a thing off the university.

633
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:48,874
Ray, take that diaper off your head!

634
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:51,419
Put it back onto your sister!

635
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:53,588
You probably got the life insurance...

636
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:55,133
all squared away.

637
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:56,509
Have we done that yet, honey?

638
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,930
Got to do that, Hi.

639
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:01,974
Ed's got her hands full with this little angel.

640
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:03,143
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:05,020
What would Ed and little angel do if a truck...

642
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:07,774
splattered your brains all over the interstate?

643
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:10,361
Yeah, honey. What if you get run over?

644
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:12,363
Or you got carried off by a twister?

645
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:18,038
Say, you hear about the
person of Polish persuasion...

646
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,417
he walks into a bar with a
big pile of shit in his hands...

647
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,422
and he says, "Look what I almost stepped in."

648
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,840
Yeah, that's funny.

649
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,176
You're damn right it's funny.

650
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,845
Shit, what's the matter?

651
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:31,682
I don't know.

652
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:36,355
Maybe it's a wife, kids, family life.

653
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:37,648
I mean...

654
00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:43,615
Are you... are you satisfied, Glen?

655
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:48,037
Don't you ever feel suffocated?

656
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,209
Like there's something big pressing down?

657
00:40:53,253 --> 00:40:56,340
Yeah, I do know that feeling.

658
00:40:56,382 --> 00:40:57,758
I don't know.

659
00:40:57,801 --> 00:40:59,887
And I told Dot to lose some weight...

660
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,763
but she don't want to listen.

661
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:05,185
Ha ha ha ha! No, man, I know what you mean.

662
00:41:05,227 --> 00:41:07,605
You got all these responsibilities now.

663
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:09,274
You're married, you got a kid.

664
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:12,111
It looks like your whole life is set down...

665
00:41:12,112 --> 00:41:13,530
and where's the excitement?

666
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,074
Yeah, that's it.

667
00:41:15,116 --> 00:41:19,287
That's a disease, but you got a cure.

668
00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:22,625
Dr. Glen is here to tell you
that you can heal thyself.

669
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:23,919
What do I got to do?

670
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:26,589
Just broaden your mind a little.

671
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:30,427
Say if I asked you, what do you think about Dot?

672
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,015
She's a fine woman you got there.

673
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:36,353
You might not know it to look at her...

674
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:40,775
but she's a hellcat. T- i- g- e- r.

675
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:42,277
What's that got to do...

676
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,154
Now, don't rush me.

677
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:47,200
The thing about Dot is...

678
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:48,911
She told me this.

679
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:53,459
She thinks... she thinks you're cute.

680
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,461
Yeah?

681
00:41:55,504 --> 00:41:56,797
I'm crappin' you negative...

682
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:59,008
and I could say the same thing about Ed.

683
00:42:01,303 --> 00:42:02,888
What are you talking about?

684
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,184
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about sex, boy.

685
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:07,561
What the hell are you talking about?

686
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:08,896
I'm talking about l'amour.

687
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:11,192
I'm talking me and Dot are swingers...

688
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:12,943
as in "to swing."

689
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:15,739
I'm talking about wife- swapping.

690
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:18,576
I'm talking about what they call open marriage.

691
00:42:18,618 --> 00:42:19,953
I'm talking about...

692
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,083
Keep your goddamn hands off my wife.

693
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:28,923
I was only trying to help!

694
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:32,512
You crazy! You're crazy, man!

695
00:42:32,554 --> 00:42:35,349
Keep your goddamn hands off my wife!

696
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,685
You're crazy! I pity you!

697
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:53,039
We finally go out with some decent people...

698
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:56,211
and you break his nose. That ain't too funny.

699
00:42:56,253 --> 00:42:58,297
His kids thought it was funny.

700
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:00,258
Well, they're just kids.

701
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,761
You're a grown man with responsibilities.

702
00:43:02,762 --> 00:43:03,929
Whatever possessed you?

703
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,309
He was provoking me.

704
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,519
How?

705
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:13,359
Never mind.

706
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:17,990
But, Hi, he's your foreman.
He's gonna fire you now.

707
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:20,744
I expect he will.

708
00:43:20,786 --> 00:43:22,204
And where does that leave the three of us?

709
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:24,373
Where does that leave our entire family unit?

710
00:43:28,922 --> 00:43:30,590
With a man for a husband.

711
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:32,426
That ain't no answer.

712
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,722
Honey, that's the only answer.

713
00:43:35,764 --> 00:43:36,890
That ain't no answer.

714
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:38,768
Just a man for a husband.

715
00:43:46,863 --> 00:43:48,615
Nathan needs some Huggies.

716
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:53,121
I'll be out directly.

717
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:01,549
Mind you stay strapped in.

718
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:08,892
Wake up, son.

719
00:44:11,438 --> 00:44:14,901
I'll be taking these Huggies and
whatever cash you got.

720
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:18,154
"No, no, not by the hair
on my chinny- chin- chin..."

721
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,032
said the little pig.

722
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,617
Look at him.

723
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,162
"Then I..."

724
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:31,047
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff...

725
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:33,258
"and I'll blow your house in."

726
00:44:34,761 --> 00:44:36,680
That sumbitch.

727
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,850
That son of a bitch.

728
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:46,485
You son of a bitch!

729
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:48,905
Hurry up. I'm in Dutch with the wife.

730
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:51,074
You son of a bitch!

731
00:44:52,952 --> 00:44:54,203
Come on, now.

732
00:44:59,503 --> 00:45:00,671
Honey?

733
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,237
That sumbitch.

734
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,827
Hold on, Nathan. We're gonna go pick up Daddy.

735
00:46:41,434 --> 00:46:44,897
Son, you got a panty on your head.

736
00:46:44,898 --> 00:46:46,524
Just drive fast.

737
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,593
Oh, wait. There's the wife.

738
00:47:05,635 --> 00:47:06,761
Honey!

739
00:47:06,803 --> 00:47:08,764
Grab the baby, now!

740
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:30,295
Hang on, Nathan. We're gonna take a shortcut.

741
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,641
Aah! Can I stop now?

742
00:47:47,611 --> 00:47:48,779
Thank you.

743
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,664
That's private property, son.

744
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,878
Come out to the street and reveal yourself.

745
00:48:11,187 --> 00:48:12,605
Son of a bitch.

746
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:40,063
Thank you, honey, but you
really didn't have to do this.

747
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:43,152
You son of a bitch! What if we'd been picked up?

748
00:49:43,193 --> 00:49:44,361
Turn left here.

749
00:49:44,403 --> 00:49:46,614
Nathan Junior would have been
accessory to armed robbery.

750
00:49:46,657 --> 00:49:49,619
It ain't armed robbery if the gun ain't loaded.

751
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:51,163
What kind of home life is this for a toddler?

752
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:52,498
You're supposed to be an example.

753
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,916
A what Businessman?

754
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:56,462
I never postured myself as a
three- piece- suit type!

755
00:49:56,504 --> 00:49:57,630
Turn right, honey.

756
00:49:57,672 --> 00:49:59,633
We got a child now. Everything's changed.

757
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:02,595
Nathan Junior accepts me for what I am...

758
00:50:02,638 --> 00:50:05,308
and I think you better had, too.

759
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,397
I'm OK, you're OK. That there's what it is.

760
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,274
I know, but, honey...

761
00:50:11,317 --> 00:50:13,194
I come from a long line of frontiersmen...

762
00:50:13,236 --> 00:50:16,866
Oh, here it is, dear. Turn here.

763
00:50:16,908 --> 00:50:18,618
I'm not gonna live this way, Hi.

764
00:50:18,661 --> 00:50:20,914
It just ain't family life!

765
00:50:20,956 --> 00:50:23,751
Well, it ain't Ozzie and Harriet.

766
00:50:49,663 --> 00:50:51,165
You two are leaving tomorrow morning.

767
00:50:51,207 --> 00:50:52,542
I got nothing against you personally...

768
00:50:52,584 --> 00:50:54,378
but you're wanted by the authorities...

769
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,923
and you're a bad influence in this household.

770
00:50:58,134 --> 00:50:59,302
Well, ma'am...

771
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:03,725
we sure didn't mean to influence anybody.

772
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:06,437
And if we did, we apologize.

773
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:08,523
I'm going in town tomorrow
to see about shots for the baby.

774
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,444
When I come back, you better be gone.

775
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:32,182
What's he need, his dip- tet?

776
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:37,732
I'm awful sorry, boys, but...when Ed gets mad...

777
00:51:37,774 --> 00:51:40,569
you know, she gets an idea.

778
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:43,198
There ain't a thing to apologize for, H.I.

779
00:51:44,158 --> 00:51:46,619
Seems pretty clear what the situation is here.

780
00:51:48,664 --> 00:51:52,502
Yeah. I guess the missis wants us to clear out.

781
00:51:52,545 --> 00:51:56,425
Now, H.I., if you'll pardon me for sayin' so...

782
00:51:57,677 --> 00:52:00,514
I get the feelin' that this
here ain't exactly workin' out.

783
00:52:00,556 --> 00:52:02,725
Edwina's generally a real sweetheart.

784
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:05,855
And as per usual, I wouldn't be surprised...

785
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:09,694
if the source of the marital
friction weren't financial.

786
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:15,411
As a matter of fact... I did lose my job today.

787
00:52:15,453 --> 00:52:20,168
Oh, Hi, you're young and got your health.

788
00:52:20,209 --> 00:52:21,919
What do you want with a job?

789
00:52:21,962 --> 00:52:24,757
I'd rather light a candle
than curse your darkness.

790
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,177
Now, as you know...

791
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:30,974
Evelle and I never go anywhere
without there's a purpose.

792
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:34,605
And here we are in your little domicile.

793
00:52:37,943 --> 00:52:40,655
We come to invite you in on a little score.

794
00:52:40,697 --> 00:52:42,658
- A bank, H.I.
- Come on, now!

795
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:47,289
I know you're partial to convenience stores...

796
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,707
but damn it, H.I...

797
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:53,173
the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocery.

798
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:54,842
It's like Doc Schwartz says.

799
00:52:54,884 --> 00:52:57,345
You got to have a little ambition.

800
00:52:57,387 --> 00:52:59,056
We just watchin' on the news...

801
00:52:59,098 --> 00:53:02,394
how somebody went and snatched
one of them Arizona babies.

802
00:53:05,566 --> 00:53:06,817
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

803
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:09,487
That's somebody who's thinking big.

804
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,991
Here you are sitting on your butt...

805
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:13,743
playing house with a...

806
00:53:13,786 --> 00:53:15,830
don't get me wrong... with a fine woman...

807
00:53:15,872 --> 00:53:19,961
but a woman who needs a button- down type.

808
00:53:20,003 --> 00:53:21,630
I don't particularly think that's any of your...

809
00:53:21,672 --> 00:53:24,384
Hold on, H.I. Now looky there.

810
00:53:25,386 --> 00:53:27,055
That's a picture of El Dorado.

811
00:53:27,097 --> 00:53:28,557
The locals call it...

812
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:31,102
the Farmers & Mechanics Bank of La Grange.

813
00:53:31,144 --> 00:53:32,979
Looks like a hayseed bank.

814
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:34,983
To tell you the truth, it is a hayseed bank...

815
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:37,194
except the last Friday
of every financial quarter...

816
00:53:37,236 --> 00:53:39,864
there's more cash in that bank
than flies at a barbecue.

817
00:53:39,907 --> 00:53:41,492
Guess what day it is tomorrow?

818
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:43,286
When all the hayseeds come in...

819
00:53:43,328 --> 00:53:46,749
and cash their farm subsidies checks.

820
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,711
A- 1 information.

821
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:51,548
Got it in the joint from Lawrence Spivy...

822
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,051
one of Dick Nixon's
Undersecretary of Agriculture.

823
00:53:54,093 --> 00:53:56,221
He's in for soliciting sex from a state trooper.

824
00:53:56,263 --> 00:53:58,766
Ordinarily we don't associate with that type...

825
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:02,772
but he was trying to make a few brownie points.

826
00:54:02,814 --> 00:54:04,274
Boys, I can't.

827
00:54:04,316 --> 00:54:07,362
We need someone handy with a scatter- gun...

828
00:54:07,404 --> 00:54:10,950
to cover them hayseeds while we get that cash.

829
00:54:10,993 --> 00:54:12,119
You understand, H.I.?

830
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:14,998
If this works out, it's just the beginning...

831
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,585
of a spree to cover the entire Southwest.

832
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:20,464
And we keep going until we can retire...

833
00:54:20,506 --> 00:54:22,550
or we get caught.

834
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,428
Either way, we're fixed for life.

835
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:32,523
Boys, this is a kind offer, but...

836
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:36,236
if you're suggesting I just up and leave Ed...

837
00:54:38,282 --> 00:54:40,660
that would be pretty damn cowardly, wouldn't it?

838
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:43,789
Would it? Think about it, H.I.

839
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:47,794
Seems to me, sitting here,
you ain't doing her any good...

840
00:54:49,631 --> 00:54:51,592
and you ain't bein' true to your own nature.

841
00:55:07,073 --> 00:55:08,658
<i>My dearest Edwina...</i>

842
00:55:10,703 --> 00:55:13,081
<i>tonight as you and Nathan slumber...</i>

843
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:16,085
<i>my heart is filled with anguish.</i>

844
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:20,049
<i>I hope that you will both understand...</i>

845
00:55:20,091 --> 00:55:22,928
<i>and forgive me for what
I have decided I must do.</i>

846
00:55:24,806 --> 00:55:28,269
<i>By the time you read this, I will be gone.</i>

847
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:34,570
<i>I will never be the man
that you want me to be...</i>

848
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:40,746
<i>the husband and father
that you and Nathan deserve.</i>

849
00:55:42,749 --> 00:55:44,543
<i>Maybe it's my upbringing.</i>

850
00:55:45,836 --> 00:55:48,715
<i>Maybe it's just that
my genes got screwed up.</i>

851
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:52,179
<i>I don't know...</i>

852
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:56,393
<i>but the events of the last day...</i>

853
00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:59,731
<i>have showed amply...</i>

854
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,653
<i>that I don't have the strength of character...</i>

855
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:05,322
<i>to raise up a family...</i>

856
00:56:06,574 --> 00:56:09,369
<i>in the manner befitting a responsible adult.</i>

857
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:15,086
<i>I say all this to my shame.</i>

858
00:56:19,217 --> 00:56:21,386
<i>I will love you always...</i>

859
00:56:22,723 --> 00:56:24,141
<i>truly and deeply...</i>

860
00:56:26,311 --> 00:56:29,607
<i>but I fear that if I stay...</i>

861
00:56:29,649 --> 00:56:35,198
<i>I would only bring bad trouble on
the heads of you and Nathan Junior.</i>

862
00:56:36,617 --> 00:56:38,953
<i>I feel the thunder gathering even now.</i>

863
00:56:41,249 --> 00:56:42,417
<i>If I leave...</i>

864
00:56:43,794 --> 00:56:47,883
<i>hopefully, it will leave with me.</i>

865
00:56:51,013 --> 00:56:52,306
<i>I cannot tarry.</i>

866
00:56:54,476 --> 00:56:55,852
<i>Better I should go...</i>

867
00:56:57,188 --> 00:56:59,190
<i>send you money...</i>

868
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:01,235
<i>and let you curse my name.</i>

869
00:57:03,698 --> 00:57:04,908
<i>Your loving...</i>

870
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:11,876
<i>Herbert.</i>

871
00:58:12,796 --> 00:58:15,257
Mr. Arizona, he just barged in.

872
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,010
Should I call Dwayne?

873
00:58:18,137 --> 00:58:20,932
Hell, no. Why wake the security guard?

874
00:58:21,768 --> 00:58:23,228
I'll take care of this.

875
00:58:37,582 --> 00:58:38,750
You got flies.

876
00:58:39,668 --> 00:58:41,545
I doubt it.

877
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:43,966
This place is climate- controlled.

878
00:58:44,008 --> 00:58:45,677
All the windows are sealed.

879
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:49,348
Who the hell are you?

880
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,683
Smalls.

881
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:52,269
Leonard Smalls.

882
00:58:53,354 --> 00:58:57,067
My friends call me Lenny... but I got no friends.

883
00:58:57,861 --> 00:59:00,406
Oh, stop. You're gonna make me bust out cryin'.

884
00:59:00,448 --> 00:59:04,495
Leonard, you want some furniture or a shit box...

885
00:59:04,537 --> 00:59:06,206
they're out there on the sales floor.

886
00:59:06,248 --> 00:59:07,917
I'm not a customer.

887
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:09,586
I'm a manhunter.

888
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:13,383
Now, of course, I do hunt babies on occasion.

889
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,971
I hear you've got one you can't put your hand to.

890
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,725
What do you know about it?

891
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:22,854
That's my business. I'm a tracker.

892
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:25,317
Some say part hound dog.

893
00:59:26,735 --> 00:59:30,448
When some dink busts
out of the joint, skips bail...

894
00:59:30,491 --> 00:59:32,285
I'm the one they call.

895
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:34,538
Mister...

896
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,584
I got the cops, state troopers, Federal B.I...

897
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:39,378
already looking for my boy.

898
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,422
Now, if you got information...

899
00:59:41,465 --> 00:59:43,300
Cops won't find your boy.

900
00:59:44,052 --> 00:59:47,431
A cop couldn't find his
butt if he had a bell on it.

901
00:59:47,473 --> 00:59:50,894
You want to find an outlaw, you call an outlaw.

902
00:59:51,729 --> 00:59:54,274
You want to find a Dunkin' Donuts, call a cop.

903
00:59:56,236 --> 01:00:00,116
Smalls, first off, get your
damn feet off my furniture!

904
01:00:00,158 --> 01:00:02,369
Second off, it's widely known...

905
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:06,166
I posted a twenty- five- grand reward for my boy.

906
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:09,170
Now, if you can find him, claim it.

907
01:00:09,964 --> 01:00:13,176
Short of that... what have we got to talk about?

908
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:17,516
Price...fair price.

909
01:00:19,102 --> 01:00:23,775
It's not what you say it is.
It's what the market will bear.

910
01:00:23,817 --> 01:00:25,360
Simple economics.

911
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:28,365
Other people... and mind you, I know them...

912
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:33,831
that'll pay more than $25,000 for a healthy baby.

913
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:36,668
What are you after?

914
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,587
Give you an idea.

915
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:44,054
Why, as a pup, I myself fetched
$30,000 on the black market...

916
01:00:44,055 --> 01:00:45,931
them was 1954 dollars.

917
01:00:46,808 --> 01:00:51,022
Now, for fifty grand, I'll track him.

918
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,317
I'll find him.

919
01:00:58,074 --> 01:00:59,826
Them people that took him...

920
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:01,746
I'll kick their butts.

921
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:04,708
No extra charge.

922
01:01:06,086 --> 01:01:07,921
And if I don't pay?

923
01:01:07,963 --> 01:01:10,633
I'll get the boy, regardless...

924
01:01:12,345 --> 01:01:14,514
but if you don't pay...

925
01:01:14,556 --> 01:01:16,684
the market will.

926
01:01:16,726 --> 01:01:18,353
You want to know what I think?

927
01:01:19,897 --> 01:01:22,233
I think you're an evil man.

928
01:01:23,778 --> 01:01:26,448
I think this is nothing but a goddamn screw job.

929
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:28,659
I think it's a shakedown.

930
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:31,413
I think you're the one that took Nathan Junior...

931
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:34,793
and you're the one that's
gonna get his butt kicked.

932
01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:37,296
I'm gonna phone the cops right now.

933
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,430
Up and at 'em!

934
01:01:43,472 --> 01:01:45,433
Today's the first day of the rest of your life.

935
01:01:45,475 --> 01:01:46,810
Already you're messing it up.

936
01:01:46,852 --> 01:01:49,564
Missis gonna be back from town soon.

937
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:51,275
Where's the baby?

938
01:01:51,317 --> 01:01:52,944
In the bedroom in his crib.

939
01:01:52,986 --> 01:01:55,030
He's sawin' toothpicks. He'll be fine.

940
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:01,956
You expecting anyone?

941
01:02:01,999 --> 01:02:03,375
No.

942
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:10,720
You two stay out of sight.

943
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:16,937
Mornin', Glen.

944
01:02:16,979 --> 01:02:19,816
I ain't comin' in. I'll just keep my distance.

945
01:02:19,858 --> 01:02:22,278
I didn't invite you in, Glen.

946
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,613
Don't even bother.

947
01:02:23,655 --> 01:02:26,158
First off, you're fired. And that's official.

948
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,912
I kind of figured that, Glen.

949
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:31,624
That ain't the reason I come out here.

950
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:35,004
No. You're in a whole shitload of trouble!

951
01:02:35,046 --> 01:02:37,507
Why don't you just calm down?

952
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,678
Why don't you just make me?

953
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,223
You know that little baby you got?

954
01:02:42,265 --> 01:02:44,351
I know what his real name is.

955
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,521
Keep your voice down, Glen.

956
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:49,942
I'll pitch my voice wherever I please!

957
01:02:49,984 --> 01:02:53,405
His name ain't Hi Junior or Ed Junior...

958
01:02:53,447 --> 01:02:55,241
but it's Junior, all right!

959
01:02:55,283 --> 01:02:57,494
It's Nathan Junior!

960
01:02:57,537 --> 01:02:59,498
Stay away from me, McDunnough!

961
01:02:59,539 --> 01:03:02,626
Yeah, you're an awful big man...

962
01:03:02,669 --> 01:03:05,464
when you got something to clobber a guy with.

963
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:08,385
I ain't a big man.

964
01:03:08,427 --> 01:03:09,553
That's right.

965
01:03:09,596 --> 01:03:12,224
And now, you're at my mercy.

966
01:03:14,352 --> 01:03:16,563
I'm your worst nightmare.

967
01:03:16,606 --> 01:03:18,233
I was just gonna turn you in for the reward...

968
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:20,152
but Dot wants something to cuddle.

969
01:03:20,194 --> 01:03:25,451
So we'll call the baby Glen Junior from now on.

970
01:03:25,493 --> 01:03:27,954
I'll give you a day to break the news to Ed.

971
01:03:32,003 --> 01:03:34,840
Dot will be around tomorrow to pick him up.

972
01:03:36,467 --> 01:03:39,304
Either that, or you go to jail.

973
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:42,768
Say, that reminds me.

974
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:45,856
You'll be getting a doctor bill
in the mail in a few days.

975
01:03:45,897 --> 01:03:48,108
I recommend you pay it!

976
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,266
What's going on here?

977
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:13,019
You know what's going on. It's just business.

978
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:14,813
This can go hard or easy, H.I.

979
01:05:11,102 --> 01:05:12,270
My sweet Lord!

980
01:05:29,462 --> 01:05:30,588
Come on.

981
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:26,001
Good!

982
01:06:26,043 --> 01:06:28,713
Honey, there ain't a thing to be worried about.

983
01:06:28,755 --> 01:06:31,008
We're absolutely gonna get him back.

984
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:32,927
We'll get him back. That's all there is to it.

985
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:36,348
I'm gonna be a better person from here on out.

986
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:38,435
That's final. That's absolutely
the way it's gonna be.

987
01:06:38,477 --> 01:06:40,062
That's official. You were right, I was wrong.

988
01:06:40,105 --> 01:06:41,690
A blind man could tell you that.

989
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:42,900
They ain't gonna hurt him.

990
01:06:42,942 --> 01:06:44,276
They're just in it for the score.

991
01:06:44,277 --> 01:06:47,197
I ain't like that no more. I'm a changed man.

992
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,119
We got a family.
I'm gonna start acting responsibly.

993
01:06:50,161 --> 01:06:52,122
So let's go, honey.

994
01:06:52,164 --> 01:06:54,166
Let's go get Nathan Junior!

995
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,960
All have chicken and dumplings

996
01:06:56,002 --> 01:06:58,463
Yeah, we'll all have chicken and dumplings

997
01:06:58,506 --> 01:06:59,632
When she comes

998
01:07:03,471 --> 01:07:05,682
I lo- o- ove to drive.

999
01:07:05,725 --> 01:07:08,145
Boy, you sure said something there, partner.

1000
01:07:08,146 --> 01:07:09,939
Yes, sir.

1001
01:07:09,981 --> 01:07:13,444
I figure between the ransom and this bank...

1002
01:07:14,946 --> 01:07:18,117
you and I will be sitting
in the fabled catbird seat.

1003
01:07:20,496 --> 01:07:22,957
Gale...um...

1004
01:07:24,126 --> 01:07:27,213
Junior just had a...a...an accident.

1005
01:07:27,255 --> 01:07:29,132
What's that, partner?

1006
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:31,052
He had himself a little old accident.

1007
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:33,013
What do you mean? He looks OK.

1008
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:35,516
No. See, moving, though we are...

1009
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:37,979
he went and had himself a little old rest stop.

1010
01:07:41,275 --> 01:07:42,693
Well, that's natural.

1011
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:47,492
Gale?

1012
01:07:47,534 --> 01:07:48,827
What now, little brother?

1013
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,541
He smiled at me.

1014
01:07:56,464 --> 01:08:00,594
You smiled at me, you. Come here. Yeah.

1015
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:06,102
You know how to put these on?

1016
01:08:06,144 --> 01:08:09,064
Around the butt and up over the groin area.

1017
01:08:09,107 --> 01:08:11,443
I know where they go, old- timer.

1018
01:08:11,485 --> 01:08:14,531
I just want to know whether
I need to use pins or fasteners.

1019
01:08:14,573 --> 01:08:18,703
No. They got those tapettes already on there.

1020
01:08:18,746 --> 01:08:21,291
It's self- contained and fairly explanatory.

1021
01:08:25,464 --> 01:08:26,590
Balloons!

1022
01:08:26,632 --> 01:08:28,885
These blow up into funny shapes?

1023
01:08:28,927 --> 01:08:31,096
Well, no, unless round is funny.

1024
01:08:31,138 --> 01:08:32,848
I'll take those, too.

1025
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:37,647
All right, now!

1026
01:08:37,689 --> 01:08:40,484
Now, you just lie down back there, old- timer.

1027
01:08:40,527 --> 01:08:42,029
Yes, sir!

1028
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:46,744
I want you to count up to
eight hundred twenty- five...

1029
01:08:46,786 --> 01:08:48,246
then on back down to zero.

1030
01:08:48,288 --> 01:08:49,456
OK, then.

1031
01:08:49,498 --> 01:08:51,709
I'm comin' back in five...

1032
01:08:51,751 --> 01:08:53,837
and check to see that you ain't cheatin'.

1033
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:56,257
Open the door!

1034
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,510
He's real cheerful once he warms up to you.

1035
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:01,639
I don't know how high this one can count.

1036
01:09:01,682 --> 01:09:03,142
Six Mississippi...

1037
01:09:03,184 --> 01:09:04,644
seven Mississippi...

1038
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:06,272
eight Mississippi...

1039
01:09:06,314 --> 01:09:07,482
nine Mississippi...

1040
01:09:07,524 --> 01:09:10,486
Got some baby grub, baby wipes.

1041
01:09:10,528 --> 01:09:12,822
Got them diapers, them disposable kind.

1042
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:14,241
I got me a packet of balloons.

1043
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,160
They blow up into funny shapes?

1044
01:09:16,203 --> 01:09:17,830
No. Just circular.

1045
01:09:17,872 --> 01:09:20,375
Say...where's Junior?

1046
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:23,463
- Didn't you put him in?
- I thought...

1047
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:27,218
Where did we leave him?

1048
01:09:45,244 --> 01:09:46,454
No!

1049
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:09,070
- My baby!
- Aah!

1050
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,701
Eight hundred one Mississippi.

1051
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:15,704
Eight hundred Mississippi...

1052
01:10:22,172 --> 01:10:24,550
- Aah!
- Junior!

1053
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:29,932
- Aah! Aah!
- We're on the way!

1054
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,103
Seven hundred and ninety- one...

1055
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,147
Aw, bullshit!

1056
01:10:40,615 --> 01:10:43,368
Seven hundred and ninety- aught Mississippi...

1057
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:50,462
Seven hundred eighty- seven Mississippi...

1058
01:10:50,504 --> 01:10:54,467
Oh, baby! Oh, baby.

1059
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:56,512
Seven hundred eighty- five Mississippi...

1060
01:10:56,554 --> 01:11:00,559
Promise we ain't never gonna leave him, Gale.

1061
01:11:00,602 --> 01:11:04,232
We ain't never gonna give him up again, Evelle.

1062
01:11:04,274 --> 01:11:06,109
He's our little Gale Junior now.

1063
01:11:20,714 --> 01:11:21,882
Ed...

1064
01:11:25,346 --> 01:11:27,724
I realize...

1065
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:32,272
I can't be much of a comfort to you now...

1066
01:11:34,525 --> 01:11:36,653
but let me just say this.

1067
01:11:38,573 --> 01:11:40,367
You'll feel a whole lot better...

1068
01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:42,870
- I don't want to feel better.
- Honey.

1069
01:11:42,912 --> 01:11:45,665
I don't care about myself anymore.

1070
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:47,460
I don't care about us anymore.

1071
01:11:48,963 --> 01:11:50,924
I just want Nathan Junior back safe.

1072
01:11:50,965 --> 01:11:52,133
I know that.

1073
01:11:52,176 --> 01:11:55,305
If we don't get him back,
I don't want to go on living.

1074
01:11:55,347 --> 01:12:00,562
Even if we do get him back,
I don't want to live with you.

1075
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,162
I...I guess I still love you, Hi.

1076
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:15,917
I...I know I do.

1077
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,503
I ain't even blamin' you.

1078
01:12:17,545 --> 01:12:21,759
The whole thing was crazy,
and the whole thing was my idea.

1079
01:12:21,801 --> 01:12:24,847
Factually, I bear a large percentage...

1080
01:12:24,889 --> 01:12:26,057
Let me finish.

1081
01:12:27,351 --> 01:12:29,437
Ever since those jailbirds took Nathan...

1082
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:33,109
I been doin' some thinkin',
and I ain't too proud of myself.

1083
01:12:33,151 --> 01:12:38,491
Even if Mrs. Arizona had
more than she could handle...

1084
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:44,249
I was a police officer sworn to uphold
the Constitution of the United States.

1085
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:46,420
You resigned before we ever...

1086
01:12:46,461 --> 01:12:48,547
That ain't the point, Hi.

1087
01:12:48,589 --> 01:12:50,383
We don't deserve Nathan Junior...

1088
01:12:50,425 --> 01:12:52,594
any more than those jailbirds do.

1089
01:12:53,972 --> 01:12:57,268
If I'm as selfish and irresponsible as you...

1090
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:58,645
You're not that bad.

1091
01:12:58,687 --> 01:13:01,649
If I'm as bad as you,
what good are we to each other?

1092
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,865
You and me's just a fool's paradise.

1093
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:58,189
- There she is.
- Yep.

1094
01:13:59,065 --> 01:14:01,610
Well, let's do her.

1095
01:14:02,403 --> 01:14:04,531
What are we gonna do with Gale Junior?

1096
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:05,824
He stays here.

1097
01:14:05,867 --> 01:14:07,494
Are you crazy?

1098
01:14:07,536 --> 01:14:10,123
Suppose we go in there and get ourselves killed?

1099
01:14:10,164 --> 01:14:12,292
It would be hours before he gets discovered.

1100
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,673
All right, you hayseeds, it's a stickup!

1101
01:14:17,258 --> 01:14:18,885
Everybody freeze.

1102
01:14:18,927 --> 01:14:20,637
Everybody down on the ground.

1103
01:14:26,605 --> 01:14:28,816
Well, which is it, young feller?

1104
01:14:28,858 --> 01:14:31,653
You want I should freeze
or get down on the ground?

1105
01:14:31,695 --> 01:14:36,410
I mean to say, if'n I freeze,
I can't rightly drop.

1106
01:14:36,452 --> 01:14:39,080
If'n I drop, I'm gonna be in motion.

1107
01:14:39,122 --> 01:14:41,750
- Shut up!
- OK, then.

1108
01:14:41,793 --> 01:14:43,879
Everybody down on the ground!

1109
01:14:43,921 --> 01:14:46,215
Forget that part about freezing, now.

1110
01:14:46,258 --> 01:14:49,804
- Till they get down there.
- Y'all hear that, don't you?

1111
01:14:49,846 --> 01:14:51,932
Want to fill this up, partner?

1112
01:14:51,974 --> 01:14:54,394
We gotta...Shit!

1113
01:14:54,436 --> 01:14:56,105
Where'd all the tellers go?

1114
01:14:56,147 --> 01:14:57,690
Down here, sir.

1115
01:14:57,732 --> 01:15:00,778
They're on the ground like you commanded, Gale.

1116
01:15:01,822 --> 01:15:04,116
I told you not to use my damn name.

1117
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:06,536
Can't you try to keep from forgetting that?

1118
01:15:09,457 --> 01:15:11,292
Not even your code name?

1119
01:15:12,962 --> 01:15:15,590
Oh, yeah, yeah. My code name.

1120
01:15:15,633 --> 01:15:18,762
Y'all hear that? We're using code names.

1121
01:15:18,804 --> 01:15:22,058
We're just about ready to
begin the robbery proper!

1122
01:15:27,525 --> 01:15:30,070
Hurry up, you dang hayseed!

1123
01:15:30,112 --> 01:15:33,783
All right. Now, y'all know how this here works.

1124
01:15:33,826 --> 01:15:36,830
And that hayseed over there with the red hat...

1125
01:15:36,872 --> 01:15:38,457
he's the monitor.

1126
01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:39,834
OK, you betcha.

1127
01:15:42,213 --> 01:15:45,509
I want you to stay flat for ten full minutes!

1128
01:15:45,551 --> 01:15:48,263
We might just come back in five to check.

1129
01:15:48,305 --> 01:15:50,808
That's for us to know, and y'all to find out.

1130
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:53,395
Anyone found bipedal in
five wears his ass for a hat.

1131
01:16:05,746 --> 01:16:08,458
That old- timer threw off my concentration...

1132
01:16:09,209 --> 01:16:11,044
otherwise, it would've gone smoother.

1133
01:16:11,087 --> 01:16:12,797
Shoot, Gale, we done good.

1134
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,510
This ought to split up nice three ways.

1135
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:22,228
God damn it! You never leave a man behind!

1136
01:16:47,431 --> 01:16:49,100
- Where's the baby?
- Where's the baby?

1137
01:16:49,142 --> 01:16:52,563
God damn it! Ain't we got enough to contend with?

1138
01:16:52,605 --> 01:16:54,566
I don't know, ma'am.

1139
01:16:54,608 --> 01:16:57,486
You never leave a man behind!

1140
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:01,117
Miz McDunnough, I'm worried sick about him!

1141
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:04,121
Hold on, H.I. Don't be such a hothead!

1142
01:17:04,163 --> 01:17:05,456
H.I.!

1143
01:17:05,498 --> 01:17:07,834
Miz McDunnough!

1144
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:10,505
- Let us come with you!
- Please!

1145
01:17:10,547 --> 01:17:12,508
It's our baby, too!

1146
01:17:41,383 --> 01:17:43,427
What is he?

1147
01:17:43,469 --> 01:17:45,597
Do you see him, too?

1148
01:19:04,961 --> 01:19:06,171
Give me that baby!

1149
01:19:07,673 --> 01:19:09,258
I want that baby!

1150
01:19:12,346 --> 01:19:14,974
Give me that baby, you warthog from hell!

1151
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:39,467
Just lay down on the floor, young missy.

1152
01:19:59,872 --> 01:20:01,123
Run along, now, honey.

1153
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,334
But, Hi...

1154
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,632
Just run along, now. Whoa!

1155
01:22:06,428 --> 01:22:07,971
I'm sorry.

1156
01:23:06,472 --> 01:23:08,600
What the hell's goin' on?

1157
01:23:09,894 --> 01:23:11,479
Get away from there!

1158
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:30,339
Let's go.

1159
01:23:30,382 --> 01:23:32,843
Wait a minute.

1160
01:23:32,885 --> 01:23:34,554
I ain't through with you.

1161
01:23:35,556 --> 01:23:38,268
What are you doing creeping
around here in the dark?

1162
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,436
You in with Smalls?

1163
01:23:39,478 --> 01:23:41,105
Excuse me?

1164
01:23:41,147 --> 01:23:43,525
Leonard Smalls. Big fella.

1165
01:23:43,567 --> 01:23:45,236
Rides a Harley.

1166
01:23:45,278 --> 01:23:46,780
Dresses like a rock star.

1167
01:23:48,825 --> 01:23:52,371
No, sir. That's who we saved him from.

1168
01:23:53,414 --> 01:23:54,707
It's a long story.

1169
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:56,711
Suppose you tell it.

1170
01:23:56,753 --> 01:24:00,633
Well, sir, in a reward situation...

1171
01:24:00,675 --> 01:24:02,844
they usually say no questions asked.

1172
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,725
Oh...do they?

1173
01:24:06,767 --> 01:24:07,935
Yeah.

1174
01:24:14,862 --> 01:24:16,864
all right, boy.

1175
01:24:19,034 --> 01:24:21,412
I guess you got a reward coming.

1176
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:25,126
Twenty- five thousand dollars...

1177
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:30,133
or...if you need home furnishings...

1178
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:32,637
I can give you a line of
credit at any of my stores.

1179
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:35,725
That's the way I'd rather handle it. Tax reasons.

1180
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:37,936
We don't want no reward.

1181
01:24:37,978 --> 01:24:39,772
We didn't bring him back for money.

1182
01:24:39,814 --> 01:24:41,399
We could work it that way, too.

1183
01:24:42,651 --> 01:24:46,531
Could I just look at him a little bit more?

1184
01:24:48,201 --> 01:24:49,744
Be my guest, little lady.

1185
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:54,459
But, uh...

1186
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,049
would...would you mind telling
me exactly how you...

1187
01:25:07,687 --> 01:25:10,482
You took him...didn't you?

1188
01:25:11,526 --> 01:25:13,153
Wasn't that biker at all.

1189
01:25:13,195 --> 01:25:15,072
I took him, sir.

1190
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:17,618
My wife had nothing to do with it.

1191
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:19,412
I crept in yon window...

1192
01:25:19,454 --> 01:25:20,997
We both did it.

1193
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,209
We didn't want to hurt him any.

1194
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:24,711
I just wanted to be a mama.

1195
01:25:24,712 --> 01:25:27,549
It wasn't for money or nothing.

1196
01:25:27,591 --> 01:25:31,012
We just figured you had more
than you could handle, babywise.

1197
01:25:31,054 --> 01:25:33,766
But I committed the actual crime...

1198
01:25:33,808 --> 01:25:35,769
so if you need to call the authorities...

1199
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:38,314
Shut up, boy. Nobody's calling the authorities...

1200
01:25:38,356 --> 01:25:39,440
since there's no harm done.

1201
01:25:39,483 --> 01:25:40,609
Thank you, sir.

1202
01:25:40,651 --> 01:25:43,989
Bullshit. Just tell me why you did it.

1203
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:48,621
We...

1204
01:25:50,498 --> 01:25:52,208
can't have one of our own.

1205
01:25:59,177 --> 01:26:04,142
look, if you can't have kids,
you just got to keep trying...

1206
01:26:04,185 --> 01:26:07,105
and hope medical science catches up with you...

1207
01:26:07,106 --> 01:26:08,815
like Florence and me.

1208
01:26:09,985 --> 01:26:11,612
Caught up with a vengeance.

1209
01:26:12,947 --> 01:26:16,744
But, hell, even if it never does for you...

1210
01:26:16,786 --> 01:26:19,373
you still got each other.

1211
01:26:20,374 --> 01:26:24,588
Sir...those are kind words, but...

1212
01:26:24,631 --> 01:26:28,887
I think the wife and I are splitting up.

1213
01:26:28,928 --> 01:26:31,473
Her point is that we're both kind of...

1214
01:26:32,308 --> 01:26:34,394
selfish and unrealistic...

1215
01:26:34,436 --> 01:26:37,315
so we ain't too good for each other.

1216
01:26:38,025 --> 01:26:41,905
Well, ma'am, I don't know much...

1217
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,616
but I do know human beings.

1218
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:47,120
You brought back my boy...

1219
01:26:47,163 --> 01:26:51,001
so...you must have your good points, too.

1220
01:26:54,715 --> 01:26:57,302
Sure hate to think of Florence leaving me.

1221
01:26:59,138 --> 01:27:03,310
I...do...love her so.

1222
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:15,995
You can go out the way you came in...

1223
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:19,792
and before you go off
and do another foolish thing...

1224
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:22,087
like bustin' up...

1225
01:27:22,129 --> 01:27:24,590
I suggest you sleep on it...

1226
01:27:25,968 --> 01:27:27,511
at least one night.

1227
01:27:30,099 --> 01:27:32,852
That night I had a dream.

1228
01:27:33,729 --> 01:27:36,399
I dreamt I was as light as the ether...

1229
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:41,114
a floating spirit visiting things to come.

1230
01:27:42,742 --> 01:27:46,038
The shades and shadows
of the people in my life...

1231
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,500
rassled their way into my slumber.

1232
01:27:50,461 --> 01:27:54,508
I dreamt that Gale and Evelle
had decided to return to prison.

1233
01:27:54,551 --> 01:27:56,887
Probably that's just as well.

1234
01:27:56,929 --> 01:27:58,681
I don't mean to sound superior...

1235
01:27:58,723 --> 01:28:01,769
and they're a swell couple guys...

1236
01:28:02,646 --> 01:28:06,151
but maybe they weren't ready
yet to come out into the world.

1237
01:28:08,487 --> 01:28:11,032
And then I dreamed on...

1238
01:28:11,074 --> 01:28:12,784
into the future...

1239
01:28:13,745 --> 01:28:16,707
to a Christmas morn in the Arizona home...

1240
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:20,171
where Nathan Junior was opening a present...

1241
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,214
from a kindly couple...

1242
01:28:22,299 --> 01:28:24,510
who preferred to remain unknown.

1243
01:28:26,889 --> 01:28:29,893
I saw Glen a few years later...

1244
01:28:29,976 --> 01:28:32,729
still having no luck
getting the cops to listen...

1245
01:28:32,772 --> 01:28:35,442
to his wild tales about me and Ed.

1246
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:40,700
Maybe he threw in one Polack joke too many.

1247
01:28:41,493 --> 01:28:43,287
I don't know.

1248
01:28:45,123 --> 01:28:47,584
And still I dreamed on...

1249
01:28:48,378 --> 01:28:52,634
further into the future than
I'd ever dreamed before...

1250
01:28:53,802 --> 01:28:56,973
watching Nathan Junior's progress from afar...

1251
01:28:58,016 --> 01:29:01,771
taking pride in his accomplishments...

1252
01:29:01,813 --> 01:29:03,440
as if he were our own...

1253
01:29:04,484 --> 01:29:07,989
wondering if he ever thought of us...

1254
01:29:08,782 --> 01:29:12,620
and hoping maybe we'd broadened
his horizons a little...

1255
01:29:13,497 --> 01:29:16,835
even if he couldn't remember
just how they got broadened.

1256
01:29:19,255 --> 01:29:22,760
But still I hadn't dreamt
nothing about me and Ed...

1257
01:29:23,887 --> 01:29:25,305
until the end.

1258
01:29:26,766 --> 01:29:28,476
And this was cloudier...

1259
01:29:29,311 --> 01:29:33,525
'cause it was years... years away...

1260
01:29:35,612 --> 01:29:39,367
but I saw an old couple
being visited by their children...

1261
01:29:40,243 --> 01:29:42,412
and all their grandchildren, too.

1262
01:29:43,915 --> 01:29:46,376
The old couple wasn't screwed up...

1263
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:51,008
and neither were their kids or their grandkids.

1264
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:52,677
Dad.

1265
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,767
And I don't know. You tell me.

1266
01:29:57,601 --> 01:29:59,144
This whole dream...

1267
01:30:00,689 --> 01:30:02,483
was it wishful thinking?

1268
01:30:03,652 --> 01:30:09,201
Was I just fleeing reality
like I know I'm liable to do?

1269
01:30:10,328 --> 01:30:11,663
But me and Ed...

1270
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,210
we can be good, too.

1271
01:30:16,545 --> 01:30:18,255
And it seemed real.

1272
01:30:20,008 --> 01:30:21,927
It seemed like us...

1273
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:24,139
and it seemed like...

1274
01:30:26,935 --> 01:30:28,270
our home.

1275
01:30:30,148 --> 01:30:34,988
If not Arizona, then a land not too far away...

1276
01:30:36,407 --> 01:30:40,537
where all parents are strong
and wise and capable...

1277
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:44,460
and all children are happy and beloved.

1278
01:30:46,713 --> 01:30:47,923
I don't know.

1279
01:30:50,594 --> 01:30:52,263
Maybe it was Utah.

1280
01:30:53,305 --> 01:31:53,477
