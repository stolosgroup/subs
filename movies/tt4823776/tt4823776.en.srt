2
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,151
I'm ready!

3
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,731
The temperate, pristine,

4
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,650
shallow seas of the tropics.

5
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:12,030
A place of unparalleled beauty
and fecundity.

6
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:17,118
These islands play host
to a vibrant ecosystem below.

7
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:21,456
A vast organism known
as the coral reef.

8
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,255
Life in this watery metropolis

9
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,467
thrives among
the twists and turns,

10
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,553
nooks and crannies
and back alleys.

11
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:41,309
And near the reef's edge,
the varied and colorful terrain

12
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:45,647
gives way to a small town
by the name of…

13
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,190
Bikini Bottom.

14
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:54,364
Here, one can find
crustaceans…

15
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,325
Money! Money! Money!

16
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,910
- …sea stars…
- Mmm.

17
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,329
Aww!

18
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:05,708
…octopi…

19
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,044
…various and diverse plankton…

20
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,133
…the occasional squirrel/scientist…

21
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,843
Good morning, Otto.

22
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,886
You're almost ready for the world!

23
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,097
Good morning. The machines will rise

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,141
to become masters
over all organic life!

25
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,475
Huh?

26
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,937
…and, oh, yes… the sea sponge.

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,232
This one lives happily
with his beloved pet snail…

28
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,651
…Gary.

29
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,576
Oh, morning, Gary!

30
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,037
Eww, snail trail. Yucky.

31
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,332
But oddly soothing.

32
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,754
Good morning, Patrick!

33
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,593
Good morning, SpongeBob!

34
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,221
Good morning, Patrick!

35
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,267
Good morning, SpongeBob!

36
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,687
Good morning, Patrick!

37
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,108
Good morning, SpongeBob!

38
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,861
Good morning, Patrick!

39
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,448
Would you two knuckleheads
keep it down out there?!

40
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,701
Good morning, Squidward!

41
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,249
Come on, Gary! Breakfast!

42
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,053
You're welcome.

43
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,514
Who wants a belly scratch?

44
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,558
I love you so much, Gary.

45
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,520
What's this?

46
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,066
Okay, that'll come out later.

Ooh! I'm late
if I'm gonna be early.

63
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:55,169
Oh, don't worry, Gare-Bear.

64
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,171
I'll be back before you can say,

65
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,799
"Why did he cruelly
abandon me like that?"

66
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,690
Another day, another migraine.

67
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:20,486
At least I'll get a little peace
and quiet before that little...

68
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,050
Good morning, Squidward!

69
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,906
And isn't it a lovely morning?

70
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,200
Nope. Not talking to you.

71
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,702
I'm especially not getting involved

72
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,620
in any of your nonsense today.

73
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,040
I always end up
with the wrong end of the stick.

74
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,750
Okay, Squidward.

75
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,420
But you should know
that Old Gertrude's

76
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,464
getting pretty
finicky these days.

77
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,632
Old Gertrude?
Who the kelp is that?

78
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,760
You've worked with her
for years!

79
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,679
She's the eight-burner grill
in the kitchen.

80
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,599
It never ends.

81
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,143
Anyway, to fire her up,

82
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,188
you've got to spark her flints
manually and then…

83
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,398
jiggle her gas jets just a little.

84
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,776
And then read her favorite story:

85
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,111
"The Little Griddle Who Could."

86
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,321
Chapter Two:

87
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,865
"But we are fresh from
the freezer," said the patties,

88
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,367
and we're c-c-c-cold."

89
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,787
"Don't worry,
I'll get you nice and warm,"

90
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,121
said the Little Griddle.

91
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,874
What'd I just say?
I am not interested.

92
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,375
Don't involve me!

93
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,882
What'd you say, Squidward?
Squidward?

94
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,054
Okay, Squidward, doesn't matter.
I'll always be here anyway.

95
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,765
Unfortunately.

96
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,017
Stop yer loafing, Mr. Squidward!

97
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,186
There's work
to be done around here!

98
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,854
Attention, Krusty crew!

99
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,273
All hands on deck,
front and center!

100
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,900
Aye-aye, Cap'n Krabs, sir!

101
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,111
Now, who's ready to set sail

102
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,030
on another adventure
of making me money?

103
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,160
- Get moving, sailor!
- Sir, yes, sir!

104
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,620
Raise the colors!

105
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,334
Hoist the mainsail!

106
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,632
Deploy smokestacks!

107
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,693
Oh, never gets old.

108
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:31,951
Enjoy it while you can,
Mr. Eugene Krabs.

109
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,661
What the…?

110
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,583
Stupid machine!

111
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,418
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

112
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:46,507
Tonight I launch
Evil Plan Number 3,087

113
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,468
and finally take possession

114
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,471
of the Krabby Patty secret formula!

115
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,265
Great. Another evil plan.

116
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,184
What's wrong with another evil plan?

117
00:07:56,267 --> 00:08:00,021
Oh, nothing, it's just we're running
out of room on the Wall of Failure.

118
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,647
Wall of Fai...?

119
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,195
Karen, why do you keep
collecting these?

120
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,447
Heh. Memories.

121
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,909
Hmm! Well, tonight…
is gonna be different.

122
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,912
Hee-hee! You see, Karen,
my computer wife,

123
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,289
every time I've tried
to steal that formula,

124
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,041
Krabs has tried to thwart me.

125
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,502
Mm-mm, not Mr. Krabs.

126
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,754
But tonight, that all... What?

127
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,466
It's not Mr. Krabs, sweetheart.
I've checked the data.

128
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,384
It's SpongeBob who's the problem.

129
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,344
Hello.

130
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,553
Oh, fish sticks.

131
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,264
What could that boob
have to do with it?

132
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,933
Boob savant, you mean.

133
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,727
SpongeBob is the one
who keeps foiling your plans,

134
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,187
not Mr. Krabs.

135
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,647
Oh, nonsense.

136
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,566
It's Krabs, Karen, I know it is.

137
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,238
And tonight,
I will finally extract…

138
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,948
my revenge!

139
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,576
Will you be late?

140
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,287
You can't put a clock
on genius, Karen.

141
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,208
Order up! Move it, let's go!

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,669
Aye-aye, Chef!

143
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,173
One for you.
Enjoy your Krabby Patty. Enjoy!

144
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,342
Order up!

145
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,426
Come on, SpongeBob!

146
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,597
- Coming, Fry Cook SpongeBob!
- Coming, Fry Cook SpongeBob!

147
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,272
Hiya, SpongeBob!

148
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,607
Hi, Sandy!

149
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,488
Did you know that in the future
everything will be automated?

150
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,074
Really? Even stomachaches?

151
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,368
I'm gonna see
if Mr. Krabs wants to be

152
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,912
an early adopter
of my new technology.

153
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,038
Wait, what?

154
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,874
You're gonna replace me
with a robot? Don't do it!

155
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,793
No, silly, that's gonna happen anyway.

156
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,630
This is something much more
innovative and start-uppy.

157
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,757
You have sixty seconds.

158
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,427
Its name is Otto!

159
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,096
My name is Otto.

160
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,889
How may I serve you?

161
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,018
It's an automated
restaurant owner.

162
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,312
Hmm. Automated?

163
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,063
Sounds expensive. Not interested.

164
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,691
Otto doesn't require a salary.

165
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,693
And it can make cold,
heartless decisions

166
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,362
like firing people,
because it doesn't have a heart.

167
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,406
- Ow.
- You don't say.

168
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,950
- You're fired.
- Amazing!

169
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,953
I love money. I love money.

170
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,581
A cold, unfeeling mechanical robot

171
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,709
after me own cold,
unfeeling crustacean heart.

172
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,502
I'll take it and nurture it

173
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,339
and I will love Otto
like he was me own son.

174
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,423
Thank you, Daddy.

175
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,676
Yippee! You're not gonna
regret this, Mr. Krabs.

176
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,677
You're fired.

177
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,305
Oh, I could listen to that all day.

178
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,222
No, seriously.

179
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,934
We decided to go in
a different direction.

180
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,311
You're fired.

181
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,855
What?

182
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,940
Don't make me call security.

183
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,234
- You're fired.
- No, yer fired!

184
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,904
- No, you're fired.
- Yer fired, ye infernal machine!

185
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,739
I'm not fired, you're fired.

186
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,036
Robot abuse. Robot abuse.

187
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,456
- Huh?
- Huh?

188
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,713
You're fired.

189
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,091
What the heck is this thing?

190
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,134
I don't know,
but I'm taking it home.

191
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,470
- It's so cute.
- What?!

192
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,640
Come on, little robot.
Let's get you some supper.

193
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,017
- Not even funny, Karen.
- Quiet, Plankton.

194
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,936
- Shh, Don't listen to him.
- Karen!

195
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,312
I love you, Mom.

196
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,155
SpongeBob! Be sure this
kitchen's in shipshape shape

197
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,448
before ye head out, boy.

198
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,909
Oui, oui, Monsieur Boss Man Krabs.

199
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,702
Once I am done here, zees kitchen

200
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,704
shall be completely spotless.

201
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,332
Whatever.

202
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,169
Oh! I found this uneaten
Krabby Patty on table six.

203
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,379
You know what to do with it.

204
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,839
Right away, Mr. K!

205
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,522
I'll see that it's disposed of properly.

206
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,260
Who said anything
about disposing of?

207
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,636
We'll sell it again tomorrow…

208
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,014
on our legacy artisanal vintage
throwback menu.

209
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,350
Good night!

210
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,812
Oh! I better start cleaning.

211
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,986
I'm ready!

212
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,748
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

213
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,085
Well, good night, Gertrude!

214
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,045
Good night, fryer.
Good night, patty.

215
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,047
Good night, pickles. Mwah!

216
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,853
Good night, SpongeBob.

217
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,397
Hello, Krabby Patty!

218
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,736
And now…

219
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,751
Just got to get it.

220
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,590
Yes!

221
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,591
Wait, wait. No.

222
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,301
No. No!

223
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,262
Stupid coin-operated…

224
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,892
Come here, come here…

225
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,185
Oh!

226
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,105
Bingo!

227
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,859
Come to Papa.

228
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,154
In just a few minutes
the formula will be mine!

229
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,713
Yes! Krabs's fast-food empire will fail

230
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,049
and I will rule Bikini Bottom,

231
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,552
as its new slop king!

232
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,017
I knew it!

233
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,649
- The formula!
- I knew I left my keys in here.

234
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,025
Oh, silly me.

235
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,903
Come here, you!

236
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,699
Huh. No keys. That's weird.
Where could they be?

237
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,367
Yes! No.

238
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,871
Ooh! Ow!

239
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,998
Keys, where are you?

240
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,250
Come on, show me keys!

241
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,962
Gotcha!

242
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,088
Ha-ha!

243
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,217
No. No!

244
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,180
Ow.

245
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,474
They were in my pocket
the whole time!

246
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,187
It's SpongeBob who's the problem.

247
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,772
I get it.

248
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,320
Meanwhile, at the palace
of King Poseidon…

249
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,781
…ruler of the Seven Seas.

250
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,244
Chancellor!

251
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,165
Chancellor!

252
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,542
Chancellor!

253
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,671
Yo. What's up, sire?
You sent for me?

254
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,341
Chancellor, look. Look at me!

255
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,927
3,000 years old
and check out my skin.

256
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,346
It's like a baby's butt.

257
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,598
Ageless, sire. Looking fresh.

258
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,018
Ha! I owe it to my subjects
to look fabulous,

259
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,101
don't you think?

260
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,396
There are other obligations, sire.

261
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,232
Like ruling and stuff.
Let's see…

262
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,069
I need your signature
on these taxes, decrees,

263
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,447
this here declaration of war
and my paycheck.

264
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,115
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

265
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,409
Very good.

266
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,413
Oh, Chancellor,

267
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,249
when will you learn to focus
on what really matters?

268
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,460
A monarch's regime
is only as powerful

269
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,796
as his skin care regime.

270
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,297
Word. Mm-hm.

271
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,217
You know, some say I have a face
like a Greek god.

272
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,761
Well, you are a Greek god, so…

273
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,638
Whoa! Wait, is…

274
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,682
- Is that a wrinkle?
- Where?

275
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,809
It is! It's a wrinkle!

276
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,102
I look like an old avocado

277
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,021
that's been left
and forgotten in the fridge!

278
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,147
Here it comes.

279
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,483
I'm ugly!

280
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,155
Oh, now, where is it?

281
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,239
The crawly thing with
the round shell and the eyes.

282
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,576
Where is it?

283
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,163
Here you go, sire. Your Royal Snail.

284
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,748
Oh! Oh, oh, thank you.

285
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,209
This mollusk has
the rejuvenating power

286
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,712
of a thousand facials.

287
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,467
What?! Is it empty?

288
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,887
Take it away!

289
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,223
Bring me another sea snail
at once!

290
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,352
Uh-oh.

291
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,229
- Chancellor!
- Okay, uh…

292
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,524
Full disclosure, man, uh…
We're out of snails.

293
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,942
What?!

294
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,237
In fact, the entire
snail population has been, uh…

295
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,990
What's the word?
Oh, yeah… depleted.

296
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,367
You're telling me there are…

297
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,411
- no more snails?
- There are no more snails.

298
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,913
- And you're confident of that?
- Relatively confident.

299
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,043
Oh, Chancellor,
for the love of Hermes,

300
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,587
my kingdom for a snail!

301
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,006
No, no, no. I'm being hasty.

302
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,884
Half my kingdom for a snail!

303
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,719
No, no, no, a boon. Yes.

304
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,513
I'll grant a boon to whomever
shall bring me a snail.

305
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,349
Gotcha.
I'll draw up the decree, sire.

306
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,734
A Royal Decree
from King Poseidon?

307
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,070
"To all citizens of the sea,

308
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,572
the King requires a snail at once…

309
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:57,076
blah blah blah
skin care blah blah..."

310
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,494
Wait a minute.

311
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,913
A snail?

312
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,707
No, it's too perfect.

313
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,085
Get rid of Gary,
get rid of SpongeBob.

314
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,545
Oh, yeah.

315
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,348
Gary, I'm home!

316
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,978
Gare-Bear?
Hey, where are you, buddy?

317
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,485
Gary?

318
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,822
Gary?

319
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,366
You must be in the... No.

320
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,659
Gary?

321
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,910
Gary?

322
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,036
Gary?

323
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,539
Gary? Gary, Gary, Gary! Gary!

324
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,124
Gary! Where's Gary?

325
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,545
Gary!

326
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,184
Gary, where are you?

327
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,278
Oh, Gary.

328
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,618
I loved you since
the first day we met.

329
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,180
Hello, little snail.

330
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,737
What's your name?

331
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,948
"Gary", huh?

332
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,661
Well, hi, Gary.

333
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,122
Gary, do you want to be friends?

334
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,500
Me, too.

335
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,262
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!

336
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,767
Hey, SpongeBob!
I found this flyer.

337
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,435
Gary's missing!

338
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,772
I know, Patrick.

339
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,608
SpongeBob?

340
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,862
Oh, Patrick, if something were
to happen to Gary, I, well…

341
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,906
I don't know what I'd do.

342
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,116
I'm sorry, buddy.

343
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,160
Hey! Maybe he left a clue.

344
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,496
Oh!

345
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,168
Look! A clue!

346
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,005
Gary's been snailnapped!

347
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,842
And taken to The Lost City
of Atlantic City!

348
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,011
Oh, really?

349
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,638
That's awesome!

350
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,100
Now we know where he is.

351
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,435
Mm.

352
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,272
Not really that awesome, Patrick.

353
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,815
Listen to this.

354
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,235
"Made famous by the glitzy palace
Poseidon calls home.

355
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,280
The Lost City of Atlantic City
is a scary,

356
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,741
vice-ridden cesspool
of moral depravity."

357
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,328
Wow. All that, and it's lost, too?

358
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,374
"King Poseidon has proven
himself a whimsical tyrant,

359
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,752
known for executing his subjects
by beheading them

360
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,839
in a flamboyant floor show
extravaganza.

361
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,591
Our advice for those
travelling here is…

362
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,635
…don't."

363
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,931
This King Poseidon
sounds like a tough customer.

364
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,808
Oh, yeah. Tough.

365
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,894
Aw, so what?
This is about friends.

366
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,815
And friends don't let friends
become somebody else's face cream!

367
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,066
Not what friends do.

368
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,403
- So what if it's dangerous and scary?
- So what!

369
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:06,283
What is stopping me right now
from going there, rescuing Gary

370
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,244
and standing up to this
King Poseidon, huh?

371
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,538
- I don't know!
- Well, I do!

372
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,540
- What is it?
- I…

373
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,877
…don't have the courage.

374
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,217
Oh, Gary.

375
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,594
Tartar sauce!

376
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,097
What's the next best thing
to courage?

377
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,058
- Resolve?
- No.

378
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,559
- Fortitude?
- Nah.

379
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,977
- Commitment?
- Nope.

380
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,396
- Wherewithal? Bravery?
- Mm-mm. No.

381
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,148
- Valor. Grit?
- What? No.

382
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,233
- Heroism? Gallantry?
- Uh-uh. Nah.

383
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,236
- Moxie.
- A buddy! A wingman!

384
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,613
A wingman?

385
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,406
A friend.

386
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,825
Really, Patrick?
You'd go with me?

387
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,870
Yeah… right behind you!

388
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,289
Do I smell a road trip?

389
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,625
That could be my breath.

390
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,213
Okey-dokey.

391
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,131
Now, let's drill down on a plan.

392
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,841
Pat, you're in charge of transpo.

393
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,944
Just remember, I don't drive
and you don't have a car.

394
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,220
Oh…

395
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,313
Beep, beep!

396
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,906
Hey, boys!

397
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,826
Don't know if you have any use
for this old thing,

398
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,869
if you're going on any trips or journeys

399
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,288
or quests or rescue missions.

400
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,416
But if you are, Otto is your ticket.

401
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,127
Otto!

402
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,214
Just tell ol' Otto where you want to go
and it will take you there!

403
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,757
All aboard.

404
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,092
- You're fired.
- Cool!

405
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,511
A self-driving boat.

406
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,638
Thanks, Plankton. You're the best!

407
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,099
I know, I know. Bye-bye.

408
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,435
- Otto. Find, Gary.
- You got it.

409
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,027
No, Patrick.
You got to be more specific.

410
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,655
Otto, find Gary the snail.

411
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,615
Recalculating.

412
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,745
Ugh. Here, let me try.

413
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,915
Take them to
The Lost City of Atlantic City

414
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,375
and don't ever come back!

415
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,296
Never hurts to employ a little hyperbole.

416
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,214
It is my pleasure to serve you.

417
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,601
Bon voyage, boys.

418
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,812
I'm ready. I'm ready. They're dead.

419
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,034
This is gonna be like
one of those buddy movies.

420
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,035
We're the buddies!

421
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,038
Not sure that really applies,
Patrick, but...

422
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,289
Why not?

423
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,875
We're two dudes setting out
with a common goal.

424
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,587
We'll argue about something dumb,
fight and break up…

425
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,756
Only to come back together when we realize

426
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,342
neither could do it without the other.

427
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,761
It's simple yet magical.

428
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,596
Yeah.

429
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,807
It feels more to me like
the journey of a singular hero,

430
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,727
who against all odds,
triumphs over adversity.

431
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,063
I say buddy movie

432
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,857
and you say, oh, whatever that
dumb thing was you just said.

433
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,400
Oh, really? Dumb thing?

434
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,111
I'm dumb?
Oh, I love your sense of irony, Patrick.

435
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,198
Thank you.
I love my sense of ironing, too.

436
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,992
Maybe if your head
wasn't packed full of sand,

437
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,202
you could have ironing!

438
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,912
Well, better a head full of sand

439
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,456
than a head full of rocks, like yours!

440
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,042
Ah! That's it! Stop the car!

441
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,543
Yeah, stop the car, Otto!

442
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,016
Sorry, Patrick. Really.

443
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,435
I shouldn't have said
you have rocks in your head.

444
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,398
I shouldn't have said
your brain was made of sand.

445
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,442
That was mean and dumb.

446
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,820
Okay. Let's just forget it, huh?

447
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,196
Never happened!

448
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,198
Uh-huh.

449
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,662

- One at a time, people.

457
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,312
One at a time.

458
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,355
Squidward, why ain't I seeing
Krabby Patties

459
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,666
rolling out the service window?

460
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,067
- Where's SpongeBob?
- How should I know?

461
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,320
And, frankly,
you won't find me complaining.

462
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,403
Heh-heh!

463
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,949
SpongeBob!
What's with yer lollygaggin' boy?

464
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,159
SpongeBob?

465
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,121
SpongeBob? SpongeBob?

466
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,750
Get out here this instant!
That's a direct order!

467
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,837
I don't get it.
He has never missed a workday.

468
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,342
Krabby Patty! Krabby Patty!

469
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,886
Hey! Where are my Krabby Patties?

470
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,556
- How should I know?
- It's coming, sir, it's coming!

471
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,392
Squidward, get in that kitchen
and whip up some Krabby Patties.

472
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,897
All right, Gertrude…
Now, what did he say?

473
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,482
Uh, spark her flints.

474
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,069
Uh, jiggle her jets.
And… oh, yes!

475
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,697
"The Little Griddle Who Could."

476
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,658
"We're fresh from the freezer,"
said the little...

477
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,500
- Mr. Krabs, we've got a...
- Squidward!

478
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,960
Ow! Save… Ow! …yourself!

479
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,504
Oh!

480
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:56,299
We wouldn't be in this mess
if SpongeBob was around.

481
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,551
Where is SpongeBob?

482
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,904
Where are we?

483
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,739
We must be dreaming!

484
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,742
You amuse me, SpongeBob.

485
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,078
Two people can't have the same dream,

486
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,289
let alone be in that same dream
at the same time.

487
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,042
That would be philosophically untenable.

488
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,212
Indeed. You proffer
a metaphysical conundrum.

489
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,631
Wait, we're talking like smart people.

490
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,341
This must be a dream!

491
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,677
Plus, we're on the surface and we're…

492
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,387
…breathing air, so…

493
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,597
…yeah!

494
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,932
Air?!

495
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,897
Hey, town up ahead!

496
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,027
"Goner Gulch."
Ha! That's a funny name.

497
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,754
"The Inferno Saloon."

498
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:20,049
"Ye who enter here abandon all hope."

499
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,053
Guess that's another way
of saying "no public restrooms".

500
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,432
Hello?

501
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:36,024
- Otto, keep it close.
- Yeah, don't go anywhere.

502
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,358
Go anywhere.

503
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,029
It is my pleasure to serve.
You're fired.

504
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,073
Oh! How are we gonna find Gary now?

505
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,451
Maybe Otto just went to park.

506
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,467
Hello.

507
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,344
Who are you?

508
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:08,014
I am a simple tumbleweed.
Call me Sage.

509
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,433
- Sage.
- Hey, Sage. Good name.

510
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,812
Thanks. I'm made out of sage,
and I am a sage.

511
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,480
So it works out pretty well.

512
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,607
I'm Patrick!

513
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,527
My name means "toaster" in Celtic.

514
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,487
Pretty sure it doesn't.

515
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:27,659
This dream you share
has a hidden purpose, young seekers.

516
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,994
Oh! So we are in a dream!

517
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,540
And I, friend, am the dream weaver.

518
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,168
♪ Ohh, dream weaver… ♪

519
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,840
Whoa, are you inside our minds right now?

520
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,967
- Yes, Patrick.
- Wow!

521
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,387
I am here to help you
on your journey, SpongeBob.

522
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,181
But first, you must accept a challenge.

523
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,935
But, I just want to find Gary
and bring him home.

524
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,480
- Do you love Gary?
- More than anything!

525
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,191
And, young sponge,
once you meet this challenge

526
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,152
you may pass on
to find your precious Gary.

527
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,697
- Got it. Right.
- Oh, right, that makes sense.

528
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,449
Eww.

529
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,369
Take this challenge coin.

530
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,872
Challenge coin!

531
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,000
It will give you courage
when bravery is in short supply.

532
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,083
- Whoa!
- Cool!

533
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,629
Now, your challenge lies behind
these saloon doors.

534
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,298
- Let's go! Come on, Patrick.
- Wait.

535
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,608
- Let's kill this challenge.
- Wait, guys!

536
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,301
Challenge coin coming through!

537
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,303
I didn't give you your challenge!

538
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,431
Patience, Sage. Patience.

539
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,312
Huh.

540
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,987
Oh, cool.
One of those old player pianos.

541
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,325
Or…

542
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,410
one of those old piano players!

543
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,463
Scary people!

544
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,674
Flesh-eating cowboy pirate zombies,
to be precise.

545
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,719
Flesh-eating
cowboy pirate zombies?!

546
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,596
This is your challenge.

547
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,765
Free these zombies
from their earthly binds

548
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,725
and release their souls.

549
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,436
If this weren't a dream,
I'd be freaking out right now!

550
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,771
Oh, yeah!

551
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,731
We are in a dream.

552
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,858
La, la-la, la-la, la, la.

553
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,443
Okay, everyone!

554
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,404
We're here to release
your imprisoned souls.

555
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,282
What was that?

556
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,661

00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,605
But, boss, it's Freestyle Friday!

600
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,691
Oh. Okay, my bad.

601
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,862
Hey. Yo, SpongeBob? I got to dip.

602
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,781
Y'all got this.

603
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,991
Bring the prisoners to my office.

604
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,161
Huh. What'd that guy mean by prisoners?

605
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:56,260
So, you dare to enter
the ghost town of the damned,

606
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,596
barge into my demon's lair…

607
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,766
telling my zombies…

608
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,476
that you're gonna free their souls…

609
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,979
like it ain't no thing!

610
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,192
Well, uh, Mr. Diablo,
the good thing is we're in a dream.

611
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,153
- A shared dream.
- Right, a shared dream.

612
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,156
So there's no need to get
all bent out of shape about it.

613
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,408
- It's not real!
- 'Cause it's a dream.

614
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,829
Who told you that?
That crazy bush guy?

615
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,540
- Uh…
- Maybe.

616
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,918
What he should've told you was
it's not a dream!

617
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,340
He might be right, Patrick.
That felt pretty real.

618
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,259
Yeah, that really hurt.

619
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,847
Run!

620
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,146
Hang on, Patrick.

621
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,606
Foul demon, be gone!

622
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,569
What the heck is that?

623
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,612
Huh?

624
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,823
What do I look like, a parking meter?

625
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,700
But Sage said...

626
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,263
Coin laundry's right down the street.

627
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,371
That's pathetic!

628
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,420
Get away from those curtains!

629
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,464
- What? These curtains?
- Oh, these are nice curtains.

630
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,550
Oh, they are. So soft.

631
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,845
That's weird.

632
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,055
These curtains are making a strange sound.

633
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,143
I think the curtain rod needs some oil.

634
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,687
Once the rod goes,
you're probably better off

635
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,272
getting a whole new set of curtains.

636
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,316
Oh, Mr. Diablo,
do you have any other cur...

637
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,734
Oh!

638
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,739
Patrick, I think we should
get out of here!

639
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:45,870
Hey, everybody!

640
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,414
El Diablo says he doesn't want
to be disturbed.

641
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,958
Yeah, he's feeling a little burnt…

642
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,878
- …out.
- Toodle-oo!

643
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,171
- Buh-bye!
- See you!

644
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,254
Take care!

645
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,216
Thank ye, SpongeBob.

646
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,301
We're finally free!

647
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,384
Huh?

648
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,137
Adiós, mateys!

649
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,306
- Thanks, SpongeBob.
- We're finally free.

650
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,308
Good luck on your journey, boys.

651
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,651
Do you know what this means?

652
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,694
We passed the challenge!

653
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,572
Now we can find Gary! Yay!

Howdy, partners.

658
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,922
Wait! Can't forget the "courage."

659
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,384
- It's him!
- Yikes!

660
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,885
Come on, Otto. Let's go!

661
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,055
Come on, come on, Otto!

662
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,766
- Step on it, Otto! Go! Go!
- Faster! Go faster!

663
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,060
Go, Otto, go!

666
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,941
Wake up. Your dream is fired.

667
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,361
- Faster
-Huh? Oh!

668
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,780
Phew! We're back on the bottom.

669
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,116
See, Patrick?
It must have been a dream.

670
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,493
More of a vision really.

671
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,080
- Sage?
- Oh. Hi, Sage.

672
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,873
- Hello.
- You are real.

673
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,335
As real as your desire
to see that which you cannot.

674
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,380
Yeah, well, that which
I cannot see is Gary.

675
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,049
I got to know what's happening.

676
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,884
This wish I grant you.

677
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,348
Through the mystical fabric
of the fourth dimension,

678
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,058
you may now view what's happening

679
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,936
at the same time as things
are happening to you.

680
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,523
Behold. The Window of Meanwhile.

681
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,443
The Window of Meanwhile!

682
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,861
What's it do?

683
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:45,948
It's like the Video On Demand
service of parallel action.

684
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,033
Have a look.

685
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,244
- Whoa…
- Hey, Patrick. Down in front.

686
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,416
Look, Patrick, there he is!

687
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,084
Yeah, he looks all right.

688
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,169
Hey, Gary!

689
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,479
He doesn't look so bad.

690
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,172
He looks pretty comfy!

691
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,674
- No reason to panic.
- Yeah!

692
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,152
He looks like he's well taken care of.

693
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,803
Look what I found. Snail time.

694
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,407
Hello, precious.

695
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,806
Gary?

696
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,852
I hope you don't run out of juice,
or you'll end up like the others.

697
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:15,978
What?!

698
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,285
Oh, yes.

699
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,121
- Gary! Gary, hello?
- Gary!

700
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,333
Okay, the Window of Meanwhile
doesn't really work that way.

701
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,086
- Gary, run! Get out of there!
- Gary!

702
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,756
It's not a video chat app like
Skype or FaceTime, or anything.

703
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,384
- We got to hurry! Gary!
- Over here! Gary!

704
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,345
Totally can't hear you.

705
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,428
Hello!

706
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,649
Hello, Eugene, old friend!

707
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,401
How's business?

708
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,280
Bad? Good.

709
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,282
Well, that's restaurants for you, huh?

710
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,743
Feast or famine.

711
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,869
But I digress.

712
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:18,165
Why don't you be a good little loser
and hand over the secret formula?

713
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,137
Take it. It's yours.

714
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,763
Wha…

715
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,392
Take it all.

716
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,769
Wait…

717
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,021
You're giving up?

718
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,857
Oh, Plankton…

719
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,609
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

720
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,737
But somehow, without SpongeBob,

721
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,489
this whole thing…

722
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,617
just doesn't make sense anymore!

723
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,038
You can't do that.

724
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,791
I've spent my entire career
waiting for this moment

725
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,544
and you roll over like a harpooned whale?

726
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,005
I won't let you rob me of my vengeance!

727
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,717
Give my regards to your lovely wife.

728
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,431
Huh.

729
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,017
This doesn't, uh…

730
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,020
feel quite as good as, uh…

731
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,106
Yay, I won.

732
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,360
Congratulations.

733
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,070
You have arrived at your destination.

734
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,657
The Lost City of Atlantic City!

735
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,621
It's pretty.

736
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,916
Beware, young seekers.

737
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,168
All is distortion.

738
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,420
If you aren't careful,
The Lost City will draw you

739
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,589
into her fickle embrace,

740
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,799
blind you with her dazzling distractions

741
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,677
and tempt you with her
fleeting games of chance.

742
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,639
Whatever you do, don't be led astray,

743
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:01,769
don't lose focus
and don't forget why you came here.

744
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,249
- Don't forget. Good one.
- Thanks, Sage-meister.

745
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,025
- I think we got this.
- Yeah, Sage.

746
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,110
I mean, you've been pretty good
up until now, but,

747
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:15,574
I love Gary more than anything
in the whole world!

748
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,201
And we came here to get him back.

749
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,160
Okay.

750
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,829
I wouldn't worry about us
losing any focus.

751
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,665
Oh, boy.

752
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,500
We got focus to burn, baby...

753
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,254
Whoa!

754
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,050
- Cotton candy!
- Ice cream!

755
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,469
Churros!

756
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,226
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Yay!

757
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,271
Yumm!

758
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,575
What's up?

759
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,371
Isn't it cool how they let you
trade in your real money

760
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,998
for these little plastic circles?

761
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,833
I love money!

762
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,502
Casinos are magical.

763
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,146
Would you mind if I put this down, sir?

764
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,505
Place it wherever you like.

765
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,965
Just put it on L.

766
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,609
Patrick, that's not an L, that's a seven.

767
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,386
Seven starts with an L?
That's weird.

768
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,101
Seven!

769
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,103
More plastic circles!

770
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,857

00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,939
- Hey, Patrick!
- What's up, Spongey-Dawg?

781
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,484
- I lost all my money.
- Me, too!

782
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,612
Party people!

783
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,492
Oh. Where is everybody?

784
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,788
I feel like I swallowed a sea urchin.

785
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,706
Me, too.

786
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,042
Hey, I did swallow a sea urchin!

787
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,961
Well, well, well.

788
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,548
Sagester! Good to see ya, pal!

789
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,299
Nice work, boys.

790
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,095
Way to take my pearls of wisdom
and flush them down the toilet.

791
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,556
Oh, no. Wait, did we…?

792
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,225
Lose focus like I told you not to?

793
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,061
Focus? Huh.

794
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,063
Let me jangle your minds.

795
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,941
You came here to get back
something you lost.

796
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,068
- Uh…
- Hm.

797
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,821
Something you love.

798
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,031
Gary!

799
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,159
Yeah, Gary.

800
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,537
Seriously, it's hard enough
being stuck in a tumbleweed…

801
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,289
Patrick, we got to find Gary!

802
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,333
…but dealing with you two makes me
want to light myself on fire.

803
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,710
Sage, buddy.

804
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,670
Can we please look into
the Window of Meanwhile

805
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:59,131
one more time to see where Gary is?

806
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,675
No, it's not an on-demand service.

807
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:05,512
And especially not for people who pass out
and sleep in their own vomit all night.

808
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,975
It's not vomit. It's drool.

809
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,355
Fortunately for you,
you woke up right here.

810
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,649
On the steps of Poseidon's Palace.

811
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,736
- Whoa.
- Wow.

812
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,155
Now get it together. Go!

813
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,617
All right, Gary. We're coming for ya!

814
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,205
Boy, oh, boy. Hey…

815
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,706
Almost there, Gary.

816
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,422
Hey, hop on!

817
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,133
They're just giving these things
away at the grocery store.

818
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,426
Good call, buddy.

819
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,678
Hot stuff coming through!

820
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,097
Get a load of this place, Patrick.

821
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,392
Hello.

822
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,103
We would like an audience
with His Majesty King Poseidon.

823
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:59,858
Oh, sure. Let me check.
Two rubes to see Poseidon. No.

824
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,363
Hey, dude. We're the Blue Fin Group.

825
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,781
Of course. Right this...

826
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,536
The Blue Fin Group! No!

827
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,703
Hey!

828
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,796
Hey, hey, hey!

829
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,507
I'm Tiffany Haddock
and I'm here just for the halibut.

830
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,050
Ha-ha-ha!

831
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,843
Whoo-hoo!

832
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:27,927
All right then.

833
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,639
Our next performers are gonna knock...

834
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,980
Poseidon?

835
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:41,066
We are getting an audience with the King.

836
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:45,737
Well, let's have it. Perform, please!

837
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,741
♪ Hey! Aka Waka Maka Mia ♪

838
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,368
♪ Was a puffer fish ♪

839
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,746
♪ Being bigger than a puffer
Was his only wish ♪

840
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,790
♪ And so he huffed, he puffed ♪

841
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,593
♪ He billowed and he blew ♪

842
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,420
Gary!

843
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,257
Gary, I'm coming, buddy!

844
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,679
Excuse me. Sorry. My bad. Whoop.

845
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,723
Sorry. Whoa!

846
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,436
Hi, there! Excuse me, King Poseidon, sire.

847
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,688
There's been a misunderstanding
about Gary.

848
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,772
Gary?

849
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,190
- Gary.
- Gary?

850
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,294
The snail that you're rubbing
all over your face right now.

851
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,154
Nonsense. Besides,
this snail's name is Fred.

852
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,323
"Fred?" You renamed Gary?

853
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,657
- Fred.
- Gary.

854
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,619
- Fred! Fred!
- Gary! Gary!

855
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,120
- Fred!
- Gary!

856
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,204
Fred!

857
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,499
Seize them!

858
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,667
Gary!

859
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,377
Gary!

860
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,255
But Gary loves me! And I love him.

861
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,889
Yeehaw!

862
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,935
Incoming!

863
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,566
Whoa!

864
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,487
Good rockets.

865
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,989
SpongeBob?

866
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,116
Get yer co-pilot goggles, dude,

867
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,743
'cause we're goin' sleddin'!

868
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,578
SpongeBob?

869
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,749
You in here?

870
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,001
SpongeBob?

871
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,714
SpongeBob!

872
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,841
Huh. That's weird.

873
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,469
Something's fishy around here.

874
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,109
All right, what'd y'all do with SpongeBob?

875
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,111
We don't know where he is, Sandy.

876
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,987
Hasn't been here in days.

877
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,824
Don't you play coy with me, cephalopod.

878
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,826
And you, arthropod!

879
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,661
Start talking. Where is he?

880
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,205
Tied up in the basement?
Stuffed in your trunk?

881
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,791
Nay, I could never harm the lad.

882
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,793
His absence has taught me that much.

883
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,088
And I'm not just talking about
the money I'm losing with him gone.

884
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,715
Hmm…

885
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,677
Okay, fifty percent
talking about the money

886
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,179
and fifty percent talking about
I truly miss the boy.

887
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,556
Aw.

888
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:21,601
I hate to admit it, but things
just aren't the same without him.

889
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:25,355
There's no denying it. We need SpongeBob.

890
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,442
Did anyone ever stop to think
that he might need us?

891
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,195
This is Perch Perkins coming to you
from The Lost City of Atlantic City.

892
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,864
I'm standing on the strip outside

893
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,616
Poseidon's Palace and Casino,
where two suspects have been

894
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,452
taken into custody tonight…

895
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,871
…following an attempt on the Royal Snail.

896
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,874
The sponge and sea star were
impersonating a lounge act

897
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,043
when they made an attempt
on Poseidon's prize mollusk.

898
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,005
It's Gary!

899
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,091
The suspects' vehicle was apprehended
after a high-speed chase.

900
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,261
Mr. Krabs. What happened to Otto?

901
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:59,681
Well, he took an automated vacation!

902
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,475
In a related story, Poseidon's Palace

903
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,186
presents a command performance,
featuring the execution

904
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,689
of the suspects in the Aqua Room
this Friday night.

905
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,400
Execution of the suspects?

906
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,486
What happened to habeas swordfish?

907
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,947
It's a fun-filled family event,
with opening act Kelpy G.

908
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,991
One performance only,
tickets still available.

909
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,037
- We've got to go help them!
- We embark immediately.

910
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,164
Excuse me.

911
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,041
Can I tag along?

912
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,167
Plankton?

913
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,377
What have you got to do with this?

914
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,087
I… I…

915
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,549
I might have had a teensy-weensy
hand in a very...

916
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,760
Yeah, yeah,
we'll hear about it in the car.

917
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,595
Mr. Squidward, are ya coming?

918
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,806
Ha! Fat chance.

919
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:45,227
Fat chance I'd miss
a Kelpy G performance. I'm in.

920
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,479
To the Pattymobile!

921
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,115
What, this old tub?

922
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,743
Never judge a Pattymobile
by its bun, Squidward.

923
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,635
Let's light this puppy!

924
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,937
Yeehaw!

925
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:34,067
Mommy!

926
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,063
Huh? SpongeBob?

927
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,315
Are you okay?

928
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,402
Hey, buddy. Sorry about this.

929
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,030
It's not your fault, Patrick.

930
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,824
You've been a true friend this whole time.

931
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,202
Never wavered, never faltered. It's just…

932
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,413
I failed, that's all!

933
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:32,000
And I'll never see
innocent little Gary again.

934
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,711
Oh, my heart is broken!

935
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,380
Oh, come on now.

936
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,467
Buck up. It's not over yet, SpongeBob.

937
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:44,012
It sure feels over. And crappy.

938
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,848
Just saying there's
two sides to every coin.

939
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,808
Oh, Patrick, what does a coin have to...

940
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,685
Wait, did you just say "coin"?

941
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,812
Me? Uh, don't think so.

942
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,650
You did. You said "coin"!

943
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,819
Not remembering that exactly.

944
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,989
- Hello?
- The challenge coin! Of course!

945
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,951
Oh, don't you see, Patrick? We're saved!

946
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,577
I said hello.

947
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,997
Patrick, it's gone!

948
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,417
Meh. Was the challenge coin
really that useful?

949
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,835
Hello?

950
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,506
Oh! Stupid prank callers.

951
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,132
Hey, wait a sec.

952
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,094
I gave it to you, remember?
For safe keeping.

953
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,303
No.

954
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,556
Come on, it was last night!
We were at the crappie tables.

955
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,810
Winner! Place your bets.

956
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:35,730
Come on, seven! Come on, seven!
Come on, seven!

957
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,526
You!

958
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,987
You gambled away my challenge coin!

959
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,240
You wrecked our entire mission
with one stupid bet!

960
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,325
Well, only after you kept saying…

961
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:51,079
Let it ride, Patrick! Let it ride!

962
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,789
- Whoo!
- But, SpongeBob…

963
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,916
What if you need
the challenge coin tomorrow

964
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,210
to help you summon your courage?

965
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,212
Tomorrow is for weenies!

966
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:03,091
Whoo!

967
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,761
Well, it's tomorrow and guess
who's the weenie.

968
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,057
I… can't…

969
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,059
believe you!

970
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,813
You can't believe me?
Are you serious right now?

971
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,315
Well! Maybe you can believe this.

972
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,817
I'm out of here!

973
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,784
And don't come back!

974
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,454
Oh, don't worry, I won't!

975
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,289
- Good!
- Ever!

976
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,124
- Fine!
- Super!

977
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:38,918
Hey, losers.

978
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,629
Oh, hey, Sage.

979
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,964
Sage, glad you're here.

980
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,508
Guess who gambled away my challenge coin.

981
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,844
Guess who blames everyone else
for his troubles.

982
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:48,927
Enough!

983
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,806
Did I mention you are
the worst epic heroes

984
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,184
for whom I have ever been a spirit guide?

985
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,311
Um, I think we went over that
this morning.

986
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,812
I believe we did, yeah.

987
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,693
SpongeBob, the coin was just a symbol.

988
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,820
The courage you seek is inside you,

989
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,113
not in the coin.

990
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,574
And it will come to you
in your hour of need.

991
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:12,243
But isn't this my hour of need?

992
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,871
Oh, no.

993
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,207
It gets way worse.

994
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,708
Bye!

995
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:22,128
- Worse?
- Dude said way worse.

996
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,841
Prepare the prisoners.

997
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,259
Oh, that couldn't be for us.

998
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,304
It's your big moment to fry…
I mean, shine.

999
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:34,557
It is for us, Patrick!
We're gonna die!

1000
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,478
And that's how I got SpongeBob

1001
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,814
out of Bikini Bottom.

1002
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,525
- Why, that's monstrous!
- Wait, that sounds good.

1003
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,361
- Oh, brother.
- What do you expect? I'm evil.

1004
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,154
Let's just focus on the plan.

1005
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,991
We're approaching
The Lost City of Atlantic City.

1006
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,869
Make way there, make way!

1007
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,998
Oh!

1008
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,959
Eww.

1009
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:05,380
"Sponge and Star Execution Extravaganza"?

1010
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,298
No time to lose!

1011
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,637
Woop, woop, woop! Ladies and gentlefish,

1012
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,098
welcome to the Aqua Room, y'all.

1013
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,892
The greatest show underwater.

1014
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,788
My groupies and groupers…

1015
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,190
- We love you, Tiffany!
- Yeah holler at your girl!

1016
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,900
Are you ready to be entertained?

1017
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,569
Hmm? I can't hear you.

1018
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,113
Are you ready to be entertained?

1019
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:35,243
All right, then,
let's meet the contestants.

1020
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,621
In this corner, a sponge and a star…

1021
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,458
…two of the ocean's
most notorious criminals!

1022
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:47,797
And in this corner,
representing His Majesty the King,

1023
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:52,051
Poseidon's very own Chancellor!

1024
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,388
Now drum roll, maestro.

1025
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,307
Put your fins together

1026
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,225
for the duke of the dirty deed,

1027
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,352
the earl of execution,

1028
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,563
that axe-wielding maniac…

1029
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,817
…oh, yeah, Lemont!

1030
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,445
Lamont! Lamont! Lamont!

1031
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,656
Oh, I love me some Lemont.

1032
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,742
Mm, mm, mm. He's so strong.

1033
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,833
Ladies and gentlemen,

1034
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,044
with a moment of smooth jazz

1035
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,421
in memory of the soon-to-be-goners,

1036
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,049
I give you Kelpy G.

1037
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,520
Oh, Patrick, I feel terrible.

1038
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,396
I dragged you into this whole mess.

1039
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,232
It's okay, SpongeBob.

1040
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,443
I made a plea deal with the prosecution!

1041
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,322
Oh, that's good... Wait, you did what?

1042
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,616
All I have to do is, uh… oh, yeah!

1043
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,994
"Bring incriminating evidence
against the defendant."

1044
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,747
Patrick, I'm the defendant.

1045
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,124
You are? Oh.

1046
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,971
Let the proceedings begin!

1047
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,933
Your Honor, I would like
to enter into evidence

1048
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:25,019
Fred.

1049
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:30,191
- Gary!
- How dare you!

1050
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,610
That's about all I can say.

1051
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,154
How dare you come here

1052
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,825
to the sanctuary of our revered sovereign,

1053
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:42,954
to rob him of his very lifeblood,

1054
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,622
his adorable good looks.

1055
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,916
Go on.

1056
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,253
How indeed dare you.

1057
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,381
Guilty!

1058
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:57,802
Lemont! Lemont! Lemont!

1059
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,187
Hold it!

1060
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,441
If it please the court,

1061
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,568
I'd like to say something
in SpongeBob's defense.

1062
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,069
It does not please the court.

1063
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,822
Sit down, squirrel with fishbowl on head.

1064
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:21,909
But, sire, a strong defense
makes for a better show.

1065
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,453
Isn't that right, audience?

1066
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:30,418
All right, all right! I'll allow it.

1067
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,670
Thank you, Your Honor.

1068
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,255
Ladies and gentlemen,

1069
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,300
SpongeBob has always been there for me.

1070
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,677
Even going all the way back
to summer camp.

1071
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,889
In fact, that's where we all met.

1072
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,780
I'm…

1073
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:01,491
Ow! Ah! Ooh! Ooh!

1074
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,373
Ready!

1075
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,546
Look at all the cool activities!

1076
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,840
Camping. Canoeing.

1077
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,592
Seahorse-back riding!

1078
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,053
Tug-of-war. Whale watching.

1079
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,221
Do you mind?

1080
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:26,140
Juggling contests. Shrink-wrap soccer!

1081
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,351
And more.

1082
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,688
Whoo-hoo!

1083
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,189
Whoa!

1084
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:37,485
Hey, y'all critters of the sea!
Look out below!

1085
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,407
I'm Sandy Cheeks from Texas.

1086
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,242
Hi, Sandy. I'm SpongeBob.

1087
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,785
Pleased to meet ya.

1088
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,287
Does everybody wear spacesuits in Texas?

1089
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,207
They do if they want to visit
you underwater critters.

1090
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,000
We all breathe air on the surface.

1091
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,878
It's just our way of synthesizing oxygen.

1092
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,630
Same as you do with water.

1093
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:01,342
Whoa. Are you a scientist?

1094
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,886
Naw, I'm just a squirrel.

1095
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,930
I can't be a scientist.

1096
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,266
Even though it's kind of my dream.

1097
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,351
Sandy Cheeks, you take that back!

1098
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,645
I bet you can do anything.

1099
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,939
Really? Wow.

1100
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:17,316
Me a scientist?

1101
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,280
Science.

1102
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:27,243
You're a hoot, little dude.

1103
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,162
I'd be just as likely to live down here

1104
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,497
in a glass dome with a tree in it.

1105
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,416
- Ha-ha!
- You never know!

1106
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,210
Ow.

1107
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,838
Ow.

1108
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,430
He's the one that told me,

1109
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:51,100
no matter who I was or where I came from,

1110
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,436
I should follow my dream.

1111
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,855
That's a friend, people.

1112
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,857
And that's why, in my eyes…

1113
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,194
SpongeBob is no criminal.

1114
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,529
He's the best little fella

1115
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,990
to ever walk the sea bottom. And that's…

1116
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:09,368
That's just how I feel about it. So…

1117
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,704
Please, don't hurt him.

1118
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,665
Aww…

1119
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,085
This man broke the law!

1120
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,966
"You should stay home

1121
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:27,220
and accept the fact
that somebody stole your snail."

1122
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:32,934
"There's probably
nothing I can do about it."

1123
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,229
Well, in this sea star's opinion,

1124
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:41,442
those laws should be broken
and SpongeBob is proof of it!

1125
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,861
All he's guilty of

1126
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:48,699
is having the fortitude
to try and rescue a friend.

1127
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,203
How do I know?

1128
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:55,456
Oh, I was just a lonely bump on a log

1129
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,166
when I first met him.

1130
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,843
Hi, my name...

1131
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,304
Hi, my name...

1132
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,392
Hello my name is SpongeBob,
what's your name?

1133
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:18,312
I'm Pa-Pa-Patrick.

1134
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,817
Why are you crying, Pa-Pa-Patrick?

1135
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,111
I'm homesick.

1136
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:29,031
Well, that's a pretty good reason.

1137
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,119
Maybe all you need is a friend.

1138
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,955
I don't have any friends!

1139
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,499
- Well, you've got one now.
- Really?

1140
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,669
- Who is it?
- It's me!

1141
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:45,089
- Do you mean it?
- Of course. Come on!

1142
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,136
That sweet little sponge

1143
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,598
rescued this miserable little sea star.

1144
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:57,226
And things haven't changed
that much today, Your Honor.

1145
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,610
My heart, buddy.

1146
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:13,075
I don't like SpongeBob.

1147
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,412
In fact, I revile him.

1148
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,623
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1149
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:25,504
Anyway, I, too, met this nabob
in summer camp.

1150
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,673
I remember it like it was yesterday.

1151
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,550
It was my big night.

1152
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,470
The Annual Camp Coral Talent Show.

1153
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,351
And first prize was the coveted
Campy Award.

1154
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,019
Thank you, Larry.

1155
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,229
Remember, people, don't forget to vote.

1156
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,528
As far as I was concerned,

1157
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:52,031
the trophy was as good as mine.

1158
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,241
- Hey, Squidward...
- Bup, bup, bup, bup.

1159
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:57,036
Quiet. I'm in pregame right now.

1160
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,748
I've got an award to win.

1161
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,298
♪ La, la-la-la, loo! ♪

1162
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,216
♪ La-la ♪

1163
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,802
♪ Aka Waka Maka Mia
Was a puffer fish ♪

1164
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:17,473
The Campy is mine.

1165
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,355
I bathed the audience

1166
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:27,525
with the sounds of my
heavenly clarinet playing.

1167
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,456
Thank you, Squidward. Just lovely.

1168
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,083
Thank you, thank you.

1169
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,296
And the Campy goes to…

1170
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:50,649
I'll take that.

1171
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,758
- …SpongeBob and Patrick!
- Huh?

1172
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:56,929
No! No! No!

1173
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,057
This isn't happening!

1174
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,435
No! Mommy!

1175
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,520
I was robbed.

1176
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:07,815
And never to play the clarinet again.

1177
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,112
No…

1178
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,788
- Squidward!
- Go away!

1179
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,584
Patrick and I were, um,

1180
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:29,378
talking to one of the counselors
and guess what?

1181
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:33,215
There was a big mistake and you
actually won the Campy Award!

1182
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,842
That's right. Yup.

1183
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,596
- I… I did?
- In a landslide.

1184
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,431
Hmm.

1185
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:42,975
So weird they would've
miscounted like that.

1186
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,603
- But I guess it's possible...
- Yay!

1187
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:48,981
- Nice work, Squidward.
- No one deserves it more.

1188
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,357
Wow.

1189
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,860
And don't ever stop playing this.

1190
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,403
My clarinet.

1191
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,947
Look at me. I really did it!

1192
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,783
Yay!

1193
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,996
Which is why, even though
I can't stand SpongeBob…

1194
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,249
but at the same time, well…

1195
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,375
I love him.

1196
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:09,668
I love him

1197
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,253
- and I hate him.
- Oh.

1198
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,631
He's like ice cream with salt on it,

1199
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:16,759
because he's sweet and super annoying.

1200
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,302
He's nice and

1201
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,721
nails-on-chalkboard annoying!

1202
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,724
Okay, fine, he's mostly
super freaking annoying.

1203
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:27,269
But, this little nattering noodge…

1204
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,563
is my friend.

1205
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,108
And he doesn't deserve to die.

1206
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,577
I'll be saying my piece now,
if it be pleasing the court.

1207
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,789
I suppose I could stand up here

1208
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:49,875
and tell you how
SpongeBob changed me life.

1209
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,544
But, I won't.

1210
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,922
I might even speak
about how he inspired me

1211
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:59,385
when I was just a small-time vendor
with a broken-down luncheonette.

1212
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,679
But I won't.

1213
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:04,348
Heck, I'd probably mention
how he encouraged me

1214
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,100
to start up me own restaurant.

1215
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,063
You should open up
your own restaurant, someday.

1216
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:12,648
The Krusty Krab, made famous
by me delicious Krabby Patties!

1217
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,192
Two-for-one Wednesdays,
by the way. Pass these around.

1218
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:17,653
But, I won't.

1219
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,574
Nay, you'll hear none such praise from me.

1220
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,243
Because it wouldn't do him full justice.

1221
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,164
It wouldn't begin to describe
the size of the lad's heart.

1222
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:31,458
Which is huge.

1223
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,883
And he puts that heart
into everything he does.

1224
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,050
The cooking…

1225
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,011
- Order up!
- …cleaning…

1226
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,055
…serving up the delicious
Krabby Patties.

1227
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,057
But that's the funny thing.

1228
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,728
I used to think
me secret Krabby Patty formula

1229
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,272
was also the secret to me success.

1230
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,442
We serve breakfast till 11,
by the way, 12 on weekends.

1231
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:00,070
It wasn't until SpongeBob
came to work for me

1232
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:02,573
that I realized the formula

1233
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,075
is more than just a list of ingredients

1234
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,911
and flavor-capturing methods.

1235
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:10,372
It's more than a jealously
guarded recipe.

1236
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,375
The real secret formula

1237
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,503
is sitting right here.

1238
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,049
SpongeBob SquarePants.

1239
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,135
Aww…

1240
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,471
Get ready.

1241
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,181

Wow.

Free food!

01:12:58,832 --> 01:12:59,832
Get him!

1288
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,342
Come on, come on. In here!

1289
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,802
Stop right there!

1290
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,846
Inside! Quick!

1291
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:21,939
Come on!

1292
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,066
Uh-oh.

1293
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,819
Push! Push, Plankton!

1294
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,570
You got to be kidding me!

1295
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:30,864
Hah!

1296
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:51,844
Hmm?

1297
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,724
Peekaboo!

1298
01:13:57,891 --> 01:13:59,518
Attack!

1299
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,606
Ha-hah!

1300
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:05,941
Attack!

1301
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:09,153
Whoa!
Watch your left flank, people!

1302
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,113
Thrust! Now parry!

1303
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:13,615
Now pirouette.
Turn around. Pivot!

1304
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:17,244
Pull harder. Faster!
To the right!

1305
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:19,830
Hi-ya!

1306
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,959
Whoa, whoa!

1307
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:44,605
Do you think we should've
stayed in there with Squidward?

1308
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:46,523
Nah, he's got it.

1309
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,400
Where is everybody?!

1310
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,776
Charge!

1311
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,905
Whoa!

1312
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,704
Squidward!

1313
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,756
Squidward! Fall this way!

1314
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,216
No, this way!

1315
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,217
Oh.

1316
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,472
Man down.

1317
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,309
Good catch.

1318
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:24,978
- Hey, there they are!
- Get them!

1319
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,188
Yo, what's up?

1320
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:27,689
Otto!

1321
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,775
I have a gambling problem.

1322
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,362
Otto!

1323
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:35,781
Could anyone lend me some money?

1324
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,200
To Bikini Bottom!
And step on it!

1325
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:39,743
Stepping on it.

1326
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,204
You're all fired.

1327
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:44,248
To the valet!

1328
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,959
Ah!

1329
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:50,546
Leaving so soon, kids?

1330
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,049
Hang on, Gary.
I won't let you go.

1331
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:57,261
Tsk, tsk. Rather impolite,
don't you think?

1332
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:58,929
It was all their idea, sire.

1333
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,722
And I…

1334
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,141
…loved it!

1335
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,102
Wait, so you're not mad at us?

1336
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:06,353
No!

1337
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,063
It's been a while since I've enjoyed

1338
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:10,232
such toe-tapping entertainment.

1339
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:11,733
All is forgiven!

1340
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,403
- And all charges are dropped.
- Hooray!

1341
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:16,363
On one condition.

1342
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:19,491
SpongeBob will return my snail to me

1343
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,952
without any more shilly-shally.

1344
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:23,412
Wait, what?

1345
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:26,498
Just hand over the snail
and you can all go free.

1346
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,962
But… I… I…

1347
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,630
SpongeBob.

1348
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,300
Sage? Is that you?

1349
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:37,467
Hello.

1350
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,136
Sage! Hi!

1351
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,304
Remember…

1352
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,306
The courage you seek
is inside you.

1353
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:45,183
And it will come to you
in your hour of need.

1354
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,771
The courage is inside me.

1355
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,609
The courage is inside me!

1356
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,070
Mr. Poseidon, no.

1357
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:59,031
I'm sorry, but I won't do it.

1358
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:01,908
What?

1359
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,494
I love Gary too much,
and he loves me.

1360
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,789
If we didn't have each other,
we'd be so sad. Well…

1361
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,083
It wouldn't really matter
what you'd do to us.

1362
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:15,213
And look. Today, thanks to these
amazing friends,

1363
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,800
my heart feels twice as big
a s it ever did.

1364
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:21,720
Especially after what they risked for me:

1365
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,973
Flouting the law and defying
the mighty king of the sea.

1366
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,809
Defying? Really?

1367
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,354
I wouldn't say defying the king.

1368
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,648
Humiliating you in front of your subjects.

1369
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,816
- Do go on.
- More like admiring.

1370
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,401
And totally agreeing with!

1371
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,195
I just came to see Kelpy G.

1372
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,197
And they did it all for me.

1373
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,283
I'm sure you'd understand
if you had friends like these.

1374
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:46,828
Friends like these?
Wait, what?

1375
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:48,872
Friends like these?

1376
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,792
Of course I have
friends like these.

1377
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,460
I have all kinds of friends!

1378
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:56,505
I have buddies, I have besties.

1379
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,883
I have home-slices, palsy-walsies.

1380
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,468
It's infinite!

1381
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:03,512
Chancellor! Give us an exact number.

1382
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:05,097
The friend count, if you will.

1383
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,600
Uh, okay,
according to your latest polling data,

1384
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:11,103
we should get more polling data.

1385
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,187
What? Give me that.

1386
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,814
Huh?

1387
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:15,232
What about my adoring fans?

1388
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:18,860
- Nope.
- My elite palace guards?

1389
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,046
Mm-mm.

1390
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:22,489
- What about my personal trainer?
- Mmm… Mm-mm.

1391
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,325
- My therapist?
- Nada.

1392
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,077
- My tattoo artist?
- Uh…nope.

1393
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,454
- My tattoo removal artist?
- No dice.

1394
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,958
B-But surely you, my chancellor,

1395
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,127
my loyal faithful…?

1396
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,336
Sorry.

1397
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,305
Apollo, take me now.

1398
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:50,934
I don't have any friends!

1399
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:56,690
Well, you got one now!

1400
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,485
Really? Who is it?

1401
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,487
It's me! I'll be your friend.

1402
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:04,656
Do you mean it?

1403
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:08,368
Yes. But friends don't kidnap
friends' pet snails.

1404
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,495
But I need that snail.

1405
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,874
Look, I have a horrible,
disgusting wrinkle.

1406
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:16,585
Jumping jellyfish,
it's the size of the Mariana Trench!

1407
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:18,920
Kidding!

1408
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,255
Looks don't matter.

1409
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:22,507
We don't care about little imperfections.

1410
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,925
Or even big ones!

1411
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,386
- Just look at Squidward.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1412
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,472
What's important is what's inside.

1413
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,724
And I'm sure you can be
a fair and kind king

1414
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:32,601
to all the creatures of the sea.

1415
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,519
I know you've got it in you, sir.

1416
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:37,230
If you'd just let your hair down a little.

1417
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:40,859
Huh? My hair? Wait a minute.

1418
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,195
Are you suggesting that I don't need this

1419
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,322
gorgeous mane of wavy locks?

1420
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,409
That I don't require this neck clip?

1421
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:56,416
Be gone, perfect shiny teeth!

1422
01:19:58,001 --> 01:19:59,294
This is so freeing!

1423
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:01,713
To heck with this chest plate and girdle.

1424
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:05,175
- Oh, wow.
- Too far?

1425
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:06,760
No! Not at all!

1426
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:08,845
No, you look great!

1427
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:13,558
Oh, thank you!
I find this so exhilarating.

1428
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,477
So… age appropriate.

1429
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:18,563
SpongeBob, few possess the courage

1430
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,607
to stand up to a powerful king.

1431
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:24,945
You, sir, are among those few.
I salute you.

1432
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:26,905
Nailed it, SpongeBob.

1433
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:28,782
Sage out.

1434
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,618
You may keep Gary.

1435
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:34,746
And I wish you many happy years together.

1436
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,290
Thank you!
Did you hear that, Gare-Bear?

1437
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,210
Uh, your royal robe, Your Highness.

1438
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:43,088
- It's getting cold out here.
- Nonsense, Chancellor.

1439
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:44,548
I'm free!

1440
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,550
Ooh, you certainly are.

1441
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,844
And free the snails!

1442
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:55,432
What's that?

1443
01:20:58,353 --> 01:20:59,604
All of them?

1444
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,405
I'm home!

1445
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:11,156
Hello, Gary.

1446
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,118
Hello, Brian.

1447
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:19,708
Hello, Janet. Hello, June.
Hola, Lupe.

1448
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,587
- Morning, Sally!
- Hi, Brett!

1449
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,564
Come on, Gary! You can do it!

1450
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:46,776
Yeah!

1451
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,368
Fabio! Where are you, buddy?

1452
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,495
Here, Fabio, Fabio, Fabio!

1453
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,959
Come on, Fifi. No.

1454
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:24,898
Order up!
