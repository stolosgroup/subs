2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So I guess this is it.

3
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,999
Yeah.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,999
I guess so.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, do you guys have to go to the new house right away

6
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,000
or do you have some time?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,999
We got some time.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, should we get some coffee?

9
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,000
Sure.

10
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:48,000
Where?

11
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,999
Wow.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wow.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,999
I mean, this is beautiful.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's beautiful. Look at that.

15
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:25,999
Oh, man.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,999
So many... So many different episodes are like

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
you know, Lisa playing guitar up there,

18
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:33,999
Jen and I, our first kiss,

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
like, the pilot, opening the umbrella.

20
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:40,000
I mean, come on.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,999
Yeah.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,999
Where is everyone?

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Come on, I want to see everyone.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, my God.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,999
Oh!

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,999
That "Oh!"

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is all I care about.

28
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,000
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,999
Oh, my God.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hello. Oh, you smell good, too.

31
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:10,500
Yeah, so do you.

32
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:11,999
Look at that.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Wasn't there a decision to lose this?

34
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:16,999
Yes, I thought this was gone.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,999
This was here in the beginning, and...

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
- It kept, like...
- Got in the way.

37
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:21,999
It got in the way. Yeah.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,999
Sorry, you got lost behind the beam.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
As it's probably getting in the way now.

40
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:27,999
- Well, I don't know.
- Oh.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
- Sometimes it's a choice.
- There we go.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
- Ee, ee, ee.
- How crazy is this?

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,999
I hear someone.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I just started crying.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,999
Floosh!

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,499
Joo!

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,999
It's amazing.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,999
- Hi.
- How are you?

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ooh. Holy crap.

50
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,999
Oh, weird.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Alright, well, where's the tissue box?

52
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,000
Uh-oh.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,079
- Oh!
- Hey!

54
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,160
What are you guys doing here?

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,999
Waiting for you.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, my God. How are you?

57
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,999
Oh, look at you.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
- Look at you.
- Hello. Big blue.

59
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:40,999
This is great.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,499
This is too weird.

61
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,999
Look at this.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Remember when we all used to fit through that door?

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
- Oh.
- I got chills.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's so weird. Walk that way, buddy.

65
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,999
Look at this.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Does Courteney still have her lines written on the table?

67
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,000
Do you know what the difference is?

68
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,999
You know what's nuts? Oh, really?

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,279
I never knew she did that. And I saw it.

70
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,840
I was like, "What is this?" She goes...

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
"Mind your business," she said.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So before we shot that night, I erased it all.

73
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:13,500
- No.
- And she got so mad at me.

74
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:16,999
Or had the script in the sink.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,999
- That I do remember.
- That I remember.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,999
There was always a script in the sink.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
- I didn't know why.
- That was Courteney's script.

78
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,500
Good for her.

79
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:25,999
Oh, my God.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
- Really?
- C.C.!

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
- Did you cry too?
- Yes.

82
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,999
Okay, good.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,999
Of course I did.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How are you? Ohh.

85
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,999
Wow.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,999
I know. It's worse than you imagine.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
- Look at you.
- Oh, you do smell good, Court.

88
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:50,500
- Hi.
- Oh, my gosh. That's crazy.

89
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:53,999
- Do you remember that night?
- What?

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You had... I don't remember what episode it was.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,999
But you had this, like, big speech,

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and you were struggling with it all week long,

93
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:03,999
and you wrote it on the table,

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and then just... and I didn't know that that's what you did.

95
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:07,999
And I saw it and I asked you,

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,999
and you told me to mind my business.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So when you weren't looking, I erased it before we shot.

98
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:14,000
- That's so mean.
- And you got so mad at me.

99
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,000
I didn't know you did that.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why would you erase it?

101
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,999
Just to get you.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,999
God, I had so many...

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,999
so much of my dialogue within these apples.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
- I didn't know.
- Oh, sometimes, yeah.

105
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,000
I have memory issues.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Matthew Perry's here.

107
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:36,000
Hello.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
- Hey, Matt.
- Matty!

109
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,999
Looshy. Hi.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,999
Could you be any later?

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
- Hey.
- How are you, brother?

112
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:44,999
Hey.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
- How are you, bud?
- Good.

114
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:50,999
Look at all of us.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,999
- Oh, my God.
- This is crazy.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Does it seem smaller to anyone else?

117
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,999
From here to over there.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
- Does not feel smaller.
- No.

119
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:57,999
It feels the same to me.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And was it always purple, that wall?

121
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:01,000
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

122
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, you've gone crazy.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,999
I mean, this is incredible.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, it really is. The whole thing.

125
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:06,999
Just really...

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,999
Oh, the one thing missing...

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,999
the original cookie jar is at Lisa Kudrow's house.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Did you take anything from the set besides...

129
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,999
I took a neon coffee mug.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,499
I have the original ball from the foosball table.

131
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,000
You look at it and go, "What is that old, crappy..."

132
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:23,000
Should have taken the whole table.

133
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,000
We smashed it, remember?

134
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:24,999
By the end, it got smashed.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,999
- Oh, it did?
- Then what's that?

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, that was before it got destroyed.

137
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:31,000
We're going back a little further.

138
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:32,999
I need to watch this series.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,640
- It was good.
- I have the original ball.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
- Yeah, yeah.
- It had its moments.

141

The cast of "Friends," everybody.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Might need to squeeze up there.

176
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:50,999
Take a seat.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,499
Look at this. Look at all of you.

178
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,000
Hello.

179
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,999
Hello, James Corden.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I cannot tell you how incredible it is

181
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,999
to be here with all of you now.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And we are... I should say we are shooting now

183
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,000
in front of the iconic fountain

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,999
where you shot the opening credits.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's beautiful and it's lovely.

186
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,999
It is, however, noisy...

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,999
- Yes.
- ...and difficult...

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,499
difficult to conduct an interview.

189
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,749
So if you'll just wait, watch this.

190
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,000
Watch this for power. Wait there.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Done. Okay.

192
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:36,999
That's superpowers.

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
- Alright. I know. I know.
- Those are superpowers.

194
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:40,999
You still got it.

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,999
- I know.
- Had we known

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
all those years ago.

197
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,999
Now, how are we doing?

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This has been an emotional day for all of you.

199
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:54,000
How are you feeling to be together,

200
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,999
the six of you right now?

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,999
It's been so fantastic and exciting.

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And we've literally just sort of slipped right back

203
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,999
right... as we usually do.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,999
David, how have you found this time?

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Really emotional. Really, really fun, actually.

206
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:13,000
I felt, after the initial shock

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,999
of just being in the same room together,

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,999
just I think we all just fell right into our same old...

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,499
our same old kind of joking around like we're a family.

210
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,000
- And so it really was...
- Regressed. We regressed.

211
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,000
- We regressed, yeah.
- Back to 20s.

212
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,999
How much do you stay in touch?

213
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, no, we stay in touch for sure.

214
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:35,999
- Maybe not every day.
- Sure.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But, you know, we have such a bond

216
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:42,999
from having done this show

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and forged this very tight relationship

218
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:47,999
that, you know, any time you text

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,999
or call someone, they're going to pick up.

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
- They'll be there.
- Matthew, who doesn't pick up?

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't hear from anyone.

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,499
Now, I'm going to give you some stats, okay?

223
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,000
So "Friends," you made 236 episodes of the show.

224
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:12,999
It aired in over 220 territories.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
"Friends" was TV's number-one comedy for six straight seasons,

226
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:21,500
averaging 25 million viewers a week.

227
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:24,999
52 million people watched the finale.

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The show has been watched over 100 billion times

229
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,999
across all platforms.

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,499
- And tonight...
- That's a lot.

231
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,000
- That's a lot.
- ...is a real

232
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:38,999
celebration of that.

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And the creators of the show are here tonight

234
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,999
sat in the audience.

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Marta Kauffman, David Crane, Kevin Bright are just sat there.

236
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,000
They created the show.

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,999
I'm the executive producer

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and sometimes director of "Friends."

239
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:04,000
My name is Kevin Bright.

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm co-creator, executive producer,

241
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:09,000
and writer Marta Kauffman.

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm the co-creator and executive producer of "Friends."

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm David Crane.

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Marta and I spent our 20s living in New York.

245
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:25,500
We had a tight circle of friends.

246
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:28,750
There we were in our 20s in New York

247
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,875
trying to make a living and find love.

248
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,999
And we thought that could be a show.

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We drew on relatives of ours and friends of ours

250
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:39,001
and names were...

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,999
We named Chandler after a friend of mine.

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I mean, we definitely pulled from our lives.

253
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,000
We really were intrigued with the idea

254
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:47,999
of doing a true ensemble.

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's not like there's a lead and they have friends.

256
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:52,000
No, it's just about the friends.

257
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We're following all of their stories equally,

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,999
which we felt like we hadn't seen before.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The one-sentence pitch is it's about that time in your life

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
when your friends are your family.

261
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,999
- Want to see this area?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I knew you were gonna do it.

263
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,500
When did you knock?

264
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:20,000
Only in the reunion.

265
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:20,999
Wow-ee.

266
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,999
Oh, the beam is back.

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,999
Memories just flashed back

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,720
of, like, jokes coming out of the bathroom.

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,499
- I know, the bathroom.
- "Oh, do not..."

270
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,000
Just, like, stupid things that you would do.

271
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,999
Oh.

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,499
Did you go next door?

273
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
- I have not.
- Come on.

274
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,999
What's back here?

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Look at the chairs. The chairs are here.

276
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,999
Ohh, yeah, oh, yeah.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
These I think can be operated by just one person.

278
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:58,000
But back then, we had three per camera.

279
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,999
It was a huge crew.

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Four cameras, like, the choreography was incredible.

281
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:06,000
- Ohhh.
- Ohhh.

282
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:08,000
Ohh. Ohh.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,499
Do you remember the episode where

284
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,000
we never got out of the chairs?

285
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:14,999
Yeah.

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,999
Pizza's on the way.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,999
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,999
But you remember the beginning of the week

289
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
after the table draft, you came to me and you go,

290
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:22,999
"It's so stupid."

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,999
I was like, "Yeah, but that's the brilliance."

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And you were like, "Maybe we can have fun with this."

293
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:28,500
And then we had a blast.

294
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,000
What if we have to pee?

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,999
I'll cancel the sodas.

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,999
Oh, they're sitting in their chairs.

297
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,999
No, they aren't. Are they really?

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, Matty, it's good to see you, man.

299
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:45,999
This is great.

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Schwimmer, the episode where you guys were throwing a ball

301
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:52,000
and the whole time, you couldn't drop the ball.

302
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,999
I don't remember that.

303
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
- Let me ask the boys.
- What kind of ball?

304
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:56,999
It was like a Nerf ball.

305
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,999
Hey, guys. Hey, do you remember the one

306
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,999
where you guys were throwing a ball back and forth

307
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
- and you couldn't drop the ball?
- Couldn't drop the ball, yeah.

308
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:05,999
- Yes.
- So it was you two.

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,499
Everybody ended up getting in on it.

310
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,249
- Schwimmer was in on it.
- No memory.

311
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,000
You want to get something to eat?

312
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:12,999
Or you want to see how long

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
we can throw this ball back and forth?

314
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,999
- The ball thing.
- Yeah?

315
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
This is how old we are. This is what laptops were.

316
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,000
No, I remember that.

317
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,999
It's so heavy.

318
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,999
Let's go look at the dressing rooms.

319
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
- This is Jennifer's forever.
- My room.

320
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:31,999
Those are my hardwood floors.

321
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,999
You guys ate lunch together every day.

322
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
- Yeah, we did.
- First couple of years,

323
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:38,000
like, we ate every meal together.

324
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:38,999
That's right.

325
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
- Even on the weekend.
- We watched every show together.

326
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,999
We were inseparable, all of us.

327
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,999
Big center table here, and Enger would cook...

328
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It all seems small to me, the whole stage.

329
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:50,000
No, that's impossible, though,

330
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,999
because we haven't grown.

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
- Well, speak for yourself.
- Shut up.

332
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,999
Let's talk about favorite episodes.

333
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Everybody's got their favorite episodes.

334
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:05,999
I'm keen to know what are yours.

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I love the Thanksgiving ones, but I also... I loved

336
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,000
when we traded... when we lost the apartment.

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,999
The quiz, the embryos.

338
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,999
Yeah, the one with the embryos.

339
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah, but that quiz was really fun and really devastating.

340
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,999
Yeah.

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,999
I just can't believe that you think

342
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better

343
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,500
than we know you.

344
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:27,999
Well, we do.

345
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,999
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?

346
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
- Animals dressed as humans.
- That's correct.

347
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:36,000
What name appears on the address label?

348
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,999
- It's Chandler Bing!
- No!

349
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,999
Actually, it's "Miss Chanandler Bond."

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,499
If we win, they have to get rid of the rooster.

351
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,000
- Ooh, that's interesting.
- But if we win...

352
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:49,999
we get your apartment.

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,999
What is Chandler Bing's job?

354
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, oh, he's a transponds... transponster!

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's not even a word!

356
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:02,500
- No!
- Oh, my God.

357
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,999
- Yes!
- Whoo!

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,999
Okay, the test is ready.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Each team will answer a set of trivia questions, okay?

360
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The categories are "Fears and Pet Peeves,"

361
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,560
- "Ancient History"...
- Oh, no!

362
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,120
- ..."Literature"...
- Uh-oh.

363
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,499
- ...and "It's All Relative."
- Okay.

364
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,000
Now the coin toss to see who goes first.

365
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:32,999
Okay.

366
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,360
Okay, somebody call it this time.

367
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
- Oh, sorry.
- Okay, here we go.

368
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:37,001
Okay.

369
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,999
Heads.

370
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, it's tails, and the boys go first.

371
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,001
Alright. Okay.

372
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay, here we go. Pick your category.

373
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,999
- Ancient History.
- Alright.

374
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
"Rachel wrote Ross a letter and demanded he read it

375
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,500
before they got back together.

376
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,000
How many pages was that letter?"

377
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,000
18 pages.

378
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:56,999
Damn.

379
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
- 18 pages...
- Front and back!

380
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,500
Front and back is correct.

381
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:04,999
Oh, my God, that's good.

382
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
- This is the letter.
- Is that the letter?

383
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:07,999
This is the letter.

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Who gets the points for that?

385
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:09,999
- What?
- Me.

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,999
Okay, ladies, pick a category.

387
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
- It's All Relative.
- It's All Relative.

388
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:15,999
- Alright.
- Yes.

389
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
"Ladies, can you name this voice?"

390
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:20,999
That's my monkey.

391
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,999
Oh! Mr... Mr. Henkel.

392
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,999
- Mr. Winkel... Hinkel?
- Hinkel.

393
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
- Wait. No, no, no. Really?
- No? What's his name?

394
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,000
Wait, wait. Do it one more time.

395
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,500
Can we hear it again?

396
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:31,999
We know it. We know it.

397
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,999
No, wait, "That's my monkey."

398
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,999
It's the guy who lives downstairs.

399
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
- And his name would be...?
- Mr. Rickles.

400
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,000
- No.
- I know it. I know it.

401
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,500
I know it!

402
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:41,999
It's not your turn!

403
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No, will, the mystery voice please reveal himself?

404
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's Larry Hankin back as Mr. Heckles.

405
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:02,999
Heckles!

406
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,999
I said Larry Hankin.

407
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You all owe me a cat and a waffle.

408
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,999
Larry Hankin, everyone.

409
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But why didn't I get points for getting the name right?!

410
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:16,500
Alright, okay, guys, you're up.

411
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:17,999
- Literature.
- Literature.

412
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, that's a good choice, gentlemen.

413
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,999
- Thank you.
- Literature.

414
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
"According to Monica, how many erogenous zones

415
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:26,000
- are there on the female body?"
- Seven.

416
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:28,000
Courteney, Courteney, is that correct?

417
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:31,000
That's correct. Seven.

418
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,999
Alright, ladies.

419
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
- Ancient History.
- Ancient History.

420
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:40,999
Oh, you know what?

421
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,999
I'm... I'm gonna need a little help

422
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
- with this question.
- Oh, dear.

423
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:48,000
Gentlemen.

424
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:51,000
- Oh.
- Oh!

425
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
"This very barbershop quartet famously delivered

426
00:20:57,001 --> 00:21:00,000

but can you complete the lyrics?"

428
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:03,999

Thanks, guys.

447
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,999
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

448
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,999
I think "Friends" has this magic

449
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,999
because each character is so distinct

450
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that they could hold a television show by themselves.

451
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,999
Yes?

452
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,999
Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.

453
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
When my agent called me and said,

454
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,001
"Do you want to play

455
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,999
Rachel Green's sister on 'Friends, '"

456
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I was like, "Have I won the lottery?"

457
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:20,999
Which sister is this?

458
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,999
Is this the spoiled one or the one that bit her?

459
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,999
- Daddy cut me off.
- Never mind. I got it.

460
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,999
Okay, so one of the most exciting things was I got

461
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
to be in this scene where I'm in the apartment

462
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:35,000
and Joey walks in and he goes...

463
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,000
Hey, how you doin'?

464
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:37,001
Don't.

465
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,999
And it was his iconic line and I was so excited.

466
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And to watch a famous character say his famous line, come on.

467
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,999
Hey, it's Phoebe.

468
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,999
We can talk to Phoebe.

469
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
If you think about Monica or Phoebe or Rachel,

470
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,999
each one of them is a leading character.

471
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But together, you get this great repartee, all the actors

472
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:08,000
at the top of their game, and great chemistry.

473
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:08,999
Alright.

474
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell.

475
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:14,000
They'll never understand.

476
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,999
We have to say something.

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
We have to get it out. It's eating me alive.

478
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,500
They were funny, they were engaging,

479
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,750
they knew their characters so well,

480
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,999
but they also worked so well together.

481
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There was a real sense of love for each other.

482
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:33,500
- Monica...
- Bigger, louder.

483
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:35,000
...got stung by a jellyfish.

484
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,000
Alright.

485
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:39,000
I got stung.

486
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,999
Stung bad.

487
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I couldn't stand. I couldn't... I couldn't walk.

488
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We were two miles from the house.

489
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,999
We were scared and alone.

490
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
We didn't think we could make it.

491
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:53,999
I was in too much pain.

492
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And I was tired from digging the huge hole.

493
00:23:57,001 --> 00:24:00,999
And then Joey remembered something.

494
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,999
I'd seen this thing on the Discovery Channel.

495
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Wait a minute. I saw that on the Discovery Channel.

496
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah. About jellyfish and how if y...

497
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:14,999
- Eww.
- Eww!

498
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You... You peed on yourself?

499
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:19,000
Eww!

500
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,999
You can't say that. You don't know.

501
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain.

502
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,500
Anyway, I-I tried,

503
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:29,999
but I couldn't.

504
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,999
I just couldn't bend that way, so...

505
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
- Oh, Monica looks at Joey.
- Eww!

506
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:38,000
That's right, I stepped up.

507
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
She's my friend and she needed help.

508
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you.

509
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:48,000
Only, uh, I couldn't.

510
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I got the stage fright.

511
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,999
I wanted to help,

512
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
but there was just too much pressure, so... so I, uh...

513
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:01,000
I turned to Chandler.

514
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,499
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it, do it, do it now."

515
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,999
Sometimes late at night, I can still hear the screaming.

516
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That... That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through the wall

517
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:16,000
to freak you out.

518
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:16,999
And scene.

519
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,999
You know, I was laughing in that scene.

520
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,999
Do you remember the first table read ever?

521
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That's the first time I laid eyes on any of you.

522
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't remember how... I remember what you wore.

523
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,000
- That's it.
- That's unbelievable.

524
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:29,999
I don't remember what the boys wore.

525
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I do remember what Courteney and you wore.

526
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:33,999
- That's it.
- What did I wear?

527
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
- A white lacy hippie-ish blouse.
- Oh, I was trying to be Phoebe.

528
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,000
You were being Phoebe. And jeans.

529
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:42,500
And Courteney had a pink babydoll tee

530
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,999
from Fred Segal with a white trim.

531
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,499
Yeah, I just remember that's when we all met

532
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
or I remember meeting everyone the first time.

533
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,000
You don't remember what I was wearing?

534
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,999
I don't remember what,

535
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,999
but I do remember you're the first person I saw.

536
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And I was like, "Oh, okay. That's why I've been losing out

537
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:00,999
on all of these roles over these years.

538
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,999
I mean, this is the good... this is the hunk.

539
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,499
You know, right here. Of course he's Joey."

540
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,249
And then hearing all of you for the first time,

541
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,624
- I... that blew me away.
- That's what I remember.

542
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:15,000
I just thought everyone was so perfectly cast.

543
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:17,000
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's what I remember.

544
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:18,999
Casting the show was really hard,

545
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
much more so than I think we expected it to be.

546
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:25,500
We saw approximately a gazillion people.

547
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,999
There are so many different scenarios

548
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,499
where it wasn't going to be these six people.

549
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,000
It would have been such a different show.

550
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,499
We had seen David for another role

551
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,749
for a pilot we'd done the year before.

552
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,999
His hangdog expression stuck with us.

553
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So when we started doing Ross, that was in our minds.

554
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,999
Try to get David. David has quit television.

555
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
He's had a miserable experience doing another show.

556
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
He's moved back to Chicago to just do theater.

557
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:01,000
And we had to beg him and beseech him.

558
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,999
And "We wrote this for you."

559
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,999
I believe we sent him gift baskets.

560
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,999
I have no recollection of the gift basket.

561
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,999
I thought we just sent him the script.

562
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
We assured him that whatever his past experience was,

563
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:14,000
this was going to be different, we promise.

564
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:17,000
And he... he came on board.

565
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,001
Alright, we got one.

566
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We saw a bunch of women who read Phoebe,

567
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,999
and it was nothing.

568
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,499
And meanwhile, my husband, Jeffrey, was writing

569
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,999
and producing on "Mad About You," and he said,

570
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
"Phoebe is right here playing Ursula the waitress."

571
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:38,999
Here you go.

572
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks. We're fine.

573
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:43,500
Okay, I'm just gonna go get your check, then.

574
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:45,999
- Got it right here.
- Great. Okay. Right.

575
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You could see a lot of the beginnings of Phoebe there,

576
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,000
but on "Mad About You," she had more of an edge.

577
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:54,000
Phoebe was a much more positive image.

578
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Lisa was someone who came in and nailed the audition.

579
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:04,000
She not only did everything we'd hoped,

580
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:05,999
she elevated the material.

581
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,999
Lisa Kudrow was the second one

582
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,999
to get cast in "Friends" right after David.

583
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And that was at the beginning, so we thought we were on a roll.

584
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:14,000
And then came about two and a half months

585
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:16,000
where we cast no one.

586
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,999
Matt LeBlanc, if I remember correctly,

587
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
had like $11 in his pocket when he auditioned.

588
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:28,999
Maybe it was $9, but it wasn't a lot.

589
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We saw a lot of guys who you believed were actors,

590
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:36,999
guys who liked women, but they weren't funny.

591
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Then Matt came in and suddenly on him, the lines felt funny.

592
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:43,999
He hadn't done an awful lot.

593
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
He'd done another show, but he hadn't done an awful lot.

594
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:49,000
So Matt went right down to the wire,

595
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
auditioned at the network, at NBC with another actor,

596
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:56,000
and he killed it, and he got the part as Joey.

597
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,999
But the funny thing about it is

598
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the other actor ended up in the show

599
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:02,500
in "The One With the Unagi,"

600
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:05,000
playing Fake Joey, ironically.

601
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,500
How are you doing?

602
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:10,000
No, no, no, no, no.

603
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:12,999
How you doin'?

604
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
How you doin'? Damn it, Carl.

605
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:18,500
Go wait in the hall.

606
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What do you remember about the audition process?

607
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,499
I remember I had gone in a bunch of times,

608
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,999
and I think it was on the final callback.

609
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I had gone... I had gone with a friend of mine to run lines

610
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:38,999
and he said, you know,

611
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
"So the show's about friends and being friends

612
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:43,000
with, you know, just a group of friends?"

613
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:43,999
I was like, "Yeah, kind of."

614
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,499
He goes, "Then we should go out drinking."

615
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,000
And I was like, "Yeah, that's a good idea."

616
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:51,999
So to make a long story short,

617
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,999
I woke up in the middle of the night at his apartment

618
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and had to go to the bathroom, and I got up too fast.

619
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:59,000
And I can't believe I'm telling this,

620
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:02,000
but I kind of blacked out, as you do,

621
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:04,999
and fell face first into the toilet.

622
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,499
And I hit my nose on the bottom of the toilet seat

623
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,209
and a huge, like, chunk of meat came off my nose.

624
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,920
And I'm looking in the mirror and it's bleeding.

625
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,999
I was like, "Oh, my God."

626
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,999
So I have to go in for the big callback.

627
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,999
And it's like a big, ugly scab on my nose.

628
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And Marta Kauffman said, "What happened to your face?"

629
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And I told the truth and got the job so...

630
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
- Look at that.
- Right? That's what happened.

631
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,999
And, David, I know that at the time,

632
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,999
I think you were... you were doing a lot of theater.

633
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,999
What was it about "Friends" that attracted you to it?

634
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,999
Marta and David made it clear to me, made it known to me

635
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
that they had written the role of Ross with my voice in mind.

636
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,000
And I was like, "Well, I don't understand."

637
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:57,500
- Ah, it's a bug. It's a bug.
- Oh, no!

638
00:30:57,501 --> 00:31:00,000
- Is it gone?
- No, it's right there.

639
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Aah! Oh, that's fuzz. That's fuzz.

640
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:07,500
That's alright.

641
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,999
Was it real?

642
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
- Is it gone?
- It's gone, it's gone.

643
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:17,999
Can I just say...

644
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The important thing is that we dealt with it well.

645
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,999
Yeah.

646
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You even reacted to that like Phoebe.

647
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,999
That was great.

648
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That was much more entertaining than my story.

649
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:32,000
It really was.

650
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,999
We were having a tough time finding Monica,

651
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and we really saw Courteney as kind of a Rachel at the time.

652
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:44,000
We met with Courteney Cox, and she explained to us

653
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,999
why she didn't think she was a Rachel

654
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and that she herself was more of a Monica.

655
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:51,999
And she was right.

656
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Courteney brought this incredible joy to the character.

657
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:59,500
She'd been in the Bruce Springsteen video

658
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,000
and with Michael J. Fox on "Family Ties."

659
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:03,999
So people knew Courteney.

660
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Not enough so that it made it the Courteney Cox show,

661
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,000
which was always the fear.

662
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:10,999
We didn't want stars.

663
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But everything Courteney brought to it

664
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:16,000
made Monica so much richer

665
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
than what we had originally intended.

666
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I thought Chandler was gonna be the easiest part to cast,

667
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:27,999
because he's not just a character.

668
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,999
He's got jokes. He's got, like, actual real jokes.

669
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,999
So I thought, "Here we go. This is gonna be great."

670
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,499
And we saw actor after actor, and it wasn't funny.

671
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,749
We had worked with Matthew Perry on "Dream On."

672
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,000
And when Matthew reads that dialogue, it sparkles

673
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:48,999
and it comes alive.

674
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And for the first time through the casting process,

675
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,999
we knew there was a character there

676
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and that this was the only guy to play it.

677
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,999
There was just a little problem.

678
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,999
He had already signed on for another sitcom.

679
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It was about luggage handlers in the future at LAX.

680
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:09,500
It just sounded insane.

681
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,999
Enjoy Los Angeles.

682
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
By the way, Griffith Park has the best picnic areas.

683
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:20,999
Thank you. You are most insignificant.

684
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And then someone from Warner Bros. actually was

685
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,999
at the taping of "2194"

686
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,499
and thought "This show is never going.

687
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,999
Put him in 'Friends.' We'll be okay."

688
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Suddenly it was like "There's our Chandler."

689
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:38,999
And I just won $1 million.

690
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
He spins the lines in a way that they're his.

691
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:46,000
And there's so many comedy skills there.

692
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,999
Rachel was the hardest part to cast,

693
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,999
and it was the last part we cast.

694
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,999
She could be a really unlikable character.

695
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,499
I mean, this is an incredibly selfish, self-involved,

696
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,000
spoiled... in the wrong hands, you don't like Rachel.

697
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,000
We saw lots and lots and lots of other women.

698
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:11,000
Women who come in wearing actual wedding dresses

699
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,999
and none of it...

700
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,499
You didn't really fall in love, and you needed to,

701
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,000
'cause you needed to feel what Ross was feeling.

702
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:19,999
And then Jennifer came in.

703
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Jennifer had a similar problem to Matthew in that

704
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,999
she'd already signed on

705
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,999
to a show called "Muddling Through."

706
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,999
You gonna eat that steak or argue with it?

707
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Madeline, this here steak was supposed to be rare.

708
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,999
Gidney, tell me something.

709
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
How often do we have steak on the menu?

710
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:38,000
Shoot, hardly ever.

711
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,001
That's right.

712
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,999
So what you have there is a rare steak.

713
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,999
And they had already shot six episodes of this show,

714
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
so it was a little bit more than just the pilot.

715
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:55,000
And we took this big risk to cast her,

716
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,000
share her with this other show

717
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,999
and we'll see who wins.

718
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,999
And we even shot not only the pilot,

719
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
but probably three episodes of "Friends"

720
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,499
while that show was still on television.

721
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,000
And if it had... if CBS had picked it up,

722
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,999
we would have had to reshoot

723
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,499
the first three episodes of "Friends."

724
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,999
Jennifer had this warmth and sincerity

725
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and genuineness about her, where she just made you feel

726
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:25,500
okay about everything else that Rachel was

727
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,999
that you might have passed judgment on.

728
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.

729
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,499
Thank you.

730
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,000
Cut. Alright.

731
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So, that's right.

732
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,840
So, Matthew and Jen, you were in another show.

733
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I mean, Jen, what were your first impressions

734
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:47,999
of the rest of the cast

735
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,999
when you finally got to meet them,

736
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,999
when it was made clear that you could do the show?

737
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Well, first of all, I had a graveyard of failed pilots.

738
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:57,000
I did a pilot a year and I thought,

739
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,999
"That's what you do.

740
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You do a pilot a year and you have some cash.

741
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:02,999
And then you go on to another pilot."

742
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And I just remember sitting with these five other people

743
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:07,999
and thinking,

744
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
"This is the greatest group of people,

745
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,000
the greatest script.

746
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:14,999
I have to do this."

747
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,999
And I actually, tail between my legs,

748
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
hat in hand, went to the producer of the show I was on

749
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:22,999
because they hired me in second position,

750
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and I said, "Please release me from this show.

751
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I love this show that I'm doing right now.

752
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:30,999
Nothing against your show.

753
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I just love these people and I am having so much fun."

754
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:39,000
And he said... he goes, "I-I saw that show.

755
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,999
I'm gonna tell you something.

756
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That show's not gonna make you a star."

757
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,999
"This show is gonna make you a star."

758
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,499
- Enough said.
- Well, he's here tonight.

759
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,000
- That producer's here tonight.
- No!

760
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,999
Okay, guys, you're up.

761
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Okay, It's All Relative.

762
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,999
"While in Las Vegas,

763
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,999
Joey finds his identical hand twin."

764
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,999
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands

765
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
showcased in some type of a, uh, entertainment venue?

766
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:23,000
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand

767
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:26,500
and give it to you.

768
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:29,999
From this lineup...

769
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
please identify Joey's hand twin.

770
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,999
2 or 3.

771
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
- I think it's 2.
- You think it's 2?

772
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:45,999
I think it's 2.

773
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Right there, number 2.

774
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,999
Yes, that is correct.

775
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,999
It's Thomas Lennon, everybody.

776
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Great seeing you guys. Great seeing you.

777
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,000
Great to see you.

778
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,999
Alright.

779
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,999
Alright, ladies, ladies, you're up.

780
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
- Fears. Fears and Pet Peeves.
- Fears and Pet Peeves.

781
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,999
- Fears and Pet Peeves.
- Louder, Court.

782
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
"Ladies, there's a message on the answering machine.

783
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:17,000
Can you identify the voice?"

784
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:19,999
Matt, can you hit that button?

785
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
"Hey, guys, I'm finally retiring from ophthalmology

786
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,999
and would love for all of you

787
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,999
to come to my retirement party next week."

788
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
- Tom... Oh, sorry.
- Let me know if you can make it.

789
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,999
- Tom Selleck.
- Tom Selleck.

790
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,999
Oh, my God. I didn't say that. Wait.

791
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,999
- You looked so disappointed.
- Well, it's okay.

792
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Will the mystery voice please make himself known?

793
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:41,500
How could it not be?

794
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Look who it is.

795
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Tom Selleck, everybody.

796
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,000
Hello.

797
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,999
Do you want to sit for a sec?

798
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
- How you doing?
- Good to see you, buddy.

799
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:04,999
- Wow.
- Wow.

800
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Alright, Tom, you have a bonus question.

801
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:08,999
- Alright.
- Oh, God. Okay.

802
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Monica famously chose Chandler over Richard.

803
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What did Chandler do for a living?

804
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:19,000
Oh, my God.

805
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Just think this through. Think it through.

806
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:24,999
I say transponster.

807
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,999
No, that's what we lost the apartment over.

808
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,999
Oh, I thought we never found out, though.

809
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
- Transponster sounds good to me.
- Yes.

810
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,999
Transponster's not right.

811
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That's what I said. That's not even a word.

812
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:34,999
And then we lost.

813
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Right. Here's the answer. And it's...

814
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,000
- Oh, Tom has it.
- Yeah.

815
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,999
Nobody knows, really.

816
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
- That's the answer.
- That's what I just said.

817
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:44,500
Hey, that's the answer.

818
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:45,999
Yeah, that is the answer.

819
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I think that should go to the girls, then.

820
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:49,500
- I do too.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

821
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:51,250
They didn't have... No, no, no.

822
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,125
Yeah, yeah, we said nobody knows.

823
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:55,000
And the girls are the winners.

824
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,999
Obviously, the show came out

825
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,999
and immediately resonated with people.

826
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,999
When did you start to feel like those changes

827
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
that you'd been told about were starting...

828
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:16,000
the world was starting to change?

829
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:16,999
- The summer.
- It was... Yeah.

830
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,999
When we came back for a second season,

831
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,999
it was a completely different ballgame.

832
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I think people were starting to say, "Hey,"

833
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,999
and you were not... you were scared.

834
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,199
And "What do you want?" And at first, it's very jarring.

835
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,400
No one really prepares you for what that's going to be like.

836
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,999
I remember one time I was... It was middle of the week,

837
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I guess it was, I don't remember what day of the week.

838
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:40,999
Doesn't matter.

839
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,999
It goes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

840
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,999
Yeah, that part I know. But it was... I was...

841
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I happened to have the news on, and on the TV,

842
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:50,999
they had the screen split into six boxes.

843
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And it was an aerial shot, live, of each of our houses.

844
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:55,999
Oh, geez.

845
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,999
And I remember looking at it going "What the..."

846
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and I could hear the helicopter over my house.

847
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:01,999
I was like, "What the hell?"

848
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And I'm looking close at the screen, and my roof is a mess.

849
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:09,999
So when the helicopter flew away,

850
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,499
I got the ladder out and went up on the roof

851
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,999
and sure as shit, I've got some leaks up there.

852
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I had to call the roofer and have them come over and fix it.

853
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:21,999
The fact is, like, no one was going through

854
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
what we were going through except the other five.

855
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:26,999
So I think that was really...

856
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So there's no shoulders outside of this group

857
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:30,000
to sort of go, "Oh, this is so..."

858
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:32,000
And I think it kind of created...

859
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,999
imprinted in our neural pathways

860
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,499
this sort of, like, we are actually family.

861
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,999
Yeah. Because our family couldn't relate.

862
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,999
Our friends, our closest friends couldn't relate.

863
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,999
- They were there for us, I think.
- Your family could...

864
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,999
My family was more starstruck about it than we were.

865
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But the only other people who really knew what it was like

866
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:50,999
were the other five.

867
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,999
It seemed like you weren't getting...

868
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,499
We were doing a show, and we were working really hard.

869
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,000
But it wasn't until I was walking through the airport...

870
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:01,000
I don't remember where I was going...

871
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,999
but they were on every magazine.

872
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And I was like, "Whoa. Holy shit. This is crazy."

873
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The theme song became a hit on a radio station.

874
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,999
And when I heard that on my car one day,

875
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
that was like, "Wow, this is not your average television show."

876
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,500
They're on the cover of Rolling Stone.

877
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,250
Rolling Stone. I mean, we're a TV show.

878
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:31,000
They've somehow entered the zeitgeist.

879
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:32,500
I don't know when that happened.

880
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:33,999
♪ I'll be there for you ♪

881
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,999
Jennifer is gorgeous. Why is it such a phenomenon?

882
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,999
It just suits her very well. It's spectacular.

883
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,999
I think my favorite was I was dropping my kids off,

884
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and my rabbi stopped me and asked me about Ross and Rachel

885
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and when they were gonna get together

886
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:51,000
and how that's gonna happen.

887
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:51,999
Wherever we were,

888
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
suddenly there are thousands of people gathered.

889
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:56,000
It's like the Beatles were there.

890
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:57,001
Everybody was screaming

891
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
and yelling and behind barricades.

892
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:00,999
- It was crazy.
- Bye!

893
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,999
Once "Friends" had gone global,

894
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I think we were in 18 different languages.

895
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,999
Basically any place I went,

896
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
you know, from Jordan to India, they knew what "Friends" was.

897
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:24,000
My mom bought me the DVDs of the whole series

898
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,999
when I was in elementary school.

899
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,200
"Friends" really had a big hand in teaching me English,

900
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and the show really taught me the things

901
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:33,000
about life and true friendship.

902
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:35,000
We love "Friends."

903
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:36,999
Ohh.

904
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

905
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:42,500

Yeah, noisy boys.

912
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,999
We became fans of "Friends"

913
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
when we were in first year in college.

914
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:02,999
We were too shy to talk to girls,

915
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
so "Friends" was a way to boost our morale

916
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:07,999
and boost our confidence

917
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and be able to make new friends, especially ladies.

918
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:11,999
Yeah, baby.

919
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
My most favorite episode on "Friends" is the episode

920
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
in which Monica asks Chandler to marry her.

921
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:19,999
After seeing that,

922
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,999
I knew that is the way I wanted to ask my soul mate

923
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
and my husband to marry me, and that's exactly what I did.

924
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:29,999
I'm a single mom, and, you know, society pushes us

925
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,999
to marry the first guy who does say, "Will you marry me?"

926
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But I mean, as a woman, you have to take control of your life.

927
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:38,999
So watching that episode got me thinking

928
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
that I can also take charge of my own relationship.

929
00:44:44,001 --> 00:44:46,000
We're engaged!

930
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,999
I was battling depression.

931
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,999
I was at a very dark place.

932
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,999
One week, I wouldn't go out.

933
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,400
The need to even eat was a problem.

934
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I wouldn't eat.

935
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I was a gay man who wanted to have hair like Jennifer Aniston.

936
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:30,000
So you can imagine how lonely I sometimes felt.

937
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:33,000
And "Friends" was what I came home to.

938
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:35,999
"Friends" was...

939
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
They were my friends since I didn't really have any.

940
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:44,999
And, um... I can't.

941
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It became a reason for me to wake up every day

942
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:51,000
because I felt I had friends around me.

943
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,499
Like every Chandler,

944
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,000
I found my Monica.

945
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,499
I'm gonna cry.

946
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,249
That's so nice.

947
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,999
They have no idea

948
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
the kind of impact they partially made in this world,

949
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:14,000
so when they sleep, they should relax

950
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:16,000
knowing that they have saved more lives,

951
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,999
even if they don't know them. I am one.

952
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And for those who don't like the show, just, uh...

953
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,999
I think you're like Joey 100%,

954
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,999
because you just walk into my room

955
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,999
with these jokes that don't make sense.

956
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,499
- They are funny.
- But you are howling.

957
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,000
Like, you have tears coming out of your eyes.

958
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:34,999
They're always funny.

959
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So, yeah, I think you're Joey

960
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,000
with a hint of Phoebe.

961
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,999
Vee loves "Friends."

962
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And I realize what, like, this true addiction

963
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:48,999
to a TV show means.

964
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
- We watched it together as well.
- And then I got you hooked.

965
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:53,000
Yes, and that was my proudest moment.

966
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:55,000
When I got her hooked on it, I was like,

967
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:56,999
"Mission accomplished."

968
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And then we'd stay up all night watching it together.

969
00:46:59,001 --> 00:47:01,000
You know, "Friends" brought friends together.

970
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:02,999
Okay, everyone, gather up.

971
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
One of my favorite moments from "Friends" is the routine,

972
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:08,500
and that's the show where Ross and Monica

973
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:10,750
want to perform their favorite dance.

974
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:13,000
I know what'll get us up on a platform.

975
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:16,000
- What?
- The routine.

976
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,999
The routine.

977
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,999
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:02,999
It's on the end.

993
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,999
Now, throughout tonight,

994
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
we're gonna take questions from the audience.

995
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:09,999
There's a lot of fans here.

996
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Has anybody got a question tonight

997
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:14,999
for the cast of "Friends"?

998
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yes, there's a lady right here.

999
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:17,999
Yes. What's your question?

1000
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
So, "Friends" was obviously amazing for all of you,

1001
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:24,000
but was there anything that you didn't like?

1002
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:27,000
Way to keep it positive.

1003
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:30,000
Was there anything that you didn't like

1004
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:31,500
while you were shooting the show?

1005
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:32,999
- The monkey.
- And the monkey.

1006
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,999
- Oh, the monkey.
- Not Marcel. Really?

1007
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
- The monkey scared me.
- I loved the monkey.

1008
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:39,999
David was not a fan.

1009
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,499
Yeah, 'cause you didn't have to touch it.

1010
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,000
- What? I did too.
- Yeah, she did. She did.

1011
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:47,999
Eh. See...

1012
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
First of all, I want to say I love animals.

1013
00:48:50,001 --> 00:48:51,999
I love primates.

1014
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I have nothing against animals.

1015
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm an animal lover.

1016
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:58,999
However, I'm...

1017
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,499
Here was my problem.

1018
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,999
Like, the monkey,

1019
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,999
obviously, it was trained and it had to hit its mark

1020
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and do its thing right at the, you know, at the perfect time.

1021
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:12,500
But what inevitably began to happen

1022
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:15,000
was we would all have choreographed,

1023
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
like, bits kind of timed out, and it would get messed up

1024
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:21,999
because the monkey didn't do its job right.

1025
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
So we'd have to... we'd have to... we'd have to reset.

1026
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,999
We'd have to go again because the monkey

1027
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
- didn't get it right.
- David's so angry still.

1028
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,999
So this kept happening over and over

1029
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
where we're about to do something really funny.

1030
00:49:35,001 --> 00:49:36,000
But the monkey didn't hit its mark,

1031
00:49:36,001 --> 00:49:37,999
so we have to start again.

1032
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I would like you to be more serious about this.

1033
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,999
That combined... See, you didn't have to deal with it.

1034
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And that combined with when the monkey was resting

1035
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,999
and just waiting for, you know, for us to roll,

1036
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,999
it would sit on my shoulder and the trainer would come up

1037
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,999
and just open and give... give the monkey live grubs to eat.

1038
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So the monkey... the monkey would be sitting on my shoulder,

1039
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,999
take some grubs... take some grubs,

1040
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
like, break them in half, these squirming, live...

1041
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:10,999
then eat it, and then he'd just go like that.

1042
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,999
So I'd have monkey grubby hands all over, all over.

1043
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And it just wasn't... it was... it was time for Marcel to...

1044
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,999
...to off, you know?

1045
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,999
I got to say, great question.

1046
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
You really threw up some good answers there.

1047
00:50:31,001 --> 00:50:32,999
Alright. Okay. Let's go...

1048
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,999
I think we've got another question.

1049
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yes. There's a couple here in the audience here.

1050
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,000
Do you have a question?

1051
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:41,999
Yes, I do.

1052
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,499
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Mr. and Mrs. Geller.

1053
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,000
Christina Pickles and Elliott Gould, everybody.

1054
00:50:52,001 --> 00:50:53,999
Yay!

1055
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,999
Eliot, Christina, I'm keen to know,

1056
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,499
what do you remember about that time?

1057
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,000
I remember they were awfully nice to us.

1058
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:03,000
Very down-to-earth, real people.

1059
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:05,000
We loved it because they loved us.

1060
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,499
And one day we came to work and they said,

1061
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,000
"The parents are here, the parents are here."

1062
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,999
And it was so moving.

1063
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,999
And we really did feel like their parents.

1064
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
In fact, we used to worry about them quite a lot.

1065
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:19,999
And Elliott said to me,

1066
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,999
"We're behaving like we're really their parents,"

1067
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
and we really did feel we were because they're so sweet.

1068
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:28,500
- We love you.
- That's incredibly sweet.

1069
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:31,000
Thank you so much for being here tonight.

1070
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:33,000
Fantastic.

1071
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'd have to say, I'm most like Monica

1072
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:42,000
because I'm a clean freak.

1073
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,499
You know, I travel a lot

1074
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,249
and I'm always in hotels.

1075
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,000
I've always got downtime.

1076
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
When I'm missing the kids, when I'm missing the family,

1077
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:57,000
I put on "Friends" because it makes me smile.

1078
00:51:57,001 --> 00:52:01,000
Orange juice and what looks like cider.

1079
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:02,999
My favorite episode has to be

1080
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
where they're all getting ready in the apartment.

1081
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:08,000
It's fat. I drank fat.

1082
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,999
Ross is hurrying everyone up

1083
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,999
because he has a huge speech to make, and he's nervous.

1084
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
- Why aren't you guys dressed?
- We have a half-hour.

1085
00:52:16,001 --> 00:52:18,000
When Chandler goes to the toilet,

1086
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,999
Joey sits in Chandler's chair,

1087
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,499
and then he comes back and it all escalates.

1088
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,999
- You're in my seat.
- How is this your seat?

1089
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
- Because I was sitting there.
- But then you left.

1090
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:31,000
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

1091
00:52:31,001 --> 00:52:33,000
Joey eventually gives up his seat,

1092
00:52:33,001 --> 00:52:35,000
but he takes the cushions with him.

1093
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:35,999
What are you doing?

1094
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,999
Well, you said I had to give you the chair.

1095
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,999
You didn't say anything about the cushions.

1096
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,499
The cushions are the essence of the chair.

1097
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,999
That's right. I'm taking the essence.

1098
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's one of those episodes that when I'm away

1099
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:49,000
and when I'm feeling a little bit low,

1100
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:50,001
I just put it on

1101
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,080
and it makes me smile to almost the point of crying.

1102
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.

1103
00:53:03,001 --> 00:53:06,000
- Oh, my God.
- Look at me, I'm Chandler.

1104
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:09,500
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

1105
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:13,000
Maybe if I wasn't going commando.

1106
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
"The One Where Nobody's Ready," it's the first episode

1107
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:19,500
we ever did that's shot in real time like a play.

1108
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:22,000
I'll tell you, it's hot with all this stuff on.

1109
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:25,999
I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.

1110
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,999
Some of that was you had to do some bottle shows.

1111
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You had to do shows that weren't gonna cost a fortune

1112
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:34,999
and keep them located just on our sets

1113
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,999
without building new sets, without, you know.

1114
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So how do you make a story where you put everybody in one room?

1115
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,000
What were you doing when your arm came out of the socket?

1116
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:44,999
- Oh.
- Shoulder.

1117
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That was when he and I were fighting over the chair.

1118
00:53:47,001 --> 00:53:49,500
That was one of the best episodes we ever did.

1119
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:52,000
- Oh, oh, I remember.
- Okay, you tell it.

1120
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:52,999
- Firemen.
- Yeah.

1121
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
There were firemen in the episode.

1122
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:57,999
- No.
- No? I'm sorry.

1123
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,499
There were firemen on the set.

1124
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,000
No, Warner Bros. fire department

1125
00:54:01,001 --> 00:54:01,999
came in to help Joey.

1126
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,040
I'm sorry. I take it back.

1127
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,999
But go ahead and announce that again.

1128
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,999
That's the best moment I've had in months.

1129
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Chandler and Joey have been fighting over this chair,

1130
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:18,000
and Joey runs and jumps into the chair.

1131
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,499
We shot it three times, and it went perfectly.

1132
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,249
Lord knows why we had to shoot it a fourth time.

1133
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:32,000
You want to go for me sitting on Matty's lap?

1134
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And I went just to jump over the coffee table

1135
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,500
- and somehow tripped.
- Oh, God.

1136
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:37,999
And my legs went up in the air

1137
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
and my shoulder came out of the socket.

1138
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Are we gonna watch this? His arm getting pulled out?

1139
00:54:46,001 --> 00:54:47,121
- Oh, here it is.
- Oh, shit.

1140
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,999
I don't want to see pain.

1141
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It doesn't look like anything till I stand up.

1142
00:54:52,001 --> 00:54:53,500
Okay, okay.

1143
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:54,999
Action.

1144
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,999
Oh, no!

1145
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,999
Ow, ow, ow. It happened right there?

1146
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
- Yeah.
- Did it already happen?

1147
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:05,000
- Yeah.
- Shit.

1148
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:05,999
Ohh.

1149
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Oh, are you pulling on it? Are you pulling the wrong arm?

1150
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:20,000
- No, it's the other one.
- It's the other one.

1151
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:23,000
No, no, no, no, it's going down too far.

1152
00:55:23,001 --> 00:55:24,001
Oh, shit.

1153
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Okay, Gretchen? Just a moment, please.

1154
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:36,000
- Should we cut?
- Ow!

1155
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:37,001
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

1156
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,999
- Are you for real?
- Yeah.

1157
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
- Yeah, 'cause he dislocated his shoulder.
- 'Cause it hurt.

1158
00:55:41,001 --> 00:55:42,000
Oh, I thought someone tried to pull on it.

1159
00:55:42,001 --> 00:55:44,000
Jesus.

1160
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,999
Cut.

1161
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,499
So in come all the paramedics and whatever,

1162
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,000
and they've got to take him to the hospital.

1163
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:55,000
And so that was the end of filming

1164
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:56,999
because it wasn't even an episode

1165
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,976
we're like, "Well, we can shoot out the other scenes."

1166
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
No, it happened to be on the one episode

1167
00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:01,999
where it's just the six of them,

1168
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
they're all in it, and we're done for the night.

1169
00:56:06,001 --> 00:56:07,500
And the way... do you remember how

1170
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:09,000
the sling was written into the show?

1171
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,999
- No.
- Oh.

1172
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Whoa!

1173
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
See, Joe, that's why your parents told you

1174
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,999
not to jump on the bed.

1175
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,999
So we had to put that into the show,

1176
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,999
but we waited until he was okay again

1177
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
to film the ending of "The One Where No One Was Ready."

1178
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:32,999
Did you tell the doctor you did it

1179
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,999
- jumping up and down on your bed?
- No.

1180
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,499
So what started out to be the simplest "Friends" episode

1181
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,000
ended up taking the longest amount of time to shoot.

1182
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:46,999
There was one thing that we did every show

1183
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
that we didn't do that night before we started.

1184
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:49,999
- Our huddle.
- Mm-hmm.

1185
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
- We didn't do it that night.
- We didn't do the huddle.

1186
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:52,999
We didn't do it?

1187
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,739
That's the one time we didn't do it.

1188
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,480
- Why didn't we do it?
- I don't know.

1189
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,499
That's right, 'cause we were sort of like,

1190
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,999
"You know what? We're taking too long.

1191
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
The audience has been waiting. Let's just go."

1192
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:03,999
I think that's why we didn't do it.

1193
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,999
- Really?
- Well, it was sort of early on.

1194
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
- It wasn't like...
- It was very early on.

1195
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:09,001
And then after that,

1196
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
we were like, "Do we need to do the huddle?"

1197
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:13,000
- And he'd say, "Yeah."
- Yeah, we do.

1198
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
"'Cause I don't want anything else falling off me."

1199
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:17,000
- Yeah.
- We do need to do the huddle.

1200
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:18,999
After that, we always did it.

1201
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Let's go see where we did the huddle.

1202
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:21,999
Right here. Let's go.

1203
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,360
Straight down to this purple door.

1204
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,999
We did the huddle right here.

1205
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,999
- Yeah.
- Right around here.

1206
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Come on, let's do a huddle. Come on.

1207
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:30,000
Wait. You mean we...

1208
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So the atmosphere on tape night was always crackling.

1209
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:39,041
There was a lot of energy.

1210
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It was exciting. You're putting on a show.

1211
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:49,999
It was a fun night,

1212
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
but it was a really hard working night for us

1213
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:54,999
and we would listen to the audience.

1214
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And if a joke didn't land, even if we loved that joke,

1215
00:57:58,001 --> 00:57:59,999
they were telling us it's not good enough.

1216
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So we would put our heads together and try to beat it.

1217
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:07,999
It's a buffet. It's in trouble.

1218
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,999
It's in trouble, like I'm gonna go eat it all.

1219
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
How about "Here's where I win all my money back"?

1220
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:15,999
I like that. Great.

1221
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,600
Kevin, there's a lot of changes coming.

1222
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,999
- Good shit.
- You guys ready?

1223
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.

1224
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,999
It's a buffet, man.

1225
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,999
Oh, here's where I win all my money back.

1226
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I really enjoyed the energy of the audience, though.

1227
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:36,000
- I mean, the live audience.
- Oh, yeah.

1228
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:37,001
- I mean...
- I did, too.

1229
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's like doing a one-act play every week with all of us.

1230
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:40,999
I found myself, like,

1231
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,999
when they would laugh at something,

1232
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I would think to myself, "Oh, if you think that's funny,

1233
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:47,000
when till you get a load of this next line."

1234
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:49,000
They would challenge me to try even...

1235
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:51,999
I felt this rewarding feeling.

1236
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
- Or not. Or a flat nothing.
- I'm coming over here.

1237
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:56,000
- I feel left out over there.
- Sit here.

1238
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:57,001
At least to me,

1239
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I felt like I was gonna die if they didn't laugh.

1240
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:03,000
And it's not healthy for sure.

1241
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:04,999
But I would sometimes say a line,

1242
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,499
and they wouldn't laugh, and I would sweat

1243
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,999
and... and just, like, go into convulsions.

1244
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,499
If I didn't get the laugh I was supposed to get,

1245
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,000
- I would freak out.
- It would take you down.

1246
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:17,000
- You didn't tell us that.
- No?

1247
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,999
No, I don't remember you ever saying that.

1248
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Oh, yeah, I felt like that every single night.

1249
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
One of the times we listened to the audience the most

1250
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:31,999
was when we were shooting in London

1251
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
and Monica and Chandler are in bed together.

1252
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:36,999
Action.

1253
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I'm getting married today!

1254
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:39,999
Morning, Ross.

1255
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,499
I'm getting married!

1256
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,999
- A-whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

1257
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Do you think he knew I was here?

1258
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,999
The audience went insane.

1259
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
We were just standing there going "This is insane."

1260
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:04,000
We just let them go.

1261
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,499
Okay, your turn.

1262
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,999
No, I'm kidding.

1263
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
- Cut!
- He told me to say it.

1264
01:00:19,001 --> 01:00:20,999
He did.

1265
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,999
I think that moment was the beginning

1266
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
of how we rethought Monica and Chandler,

1267
01:00:25,001 --> 01:00:26,999
'cause the original plan was

1268
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
they would sleep together in London,

1269
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,999
it was a brief thing,

1270
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,999
and we'd have some fun with it afterward

1271
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
as they're both like, "Oh, my God, what did we do?"

1272
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:37,000
But the way the audience reacted,

1273
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:39,500
we realized there's more to this

1274
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:41,999
and we need to pay attention.

1275
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Well, I've never done that with you before.

1276
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,999
That was the end of the season,

1277
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
so we had time to really ruminate and think about it,

1278
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:57,999
but it was such a powerful moment

1279
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,999
that we knew we had to explore it more.

1280
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
We expanded it from just a "one night in London" thing

1281
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:07,000
to "this could be a thing" thing.

1282
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I'm still on London time. Does that count?

1283
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
- Oh, that counts.
- Oh, good.

1284
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:19,999
We still, at that point,

1285
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,999
didn't quite realize how far it would go.

1286
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
We still thought maybe it'd be fun with them doing it in secret

1287
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:28,000
and hiding it, which did give us a lot of funny stuff.

1288
01:01:28,001 --> 01:01:32,000
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

1289
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,999
I've had a very long, hard day.

1290
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I love the episode where they've just returned home

1291
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,999
from London and Monica and Chandler

1292
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
are trying to keep it a secret that they've been hooking up.

1293
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,499
So thanks for having me over.

1294
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,999
The cast, they know how powerful

1295
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,999
just, like, a funny visual set piece will be,

1296
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
and it's funnier than anything they could have ever said.

1297
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:09,000
Rach.

1298
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Phoebs.

1299
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,999
See ya.

1300
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,999
So the really great thing about "Friends"

1301
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,999
- is they're so good with farce.
- What the hell was that?

1302
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
So when there's a secret like Monica and Chandler are dating,

1303
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:33,500
it's so fun because we the audience knows,

1304
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:35,999
but none of the rest of the cast knows.

1305
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Okay, this is from "The One Where Everyone Finds Out."

1306
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:39,999
Ugly naked guy's apartment.

1307
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,499
Phoebe and Rachel have tagged along with Ross.

1308
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,000
Although it's pretty empty, it's a great place.

1309
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:46,999
Oh, my God.

1310
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,999
I love this apartment. Isn't it perfect?

1311
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I can't believe I never realized how... how great it is.

1312
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:55,500
Well, that is because your eye immediately

1313
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:57,999
- goes to the big naked man.
- It's amazing.

1314
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You better hurry up and fill out an application,

1315
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:01,000
or I'm gonna beat you to it.

1316
01:03:01,001 --> 01:03:02,999
Ohh.

1317
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
- That's sort of how you did it.
- Is that?

1318
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:09,999
Well, I never thought I'd say this,

1319
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
but, um, I'm gonna go use ugly naked guy's bathroom.

1320
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:15,500
She exits. Phoebe looks out the window.

1321
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:18,000
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.

1322
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:20,999
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

1323
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Chandler and Monica are standing close together.

1324
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:25,000
They start taking off each other's clothes.

1325
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Phoebe's mind is totally blown.

1326
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:30,000
Oh! Oh!

1327
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:32,999
Oh! Oh!

1328
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Chandler and Monica! Chandler and Monica!

1329
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:38,000
Rachel sees what Phoebe is seeing.

1330
01:03:38,001 --> 01:03:39,999
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1331
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1332
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:43,999
- Oh! My eyes! My eyes!
- I know.

1333
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebs, Phoebe.

1334
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:48,500
- Oh!
- It's okay. It's okay.

1335
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:50,250
- It's okay.
- They're doing it!

1336
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:52,000
I know. I know. I actually know.

1337
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:54,000
- I know I know.
- You know?

1338
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:55,999
I do. I know. And Joey knows.

1339
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But Ross doesn't know. So you have to stop screaming.

1340
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
What's going on?

1341
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:04,999
- What, what?
- Nothing.

1342
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,499
Oh, God, we're just so excited

1343
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,000
that you might get this apartment.

1344
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Actually, it looks really good.

1345
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Get in here. Come on. Get in here. Hug it out.

1346
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:17,000
Hug it out. Hug it out.

1347
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Oh, my God. Alright.

1348
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,999
Yeah, don't get too excited.

1349
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,400
I haven't done this in a long time.

1350
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So I should be Phoebe for this.

1351
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:43,999

1361
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It's so weird, 'cause I was walking down the street

1362

- and I just happen to have my...
- Guitar.

- Oh, my God.
- You mind if I...

1367

- Oh, please.
- ...take "Smelly Cat"

for a spin?

1369
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000

No, but thank you. Thank you.

This was so great.

1401
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I still think it's better when it's just me.

1402
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:33,500
It is.

1403
01:07:33,501 --> 01:07:35,999
Oh, you heard it.

1404
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,999
Can I just say something?

1405
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Thank you so much for being the person

1406
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:40,999
for all of us on "Friends"

1407
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
that was the... I don't know if this is the right way to say it,

1408
01:07:44,001 --> 01:07:48,000
but the different one or the one that was really herself.

1409
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:51,000
Thank you. And thanks for carrying it along.

1410
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:54,000
- I'm gonna start crying.
- Yeah.

1411
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,400
There are seasons I've never seen.

1412
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,999
- Me too.
- Really?

1413
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
- Yeah.
- I've seen them all.

1414
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:05,999
I've seen every episode.

1415
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,440
I would imagine I've seen them all.

1416
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Michel and I started watching some of Season 4,

1417
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:12,000
which I thought I had watched.

1418
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:12,999
It's as if I didn't.

1419
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Do you enjoy them when you watch them?

1420
01:08:16,001 --> 01:08:18,000
He enjoys them more than I do

1421
01:08:18,001 --> 01:08:20,000
'cause I'm mortified with myself.

1422
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:20,999
- Why?
- I don't know.

1423
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,999
- You're so good.
- I don't know.

1424
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,999
Like Lisa, I hadn't seen it really in 17 years

1425
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
until my daughter just started watching it this past year.

1426
01:08:33,001 --> 01:08:36,000
And that kind of sucked me into it.

1427
01:08:36,001 --> 01:08:39,000
For me when I watch it, it's... I'm...

1428
01:08:39,001 --> 01:08:41,000
it's hard to watch myself,

1429
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,999
but I feel that way about anything I do

1430
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
because I don't believe the acting that I'm doing,

1431
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:50,500
because I know it's not true,

1432
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,999
'cause it was me doing it.

1433
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,999
That's what you do for a living.

1434
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
No, I know, but it's weird to look at myself.

1435
01:08:57,001 --> 01:09:00,000
I'm like, "I don't buy a word of it."

1436
01:09:00,001 --> 01:09:01,999
It's really weird.

1437
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But to watch you guys, I was just so proud to be on the show.

1438
01:09:06,001 --> 01:09:09,000
It's just some of the stuff is so great.

1439
01:09:09,001 --> 01:09:11,999
Yeah. When I do watch the episodes,

1440
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,499
I'm laughing out loud once in every scene

1441
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,249
because you all make me laugh so hard.

1442
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,999
That thing with the leather pants.

1443
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh, my God. That's still... That was on the other day.

1444
01:09:21,001 --> 01:09:23,000
I just happened to be in the kitchen with Maureen

1445
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:24,999
and we were eating dinner and "Friends" is on.

1446
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
And I'm like, "Oh, look at that. Let's see which one it is."

1447
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:30,000
And it happened to be the one with the leather pants.

1448
01:09:30,001 --> 01:09:33,000
And I said to my daughter, "Watch this.

1449
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:35,999
This is funny. Watch David."

1450
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,999
And it was really, really, really funny.

1451
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,999
Every little thing, like pulling the pants up

1452
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and, like, slipping and smacking yourself in the head.

1453
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:48,000
And I know you. It was all so calculated.

1454
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:49,999
Nothing happens by accident with you.

1455
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I've watched you put things together and it was brilliant.

1456
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,499
I can't quite be specific about which one,

1457
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,749
but I know I'm part of the Geller family.

1458
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,000
I'm incredibly anal, I'm neurotic as hell,

1459
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:19,000
and I wear overly tight trousers.

1460
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,999
Whoa.

1461
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I think one of the reasons "Friends" is so funny

1462
01:10:27,001 --> 01:10:29,000
is the fact that these six actors

1463
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:31,000
are masters of physical comedy.

1464
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,999
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

1465
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,499
There's a scene with David Schwimmer

1466
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,000
where Ross has decided not to pay for

1467
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:39,999
the delivery service of a sofa,

1468
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,499
and they start taking the couch up the stairs

1469
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,999
and quite quickly, everyone gets into trouble.

1470
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
This is not something that's gonna go up the stairs.

1471
01:10:48,001 --> 01:10:49,999
Turn.

1472
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,999
I don't think we can turn anymore.

1473
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And David Schwimmer starts telling them to pivot.

1474
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:57,000
Here we go, pivot.

1475
01:10:57,001 --> 01:10:59,500
Pivot.

1476
01:10:59,501 --> 01:11:02,250
Pivot!

1477
01:11:02,251 --> 01:11:04,625
Pivot!

1478
01:11:04,626 --> 01:11:06,312
Pivot!

1479
01:11:06,313 --> 01:11:07,999
Pivot!

1480
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,999
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

1481
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,499
The thing about that scene is it's so simple.

1482
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,999
If you were to see it on the page initially,

1483
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
it's three actors carrying a couch up the stairwell.

1484
01:11:22,001 --> 01:11:24,999
There's maybe a page of dialogue,

1485
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and nothing really in that dialogue suggests

1486
01:11:28,001 --> 01:11:30,000
anything massively comic.

1487
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:31,999
But what they do in that time

1488
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,999
in carrying that couch up those stairs

1489
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
is one of the funniest things I've seen on TV.

1490
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Okay. Here we go.

1491
01:11:47,001 --> 01:11:47,999
Pivot!

1492
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,999
Pivot!

1493
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Alright, let's cut.

1494
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,999
Remember our marks?

1495
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Do you remember what color you were?

1496
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,999
- Yellow.
- Blue.

1497
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
- You're blue?
- I don't... I never looked down.

1498
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:23,999
I always used the corner...

1499
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,999
- You looked.
- I used the corner...

1500
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,999
You tripped every time. You wouldn't look.

1501
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Wait, what happened? I don't remember you tripping.

1502
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:30,999
The big... yeah.

1503
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,499
He ran in, he looked at his mark...

1504
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,000
- No, I tripped on that.
- He tripped.

1505
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,480
- He just fell...
- Every single time.

1506
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,999
- And I ran.
- You ran as fast as you could.

1507
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,499
But the second time I came in and looked like this.

1508
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,999
I went like this the second time. I came running.

1509
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.

1510
01:12:57,001 --> 01:12:59,000
Phoebs, check it out.

1511
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
The third time, I went to pull the chair over,

1512
01:13:05,001 --> 01:13:06,999
and the chair fell over.

1513
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.

1514
01:13:11,001 --> 01:13:12,001
Jesus.

1515
01:13:15,001 --> 01:13:15,999
Sorry.

1516
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
And the final time, you came in.

1517
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Because I was like, "Somebody is getting a laugh.

1518
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:21,999
I can't handle it.

1519
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I need to get... I need to get a laugh too."

1520
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:26,999
Phoebs, Phoebs.

1521
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.

1522
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:31,000
Oh, Soap Opera Digest.

1523
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Oh, no.

1524
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
That yeti is one smooth talker.

1525
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:47,000
Yetis are smooth talkers.

1526
01:13:47,001 --> 01:13:49,000
That's why, um...

1527
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,999
Oh, these are bloopers?

1528
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
That yeti is one smooth talker.

1529
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:55,999
Yetis are smooth talkers.

1530
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
That's why you never see any pictures.

1531
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
He cannot play at our wedding.

1532
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:06,999
Everyone will leave.

1533
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It'll be like when he rapped at my "butt" mitzvah.

1534
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Your "butt" mitzvah?

1535
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:17,999
Thank you.

1536
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:23,999
What?

1537
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,360
How can you keep straight a face?

1538
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
How much do you have that's good?

1539
01:14:41,001 --> 01:14:43,000
- None.
- None of it? Okay.

1540
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I can't belie... Oh, I just looked right at you.

1541
01:14:46,001 --> 01:14:49,000
I'm so sorry.

1542
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:50,999
Action.

1543
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,999
I can't believe Emma's still asleep.

1544
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I know. What are we going to do?

1545
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,999
Ha-ha, I win.

1546
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
The is that?

1547
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:11,999
Ready?

1548
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Ha-ha, I win!

1549
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,999
What is that?

1550
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
That's fire, you jagoff.

1551
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,999
The game's over.

1552
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Take off your robe.

1553
01:15:29,501 --> 01:15:31,750
Okay, I mean...

1554
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:33,999
- No!
- No!

1555
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Do not take it off.

1556
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:39,999
That was his idea.

1557
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Matty, that was your idea. You remember that?

1558
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,499
She carries that tray to the doctor

1559
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,000
because if she doesn't, people die.

1560
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Oh, no.

1561
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,999
Lisa, your laugh. Oh, my God.

1562
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,499
No, it's the greatest thing in the world.

1563
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,249
It's the most infectious laugh in the world.

1564
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,000
- It's so cute.
- The most infectious sound.

1565
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:09,000
The bloopers were so funny.

1566
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
When you look back, who had the loudest laugh?

1567
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:16,000
Who had the loud... Oh, really?

1568
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:17,999
- Lisa.
- Really, Lisa Kudrow?

1569
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,640
- You had the loudest.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1570
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,999
- The best laugh.
- I can't help it.

1571
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
- The most enjoyable laugh ever.
- Oh, when Lisa laughs...

1572
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:25,999
Oh, my God.

1573
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I can't believe you didn't say me.

1574
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Maggie Wheeler, everybody. It's Janice.

1575
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,999
Mwah. How are you?

1576
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,999
Maggie Wheeler.

1577
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,499
Maggie, if you perch on the corner here,

1578
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,000
Jen, you come back in, everyone shift up.

1579
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:56,500
Maggie, if you perch in here for us.

1580
01:16:56,501 --> 01:16:59,000
Thank you for being here, Maggie.

1581
01:16:59,001 --> 01:17:00,999
What an absolute thrill.

1582
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Let's talk about Janice for a moment.

1583
01:17:03,001 --> 01:17:06,999
Where... Where did...

1584
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,999
Where did Janice come from?

1585
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You know, I got the audition sides across my fax machine,

1586
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:16,500
and it said "fast-talking New Yorker,"

1587
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:19,000
and I thought, you know, I know her.

1588
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:19,999
I-I grew up there.

1589
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I-I just... She lives in me. That's it.

1590
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:26,000
You love me, Chandler Bing.

1591
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,999
Oh, no, I don't.

1592
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,999
You seek me out.

1593
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn.

1594
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:43,999
Janice, Janice.

1595
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,499
You want me, you need me,

1596
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,749
you can't live without me.

1597
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,999
Matthew Perry is so funny.

1598
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And the minute I set eyes on him and he opened his mouth,

1599
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,000
I thought, "Oh, God, I'm gonna lose it.

1600
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:55,999
I'm gonna crack up.

1601
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
This character needs a laugh because I'm not gonna be able

1602
01:17:58,001 --> 01:17:59,999
to get through a single scene with this guy."

1603
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And I just looked at him, and I went

1604
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:04,999
And that was it.

1605
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,999
It was just born in the moment.

1606
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Thank you, Matthew, for inspiring that.

1607
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:13,000
Anyway, everybody, oh, my God.

1608
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:14,999
The "Friends" reunion.

1609
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
- And I get to be a part of it.
- Maggie Wheeler, everybody.

1610
01:18:18,001 --> 01:18:18,999
Thank you so much.

1611
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Bless you. Maggie Wheeler, everybody.

1612
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
What about that? What a treat.

1613
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:29,999
Oh, I love her.

1614
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Now, I should say there was somebody very,

1615
01:18:33,001 --> 01:18:35,000
very special involved in the show

1616
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:36,999
who couldn't be here tonight

1617
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
but so desperately wanted to be part of the show,

1618
01:18:41,001 --> 01:18:43,999
he's joining us on Zoom right now.

1619
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome James Michael Tyler.

1620
01:18:48,001 --> 01:18:49,999
He's here. It's Gunther.

1621
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Gunther himself, everybody!

1622
01:18:52,001 --> 01:18:52,999
He's here.

1623
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Hey, what's up, everybody?

1624
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:56,999
How are you?

1625
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,999
Good to see you. You all look great.

1626
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Tell us about your experience making the show

1627
01:19:03,001 --> 01:19:05,000
and how your character just came to life

1628
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:06,999
over the course of these seasons.

1629
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
It was the most memorable 10 years of my life, honestly.

1630
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:18,000
I could not have imagined just a better experience.

1631
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:19,999
All these guys were fantastic.

1632
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It was just a joy to work with them.

1633
01:19:21,001 --> 01:19:23,000
I felt very, very special.

1634
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:24,500
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

1635
01:19:24,501 --> 01:19:26,000
When's your birthday?

1636
01:19:26,001 --> 01:19:27,999
May 5th. Why?

1637
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.

1638
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:33,000
- Oh, mine's December...
- Yeah, whatever.

1639
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Ladies and gentlemen, James Michael Tyler,

1640
01:19:36,001 --> 01:19:37,999
Gunther himself.

1641
01:19:40,001 --> 01:19:41,999
Thanks.

1642
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,999
I mean, will you allow me to ask

1643
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,999
what I would consider to be a cheeky question?

1644
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
It's impossible not to realize and see that you were all young,

1645
01:19:54,001 --> 01:19:58,999
hot, good-looking, successful actors.

1646
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And it's inconceivable to me that there weren't

1647
01:20:03,001 --> 01:20:07,000
perhaps off-screen romances.

1648
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Well, I mean, David?

1649
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:13,999
Yeah.

1650
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
- Yeah, I mean, the...
- The first season.

1651
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:19,500
Yeah, the first season, we...

1652
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:22,250
I had a major crush on Jen.

1653
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:25,000
- I...
- It was reciprocated.

1654
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:26,999
And I think we both at some point,

1655
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
we were both crushing hard on each other,

1656
01:20:29,001 --> 01:20:30,999
but it was like two ships passing

1657
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
because one of us was always in a relationship.

1658
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:38,000
So... And we never crossed that boundary.

1659
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:39,999
You know, we respected that.

1660
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
- And... but we both...
- Bullshit.

1661
01:20:46,001 --> 01:20:47,500
No, no.

1662
01:20:47,501 --> 01:20:48,999
No.

1663
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1664
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:53,999
It's true. It's true.

1665
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,999
Honestly, I remember saying one time to David,

1666
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
"It's going to be such a bummer if the first time you and I

1667
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
actually kiss is gonna be on national television."

1668
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:07,999
Sure enough, first time we kissed

1669
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,999
- was in that coffee shop.
- Hang on, so...

1670
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
But so we just channeled all of our adoration and love

1671
01:21:14,001 --> 01:21:16,000
for each other into Ross and Rachel.

1672
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,999
Is this blowing anyone else's mind?

1673
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Wait. Hang on.

1674
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,499
That scene in the coffee house when their first kiss,

1675
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:33,000
I mean, that was like... I watched it the other day,

1676
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:33,999
and I was weeping.

1677
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
The tension, it was just palpable.

1678
01:21:38,001 --> 01:21:39,999
The... It was just perfect.

1679
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I'm so glad you guys didn't because I don't know...

1680
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:43,999
well, you would've just been great actors.

1681
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
- But, man, that was something.
- Yeah, we were really

1682
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,000
just not great actors.

1683
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Interior, coffee house late that night.

1684
01:21:54,001 --> 01:21:56,000
Rachel's putting up chairs.

1685
01:21:56,001 --> 01:21:58,999
Ross enters agitated.

1686
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,499
- Hi.
- I didn't get a cat.

1687
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,999
Oh. That's interesting.

1688
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,499
No, no, it's not interesting, okay?

1689
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,999
It's very, very not interesting.

1690
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
It's actually 100% completely the opposite of interesting.

1691
01:22:12,001 --> 01:22:13,999
Alright. Alright. I get it, Ross.

1692
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.

1693
01:22:17,001 --> 01:22:19,000
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie

1694
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:20,999
before I found out about you.

1695
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,999
Hey, I was doing great before I found out about you.

1696
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,999
You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?

1697
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Well, then you should have said something before I met her.

1698
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:30,999
I didn't know then.

1699
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
And how come you never said anything to me?

1700
01:22:33,001 --> 01:22:34,999
There was never a good time.

1701
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,499
Right, because you only had a year

1702
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,000
and we only hung out every night.

1703
01:22:38,001 --> 01:22:41,000
Not... Not every night.

1704
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,999
You know, and it's not like I didn't...

1705
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way,

1706
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:47,999
you know, like... like Italian guys

1707
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:54,000
or, uh, ex-fiancés, or... or... or Italian guys.

1708
01:22:54,001 --> 01:22:57,000
Hey, there was one Italian guy, okay?

1709
01:22:57,001 --> 01:22:58,999
And do you even have a point?

1710
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Yeah, the point is, I-I don't need this right now, okay?

1711
01:23:03,001 --> 01:23:05,000
It's too late. I'm with somebody else.

1712
01:23:05,001 --> 01:23:07,000
Okay? I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

1713
01:23:07,001 --> 01:23:08,200
Okay, so what are you saying?

1714
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:09,999
You can just sort of put away feelings

1715
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,499
or whatever the hell it was that you felt for me?

1716
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,000
Hey, I've been doing it since the ninth grade.

1717
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:13,999
I've gotten pretty damn good at it.

1718
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,800
Alright, fine. You go ahead and you do that.

1719
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:16,999
Alright, Ross?

1720
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,480
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.

1721
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,499
- Good.
- Good.

1722
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,249
And you know what?

1723
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:24,124
Now I got closure.

1724
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,999
He storms out.

1725
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Furious, Rachel locks the three locks on the front door.

1726
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Then she stops, leans on a table and drops her head.

1727
01:23:48,001 --> 01:23:50,000
When she looks up, she's startled to see Ross

1728
01:23:50,001 --> 01:23:53,000
at the door staring back at her.

1729
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,999
They hold each other's gaze.

1730
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,999
She steps slowly towards the door, then more quickly,

1731
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
she unlocks the first lock, the second, the third,

1732
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,000
and then goes to pull the door open.

1733
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Try... Try the bottom one.

1734
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
The door flies open, Ross rushes in, grabs her,

1735
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:31,000
and they kiss.

1736
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:38,999
Yay!

1737
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,999
- Ohh.
- That was good.

1738
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I thought back on the very first year or two, you know,

1739
01:24:46,001 --> 01:24:47,999
when we had breaks from rehearsal,

1740
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
like, there were moments we would, like, cuddle

1741
01:24:51,001 --> 01:24:51,999
on a couch or something.

1742
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
We would spoon and fall asleep on the couch.

1743
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,999
And I'm thinking,

1744
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,999
"How did not everyone know

1745
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
we had... were crushing on each other?"

1746
01:25:05,001 --> 01:25:06,999
We knew. We knew.

1747
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,499
Yeah, we knew for sure.

1748
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,000
Great. Now. Thanks.

1749
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It was a situation that we couldn't...

1750
01:25:18,001 --> 01:25:19,321
we couldn't do anything about it.

1751
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,999
How great, though, ultimately,

1752
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,499
'cause if you had and it didn't work out,

1753
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,000
it would not have probably been as great.

1754
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,999
I'm gonna go down and ask each of you,

1755
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
and this is just a simple yes or no answer.

1756
01:25:37,001 --> 01:25:38,999
- Okay.
- Okay?

1757
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Were Ross and Rachel on a break?

1758
01:25:42,001 --> 01:25:44,000
- Absolutely. Yes.
- Yes.

1759
01:25:44,001 --> 01:25:46,999
- Yes.
- Yes.

1760
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Yeah, we were on a break.

1761
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:52,999
Yeah.

1762
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
We had amazing guest stars on our show.

1763
01:26:04,001 --> 01:26:05,500
Couldn't believe all these people

1764
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:07,000
that we were all massive fans of.

1765
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,999
- Yeah.
- We had Danny DeVito.

1766
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,999
Did someone call for the long arm of the law?

1767
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
- Oh, my God, was he funny.
- Oh, that was so funny.

1768
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:20,000
- I remember... Oh, my gosh.
- Ben Stiller.

1769
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:21,999
Ben. One of our biggest laughs ever.

1770
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Remember when Ben... when we went over there?

1771
01:26:24,001 --> 01:26:26,500
What are you quacking about?

1772
01:26:26,501 --> 01:26:29,000
Ooh, quack, quack, Donald Dodo.

1773
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
"You chickadee, you little chickadoo."

1774
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:40,999
It was so funny.

1775
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,999
I don't know why it was so funny.

1776
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
- 'Cause he's funny.
- 'Cause of Ben Stiller.

1777
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:48,999
- And Julia Roberts.
- Julia Roberts.

1778
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
- That's right.
- And who enjoyed Julia Roberts?

1779
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Come on.

1780
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
- Your fella Brad.
- Pitt came, did one.

1781
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:03,000
Rachel Green.

1782
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,999
God, I hate her, Ross. I hate her.

1783
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And, of course, we had one of my idols, Sean Penn.

1784
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:15,000
Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?

1785
01:27:15,001 --> 01:27:16,001
Okay, I will.

1786
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But right after, you have to tell me who the hell you are.

1787
01:27:18,001 --> 01:27:21,000
And then we get the script and, of course,

1788
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:24,000
I realize that "Oh, I'm a... I'm a potato."

1789
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:25,999
- Hey.
- Hey.

1790
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Oh, 'cause it was the Halloween episode.

1791
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:29,999
So I had no...

1792
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,999
like very little, if any, dialogue with him.

1793
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
But here I'm thinking "Greatest actor in the world,

1794
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:36,000
and I'm a potato.

1795
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,001
I'm a potato."

1796
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Oh, my God. You're Sputnik.

1797
01:27:39,001 --> 01:27:40,999
Yes.

1798
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,999
Marry her.

1799
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Now, there's been some incredibly memorable outfits

1800
01:27:48,001 --> 01:27:52,000
and costumes over the 10 seasons of "Friends,"

1801
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,999
and we thought we'd take a look

1802
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,999
at some of those iconic costumes right here tonight

1803
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
with our very own "Friends" reunion fashion show.

1804
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:05,999
Cue the music.

1805
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage

1806
01:28:12,001 --> 01:28:13,999
Cara Delevingne.

1807
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,499
Cara is modeling Rachel's bridesmaid dress

1808
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:25,000
from Barry and Mindy's wedding in Season 2.

1809
01:28:25,001 --> 01:28:26,999
- Look at that.
- Yes.

1810
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,999
As far as bridesmaid dresses go,

1811
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,999
it's actually quite understated.

1812
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Modeling Ross's leather pants from Season 5,

1813
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:37,000
it's Cindy Crawford.

1814
01:28:37,001 --> 01:28:38,999
Yeah!

1815
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,999
These are Ross's incredibly tight pants,

1816
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
but once he got them on, he couldn't get them off again,

1817
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:58,000
and I think we've all been there.

1818
01:28:58,001 --> 01:28:59,999
It's Sputnik time,

1819
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,999
and I know when you think of Sputnik,

1820
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
you think of the one, the only Justin Bieber.

1821
01:29:06,001 --> 01:29:06,999
- What?
- What?

1822
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It's part Russian satellite, part potato.

1823
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,999
Look at that. Justin Bieber, ladies and gentlemen.

1824
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
It's astonishing that he's even managed to make that look cool.

1825
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
And next up, perhaps the most famous look of them all,

1826
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:39,000
it's Santa's half-Jewish friend.

1827
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:43,500
It's the Holiday Armadillo.

1828
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Cara Delevingne, ladies and gentlemen,

1829
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:53,000
as the Holiday Armadillo.

1830
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,999
Oh, my God. That's amazing. Whoo!

1831
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
This surely is a high point in her modeling career.

1832
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
- Yeah, baby.
- Work it, work it!

1833
01:30:08,001 --> 01:30:10,999
That's amazing.

1834
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,999
And, ladies and gentlemen,

1835
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
wearing all of Chandler's clothes,

1836
01:30:15,001 --> 01:30:17,000
it's Matt LeBlanc!

1837
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,499
How did you do that?

1838
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,000
How did you do that?

1839
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
You are so cute.

1840
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:27,999
Oh, my God.

1841
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Could he be wearing any more clothes?

1842
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,499
Yeah, Matty!

1843
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,499
The "Friends" finale and their farewell party.

1844
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,000
Tonight, the cast is taping the last episode

1845
01:30:51,001 --> 01:30:52,999
of their historic sitcom.

1846
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,499
Here I am on the set of "Friends"

1847
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,999
in Monica and Chandler's apartment,

1848
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,000
where in just hours, the show that made TV must-see must end.

1849
01:31:01,001 --> 01:31:04,000
If the show was about that time in your life

1850
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:06,500
when your friends are your family,

1851
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:09,000
once you have family of your own,

1852
01:31:09,001 --> 01:31:10,999
it's no longer that time.

1853
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,999
So the show came, I think, to a natural end.

1854
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
It was really important for us to end everyone in a good place.

1855
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
We wanted to know that Monica and Chandler

1856
01:31:25,001 --> 01:31:27,000
were gonna have their babies.

1857
01:31:27,001 --> 01:31:27,999
Hey.

1858
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:28,999
- Hi.
- Hi.

1859
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And that Phoebe was gonna be happy and had a life.

1860
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:35,999
I want one.

1861
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,999
Oh, yeah?

1862
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Well, tell me which one. I'll try to slip it in my coat.

1863
01:31:40,001 --> 01:31:42,000
There was some discussion in the writers room

1864
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
about do we really want Ross and Rachel to get together?

1865
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:49,999
- Rachel?
- I'm so sorry.

1866
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
And we discussed perhaps sort of ambivalent endings

1867
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:56,000
where it seemed like down the...

1868
01:31:56,001 --> 01:31:58,500
and we went, "No, this is 'Friends.'

1869
01:31:58,501 --> 01:32:00,750
People have been waiting 10 years

1870
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:02,999
to see this couple get together.

1871
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,999
We've got to give them what they want.

1872
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
We just have to find a way to do it

1873
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:07,999
so the journey is unexpected."

1874
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Isn't there any way that you could just let me off the...

1875
01:32:12,001 --> 01:32:13,999
No! No!

1876
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Oh, my God. Did she get off the plane?

1877
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:17,081
Did she get off the plane?!

1878
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I got off the plane.

1879
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,999
Cut!

1880
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
The night itself was very difficult to get through.

1881
01:32:59,001 --> 01:33:02,999
I really wanted to savor every minute of it.

1882
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I knew it was going to end, and I didn't want it to end.

1883
01:33:06,001 --> 01:33:08,000
Adiós, arrivederci, au revoir.

1884
01:33:08,001 --> 01:33:11,000
Take one, five cameras.

1885
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Okay, should we get some coffee?

1886
01:33:18,001 --> 01:33:19,500
Sure.

1887
01:33:19,501 --> 01:33:21,250
Okay.

1888
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:25,125
Where?

1889
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And cut.

1890
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,999
The minute it was over...

1891
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,999
Marta and I looked at each other,

1892
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,999
and I just kind of went to pieces.

1893
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,999
Yeah, there was a lot of crying that night.

1894
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I don't know how we got through actual scenes.

1895
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I remember that moment, all of us up

1896
01:33:51,001 --> 01:33:53,999
at the end of the hall there.

1897
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,520
That was nice. It was, like, private.

1898
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,999
Yeah.

1899
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I feel emotional about it now that I think about it.

1900
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,999
It was not just the end of a series.

1901
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
It was the end of 10 years of relationships.

1902
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,999
I mean, we were really, really proud of the show,

1903
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
but like anything good, it's sad when it's over.

1904
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
That night, right after I called wrap...

1905
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:06,999
Cut.

1906
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,499
...the sets immediately started to be taken down

1907
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:12,000
because there was a pilot that was coming into

1908
01:35:12,001 --> 01:35:14,000
the stage the next day.

1909
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
That last day, seeing them strike the set,

1910
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
it's like seeing someone pack up your childhood home.

1911
01:35:22,001 --> 01:35:24,000
It's gone.

1912
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,999
We ended up with an impromptu party

1913
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,999
where everybody just stayed on set and sat there,

1914
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
and we ordered pizza and beer, people signed the flats,

1915
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:42,000
and it was an incredibly lovely, moving night.

1916
01:35:42,001 --> 01:35:44,000
Did we all sign this at the end?

1917
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
- Oh, we all signed this.
- Wendy.

1918
01:35:48,001 --> 01:35:50,000
- Oh.
- Carlos!

1919
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:51,999
Oh, there's mine.

1920
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,999
- What?
- What is it?

1921
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
"I shit here." That's right.

1922
01:35:58,501 --> 01:36:00,250
I knew it!

1923
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Of course that's you.

1924
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,499
"The best 10 years of my life.

1925
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,749
- Love to all."
- That's me.

1926
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,000
- Oh, yeah.
- That's nice.

1927
01:36:10,001 --> 01:36:10,999
That is nice.

1928
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
- Marika!
- Not as nice as mine.

1929
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:13,999
No.

1930
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,999
We're here now, all six of you.

1931
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Lisa, has it crossed your mind about, you know,

1932
01:36:21,001 --> 01:36:24,000
well, maybe we could do another episode,

1933
01:36:24,001 --> 01:36:25,999
maybe we could do a movie?

1934
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Is that something you'd ever even contemplate?

1935
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,999
No, no.

1936
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,999
I'm sorry. I haven't.

1937
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
No, because that's all up to Marta and David,

1938
01:36:36,001 --> 01:36:38,000
and I once heard them say,

1939
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,999
and I completely agree,

1940
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,999
that they ended the show very nicely.

1941
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Everyone's lives are very nice, and they would have to unravel

1942
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,499
all those good things in order for there to be stories.

1943
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,000
And, yeah, I don't want anyone's happy ending unraveled.

1944
01:36:56,001 --> 01:36:59,000
Yeah. Also at my age to be, say, like,

1945
01:36:59,001 --> 01:37:00,500
floopy, stop.

1946
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,999
- You have to grow up.
- Well, let me ask you this.

1947
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Where do you think your characters would be today?

1948
01:37:10,001 --> 01:37:10,999
Where's Rachel?

1949
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Rachel. Rachel... I think we're... did we get married?

1950
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:16,500
- Let's say we got married.
- Sure.

1951
01:37:16,501 --> 01:37:17,999
Okay.

1952
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I think we ended up getting married, and we had some kids.

1953
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:22,500
- Kids, yeah.
- And you still played

1954
01:37:22,501 --> 01:37:24,000
- with bones.
- Still playing with bones.

1955
01:37:24,001 --> 01:37:25,000
Playing with bones, and...

1956
01:37:25,001 --> 01:37:26,999
That's paleontology.

1957
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Paleontology, still a paleontologist.

1958
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It gets Joey every time. I don't know why.

1959
01:37:34,001 --> 01:37:34,999
Playing with bones.

1960
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Playing with the bones.

1961
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
So you guys are together. You're happy.

1962
01:37:41,001 --> 01:37:42,999
- You've got kids.
- Yes.

1963
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,999
Where are Monica and Chandler?

1964
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I think my character, Monica, is still really competitive.

1965
01:37:48,001 --> 01:37:51,000
Her kids are probably not even in... you know,

1966
01:37:51,001 --> 01:37:52,081
they're probably graduated.

1967
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
But she still is in charge of the bake sale

1968
01:37:55,001 --> 01:37:57,000
at, you know, an elementary school.

1969
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:59,000
She's just got to keep things going.

1970
01:37:59,001 --> 01:38:00,999
PTA, you know.

1971
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And you are making me laugh every day.

1972
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I just wanted to make sure I factored in there somewhere.

1973
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
And what's Phoebe doing?

1974
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Phoebe's married to Mike. They're probably in Connecticut.

1975
01:38:15,001 --> 01:38:15,999
They had kids.

1976
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,040
And I think she was like the advocate for her kids,

1977
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
who were a little different and all the other kids

1978
01:38:21,001 --> 01:38:22,999
who were just a little different, you know?

1979
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Creating the arts program and the music thing and all that.

1980
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:26,999
Yeah.

1981
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,999
And where's Joey?

1982
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I think he probably opened a sandwich shop in Venice Beach.

1983
01:38:32,001 --> 01:38:32,999
Oh!

1984
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,999
Oh, I wish he would.

1985
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I wish he would - Why not?

1986
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I wish he would.

1987
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Here's Courteney Cox.

1988
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
My sister on the show.

1989
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,999
Honest, this will really make me cry,

1990
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,999
but this will be the last time that we're ever asked

1991
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,999
about the show as a group, that we will do this.

1992
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Like, we're not going to do this again in 15 more years.

1993
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:04,999
I'll tell you one thing.

1994
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
We are not waiting so long to have a dinner.

1995
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
No, we're not. We will not wait that long to get together.

1996
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,999
I have really enjoyed today. I really have.

1997
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I didn't know, like, kind of what to expect coming into this.

1998
01:39:20,001 --> 01:39:22,000
I knew it was going to be awesome

1999
01:39:22,001 --> 01:39:25,999
to see these five people.

2000
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,000
What I did not take into account was being back on the set...

2001
01:39:31,001 --> 01:39:32,000
- No.
- ...and in this environment.

2002
01:39:32,001 --> 01:39:34,500
And it's... it's...

2003
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:37,000
it's pretty cool.

2004
01:39:39,001 --> 01:39:40,999
Yeah.

2005
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Just please also state that I don't cry like this

2006
01:39:43,001 --> 01:39:44,000
when we get together and have dinners.

2007
01:39:44,001 --> 01:39:46,000
Yeah, no. Jen never cries.

2008
01:39:46,001 --> 01:39:48,999
No, I...

2009
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I mean, it was an incredible time.

2010
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:03,000
Everything came together.

2011
01:40:03,001 --> 01:40:04,999
We became best friends who...

2012
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,999
just the chemistry, the whole thing.

2013
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,999
It was life-changing, and it forever will be.

2014
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,999
Not just for us, but for people who watch it.

2015
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And that's just such a great feeling to carry forever.

2016
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I'm really thankful, and I love you guys so much.

2017
01:40:19,001 --> 01:40:21,999
I love you so much.

2018
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
- It's Courteney?
- It's Courteney.

2019
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,999
The best way that I can describe it is

2020
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
after the show was over, at a party or any kind of

2021
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
social gathering, if one of us bumped into each other,

2022
01:40:58,001 --> 01:41:00,000
that was it, that was the end of the night.

2023
01:41:00,001 --> 01:41:02,000
- You just...
- Sat with that person.

2024
01:41:02,001 --> 01:41:04,000
...sat with the person all night long.

2025
01:41:04,001 --> 01:41:05,000
That's true. I remember.

2026
01:41:05,001 --> 01:41:06,999
And that was it.

2027
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,999
You apologized to the people you were with,

2028
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
but they had to understand you had met somebody special to you

2029
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:14,641
and you were going to talk to that person

2030
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,999
for the rest of the night.

2031
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,976
- And that's the way...
- I'm not laughing, I'm crying

2032
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
- because it's so true.
- That's the way it worked.

2033
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
It's certainly the way it works with all of us.

2034
01:41:33,001 --> 01:41:35,000
It's just the way it is.

2035
01:41:35,001 --> 01:41:37,999
Mm-hmm.

2036
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,499
I'm going to cry now.

2037
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,999
Good.

2038
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I've got a piece of a Kleenex.

2039
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,499
Thanks. I'll take it.

2040
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:46,999
It's been COVID tested.

2041
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,560
Thank you. I'll take it. COVID tested?

2042
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
COVID tested.

2043
