2
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,881
Report status.

3
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,283
Captain, holding Russian <i>Akula</i>
at 400 yards.

4
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,251
- Best bearing 0-3-5.
- We remain undetected, sir.

5
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,443
Two hours, 45 minutes
in her baffles, Captain.

6
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,363
We're right up lvan's ass,
and they don't even know it.

7
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,407
Mind your panel.

8
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,885
Conn, Captain. Maintain range.
Stay right behind her.

9
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,286
Captain, explosion aboard the Konek.

10
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,521
- Put it on the bearing.
- Yes, sir.

11
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,922
They're going out
on their emergency distress pinger.

12
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,767
Transmit two pings of active.

13
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,966
- Let them know we're here.
- Hold up.

14
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,122
What is that?

15
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,041
Torpedo in the water
bearing 3-3-5 at 600 yards!

16
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,691
Torpedo evasion. Make your depth 700 feet!

17
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,200
- Was that from the Konek?
- No, sir.

18
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,361
It's a contact directly above us.

19
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,124
- 400 yards!
- All ahead flank!

20
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,690
- Captain, there's no time.
- Two hundred yards!

21
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,285
- Right hard rudder!
- Terminal homing!

22
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,841
- Admiral.
- Captain.

23
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,161
Tampa Bay's gone missing
just above the Kola Peninsula.

24
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,810
NAVSEA reports no recent repairs,

25
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,961
no problems with the radio

26
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,804
and no weather over the Barents Sea.

27
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,804
Awfully close to Russian waters.

28
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,245
Yes, sir.
They've been playing cat and mouse

29
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,486
with a Russian sub for weeks.

30
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,324
Let's just hope that's all it is.

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,689
Sir, they're two hours late for check-in.

32
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,721
The hell we can't.

33
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,529
We need to get back to Congress

34
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,170
and twist some goddamn arms.

35
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,049
An arms race in the Arctic, Charles?

36
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,485
Oh, come on, it's a land grab.

37
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,528
The Russian president is simply posturing,

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,647
pounding his chest.

39
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,370
He's embarrassed us in Syria.

40
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,329
He continues to defy us in Crimea.

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,243
Are we going to let him
dominate us in the Baltic?

42
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,526
And what next, Europe?

43
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,523
We can't afford another Cold War,

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,642
neither can they.

45
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,210
Isn't it true to say we are witnessing

46
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,931
the most aggressive
military buildup in Russian history?

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,329
It's not a time to pussy around.

48
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,165
Sir, Tampa Bays gone missing
in the Barents Sea.

49
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,721
We picked up a distress signal
above the Kola Peninsula.

50
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,648
Hmm. That's Russia's back porch.

51
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,008
There's classified systems on that boat.

52
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,250
And 110 men, sir.

53
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,366
Of course. Well, you wanna go quick,

54
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,284
but you wanna go armed,
fast-attack submarine.

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,169
I told the 6th Fleet
you'd want a hunter-killer.

56
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,045
We don't have one in EUCOM region,

57
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,645
not with a rescue-sub attachment.

58
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,241
We do. We have one.

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,602
No, son. Arkansas just lost her skipper.

60
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,480
And I assigned her a new one.

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,129
He's in the region, never been a captain.

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,124
Joe Glass?

63
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,926
Where the hell did you find him?

64
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,361
What class was he?

65
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,565
Never went to Annapolis, sir.

66
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,807
Glass.

67
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,611
<i>Stand by for secure transmission
from Fleet Forces Command.</i>

68
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,321
Commander Glass?

69
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,761
XO Brian Edwards.

70
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,844
How was your trip in
from Portsmouth, Captain?

71
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,367
Fast. What have you got there?

72
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,724
Sealed orders from 6th Fleet.

73
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,885
They're not wasting any time, sir.

74
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,563
XO, recall the crew.

75
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,366
We sail as soon as possible.

76
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,123
Well, they've just been given
a two-day pass, sir.

77
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,321
They'll be impossible to find.

78
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,487
Impossible?

79
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,402
Tell me something, XO.

80
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,529
How many pubs are there in Faslane?

81
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,202
Two.

82
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,248
Then let's devise a radical plan.

83
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,367
You look in one
and I'll look in the other.

84
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,408
Aye, sir.

85
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,601
Down, down.

86
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,443
Opening hatch.
Tubes one and four operational.

87
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,048
- Load torpedo tube one.
- Loading!

88
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,487
Mother of Jesus,
we're packing a lot of heat.

89
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,766
Yeah, why do you think
we need 'em all?

90
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,605
- Captain's orders is all you need to know.
- I heard he was on the Baton Rouge.

91
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,603
A wrench monkey.
Ain't never been a captain.

92
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,523
I heard a rumor he punched
his commanding officer.

93
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,968
Yeah, yeah. I heard he's all right.

94
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,769
Always hitting the hottest
piece of ass in port,

95
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,841
from here to Samoa.

96
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,445
- Yeah? So, so he's one of us.
- What?

97
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,488
When the hell have you ever hit
a hot piece of ass, Brickowski?

98
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,806
When have you ever met

99
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,405
- a captain who's one of us?
- Jackass.

100
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,170
All right, settle down.
We've got some work to do.

101
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,602
Carry on.

102
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,401
Captain in control.

103
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,602
Ship is rigged for dive,
Captain. No surface contacts.

104
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,841
I intend to launch the ship.

105
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,250
Arkansas is cleared
for passage, sir.

106
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,441
Navigator Park.
Where are we headed, Captain?

107
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,285
Warship Arkansas, this is
your captain, Joe Glass.

108
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,883
<i>Now, I want to say that I knew
Commander O'Brian personally,</i>

109
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,405
<i>and I know he trained you well.</i>

110
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,760
<i>Now, I'm hearing a lot of chatter</i>

111
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,171
<i>about the kind of captain that I might be,</i>

112
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,366
<i>so let me tell you directly.</i>

113
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,366
Not an Annapolis man,

114
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,925
who learned who you are in a class.

115
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,251
I've worked your jobs. Manned a sonar.

116
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,244
Been the bull nuke.
I've cleaned torpedo tubes.

117
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,524
If you think I know you better than your
previous officers, you're right.

118
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,251
<i>I've been underwater all my life.</i>

119
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,524
<i>I've missed five elections,
seven Super Bowls,</i>

120
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,728
my sister's wedding,
and my father's death.

121
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,045
This is all I know down here.

122
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,402
I am you.

123
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,841
If you think that means
I'm running anything other

124
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,922
than the tightest ship you've
ever seen, you're dead wrong.

125
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,364
It's not an idle training exercise.

126
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,291
Your brothers on Tampa Bay
are missing in Russian waters.

127
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,167
Possibly sunk.

128
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,807
Every one of you knows
someone on board that sub.

129
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,128
Now, we're gonna find them.

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,001
So, follow orders.

131
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,924
I expect nothing short of your best.

132
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,806
I can do some of your jobs
better than you. I won't.

133
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,961
They're your jobs...

134
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,491
But they're my responsibility.

135
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,961
Carry on, XO.

136
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,962
Aye, sir.

137
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,161
Admiral Fisk?

138
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,642
Admiral Fisk.

139
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,245
I'm briefing the president
in under an hour,

140
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,651
and your Navy boys are not sharing.

141
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,166
I work for the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs,

142
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,685
not the NSA, Miss Norquist.

143
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,569
Or are we on a first-name basis now?

144
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,609
- Thing at my kid's school.
- Fair enough.

145
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,565
IUSS picked up two explosions
off the Kola Peninsula,

146
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,165
right where Tampa Bay went missing.

147
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,649
- Two?
- Could be one of theirs,

148
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,721
could be one of ours.

149
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,449
Is there any chance that they collided?

150
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,482
Not likely.

151
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,770
Have you reached out
to your Russian counterparts?

152
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,727
What do they say?

153
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,441
That's classified.

154
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,646
Now who's not sharing?

155
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,370
What time were the explosions recorded?

156
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,888
0904 and 0906 GMT.

157
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,841
What's wrong?

158
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,406
Ever since the Russians started
building up their fleet at Polyarny,

159
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,289
we've been keeping tabs
on the Russian president.

160
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,568
Zakarin left the Kremlin
with his core security,

161
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,290
and he's headed right there
to the Kola Peninsula.

162
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,646
- Sure, because of this incident.
- No.

163
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,924
He left before the two explosions.

164
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,121
A scheduled meeting
with his Defense Minister, Durov.

165
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,721
I don't like coincidences.

166
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,881
Well, I put a sub in the water.

167
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,206
We'll have answers soon.

168
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,442
Admiral.

169
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,921
You're about two stars short of clearance
for what I'm about to tell you.

170
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,689
I've been trying to get
the NSA to authorize an op,

171
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,966
and they've been dragging their feet,

172
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,129
and now everything is moving way too fast.

173
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,842
If this was an act of aggression, we need
to know what Zakarin is doing there.

174
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,922
If you want to fly a drone
into Russian airspace,

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,001
- the Air Force will be happy to...
- No, no.

176
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,561
Not from 60,000 feet.

177
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,045
We need eyes and ears on the ground.

178
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,205
I'm sure you know someone
who could go off-book

179
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,361
for the next 48 hours.

180
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,448
You want me to send a team into Russia?

181
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,922
Yes, I do.

182
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,361
Follow me!

183
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,526
Move! Move! Move!

184
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,402
Room clear!

185
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,090
- You got 30 seconds, Martinelli!
- Moving!

186
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,527
Move! Go! Move! Move! Move!

187
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,921
Twenty seconds!

188
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,362
Ten seconds!

189
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,287
Five!

190
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,242
Time!

191
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,922
Hey!

192
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,726
Congratulations, Martinelli,
you just killed the whole fucking team!

193
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,282
Shit.

194
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,724
Bag 'em, rack 'em,
and stack 'em, Martinelli.

195
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,562
Damn it!

196
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,563
Beaman ain't one
to hold back on his emotions.

197
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,087
Irritation, anger, and rage.

198
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,447
Hey, Commander,
isn't it past your bedtime?

199
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,485
What's he so pissed off about
all the time?

200
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,006
Well, maybe it's 'cause he's
from Birmingham. Ever been there?

201
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,367
Hey, you know, I'm closing
on a house off East Lake Park.

202
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,889
I don't suppose that's paperwork
you got in your hand.

203
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,360
Looks like we're going ugly.

204
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,641
How can you tell?

205
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,286
Just look at Beaman.

206
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,606
Son of a bitch is amused.

207
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,601
It's a recon, boys.

208
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,563
Stow all your simunitions
and training gear.

209
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,768
- We're going live.
- Where we headed, boss?

210
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,042
Come in.

211
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,565
Crew's on board and ready to go, sir.

212
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,882
Very well, Cob.

213
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,365
I have something for you, Captain.

214
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,566
I know supply's all out,

215
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,127
but I thought you should have
one of your own before we get underway.

216
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,130
I appreciate the gesture, Cob, but...

217
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,881
But I can't take your coin.

218
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,761
I don't think I'm gonna be buying anybody
a drink on this trip.

219
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,127
Are you sure, sir?

220
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,802
Yeah.

221
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,126
I only got space
in this pocket for one coin.

222
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,241
<i>You were on the Wichita.</i>

223
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,526
My first boat.

224
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,931
Was it as bad as they say, sir?

225
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,561
I don't know what they say,

226
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,606
but it was probably worse.

227
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,528
That coin, my good luck charm.

228
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,601
Only one I ever carry.

229
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,160
Let's get underway.

230
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,922
Aye, Captain.

231
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,528
Reactors one and two
ready to go, sir.

232
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,170
Last man down. Hatch secure.

233
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,727
Captain in control.

234
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,368
Officer of the deck, submerge the ship.

235
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,726
Submerge the ship. Aye, Captain.

236
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,769
Fifteen degree down bubble,
all ahead full.

237
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,001
Make your depth 300 feet.

238
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,247
Aye, sir.

239
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,560
Depth set to 300 feet.

240
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,005
Fifteen degrees down bubble.

241
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,801
Dive! Dive!

242
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,330
Welcome to Polyarny, Mr. President.

243
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,562
Good to see you, Dmitri.

244
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,923
- Has Washington made contact?
- They have.

245
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,085
We thought it best to await your arrival
before responding.

246
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,882
Okay. Let them wait.

247
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,526
Short and sweet, gentlemen.

248
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,251
We're gonna be the eyes and ears
for some people inside the Beltway.

249
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,960
Yeah, a bunch of suits
sipping chai lattes.

250
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,168
Maybe, but Fisk vouched for this one.

251
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,289
- No shit.
- Living the dream.

252
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,206
If it doesn't suck, we don't do it.

253
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,322
Hey, Martinelli,
tags and personal effects.

254
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,000
You telling me this is unofficial?

255
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,202
We get caught on the wrong
side of the fence, we never existed.

256
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,405
You're new, so a little advice.

257
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,481
Don't be that guy.

258
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,562
<i>What gm!”-?</i>

259
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,685
You got a beautiful sister, Martinelli.

260
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,682
She spoken for?

261
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,366
She's not my sister, sir.

262
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,691
It doesn't matter where Seaman's from.

263
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,128
- Report on contacts.
- No immediate contacts.

264
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,442
Park.

265
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,250
Forty miles from the Russian coast, sir.

266
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,206
We should be right on top of her.

267
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,610
We might not be the first ones here.

268
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,042
Captain?

269
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,925
XO, deploy the sea scan.

270
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,725
Deploy sea scan. Aye, Captain.

271
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,202
Deploy the sea scan.
Set scope at 1,000 knots.

272
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,847
Sir, I'm picking up something.

273
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,762
Could be a debris field.

274
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,763
Could be vents on the sea floor.

275
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,041
Or a deep water reef.

276
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,484
It wouldn't affect the magnetic field.

277
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,241
There she is.

278
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,562
Jesus.

279
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,691
Jimenez, maneuver the sea scan
towards the bow.

280
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,961
She was torpedoed.

281
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,881
- Cob, man battle stations.
- Man battle stations, aye.

282
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,447
Flood tubes one and two.
Open outer doors on tube two.

283
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,487
Man battle stations.

284
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,686
<i>Man battle stations.</i>

285
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,004
- Okay, open the breach door.
- Forward clear!

286
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,804
Engine room, engine room,
somebody get these...

287
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,361
Come on, come on, let's go!

288
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,450
Flood tubes one, two, three, four.

289
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,407
Flood tubes, aye.

290
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,041
Secure torpedo rigs.

291
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,282
Open outer doors! Go! Go! Go!

292
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,524
Draft a message for next comms window.

293
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,887
"USS Tampa Bay sunk by enemy action."

294
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,087
Yes, sir.

295
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,930
Tubes one and two ready for launch.

296
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,771
Engine room, cap and rig
for maximum reliability.

297
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,562
Captain? You should hear this.

298
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,605
Tell me that's coming from Tampa Bay.

299
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,561
Get me a bearing.

300
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,090
Bearing 2-2-1, clear as a bell.

301
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,771
Steer course 2-2-1.

302
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,927
Steering course 2-2-1.

303
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,401
Mr. Edwards, get that robot
back on board ASAP.

304
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,001
Recall the sea scan.

305
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,321
What the hell is that?

306
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,722
New contact, Captain.

307
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,325
Detecting auxiliary noises overhead.

308
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,530
Somebody's ice-picked up there.

309
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,761
They're right on top of us.

310
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,723
Distance 8-5-0.

311
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,250
The American sub is increasing speed.

312
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,445
Fire torpedoes one and two.

313
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,210
Bearing 0-4-5, O-4-6...

314
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,640
Torpedoes in the water!

315
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,562
They fired at us?

316
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,127
Inbound, best bearing 1-9-0 and closing.

317
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,281
Pilot, take her to manual.

318
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,691
Left full rudder, all ahead flank.

319
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,330
Launch evasion devices.

320
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,209
Captain, torpedoes are chasing
countermeasure.

321
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,522
Give them new coordinates.

322
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,731
Snapshot, prepare to fire tube one
on the bearing of enemy contact.

323
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,609
- Ship ready!
- Solution ready!

324
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,682
Weapon ready!

325
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,088
Match sonar bearings and fire!

326
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,609
Normal launch! Torpedo course 2-1-9!

327
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,087
Captain, torpedo bearing 3-0-0.

328
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,930
- It passed under us.
- It won't find us in the ice.

329
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,128
There's a lot of interference
on the surface, Captain.

330
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,281
Hard to find her in the noise.

331
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,523
Pull up towed array
past appropriate gauge.

332
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,884
Weps, turn weapon 180 degrees.

333
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,930
Reduce search depth to 40 feet.

334
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,365
Reduce depth to 40 feet. Aye, Captain.

335
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,644
Equalize the air vents seven to ten!

336
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,449
- There she is.
- Holy shit.

337
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,760
Eyes on enemy contact.

338
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,646
Captain, it's a hit!

339
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,210
Get those headphones back on, Belford.

340
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,211
Pilot, zero bubble, maintain flank speed.

341
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,688
Captain, enemy torpedoes
still active and closing!

342
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,730
Nav, report the bearing to Tampa Bay.

343
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,961
We're going to run straight at her.

344
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,042
<i>Tampa Bay, sin'?</i>

345
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,088
If I have to say everything twice,
we're not going to make it.

346
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,208
- Report the bearing!
- Yes, sir. 0-1-0.

347
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,727
Pilot, steady course 0-1-0,
40 degree down bubble.

348
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,086
0-1-0, 40 down. Aye, Captain.

349
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,323
Now, when I tell you,
pull up with everything.

350
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,401
Sounding 300 feet.

351
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,321
Two-five-zero!

352
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,090
- 200 feet.
- Red sounding.

353
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,087
- Red sounding.
- One-five-zero!

354
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,407
One hundred feet!

355
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,288
- Repeat red sounding!
- Seventy-five! Fifty feet!

356
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,801
- Forty feet!
- Captain!

357
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,850
Thirty feet! Two-five.
Twenty feet!

358
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,887
Pull up. Zero bubble.

359
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,166
Torpedo's 200 feet!

360
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,484
- Skipper, suggest we...
- Hold her. Stay on the floor.

361
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,449
- Terminal homing, Captain!
- Right full rudder!

362
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,851
Right full rudder. Aye, Captain.

363
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,723
- Everybody all right?
- Aye.

364
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,762
I'm okay.

365
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,007
Did we just start a war?

366
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,881
No, but we might have sailed into one.

367
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,282
Captain?

368
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,761
Somebody's still down there, sir.

369
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,330
President, Minister Durov.

370
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,244
They sunk our submarine <i>Volkov.</i>

371
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,005
What the hell are the Americans doing?

372
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,530
We must respond immediately
to protect the sovereignty of Russia.

373
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,931
Sir, I recommend we launch Yevchenko
to sweep for American submarines.

374
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,290
I want to speak
with the American president.

375
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,891
Sir, message from USS Arkansas.

376
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,009
I got a Rear Admiral without enough sense
to get out of the rain.

377
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,203
Sir, we've got a shootout under the ice.

378
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,482
Two Russian, one American.

379
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,090
What's the response from Moscow?

380
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,290
Nothing. Nothing to the Pentagon
or the State Department, sir.

381
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,203
And we know they've been
conducting exercises

382
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,521
with the Northern Fleet
over the last few weeks.

383
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,410
Exercises, my ass.

384
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,127
President Zakarin is already in Polyarny.

385
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,811
Move the closest carrier battle group
into position.

386
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,125
Yes, sir. And you should know,

387
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,761
we have special operators en route
to determine Zakarin's intentions.

388
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,323
Admiral Fisk,
I don't think I need to explain

389
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,289
to a war hero such as yourself,

390
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,089
but when someone is shooting at you,

391
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,046
you know their intentions.

392
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,526
Let's gear up, fellas!

393
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,570
Shit, is that lightning?

394
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,611
Hey, Martinelli, quit the chatter!

395
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,487
Go, go, go!

396
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,087
Martinelli!

397
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,804
Slow down. Slow down, little brother.

398
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,248
What's your name?
Come on, what's your name?

399
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,247
Thursday.

400
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,681
Fuck.

401
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,766
It's another <i>Akula,</i> Captain.

402
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,361
Damage to the bow.

403
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,410
Probably on impact with the sea floor.

404
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,291
Tampa Bay took her down with her.

405
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,204
<i>Tampa</i> Bay didn't fire on anyone.

406
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,927
Captain?

407
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,610
Her torpedo doors were closed.

408
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,402
Jesus.

409
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,771
How does anyone live through that?

410
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,442
Ever seen a blast signature like this, XO?

411
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,531
Until today, I hadn't seen
any torpedoed submarines.

412
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,006
You're not seeing one here.

413
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,726
Look at the skin of the hull.

414
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,364
The shrapnel patterns are pointing out.

415
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,448
You used to light cherry bombs
as a kid, right?

416
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,684
You and I had very different childhoods.

417
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,886
We used to set them off in car tailpipes.

418
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,046
Make slivers like those.

419
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,042
That explosion came from inside the sub.

420
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,406
Her torpedoes cooked off?

421
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,161
They're not that far aft.
Not even on an Akula.

422
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,604
Nav, report bottom depth.

423
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,241
Can we get them out?

424
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,203
762 feet, Captain.

425
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,801
That's touch and go, sir.

426
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,451
They took out Tampa Bay.
They don't deserve a rescue.

427
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,485
They were following somebody's orders,
Reed.

428
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,451
Captain, we just torpedoed
a sub in their water.

429
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,921
The Russians will respond with
a search party on high alert.

430
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,126
That would be logical, yeah.

431
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,970
But if they were behaving logically,

432
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,525
they would've tried their own rescue,

433
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,281
not fired on us.

434
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,683
Look, nobody's following the playbook.

435
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,205
We don't know what's going on up top.

436
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,682
The only people who might have a clue
are down there on that ocean floor.

437
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,365
Yeah, Russians, sir,

438
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,969
who, for all we know, just sunk Tampa Bay!

439
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,041
Exactly my point.

440
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,009
We don't know, XO, but they might.

441
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,250
And for some reason,
their comrades have left them for dead.

442
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,288
This is in direct violation
of our mission objective.

443
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,202
Noted.

444
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,762
<i>Cob, launch the Mystic.</i>

445
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,285
Launch the <i>Mystic.</i> Aye, Captain.

446
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,930
Put her down on the forward escape trunk.

447
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,604
I want those Russian sailors outta there.

448
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,842
Sir, at the very least,
we need to contact 6th Fleet.

449
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,161
And they'll be dead
by the time we get an answer!

450
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,485
Have commo draft a message,

451
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,806
but I'm not waiting for a reply.

452
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,042
Aye, Captain.

453
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,560
<i>Arkansas, Mystic.</i>

454
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,368
Flooding and equalizing skirt
for undocking.

455
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,849
Mating latch, released.

456
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,242
Couple of feet deeper,
and we get crushed like a beer can.

457
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,526
The currents are strong, cabrén.

458
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,844
- Four knots, 1-5-0.
- Copy that.

459
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,881
Speed, 0.2.

460
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,881
Five feet.

461
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,842
God damn it.

462
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,560
- Two feet.
- We're stuck in a riptide!

463
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,921
And locked.

464
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,122
I'm Commander Glass of USS Arkansas.

465
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,289
XO, have these men treated
for hypothermia by the Doc.

466
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,486
But keep them placed under guard.

467
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,364
Until we hear something from above,
these men are prisoners of war.

468
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,162
Cob.

469
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,331
Separate the Captain from his men.

470
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,805
I want him kept in isolation.

471
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,727
Aye, Captain.

472
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,242
Nellie is away.

473
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,444
<i>Hey, boss, what's your sitrep?</i>

474
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,329
Got some heavy ordnance down there.

475
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,846
They're loading destroyers.

476
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,489
Pulling up to a tin can right now.

477
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,722
Well, make it look good.

478
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,490
These pictures are going live
to Washington.

479
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,450
Oh, yeah, we're famous.

480
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,606
Why aren't we getting a clear picture?

481
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,603
Something's giving us interference.

482
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,523
We're having trouble making a connection,
ma'am.

483
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,850
- Uh, can I, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

484
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,651
They're using a signal jammer.

485
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,888
Sir. Sir.

486
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,650
All cellular channels are blocked.

487
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,728
I cannot reach Washington or Moscow.

488
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,681
What's going on?

489
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,006
Tell them to try frequency 2282.5 MHz.

490
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,441
- Ma'am?
- 2282.5 MHz.

491
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,691
The NSA has a few satellite frequencies
that we don't normally share.

492
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,691
But we're all on the same team here,
right?

493
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,242
Yeah.

494
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,442
Okay-

495
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,486
Got it!

496
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,001
Those guys are good.

497
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,007
Who is that? Can you zoom in, please?

498
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,050
- We're losing them.
- On the drone.

499
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,722
That's Durov.

500
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,529
Russian Minister of Defense.

501
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,685
I see the presidential helicopter.

502
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,761
I don't see Zakarin.

503
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,562
He's up here.

504
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,286
Can we get a closer look?

505
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,641
What are you up to?

506
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,051
Why are they launching the destroyer?

507
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,121
This is an outrage, Minister.

508
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,003
I'm cut off from all my command structures
in Moscow.

509
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,484
I need a secure emergency line
opened immediately!

510
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,363
Sir, we may be under threat

511
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,851
from an imminent attack.

512
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,891
I've sealed off the base

513
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,448
and shut down all communications

514
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,521
as a security precaution.

515
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,920
That is not your decision to make.

516
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,441
I must inform my ministers, my Parliament,

517
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,721
and my Generals.

518
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,046
I've spoken to them,

519
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,440
and I told them

520
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,967
that you are indisposed and in my care.

521
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,561
That's enough of this.

522
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,290
- Dmitri?
- From now on,

523
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,644
all military orders will come from me.

524
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,529
The military won't follow your orders.

525
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,567
They have no choice.

526
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,171
As far as they're concerned,

527
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,650
every order I give
will have come from you.

528
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,604
I'm your Minister of Defense,

529
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,362
and I intend to defend
our interests and our country

530
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,682
from any threat, inside or out.

531
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,003
Even those from a weak leader.

532
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,642
Really?

533
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,089
- You'll be executed for this.
- No, Nicolai.

534
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,168
By the time anyone knows what's happened,

535
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,165
the nation will be at war.

536
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,929
And concerned only with victory.

537
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,569
Everything else will be forgotten.

538
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,685
Hey, buddy, you seeing this?

539
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,522
Gimme some audio.

540
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,362
Admiral.

541
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,564
Are we getting sound?
Can you turn that up?

542
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,682
Oh, my God.

543
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,642
Shit.

544
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,687
It's a coup.

545
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,531
I need to brief the president.

546
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,601
He's gonna recommend moving the fleet
into position, isn't he?

547
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,284
He's going to play the hand
he's been dealt.

548
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,361
You know what that means.

549
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,930
How well do you know
the men on the ground?

550
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,808
What about reaching out to
the Russian military directly?

551
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,849
Whatever happened down there,
Madam President,

552
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,570
Durov has made us look like the aggressor.

553
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,563
To his own people
and the rest of the world.

554
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,041
- Can we prove this is a coup?
- The facts are simple.

555
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,607
Durov is moving his fleet
to a war footing.

556
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,842
We let them gain a tactical advantage now,

557
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,287
no one's ever going to remember
who threw the first punch.

558
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,045
I recommend that we deploy
the carrier group

559
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,122
and raise our status to DEFCON 2.

560
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,687
Excuse me, Admiral. I'm sorry.

561
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,929
We may be playing right
into Durov's hands.

562
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,809
I think he wants our fleets to engage.

563
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,844
What are you saying,
he wants an all-out war?

564
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,851
I'm saying that I think
it's all choreographed.

565
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,210
The Russian constitution stipulates

566
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,725
that if a president is indisposed

567
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,245
during a time of active hostilities,

568
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,210
all authority falls
to the Russian Minister.

569
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,126
Anybody start World War Ill
just to grab power...

570
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,042
That's my point.

571
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,011
It's not a standoff with Russia.

572
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,208
We're dealing with
a single rogue minister.

573
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,890
So this may be a coup without
any deep support within the military.

574
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,088
Can we go after Durov? Bunker-buster?

575
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,400
That might kill Zakarin.

576
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,571
Which I think is why Durov
is keeping him alive.

577
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,610
Miss Norquist, this sounds like
excellent analysis for a history book,

578
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,648
but we won't be the ones
writing that book,

579
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,404
unless we respond now!

580
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,401
They attacked us and killed 110 Americans!

581
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,847
They don't want an all-out war
any more than we do.

582
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,844
Madam President, when somebody makes
a move on a chessboard,

583
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,126
you respond!

584
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,281
Maybe we don't have a choice.

585
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,643
What if we could free President Zakarin?

586
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,967
Madam President, we don't have...

587
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,962
No. Let him speak.

588
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,722
Thank you, Madam.

589
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,202
We have a team outside the base
at Polyarny.

590
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,849
And a submarine off the coast.

591
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,560
The pieces are in place
for a rescue and exfil.

592
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,005
I know the men involved.

593
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,242
If we can deliver Zakarin to Moscow,

594
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,800
he could cut this off.

595
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,487
We rescue the Russian president?

596
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,847
We may not like Zakarin,
but he's better than Durov.

597
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,721
We'd be at war.

598
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,490
Admiral, take us to DEFCON 2.

599
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,561
Move the carrier fleet into position.

600
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,246
We need to be prepared to confront Durov.

601
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,809
But I wanna do everything possible
to avoid this.

602
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,041
Your rescue attempt has my authorization
as well.

603
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,807
Men, we've been ordered to Polyarny base.

604
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,806
The Murmansk Fjord?
How far in are we going?

605
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,441
Right up to her doorstep.

606
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,648
It's heavily defended by destroyers.

607
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,091
Half the Russian fleet's there.

608
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,685
Top priority orders, XO.

609
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,044
Admiral Durov is staging a coup.

610
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,563
We're going in to get four of our boys.

611
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,887
And one Russian president.

612
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,803
Nav, get me the latest charts and intel

613
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,802
on those mine fields.

614
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,280
Aye, Captain.

615
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,091
Weps, have the torpedo
and fire control systems double-checked.

616
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,764
Torpedo and fire control systems
double-checked.

617
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,446
- Make your depth 400 feet, pilot.
- Making depth 400 feet. Aye, Captain.

618
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,005
Sir, that fjord is mined,

619
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,128
it's covered in sensors and sonar fields.

620
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,205
No matter how many precautions we take,

621
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,169
it won't be enough
to get us through undetected.

622
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,521
You're right, XO.

623
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,570
That's why we need a local navigator.

624
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,640
Does he know where he is?

625
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,961
He does. He just can't believe it.

626
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,122
Okay, leave us.

627
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,205
I'm sorry about your men.

628
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,531
We've crossed paths before, you and I.

629
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,606
<i>I was on the Baton Rouge</i>

630
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,250
when we brushed past you off Greenland.

631
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,008
I've read your file, Captain.
I know you speak English.

632
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,568
Fuck you.

633
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,125
Okay. Very good, now we're talking.

634
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,367
I have nothing to say.

635
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,442
We did not fire on your submarine,
Captain.

636
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,202
No one did.

637
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,761
You don't believe me?

638
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,601
Here, look at this.

639
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,085
You blew up from the inside out.

640
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,166
You were sabotaged.

641
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,441
Why do you show this to me?

642
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,561
I do not cooperate with enemy.
I am no traitor.

643
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,687
No.

644
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,846
I'm not saying you are a traitor.

645
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,287
The traitor is the man
who blew up your sub.

646
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,561
The traitor's the man responsible for
the deaths of all those young sailors:

647
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,527
Admiral Durov.

648
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,960
Durov is holding your president hostage
at Polyarny,

649
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,165
and we've been ordered to sail through
the Murmansk Fjord to rescue him.

650
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,369
I can't do that without your help.

651
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,730
I trained the men at Polyarny.

652
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,011
I will not help you to kill them.

653
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,684
We're not trying to kill your men.

654
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,644
We're only trying to rescue
your president...

655
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,609
...and maybe put a stop to this.

656
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,845
You know, we're no different, you and I.

657
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,370
We've been down here our whole careers.

658
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,881
Toe-to-toe.

659
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,765
We're not enemies, we're brothers.

660
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,401
Who else understands
what it is we go through?

661
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,523
The isolation, the fear.

662
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,887
Riding for months inside a bomb
scraping at the bottom of the ocean.

663
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,201
But it's what we are. It's what we do.

664
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,966
So you know what it took for me
to get you out of that sub?

665
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,684
I risked my men. I risked my ship.

666
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,361
I risked a court-martial.

667
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,211
Because it was the right thing to do.

668
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,049
It's not about your side or my side.

669
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,920
This is about our future.

670
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,324
Sir, we picked up
an unauthorized transmission.

671
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,449
2282.5 MHZ.

672
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,041
It's going out from near the base.

673
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,642
Find it.

674
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,085
So, what's the situation, boss?

675
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,650
I just got orders
from Washington.

676
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,846
Incoming. Ten o'clock.

677
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,002
Shit.

678
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,802
We gotta go.

679
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,401
What is this?

680
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,521
Oh.

681
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,611
We got you. We got you, come on.

682
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,086
It missed the bone, but I don't think
he's gonna run a marathon anytime soon.

683
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,884
Okay, listen up.

684
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,724
I've got some good news and bad news.

685
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,166
On the plus side,
we don't have to hike to Norway.

686
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,085
United States Navy is sending us

687
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,561
our very own nuclear submarine
to give us a ride out.

688
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,041
- A U.S. sub? Up here?
- Yeah.

689
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,962
There's a catch.

690
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,006
We gotta grab the Russian president
and take him with us.

691
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,761
Shit.

692
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,087
Zakafln?

693
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,967
Thought we hated that guy.

694
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,884
Yeah, well, I guess things changed.

695
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,171
Look, I know it's a big ask, but...

696
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,647
I get the feeling that
if we don't pull this off,

697
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,240
things could get ugly.

698
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,287
- Like real ugly.
- Yeah, fuck it.

699
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,923
I'd rather go kick some ass
than sit up here

700
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,365
freezing my nuts off, anyway.

701
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,962
What about Marty?

702
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,921
I got other plans for you.

703
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,043
Captain, we're holding outside the fjord.

704
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,801
Awaiting your orders.

705
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,682
Very well.

706
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,410
Execute final preps, XO.

707
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,881
Aye, sir.

708
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,402
How's the crew?

709
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,721
They wouldn't say it, sir,

710
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,210
but I've been with these men a long time.

711
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,327
They're terrified.

712
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,608
Mmm.

713
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,367
And what about you?

714
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,011
Twenty-two years I've been at this.

715
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,441
I've never been shot at.

716
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,961
I can't say I liked it.

717
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,522
Me neither. Just between us.

718
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,881
All due respect, sir.

719
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,727
You just keep leading.

720
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,091
Let us do the worrying.

721
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,803
Okay. Let's go get the crew ready.

722
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,286
Captain in control.

723
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,124
Warship Arkansas, this is your captain.

724
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,770
<i>We're going into the Murmansk Fjord.</i>

725
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,400
<i>Go over the boat's power plant</i>

726
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,765
<i>and the ship's noise signature.</i>

727
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,081
<i>I want this baby so quiet,
fish 'II bump into her.</i>

728
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,561
- Ooh-rah, Arkansas.
- Ooh-rah!

729
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,604
XO, take her in nice and slow.

730
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,720
Pilot, steady course 1-7-0.

731
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,362
All ahead two-thirds.

732
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,210
Course 1-7-0...

733
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,127
Sonar, ears open for sound sensors.

734
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,491
Yes, sir. All ahead two-thirds.

735
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,846
Steer course 1-4-6.

736
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,601
1-4-6.

737
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,441
1-4-4.

738
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,521
- Captain.
- Mark your depth.

739
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,763
- All stop.
- Halt all engines.

740
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,447
All engines off.

741
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,202
Men, this is Captain Andropov

742
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,931
<i>of the RFS Konek.</i>

743
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,842
He's our guest.

744
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,764
XO, set him up.

745
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,200
What's the matter?

746
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,364
You never seen a Russian captain before?

747
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,966
Eyes on your stations.

748
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,202
Sir.

749
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,084
These systems are classified.

750
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,922
I know.

751
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,641
You speak Russian, Park?

752
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,447
Ask him if he knows the captain
that shot down Tampa Bay.

753
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,290
He trained him to do his job,
Reed. Now, you do yours.

754
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,249
This is the most reckless thing
I've ever seen.

755
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,206
Captain, recommend
we confine the Russian captain

756
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,202
until we return to Faslane...

757
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,930
Let me clue you all in on something.

758
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,045
Now, we've been ordered to cross waters

759
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,407
that no American sub
has ever crossed before.

760
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,721
When you look at him,

761
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,809
you shouldn't see anything other than
a sailor in his own backyard.

762
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,280
Now, we saved his life.

763
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,042
I figure the odds are at least even
that he's going to save ours, too.

764
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,643
- Captain...
- This is absurd!

765
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,567
The arrogance of this,
for you to bring him in here!

766
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,681
You will be court-martialed!

767
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,249
Then it's my job to keep you alive
long enough so you can testify.

768
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:36,882
Captain.

769
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,041
Pilot, all ahead one-third.

770
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,370
Steer course 1-6-0.

771
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,649
Aye, sir. All ahead one-third.

772
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,604
There's a cliff just off
the port bow, Captain,

773
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,330
bearing 1-1-0 at 400 yards.

774
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,926
Nav, stay as close as you can
to the rocks without scraping the paint.

775
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,362
Aye, Captain.

776
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,967
- Pilot, steer course 1-5-2.
- Steer course 1-5-2.

777
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,964
XO, take us along the ocean floor.

778
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,691
Set your altitude to 20 feet.

779
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,761
Yes, Captain.

780
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,406
Pilot, 15 degrees down bubble.

781
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,042
Here.

782
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,250
- Sound sensors.
- Silence, men. Not a breath.

783
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,642
All stations calm.
Set condition ultra-quiet.

784
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,725
Acoustic-detonating mines.

785
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,805
How are we supposed to get past those?

786
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,321
There's another way.

787
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,562
Here.

788
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,281
He's leading us into a dead end, Captain.
Look at the chart.

789
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,601
Your chart is wrong.

790
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,241
There's passage.

791
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,201
Where is this passage?

792
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,361
<i>Sleva, left.</i>

793
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,567
0-7-0.

794
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,407
Now.

795
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,529
- Left full rudder, 0-7-0.
- 0-7-0.

796
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,131
There's no sign of passage, Captain.

797
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,406
There's no way through.

798
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,685
We're going to run straight into a wall.

799
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,569
Captain, we have to reverse engines.

800
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,961
XO, if you can't take it,
confine yourself.

801
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:15,962
Hang on.

802
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,406
There it is. There's an opening.

803
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,641
Through the choke point.

804
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,241
Open seas ahead.

805
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,842
XO, what's better...

806
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,321
To be right or to be alive?

807
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,203
Aye, sir. Ready for orders.

808
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,601
XO has the Conn.

809
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:48,882
Okay, boys.

810
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:53,285
We go in, snatch the Russian president,
take a quick refreshing swim,

811
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,569
and then rendezvous with a U.S. sub.
Nothing to it.

812
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,762
- Sounds like a walk in the park, boss.
- Yeah.

813
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,170
What are we gonna do about Martinelli?

814
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,089
When we're done, if I'm still alive,

815
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:06,962
I'll come back for him.

816
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,689
We're dropping into a goddamn coup,
aren't we?

817
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,881
Don't ask me.

818
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,445
I don't know shit about politics.

819
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,402
Let's go swimming.

820
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,088
Whoa.

821
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,568
Take it easy, buddy. Take her easy.

822
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,524
- Who are you?
- Search and Rescue.

823
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,606
Off the grid. Three ghosts.

824
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,407
- Why are you here?
- You know more than we do.

825
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,008
We got a ride out of trouble
for your president,

826
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,081
if we can get to him.

827
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,281
In a few hours' time,

828
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,084
both our navies are
going to go head-to-head,

829
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,241
and it's gonna get ugly.

830
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,524
We're just two assholes out in the cold.

831
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,731
This is all riding on us.

832
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:38,880
I can get you to him.

833
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,121
Fix him up.

834
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,607
Minister, the fleet awaits
your orders, sir.

835
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,482
There.

836
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,886
Fire in the hole.

837
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,881
Get him up!

838
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,486
Gimme your hands, sir.

839
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,449
Gimme your hands.

840
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,002
Hold steady!

841
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,845
- He's an American.
- He's here to free us.

842
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,605
Yeah, I don't like it either, sir.
Come on, let's go!

843
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,926
I've got these two up front.

844
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,847
Man down!

845
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,521
Man down!

846
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,327
Cover me!

847
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,442
Clear!

848
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:27,562
Follow me!

849
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,801
- Come on, follow me!
- Come on!

850
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,282
Oleg!

851
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,489
- Come on!
- Go! Go!

852
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,650
- Wait there, sir.
- Hall!

853
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,610
On the ledge, sir. On the ledge.

854
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,481
Go, sir! Go!

855
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,124
- Give me weapon, soldier.
- Shit.

856
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,162
We gotta move.

857
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,206
Fuck you.

858
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,686
Jesus Christ, Johnstone!

859
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,362
Go! Go! Go!

860
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,887
Move!

861
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,528
Come on! No!

862
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,770
God damn it, Hall! Hall! Come on!

863
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,802
Billy, we lost him.

864
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,323
God damn it.

865
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,362
They're coming.

866
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,681
We gotta swim. Come on!

867
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,607
The orders are for four Americans
and one Russian civilian.

868
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,922
There aren't too many
training simulations for this one.

869
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,766
- Roger that.
- All right. Go.

870
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,050
All systems checked.

871
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,722
Ready to disconnect.

872
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,723
<i>Mystic, Conn. Ship is all yours.</i>

873
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,530
Move! Move! Come on, move!

874
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,643
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

875
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,245
Come on!

876
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,367
Go!

877
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,561
Come on, let's go!

878
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,321
Come on!

879
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,282
Dive!

880
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,042
Stay down!

881
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:58,922
Stay down!

882
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,042
Stay down!

883
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,044
He's hit! He's hit!

884
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,362
Come on, let's go!

885
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,605
Go! Go!

886
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,490
Keep moving, sir! Come on!

887
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,927
Come on, let's go! Go!

888
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,406
Come on!

889
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,246
Keep moving, Mr. President.

890
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,531
- Come on!
- Come on.

891
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,487
Please, sir.

892
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,762
Come on!

893
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,607
Where the hell is she?

894
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:47,962
There she is!

895
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,202
Okay, Mr. President...

896
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,842
Come on!

897
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,241
Down. Here we go.

898
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,767
Come on, Johnstone! Dive!

899
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,761
Take a deep breath, sir.

900
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,125
Too long. They're taking too long.

901
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,850
He's not fucking coming, bro.
He's not gonna come.

902
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,402
Shit!

903
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,687
Grab him by the arms!

904
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,722
Come on, pull him!

905
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,806
Come on, get him out!

906
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,004
Hey. Hey, where are the others?

907
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,566
Seal the hatch! We gotta go, come on!

908
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,961
You seal it.

909
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,528
<i>Minister Durov, the Americans escaped.</i>

910
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,090
<i>- And the president?
- Americans took him.</i>

911
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,920
<i>If he's alive, he's in their sub.</i>

912
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,526
Seal the fjord!

913
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,085
Sink the American submarine
before she escapes!

914
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,369
Captain, I'm picking up
a faint 300 MHz tonal.

915
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,441
Heavy screw beat.

916
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,642
Is it domestic?

917
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,411
No, sir.
Sounds like an auxiliary.

918
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,322
It's on the surface.

919
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,481
That's a warship.

920
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,969
That's Yevchenko, a destroyer.

921
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,369
I trained the men myself.
They will not miss.

922
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,045
Pressure's building rapidly.

923
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,963
The deeper we go, the more leaks we get.

924
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,370
I got the beacon! Real weak.

925
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,611
Set bearing 0-3-1
to intercept with Arkansas.

926
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,451
Mama, this is baby.
Hold on to your signal.

927
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,164
Depth 1-7-0. Coming around now.

928
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,409
Captain, Harbor Control reports

929
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,006
- a contact at the magnetic sensors.
- That's her!

930
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,489
Launch rocket mortars
on the designated bearing!

931
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,042
It won't take much more.
We're almost home.

932
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,403
Mystic, Conn. We have <i>visual</i> contact.

933
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,845
Oh, that is a pretty sight.

934
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,042
- Mystic, Conn.
- Shit!

935
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,526
<i>Mating hatch is ready for launch.</i>

936
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,642
Come on!

937
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,881
Baby, touchdown!

938
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,242
Engaging latch! Drain the hatch now!

939
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,168
Go! Hurry up! Move!
Get the hell out of here! Go!

940
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,404
Rocket mortar splashes close range!

941
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,845
Sound the collision alarm! Lock it down!

942
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,008
- All ahead flank!
- All ahead flank. Aye, Captain.

943
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,483
Let's go! Keep going!
Keep going! Keep going!

944
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,131
Prep room for triage.

945
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,531
Patient has gunshot wounds.

946
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,886
Ten seconds since splashes!

947
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,161
<i>Captain, the Mystics not secure.</i>

948
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,083
- We're gonna rip her right off.
- Fire the explosive bolts!

949
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,640
- Jettison that thing now!
- Jettisoning the Mystic. Aye, Captain.

950
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,563
Fifteen seconds
since mortar splashes!

951
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,441
Hatch secure!

952
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,245
Twenty seconds since mortar splash!

953
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,321
Rig for impact!

954
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,166
Rig ship for impact!

955
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,925
Pilot, steady the boat!

956
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,246
Left full rudder! Steady course 0-1-0.

957
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,847
Left full rudder! Aye, Captain!
Heading 0-1-0!

958
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,201
We got a leak!

959
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,771
Park, you okay?

960
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,082
Come on, buddy, get up.
Get up. You're fine.

961
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,165
Belford, where the hell's that destroyer?

962
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,082
I can't find her, sir.

963
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,764
It'll be a minute for
the blast circle to die down.

964
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,365
If we can't hear her, sir,
she can't hear us.

965
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,329
All right, well, then let's see
if we can slip out of here.

966
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,363
Pilot, all ahead one-third, minimum amps.

967
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,282
Cob, damage report.

968
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,521
Fire in the main switchboard.

969
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,046
Flooding in the torpedo room.
We're taking on water.

970
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,282
Captain? Picking up contact.

971
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,607
Bearing 2-2-1. They're shallow.

972
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:08,640
All ahead flank!
I want that sub on the floor!

973
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,601
Here they come.

974
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,809
Get ready to dive fast and hard.

975
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,083
They're firing! Torpedoes in the water!

976
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:39,284
Launch evasion devices! Dive!
60 degree down bubble!

977
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,646
60 degree down bubble. Aye, sir.

978
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,688
Bottom depth 7-9-5!

979
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,609
Bottom depth 7-9-5! Thank you, Captain.

980
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,011
Contact on destroyer!

981
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,410
Yevchenko bearing 0-2-1!
They're closing fast.

982
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,925
Firing port procedures.

983
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,368
Prepare to fire tube one on bearing 0-2-1.

984
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,481
Prepare to fire. Aye, Captain.

985
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,721
Bearing 0-2-1.

986
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,525
- Ship ready!
- Solution ready!

987
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:05,762
Weapon ready!

988
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,482
Hold your fire.

989
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,561
Holding fire, aye.

990
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,890
There's still one coming,
bearing 3-5-5 and closing!

991
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,606
- We're gonna hit the bottom!
- Port main engine overheating!

992
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,887
- Sir, do we fire back?
- I said hold your fire.

993
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,241
Depth to sea floor?

994
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,129
Depth 1-5-0 feet under the keel.

995
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,362
- Pull back to zero bubble!
- Forward trim.

996
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,688
Captain? Ls the bottom soft?

997
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,445
Yes, Captain. Mud.

998
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,564
Okay, bring me down to it,
and do it quickly.

999
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,242
We're gonna lie on the bottom
like a catfish.

1000
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,011
One hundred feet!

1001
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,442
Seventy-five!

1002
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,484
Five-zero feet! All back emergency!

1003
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,641
Brace for impact!

1004
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,802
Twenty-five feet! Fifteen feet!

1005
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:05,004
- Five feet!
- Impact!

1006
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,205
Oh, Christ. Get that up.

1007
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:23,202
IUSS has detected explosions
just outside Polyarny.

1008
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,641
Is she down?

1009
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,169
- Is she sunk?
- Can't confirm, sir.

1010
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:32,480
God damn it!

1011
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,683
Bring the fleet to battle readiness.

1012
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,360
We're going to DEFCON 1.

1013
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,410
Fisk, the president's going
to be calling our NATO allies,

1014
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:44,201
and she will have to explain
how Zakarin died in our hands!

1015
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,161
Do you understand what you did?

1016
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,962
If Durov didn't have
all of Russia behind him before,

1017
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,646
he sure as shit will now,
and everybody else on earth!

1018
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:53,926
As far as they know,

1019
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,971
we kidnapped the Russian president
and we killed him!

1020
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,727
You didn't just start a war today...

1021
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,241
You lost it, too.

1022
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,843
Minister, our ships will have visual
on the Americans momentarily.

1023
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,925
Good. Tell them to engage.

1024
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:57,922
Yes, sir.

1025
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,401
What the hell is that?

1026
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,888
The rest of the Russian fleet
are moving into position.

1027
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,810
They're responding to our movements.

1028
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,765
We're leading them into the fight.

1029
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,885
We have captured the American.

1030
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,446
Waiting for our orders.

1031
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,961
<i>Execute him.</i>

1032
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,442
You came back.

1033
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,246
Yeah, I needed the exercise.

1034
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,646
Hey! Hey!

1035
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,682
You did good, kid. You did real good.

1036
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,008
What do you say we get the hell
out of here? Come on!

1037
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,090
Fuck.

1038
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,165
Destroyer's bearing off, Captain.

1039
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,641
All right, everybody check your gear
for proper function.

1040
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,924
- Aye, Captain.
- Sonar's still active.

1041
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,809
XO, you have the Conn.

1042
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,007
I have the Conn. Aye, Captain.

1043
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,162
Mr. President.

1044
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,648
Captain Andropov says
you are a man I can trust.

1045
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,206
I must speak with my generals.

1046
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,247
Once they find out the truth,
they'll stop Durov.

1047
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,001
I understand, sir.

1048
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,208
But once we rise to communication depth,

1049
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,085
you won't be alive to tell that story.

1050
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,964
- Damage report.
- Fires contained.

1051
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,328
Flooding is slow,
but we're still taking on water.

1052
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,927
Weps, what's the situation
in the torpedo room?

1053
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,968
- It's bad, Captain.
- Then get down there.

1054
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:27,882
Aye, sir.

1055
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,562
Shit! McCaw, give me a status report!

1056
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,130
Weapons damage to tube one.

1057
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,611
We're leaking, but we're working on it!

1058
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,485
God damn it!

1059
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,447
All right, you go.

1060
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,401
Cob, torpedo room.

1061
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,724
It's two feet above
the deck plates, Captain.

1062
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,242
<i>Damage to tube one.</i>

1063
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,085
- Make tube two ready.
- Aye, sir!

1064
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,525
Load torpedo four in tube two. Go!

1065
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,728
All right, come on, guys.
Let's get this done, all right?

1066
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,041
Shit!

1067
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:00,930
- Man under! Man under!
- Man under!

1068
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,365
- Come on!
- Move it! Come on!

1069
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,162
Captain.

1070
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,249
The destroyer's0yer's circled back and closing,
Captain.

1071
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,682
What range?

1072
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,770
She's closing fast.
Five hundred yards out.

1073
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:52,766
- Kaplan!
- You all right?

1074
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:58,802
Captain.

1075
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,201
Conn, torpedo room! Tube two damaged!

1076
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,126
- Is any tube operational?
- Negative, Captain!

1077
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,531
<i>All tubes out of commission.</i>

1078
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:15,528
Captain.

1079
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,241
They've locked on.

1080
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,042
We're sitting ducks.

1081
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,442
You say you trained the men
on that destroyer, Captain?

1082
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,407
Yes.

1083
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,162
Every one.

1084
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,882
So, you know them well?

1085
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:43,721
Very well.

1086
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,601
Would they be loyal to you?

1087
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,122
Of course.

1088
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:54,682
Show me.

1089
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:13,167
Fyodor Dubasov.

1090
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,202
<i>Mikhail Bakerin.</i>

1091
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:35,761
<i>Ivan Dashkov.</i>

1092
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,128
<i>Semyon Duchkin.</i>

1093
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,208
<i>Aleksey Mostokov.</i>

1094
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:45,164
<i>Mikhail Kazak.</i>

1095
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:49,289
<i>Ivan Sakov.</i>

1096
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,768
<i>Fyodor Tsvetkov.</i>

1097
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,564
<i>Viktor Bezhegov.</i>

1098
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,921
<i>Grigoriy Bakinskiy.</i>

1099
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,363
<i>This is Captain Andropov.</i>

1100
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,243
<i>I'm on board this American submarine,
USS Arkansas,</i>

1101
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,729
<i>of my own free will.</i>

1102
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,010
Hold your fire.

1103
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,611
The Arkansas, sir, she's alive.

1104
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,409
They've surfaced right next to Yevchenko.

1105
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,405
What the hell is that captain doing?

1106
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,128
Launch missile one on the submarine.

1107
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:27,483
Launch missile one on the submarine!

1108
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:42,642
Fire now!

1109
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,290
He's no longer your commander.

1110
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,602
Now, fire.

1111
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,927
Arkansas is broadcasting directly
to the Yevchenko.

1112
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:06,845
<i>This is your president.</i>

1113
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,851
<i>And I'm speaking to you
with complete authority.</i>

1114
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:15,124
<i>Any act of aggression
against the American ship</i>

1115
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:18,121
<i>will be an act of treason.</i>

1116
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,969
- He's alive.
- That's why he surfaced.

1117
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,929
Jayne, get this to
the other Russian generals.

1118
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,525
I need an audio file on this now.

1119
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:33,887
Minister Durov, my crew will not fire
on the American submarine.

1120
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,849
Very well, Captain. I will do it myself.

1121
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,888
Prepare KH35 surface-to-sea missiles.

1122
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:40,922
Yes, sir.

1123
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:55,370
We have a satellite detection
of KH35 launch vehicles on the move.

1124
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:56,761
Are they targeting our fleet?

1125
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,964
They're targeting Arkansas, sir.

1126
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,849
Tell Glass the Russians drew first.

1127
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,288
He is authorized to fire.

1128
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,849
Sir, if he fires into Russian territory,
it'll set off every sensor in Russia.

1129
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,684
You'll be triggering a nuclear response.

1130
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:20,842
If that sub goes down
with the president on board,

1131
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,922
we are in exactly the same place.

1132
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,606
Captain. Incoming message from Washington.

1133
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:27,201
Patching to the Conn.

1134
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,367
Commander Glass.

1135
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:32,330
Captain, this is Admiral Fisk.

1136
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,485
You are authorized to protect Arkansas
and your crew.

1137
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,804
Admiral, I need to know.
Are we already at war?

1138
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,521
Russian missile systems
in position to launch, Captain.

1139
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,482
Sir, if we take the first shot
above water,

1140
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,286
the whole world's gonna see us.

1141
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,806
Captain Glass, this is Charles Donnegan,

1142
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,124
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1143
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,010
You have a madman on your hands.

1144
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,889
<i>I've authorized you to fire!</i>

1145
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,563
We still have
the Tomahawk missiles, sir.

1146
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,681
Cob, battle stations.

1147
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,086
Man battle stations, aye.

1148
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,562
Launch procedures are underway, Minister.

1149
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:19,961
Thirty seconds.

1150
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,925
Spin up missiles one and two.

1151
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,480
Transfer target package three-Charlie-24.

1152
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,206
Aye, Captain.
Transfer 24-A...

1153
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,891
Flood Tomahawks one and two.

1154
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,240
Make solutions on warships now.

1155
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,684
Captain, the American sub
has opened its missile tubes.

1156
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,327
Tomahawks one and two ready for launch.

1157
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,002
Captain.

1158
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,883
You ever had to make a call
like this before, Captain?

1159
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:31,247
No.

1160
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,685
Captain, Durov will fire on you.

1161
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,442
No, sir,

1162
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,441
he'll be firing on you.

1163
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,723
Missiles are fueled and ready, sir.

1164
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,368
Fire!

1165
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:09,405
Missiles being fired from Polyarny.

1166
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:11,801
What the hell's he doing?

1167
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:14,330
Launch detection, 30 seconds.

1168
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,280
Launch detection.

1169
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,283
Washington reports
15 seconds to impact, sir.

1170
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:29,691
Locked on enemy missiles, sir.

1171
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,483
Captain, we're prepared to counter-launch.

1172
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,321
Remove safeties.

1173
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,246
All safeties off.

1174
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,006
- Five seconds, sir.
- We need to fire now, sir!

1175
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:48,922
Captain!

1176
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:50,642
Three seconds.

1177
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,963
- Intercept window closed!
- Impact!

1178
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,881
What just happened?

1179
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,324
Sir, we have a confirmed hit
on Russian soil.

1180
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,245
- Who fired?
- Not us.

1181
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:40,168
Polyarny Command Center
has been destroyed.

1182
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,211
<i>Missiles from the Yevchenko.</i>

1183
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,649
Hey, good job.

1184
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:51,161
- Good work.
- Captain.

1185
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:53,682
XO.

1186
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:56,971
That was close. Good work.

1187
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,202
Thank you.

1188
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,281
How did you know?

1189
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:22,842
I didn't.

1190
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:25,441
I hoped.

1191
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:31,925
Russian fleet is bearing off.

1192
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,004
They're backing up.
Jayne, what are you hearing?

1193
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:38,489
The Russian fleet is taking orders
directly from Zakarin aboard Arkansas.

1194
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,402
He's ordered the Air Force
to secure Polyarny.

1195
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,086
Careful on that step.

1196
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:22,690
Yeah, watch your feet,
Mr. President.

1197
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,411
Welcome aboard, sir.

1198
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:28,087
Captain.

1199
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:29,682
Captain.

1200
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,161
I have to go to work.

1201
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:37,562
Me, too.

1202
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:41,327
I can't think of any captain

1203
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:43,730
that could have done what you have done,

1204
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,325
on my side or yours.

1205
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,122
I can.

1206
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,166
I'm looking at him.

1207
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,082
Get him up.

1208
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:38,802
Be careful, he's injured.

1209
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:44,362
How's your man?

1210
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:46,684
He'll be okay. Couple of scratches.

1211
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,282
- Joe Glass.
- Bill Beaman.

1212
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,371
So, you're the lunatic
saved the Russian president.

1213
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,771
And you're the crazy son of a bitch

1214
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:56,649
who weaved this tin can
through a mine field.

1215
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,290
- Got a long debriefing.
- Yeah.

1216
01:50:59,040 --> 01:50:59,882
One hell of a story

1217
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,962
we'll never be able
to tell our grandchildren.

1218
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,087
I would like to take one last breath
before we go under.

1219
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,129
You never know what it's gonna
be like when you come up.

1220
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,600
Could've turned ugly.

1221
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,490
Instead, it's just a beautiful afternoon.

1222
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,561
What do you say we get out of here?

1223
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:25,045
Ever been on a hunter-killer, Beaman?

1224
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:28,166
That's the last place I want to be.
Claustrophobic.

1225
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:31,521
You'll be okay,
as long as you don't jump out this time.

1225
01:51:32,305 --> 01:52:32,911
