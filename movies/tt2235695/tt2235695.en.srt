[woman] <i>Last night,
I dreamt I went to Manderley again.</i>

3
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,916
<i>I dreamt that where our drive once lay,
a dark and tortured jungle grew.</i>

4
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:04,250
<i>Nature had come into her own
and yet the house still stood.</i>

5
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,083
<i>Manderley.</i>

6
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,333
<i>Secretive and silent
as it had always been.</i>

7
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,875
<i>Risen from the dead.</i>

8
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,458
[pistol cocking]

9
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>Like all dreamers, I was allowed
to pass through my memory.</i>

10
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,625
<i>Spanning the years like a bridge.</i>

11
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:29,625
<i>Back to that summer in Monte Carlo
when I knew nothing and had no prospects.</i>

12
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,125
Did you say eight?

13
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,625
- [driver] <i>Huit.</i>
- Yes.

14
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,125
- [driver] <i>Merci. Au revoir.
- Au revoir.</i>

15
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,541
[woman] <i>I can see
the girl I was so clearly,</i>

16
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,916
<i>even if I no longer recognize her.</i>

17
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,666
<i>And I wonder what my life
would have been without Mrs. Van Hopper.</i>

18
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,000
<i>Without that job.</i>

19
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,916
<i>Funny to think
that the course of my existence</i>

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,333
<i>hung like a thread upon her curiosity.</i>

21
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,666
<i>If it wasn't for her,
I would never have gone to Manderley...</i>

22
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,500
<i>and would never have met you.</i>

23
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,666
Mrs. Van Hopper.

24
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,083
[Mrs. Van Hopper] What kept you?

25
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,833
I'm sorry. I had to wait
for a package at the post office. I...

26
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,571
I believe it's from your nephew.

27
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,458
Oh, photographs of his honeymoon
with that ghastly girl, I imagine.

28
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,541
Open it.

29
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:44,625
- Get a table downstairs for lunch.
- Yes. One o'clock as usual?

30
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,208
- Now. I've just seen Maxim de Winter.
- Oh, right.

31
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,000
Still heartbroken, by the look of it.

32
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,666
He's a friend of yours?

33
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,000
Maxim de Winter, owner of Manderley.

34
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,125
- One of the finest homes in England.
- Oh, yes.

35
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,833
His wife died last year.
He's in dire need of company.

36
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,625
- Have the <i>maître d'</i> seat him next to me.
- Oh.

37
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,875
You'll have to tip.

38
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,833
Honestly, with everything
I'm teaching you,

39
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:17,956
you ought to be paying me.

40
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,875
- Thank you, Mrs. Van Hopper.
- Stupid girl.

41
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,416
[patrons speaking French]

42
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,416
<i>- Bonjour.
- Mademoiselle.</i>

43
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,875
Ah! Madam Van Hopper's usual table?

44
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,416
Oh, yes, thank you. <i>Merci.</i>

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,750
Oh, no. Um...

46
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,750
Wait, sorry. She was wondering
if a Mr. de Winter could sit with her.

47
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,875
<i>- Monsieur </i>Maxim de Winter?
<i>- Oui.</i>

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,416
It is the choice of Mr. de Winter
where he wishes to be seated.

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,958
Oh, yes, of course.

50
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,625
<i>Merci.</i>

51
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,375
[stammers] So sorry. Is that not enough?
Um, here. I've got more.

52
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,958
- Oh!
- [coins clink]

53
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,000
God, I'm so sorry, <i>monsieur.</i>

54
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,333
[sighs] Just one moment.

55
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,625
Don't do it.
I've heard he's a terrible bore.

56
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,958
- Excuse me?
- This de Winter chap.

57
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,041
Thank you.

58
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,416
[maître d'] <i>Monsieur </i>de Winter,
please, this way.

59
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,666
<i>Des huîtres, une douzaine.</i>

60
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,000
<i>"Des huîtres, une douzaine."</i>

61
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:34,041
Maxim de Winter. Well, I never.
I had no idea you were in Monte.

62
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,875
You must join us.

63
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:40,208
Edie Van Hopper.
I think you remember my nephew. Billy?

64
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,833
You met him at Blenheim last fall.
Billy Whitney. He's about my height.

65
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,375
He's got sandy hair
and he's got a bit of a lazy eye.

66
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,416
I can't imagine how I could've forgotten.
Do give my regards to Billy.

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,625
Oh, would you know?

68
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,041
He's married,
and to the most enchanting girl.

69
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,309
- Is he?
- He sent photographs.

70
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,958
I'll show you. Come here.
The wedding was divine.

71
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,125
I believe you,
but I prefer to lunch alone.

72
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,458
- Good day, Miss Van Hopper.
- Oh, no.

73
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:08,083
What? We're not related. She's staff.

74
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,125
Well, I mean,
I guess you could call her my ward.

75
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,333
Hmm, I see. Now, if you'll excuse me.

76
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,666
Darling, fetch those photographs.
Mr. de Winter would love to see them.

77
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,708
No, please. Don't trouble yourself.

78
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,166
- It's unnecessary.
- No trouble at all!

79
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,291
Not at all. Go along. Quickly.
No, no. She'll be down in a jiffy.

80
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,666
[women laughing]

81
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,458
[Mrs. Van Hopper]
This is my favorite part.

82
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,583
I asked her to get the photographs,

83
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:50,625
and she darts from the table,
and then she's gone. Doesn't come back.

84
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,250
I thought, "Oh, God, don't tell me
she started sketching."

85
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,625
- [all laughing]
- Oh, no, she's an artist.

86
00:05:56,375 --> 00:06:01,416
Anyway, she comes running back down,
reeking of cheap rose water.

87
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,166
<i>I mean, the smell of it!</i>

88
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,250
Show me an eligible bachelor

89
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:16,291
and I will show you a room full of women
acting like they've lost their minds.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's too late.

91
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,791
- Sorry.
- Never mind, sit down.

92
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,041
Related. I mean, imagine.

93
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:28,041
I loved the Manderley ball.
It was just so glamorous.

94
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,250
I suppose
that's all stopped since the tragedy.

95
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,000
Such a shocking thing that happened.

96
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,791
- How do you explain it?
- [woman 1] Awful.

97
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,791
- [woman 2] He adored her!
- [woman 3] Mmm.

98
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,000
His Rebecca.

99
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,416
[Mademoiselle] Morning, Mrs. Van Hopper.

100
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,875
[groaning]

101
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,541
- Mrs. Van Hopper?
- [groans]

102
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,708
Are you all right?

103
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,291
[Mrs. Van Hopper incoherently] I'm sick.
I'm sick.

104
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,958
I'm... I was sick all night.

105
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,875
- Call the... call the <i>medecin.</i>
- Okay.

106
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,416
- Call them right now. The doctor.
- All right.

107
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,083
Where is the bucket? Where's the bucket?

108
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,625
- I'll get the bucket! Here, I've got it.
- [vomits]

109
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,541
You are waiting for <i>madame?</i>

110
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,583
Oh, no. She's unwell.
The doctor told her to rest.

111
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,041
So, it's just me today.

112
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,500
It is not possible.
The terrace is for guests only.

113
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,083
But I'm a lady's companion... really?

114
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,875
Yes, it is not for staff.

115
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,291
<i>Monsieur?</i> The young lady will be
joining me. Set another place, please.

116
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,015
[maître d'] <i>Bien sûr, Monsieur</i> de Winter.

117
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,801
[in English] No, please.
I couldn't possibly.

118
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,250
It's absolutely fine.

119
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,958
- We needn't talk unless we feel like it.
- Oh.

120
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,208
You... you didn't have to do that.

121
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,458
My motives were entirely selfish.

122
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,375
This is yesterday's paper.
I've already read it.

123
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,416
Thank you. It's very kind.

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,166
- So, what is it you do for...
- I'm what's called "a lady's companion."

125
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,708
If a lady has to pay for company,
that says something about the lady.

126
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,235
[maître d'] May I take your order?

127
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,500
<i>Des huîtres, une douzaine.</i>

128
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,958
For breakfast?

129
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,375
You heard her. <i>Et encore du café.</i>

130
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,833
<i>Bien, Monsieur de Winter. Mademoiselle.</i>

131
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,291
If it's not rude, why her?

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,875
You would make an excellent
companion for any number of people.

133
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,333
I've always wanted to travel,
so there's that, and £90 a year.

134
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,875
I know that's not very much to you,
but it's a lot to me.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,208
I suppose you can
set a price on loneliness.

136
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,291
It's odd, isn't it?
Some people seem perfectly happy alone

137
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,833
while others just need someone
to pass the time with. Doesn't matter who.

138
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,916
Which are you?

139
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:00,833
Well, my parents are dead, so...
I'm used to being alone.

140
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:03,916
Ah.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
Here comes your breakfast.

142
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,541
<i>Et voilà. Une douzaine d'huîtres.</i>

143
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,706
- I've always wanted to try them, so...
- [chuckles]

144
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,708
Try them before they get warm.

145
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,583
- [jazz music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

146
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,375
[laughter]

147
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,416
Thank you so much.
I've never spoken so much in my life.

148
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,976
- It was very impressive.
- [chuckles]

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,458
- And I'm sorry about the oysters, too. I...
- No, that was fine.

150
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,541
Thank you very much. I...

151
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,458
I haven't enjoyed myself
like that for quite a long time.

152
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,625
<i>À bientôt.</i>

153
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,541
[Mrs. Van Hopper] Hello?

154
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,583
- [groaning]
- [knocking at door]

155
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,708
- A note from the front desk.
- <i>Merci.</i> Madame's indisposed.

156
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,831
- I'll take it to her.
- It's for you,<i> mademoiselle.</i>

157
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,541
<i>Merci.</i>

158
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,375
[Mrs. Van Hopper] What do they want?

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Um...

160
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,875
It was just the front desk, they were...

161
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,916
<i>wondering how you are.</i>

162
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,208
[Maxim] So how did you escape?

163
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,458
I said I had a tennis lesson.
She's been on at me to improve my game.

164
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,541
Sneaky.

165
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,791
- So where do you want to go?
- Anywhere is fine.

166
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,041
[Maxim] There must be
somewhere you want to see.

167
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,666
[Mademoiselle] Well, it's quite far.

168
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,291
[Maxim] Good. I could use the fresh air.

169
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,791
[Mademoiselle] Is this
a 3.5-liter Bentley?

170
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,125
[Maxim] It is.
How do you know so much about cars?

171
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,291
[Mademoiselle] Oh, my father,
he loved them.

172
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,458
[Maxim] If I may ask,
when did your parents pass away?

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,750
Two winters ago. Influenza.

174
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,958
Well, my mother
died of influenza, and my...

175
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,916
father died just four days later.

176
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,708
Do you think a person
could die of a broken heart?

177
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:46,208
- That was thoughtless of me. I'm sorry.
- No.

178
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,476
- [car honking]
- [Mademoiselle shrieks]

179
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,208
- [exhales]
- It's all right.

180
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,666
All part of the plan.

181
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,375
[chuckles]

182
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,541
EXOTIC GARDEN
PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING

183
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,000
[Mademoiselle] <i>There's a cactus,
it's native to Mexico,</i>

184
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,833
<i>and it grows to 65 feet tall.</i>

185
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,708
It lives for 200 years,
but it doesn't flower until it's 70.

186
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,125
[chuckles] Where do you learn this stuff?

187
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,833
I read about it.
Everything I know is from books.

188
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:27,291
I haven't really experienced anything yet.
I plan to before I'm old.

189
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,583
Look!

190
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,250
Have you been here before?

191
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,083
Years ago. On my honeymoon.

192
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,541
- How did your wife...
- Please... let's not.

193
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,541
[Mademoiselle] Mr. de Winter.

194
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,375
- Go on.
- Oh, no. I couldn't.

195
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,250
Yes. Yes, you can.
You know how, don't you?

196
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,875
Um, well, yes, I...

197
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,416
Well, good.
As long as you didn't learn from a book.

198
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,708
- [honks]
- [Mademoiselle chuckles]

199
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,666
Will you tell me about Manderley?
I hear it's beautiful.

200
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,666
It is. Yeah. Manderley,
it's more than a house. It's my life.

201
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,791
It's been passed from father to son
and father to son for centuries.

202
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,791
Until now, anyway.

203
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,250
You see, if I die without an heir,
it goes to my sister.

204
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:27,166
And her sons are nice boys,
but they're just not de Winters.

205
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,416
- [Maxim exhales]
- [Mademoiselle chuckles]

206
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,375
There we go.

207
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,083
Well, thank you
for getting us home safely.

208
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,750
Don't forget your things.

209
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,250
Sir, give us a hand?

210
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,041
This is what I need from you.

211
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,125
Would you grab that bag
and just lift at the same time?

212
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,333
One, two, three.

213
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,666
Put that back, please.

214
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,625
Yes, of course. I'm sorry. I...

215
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,625
Leave the keys with the valet. Good night.

216
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,583
[Mademoiselle] Good night.

217
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,291
[Mrs. Van Hopper weakly] Hello.

218
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,500
The nurse left an hour ago.

219
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,125
[stammers] The tennis coach only had
a late session free...

220
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,666
and I was practicing my serve.

221
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,291
A tennis lesson in the dark?

222
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,291
Yes.

223
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,708
[softly] Rebecca from Max.
Max from Rebecca.

224
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,708
You stupid girl.
Why would I look at his personal book?

225
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,208
[patrons chatting indistinctly]

226
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,500
For you. From <i>Monsieur</i> de Winter.

227
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,750
[Mademoiselle gasps] <i>Pour moi? Merci.</i>

228
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,875
- I'm off.
- [Mrs. Van Hopper] What have you got on?

229
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,541
I can see right through it.

230
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,500
Oh.

231
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,416
- You wearing any undergarments?
- Yes, of course.

232
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,125
I'm trying to paint beautiful houses.

233
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:07,583
Actually, you don't need
your tennis racket. All right.

234
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,250
[man] <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

235
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
<i>Merci.</i>

236
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,750
- [Mademoiselle] <i>What are you doing?</i>
- [Maxim] <i>Oh, you'll see.</i>

237
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,708
Imagine if you could
bottle a memory like scent.

238
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,833
Then, whenever you wanted,
you could open it.

239
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,458
It'd be like
living the moment all over again.

240
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,583
And what particular moments
in your young life would you bottle?

241
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,333
This week. Now. Every minute of it.

242
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,708
Never forget it.

243
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,041
And any memories you didn't want,
you could simply throw away.

244
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,958
[Mademoiselle] "Come for a drive."

245
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,250
"Lunch at the Cap."

246
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,125
The beach.

247
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,250
[Maxim] But I love the coast down here.

248
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,875
It's so beautiful.

249
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,916
Oh, there we go!

250
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,458
What are you looking at?

251
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,750
- Um, well, it's...
- Let me see.

252
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,625
I wouldn't if I were you.

253
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,958
No...
Well, it's just as well you're not...

254
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,875
- [gasps] Sorry.
- That's all right.

255
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,291
[Mademoiselle] Come on.
Let's go for a swim.

256
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,833
[chuckling] Come on. Come on!

257
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,125
- [shouts] Come in!
- No!

258
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,541
- [Mademoiselle] Why not?
- I don't want to!

259
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,185
[Mademoiselle] What are you afraid of?

260
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,458
It's too cold. No, it's freezing.

261
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,291
[Mademoiselle] No, it's not.
It's lovely!

262
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,958
[Maxim] I can feel it. It's freezing cold!

263
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,666
- You come here!
- No. I'm gonna drink all the champagne.

264
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,083
[Mademoiselle] I don't care!

265
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,416
[Maxim] God! Look
at what you're making me do.

266
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,416
[Mademoiselle laughs]

267
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,291
[soft piano music playing]

268
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,583
Oh, you're up.

269
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,708
I, um...

270
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,458
[stammering] I'm so glad
you're feeling better. Where's the nurse?

271
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,500
Dismissed.

272
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,125
Took a swim, I see. After tennis?

273
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,458
Yes.

274
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,625
Well, go on. Dry your hair. Chop-chop.

275
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,083
Are we going down for dinner?

276
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,666
I am.

277
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,250
You can see the concierge about
booking us on the early train tomorrow.

278
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,125
And you can set about packing.

279
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,291
Um, tomorrow?

280
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,875
Billy is sailing for New York on Saturday.
We can catch the same boat.

281
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sick to death of Europe.

282
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,541
[laughs]

283
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,583
Don't look at me like a drowned rat.

284
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,791
You'll get used to New York fast enough.

285
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,875
Plenty of boys and excitement.

286
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,333
All in your own class.

287
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,000
[sobbing]

288
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,791
[Mrs. Van Hopper] Did you
really think people wouldn't talk?

289
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,333
Oh, you're best out of it. Everyone knows
he nearly lost his mind after she died.

290
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,083
It was all too sudden and tragic.

291
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,291
[crying]

292
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,208
[Mrs. Van Hopper] Do you
honestly think he is in love with you?

293
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,166
<i>It was a distraction, dear. That's it.</i>

294
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,208
<i>We'll go away. We'll go to New York.</i>

295
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,458
<i>You'll find your way.</i>

296
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,000
You'll forget all about it.

297
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,291
Trust me, you will forget all about it.

298
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,625
[sniffling]

299
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,041
[knocking at door]

300
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,250
[Maxim] Just a moment.

301
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,041
[Mademoiselle breathing heavily]

302
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,875
Mrs. Van Hopper is leaving
and I have to go, too.

303
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,958
- [Maxim] What are you talking about?
- Now. Today.

304
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,166
I just wanted to say goodbye.

305
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,083
Why haven't you told me before?

306
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,083
Because she only decided it last night.

307
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:05,041
And we're going to Paris with...
to meet her nephew.

308
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,125
Then we go to Cherbourg
to sail to New York.

309
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:11,166
All right. Listen, you mustn't cry.
Just give me a moment to think.

310
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,250
I...

311
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,791
I can't stay long.
She's expecting me downstairs.

312
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,708
Come with me.

313
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:23,791
What?

314
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,416
To Manderley.

315
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,875
What? As your secretary?

316
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,833
No. No.

317
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,375
As my wife.

318
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,583
I'm asking you
to marry me, you little fool.

319
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,541
I can't come to Manderley.

320
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,791
Yes, you can.
You said you wanted to see the world.

321
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,958
Manderley is the best part of it.

322
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,916
Of course she's down there.
Where else is she?

323
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,750
I've got to leave
in 20 minutes to catch the train.

324
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,900
- I'll tell her.
- Do we have to go?

325
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,250
Yes, we do.
I'm actually looking forward to this.

326
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,958
That's exactly what I'm waiting for.

327
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,333
Now, don't worry.

328
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,833
- [knocking at door]
- [scoffs]

329
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,041
Who is this now?

330
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:22,208
[laughing] This is the most wonderful news
I've ever heard in my life!

331
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,142
Wait till I tell my friends,
I can't believe it!

332
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,291
What are the plans?
I must know everything.

333
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,291
The plans are settled.

334
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,291
We'll marry here,
and honeymoon in Europe.

335
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,375
And then home to Manderley.

336
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,875
Oh, my goodness. Have you ever heard
of anything more romantic?

337
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,208
- "Home to Manderley."
- Mmm.

338
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,411
[chuckling] Oh, my goodness.
It's out of a fairy tale.

339
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:43,875
All right. I'll go and make sure
your bags don't end up on the train.

340
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,375
- [Mrs. Van Hopper] Ah! Do hurry.
- You'll be fine.

341
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:50,166
[Mrs. Van Hopper chuckling] Yes, go along.
We have lots to talk about.

342
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:52,666
[door closes]

343
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,291
Well, goodness gracious,
don't you work quickly?

344
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,708
Have you been doing things you shouldn't?

345
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,875
- I don't know what you mean.
- [chuckles]

346
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,500
Well, you don't have a family,
luckily, to explain it to.

347
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,083
I wash my hands of it.

348
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,833
Gonna have your work cut out for you
at Manderley.

349
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,875
And, frankly,
I don't think you're up to it.

350
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,625
- I can learn.
- Let me tell you something, honey.

351
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:24,416
When you trap a man between your legs,
they don't stick around for long.

352
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,083
Goodbye, Mrs. Van Hopper.

353
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:33,250
He's only marrying you
because he doesn't want to go on living

354
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,416
in that big old house with her ghost!

355
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,833
I don't believe in ghosts.

356
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,458

[Maxim] Oh, God.
I hate it when they do this.

367
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,750
So much for keeping things quiet.

368
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,166
You know how she is, sir.

369
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,041
There's a way
things are done at Manderley.

370
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,615
[Maxim] Darling, this is Frith.

371
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:03,083
- [Mrs. de Winter] Hello.
- [Frith grunts]

372
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,000
[Maxim] Let's do things
properly, shall we? There we go.

373
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,708
- What are you doing?
- What? You don't like that?

374
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,625
- Up you go.
- [Mrs. de Winter shrieks]

[thunder rumbling]

377

[Mrs. de Winter] Max, put me down.

378
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,625
[kissing]

379
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:45,776
[Mrs. de Winter clears throat] Oh.

380
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,666
Mrs. Danvers.

381
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,208
Welcome to Manderley.

382
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,333
Hello. It's a pleasure. Oh!

383
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,458
- Thank you. Thank you.
- [Mrs. Danvers] Tea is ready.

384
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:12,000
[Maxim] Danvers runs the house. Don't
worry, she's not as scary as she seems.

385
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,375
[Mrs. de Winter]
Oh, Maxim, it's wonderful!

386
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,375
[barking]

387
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,541
Stop that.

388
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,583
There he is. The wanderer returns.
Good to see you, Max.

389
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,625
- And you, Frank.
- How was the trip?

390
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,791
Was rather eventful, as it turns out.

391
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,166
- Frank Crawley, Mrs. de Winter.
- It's a pleasure.

392
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,500
Thank you. Hello.

393
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,291
[Maxim] Frank's the estate manager.

394
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,935
The place would fall apart without him.

395
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,250
Ah, no, no. He exaggerates.
Ignore him. [chuckles softly]

396
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:45,500
I hate to be a bore,
but I urgently need a few signatures.

397
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,083
I'll have him back to you in a jiffy.

398
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,500
- Shall we?
- Yes.

399
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,916
Oh, uh...

400
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,625
Danvers, show Mrs. de Winter the house.
Can you?

401
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,375
Oh, that's all right. I'll wait.

402
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:02,708
No, don't be silly.
Go on. I'll catch you up.

403
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,166
[sighs]

404
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,958
[Mrs. Danvers] The estate has been
in the family for over 300 years.

405
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,875
It was originally a gift from Henry VIII.

406
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,541
[Mrs. de Winter] Extraordinary.

407
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,642
[Mrs. Danvers] If there are guests,
you may use the drawing room.

408
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,583
Don't forget to tell Frith
to light the fires,

409
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:35,375
but generally, Mr. de Winter prefers
to take his coffee here in the library.

410
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:41,041
Glad you're here, Mrs. Danvers.
I'll never remember all this.

411
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:49,500
Oh, I'm sure you won't disappoint him,
madam, if that's your concern.

412
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,916
<i>The de Winter family
dates back to the Tudors.</i>

413
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,666
[Mrs. de Winter] And, um, who's that?

414
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:59,791
[chuckles] That's Caroline de Winter.
Mr. de Winter's great aunt.

415
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,355
[Mrs. de Winter] She's very striking.

416
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:05,666
Yes, and one of the first women
to qualify as a doctor in England.

417
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,875
It's one of his favorites.

418
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,388
[Mrs. de Winter]
Where does everyone sleep?

419
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:16,041
Maids in the attic, men below stairs,
as in your other houses, I presume.

420
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,083
Never even seen a house like this.

421
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,083
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd been a lady's maid.

422
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,583
The master bedroom
is now in the east wing.

423
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,208
[clears throat]

424
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,291
What a... pretty pattern.

425
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:53,291
This is Clarice. She'll look after you
until your maid gets here.

426
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:57,333
I don't have a maid,
but I'm sure I'll manage without one.

427
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,708
Well, I think you'll find you need one.

428
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,500
Perhaps Clarice could take the position.

429
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:09,500
Oh! You can't see the sea from here.

430
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,958
No, you can't.

431
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,166
Should Mr. de Winter
ask for his old wardrobe,

432
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,500
I'm afraid you must tell him
it wouldn't fit here.

433
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,583
The rooms in this wing are much smaller.

434
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,416
This wasn't his bedroom before?

435
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,083
Oh, no. No. Mrs. de Winter's rooms
were in the west wing.

436
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:33,458
Well, it's a lovely room.
Much too nice to stand empty.

437
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,500
The guest rooms
are never empty for very long.

438
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,625
We entertained a lot
when the late Mrs. de Winter was alive.

439
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
The Manderley ball was quite an event.

440
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,208
I'll leave you with Clarice.

441
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,500
[Mrs. de Winter] <i>Ask me a question.</i>

442
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,041
[Maxim] <i>What sort of question?</i>

443
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,166
[Mrs. de Winter sighs] <i>Anything.</i>

444
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,041
<i>I have no secrets from you.</i>

445
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:14,708
<i>Don't you think that's how it should be
now that we're married?</i>

446
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,916
[Maxim] <i>All marriages have their secrets.</i>

447
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:26,333
You can talk to me about her...
if you want.

448
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,208
Good night, darling.

449
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,166
- [Mrs. de Winter grunts]
- [faint clattering]

450
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:25,666
[wind whistling]

451
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,458
[grunts]

452
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,541
[breathing rapidly]

453
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,750
[footsteps falling]

454
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,125
[Mrs. de Winter] Maxim?

455
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,958
- [Mrs. Danvers] Leave him.
- [yelps]

456
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,125
It's dangerous to wake a sleepwalker.

457
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,458
And nothing to worry about,
but the stables will need reroofing

458
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,500
because the tiles are spoiled...

459
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,791
[Maxim] Hmm.

460
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,833
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning.

461
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,708
- [Maxim] Sleep well?
- Yes, not bad.

462
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Come.

463
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,833
- How are you settling in?
- Very well, thank you.

464
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,041
Good. Good.

465
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:14,583
I'll... [clears throat]
see you up there, shall I?

466
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,583
- Won't be a sec.
- Mrs. de Winter.

467
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:17,666
Oh, Mr. Crawley.

468
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,000
Frank. It's Frank.

469
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,535
I should have got up earlier.

470
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,500
- We could have had breakfast together.
- Oh, that's all right.

471
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,500
Did you know you sleepwalk?

472
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,708
Enjoy your breakfast.

473
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,375
[servants giggling]

474
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,500
[dog barking]

475
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,041
- [Mrs. de Winter] Jasper!
- [barking]

476
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Where are you going? Jasper!

477
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,083
[whispers] Jasper, where have you gone?

478
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,416
- [shatters]
- [gasps]

479
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:20,375
[dog growls softly]

480
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,000
[exclaims] Ow!

481
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,333
[indistinct chatter]

482
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,125
I'm sorry to disturb you all...

483
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,916
Clarice, have you seen Mr. de Winter?

484
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,458
Do you have a plaster?
I've cut my hand.

485
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:06,583
[Clarice] Let me see.

486
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:09,500
- Really, it's nothing. I'm fine.
- Oh, my. One moment.

487
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:14,916
Since you're here, madam, may I have
your approval for today's menus?

488
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,083
[clears throat] Oh.

489
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,750
Yes. Good.
Very suitable. Very nice indeed.

490
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:23,916
- And the sauce for the roast veal?
- Yes, that looks excellent.

491
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,541
No, but I've left it blank, you see?

492
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,750
Mrs. de Winter was
most particular about her sauces.

493
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Right. Well, um...

494
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:35,958
Uh...

495
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,333
We'll have whatever Mrs. de Winter
would have had.

496
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,416
Very well, madam.

497
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,166
- There we go.
- Thank you very much.

498
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,416
[door opens]

499
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,541
[Maxim] Is everything all right, darling?

500
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:26,583
I was thinking of... ordering some
new undergarments from London.

501
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,916
Something lacy and a nightgown.

502
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:36,375
When have I ever complained
about what you wear?

503
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:48,041
[Mrs. de Winter] This is nice, isn't it?
Just us.

504
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,750
It's almost like
we're back on our honeymoon.

505
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:57,291
Oh, I miss it. Don't you?
Driving, the exploring, little cafes?

506
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,041
[sighs] Seeing some funny old hotel
and just staying there.

507
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,125
[Maxim] That's not real life, darling.

508
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:05,791
[barking]

509
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,083
- [shouts] Jasper! Jasper!
- I'll get him.

510
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,958
[Maxim] No, just leave him.
He'll find his own way back.

511
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:12,791
It's so steep. What if he falls?

512
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,166
I said leave him!

513
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:18,833
[Mrs. de Winter] Jasper!

514
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:21,583
Jasper!

515
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:24,875
Jasper, come here!

516
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,583
Jasper!

517
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:32,666
[barks]

518
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,750
Jasper!

519
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:46,333
Jasper, come out of there.

520
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,708
[door creaks]

521
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,125
[Jasper growling faintly]

522
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,166
Jasper, come here.

523
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,250
[growls]

524
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,291
All right, get something to tie you with.

525
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:33,625
[growls]

526
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,958
[barks]

527
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,041
Hello?

528
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,583
- There's nothing here, silly. Hey!
- [barks]

529
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:18,791
I'm...

530
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,708
I didn't realize that anyone lived here.

531
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:24,791
No, I don't, do I?
Live up in the keeper's cottage.

532
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,750
I've been digging
for shells since forenoon.

533
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,458
Oh, you've been digging for shells? Huh?

534
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,291
Um...

535
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,041
No. I just, I...

536
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,541
I needed something to tie my dog with.
I'll be out of your way.

537
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,541
- He ain't yourn.
- Oh, no.

538
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,166
- He's Mr. de Winter's dog.
- No.

539
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,875
That's her dog.

540
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,833
She don't come here no more.

541
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,458
She... she gone into the sea, ain't she?

542
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,416
She drowned.

543
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,250
You ain't like her.

544
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:07,875
Yes. Come on, Jasper.

545
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:11,208
I never said nothin', did I?

546
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,125
Come on, Jasper. Come on.

547
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,125
I know why you didn't want
to come down here.

548
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,041
How am I supposed to know?

549
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:36,166
How am I supposed to know anything
if you don't tell me?

550
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,791
- [Maxim] That's supposed to be locked.
- Someone was in there.

551
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:43,041
[Maxim] Probably just the keeper's son,
Ben. He's harmless enough.

552
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,291
[Mrs. de Winter] Maxim, I...

553
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,208
[thunder rumbling]

554
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,541
[indistinct laughter]

555
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,875
[Beatrice] Oh, God!

556
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:15,267
- [Mrs. de Winter] That's in Italy.
- [Beatrice] There he is.

557
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:17,875
[Mrs. de Winter] Oh, yes.
That was just after the wedding.

558
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,708
What a nice plain frock.

559
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:26,375
Look, Max was right.
You're not at all what I expected.

560
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,500
And you're looking better, old man.

561
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,708
Not so drawn.

562
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,458
- Please.
- Bosh!

563
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:35,750
Everyone knows you were
a perfect wreck six months ago.

564
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:39,541
Here, Granny, have you seen these?

565
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:41,666
- Look, aren't they lovely?
- [Granny] Ah.

566
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,458
[Beatrice] Goodness! Yes.

567
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,666
[Mrs. de Winter] So,
these were from our wedding.

568
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,958
[Beatrice] What's all this
I hear about you not hunting?

569
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,333
Oh, no, I'm afraid I don't ride.

570
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,625
Oh, but you must!
Or you'll miss out on all the fun.

571
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,166
Come and stay. I can teach you.

572
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,041
Finest horsewoman in the county.

573
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,708
Do dry up, Giles.

574
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:03,416
It might shock my sister
that not everyone shares her idea of fun.

575
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,125
Whatever her idea of fun,
she certainly deserves to have some.

576
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:11,375
Well, actually, I've been
thinking I might revive the ball.

577
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,500
- [Giles] Huh.
- Oh!

578
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,666
Hmm, what a marvelous idea.

579
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:21,291
That's not something we discussed.

580
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:24,333
[Beatrice] Oh,
don't be so damn miserable.

581
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,333
You used to love it.

582
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,458
You can hold it
in honor of your new bride.

583
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,541
Fine.

584
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,875
Well, that's settled, then.

585
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,708
- To our new hostess.
- Yeah. To our new hostess.

586
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,000
Are you staying at Manderley, dear?

587
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:46,456
[Beatrice] She lives here.

588
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,166
- [Giles] Remember, Granny?
- [Beatrice] Granny, we introduced you.

589
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,166
She's Maxim's wife.

590
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:54,666
[chuckling] No, she is not.

591
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:57,708
[chuckling]

592
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,333
[chuckling] She's not Maxim's wife.

593
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:10,041
[chuckling] What a silly notion.

594
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:15,250
Uh, well, it's...
good news about the ball, uh...

595
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,541
It's been far too long.

596
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,583
I don't remember you.

597
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,958
Oh, no, I...

598
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,916
[loudly] We haven't met before.

599
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:29,625
- Maxim, who is this child?
- Ow!

600
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,500
- [Giles] Oh, Christ.
- [Maxim] All right, let's get Granny home.

601
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,750
[Granny] What have
you done with Rebecca?

602
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,541
- [Beatrice] Leave it.
- No, I've got it!

603
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,465
[Granny] I want to see Rebecca.
Leave me alone!

604
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,166
[Giles] She just gets a little...
it's the time of day, and the weather...

605
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:47,053
- [Beatrice] Oh, my! Get her in the car.
- [Granny] I just want to...

606
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,666
[Giles] You go and talk to her.

607
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,750
Let's get in the car, Granny. Come on.

608
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,958
[Clarice] This is from the flower room.
I hope that's all right.

609
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,761
- [Mrs. de Winter] Thank you.
- I apologize.

610
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:59,166
I'd forgotten how fond
our grandmother was of Rebecca.

611
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,333
I'm fine.

612
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:03,708
She was just
one of those bloody annoying people.

613
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:09,666
Irresistible to everybody. The men, women,
children, animals. [chuckles]

614
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,583
Us mere mortals couldn't hope to compete.

615
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:23,375
[engine starts]

616
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:30,041
[thunder rumbling]

617
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,375
- [Frith] Sir.
- [Maxim] Why is he crying?

618
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:49,666
[Frith] Sir, one of the porcelain pieces
is missing from the morning room,

619
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,083
and now Danvers
is calling for the boy's dismissal.

620
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,446
- But it wasn't...
- Which piece?

621
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,541
We're not sure, sir.

622
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:56,416
Danvers!

623
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:00,000
- Is everything all right?
- [Maxim] Yes, it's fine.

624
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,708
Something's just gone missing
from the morning room.

625
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,833
- Danvers!
- What is it? What's gone missing?

626
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:10,541
What makes you think Robert took it?

627
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,583
The Dresden is extremely valuable, sir.

628
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:16,017
- But it wasn't me!
- [Mrs. Danvers] That piece is worth £100.

629
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:19,001
- [Frith] Sir, I find it most unlikely...
- [Mrs. Danvers] Then who, Frith?

630
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:23,000
The between maid isn't allowed
in the morning room. I do it.

631
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,750
When Mrs. de Winter
was alive, we did it together.

632
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:27,833
- [Maxim] All Frith is saying...
- It was me.

633
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:34,916
I broke it. It broke.

634
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,083
It was an accident. It fell.

635
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,958
Well, there we go.

636
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:46,208
Robert, you're off the hook.

637
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,416
[sniffles]

638
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:53,041
Where are the pieces, madam?

639
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,958
In the bureau drawer at the back.

640
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,916
Send them to London.
See if anything can be done.

641
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,200
[Mrs. Danvers] Certainly, sir.

642
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,625
And may I suggest,
should anything like this happen again,

643
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,500
that Mrs. de Winter tell me herself.

644
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:09,708
[Maxim] If we're all quite finished?

645
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
[sobs]

646
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:50,958
[exclaims angrily]

647
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:23,791
[dog barking]

648
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,708
[grunts]

649
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,375
[footsteps approaching]

650
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:07,375
Oh, Frank.

651
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,166
Mrs. de Winter.

652
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,625
I thought you'd
gone up to London with Max.

653
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:14,416
He's in London?

654
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,833
Yeah. Taking care of some paperwork.

655
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,458
He asked me to put a padlock on.
I nearly locked you in.

656
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:24,166
It's a shame.

657
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,500
This place going to ruin.

658
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:32,458
Well... no boat now.

659
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,583
Max doesn't like to sail.

660
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,416
Ben said she drowned.

661
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,166
I'm sorry. I assumed you knew.

662
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,333
- No.
- Ah, it's...

663
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:04,416
It was brutal weather.

664
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:08,125
Even for her. She was an excellent sailor.

665
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,083
The boat went down.

666
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:13,000
They never recovered it.

667
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:17,833
She washed up
in Edgcumbe some... two months later.

668
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:21,416
Two months? My God!

669
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:23,791
Poor Maxim.

670
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,916
Drove him down there myself
to identify the body.

671
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:33,375
You know, you really
mustn't dwell on the past.

672
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,958
You're so good for Max.
He's a changed man.

673
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,666
She must have been so afraid.

674
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,666
Out there alone.

675
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,666
She wasn't afraid of anything.

676
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:57,083
Can I ask you something, Frank?
And promise to tell me the truth.

677
00:53:57,166 --> 00:54:00,750
[chuckles] Hardly fair.
Don't know what you're gonna ask me.

678
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,166
Was Rebecca very beautiful?

679
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,375
Yes.

680
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,083
Yes, I suppose she was...

681
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:18,416
the most beautiful
creature I ever saw in my life.

682
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,666
[dramatic music playing]

683
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,375
- [perfume spritzes]
- [inhales]

684
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:16,205
- [Mrs. Danvers] It is beautiful, isn't it?
- [gasps]

685
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,833
I keep it just the way it was.

686
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,625
It's as if she'd just
gone out for a while.

687
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:26,041
You startled me.

688
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,541
This was her favorite.

689
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,458
I laid it out for her that night.

690
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:44,041
Go on, hold it.

691
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:46,625
Touch it.

692
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:56,583
She wouldn't have a lady's maid, you know.
"I don't want anyone but you, Danny."

693
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,666
Do you see how tall she was?

694
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:08,458
Hmm. She could wear
anything with a figure like hers.

695
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,875
I'd brush her hair for her every evening.

696
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,625
"Come on, Danny, hair drill," she'd say.

697
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,750
I'd stand behind her...

698
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:28,291
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

699
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,916
That great mass of dark hair.

700
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,750
He joined in.

701
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:42,541
He loved to do that for her.

702
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,583
They'd be dressing for dinner,
guests waiting downstairs.

703
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:50,500
"Harder, Max, harder!" [laughs]

704
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,833
And he'd roar with laughter.

705
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:56,791
He was always laughing back then.

706
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,250
Does he brush your hair?

707
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,791
No.

708
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:14,791
Mrs. Danvers, does Mr. de Winter
ask you to keep the room like this?

709
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:16,291
He doesn't have to.

710
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,750
She's still here.

711
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,833
Can you feel her?

712
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:26,833
I wonder what she's thinking about you.

713
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:31,416
Taking her husband and... using her name.

714
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:36,750
- I'm sure she'd want him to be happy.
- Happy?

715
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,541
No, he'll never be happy.

716
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,541
She was the love of his life.

717
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:05,916
- [footsteps falling]
- [muttering]

718
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,250
[gasping]

719
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,250
[Mrs. de Winter] Maxim?

720
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:19,708
- [vines rustling]
- [Mrs. de Winter yelps]

721
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:31,625
[grunts]

722
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,958
Good morning, madam.

723
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:38,333
- [breathing heavily]
- Oh, dear! You've been scratchin'.

724
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
[whimpers]

725
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,000
[exhales heavily]

726
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:04,041
[dogs barking]

727
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:17,750
[Favell] Have we missed ya?

728
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:25,541
Hello! You must be the new Mrs. de Winter.

729
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:27,916
Uh, I think there's been a mistake.

730
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,291
- Mr. de Winter's in London.
- He's left you on your own?

731
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:34,541
Isn't he afraid some bounder
might come and carry you off?

732
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:37,458
I'm Jack Favell. How do you do?

733
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,291
[laughs nervously]

734
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,208
Um...

735
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,250
Well, did you want to leave your card?

736
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,500
- And too polite to tell me to bugger off.
- [scoffs]

737
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:50,000
You are a sweetheart.

738
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,791
Not to worry.
I just popped by to see Danny.

739
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:54,625
She's invited me for tea.

740
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:58,583
- I'm horribly early, though.
- Mrs. Danvers?

741
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:01,416
That's why I thought
I'd better hover around out here,

742
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,791
otherwise I might
get a smack on the wrist.

743
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:07,166
[horse neighing]

744
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,416
Mr. Favell? Where are you going?

745
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,708
- [horse neighing]
- [Favell] Charlie, come on.

746
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:17,684
- Excuse me, Mr. Favell!
- [Charlie] Coming, sir.

747
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:18,708
[horse neighing]

748
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:20,958
Phillippa! Come on in, Charlie.

749
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:23,833
- [Charlie] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stand down.
- [neighing]

750
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,416
- [Favell] Easy, Starlight.
- Steady.

751
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,916
[Favell chuckling] You've too much energy.
They've been neglecting you.

752
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,041
That's not a surprise.

753
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,583
Rebecca was the only one
who could handle you, wasn't she, old boy?

754
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,666
Yes.

755
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,458
You knew Rebecca?

756
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,000
She's my cousin. Was.

757
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,583
[Charlie] That's it.

758
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,875
Let's take one of the horses
out for a turn.

759
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,791
Oh, no. I really... I don't know how.

760
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:53,833
Well, I can teach you.
Or have you something better to be doing?

761
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:56,666
- How do I...
- On three, swing your leg over.

762
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,184
- Ready?
- [Mrs. de Winter] Do you...

763
01:00:58,208 --> 01:00:59,541
[Favell] One, two, three.

764
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,208
[grunts]

765
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:04,375
- Can you give me a stirrup? All right.
- All right.

766
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:05,541
[gasps] Are you...

767
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:10,375
- We won't go too fast. [clicks tongue]
- [horse snorts]

768
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:16,791
[Favell] That's it.

769
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,875
How do you feel?

770
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,000
- Right, now you take the reins.
- Oh, all right.

771
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,166
- Be nice and loose.
- Yeah.

772
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,791
And low. That's it.

773
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:33,791
- Got it.
- Right here on your lap.

01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:37,625
Now, very important. Squeeze the thighs.

- Let the beast know you're there.
- Mmm-hmm.

776
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,500
You're gonna be
wickedly sore this evening.

777
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:46,125
- Now just move with me. Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

778
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,248
All right. [clicks tongue]

Has Max ever talked to you
about the accident?

782
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:01,541
And he never mentioned
Rebecca's trip to London that day?

783
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:03,833
No.

784
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:07,083
No, he won't speak of it at all.

785
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,666
So, you don't know if he saw her
when she got back that night,

786
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,583
before she took the boat out?

787

No.

788
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:21,708
[Favell] Hmm.

789
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,333
There's something she wanted to tell me.

790
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,791
Something very important.

791
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,750
And not knowing what it was...

That's really been a hard thing.

794
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:48,583
I'm not doing
my roguish image any good, am I?

795
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:53,458
You should come back and ask Maxim.

796
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:54,958
Well, I would.

797
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,250
But I'm afraid I'm a little bit banned
from visiting.

798
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,166
In fact, it's best if you don't mention
my being here at all today.

799
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,750
I... I thought you were friends.

800
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:09,750
Not really, no.

801
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:16,875
And I would hate for either one of us

802
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:20,708
to be on the receiving end
of that famous temper of his.

803
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:22,351
I don't know what you're talking about.

804

809
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:11,041
Jack Favell.

810
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,458
You asked him for tea,

811
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:17,625

has banned him from the property.

812

There must be some mistake, madam.

813
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:23,958
I haven't seen Mr. Favell for over a year.

814
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:56,625
[Maxim] Hello, Frith.

815
01:04:56,708 --> 01:05:00,166
[Frith whispers] Hello, sir. Mr. Favell
has made an unannounced visit.

816
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:07,001
[Mrs. de Winter] <i>I don't care
what she told Frith!</i>

817

[shakily] <i>Mr. Favell told me
that she invited him here.</i>

818
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:13,750
And I suppose Mrs. Danvers forced you
to go riding with him, did she?

819
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,166
No, I can explain!

820

- Explain what?
- I was going to tell you, I was.

821
01:05:18,083 --> 01:05:21,541
Want to tell me how you
dragged him down to the boathouse?

822
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:26,166
Parade your
fancy new night clothes for him?

823

[crying] How could you even think that?

824
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:33,250
I'd never have let him on the property
if I'd known it would upset you, Maxim.

Please. I love you.

Oh, do you?

Mrs. Danvers invited him here.

I've come to give you your notice.

834
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,875
Has Mr. de Winter agreed to this?

835
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,333
The decision is mine.

836
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:36,958
[Mrs. Danvers] You see...

837
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,500
I looked after Rebecca
when she was a little girl.

838
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,333
We came here together
when she was first married.

839
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:49,750
I was her friend.

840
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:54,083
Someone to share her secrets.

841
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,583
Bond like that can't be broke.

842
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:02,541
Can't be replaced.
I was wrong to expect that from you.

843
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:09,166
Well, you'll find another house.

No.

We women, we can either marry
or go into service,

847
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,958
and I'm too old for either.

848

Well, we'll make sure
that you're provided for.

849
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,375
Oh, it's not about money. It's...

850
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:32,916
This wasn't a job for me.
Rebecca was my life.

851
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:37,541
Yes.

852

I'm sorry if I failed you.

so set on doing things your own way.

hoped that you'd help me.

not picked out what to wear yet, and...

- So, what's your excuse?

Tree down across the drive.
Had to get it moved.

933
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:37,125
- No, no, for this.
- [laughing]

934

But I wear it every year, mate.

935
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,958
All right. Finally. Hey, here she comes.

[drum roll stops]

937

[laughs nervously]

939

Is this some kind of joke?

940
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:42,750
Of course not.
It's the painting. I thought...

941
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:43,875
[Maxim] Go and change.

942
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,791
What is it? What have I...

943
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,750
Go and change now.

944
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:54,125
I don't understand.

945
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:56,333
- What have I done wrong?
- I said now!

I'm sorry. Please, madam, I never knew.

949
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:15,750
It was Mrs. Danvers' idea.

950
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:27,250
Rebecca wore this before, didn't she?

951
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:33,291
[crying] Mrs. Danvers said he'd be
so pleased and you'd be so pleased.

952
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:41,625
Hold that.

953
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:47,041
- That's most unfortunate.
- It was uncanny, wasn't it?

[sighs]

955
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:58,291
- No, I can't.
- Oh, bosh! Darling, you have to.

956
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:00,166
No.

957

It's not as bad as all that.

958
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:08,333
You don't understand, I can't.
Not after this. Not after what I've done.

959
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:10,250
How were you to know?

960
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:14,333
Now, wash your face, and I'll find you
something to wear, all right?

961
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:16,666
[voice breaking] I should've known.

962
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:19,875
- I should never have worn it.
- Pull yourself together.

963
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:22,625
You can sit up here all night
feeling sorry for yourself,

964
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:26,750
or you can come downstairs with me
and have a good old laugh about it, hmm?

965

His face...

966
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,291
He wouldn't have spoken like that to her.

967
01:16:41,541 --> 01:16:45,541
You're very different people,
and that's nothing to be ashamed of.

968
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:49,125
- Okay.
- Come on.

You're not on the continent.
Let's have a stiff upper lip.

- Oh, yes.

This'll do.

972

I'll be all right.

Good show.

- Yes.

- Yes.

- [chuckles] Yes.
- Oh, never mind.

982
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:52,958
You look lovely,

983
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:56,083
and far more comfortable
than I am in this ridiculous getup.

984
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:58,291
Oh, don't be silly, darling.
You look divine.

985
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:02,458
- Maxim, I...
- This whole idea was a mistake.

01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:06,916
She was already dead.

1087
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,666
Her boat was damaged.

1088
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:12,000
I damaged it.

1089
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:14,916
Deliberately.

1090
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Oh, Maxim.

1091
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:22,291
You didn't know her.

1092
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:24,791
Nobody did.

1093
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:30,208
She told me on our honeymoon
how it would be.

1094
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,875
How she would keep her flat in London.

1095
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:36,958
Her parade of men. Even her own cousin.

1096
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:38,916
Please, Maxim!

1097
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:43,500
She relished it. Playing the part.

1098
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:48,125
The perfect wife,
knowing that I would never divorce her.

1099
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:49,791
'Cause you loved her.

1100
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:55,291
I hated her.

1101
01:27:58,041 --> 01:27:59,333
Hated her cruelty.

1102
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,750
I hated my cowardice.

1103
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:09,041
Knowing that I wouldn't divorce her.
Knowing I could never do that to our name.

1104
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:17,750
How did she die?

1105
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,833
When she came back from London,

1106
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:22,458
she told me
she was expecting a visit from Favell.

1107
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:25,416
When I got here, she was alone.

1108
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,208
She looked different. She was pale.

1109
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:30,416
She'd seen a doctor in London.

1110
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:36,041
She said, "Imagine if I had a child, Max.
You could never prove it wasn't yours."

1111
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:39,041
See, it wasn't enough
for her to take my pride.

1112
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:43,833
She wanted to take
my name, my home, everything.

1113
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:48,166
And she said, "Go on, Max, do it."

1114
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:52,041
"All you have to do is
pull the trigger and you'll be free."

1115
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:55,375
Please.

1116
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:07,250
[breathing heavily]

1117
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:20,791
Bullet went straight through her.

1118
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:24,208
She didn't fall right away.
She just stood there.

1119
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,208
So calm.

1120
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:28,916
Almost relieved.

1121
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,583
And then she was gone.

1122
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:39,750
All this time
I thought you still loved Rebecca.

1123
01:29:50,916 --> 01:29:51,916
[gasps softly]

1124
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:06,041
Why didn't you tell me?

1125
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:15,250
I couldn't.

1126
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:20,458
I was so afraid I'd have lost you.

1127
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:25,833
Go to the police, tell them everything.

1128
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:30,291
You didn't know. Nothing'll happen to you.

1129
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:36,583
I understand
if you want nothing more to do with me.

1130
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:39,166
That's your choice.

1131
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:48,000
You made a mistake...
identifying the body.

1132
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
It was the grief, the trauma.

1133
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:55,125
Nobody knows but us.
Nobody will ever know.

1134
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:59,083
No, she hasn't won, Maxim.

1135
01:30:59,916 --> 01:31:01,000
She hasn't won.

1136
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,000
We won't let her.

1137
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:26,583
You don't have to speak to them.

1138
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:29,333
[man] <i>All stand
for the Right Honorable James Crouch.</i>

1139
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:32,833
[reporters clamoring]

1140
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,500
[Frank] Stand back.

1141
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:37,125
[coroner] <i>Order! Settle down.</i>

1142
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,458
<i>This is the... Sit down, sir.</i>

1143
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:41,875
<i>This is the coroner's inquest</i>

1144
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:45,000
<i>into the discovery
of the body of Rebecca de Winter.</i>

1145
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:48,250
<i>This is not
currently a criminal proceeding.</i>

1146
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:51,416
We are here
only to ascertain how Mrs. de Winter died.

1147
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:55,833
The court will now hear from
Detective Welch of the Kerrith police.

1148
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:57,625
Detective Welch.

1149
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:02,958
The body
Mr. de Winter identified last year...

1150
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,083
was not his wife.

1151
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,958
In fact, Rebecca de Winter's body
was recovered from the cabin of her boat.

1152
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:13,000
That troubled me.

1153
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:15,458
As did the nature
of the damage to the vessel.

1154
01:32:15,541 --> 01:32:17,291
And what was that nature?

1155
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:19,666
We found four holes below the waterline

1156
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:22,291
consistent with those
made by a ship's gaff.

1157
01:32:23,458 --> 01:32:25,333
- Or spike.
- Suggesting what?

1158
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:27,125
That the boat was deliberately scuttled.

1159
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,708
[indistinct murmuring]

1160
01:32:28,791 --> 01:32:31,166
In my opinion, Mr. Coroner,

1161
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:34,041
this inquest can return
one of only two verdicts.

1162
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:38,541
Suicide or unlawful killing.

1163
01:32:44,916 --> 01:32:47,291
[coroner] <i>Your wife made a trip
to London the day she died.</i>

1164
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,250
It's time.

1165
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:52,833
In your statement to the police,
you say your wife seemed

1166
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:55,958
"preoccupied and unhappy"
when she returned.

1167
01:32:56,666 --> 01:32:58,833
Don't be defensive.
Answer their questions calmly.

1168
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,250
[coroner] What was the purpose
of her trip?

1169
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,041
No idea.

1170
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:05,750
[coroner] Was it normal for your wife

1171
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:08,291
not to discuss such matters
with her husband?

1172
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:10,666
Are you implying
there were problems in my marriage?

1173
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:14,000
I'm trying to understand
how you apparently failed

1174
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:16,208
to recognize your own wife last year.

1175
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:19,125
She'd been two months at sea.
She drifted 20 miles.

1176
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,583
She was bloated, decomposing,

1177
01:33:20,666 --> 01:33:23,333
her arms ripped off, `
and there was nothing left of her face.

1178
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:24,416
[audience clamoring]

1179
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:27,291
- [coroner] Order! Order!
- [banging gavel]

1180
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:34,208
[Maxim] <i>I was arrogant and stupid.</i>

1181
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:38,375
- I lost my nerve.
- [Mrs. de Winter] No, you were passionate.

1182
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,166
They'll believe it.

1183
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:43,583
Who else knows she saw a doctor in London?

1184
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:48,333
You, me, and the doctor.

1185
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:51,875
They're not likely
to find any physical evidence.

1186
01:33:53,041 --> 01:33:54,541
Not after so long at sea.

1187
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,666
The doctor is all they have.

1188
01:34:05,041 --> 01:34:08,333
I did tell Mr. Favell
he wasn't welcome, but he insisted.

1189
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:10,625
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

1190
01:34:12,916 --> 01:34:14,625
What the hell do you want?

1191
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:20,166
Another whiskey and soda would be nice.

1192
01:34:21,833 --> 01:34:23,041
It's about Rebecca,

1193
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:25,166
so you might want
to send your wife off to bed.

1194
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:28,083
I'm not going anywhere.
I know all about you and Rebecca.

1195
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:29,791
Oh, really?

1196
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:32,708
You know all about that, do you?

1197
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,833
You were close, Favell.

1198
01:34:35,916 --> 01:34:37,833
If I'd caught you here
that night with her...

1199
01:34:37,916 --> 01:34:39,208
He was never here that night.

1200
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:40,625
But she did invite me.

1201
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,500
And that's the point.

1202
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:48,500
Suicide or foul play,
that's what the chap said, wasn't it?

1203
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:52,666
Now, inviting someone over...

1204
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:55,666
doesn't really sound like
the sort of thing one would do

1205
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:58,375
if one was planning to end it all,
does it?

1206
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:03,208
And that's what's been
driving me mad this last year.

1207
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:06,708
But it's beginning to make sense.

1208
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:12,250
She finally decided to leave you.
Is that why you killed her?

1209
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:17,416
You've no proof.
It's your word against mine.

1210
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,500
No.

1211
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:23,208
It's your word against Rebecca's.

1212
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:27,833
"Come to Manders when you get this.

1213
01:35:27,916 --> 01:35:29,750
I've something to tell you

1214
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:33,791
and I want to see you
as soon as possible. Rebecca."

1215
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,208
[Mrs. de Winter] Let me see.

1216
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:39,476
- [Maxim] Get out of my house.
- Don't rise to it, Maxim.

1217
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,541
[chuckling] Yes. Don't rise to it, Max.

1218
01:35:43,291 --> 01:35:45,416
I only came by to thank you, really.

1219
01:35:46,291 --> 01:35:49,125
You've been so generous over the years,

1220
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:51,916
sharing your wife
with so many of us chaps.

1221
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:56,416
Actually, I wondered
if I might try my luck with the new one.

1222
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:01,541
[Favell] There's that temper
I told you about.

1223
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:03,958
How much do you want?

1224
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:08,750
She's cleverer than she looks, this one,
isn't she?

1225
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:12,208
Seems to be a spot of blood.

1226
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,250
Oh, dearie me.

1227
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:18,750
[groans]

1228
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:22,333
She's right, though.

1229
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:25,333
I'm not a rich man, Max.

1230
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:28,916
Well, I'm too fond of gambling for that,

1231
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,125
but I do have a certain lifestyle
that I've come to enjoy.

1232
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:37,958
I imagine I could get by on around...

1233
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:42,250
£10,000 for the note

1234
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:45,416
and my silence
when I take the stand tomorrow.

1235
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,125
This is blackmail.

1236
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:49,583
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

1237
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:52,041
[Favell chuckles] Yeah. Call the police.

1238
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:56,000
Might even put us in the same cell.

1239
01:36:57,583 --> 01:36:58,666
Not for long, though.

1240
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:02,000
I imagine you're looking
at the noose, Maxim.

1241
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:11,458
[coroner] At Inspector Welch's request,

1242
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:14,125
there's a change
to this morning's proceedings.

1243
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:15,791
We shall now hear

1244
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:19,125
from the de Winters' housekeeper,
Mrs. Danvers.

1245
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,958
[Welch] Safe to say
not much occurs at Manderley

1246
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:31,625
without your knowledge
or say-so, would I be right?

1247
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:34,791
I ensure the smooth running of the house.

1248
01:37:35,375 --> 01:37:37,083
[Welch] Which is how
you came to be aware

1249
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:40,166
of the late Mrs. de Winter's
relationship with Mr. Favell.

1250
01:37:41,041 --> 01:37:43,375
[Mrs. Danvers] Well, I was
aware they were, um, intimate.

1251
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:45,541
But my lady's
private affairs were her own.

1252
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:46,916
[Welch] So they should be.

1253
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,166
But since
these circumstances are far from normal,

1254
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:52,666
perhaps you'd share with the court
what you told me last night.

1255
01:37:53,791 --> 01:37:56,375
I learned of a note
addressed to Mr. Favell.

1256
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:59,875
I urged him to share that note with you.

1257
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:04,000
A note Mr. de Winter
seemed keen to keep from this court.

1258
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:05,083
[Mrs. Danvers] Yes.

1259
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:10,750
The note was inviting Mr. Favell
to join Mrs. de Winter at the house...

1260
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,666
the night my lady died.

1261
01:38:14,333 --> 01:38:19,500
Mr. de Winter offered money
in exchange for that note.

1262
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,666
[Welch] The note
was from Rebecca de Winter.

1263
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:22,750
[Mrs. Danvers] It was.

1264
01:38:23,416 --> 01:38:26,208
She wrote
she had urgent news to share with him.

1265
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:32,250
And how much was Mr. Favell offered?

1266
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:34,458
£10,000.

1267
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:36,333
[audience murmuring]

1268
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,250
[Welch] A check...

1269
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:47,458
written by Mr. de Winter...
in exchange for the note.

1270
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:49,458
Where does it say that?
All you have is a check.

1271
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:52,061
- Nothing to say what it's for.
- [coroner] Order! Madam, order.

1272
01:38:53,083 --> 01:38:58,291
Mrs. Danvers, do you think it's likely
Rebecca de Winter drowned herself?

1273
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:00,791
[Mrs. Danvers] No, sir. I do not.

1274
01:39:00,875 --> 01:39:04,166
In the weeks, uh, leading up to her death,

1275
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:09,666
she had become
fatigued and was feeling sick.

1276
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:14,541
And she asked me
to let out the waistband in her trousers.

1277
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:17,291
Her belly was growing.

1278
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:24,750
Mrs. de Winter went to London
the day she died. Did she say why?

1279
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:26,416
- [Mrs. Danvers] No.
- Odd.

1280
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:29,708
It must've been something deeply personal
for her to have kept that from me.

1281
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:32,291
Like, say, an appointment with her doctor.

1282
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:35,333
Not her family doctor,
as you might expect, but someone discreet.

1283
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,500
Away from prying eyes

1284
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:42,000
as if news of her condition
was something she wished to keep private.

1285
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:47,333
A wish to share
only with her lover, Jack Favell.

1286
01:39:48,166 --> 01:39:52,000
You murdering bastard.
[loudly] You're a murdering bastard!

1287
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:54,583
With my child! I hope they hang you.

1288
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:57,250
I hope they hang you!
You murdered Rebecca!

1289
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:58,833
Only two possible verdicts.

1290
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:02,708
I hope you agree, sir,
that there's no motive at all for suicide.

1291
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:05,583
But a clear one for murder.

1292
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:09,625
[coroner] This inquest is suspended
pending a criminal investigation.

1293
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:12,166
Ladies and gentlemen, court is adjourned.

1294
01:40:13,416 --> 01:40:14,916
Nobody's above the law.

1295
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:18,458
[Maxim] Get your hands off me! Get off!

1296
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:19,833
[Welch] Mrs. Danvers.

1297
01:40:20,416 --> 01:40:22,125
Say nothing. They can't prove anything.

1298
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:24,291
I want her appointment books,
diaries, address books,

1299
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:25,916
household finances, everything.

1300
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,041
She saw that doctor sometime
and she paid him.

1301
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:32,875
Roe, start placing calls
to women specialists in London.

1302
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:34,333
[crowd clamoring]

1303
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:05,541
[Mrs. Danvers] No. No.

1304
01:41:12,416 --> 01:41:15,541
[Frank] I'm sorry, do you have
permission to search this place?

1305
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:27,208
[tires screech]

1306
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:36,250
Mrs. de Winter?

1307
01:41:36,333 --> 01:41:37,708
- Oh, Frank!
- What?

1308
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,791
I need her checks, her bank statements.

1309
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:42,208
Anything that has
the name and address of her doctor.

1310
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:45,000
Right. Here it is. I know what you need.

1311
01:41:47,375 --> 01:41:49,583
- I need a doctor.
- You need her doctor? There.

1312
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,500
[Mrs. de Winter] That must be it.

1313
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,620
[Mrs. Danvers] Shame on you.

1314
01:41:57,125 --> 01:41:59,625
Shame on you for taking his side.

1315
01:41:59,708 --> 01:42:02,250
I'm not taking anyone's side,
Mrs. Danvers. I...

1316
01:42:02,333 --> 01:42:06,916
And you, Frank.
Licking Mr. de Winter's boots by day,

1317
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,708
and pawing at the cottage door at night.

1318
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,958
Sobbing like a schoolboy.

1319
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:15,125
She despised you all.

1320
01:42:16,208 --> 01:42:19,041
The men in London,
the men at the Manderley parties.

1321
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:22,250
You were nothing but playthings for her.

1322
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:26,833
And why shouldn't a woman amuse herself?

1323
01:42:30,458 --> 01:42:34,708
She lived her life
as she pleased, my Rebecca.

1324
01:42:38,291 --> 01:42:40,458
No wonder a man had to kill her.

1325
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,400
[Mrs. de Winter] It must have hurt.

1326
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:49,583
Knowing your only friend in the world
took a secret like that to her grave.

1327
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:54,833
Pack your bags, Mrs. Danvers.

1328
01:42:55,875 --> 01:42:57,708
I expect you gone by nightfall.

1329
01:43:59,791 --> 01:44:01,250
[honking]

1330
01:44:09,166 --> 01:44:10,416
[gasps]

1331
01:44:20,041 --> 01:44:22,041
[bell tolling]

1332
01:44:44,875 --> 01:44:47,916
- Miss?
- Terribly sorry, I've left my purse.

1333
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,750
[butler] Who was it you saw, Miss?

1334
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:51,666
[Mrs. de Winter] Dr. John Baker.

1335
01:44:58,166 --> 01:44:59,333
Thank you.

1336
01:45:02,791 --> 01:45:04,166
[knocking at door]

1337
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:06,875
[butler] Wait there.

1338
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:18,861
- [butler] Dr. Baker, sir.
- [Dr. Baker] Good evening, Tas.

1339
01:45:23,541 --> 01:45:24,625
"Danvers."

1340
01:45:26,125 --> 01:45:27,125
[door opens]

1341
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:39,166
[Dr. Baker] I see so many patients.

1342
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:43,750
I can't remember her.

1343
01:45:43,833 --> 01:45:46,666
[Welch] Maybe it'll
come back when you see her file.

1344
01:45:51,208 --> 01:45:54,375
[Dr. Baker] It would have been more
convenient to read the file to begin with.

1345
01:45:57,416 --> 01:45:59,458
We'll do what we can to help.

1346
01:45:59,541 --> 01:46:02,208
Oh, no. This is not as it should be.

1347
01:46:04,166 --> 01:46:05,416
Where's she gone now?

1348
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
[Dr. Baker] Who?

1349
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:10,125
[butler] The young woman who was here.

1350
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:14,666
It's not here.

1351
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:17,041
I'll have a word with my secretary.

1352
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:22,875
[Dr. Baker] It's possible
she misplaced it.

1353
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:27,708
This girl. Is there any way
she could get out of here?

1354
01:46:34,416 --> 01:46:35,416
[door opens]

1355
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,875
- [door creaking]
- [Mrs. de Winter inhales sharply]

1356
01:46:58,458 --> 01:47:01,416
I read it, that's all.
I haven't changed a word Dr. Baker wrote.

1357
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:05,416
Rebecca Danvers.
Yes, now I remember. Terrible thing.

1358
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:08,333
That wasn't her real name.
And she wasn't pregnant.

1359
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,208
Then why would she use a false name?

1360
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:12,666
Why would she come all the way to London

1361
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,083
to make an appointment with you
and not her family doctor?

1362
01:47:15,166 --> 01:47:18,208
Perhaps she wanted
to spare her family the news.

1363
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:19,958
That the baby wasn't her husband's?

1364
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:24,041
Inspector, I am not
that kind of women's specialist.

1365
01:47:24,125 --> 01:47:28,375
I'm not an obstetrician.
My field is oncology.

1366
01:47:28,458 --> 01:47:31,833
I treat cancers
of the reproductive system.

1367
01:47:31,916 --> 01:47:34,416
The bloating, the fatigue.
They're common symptoms.

1368
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:37,333
She had cancer.

1369
01:47:39,666 --> 01:47:41,333
There's her news for Jack Favell.

1370
01:47:41,416 --> 01:47:43,791
That doesn't prove she killed herself.

1371
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:46,166
She wouldn't have wanted to suffer.

1372
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:48,375
Yes, she told me as much.

1373
01:47:49,125 --> 01:47:51,750
She was very advanced
by the time she was symptomatic.

1374
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:53,250
Saw her first in April,

1375
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:56,583
by May, it was clear
she was too far gone for treatment.

1376
01:47:56,666 --> 01:48:00,500
She only had weeks
and the pain would have been considerable.

1377
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:03,000
How did she do it?

1378
01:48:05,583 --> 01:48:07,916
She took out her boat and scuttled it.

1379
01:48:09,291 --> 01:48:10,625
She drowned herself.

1380
01:48:15,791 --> 01:48:16,875
[latch drawing]

1381
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,875
[keys jingling]

1382
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:20,041
[lock turning]

1383
01:48:53,458 --> 01:48:55,125
Stroke of luck for you there, Max.

1384
01:49:04,791 --> 01:49:06,375
I bet you think you've won, don't you?

1385
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:11,125
Well, maybe the law can't get you.
I still can.

1386
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:14,916
Is there anything else you want to say?

1387
01:49:16,083 --> 01:49:17,483
If there is, you better say it now.

1388
01:49:31,666 --> 01:49:33,875
Do you know what I hate her for most?

1389
01:49:35,458 --> 01:49:37,291
It's what she's taken from you.

1390
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:42,750
It's gone forever. That funny, young,
lost look I loved so much.

1391
01:49:44,458 --> 01:49:46,291
You're not that person anymore.

1392
01:49:46,916 --> 01:49:48,458
Don't hate her for that.

1393
01:50:32,916 --> 01:50:35,958
What's that burning?
Oh, my God, that's Manderley.

[staff clamoring]

1395
01:50:44,541 --> 01:50:46,125
[Frith] Come on! Get away from there.

1396
01:50:46,208 --> 01:50:49,041
Get off the lawn! Go! Come on!

1397
01:50:50,791 --> 01:50:52,751
[Maxim] Get off the lawn!
Frith, get off the lawn!

1398
01:50:52,833 --> 01:50:54,625
How many people are inside?
Is everyone out?

1399
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:58,083
- [Frith] I don't know, sir.
- You all right? What happened, Clarice?

1400
01:50:58,166 --> 01:50:59,250
I saw her.

1401
01:50:59,333 --> 01:51:01,333
[Mrs. de Winter] What do you mean?
Who did you see?

1402
01:51:01,375 --> 01:51:02,791
[Clarice] Mrs. Danvers.

1403
01:51:02,875 --> 01:51:06,000
[Maxim] Help her! Where are the hoses?

1404
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:10,291
- Where is she?
- She went to the boat house.

1409
01:52:18,958 --> 01:52:21,125
[Mrs. de Winter] Mrs. Danvers! Please!

1410
01:52:22,583 --> 01:52:23,750
Please come away.

1411
01:52:25,041 --> 01:52:27,041
You asked for my help. Here it is.

1412
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:29,500
Mrs. Danvers, please.

1413
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,833
He killed the only person I loved.

1414
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:36,000
I can't let you have Manderley.

1415
01:52:37,333 --> 01:52:38,875
It was ours, you see.

1416
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,208
You don't have to do this.

1417
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:46,750
I know you'll stand by him.
But you'll never know happiness.

1418
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:51,291
Yes, I will.

[Mrs. de Winter] <i>Last night,
I dreamt I went to Manderley again.</i>

1423
01:53:58,458 --> 01:54:01,208
<i>I dreamt of Mrs. Danvers and of Rebecca.</i>

1424
01:54:05,833 --> 01:54:10,416
<i>But this morning I woke up
and left the dead behind.</i>

1425
01:54:12,833 --> 01:54:16,958
<i>And as I sit before the mirror
in our stuffy little room in Cairo,</i>

1426
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:22,000
<i>just another stop
on our quest to find a real home,</i>

1427
01:54:24,166 --> 01:54:26,083
<i>I can see the woman I am now.</i>

1428
01:54:28,416 --> 01:54:31,250
<i>And I know
that I have made the right decision...</i>

1429
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:37,625
<i>to save the one thing
worth walking through flames for.</i>

1430
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:41,708
<i>Love.</i>
