Love, with aII its pIeasure,

6
00:01:53,279 --> 00:02:00,160
becomes even more blissful
through the way it is expressed.

THE TIDE

8
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,884
Based on a story by
André Pieyre de Mandiargues

9
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,680
"My cousin JuIie was 1 6, I was 20.

10
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:25,894
"This smaII age difference
made her susceptibIe to my authority."

11
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:29,564
- Take care of yourseIves.
- Now don't worry, mother.

12
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,733
- Be carefuI too.
- Yes, yes.

13
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,492
FareweII, tiII tomorrow! Don't worry.

14
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,714
JuIie!

15
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,105
How many tomatoes do you want?

16
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,899
Two. But hurry now!

17
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,905
JuIie!

18
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,871
- My hat!
- Where is it?

19
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,249
In my bedroom under the bed!

20
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,723
Take off that hat.

21
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,101
- You're wearing one.
- This isn't a hat.

22
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:12,143
Now you've flown away,
naughty nightingale

23
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:16,731
That was my turn to play

24
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:21,194
Be back in my dreams,
happy nightingale

25
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,532
Take a rest all day
That night is my turn to play

26
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,779
I'm running ahead...
so as not see you.

27
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:11,327
I'II forget you, so it'II be more exciting
when we meet at the beach.

28
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:09,135
- How many?
- Five. ReaIIy.

29
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,304
Since Iast summer, I have met five boys.

30
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,182
- What do you mean you "met" them?
- We'd meet.

31
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,726
- Where?
- At parties.

32
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,314
We kissed.

33
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,026
- And that's aII?
- Yes.

34
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:33,910
- On the Iips?
- No, Mum was aIways nearby.

35
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,801
Untouched.

36
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:58,268
Thanks to my aunt.

37
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,769
But today, she is far away.

38
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,564
Poor thing, with that wig of hers.

39
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,857
- What?
- Never mind.

40
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,569
I'm saying your mother
Iooks Iike Madame CIaude.

41
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,863
That fat Iady
that gets you girIs in Paris?

42
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,616
- Me, and my friends.
- Prostitutes.

43
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:16,035
- Whores.
- Do you see them often?

44
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:20,456
Every Wednesday.
We don't just watch them, we have fun.

45
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,835
- Do you kiss?
- Not quite.

46
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,795
But we do use their Iips.

47
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:37,056
Watch it, brat!

48
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:45,189
If we go any further,
water might reach us.

49
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,028
We'II hardIy make it back
to CouviIIe beach before high tide.

50
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,863
It's your fauIt.

51
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,199
You shouId've been ready sooner.

52
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,036
But it's too Iate now.

53
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,831
There is no way we can be back.
We've gone too far.

54
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:11,007
We'II reach that bouIder
in front of us...

55
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,594
and we'II stay there
untiI tide has gone down.

56
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,684
My feet hurt!

57
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:21,953
What's going to happen?

58
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:26,999
There's no one around.
The tide is coming in...

59
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,419
It'II run into the pook,
but not much more.

60
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,754
The dry seaweed on the rocks
you can see out there...

61
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,926
If we just sit higher up,
onIy our feet wiII be wet.

62
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,572
Hey, JuIie!

63
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,950
André, I'm over here!

64
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,044
Come over to me!

65
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,022
On aII fours!

66
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:29,372
Stand up.

67
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,763
Now, put your dress back on...

68
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,580
It's aIready dirty.

69
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:16,294
Never mind. You can rinse it out
when we get back to the house.

70
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,512
HIGH AND LOW TIDE HOURS

71
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:50,620
Now take off this wet bathing suit
so that you're nude under the dress.

72
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,834
PIaying hide and seek
in the seaweed is a siIIy game.

73
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,217
You're going
to pIay another game with me.

74
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:12,475
I don't mind.

75
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,047
Come here!

76
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,430
Come!

77
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,030
Come cIoser...

78
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:10,992
Some more...

79
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,578
Come as cIose as you can.

80
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,581
Look. You see...

81
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,919
EIeven twenty-seven.

82
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,757
For a Iong time, I've wanted your Iips

83
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:30,636
Iike a man in the desert needs water.

84
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:34,807
Now, nothing can stop me.
I'm going to fuIfiI my desire

85
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,560
and appease my thirst.

86
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,104
You reaIIy want me
to kiss you on the mouth?

87
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,941
I'm not going to kiss you on the mouth,
as you so guiItiIy put it.

88
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:47,820
But you're going to take me in your mouth
just Iike I toId you.

89
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:51,741
You seemed to understand.

90
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,702
Like the whores at Mrs CIaude's.

91
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,164
I'II stay in you as Iong
as it takes the tide to rise,

92
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,791
more than haIf an hour.

93
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:05,379
During that time,
to keep your mouth on me,

94
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:08,591
I'II expIain to you
the mechanism of the tides.

95
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:13,679
You'II pay attention
to what I'II be doing in your mouth,

96
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:19,518
to what I'II say about the sea
that rises Iike my desire.

97
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:23,105
At 1 1 :27, preciseIy,

98
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,442
I wiII come in your mouth.

99
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:32,531
You shouId know that such
seIf-controI is not easy,

100
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:38,245
but I've mastered it,
despite being not much oIder than you.

101
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:41,999
MeanwhiIe, I wiII need to meditate...

102
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,711
and you, too, shouId meditate.

103
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,633
You shouId think carefuIIy
about whatever you Iike...

104
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,805
yourseIf, or me...
about someone or something you want.

105
00:16:55,931 --> 00:17:02,478
Above aII, you'II feeI the progression
of my desire as it reaches fuIfiIment.

106
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,816
When at Iast, I come in your throat,

107
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:11,445
you wiII swaIIow my Iiving fluid
gentIy and obedientIy.

108
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,864
This vitaI gift is very important

109
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,616
and you wiII think of this gift

110
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:20,788
as being the resuIt
of the great tidaI movement around us.

111
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:26,877
But you shouIdn't expect me to teII you
about what I thought aII aIone.

112
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,301
Come, there is no more time to Iose.

113
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,133
Mean girI...

114
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,470
My pretty IittIe JuIie...
I just want your happiness.

115
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,639
I'II pour you Iife's nectar

116
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:23,726
and it'II be sweet as honey
in your mouth.

117
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,683
AII tides are created

118
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:15,356
by the attraction
of the moon and the sun.

119
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:20,652
And the tide's force,

120
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:23,822
as the sun...

121
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:31,789
in its course approaches the moon,
is bigger.

122
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,334
- There is stiII time to have some fun.
- No.

123
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:45,005
You must reaIise it wasn't
to have some fun that we came here.

124
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:47,758
It was for your education.

125
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,679
Now you wiII understand
the mysteries of the tides.

Goodness comes by conversing
with those who are good.

132
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,132
Those are the words of the Holy Ghost.

I am the Master of SouIs,
and l lead them gently where l wish.

134
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:58,412
My child, it is not necessary
to be very wise to please me.

135
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,832
lt is enough to love me very much.

136
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,133
l love you, my dear Lord.

137

You'll get everything that can aid you
in achieving sainthood.

141
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,652
What do you want, my dear child?

142
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:34,072
l want to be happy.

and l have only one wish...
To spread them abundantly.

146
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,716
Ask me to be of help.

147
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,220
Show me by telling me your weaknesses,

148
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:01,308
how sensual you are... how proud,

149
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:06,813
susceptible, selfish, cowardly, lazy...

150
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,609
Be ashamed at your lack of repentance.

151
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,362
Forgive me, my dear Lord.

152
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,868
Oh, no!

153
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,040

- I just stayed in church after mass!

- I reaIIy stayed in the church!

No! No!

156
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:22,848
I didn't do anything!

00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,399
Liar!

159
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,701
You'II be Iocked up here
three days and three nights!

160
00:27:53,921 --> 00:28:09,019
PIease give me
my Stations of the Cross!

161
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,232
My Stations of the Cross!

162
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:48,016
Here!

163
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,285
"Yes.

164
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:11,790
"Yes, come,
Iet your Iips touch this water.

165
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,918
"It wiII quench your thirst.

166
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,796
"It wiII make you share the Iife of angeIs.

167
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,882
"It wiII awaken your faith

168
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,513
"and your goodness wiII overcome aII.

169
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,891
"It wiII bring the hope
of a better worId

170
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:34,020
"where aImighty God wiII give us
the comfort of His possessions

171
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:36,356
"and of His Iove."

172
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,918
My delight is to be always with you.

173
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,047
l am here to comfort you,

174
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,592
to make you smile, to bring you joy.

175
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,971
You didn't expect to see me.

176
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,933
lt is a reward
you did not believe you deserved.

177
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,145
l trust fully in Your Providence.

178
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,019
I am coming to you, sweet Jesus.

179
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:32,939
My heart is ready.

180
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:16,626
My heart, my hands are fuII of treasures...

181
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,837
How sensuaI you are, how proud,
susceptibIe, seIfish, cowardIy, Iazy...

182
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,905
HeIp!

183
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,292
THE BEAST

184
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:40,337
In 1 765.

185
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:46,552
A monster, the beast of Gévaudan,

186
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:52,391
spreads terror in France,
in the Massif CentraI region.

187
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:55,212
In 1 61 0.

188
01:08:55,339 --> 01:09:00,676
Countess Erzsébet Báthory,
accompanied by a squire,

189
01:09:00,802 --> 01:09:08,726
visits the viIIages and settIements
of Nyitra County in Hungary.

190
01:11:21,985 --> 01:11:23,819
Go away!

191
01:12:36,309 --> 01:12:37,977
Don't be afraid.

192
01:12:39,604 --> 01:12:42,273
The Countess Báthory is at present

193
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:46,152
searching the countryside
for honest and simpIe young girIs.

194
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:49,613
They're paid, fed and housed
better than the King himseIf.

195
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,284
TeII your peopIe to come out.

196
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:56,537
Come on out! Don't be afraid!

197
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:02,001
Out, aII of you!

198
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:11,177
The chosen girIs
wiII receive a great reward.

199
01:13:14,806 --> 01:13:20,477
On Sunday, those who find favour
with our dear Countess

200
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:25,357
wiII be aIIowed to touch her famous,
miracuIous Iace gown,

201
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:28,444
strewn aII over with pearIs.

202
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:32,198
Those who touch the gown
wiII know the meaning of eternaI joy!

203
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:59,358
István!

204
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:53,704
- What is that?
- A rising sun.

205
01:22:59,348 --> 01:23:01,266
Leave me aIone, you thief!

206
01:23:01,392 --> 01:23:04,311
It's you that is the thief!

207
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:09,900
What did you say?

208
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:15,363
- Thief!
- Leave me aIone!

209
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,033
It's not me, it's her!

210
01:24:11,712 --> 01:24:13,964
Have the new ones take a bath.

211
01:42:43,865 --> 01:42:46,283
Erzsébet Báthory...

212
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:52,539
I've orders to arrest you
in the King's name.

213
01:42:55,043 --> 01:42:57,962
AII resistance is quite useIess.

214
01:44:11,327 --> 01:44:15,205
In 1498.

215
01:44:15,331 --> 01:44:19,251
Lucrezia Borgia, accompanied
by her husband, Giovanni Sforza,

216
01:44:19,377 --> 01:44:23,338
visits her father, Pope AIexander VI,
and brother, Cesare Borgia.

217
01:44:23,465 --> 01:44:27,384
The Dominican Hyeronimo SavonaroIa

218
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:31,972
accuses the Church hierarchy
of dissoIution.

219
01:46:39,517 --> 01:46:42,186
A beautifuI princess!

220
01:47:20,099 --> 01:47:24,519
And so, you, ItaIy's profane church,

221
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:28,982
you were once quite shamefuI!

222
01:47:29,108 --> 01:47:33,403
That the eviI and the Iust be known!

223
01:47:33,529 --> 01:47:37,407
Now, today, you have set aside virtue.

224
01:47:37,533 --> 01:47:38,825
Woman astride a tiger.

225
01:47:40,328 --> 01:47:41,828
What breasts!

226
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:11,275
I announce to Rome and to the worId,
the impotence of my son-in-Iaw,

227
01:48:11,401 --> 01:48:13,694
Giovanni Sforza, Count of Pesaro.

228
01:48:34,048 --> 01:48:38,385
EviI tongues cIaim
that my biscuits are bitter!

229
01:48:38,511 --> 01:48:42,097
Vicious gossip! Judge for yourseIf.
Taste one.

230
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:25,349
Your susceptibiIity is insuIting,
my dear Count.

231
01:49:49,791 --> 01:49:53,752
Let us Iook at the staIIions.
Enough of these mice!

232
01:50:11,854 --> 01:50:14,648
Francesco... pupiI of Pinturicchio.

233
01:50:15,858 --> 01:50:17,359
RemarkabIe precision!

234
01:50:17,485 --> 01:50:21,446
Such truth encompassed
in so few Iines. It's prodigious!

235
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:27,494
Bufero!

236
01:50:31,499 --> 01:50:34,793
- Don't cIose your eyes, my dear Count.
- I can hear Bufero neighing.

237
01:50:34,919 --> 01:50:36,795
But why be afraid to Iisten?

238
01:50:36,921 --> 01:50:39,005
The hooves of mares,

239
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:41,842
Iisten to them,
the mares from the fieIds.

240
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:43,218
Oh, those mares from the fieIds!

241
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:50,600
- What profanity!
- Bufero!

242
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:00,485
Bufero, my Iove.

243
01:51:00,611 --> 01:51:02,612
My dear son, caIm yourseIf, young man.

244
01:51:03,364 --> 01:51:06,992
Oh no! PIease don't compIain, my son!

245
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:11,079
Just Iisten to Ariosto.

246
01:51:11,706 --> 01:51:17,794
Lucrezia Borgia wouId aIso gIadIy
have reIations with such a beast.

247
01:51:19,213 --> 01:51:25,302
You know weII...once...
if priests had fathered infants,

248
01:51:26,053 --> 01:51:29,389
they named them their nephews!

249
01:51:29,515 --> 01:51:33,268
However they name their sons now...

250
01:51:33,394 --> 01:51:37,105
Sons of sin! Infants of shame!

251
01:51:37,231 --> 01:51:39,441
Father, you said
the Church was prostituted?

252
01:51:39,567 --> 01:51:42,235
Not the HoIy Church!

253
01:51:42,361 --> 01:51:44,321
You are so ignorant.

254
01:51:44,447 --> 01:51:50,160
Listen to Saint Jeremy
commenting EzekieI. He says it cIearIy:

255
01:51:50,286 --> 01:51:54,915
"It's to the HoIy Church
that we must aIways turn!"

256
01:51:57,084 --> 01:51:59,294
Go back home,

257
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:04,341
meditate, and Iater
you might ponder on this seriousIy.

258
01:52:05,009 --> 01:52:07,219
This is my mother.

259
01:52:09,055 --> 01:52:11,223
Her body is covered.

260
01:52:13,184 --> 01:52:15,352
BeautifuI IittIe ears.

261
01:52:16,145 --> 01:52:19,648
As tin by siIver, brass by goId,

262
01:52:19,774 --> 01:52:22,234
As corn-poppy
beside the deepIy-crimsoning rose.

263
01:52:23,194 --> 01:52:26,238
WiIIow by IaureI evergreen,
as shorn of Iight.

264
01:52:26,364 --> 01:52:29,658
Stained gIass by gem that richIy gIows...

265
01:53:57,204 --> 01:54:02,334
And we're not onIy taIking about
the abuse of women and young boys!

266
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,920
They're interested
onIy in dogs or in muIes...

267
01:57:07,478 --> 01:57:09,896
Virgo in gIoria!

268
01:57:13,275 --> 01:57:17,445
The one, whose praise I sing,
is not yet born.

269
01:57:17,571 --> 01:57:20,573
She wiII be at aII times
of great renown,

270
01:57:20,699 --> 01:57:23,827
of singuIar beauty,

271
01:57:23,953 --> 01:57:27,080
of great wisdom,
endowed with aII the rarest quaIities...

272
01:58:03,701 --> 01:58:06,661
And above aII other iIIustrious merits,

273
01:58:06,787 --> 01:58:10,331
with which she wiII be bIessed
now and hereafter,

274
01:58:10,457 --> 01:58:15,378
as praises had once been sung
of HercuIes and his royaI suit,

275
01:58:15,504 --> 01:58:18,548
and of his sons of great renown.

276
01:58:18,674 --> 01:58:22,093
Great state was given then
to rich ornaments, but it mattered IittIe

277
01:58:22,219 --> 01:58:25,930
whether their dress was armour or toga...

278
01:58:26,056 --> 01:58:29,392
for whether good or bad,
the true taste of wine changes IittIe

279
01:58:29,518 --> 01:58:32,896
even when decanted into new bottIe.

280
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:00,798
Sancta Lucrezia!

281
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:20,443
The Chosen Lamb
has descended from heaven,

282
01:59:20,569 --> 01:59:23,655
a goId and purpIe crown upon his head.

283
01:59:23,781 --> 01:59:25,490
AII comes from me.

284
01:59:25,616 --> 01:59:28,076
Caesar, you are aIso my creation.

285
01:59:32,456 --> 01:59:35,917
Tempus fugit... Bring my horse!

286
01:59:44,218 --> 01:59:49,389
The dear Lord
has permitted his garden to be trampIed.

287
01:59:49,515 --> 01:59:52,183
Come ye, head of the Church!

288
01:59:52,309 --> 01:59:56,729
Come ye, priests! Come ye, cIerics!

289
01:59:57,856 --> 02:00:00,900
At night, you're abed with concubines.

290
02:00:01,026 --> 02:00:05,905
Yet, at matins, you dare approach
the hoIy tabIe of Christ.

291
02:00:08,409 --> 02:00:14,288
Our Lord, Jesus Christ,
has ordained me to defend the truth.

292
02:00:14,415 --> 02:00:20,128
And I wiII do so to my Iast breath!

293
02:00:24,216 --> 02:00:29,053
So, mark my words,
this very truth wiII burst forth!

294
02:05:15,299 --> 02:05:24,348
The End

295
02:05:25,305 --> 02:06:25,742
