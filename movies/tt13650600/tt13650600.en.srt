2
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,693
Don't do that.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

3
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,277
What's-what's wrong? What's the matter?

4
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,845
She like your big head.

5
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,597
She's craving that BBC.

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,515
Or small BC. I don't fucking know.

7
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:57,879
- I ain't seen your dick.
- Okay.

8
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,518
We are graduating in two months.

9
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:00,996
- Mm-hmm.
- And what-what am I gonna do,

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,414
just start something so we can break up?

11
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,356
I don't want to do that.

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,067
Mm, I'm sure you could just fuck, Le.

13
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,444
Look, we only gonna be living

14
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,987
30 minutes away from here next year.

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,031
Campus ain't gonna be that far.

16
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,283
You can just fuck. You can just fuck.

17
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:20,706
- You bitch!
- Whoa, whoa.

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,100
- Not-not you. Not you.
- No, oh, I'm-I'm so...

19
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,602
- I'm so sorry.
- No, not you. He did not...

20
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,020
- I am so sorry.
- What are you doing?

21
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,588
No, fucking Victor gave away our passes.

22
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,340
- Hey, look.
- Fucking dingleberry.

23
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,424
You called him a what?

24
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:31,902
- A dingleberry.
- Okay, calm-calm...

25
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:32,986
Dingle up your asshole,
because he ain't worth shit.

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,237
Okay, calm... calm down, calm down.

27
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,614
Look, you'll be able...
we'll figure it out.

28
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:36,847
Come on, let's just go.

29
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,931
- It's not the end of the world. It's okay.
- Shit.

30
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,644
- For you, it's not.
- We're okay.

31
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,688
Hi, class. Sorry I'm late.

32
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,899
Whew, goodness.

33
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,776
Okay, so if you've done the reading...

34
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,778
Which you should have...

35
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,656
You'd have noticed that there's
a big old trigger warning

36
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,617
next to the syllabus on today's class.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,994
And I know that we're
inches away from spring break,

38
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,831
but if you could just maintain
your focus and respectability

39
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,041
till the end of the day,
I'll be most appreciative.

40
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,043
Okay, so we good to go?

41
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,504
- I found some extra tickets to Blackout.
- Really?

42
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,023
So we've been talking about

43
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,882
the power of language,

44
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,553
and today we're going to be
talking about hate speech.

45
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,514
Now, before I go any further,

46
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,307
I just feel like I need to restate

47
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,934
the trigger warning, so are we good?

48
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,354
- That's cute.
- Stop.

49
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,983
Yeah, okay, so let's
talk about the infamous...

50
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,485
...N-word.

51
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:40,411
The word "nigger" has had a
very long and terrible history.

52
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:46,292
It occupies a unique space in
the modern American vernacular.

53
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,169
The word's so taboo that it's
clearly making a lot of you

54
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,690
feel uncomfortable with me just
saying it right here right now

55
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,800
in a very isolated academic context.

56
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:57,678
Now, my question is to you lot:

57
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:02,266
What makes this word so powerful?

58
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,685
Anybody.

59
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,186
Yes.

60
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,273
I mean, because it's racist.

61
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:13,360
I think we could
all agree it is racist, yes.

62
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,154
But there are many racist,
offensive words.

63
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,655
What makes "nigger" different?

64
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,240
It originates from the Spanish...

65
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,451
Hey. Is that shit even allowed?

66
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,286
It's on the syllabus.

67
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,915
Um, there-there was a...
a trigger warning.

68
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,374
Trigger warning, these nuts.

69
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,436
- That shit is not right.
- And then, of course,

70
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,295
with an "A" at the end, we've got "nigga."

71
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,213
Bro, she keeps fucking saying it.

72
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,983
- Okay.
- She just said "nigga" three times.

73
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,175
But, uh, okay.

74
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,093
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

75
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,905
- Ask her. Inquire about it.
- I-m-I'm not asking her.

76
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,448
- Ask her, Kunle.
- I'm not gonna ask her.

77
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,657
You don't want to ask. Ask her.

78
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,742
She can't answer this question?

79
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,059
She's British.

80
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,727
May-Maybe she just doesn't know.

81
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,687
Give a fuck if she British, boy?

82
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,522
Ask her, why is she teaching a class

83
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,816
on some shit she don't know shit about?

84
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,152
I, um, don't want to put you two

85
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,238
on the spot or anything, but...

86
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,324
you must have something to say.

87
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,370
Please. This is a safe space.

88
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,873
What do you think it is that
keeps this word so powerful?

89
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,756
Look, it was...

90
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,383
Sean, if it bothered you so much,

91
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,051
you could have said something.

92
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,303
You could have said anything.
You didn't say a word.

93
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,627
You just... you just sat there.

94
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,516
Yeah, in silent protest.

95
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,184
- Okay, silent protest.
- Kunle?

96
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,436
Oh, shit. Okay, okay, um... act cool.

97
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,289
- Do I have anything in my nose? I'm okay?
- Kunle.

98
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,524
- Hey. Guys.
- Just be cool. Be cool, Sean. Be cool.

99
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,484
- Hi.
- Hey.

100
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,486
That was... ooh.

101
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,654
W-Weird.

102
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,322
Fucked-up is what it was.

103
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:43,051
- She should not have put you guys on the spot like that.
- No.

104
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,327
I'm on the Student Senate,
if you guys want to, like,

105
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,329
start a movement or something.

106
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,540
- Uh...
- But it's totally up to you.

107
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,041
Like, no pressure.

108
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,335
Yeah, no, no, no. No, pressure. We, um...

109
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,338
- We will think about it.
- Cool.

110
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,340
Yeah, uh...

111
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,926
So, uh, you...

112
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,429
So, you going out tonight, B?

113
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,265
Uh, for once, I am.

114
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,975
- Mm.
- Yeah, got a pass to Underground.

115
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,977
- Nice. Nice.
- Oh, shit.

116
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,353
Nice. That's really good.

117
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,230
Yeah. Are-are you guys?

118
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,066
Yeah. Yeah, we're just gonna go
to a couple parties and...

119
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,359
Cool.

120
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,361
Seven parties, actually.

121
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,405
Are you guys doing a Legendary Tour?

122
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,907
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow, wow, wow.

123
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,744
It took me
three weeks of ass kissing

124
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,537
just to get into one.

125
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,681
- Oof.
- Lot of butt.

126
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,706
So... lot of butt.

127
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,850
- Oh, God.
- Lot of butt.

128
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,274
Good thing you didn't get pink eye.

129
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,129
From all the ass kissing.

130
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,008
Yeah, it's not really...
it's not really about

131
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,926
the, uh... the-the parties, though.

132
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,970
It's just this inside joke
that-that we've had

133
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,430
- since freshman year.
- Oh.

134
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,932
We actually are gonna be
the first Black men

135
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,643
to complete a Legendary Tour here
at Buchanan.

136
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,228
- Right.
- Is that...

137
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,522
like, something that people keep track of?

138
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,524
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

139
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,735
<i>See, the Black Student Union,</i>

140
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,945
<i>right, they got this thing
called the Hall of Firsts.</i>

147

152
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,219
- Right.
- We're actually going to get

153
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,304
- our Blackout passes right now.
- Right.

154
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,865
- Cool. Text me.
- I'll te... I'll text you.

155
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,682
- Okay.
- Bye.

156
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,017
Bye.

157
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,689
She wants your dick, bro.

158
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:38,816
No, she's just being nice.

159
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,110
Yeah, she is being nice... to your dick.

160
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,121
Wait, okay, on-on the other hand,

161
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,039
it's a class about blasphemy and taboos.

162
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,043
Like, it's literally called
Blasphemy and Taboos.

163
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,543
- Mm-hmm.
- If we got her fired,

164
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,253
would that be censorship?

165
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,796
'Cause I'm against censorship.

166
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,981
That was some willy-nilly-ass shit.

167
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,233
Like, she didn't have to say it.

168
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,818
She just wanted to. She wanted a reaction.

169
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:05,968
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

170
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,654
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

171
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,013
But that was kind of the point, right?

172
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,765
To analyze us.

173
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,518
She wants to analyze
why we reacted that way.

174
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,186
Like, why is it so bad?

175
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,438
Think about this. So, there's a white man.

176
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,357
He's in the woods alone, all right?

177
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,025
He says the N-word. Is it bad?

178
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,735
Wait, your white man goes to the forest

179
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,588
- just to say the N-word?
- Well, no, no. He's never...

180
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,298
He... Okay, think about it.
He's never said it before.

181
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,842
- Uh-huh.
- He will never say it again.

182
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,826
And he doesn't hate us.
He's not, like, that type.

183
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,829
He just wants to just
whisper it quietly to himself.

184
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,831
You, just, you know...

185
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,291
"Nigger."

186
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,334
It's fucked-up, dummy.

187
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,003
- What?
- What? That's fucked...

188
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,689
You're such an Oreo, trying to justify it.

189
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,256
I'm not... I'm not a...

190
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,984
- Okay, think about this...
- Look, look, look. Look, calm down.

191
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,277
You're thinking about it
too much, all right?

192
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,719
It's not that complicated.

193
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,346
We got one rule that we ask
for white people to respect.

194
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,190
- Mm-hmm.
- Thou shalt not say this one word.

195
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,474
- Right?
- Right.

196
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,560
But they don't like for us
to tell them what to do.

197
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,353
So they find loopholes.

198
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,398
So when your white man says
"nigger" in the forest,

199
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,609
he breaketh the covenant, all right?

200
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,903
It's not, like, evil-evil,

201
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,363
like, you know, "rawr,"

202
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,823
but it's disrespectful.

203
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,627
- Right.
- Anybody ever called you a nigger?

204
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,035
You call me "nigga" all the time.

205
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,329
No, nigga, not like that. I mean, like...

206
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,914
To your fucking face.

207
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,373
Yeah, I don't know, like, online,

208
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,625
people say the word, like...

209
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,084
No, not-not online.

210
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,296
Like, disrespectful,
right here to your face.

211
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,547
No.

212
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,382
Oh, well, fuck it.

213
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,768
I just can't go too hard tonight.

214
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,811
I have to be back here
really early in the morning

215
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,021
to check my cultures.

216
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,273
You sound like a young mom, Le.

217
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,193
Them like your little fungus babies.

218
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,876
They are the bacteria.

219
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,780
And yes, they are my little babies.

220
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,114
Mm-hmm.

221
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,950
Yeah, who's gonna get Daddy published?

222
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,743
Hmm? Who? We are.

223
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,370
Yes, you are.

224
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,623
What?

225
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,793
You think maybe you should, I don't know,

226
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,920
work on your thesis this week?

227
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,130
'Cause your paper will not write itself.

228
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,608
- Hey, look, it's a break.
- I'm just saying.

229
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,259
- It's a break, Kunle.
- I'm just saying.

230
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,468
Spring break. "Break."

231
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,844
That's what it means, all right?

232
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,555
I got like three weeks
till it's due anyway, so...

233
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,641
I'm good.

234
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,143
Okay, but...

235
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,021
Yeah, I'm doing it.
No, I'm saying it. Look.

236
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,690
Three weeks is nothing.

237
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,817
If we can't get into all seven parties,

238
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,443
it's not the end of the world,

239
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,837
but it will be the end of the world

240
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,196
if you do not graduate.

241
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,990
Okay, do not downplay what the fuck

242
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,533
we doing tonight, all right?

243
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,076
We are making history.

244
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,012
- Get your priorities straight, Kunle.
- -My pri...

245
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,764
- Okay. All right, all right.
- Get your priorities straight.

246
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,456
All right.

247
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,293
What is this?

248
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,422
Oh, Jesus.

249
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,549
- Wh-What is this?
- It's death punch.

250
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,135
We got to get a buzz, bitch.
We on a schedule, all right?

251
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,095
I'm gonna be back.
Hurry up with all this shit.

252
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,596
And finish that little bottle.

253
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,765
- "Little bottle"?
- Finish it!

254
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,310
There's, like, a whole lot in here.

255
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,689
I am not drinking that.

256
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,111
Here you are, bruh.

257
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,322
Yes, yes. Thank you.
I really fucking owe you one.

258
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,466
Yeah, yeah, of course you do.
You actually got lucky.

259
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,302
I was about to give those
to a cute freshman chick.

260
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,744
Oh, my bad.

261
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,805
Bruh, we were getting attached,
and then she want to say,

262
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,247
"Oh, look, I got a boyfriend."

263
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,874
And it's just, are you serious?

264
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,935
Like, I'm getting emotional.
I'm an emotional person.

265
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,519
But, I mean, I don't care at this point

266
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,629
because I can just do my own thing

267
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,274
until, you know, she's done with her man,

268
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,984
- Mm-hmm. Word, word.
- But your future ex.

269
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,736
- All right, I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah, yeah, but...

270
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,362
- Yeah, so... Yeah.
- Thank you again.

271
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,721
Hey, Asa. Asa, hey.

272
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,182
Wait, where you gonna be tonight?

273
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,434
- Equinox and Underground.
- Yeah?

274
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,102
Okay, well, me and Kunle, too.

275
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,563
We're finally gonna finish
our Legendary Tour, thanks.

276
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,357
- Mm, for real?
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,817
Sounds intense and possibly ill-advised.

278
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,111
Well, "intense and possibly ill-advised"

279
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,740
is the tag line for our night,
so that works for me.

280
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,160
Well, as your friend, I just
want to say for the record

281
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,204
maybe you should take it easy.

282
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,333
I can't, because
we're making history, but...

283
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,418
No, I'm serious, though.

284
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,229
You don't...
You didn't have to do all that.

285
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,933
Look, you're gonna do
what you're gonna do.

286
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,299
Just don't be dragging Kunle
into some bullshit.

287
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,301
That boy is Black excellence,

288
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,428
and there's still hope for him.

289
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,723
Bye, Sean.

290
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,396
<i>Your anti sent you a package.</i>

291
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,647
<i>Did you get it?</i>

292
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,358
Oh, oh, I, uh...
I-I haven't been home yet.

293
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,628
Remember to call her and say thank you.

294
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,154
I told her you got into Princeton

295
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,198
and you'll be doing your PhD there.

296
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,259
Now she is telling everyone
you're going to be a doctor.

297
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,994
I didn't have the heart to tell her

298
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,164
- it's not that kind of doctor.
- Ah.

299
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:50,001
Well, uh, technically,
I still will be a doctor,

300
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,711
just not of medicine.

301
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,713
It's not too late to go to med school.

302
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,900
- Mama. Mama.
- You would be a wonderful cardiologist.

303
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,110
Boom, bitch!

304
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,764
You ready to fucking party?

305
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,765
- Party?
- Oh.

306
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,308
Kunle, what party?

307
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,661
- Oh, shit.
- No, it's not a party.

308
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,603
No, it's not a party. It's just Sean and I

309
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,207
hanging out with some friends tonight.

310
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,815
Why are you going to a party?

311
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,378
You should be working on your thesis.

312
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,402
I'm-I'm working on it.

313
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,281
I am literally in the lab
working on it right-right now.

314
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,283
I don't like that Sean boy.

315
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,160
He is a bad influence.

316
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,870
Undisciplined.

317
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,247
On his Instagram, he's always vaping.

318
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,499
Tell him that vaping
is bad for his health.

319
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,501
You don't vape, do you?

320
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,795
No. It's bad for you.

321
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,380
Oh, I have a patient.

322
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,632
I have to go. Remember to call Anti.

323
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,551
Okay. Okay. Bye, Mom.

324
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,428
Eh-huh.

325
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,264
Sean! My mom told me to tell you

326
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,349
that vaping is bad for you,

327
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,101
so please block her on Instagram.

328
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,187
No.

329
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,314
I'm actually fucking scared of your mama.

330
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,815
I feel like she'll call me

331
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,609
and make me unblock her if I did.

332
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,652
Now, come here. Let me show you this.

333
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,070
What is it?

334
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,083
Okay, this is a lot.

335
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,586
I know it is, but pay attention
to what I'm about to say.

336
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,463
Our Legendary Tour.

337
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,632
Look, we're gonna start at Blackout,

338
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,800
and then we're gonna head east, all right?

339
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,469
Now, Blackout...

340
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,069
<i>This is essential.</i>

341
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,403
<i>Gonna have an ice luge,</i>

342
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,964
<i>so we need to make sure
that we get there early</i>

343
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,174
<i>before it gets all gross and shit.</i>

344
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,699
<i>I don't like backwash.</i>

345
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,870
<i>Play two rounds of beer pong,</i>

346
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:51,623
<i>and then we head our beautiful
asses over to the Green Room.</i>

347
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,629
<i>The Green Room, we don't use front doors.</i>

348
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,006
<i>We go at the side door.</i>

349
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,384
<i>Give 'em the password,
get escorted upstairs,</i>

350
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,885
<i>have a great fucking time.</i>

351
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,229
<i>At the Green Room,</i>

352
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,481
<i>you do not eat any of
the baked snacks, all right?</i>

353
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,984
<i>Unless you want to be high
out your motherfucking mind.</i>

354
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,318
<i>Trust me, I would know.</i>

355
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,872
Now, steps three through five,
we have to get through quick.

356
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,833
<i>Zeta Eta Theta.</i>

357
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,545
<i>I know it's lame, but we got to do it.</i>

358
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,799
<i>Omicron Phi Kappa.</i>

359
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,426
<i>They're ABC.</i>

360
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,052
<i>It means "anything but clothes."</i>

361
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,762
<i>It could get interesting.</i>

362
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:51,683
<i>From there, we go for a little refill stop
at Tri-Phi, right?</i>

363
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,727
<i>All energy drinks is what we need</i>

364
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,229
<i>to then make it to number six:</i>

365
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,148
<i>Equinox.</i>

366
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,241
<i>Asa's gonna be there.</i>

367
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,876
<i>Wait.</i>

368
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,252
You guys are talking again?

369
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,463
Yep.

370
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,840
Like-like friends talking,
or are you, like...

371
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,052
We'll see.

372
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,722
<i>And then down to the last and the final
and the best one:</i>

373
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,349
<i>Underground.</i>

374
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,975
<i>Then you take Bianca home,</i>

375
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:38,271
<i>I take home an even more
attractive young lady,</i>

376
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,273
<i>and that is our night.</i>

377
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,150
Any questions?

378
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,945
Oh, yeah. Did you get
an extra pass for Carlos?

379
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,781
Kunle, no,

380
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,117
I did not get an extra pass
for Carlos, bro.

381
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,453
It was already hard enough
to get two passes.

382
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,748
I'm not wasting a fucking favor
on Winnie-the-Pooh, all right?

383
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,792
What would he even be like if he went?

384
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,335
Huh? Think about it.

385
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,687
The fanny pack. I already know. Yeah...

386
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,439
He gonna insist on wearing
that fucking fanny pack.

387
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,924
But it's his thing.
This is... it's his attire.

388
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,760
He'd probably scare off every woman
within like a hundred-mile radius

389
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,428
by offering 'em a fucking granola bar.

390
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,514
I don't have time
for that type of stuff, okay?

391
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,784
He's been playing video games
since his class yesterday.

392
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,288
He actually hasn't left his room yet.

393
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,853
We probably won't see Carlos
for like the rest of the week.

394
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,522
Oh, shit. Come on, come on.

395
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,315
- What?
- It's 7:00. We need to go.

396
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,942
Pregame, and we got to get food.

397
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,961
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

398
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,421
Let's fuck it up!

399
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,114
Let's fuck it up, man.

400
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,602
Oh, shit.

401
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,771
- What?
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

402
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,022
- Did I lock it?
- What?

403
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,733
Did... No, did I... did I lock it?

404
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,151
My-my-my-my cultures.

405
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,694
I forgot to lock the fridge.

406
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,362
- Oh, um, I got to go back.
- Hey!

407
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,589
Hey, what the fuck is you doing?

408
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,133
- Yes.
- We only got 30 minutes to go pregame

409
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,592
and then make it to Blackout, all right?

410
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,216
Can't you just call one of our lab mates

411
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,846
- and have them do that?
- No, no, no, no.

412
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,372
I need to lock it closed with
the key or else it comes open.

413
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,392
Just... they-they can jam it
with a fork or some shit.

414
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,018
What are you talking about,
"a fork or some shit"?

415
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,520
- Well...
- Wh-What are you talking about?

416
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,712
Just until tomorrow, Kunle.

417
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,189
- Calm the fuck down.
- This is my thesis.

418
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,757
- Okay, I understand.
- All right?

419
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,426
My cultures need to be at the
right temperature and humidity,

420
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,136
or else they will die.

421
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,597
Can't-can't we just skip the pregame?

422
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,683
No. You never skip the pregame, fool.

423
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,727
It's just gonna fuck up
the whole schedule, Kunle.

424
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,188
Okay, okay. Um, you just go without me,

425
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,856
and I will meet you there.

426
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,483
- I'll meet you there.
- Fucking...

427
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,610
No, I... look, I'ma take you, okay?

428
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,504
But we only gonna have
five minutes when we get back

429
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,447
to pregame, change and leave, okay?

430
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,782
Okay, cool.

431
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,868
I can make us a Ginnamon Toast Crunch.

432
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,829
It sounds weird, but it is delicious.

433
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,832
Like, we were in the house
one night, and we were baked,

434
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,752
but all we had was the alcohol
and the cereal, and...

435
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,296
Mother... I know damn well
he didn't leave

436
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,059
- this fucking door open again.
- Hey, hey.

437
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,175
Don't go in there yelling, okay?

438
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,344
Carlos!

439
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:19,057
Hey! Motherfucker,
my PS4 better still be here.

440
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,525
All right, I got the game.

441
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,068
It's cool.

442
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,571
Yeah?

443
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,532
And my shoes.

444
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,081
I got the weed.

445
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,833
Okay.

446
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,004
Okay.

447
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,924
Anything missing out there?

448
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,677
Um...

449
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,764
Everything here except
Winnie-the-fucking-Pooh.

450
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,393
- So I'm gonna hide his weed...
- Sean. Sean.

451
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,019
What?

452
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,360
The fuck?

453
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,070
Okay, um...

454
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,823
Okay.

455
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,242
Hello? Hello.

456
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,246
Hey, yo, wake up!

457
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,957
Hey! Wake up!

458
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,625
- Okay, okay.
- What the fuck?

459
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,294
Um...

460
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,047
No, hey! Don't touch her.

461
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,884
This could possibly be a crime scene.

462
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,594
Well, we need... Uh, w-w...

463
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,471
Okay. Okay, she's-she's alive.

464
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:41,848
She's breathing.

465
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,518
Her-her pulse is fast,
but her breathing is slow.

466
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,606
Okay, okay, okay.

467
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,733
All right. Um...

468
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:52,901
Okay.

469
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,779
We should call...
we should call 911.

470
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,907
Carlos.

471
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,659
Kunle.

472
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,912
Kunle, I'm too high for this shit.

473
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,371
What if he's dead, bro?

474
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,458
- He's not dead. He's not dead.
- All right. Okay.

475
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,667
Go look.

476
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,377
Go see. Go check. Go do whatever.

477
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,837
Okay. Come on.

478
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,881
Me and you, me and you,
me and you, me and you.

479
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,342
I'm-I'm right behind you.
Right behind you.

480
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,642
- You're right behind me?
- Motherfucker, just go!

481
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,518
Los?

482
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,826
Okay.

483
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,453
Hey.

484
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,788
Carlos?

485
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,084
Hey. Hey, hey.

486
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,585
Jesus.

487
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,003
- You got me.
- Right.

488
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,731
I'm-I'm presently at war with the Russians

489
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,007
and the Persian Empire,
so shit is about to get… -Okay.

490
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,218
Okay, but do you know the girl out here?

491
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,345
Hold on a second. Wait.

492
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,596
Look.

493
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,932
- Hey, hey.
- This is a single-player game.

494
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,767
- You can pause.
- Mess up my sensitivity.

495
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,519
Now, there's a girl on...

496
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,397
Ah, girl problems, huh?

497
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,357
What, is it Bianca? Is it someone I know?

498
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,150
What-what's going on?

499
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,944
Ew.

500
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,279
There is an unconscious
white girl in our living room.

501
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,201
What?

502
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,924
Hey, hey, Kunle!

503
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,454
Kunle, Kunle, she's throwing up!

504
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,956
Oh, hey, hey, Kunle!

505
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,499
Kunle, she erupting.

506
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,251
She throwing, bro. She throwing up.

507
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:36,963
Who-who is she?

508
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,007
We-we don't know.

509
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,383
Where's Maddy?

510
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,760
Hey. Hey, hey. What'd you say?

511
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,804
What-what... what did you say?

512
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,407
Can you go tell her I feel really weird?

513
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,866
Ooh, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.

514
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,058
Hey, stop touching.

515
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,144
- Stop touching.
- No, I cannot stop touching.

516
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,812
Look, we have to keep her on her side.

517
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,189
All right? Or else she could
inhale vomit and die.

518
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,817
Look, just trust me.
I'm first aid certified.

519
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,402
That's... Okay.

520
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,696
Hey, what's your name?

521
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,322
What's your...

522
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,617
Okay. All right, um...

523
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,454
We should call 911, right?

524
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,205
- Yes...
- No, no. Hey, stop. -Yes.

525
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,124
- What? What?
- Stop. Are you fucking crazy?

526
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,625
Do you not know what they'll think

527
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,877
when they come and see this?

528
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,462
They're gonna shoot us and arrest us

529
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,856
for killing this little white girl.

530
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,840
Shoot us and arrest us?

531
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,383
- Yes.
- Come on, man.

532
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,611
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.

533
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,679
Okay, listen.

534
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,889
What the fuck are you...

535
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,932
We don't have to do nothing wrong, Kunle.

536
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,268
Just be in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

537
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,519
Which we are!

538
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,812
Down white girl.

539
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,522
House that reeks of weed.

540
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:40,026
Your fingerprints and DNA
are all over her, Touchy Tim.

541
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,962
And, Carlos, you were here
the whole fucking time.

542
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,321
What's your alibi, huh?

543
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,906
Uh...

544
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,867
Guys, we're just gonna tell 'em
we came home...

545
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,678
- Kunle. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- She was on the floor.

546
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,370
They not gonna listen, all right?

547
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,640
The cops don't know that you're
basically white on the inside.

548
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,142
- Don't start that right now...
- What? I'm being honest.

549
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,019
Bitch, that's honest information.
Don't get mad.

550
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,669
They're not gonna listen.

551
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,647
They're just gonna come in here
and see three Brown guys

552
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,757
hanging over this little white girl.

553
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,801
Do y'all not see how fucked that is?

554
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,493
Perhaps we could persuade a friend

555
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,870
to call 911 for us.

556
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:37,708
Someone a-a little less, um... you know.

557
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,293
What, Brown?

558
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:40,711
So a white person.

559
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,840
A female would be preferable.

560
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,677
Um, we could... we could call Bianca.

561
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,680
I mean, she cool,
but she don't know all of us that well.

562
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,014
Okay, who knows us?

563
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,975
Um... Asa.

564
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,979
I would rather not put my life
in the hands of my ex.

565
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,731
Plus, she a Black queen.
We need a white girl.

566
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,608
Um...

567
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,277
It's funny, I-I-I...

568
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,737
I don't know too many
of my white female peers.

569
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,281
It's troubling.

570
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,991
Um...

571
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,534
Oh, oh, we-we could call

572
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,703
- White Sean, the football player.
- Ooh...

573
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,472
Football players never get
in trouble, right?

574
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,040
White Sean, White Sean.
Ooh, come on, White Sean.

575
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,877
Come on.

576
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,354
Oh, what's up, Sean?

577
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,921
Hey, hey, White Sean.

578
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:26,090
- Where are you?
- Uh, I'm actually on

579
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,509
a microbrewery tour with my mom.

580
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,887
- So you're not on campus?
- Nah.

581
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,031
- Fuck.
- You know, you know, man, I didn't think I'd like this...

582
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,808
Um, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, got to go.

583
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,769
Okay, who else can we call?
Come on, come on, come on.

584
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,563
Brian Phan?

585
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,856
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

586
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,819
Asians... they, like,
fucking neutral to police.

587
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,153
No. Brian is in Cabo for break.

588
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,006
Oh, fuck, y'all,
we are one percent of the school.

589
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,324
How the fuck don't we know
any white people?

590
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,910
Maybe we just over thinking right now.

591
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,916
Hey. Hey, yo!

592
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,209
Yeah, there she go.

593
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:04,712
Hey. You got anybody
that you want us to call?

594
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,340
Or, like, a-a friend or
a phone or something?

595
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,258
She cannot be on her back.

596
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,777
- Okay, okay, all right, all right.
- The touching.

597
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,641
- It's the touching.
- Come on, come on.

598
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,072
Okay, so what do we know? What do we know?
What do we know?

599
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,433
This girl got drunk
and came here on accident.

600
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,935
Like Goldilocks.

601
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,853
And we're the three bears.

602
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,397
Please don't. Please don't.

603
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,608
Let's... leave it alone. Leave it alone.

604
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,777
Don't-don't...

605
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,630
All right, and look at what she's wearing.

606
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,988
Anything but clothes.

607
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,907
She was at Omicron.

608
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,785
We could just take her ass back.

609
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,328
And do what?

610
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,081
What, just-just walk in with her?

611
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,415
No, not walk in with her.

612
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,739
Lay her outside where somebody
can find her and help her.

613
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,837
Your plan is to dump the unconscious girl

614
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,257
outside of the frat party?

615
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,508
Yeah.

616
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,389
No, no. No, you right.

617
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,533
- Nah. It's not...
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

618
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,911
- Somebody... Yeah, somebody... People could see us.
- Yeah.

619
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,395
Draw conclusions, all that bad shit.

620
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,854
Drunk people, lots of eyes.

621
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,148
- Yeah.
- That's difficult.

622
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,944
Also, fellas, she's fucking unconscious.

623
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,445
We can't just leave her somewhere.

624
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,173
- Right? Right?
- Okay. Okay. Okay. -CARLOS: Right.

625
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,877
What the fuck is wrong with you two?

626
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,033
What, you got a better idea?

627
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,369
Yes. We call 911.

628
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,204
Or we could just let her sleep it off.

629
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,789
Okay? I've been this drunk before.

630
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,767
- Y'all know that shit.
- Yeah. He always wakes up.

631
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,686
Come on,
you know I've been this drunk before.

632
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,295
We don't even know if she's drunk.

633
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,088
What if she's, like, roofied?

634
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,092
Why'd you have to come here, huh?

635
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,802
Why'd you have to come here?

636
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,679
'Cause it was just right.

637
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,389
It's not hot, it's not too cold.

638
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,017
It was just right.

639
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,601
Sorry. I'm sorry.

640
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,936
Fuck this. Fuck this.

641
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,271
This not my problem.

642
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,231
What the fuck?
I mean, this not our problem.

643
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,524
This is our problem.

644
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,109
She is already in our house.

645
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,170
- Yeah, because you don't know how to lock the door, Carlos.
- What?

646
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,506
- We've talked about this shit.
- Okay. All right, all right, look, look.

647
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,050
Why wouldn't you just let me call 911?

648
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,325
Now w-we've waited too long,

649
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,927
it's gonna look weird
that we haven't called.

650
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,013
Well, then it's a good thing
that we're not calling, Kunle.

651
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,330
We got to do something.

652
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,849
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

653
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:04,999
Oh, shit.

654
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,242
Okay, hey.

655
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,352
- Fuck this.
- All right.

656
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,919
I'm-I'm doing it. I'm calling 911.

657
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,981
- Don't. Kunle, do not call 911, all right?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait...

658
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,524
- Call 911, right? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
- Don't do it. Don't grab it.

659
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,133
Ah, you nasty bitch.

660
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,302
- You nasty.
- All right.

661
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,113
That's…
You should've just left it there.

662
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,889
- Just leave it there.
- Ew. Ew.

663
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,141
- We all use that blanket.
- Kunle, Kunle, look.

664
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,744
- Hey, look, I'm so serious.
- I'm calling 911.

665
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,561
- Sean, Sean.
- Do not... Shut up. Shut up.

666
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,414
- Get the fuck off of me, Sean!
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

667
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,939
- I'm serious.
- Make me. Shut up.

668
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,275
- Get off of me.
- No.

669
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,402
- Put the phone down, Kunle.
- Los?

670
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,279
Lower the phone.

671
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:38,324
What if... what if...

672
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,409
we take her to the hospital?

673
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,538
All right? Just say that we found her.

674
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,790
It's the truth.

675
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,059
That's actually not a bad idea.

676
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,335
I apologize for getting in your circle.

677
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,087
Hospital's not too far.

678
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,671
It's like, what, ten minutes?

679
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,840
This will take us thir...
a half hour, tops.

680
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,510
Um, I still need to get back
to the lab, but I think

681
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,137
that we'll have enough time
to make it to Blackout.

682
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,931
- Wait, Blackout?
- Fu...

683
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,266
Did y… Are we going to Blackout?

684
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,811
Excuse my French, but fuck yes.

685
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:11,023
I am most assuredly gonna need
a drink after all this.

686
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,526
Right. Right, so, uh...

687
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,409
We don't want to give 'em
a reason to stop us,

688
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,779
so we need to change, all right?

689
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,489
No hats, no hoodies.

690
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,990
No weird shit, Carlos, all right?

691
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,367
What, Saturn?

692
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,702
Everything you have on
right now, all right?

693
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,288
Kunle, we're gonna need
to borrow some of your clothes.

694
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,707
- My stuff?
- Yeah, the whole substitute teacher look.

695
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,292
It's...

696
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,920
That's fair. That's fair. Okay.

697
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,084
Shit.

698
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,836
She a little heavy.

699
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,970
Shotgun.

700
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,687
Perhaps Goldilocks
should eat something.

701
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,522
I got some granola bars.

702
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,692
Ready to do this?

703
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,481
Emma? Emma!

704
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,401
- Hey, what the fuck!
- Shit. Sorry.

705
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,394
Oh, my God. Fuck you, don't.

706
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,128
Alice.

707
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,548
- Oh, my...
- Alice, have you seen Emma?

708
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,633
No, not since we got here.

709
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,069
Okay, well, can you see her from up there?

710
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,135
Turn this way.

711
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,428
- Turn?
- Yeah.

712
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,013
Mm...

713
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,182
No.

714
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,435
Just, like, call her or something.

715
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,604
I called her, Alice. I'm not an idiot.

716
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,606
Okay. Geez.

717
00:30:58,732 --> 00:30:59,918
- Okay. Okay.
- Do you want to...

718
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,110
Just put me down.

719
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,990
Sorry, what's going on?

720
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,575
What?

721
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,458
I don't know you.
I want to talk to my friend.

722
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,328
Okay, just one second, okay?

723
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,664
Okay. Um, wh, um...

724
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,791
Do you remember where you last saw her?

725
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,918
She was playing...

726
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,004
- beer pong with some people.
- Beer pong. Okay.

727
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,214
With some people,
but that was a long time ago.

728
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,008
- A long time ago?
- So I don't remember.

729
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,635
How-how long ago? Like-like half an hour?

730
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,888
Uh, it was like an hour
or maybe two, actually.

731
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:30,973
Two hours, Maddy?

732
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,325
She could literally be anywhere.

733
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,184
- I know!
- Okay. Okay.

734
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,604
- Okay.
- Uh, so who are we looking for?

735
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,290
- Who the fuck are you? Why...
- No, no. Maddy.

736
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,833
- Why do you keep coming back?
- Maddy.

737
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,108
This is Rafael.

738
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,611
- He's from my Arab-Israeli conflict seminar.
- Yo.

739
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,155
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know.

740
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,906
Okay. I'm sorry.

741
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,830
Hi. I didn't...
I thought you were some ran do.

742
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,411
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- Okay, um...

743
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,955
She's probably still here
somewhere, right?

744
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,683
Like, literally, who...
who are you looking for?

745
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,876
My sister, Emma.

746
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:01,879
She's pretty.

747
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,883
Sean.

748
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,052
You're driving too slow.

749
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,262
No, I'm not. It's fine.

750
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,473
Okay, driving too slow looks weird.

751
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,269
- Sean!
- What?

752
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,562
- Sean.
- What?! Yo!

753
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,688
Sean, look.

754
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,442
Oh, shit! Whoa, whoa, shit.

755
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,919
It looks like a sobriety checkpoint.

756
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,880
- Oh, uh, uh...
- You are just throwing shit.

757
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,530
- I'm sorry. I'm-I'm... Yeah.
- How dr...

758
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,240
Dude, how drunk are you?

759
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,201
I ain't really drunk, like, at all.

760
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,827
I'm good.

761
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,290
I'm high as a giraffe ass, though,
I ain't gonna lie.

762
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,750
I'm pretty up there.

763
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,210
Then why are you driving?

764
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,961
I drive high all the time, bitch.

765
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,356
- Shut up.
- Okay, pull over. Pull o...

766
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,607
- For what? For what?
- I'll drive.

767
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,233
- I'll drive because you're high as a kite.
- All right. Okay.

768
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,902
<i>- Or high as a giraffe's ass, as you say.
- Okay, okay, okay.</i>

769
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,552
<i>Hey, hey. Okay. Okay.</i>

770
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,887
<i>Shit.</i>

771
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,740
<i>It's gonna take us even longer now.</i>

772
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:54,848
<i>Just pull...</i>

773
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,934
<i>All right, okay, okay. Goddamn.</i>

774
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,478
You always make the biggest
fucking thing out of nothing.

775
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,321
This is Omicron, right?

776
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:12,533
Which is, if I may point out,

777
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,619
much closer than the hospital.

778
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:17,079
Okay, look, look, look.

779
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,247
We can hide over there.

780
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,915
See?

781
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,917
That little dark area?

782
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,087
And then just tell somebody,
they can help her, right?

783
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,256
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Goldie?

784
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,692
I would love that, Sean.

785
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:29,859
That's such a great fucking idea.

786
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,885
Oh, my God, you're a genius.

787
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,329
She-she opened her eyes. I mean...

788
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,723
- Opened her fucking eyes.
- Mm-mm. No.

789
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,225
No, no, no, no.

790
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,893
No, we're not just going to dump her

791
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,104
somewhere that's...
Look, that's not right.

792
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,064
It's-it's... We're not dumping her, okay?

793
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,191
We're just returning her
from whence she came.

794
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,860
That's it.

795
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,987
Somebody gonna find her,
get her some help.

796
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,197
Then we can leave, go save your little

797
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,551
fucking babies or whatever
the fuck you want to call them,

798
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,785
and then get on with our lives, Kunle.

799
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,789
Okay.

800
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,207
- Stealth mission is a go.
- Okay.

801
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,959
One of us has to go over there

802
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,003
and-and act like a lookout,

803
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,897
make sure that no one interferes
with the plan.

804
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,132
Mm, yeah. Kunle, go see if it's clear.

805
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,653
Okay, okay. Let-let's get in position.

806
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,030
I see him. That's it.

807
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,115
Omicron!

808
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,457
Oh, oh, oh.

809
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,140
- Abort. Abort, abort, abort, abort, abort.
- Shit. What the fuck?

810
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,128
How's it going?

811
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,089
Yes.

812
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,424
Come on.

813
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,970
Shit.

814
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,722
Hey!

815
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,642
Hey, they're pissing on our sacred totem!

816
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,143
What the fuck?

817
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,205
These Gamma Tau bitches
keep pissing on our totem, bro.

818
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,814
Gamma Tau!

819
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,148
Oh, yeah? Hey!

820
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,525
Oh, yeah, you fucking pussy!

821
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,652
- Oh, yeah, you fucking run!
- Oh, shit.

822
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,962
Oh, shit.

823
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,404
Sean! Carlos!

824
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,782
- Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Okay. The fuck!

825
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,022
Go fuck yourself!
- Get out of here!

826
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,524
Whoa! Hey!

827
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,192
Hey, mother fuck...

828
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,260
Fuck you, bitch!
- Fuck you!

829
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,637
Go fuck yourself, bitch!

830
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,013
What the fuck happened?

831
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,491
Why are they throwing shit at my van?

832
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,892
'Cause they…
they thought I was from Gamma Tau.

833
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,436
Racist fuckers.

834
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,438
I don't know if it was racism.

835
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,023
There was this... this dude...

836
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,709
Shut up. Shut up.
Wh-What are you talking about?

837
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,235
Just...

838
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,879
All right, all right, just...
right here, like that.

839
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,322
All right? Like Professor X.

840
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,533
Great. Um...

841
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,953
Want some orange sports drink?

842
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,789
It has no fruit juice,
and it's only 80 calories.

843
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,291
Come on, drink up.

844
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,601
Look, I told you that was a bad idea.

845
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,186
We should've just gone
straight to the hospital.

846
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,879
You know what, pull over. I'll drive.

847
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,565
- There you go.
- You don't even have a fucking seat belt on!

848
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,900
- No, no, no. Hmm. -
- SEAN: Man, I never got a seat belt on!

849
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,360
- Let's just get through this. Calm down.
- No, no.

850
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,903
- Pull over, Sean. Pull over.
- Calm-calm the fuck down.

851
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,971
What you gonna do?

852
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,682
- Nothing. Exactly.
- Sean, pull over.

853
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,018
Shut your dumb ass up.
You ain't gonna do nothing.

854
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,477
- Sean.
- I need to pee.

855
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,770
Pull over.

856
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,565
- I should drive.
- Guys? Guys, uh...

857
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:35,235
I believe Goldilocks needs to urinate.

858
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,655
Um, she better not pee
in my motherfucking van.

859
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,592
I don't know if she's gonna
be able to hold it. Maybe...

860
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:43,660
- She better not pee in my car.
- Maybe you should pull over.

861
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,871
I got it. I got it, Kunle.

862
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,377
Get her out my van. Get her out my van.

863
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,090
All right.

864
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:01,428
Yeah.

865
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,555
Uh, how about that?
You-you pee right here?

866
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,641
- There you go.
- This is good.

867
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,686
- We looked everywhere.
- No, Maddy,

868
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,979
we have not looked everywhere.

869
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,749
And what are you gonna do,
call the cops right now?

870
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:14,107
We are underage.

871
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,960
Does she have, like,
a Find My Friends or something?

872
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,653
We can... we can track her on your phone.

873
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,488
I don't know. I haven't tried that.

874
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,491
There she is.

875
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,494
Wait. That's literally like
a couple blocks from here.

876
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,555
- What the fuck?
- Okay, okay, maybe she just got lost,

877
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,997
so we can go get her.

878
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,874
And I could go with you guys if you want.

879
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,560
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You don't have to do that.

880
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,420
Nah, nah, I mean, like, I-I want to.

881
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,675
Also, if you go a little further,

882
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,970
this neighborhood's, like,
kind of sketchy.

883
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,348
Hold this.

884
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,062
I am so sorry.

885
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,439
It's all good.

886
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,194
I'm so fucked.

887
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:03,365
- I'm so fucked.
- Can't you just...

888
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,366
grow more bacteria?

889
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,909
No.

890
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:08,245
No, no, I...

891
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,288
I mean, you already got into Princeton.

892
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,707
Can they un-admit you?

893
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,709
Yes, yes, they can.

894
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,671
Hey, can you just, like,
not mention Princeton?

895
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,173
Or just around Sean, please.

896
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,343
Wait, I mean, you mean you haven't
already told him?

897
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:24,696
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- I mean,

898
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,155
he-he thinks you're
living together next year.

899
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,824
Okay, okay, well, maybe
he shouldn't just assume that.

900
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:31,852
Yeah, yeah, but it's rather uncouth
to just let him go and keep assuming.

901
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,107
No, you're right, you're right.

902
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,510
Whoo. Yeah, you did it. Whoo, yes.

903
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,638
Whoa. Whoo.

904
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,522
- Come on.
- Can y'all please hurry up?

905
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,768
- This fucking lady watching us.
- What lady?

906
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,397
Hmm-mm.

907
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,607
Get up.

908
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,150
- I'm driving.
- What?

909
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,861
You're paranoid... because you're high.

910
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,988
Which is exactly why
you shouldn't be driving.

911
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,949
Okay. Whatever. Okay.

912
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,719
I ain't gonna worry about anything, am I?

913
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,369
Yeah.

914
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,125
Hey, um, the taillight's busted.

915
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,710
What?

916
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,174
- We gonna die.
- No, we are...

917
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:45,509
- No. What?
- We gonna die, bro.

918
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,153
- Hey. No, no, no, no.
- Oh, we gonna die tonight.

919
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,696
Don't do this. Don't do this.
Please don't do this right...

920
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,822
We gonna die. We gonna die, Kunle.

921
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,157
We get pulled over, we die, Kunle.

922
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,058
- Look...
- We call the police, we die, Kunle.

923
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,869
- Okay, look, Sean, Sean, Sean.
- We breathe the wrong way,

924
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,204
- we die, Kunle.
- Okay, look, Sean.

925
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,605
This isn't good,
but panicking does not help.

926
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,358
Calm down. Look, hey, man,
look at me. Look at me.

927
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,693
- Okay.
- Think about it statistically.

928
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,821
How many people actually
get shot by the cops?

929
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,657
It's, like, really,
really unlikely, right?

930
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,575
- A lot, Kunle.
- No, no, no.

931
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,637
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- No, no, no, no, no.

932
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,204
No, it's really, really unlikely.

933
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,516
I mean, do you know anyone
who's actually been shot by the police?

934
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,542
- I don't know anybody. -CARLOS: No.
- Yes.

935
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,835
My cousin.

936
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,628
Geez, man. I'm sorry.

937
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,505
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Is he...?

938
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,566
He wasn't doing anything...
Just minding his business,

939
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,509
hanging with a friend,
playing <i>Call of Duty.</i>

940
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,428
And they just showed up
for-for... for no reason?

941
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,306
Well, his friend was trapping
a little bit.

942
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,076
- His friend was trapping a little bit.
- God.

943
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,810
The cops came in,

944
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,562
kicked the gor... door down.

945
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,357
I mean, they say he scared 'em,
and they shot him, all right?

946
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,776
Shot him right in his ass, man.

947
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,954
Oh, you motherfuckers
are some assholes.

948
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,165
That's not funny.

949
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,250
He got to wear a colostomy bag now.

950
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,837
- Oh.
- You ever boo-boo in a bag?

951
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,505
No.

952
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,275
He might've did some fucked-up shit,
but that don't mean

953
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,693
that he deserved that.
Like, come on, y'all.

954
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,093
- Okay, no, he didn't,
-Guys.

955
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,137
- But what do you want to do?
- Guys.

956
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,680
Incoming.

957
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,682
Hey, we can see
what you're doing out here,

958
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,368
and we don't tolerate that
in this neighborhood.

959
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,560
We saw you.

960
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,020
You need to get out of here.

961
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,873
And you don't need to be selling drugs.

962
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,041
- We're leaving. -Get out.
- Look, look, look.

963
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,585
- We're-we're not doing anything wrong.
- Please get your phone out of my face.

964
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,378
- We just had some car issues.
- I said get out.

965
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,842
We already put your picture up

966
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,214
on the Good Neighbor app.

967
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,365
- They're leaving.
- Yeah, let 'em go.

968
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,119
Come on.

969
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,663
- I got… I got it all.
- Yeah.

970
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,624
<i>Her pin's moving again.</i>

971
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,673
It looks like she's in that car.

972
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,137
She seriously thought
we were drug dealers.

973
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:56,056
What if she called the cops?

974
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,299
What if we get pulled over?
What if we get pulled over?

975
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,684
What if we get pulled over?

976
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,937
Sean, what do we do?

977
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,773
Look, Terence got an extra car
that we can use, okay?

978
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,192
He live around the corner. It's not far.

979
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,236
Are you sure there's just not just, like,

980
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:10,904
one other, like... maybe your aunt.

981
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,114
We can go to your aunt's house.

982
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,200
Just make this left up here. Don't be...

983
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,244
Don't be fucking nervous.

984
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,957
He's the closest?

985
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,054
No, no, no. Hey, hey.
You stay here with her.

986
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,555
Come on, Kunle.

987
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,603
It...

988
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:46,690
It's all spinning.

989
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,528
Here. Here.

990
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,197
Hydrate or die-drate.

991
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,080
All right, there you go.

992
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,708
Go, go, go, go.

993
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,544
- What's up?
- Oh.

994
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:08,962
Baby Sean.

995
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,130
What are you doing here?

996
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,881
I need to see my brother.

997
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,467
- Uh, he's up in here somewhere.
- Yeah.

998
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,671
- Hey, who's your friend?
- That's Kunle.

999
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,097
Hey, I'ma be back. Try to go find Terence.

1000
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,016
- Okay. You want me...
- Stay here.

1001
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,476
You want me to st... I'll stay here.

1002
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:25,979
Malik, bro.

1003
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,106
Oh, uh, Kun-Kunle.

1004
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,774
Kunle.

1005
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,193
So, Baby Sean's friend from school?

1006
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,071
Yes, yes, we're, uh, we're roommates.

1007
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:36,823
You all call him Baby Sean?

1008
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,241
Hell yeah.

1009
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,035
Old baby face having ass.

1010
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,663
Yo, sit your butt down, bro.

1011
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,000
For real, sit down.

1012
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,337
- Sit down!
- Sit your ass down, man. Damn.

1013
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,255
Here you go, bro. Relax.

1014
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,799
Smoke?

1015
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,725
- You're in college, bro.
- No. No, thank you.

1016
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:59,763
You look like you could use a smoke.

1017
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,806
I'm-I'm okay.

1018
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,019
Where's, uh...

1019
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,021
Where-where's... where's your restroom?

1020
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,775
Come on, T. Please, man.

1021
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,860
It's an emergency, all right?

1022
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,114
Kunle's grandmother, man,
she's on her deathbed.

1023
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:21,659
You ain't driving my car, nigga.

1024
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:23,578
Look, Kunle gonna drive.

1025
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:25,997
Please, T.

1026
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,506
Where the hell are we?

1027
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,926
This is, like... this is the hood, guys.

1028
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,369
Hey, Maddy, could you just,
like, pedal for a second?

1029
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,365
- I'm getting really tired.
- No, no, I can't.

1030
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,932
My knees are super bad.

1031
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,184
Plus, we're super close.

1032
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,395
Hey. Can you, uh...

1033
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,480
Can you tell me your name?

1034
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,399
I'm Carlos.

1035
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,734
What's... what's your name?

1036
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,194
E-Emma.

1037
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,946
Emma?

1038
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,740
I just... I-I need... I need you
to stay awake for me.

1039
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:03,076
Can you... can you do that?

1040
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,330
- Want some granola?
- No.

1041
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,916
No? Okay, that's-that's fine.

1042
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:13,044
Um, uh, what's your major?

1043
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,673
I'm a mechanical aerospace engineer,

1044
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:20,051
aka, uh, um, a rocket scientist.

1045
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,553
You know, the-the...

1046
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,097
Serious. Hey.

1047
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,391
Hey, hey, hey.

1048
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,851
Stay awake.

1049
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,188
You like, uh... you like outer space?

1050
00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:34,315
Rockets?

1051
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,318
Stuff like that?

1052
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:42,282
It's always been a-a dream of mine
to go to Mars someday.

1053
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,367
Would you like to go to Mars?

1054
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,913
Emma?

1055
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,125
Emma, um...

1056
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,669
what year are you?

1057
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,297
In school... what-what year are you?

1058
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,050
Twelfth-th...

1059
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,762
Tw-Twelfth.

1060
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,059
Twelfth?

1061
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,438
Wait, y-you... y-you mean like...

1062
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,441
like you're in high school?

1063
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,529
Uh-oh, shh.

1064
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:23,531
Shh.

1065
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:27,744
My sister, she told me not to say.

1066
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:32,707
She hates me.

1067
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,502
- She…
- CARLOS: No, no, no.

1068
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:37,754
She doesn't want
to hang out with me.

1069
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,380
No, no, it's all right.

1070
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:43,760
- It's all right. Uh...
- She hates me.

1071
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,929
Hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1072
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,222
She doesn't hate you.

1073
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,015
She likes you.

1074
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,434
She told me.

1075
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,146
- Sh-She did?
- Yeah.

1076
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,315
Yeah, she told me. Isn't that...

1077
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:01,986
It's-it's all right, okay?

1078
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,905
It's all... it's all good.

1079
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,496
I mean, she doesn't really...

1080
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,957
take me anywhere, ever.

1081
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,751
But it's fine.

1082
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,920
We'll grow out of it,

1083
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:23,049
'cause, like, sisters are forever,
you know?

1084
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,015
Pay you a hundred dollars.

1085
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,937
:
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1086
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,196
Yo, people out here, man!

1087
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,289
I'm sorry.

1088
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,458
Man, was you, like,
hiding in the bathroom?

1089
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,085
No.

1090
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:01,921
No.

1091
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,924
- What? What? No.
- Okay. Okay. Okay, look.

1092
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,593
Oh, shit. Yeah, nice.

1093
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,386
Guys?

1094
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,680
You guys?

1095
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,682
Yo, what are you doing out of the van?

1096
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,851
Get back outside.

1097
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,186
- She was drinking this.
- Oh.

1098
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,688
Oh, shit, that is...

1099
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,608
- Death punch.
- Death punch?

1100
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,776
Why is it called death punch?

1101
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,212
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. Oh, God.

1102
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,404
Whoa!

1103
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,369
Hey, hey, Terence. Sorry.

1104
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,372
What the hell is going on?

1105
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:38,374
Oh, uh, okay, so-so-so...

1106
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,710
we found this girl,
and we don't know who she is.

1107
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,296
Actually, actually, her name's Emma,

1108
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:46,049
- and she just told me that she's in high school.
- Shit!

1109
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,509
- What?
- What the fuck?!

1110
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,261
Nope!

1111
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:51,471
No! Hell no!

1112
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:52,823
- Nope, nope, nope.
- Get the weed, nigga!

1113
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,807
- Grab the weed, nigga!
- Hell no.

1114
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,187
- That's shit right there.
- Come on.

1115
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,688
She not gonna get me hung.

1116
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:02,732
Here. Oh, God. Okay.

1117
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,818
So y'all found a passed-out,

1118
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:09,864
possibly roofied white child
in your house,

1119
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,741
got her even drunker,

1120
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,619
and you thought it'd be a good idea
to bring her to my house?

1121
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:18,623
Sean, you know I'm on parole,
and you lied to me.

1122
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:22,085
Kunle, is your grandma even dying?

1123
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:27,048
I'm sorry. We just tried to help her.

1124
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,341
Give me my keys.

1125
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:30,843
Give 'em to me!

1126
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:32,404
We got to actually go to the hospital.

1127
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,906
- Man, Kunle…
- TERENCE: Not in my car, you don't.

1128
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,473
- Here. Just take 'em.
- Yo, ey.

1129
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,017
- What you doing?
- Look, we don't have time to argue, Sean.

1130
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,311
We got to go now. Come on, Carlos.

1131
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:41,729
You can't go with them.

1132
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,731
Have you lost your damn mind?

1133
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:46,317
If something happens to that girl,
they'll be fine.

1134
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,903
Even if they get caught,
they'll be fine probably.

1135
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,863
You won't be.

1136
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,073
Isn't Kunle rich?

1137
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,717
Ain't his family fucking dentists
or some shit?

1138
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,159
Sean?

1139
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,537
Sean.

1140
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,914
Let them handle it.

1141
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,589
Wait, guys.
Guys, it says she's somewhere here.

1142
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:09,716
- Look.
- Huh?

1143
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,926
Which house is it? I can't tell.

1144
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,181
You know what?

1145
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:18,558
You two stay here.

1146
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,309
I'm gonna go check it out.

1147
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:21,936
Excuse me.

1148
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,563
Can I help you?

1149
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,565
Are y'all lost?

1150
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,151
No, no, we're good.

1151
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,569
We're good. Um...

1152
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,863
Thank you. Have a good night.

1153
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,157
Girl, there's a white boy out here
with a sheet on.

1154
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,535
What?

1155
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:39,263
- I'm not driving until you put your seat belt on.
- Emma!

1156
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:41,223
Okay, I'm putting-I'm putting
my seat belt… I'm putting my seat belt on.

1157
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,641
- I need to hear it click. I need to hear it click.
- "I need to hear it click"?

1158
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,101
- Wow. You heard the fucking click?
- Emma!

1159
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,269
Thank you. And now we're off.

1160
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,336
Emma! Emma!

1161
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:49,714
Emma!

1162
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,884
Emma!

1163
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,724
<i>We can take the back roads,</i>

1164
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,559
<i>through the woods.</i>

1165
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,352
<i>It's a bit longer, but...</i>

1166
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:05,414
nobody goes that way,
and we probably won't get pulled over.

1167
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:07,857
- "Probably"?
- We need to get her to the hospital now.

1168
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,901
Shit, at this point,

1169
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,754
we just gonna have to speed run
the fucking tour.

1170
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:13,922
- Hey, good shit. -Okay.
- I'm sorry, did you want to drive?

1171
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,282
Oh, wait, you can't,
because you've literally

1172
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,951
been drinking and smoking pot
since 3:00 p.m.

1173
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:21,078
Yes, I have.

1174
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,580
Apologies.

1175
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:25,541
I should've just assumed
this highly unlikely situation

1176
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,084
would've just fucking happened.

1177
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,544
Guys, guys, okay.

1178
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,338
Can we just take a calming breath

1179
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,508
and remember that we're all
on the same team here?

1180
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,301
Anybody want a granola bar?

1181
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:40,598
Carlos, please,
stop with the fucking granola bars, okay?

1182
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,935
Don't nobody want
no fucking granola bar, Carlos.

1183
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,895
I just want to get this over with.

1184
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,147
Just want to make sure
we didn't kill this girl,

1185
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:52,235
save my cultures and...
just go the fuck to sleep.

1186
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,987
And the Legendary Tour?

1187
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,114
I'm mean...

1188
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:59,617
I've still got energy.

1189
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,702
You two should just go without me.

1190
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,789
I'm not really in the mood anymore.

1191
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,668
Can you make sure she's okay, please?

1192
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,253
On it.

1193
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,713
Yeah, I think that was
the license plate. I don't...

1194
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,477
So your sister got in a car

1195
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,827
with three Black or Latino men
that you didn't recognize...

1196
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,011
What do you... what do you mean?
What do you mean?

1197
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:22,139
You said one of them opened the door
and she climbed in the car.

1198
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,023
Do you have reason to believe
she was coerced?

1199
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,285
Are you fucking kidding me?

1200
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,770
Why... why would she get in a random car

1201
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,064
with three fucking guys
that she doesn't even know?

1202
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,693
- She's 17.
- Ma'am, I'm just trying to understand your emergency.

1203
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,587
Oh, uh, actually,
it feels like you're trying to say

1204
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,655
that I'm racist or something,
and I'm really not,

1205
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,675
- so I don't really know what you're trying to do.
- Maddy...

1206
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,033
My sister needs help.

1207
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,535
Are you intoxicated, ma'am?

1208
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,763
How does that... How does...
Wait, how does that matter?

1209
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,265
- How does that even matter?
- Okay, Maddy, give me the...

1210
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:48,624
- I saw what I saw!
- Maddy. Hi. I'm so sorry.

1211
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,894
- My-my friend is just a little bit upset
-Give me the phone. Give me it.

1212
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,920
- Because it's her sister.
- Uh-huh.

1213
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:55,339
Is there any way we could do,
like, a welfare check?

1214
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,842
We're tracking her phone,
so we have her current location.

1215
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,612
Sure. We'll send our
next available officer to check it out.

1216
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,356
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- What the fuck?

1217
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,898
Is she still alive?

1218
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:56,275
Hey.

1219
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,611
Still alive?

1220
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,404
Yeah. Yeah.

1221
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,989
She's still alive.

1222
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,368
Uh-oh.

1223
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:14,543
Where are we?

1224
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,004
Here. Drink this.

1225
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,923
Drink this. Come on.

1226
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,549
Who are you?

1227
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:22,343
Hey. Hey.

1228
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,863
- W-W-W-Wait, wait. It's all right. Guys?
- What's going… What is going on?

1229
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,305
Where the fuck are we?

1230
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:28,033
- Okay, okay, hold on, hold on.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1231
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:30,285
- Where are you taking me?
- It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

1232
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,995
Hey, calm down.
- Oh, shit.

1233
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,830
- Please get her under control.
- What the fuck you want me to do?

1234
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,454
- Hey! Hey!
- Just get her under control.

1235
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,068
Stop! Oh!

1236
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,445
Shit.

1237
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,493
Oh...

1238
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,036
- Fuck!
- Okay.

1239
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,833
Hey. Wait, wait, wait.

1240
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,127
Oh, sh...
- Ow.

1241
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,930
Ow, ow. Hey, hey.

1242
00:54:58,004 --> 00:55:00,006
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, come back!

1243
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:01,566
- No, Carlos.
- All right, guys, I'll go get her.

1244
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,134
Fuck! Fuck.

1245
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,195
- Look. My wipers.
- Emma, wait!

1246
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,429
Come back!

1247
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,407
- They crashed my fucking van.
- Where's he gone?

1248
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:10,075
- Emma!
- We're just trying to help you!

1249
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,434
Everything's good.

1250
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:16,272
- Fuck.
- My van.

1251
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,399
- Come on.
- Coming.

1252
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,751
- Okay.
- Yep, there's...

1253
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:22,028
- Ow.
- She's really fast.

1254
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,033
Goldilocks!

1255
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,661
- Oh! Whoa.
- Ooh, shit.

1256
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,097
- What?
- Carlos, your fucking nose.

1257
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,706
Are you okay?

1258
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,082
Oh. Oh.

1259
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,043
Oh, you're doing a good job.

1260
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:39,045
- Oh. Oh, that's...
- Good job.

1261
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:40,796
- That's blood.
- Yes, it's blood.

1262
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,882
Are you okay?
You got to say something to me.

1263
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:44,425
- How do I look?
- N-Not good.

1264
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:45,760
Aw, you got the nose boo-boo.

1265
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,219
I think she went this way.

1266
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:49,430
We don't know where the white girl is.

1267
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:52,099
Come on, come on, come on. Let's find her.

1268
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,602
Come on, Kunle.

1269
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,816
- Goldilocks!
- Emma!

1270
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,943
Where are you? Please, come back!

1271
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:04,320
Emma!

1272
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,031
We trying to help you, white girl.

1273
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,034
They haven't moved?

1274
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,869
No, they're just standing there.

1275
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,081
Can you guys ride any faster?

1276
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:16,415
Maddy, we're trying.

1277
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:18,042
Just...

1278
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,770
You sure you don't want me
to switch with you, Alice?

1279
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:21,712
This thing really isn't that hard to ride.

1280
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,315
- I think you'd probably get it.
- Why aren't they moving?

1281
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:24,757
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1282
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,259
Okay, actually, yeah,
that might be a really good idea.

1283
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:28,677
Guys, we can't stop.

1284
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:30,238
- Maddy, just one second.
- What are you doing?

1285
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,388
We can't stop.

1286
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,310
What?

1287
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,455
You know, Alice has been
driving you around all night.

1288
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:39,688
You could, I don't know,

1289
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,083
- be grateful.
- Rafael, it's all right.

1290
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:42,793
- Excuse me?
- No, no, no. No, you're awesome.

1291
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:44,127
- First of all, no.
- And you're cool.

1292
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,754
- You don't even know me.
- And you deserve better than this.

1293
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:48,006
- Yeah, she's great. Are you for real?
- I'm just saying.

1294
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,323
You don't even fucking know me.

1295
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,842
You don't get to be all white knight

1296
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,511
- and be offended on her behalf.
- Oh, "white knight," yeah.

1297
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:54,829
I'm freaking out
because my sister has been taken

1298
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,331
and that 911 lady was a total bitch to me
on the phone.

1299
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,142
But you know, you know,
you could just not be actively mean.

1300
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,061
- I'm sorry! I'm having a hard night!
- We're here, all right?

1301
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,336
And we're here for you, Maddy.

1302
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,712
We're fucking here.

1303
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:05,756
You brought a high schooler
to a fraternity party

1304
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,234
and then neglected her for two hours.

1305
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:08,425
We're fucking here.

1306
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:10,229
So get on the goddamn bike,
and we're going.

1307
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,242
I think you should get on the bike.

1308
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:16,725
Yeah, I'm getting on the bike.

1309
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,480
Ow.

1310
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:26,986
Trail ends here.

1311
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:31,157
All right, shit, it must mean
she around here somewhere.

1312
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,200
Uh, or...

1313
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:35,119
she backtracked.

1314
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,329
Or-or maybe...

1315
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:39,415
No offense... you're in no way qualified

1316
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:40,875
to track people through the woods.

1317
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,334
- I'm an Eagle Scout.
- Okay.

1318
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,919
I was trained in tracking animals.

1319
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,713
Okay, but this isn't Boy Scouts,
all right?

1320
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,549
- It's not...
- This isn't a video game. This is real life.

1321
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:52,887
And we... we can't just reload
if you're wrong, Carlos.

1322
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,364
And I'm sorry, but I don't see anything.

1323
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,639
Do you see anything?

1324
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,892
Sean, you see anything?
Uh, no, there's nothing.

1325
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,351
All right, I'm...

1326
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:01,454
Just breathe, my nigga. Damn.

1327
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,522
- Okay.
- What if she dies out here?

1328
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:05,649
Huh? Why did I listen to you?

1329
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,943
This is so fucking stupid.

1330
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:09,570
This is so stupid.

1331
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,614
I told you we should just call 911,

1332
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,865
but you wouldn't let me.

1333
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,491
You just wouldn't let me call.

1334
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:15,826
Now look at us.

1335
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,411
Wouldn't let you call?

1336
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,663
What the fuck am I,
your third-grade teacher?

1337
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,248
You decided not to call.

1338
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,500
We all decided to not call.

1339
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,213
He didn't force you not to call.

1340
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:28,380
Seriously?

1341
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:30,024
If you called, it would be on you,

1342
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,760
and you didn't want it to be on you
because you knew I was right.

1343
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,178
Also because you're a pussy.

1344
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,763
- What?
- I'm-I'm a pussy?

1345
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,015
- Yeah.
- I'm a pussy, but you've been afraid

1346
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,160
- of everything this whole night?
- Guys, guys.

1347
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,953
- I'm a pussy?
- Can we not call each other pussies?

1348
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,646
It's kind of sexist.

1349
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,981
A vagina is strong enough
to give birth to a child.

1350
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:48,359
I mean, I think the word
that you're looking for

1351
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,903
is-is "coward" or-or, ironically enough,

1352
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,529
- "wiener."
- Yeah.

1353
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:56,116
Mm-hmm. Don't be such a sexist
coward wiener, Sean.

1354
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,868
I can't believe you just said that

1355
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:00,013
- out your mouth, first of all.
- Yeah. Sexist coward wiener.

1356
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,265
- You, all of that.
- Okay, well, don't be such a little bitch, Kunle.

1357
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,332
- I'm a bitch?
- Yeah.

1358
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:04,768
- That's also arguably sexist.
- Okay. -Yeah.

1359
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:05,793
Calm down.

1360
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,229
- If you got something to say, just say it.
- Look, okay.

1361
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:11,131
You were around real Black men
for like two fucking minutes tonight,

1362
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,651
and you went and hid in the bathroom.

1363
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:14,677
- Who was hiding? I was hiding?
- You! It's okay.

1364
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,655
- I wasn't hiding. I wasn't hiding.
- I love you still.

1365
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,281
- Oh, wow.
- Okay, all right, no, we can do this.

1366
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,741
What the fuck do you want me to say?

1367
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:22,101
What, I'm so sorry
that my parents are doctors?

1368
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,270
Oh, shit, you know what?
I'm even more sorry

1369
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:26,272
- that my childhood was happy.
- Ow.

1370
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,898
You know what?

1371
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:31,026
You don't have the authority
to revoke my Blackness, dickhead.

1372
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,587
Guys, can we... can we please just...

1373
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,113
No, no, no. Let him continue.

1374
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,796
- Kunle angry.
- You know what?

1375
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:39,660
I think it is hilarious
that you think that you are so wise.

1376
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,496
Like you got some kind of street smarts.
Why?

1377
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,915
Oh, why, Sean?
Because you know where to buy acid?

1378
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:46,834
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, Carlos.

1379
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,752
Guess what.
This dude's tried drugs before.

1380
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,504
- I know.
- Whoo, yeah!

1381
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,867
Round of applause, motherfucker.

1382
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,173
You tried drugs.

1383
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,341
But you know what?

1384
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:55,843
Who the fuck cares?

1385
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,678
You know what, Sean?

1386
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,930
The last time I checked,
getting fucked-up all the time

1387
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,932
doesn't mean you know a goddamn thing.

1388
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,642
It just makes you fucked-up.

1389
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:08,897
Okay.

1390
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,411
- I like this Kunle.
- Yeah, I'm glad you do.

1391
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,946
This Kunle is nice.

1392
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,882
- That's good. You showing nuts now.
- Fuck this.

1393
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,867
Look, I feel like it's the first time
he ever used

1394
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,303
his Black skin tone type of thing.

1395
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:22,929
- This is great. I like this.
- You know what?

1396
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,389
Nah, I'm sorry, that was just really good.

1397
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,682
Look, just chill out, all right?
Chill out.

1398
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:27,017
- No, I'm gonna... I'm call...
- Give me the fucking phone.

1399
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,625
Carlos, give me your phone.

1400
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,003
- Give me your phone.
- Just chill out, Carlos.

1401
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,880
- Give it to me now!
- Come on.

1402
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,649
- Don't give him your phone.
- Give it to me, Carlos.

1403
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:35,799
Don't... Calm down.

1404
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,319
We don't got time for this, Kunle.
Chill out.

1405
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,261
- No, we lost her!
- The girl, we... Ooh.

1406
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:42,431
We lost this girl in the fucking forest
because of you!

1407
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:43,515
You!

1408
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,810
- Fuck!
- Ouch. Nice.

1409
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:48,788
- Give me this fucking...
- Hey, hey. -Get your ass...

1410
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,230
See?

1411
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,416
- Fuck! -SEAN: Kunle.
- Guys, guys.

1412
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,792
- Can we please stop fighting?
- Asshole!

1413
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,027
It doesn't accomplish anything.

1414
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,071
- Come on.
- All right, look.

1415
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,090
Let's take it to a vote
since this dickhead right here

1416
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,617
- wants to go all at. Right?
- Ow.

1417
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,579
All in favor of calling the police,
raise your hand.

1418
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:08,791
Yeah, how you feel?

1419
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,584
I feel so good.

1420
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,669
I feel really good, Kunle.

1421
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:22,888
Yeah, you're both cowards.

1422
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,516
We're both cowards.

1423
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,601
Get off of me, Carlos!

1424
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,395
Don't be mad at him.

1425
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:42,866
Found her.

1426
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,078
How the fuck she get in a tree?

1427
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:52,251
Someday this will all just be
a crazy story, you know?

1428
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:56,296
Remember when we tried
to sneak into Underground?

1429
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,132
Freshman year.

1430
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,404
Yeah, and you got stuck in the window

1431
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:04,197
- like fucking Winnie-the-Pooh.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1432
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,806
That's what you said back then.

1433
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,308
And-and, um,
then we went back to your room,

1434
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:13,564
and we just watched 1970s Winnie-the-Pooh
compilation videos on YouTube.

1435
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:20,154
You know, I-I feel like that's the night
that we became friends.

1436
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:23,699
Like, this is kind of our friend-versary.

1437
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,701
We've come full circle.

1438
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,870
So, we all just get to go to Underground.

1439
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,371
Finally, right?

1440
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:30,998
And-and just in time.

1441
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,083
Because this is our last chance.

1442
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,546
So you got to come, man.

1443
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,132
Don't be a party pooper. Come on.

1444
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,509
I'm tired.

1445
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:44,761
But, y-you know, you should go.

1446
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,558
Fuck him. L-Let him be a party pooper.

1447
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,685
Come on, Kunle.

1448
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,645
I can't go.

1449
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:55,105
If I go, you can't go.

1450
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,065
Because Sean only got two passes.

1451
01:02:57,149 --> 01:03:00,486
Sean only got passes for himself plus one.

1452
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,780
So you should go.

1453
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:07,159
Bitch-ass shit.

1454
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,162
Los, I just didn't think you'd want to go.

1455
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,580
That was it.

1456
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:13,624
No, I-I, um...

1457
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,435
For real, I really did think
that you was just

1458
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,299
- gonna be playing games tonight, man.
- I was.

1459
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,466
I was. Yes, so it's... it's fine.

1460
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:25,052
Los.

1461
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,971
- Los.
- That's...

1462
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,598
That's fine. Yeah.

1463
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,653
Whoa, whoa, guys, look.

1464
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:53,956
Come on.

1465
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:02,339
Call 911 again.

1466
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,484
- I think we should call 911.
- Okay, I'll do it.

1467
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,386
911. What is the nature of your emergency?

1468
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,471
- Yes, hi. It's us again.
- Oh.

1469
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:11,306
We called about the girl in the van.

1470
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,351
Well, we're, like,
hiding and-and-and looking at them,

1471
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,412
and we're pretty sure
that something bad is going on now.

1472
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,772
They've brought her
into the middle of the woods.

1473
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,066
She looks unconscious.

1474
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:24,945
What's wrong with you?

1475
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,089
Okay, don't ask me what's wrong with me.

1476
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:27,155
What's wrong with you?

1477
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,919
- I ain't fuck up nobody's moment.
- Okay, well, look, this whole...

1478
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:42,129
All you've been worried about
is this Legendary Tour.

1479
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:44,590
Partying should not be your priority.

1480
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:47,551
School is almost over, and
you don't have anything to show for it.

1481
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:50,721
Sean, you are way too smart
to not have a plan.

1482
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:54,975
What is your location?

1483
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,393
Where even are we?

1484
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,604
Um, we're on, uh, Highland, Highland Road.

1485
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:00,164
- Ma'am?
- All right, do you know... Maddy, what...

1486
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,708
No, I need to make sure she's okay.

1487
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:03,892
- Madeline…, get your ass back here right now!
- Ma'am.

1488
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:10,324
I don't feel like listening
to these lectures all the time, man.

1489
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,576
Like, damn.
Like, maybe we don't need to live together

1490
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,785
next year, to be honest.

1491
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:15,495
Hmm.

1492
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,957
You know what?

1493
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:22,294
I think this is a really good time
to tell you that, um,

1494
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:24,504
I got into Princeton.

1495
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,885
So yeah, we're not gonna be
living together next year.

1496
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,931
Good job!

1497
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:38,060
Princeton. Good, good, Kunle.

1498
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,478
You did it.

1499
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,313
You know what, fuck you and Princeton.

1500
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,814
How 'bout them apples?

1501
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,274
Yeah, that's really mature.

1502
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:46,193
Oh, your little culture thingies...

1503
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,996
- Them bitches might be dead.
- That's nice.

1504
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,547
- Yeah.
- That's very mature.

1505
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:52,131
- Yeah, fuck your kids.
- That's really ma... -

1506
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:54,326
Hey. Oh, hey.

1507
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,845
- Oh, she got a stick.
- Okay, wait.

1508
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,680
- Hey, look, I got this. I got this.
- We, look… we gonna... What? Kunle.

1509
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,223
- Don't-don't...
- You're not a fucking leader.

1510
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,767
- All right, don't fucking do this. I got this.
- All right.

1511
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,167
- You got it.
- Hey.

1512
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,502
- Oh, shit!
- See?

1513
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,021
- Ow, ow, ow!
- You got it. See? See, hey...

1514
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,564
Oh. Um...

1515
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,232
Yeah, they're fighting
with our friend now.

1516
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:10,342
- What do we do?
- Do not engage.

1517
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,222
- Oh, shit.
- Aah! Stop!

1518
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,574
- Stop!
- What did you do to her?!

1519
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:18,016
Who?

1520
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,310
- Emma.
- Who the fuck is Emma?

1521
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:21,913
- Oh, shit. Gold...
- Oh, oh, Emma, Emma.

1522
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,271
The Gold... Goldilocks.

1523
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:25,774
We didn't...
Okay, we are friends of-of Emma.

1524
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,460
- Like, we just met her, and we...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1525
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,628
Oh, shit!

1526
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:29,837
- Fuck, stop! Stop!
- Stop fucking...

1527
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:30,922
Give-give me this motherfucking stick.

1528
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,864
- -Give me the...
- Whoa, oh.

1529
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:34,308
Strong-ass little white girl.

1530
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:35,926
- Are you okay?
- Oh, shit.

1531
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,136
She's got spray.

1532
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,286
Fuck!

1533
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,250
- That's what your... See, karma, karma.
- Oh...

1534
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,432
- Whoa, whoa.
- I know. See? Karma.

1535
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,041
- Ow! Shit!
- Whoa. Hey. -Hah!

1536
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,168
- Fuck! Ow!
- No, are you... are you okay?

1537
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:46,795
Are you... Hey, are you okay?

1538
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,505
- We didn't do anything.
- Shit.

1539
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,608
And then we were trying to make sure
she was okay. That's it.

1540
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:53,343
Hey, hey, look, you need
to rinse your eyes, all right?

1541
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:56,096
You really need
to rinse your eyes. Come on.

1542
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,407
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Step back!

1543
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,057
- Oh, fuck.
- That's right!

1544
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,059
Keep your hands up! Don't move!

1545
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:02,853
We-we helping. We helping, uh, Officer.

1546
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,497
- Get on the ground! Don't move!
- Sir, this is just a big mistake.

1547
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,273
- We haven't done anything wrong.
- Shit.

1548
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,942
- We actually didn't do shit.
- Oh, no.

1549
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,420
We-we're just trying
to take her to the hospital.

1550
01:07:10,444 --> 01:07:11,671
- You're under arrest.
- Fuck. -Fucking police.

1551
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:12,863
You're under arrest.

1552
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,865
- Oh, this burns.
- Don't move!

1553
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:16,628
- Do not! Okay.
- Why does it burn so much?

1554
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:19,053
- What? -KUNLE: Look at her shoes.
- Fuck.

1555
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,829
Oh, my God, they're not cops.

1556
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:22,205
What the fuck? Shiny shit.

1557
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:23,516
What are you doing?
What are you... Look it, look.

1558
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,851
She's got, like, some shiny shoes on.

1559
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,602
- What the fuck?
- Why are you impersonating a police officer?

1560
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,378
- That's so fucking illegal!
- What are...

1561
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,213
Wait, Rafa?

1562
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:32,567
- What are you doing here, dude?
- What are you doing here?

1563
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:35,093
We-we just rolled into a ditch
and-and-and...

1564
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:37,053
We've been looking for her sister, man.

1565
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:38,346
Wait, you know them?

1566
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:39,431
Yeah, that's my cousin.

1567
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,057
Yeah, we're-we're related.

1568
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,893
What the fuck is going on right now?

1569
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,020
- Stay back!
- Bitch, if you spray us,

1570
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,831
- we gonna have an issue.
- Don't fuck with me!

1571
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:49,041
- Stay back!
- Please don't call her a bitch right now.

1572
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,710
- All right, my bad, but chill.
- Okay, okay.

1573
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,069
Can y'all just tell her to chill
so we can calm down?

1574
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:54,237
Please chill.

1575
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:56,031
Okay, but you guys aren't, like,

1576
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,866
- kidnapping that girl, right?
- What?

1577
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,802
- What the fuck, boy?
- No. Why would we kidnap a girl?

1578
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,262
- No, no, no, no, no. We don't even know her.
- I gotta make sure.

1579
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:02,513
- There's a van and a girl, you know?
- Wait, wait, wait.

1580
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,137
Okay, I'm sorry, wait. He's your cousin?

1581
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:05,665
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1582
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:09,002
Uh, you don't look...

1583
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,629
Oh, yeah, um...

1584
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:12,589
He-he looks, like, super white.

1585
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,108
- He gets that all the time.
- Yeah. I'm Mexican.

1586
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,359
Okay, but-but what are you guys
doing here?

1587
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,903
We're trying to take her to the hospital.

1588
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,446
Yeah, -We-we found her, and
she was, she was in our house,

1589
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,906
- and she was unconscious.
- You found her?

1590
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,407
And she started, like,
throwing up everywhere.

1591
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,742
- This is bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

1592
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:23,993
- Hey, look, just...
- Why would I lie to you?

1593
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,644
Just let him explain, all right?

1594
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,354
No! Let me talk to my sister!

1595
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,688
Go ahead.

1596
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:31,525
- Got it? Go. Just... Emma?
- Oh, my God.

1597
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,945
We found your sister like this
passed out on our floor.

1598
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:36,988
Emma! Emma, did they hurt you?

1599
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:38,323
- Did we hurt...
- See?

1600
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,533
- Emma.
- See?

1601
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,093
White girl, Black dudes. What'd I say?

1602
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,953
Dude, how'd you guys even find us?

1603
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,204
Oh.

1604
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,915
Find My Fr...?

1605
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,960
Wait, but sh-she doesn't even
have a cell phone.

1606
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:57,509
- Wow. -Mm.
- Oh, uh...

1607
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,511
We didn't look there.

1608
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,555
Guys, I can't hear anything.

1609
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,139
Okay, well, if she's still breathing,

1610
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,475
then that means
that her heart is still beating.

1611
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:07,370
- Okay, I'm just trying to help.
- You're just trying to help?

1612
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:09,789
- Yes.
- Then why are we in the middle of a fucking forest right now?

1613
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,916
And why did you guys stop
at some weird house on the way here?

1614
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,775
We were trying to avoid
getting pulled over.

1615
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,318
We have a taillight that's out.

1616
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:17,505
And we were trying to get another car
from his brother...

1617
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,990
We know that this sounds weird, bad...

1618
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,259
- The taillight is out.
- Exactly.

1619
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:22,635
- Thank you.
- They're fucking lying.

1620
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,870
What the fuck is your problem?

1621
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:26,353
He just said the taillight was out.

1622
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:28,748
Why are you so damn bent
on making us the bad guy?

1623
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,560
And why the fuck was you so quick
to pepper-spray us?

1624
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,586
Huh? What, 'cause we Black?

1625
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,296
- No! What?
- We scare you that much?

1626
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,131
Maddy, what if there's a chance
that this is

1627
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,966
just one big, weird misunderstanding?

1628
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:39,676
I mean, it-it kind of tracks.

1629
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:40,945
Are you just gonna believe them?

1630
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:42,154
What, are you a fucking idiot?

1631
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,763
No, Maddy, I'm not a fucking idiot.

1632
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,616
- He genuinely looks like he's trying to help.
- Okay, um… Okay, excuse me.

1633
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,725
- Don't touch her!
- Okay.

1634
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:47,994
- Oh, God.
- He's certified to help.

1635
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,311
He-he's certified.

1636
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,872
How much has she drank tonight?

1637
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:52,272
- I don't fucking know.
- Okay.

1638
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,858
Well, she seems to be getting drunker
and-and-and...

1639
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,818
I don't know, she threw up a lot earlier,

1640
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:58,629
but I-I don't know
if that's gonna be enough.

1641
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:00,047
She's gonna be okay, though, right?

1642
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:01,948
She's not gonna, like, die, right?

1643
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,950
Hey, when did you call 911?

1644
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,452
Like ten minutes ago.

1645
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,513
They're sort of having trouble
figuring out where we are.

1646
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,081
Guys, she's getting colder.

1647
01:10:10,165 --> 01:10:11,791
Oh. Hey, we-we need...

1648
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,294
We need to get her
to the hospital, like, now.

1649
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,462
I got a better idea.

1650
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,632
How about we get the fuck out of here?

1651
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,425
Okay? Help is already on the way.

1652
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:21,843
We can't just leave them.

1653
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:23,237
This girl is getting colder, Sean.

1654
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,447
- Do you know what that means?
- Look-look, I… Look, I...

1655
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:26,348
I don't give a fuck about her temperature.

1656
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:28,266
I give a fuck about us, okay?

1657
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,226
That's what I care about.

1658
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,187
Y... If it's that fucking
serious to you...

1659
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,772
Hey, hey, little dress boy.

1660
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,857
Huh. Take this. It's yours.

1661
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:37,943
Everybody that's darker
than a brown paper bag

1662
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:40,111
should get the fuck from round here.

1663
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:41,404
Los.

1664
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:43,174
- We can't just leave them.
- Yes, we can.

1665
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:45,259
She just said
they're gonna be here any minute.

1666
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:48,370
And I ain't trying to be
no fucking hashtag.

1667
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:49,972
- Le!
- Why does she look like that?

1668
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,290
Why does she got all these bruises
on her face?

1669
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:53,959
…there's got to be something, um...

1670
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:56,795
Look. Hey, we did it.

1671
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,523
- We did what the fuck you wanted to do.
- She's gonna be fine.

1672
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,549
We got her some help. Let's go.

1673
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,737
They're too drunk to drive.
Everybody's too drunk to drive.

1674
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,262
- They can't… -I…
- SEAN: Le...

1675
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:08,431
I can drive.

1676
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,559
- Don't be fucking idiots, okay?
- Rafa.

1677
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:13,395
We can't just leave them.

1678
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,899
She's-she's gonna be fine.

1679
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:19,669
- Maddy, it's-it's gonna be okay.
- Emma.

1680
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,486
Fine.

1681
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,321
Y'all want to play
fucking heroes and shit.

1682
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:24,781
Get a medal, huh?

1683
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,074
I'm out.

1684
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:31,830
And it's not because I'm a bitch
or a coward that I'm leaving.

1685
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,207
I don't care if y'all think that of me.

1686
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,042
Guys, come on!

1687
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,420
I just want to make it to the next day
with my friends.

1688
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:42,090
But my friends just keep wanting to help
these fucking white people.

1689
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,343
Pay attention, Kunle.

1690
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:47,321
- Guys, she needs help. Let's go.
- We need to go.

1691
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,764
- Come on, guys.
- Hurry.

1692
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:21,963
What?

1693
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,966
What?

1694
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,718
I think I need to start CPR.

1695
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:27,886
Um...

1696
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:29,888
- What?
- I think we...

1697
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,973
- Okay.
- Sh-Should I stop?

1698
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:33,892
- Should we stop?
- No.

1699
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,518
No, no, no. We-we need to go.

1700
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:37,371
Can you help me get her down?
Here, we need some space.

1701
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:39,457
- Okay, okay. Um, ready?
- Make sure her head is...

1702
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:40,899
- Um, one, two, three.
- Careful.

1703
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,485
Okay, I can get her head,

1704
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,463
- if you cross over.
- Okay, w-w-wait. Wait.

1705
01:12:45,487 --> 01:12:47,256
- All right? It's okay.
- You ready? There you go.

1706
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,157
Okay. Okay, all right, um...

1707
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,119
I haven't really done this
on a person before.

1708
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:55,121
You got this, man. You can do it.

1709
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:56,891
- All right.
- I believe in you.

1710
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,434
- You can do it. You got it.
- You're right. Okay.

1711
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,460
- You can do it.
- Yes, I can.

1712
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:03,797
Up and down.

1713
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,590
Okay.

1714
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,267
Could you, like,
not sing that song right now?

1715
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:17,745
Oh, oh, Maddy, Maddy, it's, um,

1716
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:18,895
to keep the CPR tempo.

1717
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,332
I-I saw it on Reddit.
- What?

1718
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,284
Why are you singing it, too?

1719
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,289
No, no, no, no, it's just...
it's just the main part,

1720
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:40,293
- just the main part.
- Right, right. Okay, okay.

1721
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:21,499
Fuck.

1722
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,128
Uh, what do I do?

1723
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,091
- Sh-Should I pull over?
- Turn the flashers on.

1724
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,609
- Turn the flashers on.
- Right, right.

1725
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,480
I don't know where anything is
in this car.

1726
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,846
- Up here.
- Right, right, right, right, right.

1727
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:37,265
Pull over.

1728
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,370
- Pull over now, and let the hostage go.
- Shit. Shit. Shit.

1729
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:43,313
We're not hostages! We're not...

1730
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:45,666
That doesn't look good.

1731
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,066
Pull over.

1732
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,278
Pull over now, and let the hostage go.

1733
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:55,759
We're trying to take her to the hospital!

1734
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,952
- Yo, right, right, right, right.
- Right. Right, yeah.

1735
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:03,208
Fuck, man! Come on.

1736
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:05,376
<i>They really think
that we kidnapped you guys.</i>

1737
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,045
Yeah. Fuck, fuck.

1738
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,422
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1739
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,300
Come on. Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Come on.

1740
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,223
Pull over.

1741
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,313
Come on.

1742
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:29,108
Come on. Come on.

1743
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:31,402
Maddy.

1744
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:33,238
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.

1745
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,368
Come on. Come on, Emma!

1746
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,786
This is all my fault.

1747
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,597
- Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
- Maddy.

1748
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,182
I ditched her 'cause I didn't want
to hang out with a fucking high schooler.

1749
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,100
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive. Come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on.

1750
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,584
I'm so fucking stupid.

1751
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:48,002
We are almost there, okay?

1752
01:15:48,086 --> 01:15:49,379
It's gonna be okay.

1753
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,673
Pull over.

1754
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,134
- Right here, right here, right.
- Right?

1755
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,095
<i>We-we're turning!</i>

1756
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,319
Stop.

1757
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:16,281
Um...

1758
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:27,583
Come on!

1759
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,753
Step out of the vehicle now!

1760
01:16:30,837 --> 01:16:33,148
You have until the count of three!

1761
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,091
Guys, we got to get out.

1762
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:36,342
- One!
- Go, Carlos!

1763
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:37,427
Uh, yeah, yeah.

1764
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,594
Um, what do I do? I-I...

1765
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:39,947
How-how do I open the door with my...

1766
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:42,307
- Two!
- Maddy, look at me.

1767
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,642
I swear it's okay. I swear it is.

1768
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:46,060
Three!

1769
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:48,563
Come on.

1770
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:50,165
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1771
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,652
There's been a mistake.

1772
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,784
Hands up!

1773
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:25,701
- Step out of the vehicle now!
- I was just trying to help her.

1774
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,536
I was just trying to help her! I was...

1775
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,914
- -I was just trying to help.
- No! No!

1776
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:32,124
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Wait! Just wait!

1777
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,001
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- My sister...

1778
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:35,753
- My sister needs a doctor. Listen to me.
- Listen, calm down. Calm down.

1779
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:37,087
- Listen to me. Listen.
- Step back.

1780
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,256
I didn't do
anything wrong. I'm trying to help.

1781
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,008
- I'm trying to help.
- My sister needs a doctor.

1782
01:17:41,032 --> 01:17:43,910
I'm just trying to help.
I'm just trying to help.

1783
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,889
- Use your fucking eyes! My sister's dying!
- Please help me. Please.

1784
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:48,932
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Listen to me.

1785
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:50,958
My sister needs a doctor!

1786
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,462
I was trying to help.

1787
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:56,523
Who the fuck are you?

1788
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:58,800
Help my sister now!

1789
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,301
My sister needs help!

1790
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:01,594
Use your fucking eyes!

1791
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,388
My sister's dying in that van!

1792
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:05,556
Stop arresting us, and get her some help!

1793
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,393
- Please, please, Emma!
- We need a medic!

1794
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:10,162
- You, stay there.
- Get my sister some fucking help!

1795
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:12,230
Please, please!

1796
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,856
Emma!

1797
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:18,444
Please, just let me see her.

1798
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:20,655
- Just let me get to her, please!
- Careful.

1799
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,448
Emma, Emma.

1800
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,226
- And then Maddy couldn't find her sister.
- Mm-hmm.

1801
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:21,252
And then we were looking
for her everywhere

1802
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:22,503
and so we started tracking...

1803
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,845
All right.

1804
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,430
I'm giving you kids a warning.

1805
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,181
You're free to go.

1806
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:38,311
Is she gonna be okay, Officer?

1807
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,605
Well, I can't make any promises,

1808
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:43,065
but probably, yes.

1809
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,695
If somebody is unconscious,

1810
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:50,406
just call the pros next time, all right?

1811
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:54,994
Okay.

1812
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:52,968
You all right, man?

1813
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,683
Yeah. I just want, um...

1814
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:02,436
I just want to go...

1815
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,689
I just want to go and check my cultures.
That's all.

1816
01:23:04,772 --> 01:23:07,024
Just, uh, I think I can still save
some of them.

1817
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:08,317
Hey.

1818
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:12,196
It's okay if you're not okay.

1819
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:13,906
Come on, man, I'm fine.

1820
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:16,826
I'm fine. I'm f...

1821
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,036
- Kunle. Hey, Kunle.
- I'm fine. No...

1822
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:22,331
You're my hero, man.

1823
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:24,208
What you did, you...

1824
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:27,670
You were a fucking badass tonight,
all right?

1825
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:29,296
Yeah.

1826
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,006
You were.

1827
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,302
You know, I almost pissed
on my fucking self.

1828
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:37,888
I actually... I-I think I...

1829
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:40,307
I probably did a little.

1830
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,939
To the lab?

1831
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:50,526
Yeah.

1832
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:53,320
Lead the way.

1833
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,437
Sean.

1834
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,778
You're alive, bro. You're alive.

1835
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:35,488
Yeah, I am.

1836
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,651
Yeah, looks like you had a legendary night
after all.

1837
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:39,408
Can you...

1838
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:42,411
How's Goldilocks?

1839
01:24:44,205 --> 01:24:45,790
She's probably gonna be okay.

1840
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,792
That's good.

1841
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,293
Can you… Exc...

1842
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:50,836
Excuse me.

1843
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:56,258
I tried to jam it closed with a fork,
but it didn't work.

1844
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,594
I just used my body.

1845
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:04,141
And I don't really know how to tell
if bacteria is still alive or not.

1846
01:25:16,237 --> 01:25:18,823
Yeah, I-I, um...

1847
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:21,700
I think I'm-I'm gonna...

1848
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,702
bathroom.

1849
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,547
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1850
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,215
I know...

1851
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,218
I'm just... I'm...

1852
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:44,390
I'm sorry for everything, man. I...

1853
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:49,186
I'm sorry I left you, bro.

1854
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:52,648
And I'm sorry for saying
that your babies might be dead.

1855
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:56,610
I-I... I apologize, all right?

1856
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:59,738
And if they are,
I'll tell Princeton that it was my fault.

1857
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:05,786
You know, man, um...

1858
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:07,621
there was a...

1859
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,959
There was a moment tonight where, uh,

1860
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:14,169
I had to do CPR.

1861
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:23,762
I was terrified.

1862
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:29,476
It was real...

1863
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,274
And then the cops showed up.

1864
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:41,697
One of them had a gun, man,
and he just pointed it in my face.

1865
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:46,869
And I kept saying...

1866
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:50,789
"I'm just trying to help, I'm just trying
to help, I'm just trying to help."

1867
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,169
"We didn't do anything wrong.
I'm just trying to help."

1868
01:26:57,630 --> 01:26:59,548
Sean, it didn't matter.

1869
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:01,550
He just...

1870
01:27:01,634 --> 01:27:03,719
he put my face in the ground...

1871
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,805
The gun...

1872
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:10,351
I kept thinking, like, "Oh, shit.

1873
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,937
I'm about to die right now."

1874
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,110
I don't ever want to feel that way again.

1875
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,406
I felt so hopeless, Sean. I felt...

1876
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:26,784
I felt so...

1877
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:29,078
I couldn't do anything.

1878
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,247
We didn't do anything wrong.

1879
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:34,166
I just wanted...

1880
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,211
You were right.

1881
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:38,712
Okay, you were right.

1882
01:27:38,796 --> 01:27:42,299
You said that it was gonna happen
that way, and it happened that way.

1883
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:44,843
You were right, and I know why you left,

1884
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:46,261
and I do not blame you, Sean.

1885
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:48,472
I just don't want to feel that way...

1886
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:54,645
I'm sorry that happened to you, man.

1887
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:57,272
- I'm so sorry, Le.
- It's fine.

1888
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:58,816
- No, it's not.
- It's fine.

1889
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:01,193
It's-it's really fine.

1890
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,239
That shit ain't okay.

1891
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,578
I was so fucking scared, man.

1892
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:13,455
No, I know.

1893
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,543
All right...

1894
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:19,628
I know.

1895
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,464
I was so scared.

1896
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,717
I don't know, man.

1897
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,301
I'm really sorry about all of this.

1898
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,387
I'm really sorry about the Legendary Tour.

1899
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,722
And, um...

1900
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,265
Fuck the tour.

1901
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,726
I almost lost my brother.

1902
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,103
Give a fuck about a tour.

1903
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:38,022
It was never about the parties, man.

1904
01:28:38,105 --> 01:28:40,024
The fucking parties.

1905
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:49,742
When I found out
that you was going to Princeton,

1906
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,368
shit, I just got happy as shit.

1907
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:52,995
Wh-wh-what?

1908
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:54,788
Wait, you knew I was going to Princeton?

1909
01:28:54,872 --> 01:28:56,248
Yeah.

1910
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,585
Man, I knew before you did.

1911
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:03,839
Saw that big-ass envelope in the mail.

1912
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:05,632
I don't know, man, I just...

1913
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:07,468
Look, everybody know
that you gonna be like

1914
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:12,848
the Barack Obama
of fungus and bacteria and such,

1915
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,434
win a Nobel Prize and shit, man.

1916
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,062
You gonna have your own Wikipedia page,
you fucking nerd.

1917
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:23,650
You gonna change the world, bro.

1918
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:28,363
Ten years from now, none of this shit
gonna mean nothing to you.

1919
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,120
It just scared me, bro.

1920
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:37,498
You wasn't gonna say nothing to me.

1921
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:40,501
Just gonna leave and...

1922
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,879
Just tried to do something, you know?

1923
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:46,882
The-the Legendary Tour
would've worked, you know?

1924
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:49,968
We could've been
on the Wall of Firsts, and...

1925
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:51,970
I don't know, man.

1926
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:59,394
Something to prove that, you know, uh,
I guess we both went here together.

1927
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:02,731
And we was friends, you know?

1928
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:08,195
Come on, Sean...

1929
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:12,616
we are still going to be friends
when we graduate.

1930
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,993
Yeah, yeah.

1931
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,745
Yeah.

1932
01:30:17,788 --> 01:30:20,290
You're my best friend.

1933
01:30:21,834 --> 01:30:23,669
You're my best friend, too.

1934
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:31,552
And I really was going to tell you
about Princeton.

1935
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:35,889
It's just, um... I was. I just...
I'm not even sure if I want to go.

1936
01:30:35,973 --> 01:30:37,575
- All right.
- I'm serious. I'm not...

1937
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,410
Just because we're emotional
don't mean that we're stupid.

1938
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,936
I'm just not sure I...

1939
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:43,147
Look, it's Princeton.

1940
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,149
You got to fucking go to Princeton.

1941
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:47,860
You earned it, and you deserve it, Le.

1942
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,781
Plus, I don't even got a job.
I could move closer to you.

1943
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:54,616
Wait, where is... where is...

1944
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:57,035
Where is, uh, Princeton?

1945
01:30:58,245 --> 01:30:59,997
It's in New Jersey.

1946
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,166
- Oh, fuck. I-I...
- I know. I know.

1947
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:03,489
I know, it's New Jersey, but...

1948
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:04,978
- it's not that...
- Yeah, I-I should've thought first.

1949
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:07,713
It's... Yeah, it's still Jersey.

1950
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,440
But it's an hour away from Philly
and New York,

1951
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,859
so that's at least...

1952
01:31:10,883 --> 01:31:13,385
I would not drink that.

1953
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:14,970
It's just water, Kunle. I'm thirsty.

1954
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,847
It... Okay.

1955
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:19,850
You know what, I think you can have
your own Wikipedia page, too.

1956
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:21,602
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1957
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:23,395
But finishing your thesis, graduating...

1958
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:24,747
- Oh, shit.
- These are baby steps.

1959
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:26,457
Like, we don't have to have
it all planned out

1960
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:27,834
- if we can just take...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1961
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:31,403
- I can have... What?
- Hey, hey, hey, calm... calm.

1962
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,322
No more lectures, all right?

1963
01:31:35,282 --> 01:31:37,034
Deal. No more lectures.

1964
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,577
All right.

1965
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:39,912
Come on, man.

1966
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:41,538
I love you, bro.

1967
01:31:43,457 --> 01:31:46,585
I love you, too, man.

1968
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,796
- Group hug!
- What? Oh, shit.

1969
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,232
- Group hug is coming!
- It's okay.

1970
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,633
It's all right.

1971
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:54,176
- Let me in. Let me in.
- Wait, wait.

1972
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:56,178
You got to move your fanny pack
out the way.

1973
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,281
- Hey. Oh.
- So you can get in here without poking people.

1974
01:31:58,305 --> 01:31:59,598
Oh, tuck in.

1975
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:01,201
- Oh, it feels good, right?
- It's good. -Yeah.

1976
01:32:01,225 --> 01:32:02,684
- There you go.
- It's great.

1977
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:04,579
- No, don't, don't, don't go up and down.
- Oh, don't-don't go up and down.

1978
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:06,039
- Don't go up and down.
- That's a little too much.

1979
01:32:06,063 --> 01:32:08,065
That's where it ends.

1980
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,785
They're all okay.

1981
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:22,805
They're all all right.

1982
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:24,873
Oh, wow.

1983
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:27,542
Oh, I'm so tired.

1984
01:32:27,626 --> 01:32:29,962
And I'm so fucking hungry.

1985
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:32,506
Geez, Sean, I...

1986
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:36,093
What a novel and challenging problem
you're having.

1987
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:38,720
I wish there was a solution
to that problem.

1988
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:42,430
- There you go.
- He flipped his fanny pack around.

1989
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,435
I got you, fam.

1990
01:32:45,519 --> 01:32:46,937
All right.

1991
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:50,732
They actually come in handy.

1992
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:00,826
All right, come on.

1993
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:06,164
Safe at last.

1994
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:12,087
I'm-I'm so high, actually.

1995
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:15,590
Los, did you actually run away
from the police?

1996
01:33:15,674 --> 01:33:17,509
A little bit.

1997
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:20,095
- Oh.
- Oh. No.

1998
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,306
Not our problem.

1999
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:24,224
Not our problem.

2000
01:33:37,321 --> 01:33:39,156
This'll be your piece.

2001
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,993
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

2002
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:47,539
Is it… sweet?

2003
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,624
- You-you think so?
- Yeah.

2004
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,418
Those hips don't lie. Certainly.

2005
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:53,045
No, no, hips do not lie. I've been...

2006
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,848
- I've been practicing a-a little bit.
- Oh.

2007
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:56,631
And I-I heard that you...
that, you know...

2008
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:58,395
that you did, like, a little bit of dance.

2009
01:33:58,467 --> 01:34:01,347
- A little bit. Yeah.
- And I thought that I would try just a little bit.

2010
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:13,440
So...

2011
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:14,983
Uh…

2012
01:34:15,067 --> 01:34:16,777
- That's great. That's good.
- Oh. Okay.

2013
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,528
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Um...

2014
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:21,174
Hey, could you... could you get that?

2015
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:22,949
Uh, it's...

2016
01:34:23,033 --> 01:34:24,326
- I'm gonna...
- Yeah.

2017
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,453
- Okay, I-I'll be right back.
- Okay.

2018
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:28,330
Yeah, I'm-I'm up. I'm up.

2019
01:34:30,207 --> 01:34:31,375
Just one second.

2020
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:34,711
Hi.

2021
01:34:34,795 --> 01:34:36,129
Hey.

2022
01:34:36,213 --> 01:34:37,756
Is Carlos here?

2023
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:41,426
Hey, Carlos!

2024
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:42,862
- Yeah, wait, wait, wait.
- Hey, Carlos.

2025
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,137
Just-just hold on a second.

2026
01:34:44,221 --> 01:34:45,847
Now, Los.

2027
01:34:45,931 --> 01:34:48,291
- Come here now.
- A-All right, all right. Wait, wait, wait.

2028
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:52,646
Hi.

2029
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:55,607
Emma, this is Kunle and Carlos.
They saved your life.

2030
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:59,611
Uh, so we don't want to intrude.

2031
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:02,239
We just... we just had something
we wanted to say.

2032
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:06,618
You-you're going first, okay?

2033
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,328
Oh. Uh...

2034
01:35:08,412 --> 01:35:09,996
Thank you.

2035
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,915
Um...

2036
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:14,251
For everything.

2037
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:17,295
Getting me to the hospital and...

2038
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:22,008
Sorry for apparently breaking in
and throwing up everywhere.

2039
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:23,927
So embarrassing.

2040
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,471
Yeah, I-I literally live two doors down,

2041
01:35:26,555 --> 01:35:29,641
so I think she thought this was my house.

2042
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,726
That's what we think I thought.

2043
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:34,187
We don't really know
because I don't remember...

2044
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:35,647
- anything.
- Right.

2045
01:35:37,441 --> 01:35:39,192
But, uh, yeah, we can...

2046
01:35:39,276 --> 01:35:41,736
we can help pay for any rugs
that need to be cleaned or...

2047
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,238
It's cool.

2048
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:45,866
- It's hard... it's hardwood floors.
- Or... Right.

2049
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:47,492
Or the car.

2050
01:35:47,576 --> 01:35:49,178
- 'Cause I know that...
- It's fine. We're just happy

2051
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:51,580
that you're, uh... that you're better.

2052
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:54,809
Uh, Emma, Emma,
why don't you go ahead and, uh...

2053
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:56,751
I'ma talk to them for a second.

2054
01:35:56,835 --> 01:35:58,170
- Yeah.
- Cool.

2055
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,255
Great.

2056
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:02,966
I had, uh, something I wanted to say.

2057
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,926
Just one second.

2058
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:06,428
Uh...

2059
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:08,096
Okay, um...

2060
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,309
Kunle, Carlos...

2061
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:16,813
I want to extend my deepest apologies

2062
01:36:16,897 --> 01:36:19,065
for what transpired the other night.

2063
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:22,527
I'm working on myself and what I put out
into the world, and...

2064
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:24,613
Oh.

2065
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:25,906
Um...

2066
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,992
I'll just leave this in your mailbox then.

2066
01:36:29,305 --> 01:37:29,208
