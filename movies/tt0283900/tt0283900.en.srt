2
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Everything started here

3
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,800
when my plane took off.

4
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,800
No, it's not about a take-off

5
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,900
The beginning is here.

6
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,500
I had an appointment
with Mr Jean-Charles Perrin.

7
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,000
It starts where it should ends.

8
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Good morning, I have an appointment
with Mr Jean-Charles Perrin

9
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,400
You'll find him in the building F 

10
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,700
6/F door 6024

11
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Good morning, I have an appointment
with Mr Jean-Charles Perrin

12
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,400
Somebody for Mr Perrin

13
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Good morning

14
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,700
Good morning, I have an appointment
with Mr Jean-Charles Perrin

15
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,700
OK, please follow me

16
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Ah Xavier

17
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
Good morning Mr Perrin

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
Call me Jean-Charles

19
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
You can't know how happy I am
to see you

20
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,400
Come in

21
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,400
See, that's where I work

22
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
view of Paris...the Eiffel tower

23
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,300
I've known your father since...

24
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,000
at that time we were together 
at the Administration School

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I remember it was in...

26
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,400
My father is somebody 
who can understand that

27
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Meet him, you've nothing to loose, 
he's very nice I've known him for...pfff...

28
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
This is my father 

29
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,800
It's just in your branch

30
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,600
You love the Double Malt

31
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,600
you know this one it's scotish, 
it's marvellous

32
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,000
In fact, everything started 
here when he said : 

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,500
The only thing I know is that 
with the new european directives

34
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,200
some jobs will be created in one year 

35
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
if you make a post-graduate 
about a subject 

36
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,500
that talks about the economic issues 
in Spain

37
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,000
I might be able to help you find a job. 

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There are some openings.

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
but you must speak spanish 
and know the spanish market.

40
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,800
Hablas espaסol ?

41
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Well...un poquito

42
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,300
Do you know Spain ?!

43
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,400
well...I know Ibiza...

44
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Then I decided to leave 
one year for Spain

45
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,700
When I was a kid, I was blond 
and I wanted to be a writer.

46
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,000
And then I changed...
changes happen...

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,500
My mother, to make fast, is a hippy. 
 A real one.

48
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,700
And the problem with real hippies
 is that they always tell the truth 

49
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,000
You don't like bulghur, 
you don't like tofu. 

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
I cannot cook anymore for you.

51
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,200
If you prefer to go in the fast-food
and eat their shit

52
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,200
To wolf down GMO, pesticides,
prions and co...

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Before I wasn't sure but 

54
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,200
now thinking about it, 
I told myself I needed to go. 

55
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,200
Espaסa

56
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,200
I had to gather information about 
european university exchanges.

57
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
It's called ERASMUS.

58
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
And it's a fucking mess...

59
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,500
Please wait !

60
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,300
You wonder who Erasmus is.

61
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,700
I looked on Internet because I didn't know too

62
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,400
and honestly I didn't get everything.

63
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,400
To be quick, I think he was a kind of
dutch traveller around 1500

64
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,800
To register for my post-graduate in Spain, 
it took me 3 months

65
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,700
It's in the office next door.

66
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,800
Have you seen my colleague next door ?

67
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,100
I've just been there.

68
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,500
Good morning it's for
an ERASMUS form

69
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,400
Do you have your registration card ?

70
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,600
I've just got it.

71
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
But, nothing is filled on this.

72
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,900
What do you want me to do with that ?

73
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,100
But I've just got it now, they had lost 
my file, I have to fill another one.

74
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,500
Of course, you're really all the same.

75
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,700
Always filling the forms at the last
moment when it needs a lot of papers...

76
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,200
I've done it but they've lost my file,
it's not my fault if they lose the files.

77
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I just wanted to know what papers do 
I need...

78
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
for the file...

79
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,800
to be complete.

80
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,100
For a Erasmus file, 

81
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,800
for a post-graduate, 

82
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,300
it's easy, 

83
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,000
you should know it's written 
on the card inside the file.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,900
You need agreement of 
your research director here.

85
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,600
You need agreement and signature 
of your research director there.

86
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,400
You need the agreement of 
the university there.

87
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,800
You need the agreement of 
this university.

88
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,300
Your student health insurance card,
you have to give it to me.

89
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Are you SMEREP or MNEF ?

90
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,200
MNEF

91
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Ok then you have to go at the MNEF 
office, building D ground floor

92
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,600
to obtain the form E111.

93
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,100
Don't 'pfffff'. 

94
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,300
If you don't have this document, 

95
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,800
you won't be able 
to get your medical fee 

96
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,300
and medecine costs back 
when you'll be there.

97
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,800
OK, fill all these.

98
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,400
And after of course, like other files, 

99
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,400
a resume, a covering letter, name of your
post-graduate diploma and that's it.

100
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I don't know why the world 
has become such a mess.

101
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I don't know if it's compulsory 
that the world become like that.

102
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,500
Everything is complicated,
badly-made, untidy.

103
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,100
Before there were fields
with cows and chickens.

104
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,300
Everything was more simple I think.

105
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,000
Before we had a direct contact
with things.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,800
In the world of Martine, we had animals.

107
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,100
We ate what we grew.

108
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,900
We built our clothes, our house.

109
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,000
In the farm, the life was
simple for Martine.

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,300
Sometimes I wonder why we have
left the world of Martine.

111
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,300
It's horrible, no ?

112
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,300
Why is it horrible ?

113
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,900
Look how sexist it is !

114
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,700
See the vision of the woman they give.

115
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Bah no why ?

116
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,100
You say that because she gives seeds to chickens

117
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,400
and because she milk cows ?

118
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,400
No but of course,
anyway it's your fantasy.

119
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,400
The little nice girl with the
small skirt and the cheeks all red.

120
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,000
Bah no.

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
When I think that my parents
called me Martine because of her.

122
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm freakin out.

123
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
My mum read that
when she was young.

124
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
It's rather cute I think.

125
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Martine.

126
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
It's not important.

127
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,500
It's because of Martine that you...

128
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm sad that you're leaving.

129
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,700
I'm sad too.

130
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Yes ?

131
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Shit.

132
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Wait Martine.

133
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,200
OK then.

134
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,100
She's sad no ?

135
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,900
Of course.

136
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,200
I'm sad too you know.

137
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
You're sure it's good to go ?

138
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,600
Are you crazy mum,
what are you doing ?

139
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,800
It's not your father's ideas...

140
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,300
Mum ! No, it's not my father's ideas...

141
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,800
I've decided to go,
my plane's leaving in 5 minutes.

142
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,300
I don't want to talk about that now.

143
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,900
I'm sad too you know.

144
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,100
Everybody's sad.

145
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,100
It doesn't seem like.

146
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,300
Don't cry.

147
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,500
We'll see each other soon.

148
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,200
Don't cry Martine.

149
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Don't worry everything will be fine.

150
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,500
Xavier, are you sure about
what you're doing ?

151
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Shut up mum !

152
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Do you want something to drink ?

153
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,400
Erasmus ?

154
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
What are you studying ?

155
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Economy.

156
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Wow serious, market and all that stuff.

157
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Yeah sort of.

158
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Do you know Barcelona ?

159
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,100
No actually i've just arrived.

160
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,600
I can tell you, you're going to enjoy it.

161
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,200
- Really ?
- Really.

162
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,200
You'll see, excellent.

163
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Bye.

164
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,800
This guy had the face of the guys
I usually try to avoid.

165
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,600
And I don't know why,
he absolutely wanted to talk to me.

166
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,400
You'll see, it's a crazy city.

167
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,000
People start to go to the restaurant at 10pm.

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Before, there no one in the restaurants.

169
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,500
After, they started the party !

170
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,200
You have to know the Barcelonians love to party.

171
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
- Have you heard about the 'barres de copas' ?
- No.

172
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,300
I'm not telling you, you'll see.

173
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,200
When coming to make Erasmus you have to cling.

174
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,100
You won't sleep a lot, you'll see.

175
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,400
And you come to do what ?

176
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm a doctor, I've got an important job
at the Hopital del Mar.

177
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,100
I'm a neurologist.

178
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,700
And you ?

179
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,500
We got married 2 weeks ago, she doesn't
know yet what she's going to do.

180
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,800
First, she's going to take
some courses to learn spanish.

181
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,900
You don't speak spanish at all?

182
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,400
And you, you speak spanish ?

183
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,200
Hablas espaסol ?

184
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,600
A little yes.

185
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm here to make a post-graduate
diploma at the Barcelona university.

186
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,500
When arriving in a city,
we see streets in perspective.

187
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,300
Sequences of buildings with no meaning.

188
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Everything is unknown, virgin.

189
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Please, street...

190
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,300
'carrer des escudellers blancs'

191
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,000
Pardon ?

192
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think it's at the end on the left, straight.

193
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,100
- There ?

194
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,900
- Yes there

195
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,900
- OK thanks

196
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,200
Later we'll have lived in this city.

197
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,400
We'll have walked in its streets.

198
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
We'll have been to the end of the perspectives.

199
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,600
We'll have seen all the buildings.

200
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
We'll have lived stories with people.

201
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,500
When we'll have lived in this city,

202
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
we'll have taken this street
10, 20, a 1000 of times.

203
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,600
10, 20, 1000 times...

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,100
After a moment, everything belongs
to you because you've lived there.

205
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,900
It was to happen but I didn't know it yet.

206
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,400
Urquinaona

207
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,400
This thing that sounds weird was added
to the long list of old weird names

208
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,900
that we have somewhere in our brain.

209
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Urquinaona, slightly slipped next to
Mouffetard, Bondoufle, Ponteaux-Combault

210
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Marolles-en-Hurepoix, Mandelieu-La Napoule
 and Knok le Zout.

211
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,200
He becomes normal and familiar.

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,500
After, long after, when we are back in Paris

213
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,400
every hard time has become
an extraordinary adventure.

214
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,100
There is always this stupid stuff
or the worst days of a journey.

215
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,100
The most missed experiences are those
that we talk about most.

216
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,100
- The bell doesn't work

217
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,900
- What ?

218
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,500
- It doesn't work

219
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,000
Who are you searching for ?

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 - A girl whose name is...Sonia Miralpeix.

221
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,200
I am Xavier

222
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,400
Is it possible...the door.

223
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,400
One moment, I open it.

224
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
The only plan I had to sleep
a few days in Barcelona

225
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,100
was from a friend of my mother,
whom, of course, I didn't know.

226
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Some more coffee ?

227
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Your plane was late ?

228
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
It's better.

229
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
This guy who was from chili, has a niece who lives in Barcelona.

230
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,400
and who told him I could stay while searching for an appartment.

231
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,700
But I could not stay long in this flat

232
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,800
because she lived at her grand-father's
and that it was complicated.

233
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,000
It was complicated for me to stay long.

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It was already complicated before I came but,
now I was in a typical shitty plan of my mother.

235
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Never listen to her again,
never follow her plans again.

236
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,200
Thanks mum, never listen to her again...

237
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Never follow her lousy plans.

238
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,100
Hi, Jean-Michel.

239
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,500
Good morning it's Xavier.

240
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,500
We've seen each other at the airport.

241
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,200
OK.

242
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,200
You see who I am.

243
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,300
I'm embarassed.

244
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,300
I feel confused to call you like that.

245
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
No, no, just some guys who...

246
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,100
As you told me that you could...

247
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,400
It's very nice.

248
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,200
And I don't remember who's dead
but anyway now she's in Chili,

249
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
and she just forgot to tell me
that it won't be possible for me.

250
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,700
Listen, honestly, honestly no problem.

251
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,800
I told you.

252
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,200
For us it's the same we've just arrived
so anyway it will be without any fuss.

253
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,500
Make yourself at home.

254
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
I know what it is, it was the same
when I arrived here the first time.

255
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,400
Between French people,
we should help each other, right ?

256
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,000
You can sleep on the sofa.

257
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,800
Anne-So is going to cook you something.

258
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Yes

259
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,400
Are you hungry ?

260
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,500
Yes

261
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,300
I don't have many things to offer.

262
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,300
I can cook....rice...or pasta.

263
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,200
And to go with...we don't even
have butter but oil.

264
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,500
Of course, very good, pasta with olive oil.

265
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Come on.

266
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,900
Sorry, it was hard not to wake you up.

267
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,900
No, no, no ok, no problem.

268
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,300
Would you like some coffee ?

269
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,000
Why not.

270
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,500
At first, it seems like a complexe architecture
but in fact the functioning

271
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
of the brain is quite simple.

272
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,500
OK here is the cortex.

273
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,600
Like this with the 2 hemispheres.

274
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,900
And the memory area

275
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,900
takes place in the hippocampus 

276
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,000
and in the internal part of the temporal lobes.

277
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,100
Of course I summarize...

278
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,100
My speciality is to study everything about the relations
between this area of the brain

279
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,500
which is more or less related to the memory

280
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,600
and this area that manage the language.

281
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,900
We have discovered some extraordinary diseases.

282
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,400
For example, somebody who is bilingual
can have an amnesia which affects 

283
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,800
only one of the 2 languages he knows.

284
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,800
So suddenly because of some traumatism
he knows only his mother tongue.

285
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,400
Nothing more about the second language
he learnt.

286
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Erased from the hard-drive.

287
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,400
Well done no?

288
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I've seen your classified in the newspaper.

289
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,100
Yes for the flat.

290
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,900
I want to share.

291
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,600
'Compartir', tio.

292
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
Compartido.

293
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
To find a flat in Barcelona, it's a real story.

294
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,700
Is it OK for you ?
50 000 every month, it's OK ?

295
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,100
More or less 1000 euros.

296
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,700
50 000 every month, is it OK or not ?

297
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,200
Yes, it's good.

298
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,300
-Sure ? 50 000 the first month.
-I'll see.

299
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,000
Because we thought about selling.

300
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
- The first month, otherwise...
- OK.

301
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
My job has started very quickly, I have to go

302
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,400
Can I ask you a favor Xav ?

303
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Of course, no problem

304
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,100
Can I ask you to go out with Anne-So ?

305
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,900
She's afraid of going out alone.

306
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
As I know you speak a little bit of spanish...

307
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,900
Yes, yes, no problem

308
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,600
I saw you crying in the plane.

309
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,400
You looked so sad.

310
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,400
It made me sad too.

311
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,200
Yes, we say to ourselves
that we're happy to go

312
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,600
that we're strong.

313
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,400
But once in the air, well I wondered...

314
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,700
It's not easy to leave like that,

315
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,700
we leave so much behind.

316
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,300
We don't know exactly where we're going

317
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Yeah

318
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,800
It's a strange mix.

319
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Same for me, I'm so happy with Jean-Michel

320
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,300
I really wanted to follow him,
live something great with him.

321
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,100
And at the same time, I'm scared.

322
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,900
Change your life.

323
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,500
Learn a new language.

324
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I feel like at the bottom of a huge mountain

325
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,300
I needed to write to Martine regularly.

326
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,500
I started to write things
I would never have told her

327
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,900
if she had been in front of me.

328
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,900
I had always been shy but being
far away from her made me talk more.

329
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,900
And at the end, I was closer to her.

330
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,000
Sometimes for the share flats

331
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
you had to go through a real exam.

332
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Moreover, I speak french.

333
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I lived one year in Paris.

334
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,600
It's not always like this,you see...

335
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,800
Instantly, I loved this place.

336
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,700
I would have give anything to be accepted here.

337
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,700
The mess that lived here, looked like the one
that lived inside me since always.

338
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,700
It's as if theirs slanging matches were those
that take place in my head since I'm a child.

339
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
The courses had started, I still didn't have a flat.

340
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Goodbye Anne-Sophie

341
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,500
Fuck, I really don't understand
the course in catalan.

342
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,300
And you, you understand ?

343
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,700
It's not possible, somebody has to ask him.

344
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
"Speak castilian"

345
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,400
 Who asks him ?

346
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,900
Are you student in french ?

347
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,700
Are you from the french course ?

348
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,900
Who ?

349
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,300
You.

350
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,800
OK. Good morning everyone.

351
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,300
I'm going to talk about the future
of the world capitalism.

352
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,300
- Please sir.
- Yes.

353
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,100
Could you make the course in catilian ?

354
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,600
Sorry, it's impossible.

355
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,900
The majority of students are catalan.

356
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,300
They don't have to change their language.

357
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,300
We are 15 ERASMUS students
who don't speak catalan.

358
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,200
And you speak spanish.

359
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,400
I understand you perfectly miss

360
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,800
but understand me too.

361
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,800
We are in Catalonia and the catalan
is the official language.

362
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,800
For spanish, go to Madrid or
in South America.

363
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,700
Let's continue.

364
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,800
I'm going to talk about the future
of the world capitalism.

365
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,500
What can we say about world capitalism ?

366
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,900
What I liked with this girl
is that she didn't fit with economy.

367
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,600
I wondered what she was doing here.

368
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Exactly like I always asked  myself,
what I was doing here.

369
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,300
In the beginning, there was
only one currency : gold.

370
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,100
I speak catalan because I am catalan
and because I live in Catalonia.

371
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,100
I find it contradictory to defend catalan
 while we are building Europe

372
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,600
I don't agree.

373
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,200
First because...we're talking about identities.

374
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,300
There's not just one valid identity,

375
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,700
but several compatible identities.

376
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,900
It's a matter of respect.

377
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,700
Me, for example, I have at least 2 identities.

378
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,500
The gambian identity, that I carry inside of me

379
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,000
and the catalan identity.

380
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,400
It's not contradictory to combine both.

381
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,200
You, you're french, not martian.

382
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,100
You are french

383
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,100
and you keep your french identity.

384
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Do you understand me ?

385
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,600
I give you my 'pan tumaca'

386
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,400
I give you my...my Dali.

387
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,300
Spain is not only 'Ole'

388
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,800
Not only flamenco. It's a lot of things

389
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,000
including catalan.

390
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It must be vey destabilizing 
to be always between 2 languages

391
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,900
Isn't it the same problem in Belgium
with the flemish and walloon ?

392
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,600
Walloon, no it's not the same

393
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,800
For example, I am walloon,
I don't speak flemish

394
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,300
When I am in Flandres, I say I'm french

395
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,300
It's good, super good.

396
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,700
Brilliant !

397
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,400
Then if they understand I'm walloon...

398
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Tomorrow ?

399
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,400
That's brilliant, I've found a flat

400
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,900
Cool

401
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Yes, so...OK

402
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I have shitty room in the house of the mother
of the woman that hires me.

403
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
What are you doing ?

404
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,000
Au pair girl - babysitter

405
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,400
Brilliant !

406
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah brilliant

407
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,200
It's brilliant for you

408
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Yes, it's brilliant for me...

409
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,800
I'm sad that you're leaving.

410
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I want to write books.

411
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
What is it ?

412
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The Spanish Inn
L'auberge espagnole.

413
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,700
This house was literally a spanish inn.

414
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,700
Wait

415
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,800
"Reading is like spanish inns,

416
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,800
we find what we bring in it." Maurois

417
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
It's a little bit complicated
to explain how it works.

418
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,700
But if I summarize, it's more or less like that :

419
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,300
I start with the phone to explain.

420
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,300
No, no, the fridge.

421
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,800
You come soon to see me.

422
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,500
I can't really talk to you now.

423
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,200
But i'm not alone, that's why.

424
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,200
We went out yesterday already, I'm broken.

425
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,900
Not at all but...but it's not one person

426
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,700
there are 5 people behind me.

427
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,300
Listen we're not going to argue on the phone.

428
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,200
It's ridiculous.

429
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,500
You're coming soon to see me.

430
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,500
I want to see you.

431
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Of course.

432
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:56,200
I love you too.

433
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Kisses.

434
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Xavier is not here, he's coming back tonight.

435
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Xavier is not here, he's coming back tonight.

436
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Isn't it beautiful ?

437
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,600
How was it this afternoon ?

438
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Very good.

439
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,000
Where did you two meet ?

440
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,400
In Dinat.

441
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,700
In a pizzeria.

442
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,000
We used to go there every day.

443
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,600
There was a typic italian chef.

444
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,600
"Today I propose you melon,
very good ham, bonnissimo !"

445
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,800
He said that all the time ?

446
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,600
Everyday during 2 weeks.

447
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,700
Everyday...

448
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Yeah I was working in the hopital
nearby and Anne-Sophie...

449
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,200
Go on, tell him.

450
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,200
No, go on, you tell.

451
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,900
Come on, tell him, Anne-So !

452
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Why were you going to 
this restaurant everyday ?

453
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,000
No.

454
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Come one, don't be shy !

455
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Go on, tell him !

456
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,200
No, I feel ashamed.

457
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Don't make such a fuss
what bothers you ?

458
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,000
It's juste intimate, I don't want to tell.

459
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,500
Come on !

460
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,000
Wait it's not important.

461
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,700
She doesn't have to...if she doesn't want.

462
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,000
Fuck Anne-So tell him now !

463
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,100
He's right it's not important !

464
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,100
Get out of your shell baby !

465
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,900
The first time I saw Jean-Michel

466
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,900
at the first sight, I told myself I was in love.

467
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,700
Like that, instantly.

468
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,400
Completely mad about me !

469
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,900
I saw him and I told myself

470
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,900
"It's my husband."

471
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,900
'Love at first' sight, a real one.

472
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,900
You're impossible...

473
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,900
Shit ! Again !

474
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,600
Yes ?

475
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,900
Can I call you back ? At 8 ? OK.

476
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,900
They really piss me off !

477
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Don't get angry Wendy.

478
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,800
- Hello.
- Hello Mr Cucurull

479
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,100
-I'm coming to show around the flat.
- Why ?

480
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,300
I don't speak to you.

481
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,700
Bicycles right in the middle...

482
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,400
We'll have to repaint.

483
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,300
Come in.

484
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,600
My God, the cupboard of my grand-mother !

485
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,600
The living rom.

486
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,100
And the Virgin ?

487
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,600
There was a Virgin here. Where is it ?

488
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,600
It's...elsewhere.

489
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,400
What a shambles !

490
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,900
You have to leave before the 1st of March.

491
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,900
Sorry. I'll take you back to the door.

492
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,500
It was a pleasure.

493
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,900
Can you give a reason ?

494
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,300
I don't want anymore students here.

495
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,300
- Why ?
- Look at the state of the flat !

496
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,600
I didn't finish to wash up.

497
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,300
But Lars and Soledad hadn't finished to eat.

498
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,700
I went to watch the TV

499
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,500
and when I was back you'd done everything.

500
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,500
I was about to do it but you're fussy.

501
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,100
What ? I don't want to live in a pigsty.

502
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,700
I am not fussy !

503
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,700
We are young, OK, but responsible.

504
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
OK you seem serious.

505
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,600
Starting from the next month, i'll talk to you.

506
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,600
And the rent is now 180,000 pesetas.

507
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,600
180,000 pesetas ?

508
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,200
We have to take somebody else.

509
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,400
I know a very nice person
from my economy course.

510
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,900
- Who is it ?
- A girl...

511
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,900
very serious.

512
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,700
Anyway, I speak french.
I spent one year in Paris last year.

513
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I'll call you.

514
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
You don't like her ?

515
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,400
If we can find better...

516
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Unbelievable, you have a lot of stuffs I have.

517
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,500
You've got that CD too.

518
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,500
You too ?

519
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,600
What are you doing tomorrow ?

520
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
My friend Sabine is coming from Belgium.

521
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Cool.

522
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,000
Hi.

523
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,900
Sabine.

524
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,600
Xavier.

525
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Hi.

526
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,300
I really miss you.

527
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,000
It's not because I'm at the beach
that I don't miss you.

528
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,300
Tomorrow it's Sunday we've decided
to go to Sitges.

529
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,300
It's an other beach nearby.

530
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,600
No. Now I am at the beach
but in Barcelona.

531
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,200
Sitges is another beach.

532
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,200
I don't know, it must be different,
another beach.

533
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,600
With the french couple,
you know I told you.

534
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,500
The ones I've met in the plane
and who hosted me.

535
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Well, cool no, but they are very nice.

536
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,700
Is France this way ?

537
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,100
No, rather this way.

538
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,800
We wouldn't have seen each other a lot.

539
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,100
Bah no.

540
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,500
Bye.

541
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,900
Hi everyone !

542
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,600
You want...

543
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,900
And you slept in the same bed ?

544
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,000
Bah yes.

545
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,500
In this one.

546
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,100
Yeah.

547
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,300
Why are you laughing ?

548
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,100
She's my friend.

549
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,200
Did you make some 'stuffs' ?

550
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,000
Xavier, yes, we made some 'stuffs',
she's my girlfriend.

551
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
A woman, I am lesbian.

552
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,100
And you ? When is yours coming ?

553
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,100
Mine...she's coming...soon.

554
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,000
She has some stuffs to finish and...

555
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,700
She's having a lot of problems.

556
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,700
Good luck then.

557
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Women are crazy, trust me.

558
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,000
I hope it's good.
I changed my recipe.

559
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,600
What is it ?

560
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,200
A 'grattin dauphinois'.

561
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,200
- It's like a tortilla...
- I love tortilla !

562
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,600
It's not a tortilla.

563
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,100
There's no eggs.

564
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,100
It breaks my eggs, tortillas without eggs.

565
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,600
I am here honey.

566
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,100
Wendy, we're here.

567
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,100
We're coming.

568
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Here we are.

569
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,800
Ola.

570
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,800
How are you ?

571
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,800
This way.

572
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,400
Join them if you want.

573
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,400
No, no, no way.

574
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,300
She is not a little stupid the English ?

575
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,500
Not at all, she's very cool.

576
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,600
Wait, she's very uptight.

577
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,800
She has a guy ?

578
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,800
Yes, she has.And she not uptight
at all.

579
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Anyway, they managed to give you
the most shitty room.

580
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,500
It's not shitty !

581
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,800
And anyway, I won't stay long
we change in 2 months.

582
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
You've decided to annoy me, that's it ?

583
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,900
No, but you described it
as the dream place.

584
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,900
And honestly...
your room is really shabby.

585
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,600
Look at the wallpaper.

586
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,600
Sorry, but I can't here like that.

587
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,000
It's OK.

588
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I need us to get back together a little.

589
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,500
It's OK, I understand.

590
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,600
And with the others nearby.

591
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,800
Are you upset ?

592
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,300
No, I told you I understand.

593
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,000
It's OK.

594
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,100
But I know we don't have much time together.

595
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:21,000
The 'Everything should be great' stuff,
it's worrying me.

596
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,900
It's dumb...

597
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,900
Please stop. I'm telling you it's OK.

598
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,100
I had the feeling that we spent
more time saying goodbye

599
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:21,100
than seeing each others.

600
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,000
Love sucks.

601
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,600
I find it hard.

602
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,400
Yeah.

603
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,100
I love her though.

604
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,200
But here...

605
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
Same for me.

606
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,200
Sabine left in a bad mood.

607
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,400
It's right that...

608
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,400
What ?

609
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,200
I made a mistake by telling
somebody flirted with me.

610
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,400
Really ? Who ?

611
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,900
A guy ?

612
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,400
No !

613
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,400
My flamenco teacher.

614
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
It was during her course.

615
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
She made again a demo, you see.

616
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,800
She was...

617
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,600
so beautiful.

618
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,500
I had shivers.

619
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,500
She was staring at me.

620
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,000
Then she came near me.

621
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
More and more.

622
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,500
Softer.

623
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,200
At the end, she was really hard with me.
She was slapping my butt.

624
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,400
Move your hips !

625
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Make a curve.

626
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,700
She was squeezing me against her.

627
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,500
Then she turned me.

628
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,400
I could do nothing, I was...

629
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,100
paralized.

630
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,600
She was totally dominating me.

631
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,600
And then ?

632
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,500
It was good.

633
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,500
She kissed me.

634
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,500
Fuck ! And you said that to...

635
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:31,500
to Sabine

636
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,900
Not like this.

637
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,500
Ah OK.

638
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,500
No.

639
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,800
You work too much.

640
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,900
Do you want something to drink ?

641
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,700
Nothing thanks.

642
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,600
Come on, it's for me.

643
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,900
You spend the day here, with one half-pint...

644
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,600
Let me pay you a drink.

645
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,400
What ?

646
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
Where are you from ?

647
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,400
France.

648
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,400
ERASMUS ?

649
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,200
- When did you arrive ?
- 2 month ago.

650
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,800
2 months.

651
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,900
Shit, yes, 2 months.

652
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,700
You spend too much time at the university.

653
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,600
You should come more often.

654
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,000
It's here that you'll learn
what's important in Barcelona.

655
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Leave him alone. He doesn't want
to hear your stupidities.

656
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,100
I teach him spanish.

657
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,800
What's your name ?

658
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,800
Do you know what is a "French" ?

659
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,400
A "French" ?

660
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,800
Come more often,

661
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,800
I'll teach you the spanish
'de puta madre' in 2 months.

662
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,800
'Puta madre'.

663
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,000
He'll never come back.

664
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
After few months, thanks to Juan, I started
to speak a spanish 'de puta madre'.

665
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,600
So, I was always coming to Juan
and Neus's bar.

666
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,800
My friend Xavier ! How are you doing ?

667
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,800
- What's going on ?
- We're having a little party.

668
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,800
- Hi Xavier.
- How are you, Neus ?

669
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,000
Xavier didn't tell me you were so beautiful.

670
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,300
He hid you well, bastard !

671
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,800
What did he say ?

672
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,000
He said...

673
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,200
he welcomed you in his cafe.

674
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,200
- Exactly !
- Asshole !

675
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:52,200
Let's dance.

676
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,800
Hi, my love !

677
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,600
But you said you'll come back !

678
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,800
But wait...

679
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,800
I don't have enough money, I told that
but I don't have enough money.

680
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,200
Me too I didn't have any money,
when I came, I managed to do it.

681
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,700
Really you don't care actually.

682
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,000
I do care.

683
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,900
Yes, every time you promise something,
you can't keep it.

684
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,900
I don't trust you anymore.

685
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,500
For my birthday, it's really lousy.

686
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,600
Where are you ? At the beach again ?

687
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,200
No, I am in Barcelona, in the street.

688
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,200
The music...I am in front of a cafe,
there's music everywhere, stop it !

689
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:14,100
It stinks no ?

690
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,100
It's a pity that Barcelona is such a dirty city.

691
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,900
Not more than Paris I think.

692
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,900
Yes of course it is.

693
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,600
There are  a lot of places here
that look like the Third World.

694
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,100
I know a lot of places in Paris
that look like the Third World too.

695
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:41,100
But I'm not surprised
that you don't know them.

696
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,500
You think I am uptight, right ?

697
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,900
No.

698
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,200
Yes, I can imagine what you think.

699
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,500
You think : "Poor girl, she's totaly uptight"

700
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,700
No, it's not true.

701
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:02,500
You think I am old-fashionned.

702
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,400
A little yes.

703
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,200
You are not really 'Juanita banana'

704
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,400
What is that ?

705
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,400
Let's say you're not really rock n' roll,
but you know it.

706
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Yes I know it.

707
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,800
Does it bother you ?

708
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
No.

709
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,300
It bothers me.

710
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,600
I am not dumb you know, Xavier.

711
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,900
You, you're so at ease.

712
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,100
Everywhere.

713
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,700
All the time.

714
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,900
You pick up spanish in a few months.

715
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,500
You're intimate with everyone.

716
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,200
But I cannot.

717
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,400
I didn't have your education.

718
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,400
I am not as casual.

719
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,600
I know that here, you have to be cool.

720
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,400
But I'm not cool,

721
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,200
rock n' roll as you say.

722
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,000
Listen, it's not that important.

723
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It's not a reason to say that Barcelona
and its inhabitants are dirty.

724
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,800
It's not being 'not rock n' roll',
it's just racism.

725
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,800
- It's racism ?
- Yes.

726
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm sorry.

727
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,900
I didn't want to offend you.

728
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,500
It's not about offending me !

729
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,600
You're no more in France now,
it's been 6 months that you're here.

730
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,000
You should look around yourself.

731
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I look around...You are so horrid to me...

732
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,100
Hi, Anne-Sophie.

733
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,800
It's Xavier.

734
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,400
Yes.

735
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,400
Today ?

736
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,200
Of course.

737
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,200
OK.

738
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,200
See you.

739
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,500
Sorry.

740
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,200
It's beautiful no ?

741
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,900
Yes.

742
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,900
Are you afraid ?

743
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,800
A little.

744
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,800
It's stupid but I always had a little vertigo.

745
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Too bad that Jean-Michel cannot see that.

746
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,300
Yeah.

747
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,800
He works so much.

748
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,800
Actually Anne-Sophie,
it doesn't bother you his working so much ?

749
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,800
And that your being alone so often ?

750
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,800
While you're here to be with him.

751
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,300
Yes.

752
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,700
But I scold him quite often for that.

753
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,200
Suzanna is gone ?

754
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,500
She went to buy some cigarettes.

755
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,600
Well...

756
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,000
No, no, no, no.

757
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Go on. What ?

758
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,100
It's really stupid you know...

759
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,600
I've always wondered.

760
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,600
Are you using stuffs like
dildos between girls ?

761
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,800
It's funny because, often you guys,
you never understand women.

762
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,300
It's stupid I think, each sex is on his side,
without any interest for the other.

763
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,400
While I'm sure that if a guy would
like to be interested in women

764
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,900
he'd be the king of the oil king.

765
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,700
What do you mean ?

766
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,700
I don't know, you don't get that
women have a very different psychology.

767
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Furthermore, you don't know
the women's body, what gives her pleasure.

768
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,800
Why do you say that ?

769
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,900
You think that only your dick
can give pleasure while

770
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,000
caresses are bloody important.

771
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,700
Oh yes that I know !

772
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,700
You know but you probably do it wrong.

773
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,600
Look.

774
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,600
Come.

775
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,500
What ?

776
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,300
When you caress the ass of a girl,

777
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,300
you caress here,

778
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,800
here, on the butt.

779
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,600
Wait.

780
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,700
You spread her thighs.

781
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,300
- OK, but I feel ashamed you know.
- No, I show you.

782
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,900
You hold her very tight, like that.

783
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,000
You prevent her from moving.

784
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
She must feel that you hold her tight.

785
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,900
Despite all the bullshits women
will say about that,

786
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,900
most of them want this firmness,
to be trapped.

787
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,900
Wait, stop.

788
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,900
What are you doing ? Stop !

789
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,600
You want me to continue my explanation ?

790
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,300
OK go on.

791
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:38,300
You hold her tight.

792
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,500
After you caress her hair.

793
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,000
The back of the neck.

794
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,800
The breast.

795
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,700
Here, she'll be like you, she'll panic.

796
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,900
You calm her down.

797
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,900
You take your time.

798
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,900
I'll show you how to give pleasure.

799
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,100
Suzanna, come !

800
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,200
I want to show something to Xavier.

801
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,200
Practical work, I'll show you
what every men should learn.

802
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,400
Hi.

803
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,800
I'm happy to see you.

804
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,400
Me too.

805
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,200
It's funny to meet here.

806
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,200
You remember, we had our first walk here.

807
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,600
Ah yes.

808
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,400
No, what are you doing ?

809
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,400
I can't stand it anymore, I want you.

810
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,400
- No Xavier, what's the point of it ?.
- There's no point.

811
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,300
But I am married.

812
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:58,300
No, I am married.

813
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I cannot.

814
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,600
My God, I promise, it was so good.

815
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,400
It was like in the movies.

816
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,500
First she was like :

817
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,200
'No, no, no, no' 

818
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,600
Then after : 'Yes, yes, oh yes'. Unbelievable.

819
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,000
I didn't know it could work like that !

820
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,900
You see, I told you.

821
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,300
They are all bitches.

822
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,600
Yeah you're right.

823
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,200
Unbelievable really.

824
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,400
Next time, I take her hair like that

825
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,700
- And I say : 'Come on, suck bitch !'
- Stop it !

826
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:23,500
Don't speak like that !

827
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:27,500
No.

828
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,500
After a while, the life in the flat
was more organized.

829
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,500
The houseworks were mainly
handled by Wendy.

830
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,400
And from time to time, we gave a hand.

831
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,400
The fridge got more organized too.

832
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,500
Alessendro is gone.

833
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,600
No problem.

834
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:37,900
You know what ?
I love your monologues.

835
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,100
We're going out tonight.

836
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:22,200
Can I talk to you ?

837
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,800
In spanish ?

838
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,500
As you like.

839
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,700
What do you want talk about ?

840
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:31,700
Your brother.

841
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:32,700
I think you're making me crazy.

842
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,700
We shouldn't do that, here at your place.

843
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
No, wait, I'd better go.

844
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,400
- Sure ?
- Yes.

845
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,400
Don't take it bad.

846
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,000
Hello.

847
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Oh Xavier !

848
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,600
I'm glad to see you.

849
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,200
- It's been a while.
- Yes right.

850
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,200
- In fact, I was about to leave.
- No, don't leave.

851
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,000
Come on, stay to take a drink.

852
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I get ride of my stuffs, I come back.

853
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:20,500
Please stay, stay.

854
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:25,100
So Xavier, I've heard that you bring
my wife to the strange bars of Barcelona.

855
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:30,500
Yeah I debauch her...a little.

856
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,500
Hi sweetie.

857
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,900
Hello.

858
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:59,900
How are you ?

859
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,900
How long ?

860
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:19,100
For how long ?

861
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,600
Who is he ?

862
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,600
What's his name ?

863
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
What do you want me to say ?

864
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,800
Yeah, right, bye.

865
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,000
But you don't love me too.

866
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,500
Of course I love you.

867
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:27,000
If I left, it had nothing to do
with the fact that I don't love you.

868
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,200
It's a chance to live what I live, it's just
too stupid that we're not there together.

869
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,400
It's not a reason to break up. 
I need you Martine.

870
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,900
But you've never loved me,
because you're not able to love anyone.

871
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,800
- No, it's not true.
- Your only interest is you, you, you. 

872
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,700
Your studies, your career, your job
at the fucking ministry.

873
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,700
Not at all. It's not true.

874
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,500
- Yes it is.
- It's not true.

875
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,800
Your parents will be so delighted
about the job at the ministry

876
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,800
Your father, the friend of your father.

877
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,300
Your mother.

878
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:50,900
You love your mother at least.

879
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,100
But no.

880
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,600
Don't worry it's fluid.

881
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,600
We'll be at the airport in 15 minutes.

882
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:05,300
I'm glad to have seen you a little.

883
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,600
Even if it was short.

884
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,400
So you still don't want to tell me
why you came back for just one day ?

885
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,800
We can talk, no ?

886
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,200
You're not happy to see me ?

887
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:26,200
Shut up ! Fuck mum !

888
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,200
Shut up !

889
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:33,200
I understood later what happened this day.

890
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:37,000
Sometimes life can be worse
than a bad sitcom.

891
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
This means 'He's yours ?'

892
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:46,400
And that means 'Yes and yours too.'

893
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,900
And after it's like :

894
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,700
'Why didn't you tell me before ?'

895
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:58,700
'I didn't know how to contact you and I thought
about keeping him without telling you'

896
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,700
'I thought I was stronger but
now it's been 6 months'

897
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,000
'It's so hard for me.'

898
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,900
'I'm alone and this child 
doesn't know his father.'

899
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:10,900
A baby, how nice !

900
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,800
We share the flat at 7.

901
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,600
I'm tired of your relaxed style.

902
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,200
You are a father. You have a baby.

903
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,100
I don't know...

904
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,900
Shout, cry, break everything,

905
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:29,900
but do something, react !

906
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,400
I don't know why my life has
always been such a mess.

907
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,000
It has always been complicated,
badly-made, untidy

908
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,700
in a jumble.

909
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:44,700
I feel that life is easier for the others,
more coherent, more logical.

910
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:16,400
Before my life was already a non-sense.

911
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,400
But now, it turned to be totally non-sense !

912
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,300
Everything was going wrong.

913
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,800
On my way to Mare Magnum,
I saw Wendy with her American.

914
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,000
and I don't know how, I bumped into Erasmus.

915
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
- Erasmus ?
- Yes.

916
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:42,200
Sorry, I don't understand.

917
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,400
It's not important.

918
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,900
I was so happy to meet you.

919
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,800
It's not important.

920
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,400
At the beginning you've seen
I was really excited.

921
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,300
Doesn't matter I told you.

922
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:00,300
Yes, I know but...

923
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,800
But Xavier you know, it doesn't matter.

924
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:09,900
I'm happy to see you.

925
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,500
Erasmus ?

926
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,900
Yes.

927
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,500
Sorry.

928
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,400
I think I'm not well.

929
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,400
I don't sleep anymore, I'm depressed.

930
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,100
I don't know if it's normal.

931
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,200
Maybe it's not that serious.

932
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,700
Maybe your limbic system is bothering you.

933
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:02,000
What is that ?

934
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,600
The primitive part of the brain.

935
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,600
Where the most animal emotions take place.

936
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,600
Contrary to the cortex
who manage more elaborated reactions.

937
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,400
- Does it give visions ?
- You have visions ?

938
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:21,200
What kind ?

939
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:25,500
I see Erasmus.

940
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:30,200
We're going to do some analysis.

941
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,600
Close your eyes and count up to 10.

942
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,600
I'm searching for the hippocampus.

943
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,600
The hippocampus is in the internal
part of the temporal lob.

944
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,300
But...

945
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,500
I don't understand french anymore.

946
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:45,500
Don't worry, we're going
to wash everything.

947
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:56,200
I've forgotten my mother tongue.

948
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:04,900
Clean that !

949
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,700
What are you doing here honey ?

950
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:22,700
Nothing, I'm having a walk.

951
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:32,500
Xavier, you drive me crazy.

952
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,600
Jean-Michel !

953
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,800
OK.

954
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,200
Inside you'll find all the exams.

955
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,700
That's what I thought,
you have absolutly nothing.

956
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:01,400
You're just overworked.

957
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:04,000
You haven't seen things...

958
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Now you know, we can see everything
with the scanner.

959
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,300
Nothing.

960
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:15,300
On the other hand, I want you
to stop seeing Anne-Sophie.

961
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,600
She told me everything.

962
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,400
I don't want you to see her again.

963
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,500
I don't want to see you neither.

964
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,600
But...

965
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,600
Shut up.

966
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,700
I stopped seeing Anne-sophie.

967
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:41,700
On the other hand,
Wendy continued to see her American.

968
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,400
Do you remember who is Alistair ?

969
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,500
Wendy's boyfriend.

970
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,400
Sure.

971
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,100
Fuck !

972
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:41,100
You've seen him when he came to the flat.

973
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,000
Why ? 

974
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,900
He's just arrived in Barcelona.

975
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:48,300
He's coming ! In Barcelona ?

976
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:51,600
I can't be...fuck !

977
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,600
I've to arrive before him.

978
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:19,700
Fuck !

979
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I'm taking the phone. Be careful.

980
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:42,400
Hi Alessandro. I listen.

981
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,200
Fuck it...OK...

982
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:49,200
- We're coming.
- What ?

983
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:00,700
Shit !

984
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:48,200
How are you Lars ?

985
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:06,500
- Sorry.
- What do we do ?

986
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,300
He's going to suspect something.

987
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:13,300
Do as if your key was not working.

988
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,800
The end of the year was near.

989
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:12,300
I started to list all the things
I wanted to do in Barcelona

990
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:16,300
and I didn't do at the end.

991
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,600
- Have you been there ?
- Yeah.

992
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:27,200
I surely missed a lot of things.

993
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Too bad you're not a girl.

994
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:38,500
The world should be different.

995
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,800
I was to leave the day after.

996
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,800
We had decided to go in a bar
nearby to say goodbye.

997
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,200
But I wasn't ready.

998
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:00,400
My luggage were not ready.

999
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:05,900
It's bloody hot here.

1000
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,900
- You're here ?
- I'm a friend of Soledad.

1001
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,900
I lived with her.

1002
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,500
I mean, in the same flat.

1003
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:25,000
I knew.

1004
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
We're leaving, I must wake up early tomorrow.

1005
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:32,100
Thanks you, it's very nice.

1006
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:35,700
I'm glad that the both of you came.

1007
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,400
Really.

1008
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:42,400
OK bye.

1009
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,900
Goodbye Anne-Sophie.

1010
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:55,900
Goodbye.

1011
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:52,400
Sorry.

1012
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
- Practice your spanish.
- Yes, see you soon.

1013
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:21,100
- Have a nice trip.
- Bye Lars

1014
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:30,300
Come on, go away !

1015
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:50,900
I'm going to France next year.

1016
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:53,200
- You speak french ?
- Yes.

1017
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,800
You didn't tell me !

1018
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:00,200
I must go now.

1019
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:04,200
We'll meet again.

1020
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:09,100
Have a nice trip !

1021
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:12,400
Bye, see you soon.

1022
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:16,400
Speak catalan !

1023
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,100
Last call for the passengers

1024
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:07,100
of the flight Air France 1349

1025
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,700
to Paris Charles de Gaulle.

1026
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:14,700
Immediate boarding gate 32.

1027
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,500
It was strange to buy meat !

1028
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,700
It seems to me I didn't buy any for years.

1029
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:34,900
You're going to love it.

1030
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:37,100
I bought it at the butcher's you like.

1031
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:41,100
I'll do it.

1032
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Thanks.

1033
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:58,200
You're happy to be back ?

1034
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:02,200
Yes.

1035
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:10,200
You don't say a word ?

1036
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:14,400
I don't know, it was good, that's all.

1037
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,900
Tell me.

1038
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:19,900
I had stayed there for one year, Mum.

1039
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:22,700
Exactly, I haven't seen you for one year
and you've nothing to say.

1040
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:26,700
Come on stop Mum.

1041
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,700
I'm happy to see you again.

1042
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:36,700
It doesn't seem like.

1043
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,200
Why did you say that ?

1044
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:46,200
I told you that because...

1045
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,700
Because I knew it would hurt you.

1046
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:55,500
I know you loved me.

1047
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:59,500
But sometimes, we need to hit
where it's going to hurt.

1048
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,800
I knew it was our last kiss.

1049
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:21,800
I thought about the first one.

1050
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,700
I remember it was on 'la rue d'Orchampt'.

1051
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:32,700
I don't know why we had chosen the street
of Paris with the smallest pavement.

1052
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:41,900
I thought that a lot hapened
between these 2 kisses.

1053
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:45,900
All these streets I've been with her.

1054
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,400
All this complicated path.

1055
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,800
To arrive here, today.

1056
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,800
Without her.

1057
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:20,200
I found myself in the streets of Paris
where no Parisian go.

1058
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,800
I was a stranger among the strangers.

1059
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:39,100
Why I was here, I didn't know.

1060
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:43,100
Generally, I've never known why I was here.

1061
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,600
I must be typical.

1062
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:07,400
Erasmus ?

1063
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:11,400
Why ?

1064
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,100
I passed the entry exanimation.

1065
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:38,000
It's the first day of work.

1066
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,700
I had the same stomach ache
I used to feel in high school.

1067
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:43,600
First day of class, exams.

1068
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,600
This fucking stomach ache.

1069
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,600
I thought it was finished.

1070
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,400
Here it is.

1071
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,400
The 2038.

1072
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,600
Here's your office.

1073
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:00,100
I was told you've arrived.

1074
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,800
Welcome aboard.

1075
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:03,000
- Good morning Bernard.
- Good morning mister.

1076
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,800
- Tell him everything.
- Don't worry.

1077
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,200
The file we talked about.

1078
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:11,200
I don't have much time, but I see you soon.

1079
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:16,100
A little coffee ?

1080
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:19,000
You'll see, the building is a little austere

1081
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
but there's a good atmosphere.

1082
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,300
Yes, it's true.

1083
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:26,300
It's true, we laugh, don't we,
mister Bernard ?

1084
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:30,400
- You'll see.
- Let's go.

1085
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:41,600
How old are you ?

1086
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,200
25.

1087
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:47,200
Wow, you'll be a young retired then.

1088
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,800
For the heater, they use to heat a lot.

1089
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,000
So, I put it on 2.

1090
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,400
2 is good, it's really enough.

1091
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,900
Regarding the files, make no mistake.

1092
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:02,900
You have the yellow ones,
blue ones, and red ones.

1093
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:05,400
Same for the computer file.

1094
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:07,600
They are quite finicky about that
at the European Commission.

1095
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:10,300
Ah yes, they don't laugh about that.

1096
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:11,500
It must be orgaized.

1097
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:14,800
Every thing has its place,
and there's a place for every thing.

1098
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,800
Isn't it, mister Bernard ?!

1099
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:43,000
I choose a futur without openings.

1100
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,300
I'm going to do what
I've always wanted to do.

1101
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,700
I'm going to write.

1102
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:50,700
Everything seems simple and clear.

1103
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:52,900
I am not that.

1104
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:56,900
Nor that.

1105
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,000
But I'm all that.

1106
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I am him, him, him...

1107
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:12,000
"I'm going to write books"

1108
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
And I don't want to deceive him.

1109
01:52:16,700 --> 01:52:20,200
I am her, her...

1110
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:23,800
I am french, spanish, english, danish.

1111
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:25,800
I am not one but several.

1112
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,900
I am like Europe, I am all of that !

1113
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:31,900
I am a real mess !

1114
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,500
Now, I can start telling you everything.

1115
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,700
Everything started here

1116
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:37,000
when my plane took off.

1117
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,100
No, it's not about a take-off.

1118
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:44,100
Well actually, it's about a take-off.

1119
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:48,400
Everything started here.

1120
01:52:49,305 --> 01:53:49,715
