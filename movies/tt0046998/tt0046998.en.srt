{2603}{2699}THIS STORY AND ITS CHARACTERS|ARE IMAGINARY.
{2703}{2841}THEY SHOULD NOT BE SEEN TO|REPRESENT REAL PEOPLE OR EVENTS.
{2894}{2989}DANGLARD'S THE CHINESE SCREEN|PRESENTS 'LA BELLE ABBESSE'
{3174}{3245}Come see me in the Casbah!
{3386}{3426}Not too nervous?
{3430}{3489}Looks like a rough crowd,|Monsieur Danglard.
{3495}{3537}I'd sooner enter a cage of tigers.
{3541}{3593}You have to tame them,|or they'll eat you alive.
{3598}{3653}Hide your fear|and they'll eat out of your hand.
{3657}{3695}That's easy to say.
{3817}{3967}# I was born at Sidi Bel Abbes|in the land of beautiful women #
{4175}{4229}My mother was a princess,
{4268}{4332}and my father said, 'Caramba!'
{4489}{4546}Don't tell me you'd rather|go back to house painting.
{4550}{4594}I'm sure you're a great whistler.
{4598}{4676}When I heard you on your ladder,|I knew I could use you.
{4680}{4726}- Really?|- I'm telling you.
{4730}{4824}- Will you be in the audience?|- Don't worry. I'll be watching you.
{4964}{5010}You're doing very nicely.
{5022}{5052}Evening.
{5105}{5147}Go ahead, sweetheart.
{5241}{5270}There he is!
{5274}{5338}Is this where the fillies weigh in?
{5342}{5412}How about taking me on as a jockey?
{5416}{5470}You're too heavy.|They're over there.
{6066}{6128}Captain, is the country prepared?
{6132}{6222}All I need say is, lances|have been restored to the cavalry.
{6226}{6295}How about Russian railway shares?
{6299}{6341}Hopeless.|Muzhiks walk everywhere.
{6345}{6436}- What do you say, Coudrier?|- Once I leave my office, 'Curtains!'
{6440}{6518}Incidentally, have you heard|that Konakri has voted a subsidy?
{6522}{6561}We'll discuss it tomorrow.
{6581}{6614}Slaves!
{6626}{6651}Yes, Monsieur Coudrier.
{6655}{6745}Bring me hookah, hashish|and the navel of La Belle Abbesse.
{6779}{6861}The paradise of Mahomet,|my dear chap.
{6865}{6923}Jealous, my friend?|- Like a tiger.
{6963}{7016}Good evening, my dear prince.
{7020}{7062}Come to share our worries?
{7066}{7113}I would greatly like to have worries.
{7144}{7190}Do I dare ask him to pay my rent?
{8021}{8098}I'm off to the White Queen.|Who loves me, follows me.
{8102}{8156}- Montmartre? That's dangerous.|- Exactly.
{8160}{8200}Where's Montmartre?
{8204}{8248}Where you were born.
{8252}{8293}Come.|- Strange idea.
{8299}{8357}We're going to see|the little ladies!
{9058}{9125}Inspector, the big fish|don't come here now.
{9129}{9170}They don't trust me.
{9174}{9224}Neither do we.|We're watching you.
{9228}{9298}What a life!|If only I could sell and retire.
{9324}{9366}Excuse me, Inspector.
{9480}{9530}Monsieur Danglard, what an honor!
{9608}{9674}- Scram!|- Hands off the merchandise!
{9695}{9740}You'll be comfortable here.
{9812}{9858}What will you have?
{9862}{9943}- Only champagne for me.|- The lady will have red wine.
{9947}{10000}It's on the house.
{10009}{10068}Cherries in brandy for everyone.|- Yes, boss.
{10094}{10179}What do those stuffed shirts want here?
{10187}{10265}They're slumming, for thrills.
{10616}{10682}- She's nice, that little one.|- Which one?
{10925}{10966}They're wild!
{10970}{11060}Didn't our grandmothers|call this the cancan?
{11064}{11098}No, the chahut.
{11102}{11143}Land values are rising here.
{11147}{11235}You're enterprising.|You'd do well here.
{11239}{11337}With a clientele like this?|What do you think, Walter?
{11341}{11414}- I'm just your backer.|- And profit taker.
{11418}{11463}On occasion.|Ideas are his department.
{11467}{11533}Alas, I can't afford|to back them myself.
{11563}{11617}Know what I mean?|- Let's dance.
{11667}{11713}My little pet!
{11718}{11813}Don't be put off by appearances.|The White Queen is good business.
{12475}{12515}Ladies?
{12537}{12588}- Shall we?|- Let's relive our youth!
{12594}{12630}But ladies!
{14946}{14988}You like the cancan?
{14992}{15046}Better than working in the laundry.
{15491}{15545}You seem upset, pretty lady.
{15549}{15642}Not at all.|I'm enjoying myself enormously.
{15687}{15731}Do you waltz?
{15876}{15922}Waltzing with another man?
{16892}{16958}Our friend Danglard|is straying again,
{16970}{17088}which means our distraught beauty will|seek consolation in Papa Walter's arms.
{18478}{18508}Come.
{18799}{18838}You don't care about me.
{18842}{18894}- He dances so well.|- Do I dance so badly?
{18898}{18946}That's different. I love you.
{18950}{19020}You've got a gold mine there.
{19024}{19086}To dance like that,|he must be a duke.
{19090}{19123}Or an artist.
{19127}{19189}- Did you make a date?|- That's enough!
{19193}{19244}Think what you will, Bidon,
{19250}{19318}but what little money I have,|I earn honestly.
{19322}{19376}We'll go somewhere else|on Saturday, Nini.
{19380}{19425}You don't look too happy.
{19616}{19650}Coming, my dear?
{19654}{19726}I'm going home.|Are you coming, Zizi?
{19730}{19823}You'll exhaust my patience in the end.|Come home with me.
{19827}{19879}I take orders from no one.
{19885}{19951}But we are ever at your command.
{20048}{20102}Come. We'll find|a carriage further along.
{20106}{20144}Very well.
{20170}{20232}- You're not angry?|- Of course not.
{20260}{20311}What do you see in that girl?
{20315}{20400}Everything and nothing.|She dances like a goddess, that's all.
{20404}{20446}You said that when you met me.
{20450}{20515}But I'll never tell her.|I don't even know her name.
{20542}{20597}- Really?|- I swear.
{20628}{20678}Don't think I'm jealous.
{20682}{20719}On the contrary.
{20723}{20783}At least admit|that I'm not jealous, either.
{20787}{20833}What's that supposed to mean?
{20842}{20880}Nothing.
{20916}{20982}Baron Walter and the others.
{20986}{21046}Zizi, darling,|that's completely different.
{21285}{21319}Yes?
{21396}{21455}It's the bailiff, boss.
{21500}{21543}A visitor, darling?
{21555}{21614}Yes, a little social call.
{21800}{21834}Here.
{21960}{22006}Can you pay?
{22032}{22070}Just a moment.
{22268}{22318}A drop in the ocean.
{22344}{22470}There ought to be 500 louis|in the till of the Chinese Screen.
{22499}{22558}Perhaps there's a little something|tucked away here.
{22632}{22662}Here you go.
{22683}{22729}That's hardly enough.
{22733}{22814}I regret that I must give you|this summons
{22818}{22904}and commence an inventory|of your possessions.
{22912}{22962}They're arresting you? Why?
{22966}{23027}- Worse than arrest.|- What is it?
{23031}{23085}Our friend Baron Walter|is out for my skin.
{23089}{23136}And you're going to let him have it?
{23140}{23196}He brought up my mortgages.|I can't fight this paper.
{23200}{23238}Is that all the trouble?
{23242}{23336}I must place it directly in the hands|of the person concerned.
{23516}{23553}Vixen!
{23557}{23610}Now it's in the hands of|'the person concerned. '
{23614}{23705}I shall leave my clerk|to make the inventory.
{23711}{23765}General Boulanger calls on me often.
{23769}{23833}I'll remember you|when he's in power.
{23838}{23892}You're tilting against windmills.
{23896}{23978}They've no end of such bits of paper.
{23982}{24055}- Are you unhappy?|- Not with you at my side.
{24059}{24113}If you wish, I'll give up|everything for you.
{24145}{24241}Can you see yourself living|in a cottage on bread and love?
{24246}{24288}I don't need much.
{24292}{24424}In the big fireplace we could roast|the wild boar you'd kill in the hunt.
{24446}{24531}We'd have a very ancient cook
{24535}{24618}and a terribly young servant girl|to do the cleaning.
{24645}{24728}Sounds like|a perfectly balanced bill.
{24734}{24776}Now get dressed, darling.
{24780}{24810}I will.
{24840}{24882}But Walter will pay for this!
{24940}{25010}Is this really the horn used in|Emilienne de Passy's famous number?
{25034}{25089}She sounded like|the English queen herself.
{25093}{25134}I found her|on the rue Mouffetard.
{25138}{25222}You know, I'm a bit of an artiste myself|in my spare time.
{25226}{25263}I sing, I dance.
{25267}{25350}My friends all call me|Serpentine Casimir.
{25375}{25457}Couldn't you give me a chance|at the Chinese Screen?
{25461}{25551}I'd drop everything else in a flash.|Watch what I can do.
{26022}{26056}I see.
{26064}{26146}But is the Chinese Screen still mine?
{26150}{26185}Zizi, help me.
{26211}{26279}You've got a good job, Casimir.|Keep it.
{26305}{26346}The theater isn't a living.
{26350}{26440}Art, audiences, applause -|that's all very nice,
{26463}{26558}but you're always at the mercy|of the man with the money.
{26584}{26669}He twists your arm|whenever he pleases.
{26675}{26715}Tighter!
{26752}{26836}Slaves - that's what we are.
{26842}{26941}If I had a son,|I'd make him a civil servant.
{26947}{26981}Anything with a pension.
{26985}{27090}Maybe, but the stage is in my blood.|From now on, I'm your man.
{27094}{27201}Well, poor Casimir, you've got|a lovely future ahead of you.
{27402}{27519}I've seen some changes in the|neighborhood, sir, I can tell you.
{27523}{27579}All our customers used to be locals,
{27583}{27649}but last night we even had|a grand duke.
{27653}{27685}A grand duke?
{27690}{27738}Careful!|You'll drown your absinthe.
{27742}{27819}He wanted champagne,|but he got absinthe like everyone else.
{27823}{27867}He even tipped me a louis.
{27871}{27921}Only the White Queen doesn't change.
{28193}{28235}- Waiter.|- Sir?
{28545}{28589}Who's the guy|you were with last night?
{28593}{28655}He won't set me up in a palace.
{28659}{28708}He bought me a beer,|then I went home.
{28712}{28746}- Good day, Henriette.|- Hello, girls.
{28750}{28819}- Have you been shopping?|- What have you got there?
{28823}{28885}Veal. My boyfriend|has a delicate stomach.
{28889}{28939}He only eats white meat.
{28977}{29030}Six months ago|she carried baskets, too.
{29034}{29070}Some have all the luck.
{29076}{29168}But she didn't rush into it.|She found out all about him first.
{29304}{29366}- What about you and Paulo last night?|- What about it?
{29370}{29439}- You treat him horribly.|- I like him, but he's too young.
{29443}{29497}Can you see him with a family?|- But he's nice.
{29501}{29539}He'll be nicer when he's the boss.
{29694}{29751}Young or old, I'll take|the first who comes along,
{29757}{29830}provided he gets me out|of that laundry... by respectable means.
{29856}{29930}Hey, there's your dancer from last night.|- Oh, heavens!
{29934}{29975}- He's following us.|- You think so?
{29979}{30033}You have all the luck.|He's loaded!
{30037}{30082}He's a wonderful dancer.
{30086}{30117}Come on.
{30738}{30778}I've got a pebble in my shoe.
{30782}{30828}You do not.|Look, you got your way.
{30832}{30882}I did it for you.
{30886}{30936}Would you like|to become a dancer, miss?
{30940}{31000}- Everyone knows what that means.|- She's my daughter.
{31004}{31045}I'm very interested in her, madame.
{31049}{31098}My daughter is an honest girl.
{31102}{31167}I don't doubt it.|What does she earn working for you?
{31184}{31214}She's not for sale.
{31218}{31259}I want to give her a career.
{31263}{31335}She already has one.|What kind of career?
{31339}{31422}The finest of all, dear lady.|The theater.
{31426}{31491}But there's nothing I can do.
{31495}{31529}We'll teach you.
{31548}{31597}And don't suck your thumb.
{31635}{31676}What would you pay her?
{31693}{31774}Three francs in training,|100 sous when she appears on stage.
{31778}{31828}A hundred sous! What luck.
{31832}{31886}A hundred sous?|When does she start?
{31890}{31938}- At once, if you like.|- She must finish the day.
{31942}{31994}Then I'll call for her tonight.
{31998}{32034}All very well,
{32038}{32085}but how do I know you're serious?
{32089}{32126}Here's an advance.
{32130}{32181}Hold it right there.|I've got a say in this.
{32185}{32243}What's your name|and where will you have me dance?
{32262}{32296}My name's Danglard.
{32300}{32378}At the moment I'm running|the Chinese Screen.
{32382}{32482}And by tomorrow I might -|well, that's another story.
{32499}{32546}So, shall I come for you later?
{32583}{32621}Good-bye.
{32625}{32690}The pleats in this blouse|are a disgrace.
{32694}{32753}How's the pleat in your backside?
{33194}{33247}It's expected among theater people.
{33251}{33303}You have to do it|or you get nowhere.
{33309}{33389}- That's what bothers me.|- If I were in your shoes -
{33394}{33474}I always dreamed that Paulo|would be the first.
{33480}{33524}I'm afraid of looking foolish|with Danglard.
{33530}{33599}You've still got time|to take a lesson before tonight.
{33603}{33653}Listen to you!
{34362}{34432}- Where's your uncle?|- Asleep upstairs.
{35135}{35209}My little Nini,|now you're my wife.
{35213}{35265}It's nothing to cry about.
{35270}{35329}I'm not crying.|I'm just happy.
{35726}{35780}Come on.|No need to be frightened.
{36136}{36178}Say olי with more passion.
{36374}{36416}Where are we?
{36420}{36474}At Guibole's, your teacher.
{36478}{36535}Then this is really about dancing?
{36539}{36573}What did you think?
{36577}{36631}Well, I thought I'd have to -
{36674}{36744}It's not like that anymore.|You're behind the times.
{36748}{36779}A pupil?
{36783}{36839}Better. An idea.
{36843}{36921}Let's see your idea.|Come into the light, child.
{37086}{37144}- I'm not a freak animal.|- I do the talking here.
{37204}{37250}What do you want to make of her?
{37254}{37294}You'll be astonished.
{37300}{37357}Remember your cancan triumphs?
{37361}{37402}Is that your idea?
{37406}{37509}Yes, and not just for her.|For all your girls, and others besides.
{37513}{37553}You've lost your marbles.
{37557}{37587}No, I haven't.
{37593}{37710}Imagine a line of pretty girls|in fancy dress with faces like this one.
{37714}{37819}The cancan is dead.|What could she do with it now?
{37823}{37881}Why not a minuet?
{37904}{37954}We'll find a new name for it.
{37958}{38022}They only go for English names now.
{38026}{38104}Macadam, Macfarlan,|Pickpocket, Lavatory.
{38108}{38162}Poor old cancan.
{38189}{38223}French Cancan.
{38249}{38286}Not bad.
{38290}{38401}The only thing is, these kids|will never be able to do this.
{38405}{38445}My gosh!
{38482}{38537}Only you can revive|the cancan, Guibole.
{38543}{38599}- Oh, stop.|- I'm serious. Play, Oscar.
{39180}{39265}Quiet down!|I can't sleep with all that racket!
{39269}{39309}Shut your trap, philistine!
{39329}{39363}Help me up.
{39394}{39446}Off with you.
{39450}{39502}Isn't this better than washing clothes?
{39506}{39580}- Yes, but I'll never manage it.|- Sit down.
{39714}{39744}Sit still.
{39887}{39929}It's not funny!
{39933}{39989}- She's flexible.|- So you'll start tomorrow?
{39994}{40056}- Be here at 8:00 a. m.|- Yes, madame.
{40060}{40094}Good night.
{40498}{40536}Hello, Danglard.
{40540}{40610}Look at the pretty ribbon I found.
{40614}{40671}Vanity will be your downfall.
{40675}{40729}And you'll always be a prince.
{40882}{40918}Do you know her?
{40924}{40963}That's Prunelle, Queen of the Cancan.
{40969}{41023}The toast of Paris|before you were born.
{41092}{41150}- Good night, Monsieur Danglard.|- Night, sweetheart.
{41278}{41317}I was down in the dumps.
{41323}{41433}But seeing her skip|along the street was a revelation.
{41437}{41496}Do you know what I'll give them?
{41502}{41608}A taste of the low life for millionaires.|Adventure in comfort.
{41612}{41736}Garden tables, the best champagne,|great numbers by the finest artistes.
{41742}{41810}The bourgeois will be thrilled|to mix with our girls
{41816}{41867}without fear of disease|or getting knifed.
{41871}{41909}But where?
{41931}{41999}- I just bought the White Queen.|- With what?
{42005}{42132}Well, with drafts, promises,|a lot of hot air.
{42136}{42174}There's no lack of money.
{42178}{42239}It's just getting it|out of backers' pockets.
{42243}{42279}May I make a suggestion?
{42285}{42320}Just a little song.
{42326}{42408}Ancient heroes were lauded|by a chorus.
{42412}{42482}Aren't our heroes today|worthy of the luxury?
{42486}{42568}I'll be your chorus.|Nice idea, right?
{42602}{42696}# Money is as shy as a turtledove #
{42730}{42824}# Money can be wooed|like a maiden's love #
{42850}{42954}# Money hides shyly beneath widows' beds|Money mounts up in misers' heads #
{42958}{43066}# Millionaire, banker, courtesan|bigot, aristocrat, holdup man #
{43072}{43128}# There's all that money|to be shaken from trees #
{43134}{43227}# What's money for Danglard|but shooting the breeze #
{43231}{43314}# Forward! Charge the windmills #
{43366}{43400}# Soldiers, hold your positions #
{43404}{43454}# Forward! Capture the pretty frills #
{43491}{43538}# Shake the temple 's columns #
{43570}{43660}# Soldiers! Remember that from the top|of the Moulin de la Galette #
{43664}{43790}# Forty centuries look down upon you #
{43918}{43997}- Casimir, I ' m pleased with you.|- Long live the emperor!
{44070}{44168}Zizi, I bring a sinner|eager to repent.
{44243}{44317}Forgive me, but I can only|offer you the edge of my bed.
{44334}{44386}I'm punished by my own sins.
{44428}{44556}Lola has told me about your idea|of a Chinese Screen for the masses.
{44562}{44621}High life for modest purses.
{44625}{44669}The illusion of high life.
{44673}{44792}Society needs its illusionists,|so I've decided to help you.
{44798}{44841}First, I'll return your furniture.
{44845}{44901}No, I'd rather live in a hotel.
{44919}{44946}In my profession,
{44950}{45063}a home means family and such,|a luxury I can't afford.
{45067}{45107}As you wish.
{45162}{45291}I'd like to clear up certain|delicate points in our relationship.
{45322}{45376}Casimir, would you leave us?
{45433}{45474}You're not going to fight?
{45478}{45514}Don't be silly.
{45520}{45570}As you well know, my dear friend,
{45574}{45665}it wasn't jealousy|that provoked me.
{45671}{45707}I'm not jealous.
{45711}{45777}Adrien, don't you love me anymore?
{45794}{45837}Lola, I adore you.
{45862}{45925}The precarious modern world
{45944}{46001}judges by appearance only.
{46005}{46083}Respect them,|and I'll remain your supporter.
{46087}{46154}Appearances. What do I care?
{46158}{46206}I do as I please.
{46210}{46285}Yes, you can afford|to indulge yourself.
{46289}{46413}In the future, when you provoke|the resentment of our Belle Abbesse,
{46431}{46500}see that it doesn't happen in public.
{46519}{46557}Sounds like a plan.
{47010}{47087}- The Prussians!|- Fear not, dear lady. I am here!
{47115}{47177}Magnificent explosion, Baron.
{47181}{47253}- The Cossacks have arrived!|- There's no peace anymore.
{47300}{47358}- They're demolishing the White Queen.|- It's Danglard's doing.
{47362}{47513}A harmless meeting place for maids,|destroyed for Danglard's den of vice.
{47519}{47603}I won't set a foot inside.|- It's progress, Commandant.
{48374}{48450}- That's enough.|- Once more, just for me.
{48454}{48532}There's no favoritism in dance.|She'll never get it.
{48551}{48609}What do you say?|- Nothing.
{48628}{48675}Then I'll go.|Good-bye, Monsieur Danglard.
{48679}{48759}Madame Guibole.|- Good-bye, sweetheart.
{48780}{48866}After all, the laundry isn't so bad.
{48980}{49079}My friend's in a hurry.|It's their busy day at the delicatessen.
{49083}{49169}Who shall I let in,|the two gentlemen or the girl?
{49173}{49216}All three.
{49413}{49482}I'm afraid Walter|has an administrative meeting.
{49486}{49531}- What about Lola?|- The same meeting.
{49535}{49573}Administrative?
{49599}{49653}He asked me|to give you this check.
{49659}{49729}I hear you sold|the Chinese Screen. Why?
{49734}{49794}For a down payment|on the White Queen.
{49800}{49872}- Wasn't that for your old age?|- Walter is my partner.
{49876}{49977}If this flops, he'll employ me|as a messenger in one of his banks.
{49995}{50024}Any dancing experience?
{50028}{50085}No, but I was first|in my gymnastics class.
{50458}{50493}Let's give her a chance.
{50497}{50555}Report back here tomorrow.|Wear pantaloons.
{50559}{50593}Next.
{50818}{50856}I pose for painters.
{50862}{50934}'The Temptation of Saint Anthony,'
{50938}{50980}well, that's me.
{51084}{51126}Let's see what you can do.
{51263}{51331}- You haven't got it.|- What do you do with the rejects?
{51337}{51378}Do you need more mine workers?
{51382}{51474}Excellent idea.|She could do some overtime.
{51478}{51509}Not likely.
{51843}{51883}Bring us some punch.
{51889}{51917}Punch?
{51923}{51999}Do you need warming up,|my great big Coco?
{52190}{52268}- I think it's broken.|- Relax. It doesn't break.
{53032}{53077}She did the splits.
{53138}{53178}Positions, girls.
{53227}{53265}Quickly!
{53859}{53897}Behave, Adrien.
{53907}{53957}Let's go to the Comיdie Franזaise.
{54090}{54156}Madame's dress and coat.|And get the carriage ready.
{54266}{54312}Come help us.
{55022}{55093}Ladies, take your positions.
{55427}{55465}Are you pleased?
{55469}{55541}You're still rather stiff. Relax.
{55547}{55645}Now that you're warmed up,|let's take the diagonal.
{56162}{56202}My dear.
{56206}{56265}Don't speak, don't move.
{56271}{56337}I've an awful headache.
{56341}{56447}I just wanted to say I've arranged|to visit the new building.
{56490}{56544}My dress, quick!
{56583}{56645}- What about your headache?|- What headache?
{56679}{56771}What if we call it|the Palace of La Belle Abbesse?
{56777}{56841}- Admirable idea.|- Very original.
{56846}{56900}- What do you think?|- Nothing.
{56904}{56942}You hypocrites!
{56946}{57013}I suggest the Cancan Palace.
{57039}{57065}Enough!
{57071}{57119}This isn't the circus.|We're working.
{57125}{57221}Ladies and gentlemen, the establishment|will be called the Moulin Rouge.
{57227}{57313}# At the Moulin Rouge the upper crust|will drink red wine till they burst #
{57317}{57363}No, they'll drink champagne!
{57401}{57443}I love you, Nini.
{57478}{57529}I love you too, darling.
{57594}{57635}I've made great progress.
{57639}{57711}If it depended on me, Monsieur Danglard|could open the show now.
{57717}{57778}- You're not staying?|- I can't.
{57784}{57880}A government official is coming to see|how the Moulin Rouge is coming along.
{57886}{57944}We're all going to be there.
{58258}{58314}An official is coming.
{58320}{58366}An official at the Moulin Rouge?
{58370}{58416}Nothing surprises me in the Republic.
{58435}{58505}What pickings!
{58658}{58688}A government official!
{58692}{58751}Monsieur Danglard is sorry|he couldn't receive you personally.
{58755}{58797}He's up to his ears in work.
{58861}{58895}Hi, Nini.
{58999}{59045}What a squadron!
{59049}{59103}They're taking the bread|from our mouths.
{59170}{59216}Watch your step, sir.
{59406}{59456}- Honored.|- How are you, Gustave?
{59460}{59534}Are you a patron of the arts, Walter?
{59538}{59623}May I present Lola de Castro|de la Puente y de Extremadura?
{59627}{59713}Honored, madame.|I greatly admire your choreography.
{59739}{59817}Thank you.|I adore compliments.
{60886}{60954}I've seen you somewhere before.
{60960}{61034}It was here, madame,|when it was the White Queen.
{61222}{61254}Why are you here?
{61258}{61300}I dance the French Cancan.
{61306}{61360}- Did Danglard hire you?|- Yes, madame.
{61509}{61558}Not in front of the minister.
{61562}{61619}Thank you for coming, Gustave.
{61623}{61665}Good-bye, sir.
{62028}{62092}- She's gone crazy.|- What did you do to her?
{62267}{62318}Get a hold of yourself!
{62324}{62426}So you wouldn't see her again.|You didn't know her name! Hypocrite!
{62474}{62510}Lola!
{62514}{62566}You want to dance the cancan?|Let's see!
{62849}{62881}Leave me alone!
{62886}{62932}I love your impulsiveness,|but is this the place?
{62936}{62994}You should have punished that girl.
{62998}{63039}- That's not my role.|- I don't understand.
{63043}{63097}Quiet! Get me my salts.
{63419}{63490}- I'll go get a doctor.|- Hurry.
{63541}{63579}She's not dead?
{63653}{63719}The boss is lifting your girl's skirts.
{63794}{63834}Does that hurt?
{63840}{63884}You're a brave little soldier.
{63890}{63943}Hey, that's my wife!
{63949}{64029}Your wife? Where did you marry her?|On a street corner?
{64034}{64078}I'll slap you silly!
{64084}{64132}Take care of him.
{64232}{64282}- She'll pay for this!|- Your leg!
{64286}{64325}Let me go!
{64541}{64583}Nini, that will do.
{64625}{64670}No scandal, I warned you.
{64674}{64759}If our lovely lady has crippled Nini,|I'll break your jaw.
{65238}{65308}Next number, gentlemen.|'Butterflies and Violets.'
{65478}{65513}What about us?
{65825}{65882}- Excuse me, sir.|- Don't mention it.
{65886}{65933}I love hand-to-hand combat.
{66302}{66347}This is really absurd.
{66351}{66396}Let's put an end to this.
{66521}{66561}Nini, that's enough.
{66566}{66601}You too, Lola.
{66606}{66663}That's enough!
{66694}{66754}This was supposed to be|a friendly meeting.
{66758}{66796}A family gathering.
{66800}{66890}We all belong|to the Moulin Rouge family.
{66894}{66934}Not again!
{67330}{67372}Are you satisfied?
{67397}{67437}What's going on here?
{67446}{67504}The girl's lover|pushed Danglard in the pit.
{67508}{67546}That's a lie!
{67558}{67628}- Come with me.|- Let me through.
{67829}{67917}- Hold on there.|- We haven't done anything.
{67922}{67982}- Take them in.|- Is this justice?
{67988}{68058}- He didn't do anything.|- Calm down or we'll arrest you too.
{68062}{68107}- What's this?|- A souvenir from my mother.
{68111}{68165}- And this one?|- From my grandmother.
{68329}{68375}Quick, doctor, over here!
{68465}{68534}- I'm so happy you're all right.|- Leave me alone!
{68550}{68621}- Forgive me.|- I never want to see you again!
{69025}{69077}Are you family?|Congratulations.
{69082}{69141}A nice fracture.|Forty days out of action.
{69415}{69457}The neighborhood's quieted down.
{69462}{69506}Like the days of the White Queen.
{69510}{69549}Danglard's not beaten yet.
{69555}{69603}He'll never find another backer.
{69607}{69653}His star's on the wane.
{69778}{69828}What are you doing here?
{69879}{69923}It's good to see you're better.
{69929}{70005}I want a word with you, in fact.|- I'm listening.
{70014}{70144}Don't get upset, but the last payment|for the White Queen was outstanding.
{70148}{70224}- I was in the hospital.|- Still, business is business.
{70230}{70321}I've got enormous commitments.
{70327}{70389}- To fish!|- No, to my family.
{70393}{70470}My son's going to the polytechnic|and my daughter to the conservatory.
{70490}{70560}I've been forced to accept|a most tempting offer.
{70564}{70600}From whom?
{70606}{70664}I've been asked not to reveal that.
{70697}{70811}Well, neither of us has|any more business here.
{70850}{70887}Congratulations.
{70967}{71020}There's Madame Prunelle.
{71026}{71084}So, you're gathering up the leftovers.
{71098}{71161}You'll come out all right.|You're a prince.
{71326}{71376}Lend me a louis, will you?
{71533}{71575}May I see that?
{71615}{71669}I know that perfume.|May I have it?
{71673}{71713}My pleasure.
{72375}{72418}What are your conditions?
{72432}{72521}No more cancan|and everything as it used to be.
{72582}{72674}Much too high a price.|My means no longer permit such folly.
{72678}{72722}You lout!
{73067}{73111}Monsieur Danglard,|may I have a word?
{73115}{73170}- Certainly.|- In private.
{73186}{73224}Will you excuse me?
{73235}{73278}We're very upset.
{73282}{73388}I've never been|in such an embarrassing situation.
{73394}{73476}Such an old customer and friend -
{73482}{73532}You have to take my room.
{73624}{73672}The gentleman looked most upset.
{73678}{73713}He's got money troubles.
{73719}{73766}He looked like he was at a wake.
{73850}{73908}- Well, good-bye.|- I've plenty of time.
{74269}{74349}When might I take the luggage,|Monsieur Danglard?
{74355}{74401}You might take it|whenever you wish.
{74499}{74559}Cheer up, my friends.
{74726}{74766}I'm sure it must be a wake.
{74795}{74865}What's all this about luggage?|Are you leaving?
{74882}{74931}When you're a big star,
{74937}{75052}you'll discover that hotel managers|suffer from a painful lack of cultivation.
{75056}{75095}You didn't pay for your room?
{75120}{75161}I can't hide anything from you.
{75183}{75223}Off you go now.
{75229}{75307}They're throwing us out, boss.|Where will we go?
{75311}{75405}Well, there are plenty of bridges|over the Seine.
{75411}{75454}- Wait for us at Guibole's.|- Really?
{75496}{75584}What a tragedy.|Matter triumphs over mind.
{75606}{75711}If I were a poet,|I'd write a poem entitled
{75715}{75762}'Soliloquy of the Homeless.'
{75768}{75803}You've got it all wrong.
{75834}{75869}# Once upon a time #
{75920}{75956}# Once upon a time #
{75962}{76037}# There sat a big, fat|Persian pussycat #
{76043}{76125}# Then the concierge gave the cat #
{76130}{76234}# Then the concierge gave the cat|a really pretty little rat #
{76240}{76313}# Little rats are tasty fare #
{76382}{76442}# In hotel rooms|to be crunched up rare #
{76570}{76613}Haven't you gone yet?
{76663}{76757}You'd better go.|I have packing to do.
{77005}{77033}What is it?
{77038}{77079}Waiter, some champagne.
{77083}{77141}- What's gotten into you?|- I wasn't speaking to you, sir.
{77182}{77216}Your best.
{77350}{77433}- Silly girl.|- I forbid you to laugh.
{78337}{78445}I'd never have thought I'd make love|and drink champagne in a chic hotel.
{78449}{78537}If someone told me|I'd fall so in love with a little laundress
{78546}{78621}that I'd feel like a king|when I ought to feel most desperate,
{78626}{78669}I'd be pretty surprised too.
{78731}{78776}A little champagne?
{78838}{78897}Before being Danglard,|what were you?
{79157}{79193}A waiter in a cafי.
{79224}{79268}Please. A sommelier.
{79363}{79465}Lola, I've waited two years|for this moment.
{79471}{79550}Two years ago -|even a few days ago -
{79554}{79643}I wanted for nothing.|You didn't even exist.
{79647}{79694}So this has all been out of spite?
{79770}{79807}And despair.
{80666}{80725}- Good day, Titi.|- Hello, Thיrese.
{80738}{80783}- Enjoy your meal.|- You too.
{80960}{81014}- Discard.|- I'll take that.
{81056}{81089}Lunch!
{81220}{81274}Sorry, but it's all I could get.
{81280}{81343}Good thing you kept your job|at the cafeteria.
{81347}{81406}Monsieur Danglard.|Madame Guibole.
{81413}{81472}- Delicious.|- lnedible!
{81476}{81523}- 'When the pelican -'|- Can it!
{81834}{81889}Hello, Paulo.|Sun feel good outside?
{81893}{81938}What feels good is finding you.
{82044}{82108}Act 3, Scene 4:|Enter the avenger.
{82114}{82151}# You're breaking my heart #
{82155}{82184}Don't mock me.
{82188}{82257}I'm not mocking you.|Your timing's perfect.
{82261}{82313}I had no idea how to make my exit.
{82329}{82371}The window? I hate heights.
{82375}{82427}A revolver? Too noisy.
{82444}{82487}The gas? Disconnected.
{82491}{82530}I do apologize.
{82546}{82575}So that's where it stands?
{82579}{82625}He catches on quickly.
{82718}{82808}- Keep out of it, the rest of you!|- Go on. You're doing me a favor.
{82834}{82873}You're too cowardly|to do it yourself.
{82877}{82917}That's right.
{82923}{82953}Don't count on me.
{82957}{82992}Then I'll finish my lunch.
{83031}{83064}Where's Nini?
{83085}{83116}Eating at her mother's.
{83120}{83144}I'll go there.
{83161}{83184}As you like.
{83206}{83256}No, I won't go.|I know Nini.
{83260}{83321}You've got a strong hand now|because you're down and out.
{83325}{83408}But when you get back|on your feet, I'll be waiting.
{83456}{83530}You ladies tell Nini that|whenever and wherever she likes,
{83536}{83575}I'll be waiting for her.
{83942}{83996}- What a brute!|- He's berserk.
{84000}{84045}What do you expect|after two months in jail?
{84049}{84117}- Think he has a knife?|- Nini had better watch out.
{84122}{84176}He'll leave her alone.|He got the picture.
{84180}{84210}Let me listen.
{84469}{84516}Isn't that a pretty voice?
{84625}{84735}# The steps up the hill #
{84739}{84776}# Are steep for the lovelorn #
{84782}{84908}But the windmills' sails|shield lovers from the storm #
{84940}{85038}# Princess of the street|your welcome is sweet #
{85042}{85102}# In my wounded heart #
{85176}{85248}Sure you're not afraid|to go out alone?
{85254}{85283}Are you kidding?
{85287}{85358}- You know Paolo's not very happy.|- Neither am I.
{85389}{85427}Don't take the Camembert again.
{85522}{85548}Good-bye, Mother.
{85582}{85609}Thיrese.
{85613}{85651}Have you got the Camembert?
{85670}{85700}Where did it go?
{85704}{85758}- I don't even like Camembert.|- Neither do I.
{85764}{85801}I'll slap all of you!
{85844}{85901}- I've come for my blouse.|- It's not ready.
{85969}{86025}- I was frightened.|- Of me?
{86050}{86079}Of someone else?
{86103}{86137}What are you doing here?
{86141}{86181}Waiting for you.
{86186}{86238}I've decided to wait|for you my whole life.
{86244}{86292}- Here?|- Anywhere.
{86309}{86352}What lovely roses!
{86401}{86460}It's so trite, bringing|roses to a young lady
{86483}{86532}but what I have to say|is so important,
{86538}{86595}I was afraid I couldn't|say it right off,
{86614}{86664}so I brought roses to -
{86669}{86709}To break the ice.
{86726}{86804}But now that I see you,|I want to plunge right in
{86826}{86864}and speak to you seriously.
{86870}{86935}I have to get to dance class|or Guibole will scold me.
{86941}{87017}I'll talk to her.|She seems like a nice lady.
{87055}{87129}Shall we sit|on the grass up there?
{87135}{87172}- You know it?|- Yes.
{87207}{87274}Allow me to dream|that I'm the boy next door
{87289}{87353}taking the girl next door out|for the first time.
{87791}{87872}It's so beautiful here.|May I sit down?
{87878}{87914}How polite you are.
{87918}{87962}Too polite for a boy next door?
{87999}{88036}So there's a big gap between us?
{88054}{88122}Miles.|Prince, listen to me.
{88128}{88195}Let me say|something important first.
{88201}{88259}I've never been in love,|and I'll never love again.
{88263}{88310}You are the love of my life.
{88331}{88353}One more thing.
{88376}{88415}Ask whatever you want of me.
{88419}{88483}I can give you so much.
{88489}{88534}Want to be my country's princess?
{88540}{88590}It is not very rich,|but it is nice.
{88594}{88685}No steel or coal.|Just sheep, tobacco and roses.
{88724}{88811}We'll get married in the capital.|Archbishop Alexis will bless our union.
{88815}{88861}The archbishop?
{88950}{89026}If you prefer to stay here,|I'll make you queen of Paris.
{89030}{89086}I'll cover you in jewels|and build you a palace.
{89155}{89251}You're sweet, you're handsome|and you're rich.
{89257}{89294}All a girl could want.
{89300}{89342}I wish I could love you,
{89346}{89428}and for that I wouldn't need|an archbishop or a palace.
{89444}{89485}But I can't love you.
{89515}{89545}The baker boy?
{89569}{89600}Is it him?
{89626}{89661}Yes, it's him.
{89724}{89777}You can't be dancer and bakery girl,
{89783}{89851}but princess and dancer you can be.
{89870}{89906}I won't be a dancer.
{89910}{89968}What about the lesson|you were rushing off to?
{89984}{90045}There's no more dance class,|and no more Moulin Rouge.
{90051}{90102}La Belle Abbesse has bought the site.
{90106}{90155}Things might be arranged.
{90161}{90189}The land is expensive.
{90193}{90237}If it's only money, it's yours.
{90276}{90347}I couldn't.|I'd hate myself.
{90351}{90424}Nini, don't make me suffer.
{90448}{90481}My life is at stake.
{90485}{90559}Your life?|Now you're joking with me.
{90563}{90604}Do I look like I am?
{90636}{90691}Not really.|That's what upsets me.
{90731}{90781}Life is not as simple|as it seems.
{91099}{91156}They've started work again.|We're done for.
{91161}{91212}Seems a prince bought the site
{91218}{91280}and is giving Danglard whatever|he needs for his Moulin Rouge.
{91286}{91335}All for the love of a dancer.
{91341}{91381}Ah, love.
{91656}{91709}A real song of the streets.
{92019}{92063}- I need the piano.|- Take it.
{92067}{92107}Use a little less vibrato,
{92111}{92170}and flash those pretty eyes|of yours around.
{92176}{92242}- We have to rehearse.|- Take it. You come with me.
{92246}{92297}You don't realize, madame.
{92301}{92406}The slightest interruption or noise|and my inspiration vanishes.
{92412}{92466}- Dance class.|- Right away.
{92470}{92513}No one understands artistes.
{93290}{93337}What are you waiting for?
{93343}{93377}My foot hurts.
{93525}{93604}- Is she here?|- Every day, just like me.
{93609}{93641}And you have no suspicions?
{93645}{93726}All lovers have suspicions.|I try to hide mine.
{93732}{93777}Has she told you|she loves Paulo?
{93781}{93808}She has.
{93826}{93885}You haven't noticed anything|between her and Danglard?
{93889}{93956}Just the usual intimacy|among artists.
{94102}{94201}You're blind, my friend.|Let's see if you're deaf too.
{94231}{94301}Nini, come here.|- I'll come if I please.
{94305}{94349}Don't interrupt work, Lola.
{94353}{94417}I intend to interrupt|more than work.
{94709}{94742}Hurry, boss!
{94848}{94889}What do you want?
{94895}{94937}First, to congratulate you.
{94942}{94997}You're doing well for a beginner.
{95026}{95056}You came to say that?
{95060}{95109}No, and you know it.
{95152}{95217}Maybe it's better this way.
{95222}{95268}I've been meaning|to tell you, Alexandre.
{95272}{95310}I just didn't know how.
{95324}{95364}I'm a bad girl.
{95368}{95449}And you're so kind,|I can't bear to hurt you.
{95509}{95541}Then it's true?
{95574}{95610}Yes, it's true.
{95616}{95697}I'm his mistress,|and I'm proud of it.
{95851}{95915}- Come now, little one.|- Leave me alone, Oscar!
{95919}{95959}All right, all right.
{96202}{96281}I'm so sorry,|but the operation was necessary.
{96286}{96367}Dear madame, may I ask|yet another favor of you?
{96373}{96404}Beat it!
{96411}{96449}Your French is improving.
{96455}{96571}A few more such adventures|and you'll be a true Parisian!
{96677}{96717}You have something|to say to me?
{96721}{96813}Just that you're the queen of the shrews|and you'll always have a spot in my show.
{96819}{96882}My poor darling. Your show!
{96898}{96920}Class is over.
{96924}{96969}Get dressed, girls.
{97225}{97308}Prince Alex, when you're free,|remember me.
{97526}{97577}What did she do to you?
{98933}{99053}Special edition! Prince Alexandre|hovering between life and death!
{99432}{99489}- Another foreigner.|- Can't do without 'em.
{99530}{99553}Poor Alexandre.
{99559}{99621}- It's really most upsetting.|- lndeed.
{99654}{99696}Let me finish my story.
{99703}{99781}After he stitched her up, the surgeon|realized he'd lost his monocle.
{99802}{99882}And you know where?|Stitched up inside my poor mother.
{99905}{99939}Be quiet.
{99943}{100032}This isn't the time for jokes.|We're not at the White Queen.
{100036}{100116}I make jokes when and where I wish.|Once I leave the office -
{100121}{100233}I know: 'Curtains.'|But you are a symbol of our class.
{100237}{100335}Appearances are all|that can save us.
{100341}{100381}That's called hypocrisy.
{100387}{100441}- I admit it.|- You're a gloomy sort.
{100446}{100492}Of course. Poor Alexandre.
{100496}{100549}Ah, yes. A remarkable chap.
{100554}{100608}- A considerable fortune.|- A future king.
{100612}{100686}- A real gentleman.|- Descended from Mahomet Ali.
{100690}{100737}Have you wailing women|finished your act?
{100751}{100867}To think this is my fault!|I'm disgusted with myself!
{100871}{100916}- My dear!|- What a sensitive heart!
{100957}{101069}Our little spat is pure vanity.|Nothing but hot air.
{101073}{101135}After what I've done,|you might not believe this,
{101141}{101185}but I'll say it anyway.
{101189}{101242}If things work out,|I'll join you again.
{101271}{101308}I owe it to Alexandre.
{101325}{101397}Nini, I'd be happy|to have you as my friend.
{101401}{101467}I hope you'll be happy|with Danglard.
{101471}{101533}I can never be happy again.
{101537}{101577}Don't be angry with me.
{101581}{101657}When I'm in a rage,|I don't know what I'm doing.
{101661}{101693}I'm not angry with you.
{101700}{101793}Who could resist such|a scene of burgeoning friendship?
{101799}{101925}Danglard, let's forget our quarrels.|If you need a backer, I'm your man.
{101942}{102004}Have you turned into a statue?
{102008}{102061}So we move ahead|with the Moulin Rouge?
{102065}{102134}Miracles never cease.|Barjelin has understood.
{102140}{102205}I have faith in miracles,|but not in surgeons.
{102209}{102275}Suppose Alexandre dies.
{102285}{102328}His father, the king,|inherits the Moulin Rouge.
{102332}{102390}He presents it to the archbishop,|who turns it into a convent,
{102396}{102442}and it's curtains for our cancan.
{102448}{102553}If I were Danglard,|I'd recover the deeds to the site.
{102559}{102608}And I know who|I'd send on that mission.
{102617}{102676}Think of your pals, Nini.
{102681}{102717}Don't count on me.
{102798}{102833}An unremarkable case.
{102873}{102956}The top surgeons aren't interested.|He's saved!
{102961}{103013}The patient is asking for|Mademoiselle Nini.
{103401}{103453}- Does it hurt?|- Not even that.
{103479}{103525}I've always been clumsy.
{103554}{103605}I've not only been clumsy,|I've been -
{103609}{103633}What?
{103669}{103700}Nothing.
{103732}{103778}Allow me|to be less modest than you.
{103796}{103893}What do you think of my little|demonstration? Not bad, eh?
{103897}{103957}Alex, you're so much better|than the rest of us.
{103961}{104051}No better, no worse.|Just different.
{104066}{104131}Animals in the jungle|keep to their own species.
{104143}{104192}They don't mingle,|under pain of death.
{104202}{104306}I stuck my nose where I shouldn't have,|but I survived. I was lucky.
{104313}{104352}How well you talk.
{104366}{104406}Will you give me a present?
{104410}{104433}A present? Me?
{104539}{104648}Before I leave, give me|a make-believe memory of Paris.
{104673}{104749}Let me pretend for one evening|that I'm the boy next door
{104779}{104822}taking you out|for the first time,
{104834}{104881}and that you allow him to love you
{104885}{104921}in silence.
{104945}{104984}When I'm old,
{105000}{105108}I'll dazzle the younger generations|with my wonderful Parisian romance.
{105149}{105214}- Where shall we go?|- Everywhere.
{105727}{105843}# Madame Arthur|set tongues wagging for so long #
{105849}{105902}# She'd no need of newspapers|or advertisements #
{105906}{105951}# To entertain an army of lovers #
{105955}{106049}# Madame Arthur|set tongues wagging for so long #
{106062}{106136}# You should have seen her dance #
{106143}{106215}# With all her charm #
{106257}{106313}# And yet I love you #
{106317}{106415}# And yet I love you #
{106440}{106557}# But you drove me crazy #
{106561}{106650}# And set me wandering the globe #
{106718}{106768}- Lovely, isn't it?|- Yes.
{106772}{106900}# So much grief embedded #
{106924}{107001}# In my poor wandering soul #
{107058}{107180}# You who pass|through this arbor #
{107185}{107241}# Come in and drink #
{107251}{107323}# Drink, young soldiers #
{107329}{107426}# Drink the wine of victory #
{107432}{107557}# You ruby-red rascal|Unequaled nectar #
{107561}{107671}You fill our hearts with courage #
{107677}{107761}# O wine of hope #
{107767}{107905}# Drink, my friends|this victory wine #
{107977}{108060}# Be kind, unknown lady #
{108066}{108129}# For whom I've so often sung #
{108151}{108240}# Any small offering is welcome #
{108244}{108309}# Please give what you can #
{108314}{108392}# Be kind, unknown lady #
{108398}{108468}# For whom I've so often sung #
{108472}{108537}# I welcome you always #
{108542}{108645}# O unknown lady #
{109121}{109192}Good-bye, Alex.|You'll soon forget me.
{109198}{109261}- This is just a story for youngsters.|- Yes, Grandmother.
{109265}{109301}Don't rub it in.
{109307}{109385}I feel like I've aged ten years|since I left the laundry.
{109389}{109503}We're both veterans of that famous|campaign called the Moulin Rouge.
{109527}{109565}Let's kiss before we part
{109591}{109625}as veterans do.
{109748}{109782}Good-bye, Alex.
{109817}{109853}One more thing.
{109886}{109941}I'm going home|to a difficult profession.
{109961}{110055}Here I am, incapable of managing|my own little affairs
{110075}{110140}and one day|I must lead millions.
{110144}{110198}Tobacco, sheep and roses.
{110242}{110329}No more roses -|they were reserved for you.
{110404}{110510}I ask you to accept the only heart|I can still offer.
{110635}{110690}It's too beautiful.|I'll never dare wear it.
{110694}{110725}Mere pebbles.
{110749}{110791}One soon gets used to them.
{110883}{110972}I almost forgot.|I think you'll find these useful.
{111003}{111064}The deeds to the Moulin Rouge.
{111097}{111163}I've put them in Danglard's name -|it's simplest.
{111654}{111678}Evening, Paolo.
{111682}{111717}Let me by!
{111723}{111822}You can't say I've bothered you|since I got out of jail.
{111826}{111874}Prunelle is dead drunk.
{111880}{111956}Me too.|We've both drowned our sorrows.
{111961}{111991}Poor old woman.
{111997}{112104}Have you really forgotten|all about me and the bakery?
{112137}{112189}My uncle's retiring.|I'll be the boss.
{112220}{112304}We could go out on Sundays|and take vacations in the country.
{112335}{112358}Of course.
{112389}{112428}We could have children.
{112461}{112512}We could have been|happy together,
{112518}{112579}but I'm not the same Nini anymore,|my poor Paulo.
{112597}{112644}You'll do fine as you are.
{112669}{112737}But after your debut,|it'll be another story.
{112743}{112849}I don't want a wife who gives herself|to thousands every night.
{112853}{112893}Sorry. I've made my choice.
{112897}{112985}You'll end up like Prunelle|when Danglard doesn't need you anymore.
{112989}{113056}- He'll never leave me.|- Think about it.
{113061}{113157}The moment you appear in public,|you've lost me.
{113842}{113870}Amיdי!
{114051}{114091}Hurry.|I want to see Nini dance.
{114097}{114153}- Why not the pope?|- He doesn't dance.
{114183}{114255}We must be mad|to pay to see Nini's thighs.
{114259}{114308}- Is she the one who shot the prince?|- ldiot!
{114313}{114376}A person who commits suicide|shoots himself!
{114382}{114451}- His father's a king.|- They're called czars.
{114457}{114527}She had a jailbird boyfriend, too.
{114541}{114587}We could well see bloodshed tonight.
{114591}{114639}Then let's leave.|I don't like dramas.
{114643}{114702}Stars don't have dramas,|only scandals.
{114854}{114903}No luck. I give up.
{114909}{114995}- Shall we see Nini?|- Mustn't be left out.
{115014}{115064}They messed up my dress.|It has to be redone.
{115068}{115128}It doesn't matter. Put it on!
{115200}{115321}The solo violin kills my act.|It's the violin or me. Make your choice.
{115345}{115391}Get out of here!
{115395}{115459}Copper's crashed in New York!|We're ruined.
{115492}{115556}That carpet should have been|down an hour ago.
{115561}{115604}- You told us to buy.|- It's your fault.
{115608}{115638}Am I your keeper?
{115642}{115690}Lend me a hand with that carpet.
{116203}{116289}- This better be a success.|- Have we got much money in this?
{116295}{116380}Rest assured, the Moulin Rouge|will profit us more than it will Danglard.
{116430}{116544}Thank you, but hold your applause|until you've seen the show.
{116548}{116651}I see several uniforms|of the Russian navy.
{116851}{116982}Doubtless men from the 'Prince Orlof',|now anchored at Brest.
{117004}{117053}It's my pleasure to tell|these fine sailors
{117059}{117151}that Catherine,|Empress of all the Russias,
{117157}{117223}in celebration of|the Franco-Russian alliance...
{117323}{117382}has come to review the troops|of the Moulin Rouge.
{117386}{117460}So we've rallied our troupe|to honor her.
{117465}{117532}Catherine's been dead a century,|you'll say.
{117537}{117651}But we here at the Moulin Rouge|attach no importance to such details.
{118092}{118193}# Catherine the Great|had a hearty appetite #
{118197}{118284}# Her mouth began to water|when a real man came in sight #
{118288}{118413}# To the strains of balalaikas|there was a scuffling midst begonias #
{118417}{118536}# But if passion ran colder, it was|'Throw him in the Volga!' #
{118552}{118633}# Our stalwart grenadiers|are on the march #
{118637}{118766}# Now the ladies applaud|their bayonet charge #
{118770}{118915}# But as Queen Hortensia remarked|as a palace ball progressed #
{118919}{118998}# 'In their uniforms so vast #
{119002}{119127}# One has to guess the rest'#
{119713}{119743}Long live the empress!
{120198}{120283}# But as Queen Hortensia remarked #
{120297}{120408}# 'One has to guess the rest' #
{121645}{121688}Casimir, go introduce Esther.
{121692}{121733}Right, boss.
{121865}{121957}Remember, every man in the audience|must believe you sing for him alone.
{121963}{122018}Understand? Now go on.
{122024}{122067}Go and work the door.
{122997}{123036}Did you like that?
{123097}{123143}Now we invite you to breathe in
{123149}{123222}the scent of a little flower|from the streets of Montmartre.
{123226}{123297}Our newest star: Esther Georges.
{123466}{123522}# Above the rue Saint Vincent #
{123526}{123605}# A poet and an unknown girl #
{123609}{123687}# Loved for a brief moment #
{123691}{123765}# And never met again #
{123790}{123934}# Hoping the waif would hear it|for her he wrote this song #
{123952}{124052}# As she wandered the streets #
{124056}{124173}# One morning in spring #
{124259}{124369}# The waning moon|shimmering down #
{124373}{124442}# Crowns your gold hair #
{124487}{124593}# The gilded moon|with glory festoons #
{124597}{124666}# Your petticoat bare #
{124710}{124764}# The pallid moon #
{124768}{124874}# Starkly outlines|your tired opal eyes #
{124938}{125042}# Princess of the street|your welcome is sweet #
{125046}{125125}# In my wounded heart #
{125146}{125274}# The steps up the hill #
{125278}{125362}# Are steep for the lovelorn #
{125368}{125517}# But the windmills ' sails|shield lovers from the storm #
{125585}{125633}# Little waif #
{125637}{125738}# I feel your small hand|searching for mine #
{125808}{125918}# I feel your heart beat|your waist so neat
{125922}{125974}# My sorrows decline #
{126031}{126145}# Yet your lips betray, feverishly #
{126149}{126193}# The hunger of years #
{126265}{126352}# At your touch I feel a rush #
{126376}{126426}# That brings me to tears #
{126479}{126607}# The steps up the hill #
{126611}{126691}# Are steep for the lovelorn #
{126695}{126770}# But the windmills ' sails #
{126774}{126841}# Shield lovers from the storm #
{126913}{126961}# But now the rain drips #
{126965}{127020}# The moon in eclipse #
{127024}{127084}# My princess has gone #
{127141}{127262}# A sky without moon|I sing forlorn #
{127266}{127370}# In search of my dream #
{127699}{127741}- Go and announce Roberto.|- Again?
{127862}{127923}I work in a mortuary.|I should be used to tears!
{128073}{128190}And now, the Great Roberto,|the famous whistler.
{128196}{128280}The soul of a poet,|the whistle of a blackbird!
{128617}{128679}I owe it all to you.|I'll never leave you.
{128787}{128821}Go now, little sparrow.
{128825}{128869}Don't mind me!
{129142}{129185}Open the door, Nini.
{129198}{129241}I order you to open this door.
{129273}{129345}- Do the cancan without me.|- You've got some timing!
{129496}{129543}- Where's Nini?|- She doesn't want to dance.
{129547}{129586}Is she crazy?|She'll ruin everything.
{129592}{129644}- I'm so sorry.|- Go find Casimir.
{129650}{129710}- What's going on?|- Nini's letting us down.
{129714}{129772}Did you cheat on her with Esther?
{129776}{129825}You should be ashamed.|A nice girl like Nini?
{129829}{129903}I could slap you!|- Don't start again!
{129907}{129956}All ready for the cancan?
{129960}{130001}No, keep them happy|with the band.
{130063}{130113}We'll have to cut down|the number of dancers.
{130117}{130174}Never!|You'll take Nini's place.
{130178}{130221}Are you crazy?|With this mug?
{130225}{130254}What about it?
{130258}{130309}I knew it in the old days.
{130313}{130368}You knew the chahut,|not the French cancan.
{130373}{130467}There's a big difference.|Still, you could fill a gap.
{130847}{130964}We beg for your patience while|waiting for the French Cancan.
{131115}{131240}To clear the floor, those who must move|can come and sit on the stage.
{131259}{131369}Maestro Oscar will entertain us|with a medley of current hits.
{132065}{132111}I'll see what's going on.
{132190}{132259}- She won't dance. She finally understood.|- What a shame!
{132453}{132491}I'm Nini's mother!
{132563}{132602}Nini, you're terrible!
{132722}{132772}- What's going on?|- Your daughter, madame.
{132793}{132835}She's being stubborn again.
{132857}{132894}Open up, Nini.
{132903}{132943}It's your mother!
{132991}{133036}I'd rather have you smack my face.
{133040}{133084}Stop being mean.
{133091}{133121}You hear that?
{133165}{133209}I'll stay on one condition.
{133243}{133283}I want Danglard all to myself.
{133289}{133368}You want to put me in a cage|like a canary?
{133373}{133410}I warn you,|it won't last long.
{133430}{133493}You couldn't stand me|after a couple of weeks.
{133522}{133563}You want the Danglard|of the theater
{133567}{133644}or Danglard who wears slippers?|I've never worn them and never will!
{133648}{133701}I'll give you some good advice.
{133705}{133779}If you want a lover,|Alexandre's perfect.
{133783}{133841}If you want a husband,|marry Paulo.
{133845}{133968}Choose between jewels and palaces|or a happy retirement by the fireside,
{133988}{134065}with honor and dignity,|but I can't give you either!
{134069}{134166}Do I look like Prince Charming?|Only one thing matters to me -
{134170}{134206}what I create.
{134210}{134271}And what do I create? You!
{134275}{134296}Her!
{134320}{134377}There have been others before.|There'll be others to come.
{134381}{134471}In the end, you think it matters|what you and I want?
{134475}{134573}All that counts is what they want.|We're at the service of the public.
{134577}{134629}You know why it breaks my heart|to see you go?
{134635}{134717}They can smash the place to pieces|for all I care!
{134721}{134767}But the profession's|losing a good trouper.
{134771}{134847}I thought you were one of us.|If not, get out!
{134923}{134977}Line up for the quadrille, girls.
{135046}{135088}Lola, get ready.
{135442}{135480}Wait, I'm coming.
{135544}{135584}Take your places for the cancan.
{135713}{135745}Your dress!
{135933}{136019}They wouldn't care about Nini|if I'd shot myself over her.
{136025}{136059}You don't think so?
{136152}{136207}- What's going on?|- Everything's fine.
{136247}{136301}- What about your introduction?|- You do it.
{136305}{136354}Me?|But Nini isn't ready.
{136358}{136415}She will be. Get going!
{136619}{136683}Ladies and gentlemen,|the French Cancan!
{137425}{137461}Would you sit down?
{137739}{137764}Hurry.
{140699}{140757}Never seen a behind before?
{145392}{145478}I have an idea.|Tomorrow I'll marry you.
{145482}{145543}- Time to put an end to everything?|- Perhaps a beginning.
{145547}{145617}The stock exchange will have|confidence in an empress's husband.
{146958}{147005}Mind stepping aside?
{147048}{147089}You're in the way.
{148415}{148476}- Still quitting?|- Are you mad?
{148565}{148604}Would you like|to go on the stage?
{148608}{148632}Oh, yes!
