00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:37,637
Now, watch this.

3
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,051
Cavin.

4
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:47,022
I thought you said that nephew of yours
was gonna be worth a damn.

5
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:51,354
Wanna see that again?

6
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,019
I'll set him straight.

7
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:05,939
This ain't no barn social.
You understand?

8
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:10,569
I spoke up for you, Sonny.
You best do right by me.

9
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,960
All right.

10
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,461
He'll do right.

11
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:41,967
All right. Let's get it done.

12
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,970
Everybody, grab the ceiling.

13
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:49,016
Just keep your damn trap shut,
nobody has to get killed.

14
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,223
Good boy.

15
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,256
Open the safe.

16
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,523
I don't know the combination.

17
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:07,499
- Cavin.
- Damn city boy.

18
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,735
Now, you wanna keep
the other nine fingers?

19
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:13,808
Open the safe.

20
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,345
Excuse me, ma'am.

21
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,283
You're Dolly Sloan, aren't you?

22
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,686
How would a green kid like you
be knowing something like that?

23
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,689
I know all about you.

24
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,491
Look, I got it in here somewhere.

25
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,431
Dime novels, huh?

26
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,432
<i>Harlot With a Heart, right here.</i>

27
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:45,300
Well, you take it from one
who's been there, boy.

28
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,136
They don't always get it right.

29
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,306
Even so, I'd be much obliged
if you'd mark my copy.

30
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,808
Company, right!

31
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,213
Coming around!

32
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,155
Maybe some other time. Hey, boys.

33
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:07,662
Well, what brings you to town today?

34
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,508
There's blue boys out there.

35
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,011
At a walk!

36
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:35,246
Company, halt!

37
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,253
Company, dismount.

38
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,861
How was your ride?

39
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,090
It was over two days.
How do you ride?

40
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,552
- Hurry up.
- Hurry, let's go.

41
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,943
Quit your squirming!

42
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,257
Cover me!

43
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,099
That's them!

44
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,170
Miss Sloan.

45
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,186
Let's ride. Come on.

46
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:18,756
Don't let me die.

47
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:43,116
- Come on!
- Wait for me.

48
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,484
Sonny!

49
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,828
Badger!

50
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:04,297
Get up! Come on! Come on!

51
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,744
Go! Get up here.

52
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,665
All right, throw those bags on Ginger.

53
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,845
- What went wrong?
- Nothing. Hell, it went real good.

54
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,951
Knox, where's the rest of them?

55
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,424
Butch went down. Waco too.
I didn't see nobody else.

56
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:04,532
Listen up, we got a hard road ahead of us.
And some of you ain't gonna make it.

57
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,294
I can ride, Blackjack.
You ain't gotta worry none.

58
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,633
Any man who can keep up with me,
I'll see in Chihuahua.

59
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:13,741
The rest of you, I'll see you in hell.

60
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,364
They're coming.

61
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,025
Let's keep pushing it.

62
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:16,330
- What about Badger?
- What about him?

63
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,666
He's hurt bad.
He's gonna need to rest.

64
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:22,299
Well, why don't we make camp
so he can have a nice long nap.

65
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,002
He's your brother.

66
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,911
Think I give a damn? We got a posse
of men behind us on fresh horses...

67
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,917
...just itching to hang us all.
- I'm all right, kid.

68
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,952
Time's a-wasting, Blackjack.

69
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:35,022
I can keep up!

70
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,826
Let's go.

71
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:23,103
Badger, give me your reins. Come on.

72
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,435
Hold on to your saddle horn.

73
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,213
I don't see any quit in them.

74
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,580
All right, we'll ride through the night.
Let's pick it up.

75
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:45,420
Yeah, we're the Blackjack Britton Gang.
Ain't a bunch a quitters here, eh, boys?

76
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,459
Let's go.

77
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,178
- Badger's down!
- Hold it up.

78
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,679
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

79
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,193
I reckon it's over for me now.

80
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:56,024
Appears so, Badger.

81
00:11:56,198 --> 00:12:00,498
Do me a last kindness, Jack, and end it.

82
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,136
I can't spare the bullet.

83
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:07,843
Cavin, will you?

84
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:15,576
- We gotta ride.
- We're just gonna leave him here like this?

85
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,810
What do you suggest, boy?

86
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,511
Well, at least wait until...

87
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,849
Until what? Until that posse rides up?

88
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:25,216
Hell, you wanna read him a prayer,
go ahead.

89
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:27,658
So long, Badger.

90
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:32,458
So long, Blackjack.

91
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,670
Let's go.

92
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,399
We're moving out. Get up.

93
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:44,342
Don't be a fool. Go with them.

94
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,310
It just ain't right.

95
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,144
Not much in life is.

96
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,354
It sure as hell ain't
like them dime novels...

97
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,516
...you got in your saddlebag, is it?

98
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:05,732
There's a way out of this
if you act quick.

99
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:15,770
I ain't never shot nobody before.

100
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,950
Maybe you're worth a damn after all.

101
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,411
I wanna go home.

102
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,252
It's a little too late for that.

103
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,594
Come on, now. Get out.

104
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,425
Come on, you hear me?

105
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,664
Sonny!

106
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:21,934
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Let's go.

107
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,343
Go! Go!

108
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,744
Son of a bitch!

109
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:40,755
Come on!

110
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:52,165
It's not worth dying for! Blackjack!

111
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,276
Blackjack!
Let's get out now! Come on!

112
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:21,683
This sure as hell ain't Mexico.

113
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,713
Winds must have got us turned around.

114
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,177
Let's move it.

115
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,180
It must go somewhere.

116
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,581
Anywhere's better than where we been.

117
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:03,885
All right, we're heading out.
Let's keep a sharp eye.

118
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,759
It looks like we got us
a town up ahead.

119
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:49,427
So ride in nice and easy.
And be ready for anything.

120
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,033
Oh, my, would you look at that.

121
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,131
I think I'm gonna like this town.

122
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,334
Keep your mind on business.

123
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,711
Here comes the law.

124
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:49,291
Welcome to Refuge, strangers.

125
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:51,295
Thank you, sheriff.

126
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:54,060
You look like you've seen some trouble.

127
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:56,966
Ain't that a fact.

128
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:59,937
We're drovers. We was moving a herd
up from Chihuahua...

129
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:03,475
...when Apaches attacked us.
They stole the herd.

130
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:07,411
They killed some of us, they wounded
others, then they drove us in here.

131
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:11,518
We wasn't due to get paid
till we delivered the herd to Sweetwater.

132
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,417
So we're a little short on money too.

133
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:16,420
Well, that shouldn't be a problem.

134
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:21,358
You'll find Refuge is a charitable, friendly
little town. You can stable your horses.

135
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,593
Your men can have free drinks
in the saloon. Bed and table in the hotel.

136
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:29,737
That's mighty neighborly of you,
sheriff. Ain't it, boys?

137
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:34,467
You can stay as long as it takes to heal
your wounded and get back on your feet.

138
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:36,167
I'm much obliged.

139
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:40,907
Can you tell me where the telegraph office
is? I need to contact the owner of the herd.

140
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:46,783
We're a little off the beaten track here.
There's no telegraph office, no newspapers.

141
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:50,447
In fact, aside from the occasional strangers,
such as yourselves...

142
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,560
...we don't have much contact
with the outside world.

143
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,095
- That a fact?
- Deputy Glen...

144
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:59,392
...you show these gents where
they can put up their horses.

145
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,729
Doc Woods will treat your wounded.

146
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:06,067
Rose, would you show them
to the doc's office, please?

147
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,733
Lmagine the rest of you boys
have built up a mighty thirst.

148
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,970
Saloon's right over there.

149
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:15,913
- All right, boys, let's un-ass these saddles.
- There is just one thing.

150
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,484
- What's that?
- I would appreciate it...

151
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:22,384
...while you're in Refuge,
that you don't curse.

152
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,292
Except for the saloon, of course.

153
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:29,896
- Of course. Thank you.
- Did you hear that?

154
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,561
Right this way, gentlemen.

155
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,269
- Come on.
- Let's go get some of that water.

156
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,772
The water's over here.

157
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,509
Well, lads, what will be your pleasure?

158
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:53,279
Bottle of whiskey.

159
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,022
- This is the whole bottle.
- This one's on me.

160
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:57,783
Who are these people, anyway?

161
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,291
What are they doing in the middle
of nowhere?

162
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,793
Maybe they's Mennonites.

163
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,830
I heard they had colonies
scattered all over the place.

164
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,204
- Follow me, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

165
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,705
So it's a beautiful little town
you got here.

166
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,039
Yes, it is beautiful.

167
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:21,648
How long is it that you have lived here?

168
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,150
Five years, one week and two days.

169
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,051
That's amazing how you just know
that, like, exactly to the day.

170
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:33,058
Well, I know it's silly, but I tend
to keep track of things like that.

171
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:35,992
It appears I'm back in business.

172
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,392
Hello, Doc.

173
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,399
Step inside, gentlemen.

174
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:44,733
I recognize that sheriff from somewhere,
just can't place it.

175
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:47,170
Lucky he didn't place you.

176
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,675
- Yeah, you notice he wasn't packing.
- Neither was the deputy.

177
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,178
I didn't see a gun
in the whole damn town.

178
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:59,012
You thinking what I'm thinking?

179
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:05,419
All right, you're next, son.

180
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,528
I think it's just a flesh wound.

181
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,187
I'll tell you what it is.

182
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,602
- Well, you're lucky.
- I don't feel lucky.

183
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,863
You just lost a few inches of baby fat.

184
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:27,778
What are you looking at?

185
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:30,281
- Have you ever been in Wichita?
- Why?

186
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:33,751
- Is that where you're from?
- Yeah, from just outside of there.

187
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:36,117
My mama's got a little farm.

188
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,225
Why, you been there?

189
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,258
I was there once.

190
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:43,556
It was long before you were born.

191
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:52,530
How many men have you killed?

192
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,301
Why would you ask me
a question like that?

193
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:58,742
Your ramrod said
you were drovers, right?

194
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,142
That's right.

195
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:03,079
And that your cattle was stolen
by the Indians.

196
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,412
That's what he said.

197
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,579
Did they steal your ropes too?

198
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,986
Our ropes?

199
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,253
Yeah, I see your horses,
and I only see two or three ropes.

200
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,923
No branding irons. Aren't cowboys
supposed to have a lot of ropes?

201
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,263
You sure do ask
a lot of questions yourself.

202
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:26,136
Well, I guess you wanna be
joining your friends now.

203
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:35,407
I only killed one man.

204
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,484
He...

205
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,415
He begged me to do it.

206
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,786
Forty-five.

207
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:49,527
Forty-four-40.

208
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:53,133
Forty-five. And...

209
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,802
...45.

210
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,998
Not many Indians use a.45.

211
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:03,975
- Well, we knew they wasn't drovers.
- So, what are we gonna do about it?

212
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:08,312
We'll walk softly.
Give them plenty of room.

213
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,110
Maybe they'll leave peacefully.

214
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:13,743
And maybe they'll drop us
a thank-you note on the way out of town.

215
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:18,291
Don't work that way, sheriff.
You should've told them to keep on riding.

216
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,590
This job's yours if you want it, Glen.

217
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:28,725
I'd just as soon go off and sit under
a big tree. Believe me, I'd rather.

218
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:31,133
Forrest, nobody'd blame you for it either.

219
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:34,173
Look, the last man we want
handling this thing is Glen.

220
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,369
Why, he'd shoot the eyes out of a dove
for singing too early in the day.

221
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:43,643
Brooks is right. If we got a hope of getting
out of this jackpot, I'm pinning it on Forrest.

222
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,354
That bunch, just ride out?

223
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:52,323
We got about as much chance
of that as a one-legged man at a...

224
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:54,359
...rat stomp.

225
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,495
We got any other choice?

226
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:09,937
You had your sorry moments...

227
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:14,514
...but all in all, I'd say you did
the family real proud today.

228
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:16,275
I did?

229
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:22,390
Yeah, you acquitted yourself
real good for a green farm boy.

230
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,185
Next time I write Esther
I'm gonna tell her so.

231
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,894
Excuse me.

232
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,431
- You're the doc, right?
- And you are?

233
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,967
Smith. Jack Smith.

234
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,907
I just wanna thank you
for patching up my boys.

235
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,772
Think nothing of it.

236
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:46,072
Come on in. Let me stand you to a drink.

237
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,715
That's mighty tempting...

238
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,220
...but I don't drink anymore.

239
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:55,083
Well, that's a shame.

240
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:59,590
Nice to meet you, Mr. Smith.

241
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,599
You know, it's the damnedest thing...

242
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,001
...but I swear I seen that man
somewhere before.

243
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:14,767
He was in Wichita once.

244
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:44,228
Excuse me, Mr. Smith,
I have to go for an hour...

245
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:48,137
...so please tell your men to help
themselves to whatever they'd like.

246
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,020
Yeah, you see, I told you the whole
damn town is full of Bible-thumpers.

247
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,625
He's right, boss. Nothing but a bunch
of damn cheek-turners.

248
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,497
It's gonna be real easy.

249
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,328
What's gonna be easy?

250
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,008
It's none of your damn business.

251
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,413
How's the leg?

252
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:05,052
It hurts.

253
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,711
Bullets tend to do that.

254
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,292
Evening, miss. May I have a minute?

255
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:18,398
What do you want?

256
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:23,397
Listen, the man I shot...

257
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,972
...he was dying in the desert
and begged everyone to shoot him...

258
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:31,134
...but no one would. I mean, they
were gonna leave him to the buzzards.

259
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:35,410
Why are you telling me this?

260
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,313
Because I don't want you to misjudge me.

261
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:41,979
Why should you care what I think of you?

262
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:45,489
Because I like you.

263
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,165
What's your name?

264
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,902
Leon...

265
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:01,302
...Miller.

266
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:04,172
But most everyone just calls me Sonny.

267
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,012
What's your name?

268
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:08,580
Rose.

269
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,684
Rose, huh?

270
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,280
That's a mighty pretty name.

271
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,111
Rose what?

272
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,087
It's just Rose.

273
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,225
Well...

274
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,624
...I reckon it fits you pretty good.

275
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,658
You know, your grammar is terrible.

276
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:29,462
You know how to read?

277
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,373
Yeah, read all the time.

278
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,510
In fact, l...

279
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,047
- It's a dime novel.
- Yes, it's dime novels.

280
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:45,781
Hey, Sonny.

281
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:48,320
Why don't you bring her over
for a drink.

282
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,723
- This is the damnedest saloon I ever saw.
- Who's that?

283
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:54,157
My uncle. He gets mean
when he's drunk.

284
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,820
Where the hell are all the women?

285
00:31:57,465 --> 00:32:00,195
I'm getting real lonely.

286
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:02,396
Did you hear what I said, boy?

287
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,004
Mean when he ain't too.

288
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:08,872
Look at you, hogging all the whores.

289
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:11,238
She ain't a whore, Uncle Guthrie.

290
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:19,210
I don't care if she's a nun.
They're all whores.

291
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:27,056
You know, you shouldn't be
walking around with boys...

292
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:29,753
...when there's real men in town.

293
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:33,765
How about me and you
crack some calico?

294
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:36,236
No. Please.

295
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,433
Don't.

296
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,133
No, Forrest. You can't.

297
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,615
What's the matter, sheriff?
You know what this is, don't you?

298
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:06,132
Sorry.

299
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,393
It's not your fault.

300
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,064
I'm obliged for that, son.

301
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,568
- You gonna put him in jail?
- We don't have a jail.

302
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:21,608
What? Every town's got a jail.

303
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:23,375
Well, this one doesn't.

304
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,750
Why's everyone just standing here?

305
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:32,422
Why didn't you draw your gun?

306
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,255
You best get him to bed.

307
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,258
Good night, Sonny.

308
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,824
Y'all go to bed!

309
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:56,248
Sonny, what the hell happened here?

310
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:59,676
I didn't see. I think...

311
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:02,288
I think he fell.

312
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,120
More likely, somebody felled him.

313
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,594
Get him off the street.

314
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,297
Glorious day, Glen.

315
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,136
Yep.

316
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,372
Beautiful morning, Brooks.

317
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:26,877
Indeed, Brother Lamb.

318
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,480
Morning.

319
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:43,163
Morning, Sonny.

320
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,822
Hi. Morning, sheriff.

321
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,400
Mr. Smith up and about?

322
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:50,560
I ain't seen him yet.

323
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:53,938
I'd like to speak to him
when you see him.

324
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:55,575
I'll make sure to tell him.

325
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,143
Hey, sir?

326
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:04,816
How long have you been
sheriff of this town?

327
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:07,853
Oh, better part of 10 years, why?

328
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,922
- Nothing.
- You know...

329
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:12,252
...you don't seem as seasoned
as the rest.

330
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,596
How'd you fall in
with this bunch, anyhow?

331
00:35:17,765 --> 00:35:20,131
I begged my uncle to come along
with him.

332
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:22,531
On the cattle drive?

333
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,606
Bet by now you wish you hadn't, huh?

334
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:30,274
Yes, sir.

335
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,143
I feel like I was ate by a coyote
and crapped off a cliff.

336
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,320
Hey, Sonny!

337
00:36:14,488 --> 00:36:17,889
Did you see which one of them
Bible-thumpers bushwhacked me?

338
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,951
No, sir.

339
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:24,928
Cavin, I want you to take your nephew
and check the general store.

340
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,090
We're gonna need ammo.

341
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:30,159
- Probably don't have any.
- Check anyway.

342
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:32,101
What will I use for money?

343
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,138
Your imagination.

344
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:38,144
- Sir?
- What?

345
00:36:38,312 --> 00:36:41,110
The sheriff said he wanted to see you.

346
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,681
- He say what about?
- No, sir.

347
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:48,655
All right.

348
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,187
We got company.

349
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:00,530
Morning.

350
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,362
The boy said you wanted to see me.

351
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,039
Care for a cup of java?

352
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,199
Be obliged.

353
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:11,538
So how do you like our little town?

354
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:13,703
Lt'll do.

355
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,143
So, what's this all about?

356
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,889
One of your men got out of line
last night.

357
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,221
Used foul language
toward one of our women.

358
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:32,730
- That'd be Cavin.
- Yes, I believe it was.

359
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,562
I wish you'd speak to him.

360
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:41,564
I'll do that sheriff, but Cavin seemed
to have a grievance of his own.

361
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:44,734
Seems that one of your citizens
hit him over the head.

362
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:47,073
Well, I doubt if it was
one of my people.

363
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,847
You calling him a liar?

364
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:54,684
No, I only said I didn't see
one of my people do it.

365
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,255
Now, he was blind drunk.

366
00:37:57,425 --> 00:38:01,054
Maybe he passed out
and just didn't wanna own up to it.

367
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:05,592
Yeah, maybe so.

368
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,363
So you will talk to him?

369
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:13,105
Look, he gives you any more trouble,
why don't you just throw him in jail?

370
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,171
That is, if you got the sand.

371
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:25,381
I had hoped it wouldn't come
to that, Mr. Smith.

372
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:28,718
We have extended our hospitality.

373
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,551
You're damn right we have.

374
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,220
That's enough, Glen.

375
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,559
The least we can expect in return
is for you to control your men.

376
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,725
I can promise you one thing, sheriff.

377
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,893
My men do exactly what I tell them to.

378
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,529
That's all I'm asking.
Everything else all right at the hotel?

379
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,969
- Your wounded being tended to?
- Everything's fine.

380
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:55,475
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Not at all.

381
00:38:55,649 --> 00:39:00,552
In all my years on the frontier, I never run
across a sheriff that wasn't armed.

382
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:02,814
How come you ain't packing?

383
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,550
Well, we never found the need in Refuge.

384
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:09,162
What? There are no guns
in this whole town?

385
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,822
- We have our own ways here, Mr. Smith.
- Damn right.

386
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,601
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Pleasure.

387
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,948
You are walking a thin line.

388
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,852
That man all but slapped you
in the face with a glove, sheriff.

389
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:37,183
That's not what I'm talking about.

390
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:42,292
You said "damn" twice.

391
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,428
Just keep him busy for a while.

392
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:04,374
Morning, gents.
What can I do for you?

393
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:08,181
We's just looking.

394
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:10,820
Please, look.

395
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,982
Right.

396
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,785
Sure got a lot of stuff here
for being so far from anywhere.

397
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:19,398
Yes, we have the latest of everything.

398
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:22,730
- Hey, you got any dime novels?
- No, I'm sorry...

399
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:25,064
...but we do carry all the classics.

400
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,639
You might want to check out
the classics, son.

401
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:31,505
Get a whole lot more out of them
than you would those dime novels.

402
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,910
I never had much use for reading
myself before I came here.

403
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:37,516
Now I find that l...

404
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,280
What's the matter, son?
Do I have a smudge of flour on my face?

405
00:40:41,455 --> 00:40:43,685
No, I'm sorry.

406
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:48,194
Did anyone ever say that you
kind of look like Jesse James?

407
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:55,092
Well, now that you mention it,
a man in Tulsa once said that to me.

408
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:58,766
Why, did you...? Did you know Jesse?

409
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:03,941
Well, no, but I read quite a bit about him,
and I saw some likenesses.

410
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:09,780
Although, I think he was
a little bit taller than you are.

411
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:14,218
Yeah, that's what the man
in Tulsa said too.

412
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:25,723
Nice shop you got here.

413
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,563
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm rather proud of it.

414
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,205
Like I said, we just looking.

415
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,731
Of course.

416
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:41,705
Thank you, sir.

417
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,151
Help yourself, boys.

418
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:53,824
This town's easy picking.

419
00:41:53,994 --> 00:41:56,258
You didn't get away
as clean as you thought.

420
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,421
So what?

421
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:08,669
I don't see no bold moves
being made our way.

422
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:12,676
I don't think they got an ounce
of bold between the bunch of them.

423
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,919
I'm sick and tired of acting polite.

424
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,025
Tell the boys they can have
their way with this town.

425
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,635
I like to watch that Danny ride,
I'll tell you what.

426
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,681
Get our people off the street.

427
00:42:57,558 --> 00:43:00,220
Your men seem to have
a lot of time on their hands.

428
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:01,884
Yeah, what of it?

429
00:43:02,062 --> 00:43:05,327
Maybe they'd like to split some wood.
Sort of earn their keep.

430
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,660
Earn their keep?

431
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,133
Yeah, it seems
like a reasonable suggestion.

432
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:14,536
- I'll split some wood. Heck, it's the least...
- You ain't chopping nothing, boy.

433
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:19,303
Anything else, sheriff?

434
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,472
Yes, please ask your men
to slow down these horses...

435
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,811
...and stop throwing knives
at our church.

436
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:26,680
Why don't you tell them?

437
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,515
I doubt they'd listen to me.

438
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,681
Then you got yourself a problem, sheriff.

439
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,592
Yes, it appears I do.

440
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:41,691
You miserable little bastard, I ought
to pistol-whip you. You listening?

441
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,270
Get us some whiskey. Go on.

442
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:54,544
- You owe me another 5.
- There's a barn out at the edge of town.

443
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,774
You can take your knife-throwing there.

444
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,510
No, that's too far to walk.

445
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:02,451
What if I set a plank up
in the middle of the street?

446
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,725
We're doing just fine right here.

447
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:11,923
I am asking you nicely to stop
throwing knives at our church.

448
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,578
Now, I'm asking you to stop.

449
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:36,285
This ought to be interesting.

450
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,411
Five bucks says you can't put
it right in the windpipe.

451
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:09,573
That sheriff is either lucky or...

452
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,047
or what?

453
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,426
Let's go inside and drink.

454
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,132
Go on! Go on!

455
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:13,301
Go on!

456
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,113
Come on! Come on!

457
00:48:24,284 --> 00:48:26,218
Come on!

458
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,899
Whoa! Whoa!

459
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:14,859
Where are we?

460
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:19,529
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Come inside.

461
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,934
- All right, folks.
- Forrest?

462
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:26,079
I got a message for you.

463
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:34,577
It's time you packed your grip, son.
Come noon Sunday, you're going home.

464
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:14,087
Go on!

465
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,658
Come on!

466
00:50:34,648 --> 00:50:36,946
Don't you just feel joyful?

467
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,108
Why, I see you got a saloon.

468
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,618
Yep, but you can't go in there.

469
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,313
One step through those doors,
and it's all over.

470
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:48,222
- Seems like a lot of damn rules.
- No cursing either.

471
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:50,886
You came in last night
on a stagecoach, right?

472
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:52,531
This is no concern of yours.

473
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:55,293
I wanna know how she
can be alive and breathing...

474
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,494
...when I saw her dead in Sweetwater.

475
00:50:57,671 --> 00:51:01,607
- Maybe you were thinking of someone else.
- No. She died in my arms.

476
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:07,540
The first person I ever saw got killed.
I ain't likely to be mistaken about that.

477
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:11,650
Do you deny it? You're Dolly Sloan,
harlot with a heart.

478
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,809
Dolly Sloan?

479
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,384
Oh, you mean the lady gambler? Yeah.

480
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:20,549
I've been told I look a lot like her.

481
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:23,025
Sorry, young man, but my name is...

482
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,992
- Ivy.
- I know what I saw.

483
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,500
What about that stage that disappeared
into thin air last night?

484
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,798
- Please, just let it be.
- I can't.

485
00:51:33,974 --> 00:51:35,498
You have to, Sonny.

486
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:41,174
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we're showing lvy the town.

487
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:51,686
Good day.

488
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,162
Holliday, draw!

489
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,238
That's a pretty dangerous game
you're playing there.

490
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:13,208
You gonna deny you're Doc Holliday?

491
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,078
A man sneaks up on you
and calls you out, you're gonna react.

492
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:20,947
I don't care if they call you
Mary, Queen of Scots.

493
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:23,954
Don't think I don't know
what's going on here.

494
00:52:24,457 --> 00:52:26,789
Suppose you tell me.

495
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,054
Well, somehow, I don't have
that whole thing figured out...

496
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,721
...but y'all ain't dead the way
people think.

497
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:37,461
This town some sort of hole-in-the-wall
for famous outlaws looking to retire.

498
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,971
You don't say.

499
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,233
You're damn right, I do.

500
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:48,143
See, Forrest, he's Wild Bill Hickok, and that
deputy of his looks just like Billy the Kid.

501
00:52:48,315 --> 00:52:51,148
How about the guy who owns
the general store there?

502
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:52,808
- Brooks?
- Yeah, Brooks.

503
00:52:52,986 --> 00:52:55,454
If he ain't Jesse James,
I'll eat my hat.

504
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:57,783
Except I always thought Jesse was taller.

505
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:01,325
And then there's that farmer.
He looks just like Lefty Slade.

506
00:53:01,494 --> 00:53:04,429
And what famous outlaw is Rose?

507
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:08,398
I don't know.
She ain't in any of my books, but...

508
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:11,103
What don't make sense to me is...

509
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,934
...if you are all those people,
why y'all eating Blackjack's crow?

510
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,905
You could handle him easy.

511
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:20,444
Blackjack? You mean Mr. Smith?

512
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,782
So that's Blackjack Britton?

513
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:31,618
I've heard of him. He cut
a real wide swath through Missouri.

514
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:35,493
What's a farm kid like you
doing riding with the likes of him?

515
00:53:35,662 --> 00:53:38,358
I wasn't supposed to let on.
You're not gonna tell...?

516
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:42,865
- You're not gonna tell Forrest, are you?
- Forrest isn't as dumb as you think.

517
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:47,097
I suggest that you reflect real hard
on your situation, Sonny.

518
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:51,967
A few bad choices
and a man can lose his soul.

519
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,722
Morning.

520
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:11,390
Morning there, young fella.

521
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:13,657
You seen Rose?

522
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:16,126
No. Haven't seen her.

523
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:21,738
You're Lefty, aren't you?

524
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,337
- Lefty?
- Lefty Slade.

525
00:54:27,747 --> 00:54:29,305
Excuse me?

526
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:34,010
You were killed in Tombstone. Three shots
to the chest and one to the left wrist.

527
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,682
My name's Lamb.

528
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:40,350
Yeah, then what's that?

529
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,360
- I killed men for less than that.
- I know.

530
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,794
Cyrus Beaudry in Dodge
and Peewee Winters...

531
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:49,697
...when he laughed at your shoeshine.
- It wasn't over any shoeshine.

532
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,928
<i>It's in The Blazing Gun of Lefty Slade.</i>

533
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:57,065
That fool writer never even talked to me.
Besides, I got nothing to say to you.

534
00:54:59,612 --> 00:55:01,204
Hey!

535
00:55:03,783 --> 00:55:06,775
Hey! Get out of there!
That's my garden!

536
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,451
Get out of my garden!

537
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:21,462
Get out of there!

538
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,909
You son of a...

539
00:55:56,269 --> 00:56:00,501
Lamb? Lamb, what have you done?

540
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,608
Eight years.

541
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:12,009
I thought I was beyond it, but...

542
00:56:12,185 --> 00:56:15,120
- I'm so sorry, Lamb.
- Me too.

543
00:58:55,682 --> 00:58:57,309
Blackjack Britton!

544
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,425
- How'd you know?
- That's not important.

545
00:59:11,197 --> 00:59:15,031
You're no longer welcome in Refuge.
Collect your men and ride out.

546
00:59:16,936 --> 00:59:18,870
Sheriff?

547
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,606
You know what you need?

548
00:59:25,211 --> 00:59:28,806
You need yourself a good
old-fashioned pistol-whipping.

549
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,810
Come on, boss, bring him down.

550
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,953
- Come on, Blackjack.
- Glen, no! No. No.

551
00:59:50,303 --> 00:59:51,895
To hell with this.

552
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:55,199
Blow him away, Blackjack.
Nobody will do nothing.

553
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:58,071
The whole town is full of cowards.

554
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,758
What the hell is that?

555
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:30,072
I want every man jack
in the saloon, right now.

556
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:49,455
Hey, not you.

557
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:15,587
Drink up, boys. Come sunup,
we're gonna ride back into that desert...

558
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,486
...and head south for Chihuahua.
- What about supplies?

559
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:22,127
Take whatever the hell you can carry.

560
01:01:22,295 --> 01:01:24,661
Anybody makes a fuss, kill them.

561
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:29,928
Except for that little girlfriend of my
nephew's. Y'all just leave her to me.

562
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:39,277
Y'all know where Rose is?

563
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:08,071
Rose.

564
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:10,709
- Sonny.
- I gotta talk to you.

565
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:13,846
You can come on out.
I promise I won't look.

566
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,060
You can turn around.

567
01:02:41,307 --> 01:02:43,207
Listen, there's...

568
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:47,409
What is that around your neck?

569
01:02:49,749 --> 01:02:52,274
Lefty Slade had something
like that on his wrist.

570
01:02:52,452 --> 01:02:56,013
I suppose Forrest would have one
of those on the back of his head...

571
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,317
...where Broken Nose Jack McCall
shot Wild Bill Hickok.

572
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,688
Rose?

573
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:07,198
Is that how you died?

574
01:03:09,268 --> 01:03:11,202
Yes.

575
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:19,042
I was the first woman ever
to be hanged in the Arizona Territory.

576
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:24,943
I was 19 at the time.

577
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,120
You're Betty McCullough.

578
01:03:32,124 --> 01:03:35,616
The one who hacked her father
to death with a meat cleaver?

579
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:42,634
Everyone forgot to mention how he had
his dirty hands all over me since I was 12.

580
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,804
Is Refuge like a place where
you get a second chance?

581
01:03:53,312 --> 01:03:56,577
Last chance is more like it.

582
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:03,087
Listen, I was thinking that I might
stay behind when the rest leave.

583
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:08,159
- But...
- I like you, Sonny. A lot.

584
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:13,057
But you're gonna have to ride out
with them when they leave tomorrow.

585
01:04:13,232 --> 01:04:16,099
That's why I came here.
They're gonna tear up the town.

586
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:19,397
I heard them say it. If y'all
don't do something about it...

587
01:04:19,572 --> 01:04:23,167
...y'all might end up dead
by the time they leave.

588
01:04:23,342 --> 01:04:26,004
Dying's not what bothers us.

589
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,612
That was the easy part.

590
01:04:30,182 --> 01:04:32,707
If you've figured it out
like you say you have...

591
01:04:32,885 --> 01:04:34,876
...you know it goes way beyond that.

592
01:04:35,054 --> 01:04:37,522
Okay, maybe I can help.
I'll talk to Forrest.

593
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,851
Maybe I can convince them
to do something.

594
01:04:40,026 --> 01:04:41,789
No. It wouldn't do any good.

595
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,458
Okay.

596
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:54,967
All right. I'll ask them.

597
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,944
I'm not promising anything.

598
01:04:59,111 --> 01:05:02,205
- When?
- Tonight at church.

599
01:05:02,548 --> 01:05:04,982
I'll be waiting outside.

600
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,982
You're a nice young man, Sonny.

601
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,322
I wish I had met you
at a different time.

602
01:05:53,265 --> 01:05:57,099
Well, I'll be waiting outside the church.

603
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,459
I bet it was him who let my name slip.

604
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,222
That little bastard.

605
01:06:30,636 --> 01:06:33,696
Ask lvy. She was in Sweetwater.
She knows what they'll do.

606
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:39,101
I can't believe you're all just gonna stand
around and let yourselves get slaughtered.

607
01:06:40,146 --> 01:06:44,082
You come from a world of options,
and we have none.

608
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,311
- There's only two ways out for us, Sonny.
- Amen.

609
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:53,424
Refuge is where the marginally good
are gleaned from the hopelessly wicked.

610
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:57,961
All the temptations that we faced
in our previous lives are here.

611
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:02,157
The saloon, the guns, the rotten people.

612
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:07,495
You lift a gun one time, it's over.
For all of us.

613
01:07:07,673 --> 01:07:10,767
If each of us holds out for 10 years,
neither inflicting...

614
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:15,312
...nor attracting harm,
we're spared the fate of Brother Lamb.

615
01:07:15,514 --> 01:07:18,813
Forrest has been here the longest
and has less than 24 hours...

616
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:21,452
...before he enters this house justified.

617
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,248
If we go up against them armed,
we're doomed.

618
01:07:24,423 --> 01:07:27,881
If we just stand and let them
shoot us down, we're doomed.

619
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,528
Either way we're going to hell.

620
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:33,756
Then stand up to them and take
a few of them down with you.

621
01:07:33,933 --> 01:07:37,835
- We can't, Sonny.
- The longer we're here, the meeker we get.

622
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,800
Even if I was willing,
I don't reckon I have it in me anymore.

623
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:44,807
Except for Glen, none of us do.

624
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:48,538
After what happened
to Brother Lamb, I ain't about to.

625
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:54,980
And to think some of you
used to be my heroes.

626
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,341
Where you going, boy?

627
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:27,552
- You bastard!
- Hit him again.

628
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,358
I'm gonna crush you!

629
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,261
Sonny!

630
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:19,404
You want him, you got him.

631
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,301
Sonny.

632
01:09:23,475 --> 01:09:26,638
Sonny? Oh, Sonny.

633
01:09:26,812 --> 01:09:29,747
Doc, is he okay?

634
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,643
- Sonny.
- Doesn't look good.

635
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,555
Let's get him over to my office.

636
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,734
He's coming around.

637
01:09:50,836 --> 01:09:54,738
Sonny? Can you hear me?

638
01:09:58,177 --> 01:10:01,078
- Rose?
- Yes, Sonny.

639
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:05,781
- Am I dead?
- No.

640
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:09,182
That's too bad.

641
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:12,515
Maybe you and I could've...

642
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,524
Welcome back, kid.

643
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:30,437
I can't tell you how much it pains me
that we weren't able to help you.

644
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:37,645
It's okay. I understand.

645
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,387
I'm not gonna let them do it to you.

646
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:51,057
I'll take them all on myself.

647
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:54,666
Not now, Sonny. You have to rest now.

648
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:03,733
Not much else we can do, Doc.

649
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:09,240
Don't you worry.

650
01:11:42,281 --> 01:11:46,445
All right, let's get a move on,
you bunch of desert rats.

651
01:11:46,618 --> 01:11:51,112
In 15 minutes, we start knocking
this town over one door at a time.

652
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:03,265
Fifteen minutes is all I need.

653
01:12:06,038 --> 01:12:08,802
You'll have your fun later, Cavin.

654
01:12:09,641 --> 01:12:12,405
Sheriff! He's gone.

655
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,308
- Sonny?
- Yeah, he's gone.

656
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:17,745
Shape he was in
he couldn't have gone far.

657
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:20,976
- He was there an hour ago when I looked in.
- He's gone.

658
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:30,318
Sonny.

659
01:12:32,164 --> 01:12:34,655
You should be in bed, son.

660
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:39,793
- What are you doing?
- I can't let them do it, Rose. I promised you.

661
01:12:42,508 --> 01:12:45,341
I'll be damned, the kid's on his feet.

662
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:48,309
And don't he look like he wants
some action, though.

663
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,439
Sonny, don't be stupid.
Get out while you still got time.

664
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:57,146
I ain't going nowhere. And I don't think
you're gonna try and make me.

665
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,457
Do you even know how
to shoot that thing?

666
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,687
Of course I do.

667
01:13:05,597 --> 01:13:08,361
Oh, yeah, they'll be quaking
in their boots.

668
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:15,869
I'm gonna chop off his ears,
hang them on my saddle horn.

669
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,277
Whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa!

670
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:29,283
This is the last chance you got,
son, to change your mind.

671
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:38,125
Come on, honey.

672
01:13:38,297 --> 01:13:40,697
Sonny, you don't have to do this.

673
01:13:41,066 --> 01:13:44,035
That's not true.
I don't have any choice.

674
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,229
We've gotta go.

675
01:13:48,273 --> 01:13:49,501
I love you.

676
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,743
We gotta go.

677
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:06,849
We best be going in.

678
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:08,686
Yeah.

679
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,026
Forrest, you're coming?

680
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,532
No, you go on.

681
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,364
What?

682
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:31,939
The only thing I've been thinking about
the last 10 years is myself.

683
01:14:32,951 --> 01:14:35,215
"I'm gonna get through this.

684
01:14:37,156 --> 01:14:39,624
Just like I did my whole life."

685
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:44,221
And this green kid comes along...

686
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:48,059
...stands here, ready to die
for the woman he loves.

687
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:51,134
No thought to himself.

688
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,271
Kind of makes a man think.

689
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,467
Makes me think you're loco.
You've only got five hours left.

690
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,638
Yep.

691
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,650
You go on, Doc.

692
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,619
You got three bells to get inside.

693
01:15:55,534 --> 01:15:57,525
What do you think you're doing?

694
01:15:58,203 --> 01:16:00,865
Down the hole's down the hole.

695
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:04,203
I might as well have a little fun
on the way.

696
01:16:17,222 --> 01:16:18,883
What the hell?

697
01:16:20,892 --> 01:16:23,554
That's exactly what it is.

698
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,653
Hope you're ready to meet it.

699
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:04,868
Well, welcome aboard, Jesse.

700
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:08,370
I was planning on holding out
till my brother got here...

701
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:11,600
...but the old buzzard just refuses to die.

702
01:17:13,278 --> 01:17:18,113
Yep, no matter what else they said about
you, Billy, I always knew you had sand.

703
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,286
Sorry for what I said.

704
01:17:23,455 --> 01:17:27,721
It's okay, son.
You were right all along.

705
01:17:31,596 --> 01:17:35,191
- Who are they?
- I guess they ain't Mennonites.

706
01:17:35,967 --> 01:17:41,633
The way the man wears those guns
puts your mind to Wild Bill Hickok.

707
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,976
He's been dead 10 years.
Everybody knows it.

708
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,749
Let's get it done, boys.

709
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,161
They ain't budging, boss.

710
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,262
Let's give them a little prodding.

711
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:13,666
Hank, do it.

712
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:17,106
Come on.

713
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:19,004
Get ready.

714
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:35,418
Well, let's get to it.

715
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,925
- Yeah!
- Here.

716
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:47,156
This is your last invitation
to turn around and ride out.

717
01:19:50,402 --> 01:19:53,894
Sheriff, your mother's a whore.

718
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,777
I have no mother.

719
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:19,788
It's still our 16 to your four, sheriff.
The odds are against you.

720
01:20:34,946 --> 01:20:37,141
The odds are getting better.

721
01:20:51,663 --> 01:20:54,257
Draw your gun! Come on!

722
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:02,501
Draw your gun!
Shoot the damn thing!

723
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,609
Shoot him!

724
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,320
He shot me.

725
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:11,402
Yeah, it's a long way from your heart.

726
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:35,484
Go! Now!

727
01:23:43,168 --> 01:23:45,102
Go! Go! Go!

728
01:24:11,996 --> 01:24:13,657
Get back!

729
01:25:00,712 --> 01:25:03,579
- Sonny!
- Rose!

730
01:25:43,955 --> 01:25:47,049
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

731
01:25:58,469 --> 01:26:00,460
It's funny.

732
01:26:02,307 --> 01:26:04,468
It don't hurt none.

733
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:19,151
How come I'm not dead?

734
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:29,324
Welcome to Refuge, son.

735
01:26:51,689 --> 01:26:53,520
Wild Bill Hickok.

736
01:26:55,193 --> 01:26:58,526
I reckon the odds are against me now.

737
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:01,531
Put that gun belt back on.

738
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:07,296
We got one thing left to settle.
That's you and me.

739
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:11,499
Look at me, you son of a bitch.

740
01:27:11,676 --> 01:27:13,610
Look at Blackjack Britton.

741
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:32,955
I guess I'm one of you now.

742
01:27:33,131 --> 01:27:34,962
I wouldn't count on it.

743
01:29:12,797 --> 01:29:14,560
Come on!

744
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,544
Come on!

745
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,604
Come on!

746
01:29:35,853 --> 01:29:37,081
Come on!

747
01:29:38,289 --> 01:29:40,052
Whoa!

748
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,996
Time to go home, folks.

749
01:29:55,006 --> 01:29:59,102
The Creator may be tough,
but he ain't blind.

750
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:31,668
Climb aboard, Sonny.

751
01:30:36,914 --> 01:30:39,906
- Do I have to?
- Well, you got nothing left to prove.

752
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:47,415
I'm gonna stay.

753
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,686
Refuge is a place of hard rules, Sonny.

754
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,923
I know what it is.

755
01:30:57,435 --> 01:30:59,562
And I think I'm gonna make it.

756
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:11,712
Well, good luck to you, son.

757
01:31:18,956 --> 01:31:21,789
Your seat will be here when you want it.

758
01:31:26,097 --> 01:31:27,962
Come on!

759
01:31:28,305 --> 01:32:28,436
