2
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,526
Coming in!

3
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,943
- Come on. Double time!
- Let's go! Come on!

4
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:08,480
- Don't blow it.
- Steady!

5
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:11,677
All right, guys.
Move out! Let's go!

6
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:14,721
- Where's Stark and Westlake?
- Didn't make it.

7
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:16,654
- Rudy too?
- All three.

8
00:03:16,724 --> 00:03:18,749
Oh, man! What happened?

9
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:21,260
Cuban soldiers caught us
in a cross fire on the beach...

10
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,627
an hour after you guys took off.

11
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:27,156
Shit, man, that's bad.
We're fucked now.

12
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:29,533
Fidel Castro today accused
the United States...

13
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:32,038
of being behind yesterday's
predawn raid...

14
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:34,939
on what appears to have been
a drug processing plant...

15
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:37,204
some 30 miles south of Havana.

16
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:39,508
- A force of 20 men landed...
- Twenty?

17
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,105
What an insult.
It should have felt like 50.

18
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:44,879
Three of the men were killed
by Cuban military forces.

19
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:48,513
They've been tentatively identified
as James Stark, Kevin Westlake...

20
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:51,183
and Rudy Garcia, all from the U.S.

21
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,284
Talk about how many we killed.

22
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,295
Goddamned bureaucratic bitch.

23
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:58,560
U.S. Officials deny involvement...

24
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:01,966
in this independent venture...

25
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:06,973
utilizing mercenaries and financed
by anti-Castro forces.

26
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,738
Officials went on to say
there was no way such a raid...

27
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:12,711
- could have been launched...
- In other words...

28
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,975
we no longer officially exist.

29
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:17,244
In other words,
we're out of a fucking job.

30
00:04:17,318 --> 00:04:20,116
Shit, man. I've got
a mortgage to pay.

31
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:23,247
Congress will launch a full
investigation into the raid.

32
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:25,417
Deny American involvement?

33
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:27,290
Deny that, motherfucker.

34
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:28,988
You couldn't just
change the channel?

35
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:31,531
- Kick his ass!
- I fucking changed the channel.

36
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:34,227
Me and fucking Elvis.

37
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,404
So what do we do now?

38
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:39,598
Nothing.

39
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:43,410
We just wait.

40
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:46,446
Something will come along.

41
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:08,568
Who is that?

42
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:11,867
Get that fool!
Get him, boy!

43
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:14,800
I'll teach you!

44
00:05:16,243 --> 00:05:17,710
Now I'll show you.

45
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:24,149
You ain't done yet.

46
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:37,029
- Jerome, are you okay?
- Get off of me.

47
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:39,464
I don't need your help, dude.

48
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,331
Why don't you try me?

49
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:45,338
Mr. Tay, I want you out of here.
Both of you, out!

50
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:47,806
- Fuck you!
- Get out!

51
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,672
Go to class!

52
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,643
- Go to class.
- Please go to class.

53
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:56,444
Go on. Get out of here.

54
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:01,182
What is it with you?
You're determined to be O.T.'d?

55
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:03,985
I'm standing here.
You're always hassling me.

56
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:05,753
I'm not hassling you, Mr. Lacas.

57
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:09,057
I'm speaking to you because you're
intelligent, you're a leader.

58
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,725
I need you to look at me
for two minutes, Juan.

59
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,233
I've heard the speeches, Jane.

60
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:17,566
I don't make speeches. I'm speaking
to you with respect as a person.

61
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:20,436
You're no person to me, bitch,
so back the fuck off.

62
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:24,740
- 'Cause if you don't...
- If I don't, what?

63
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,370
You'll fucking wish you did.

64
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:31,816
What were his exact words?

65
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,215
What were his exact words?

66
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:37,113
That if I didn't back off,
I'd wish I did.

67
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:39,250
- No, "fucking" wish you did.
- Yes.

68
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:40,418
That's terrible.

69
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:44,726
But technically speaking,
it wasn't a direct threat.

70
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,960
You mean he didn't say he was going to
stab me with a knife at 4:15 p. m.

71
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:52,369
- No, he didn't say that.
- But his attitude was threatening.

72
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,034
- I can't O.T. Him for attitude.
- Look, Claude.

73
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:58,567
You know me.
I don't quit on my kids.

74
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:01,114
But this guy is dangerous.
The kids are scared of him.

75
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:03,275
Believe it or not,
some are here to learn.

76
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,682
I agree,
but I can't boot him out...

77
00:07:05,753 --> 00:07:08,813
without definite proof
of wrongdoing.

78
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,823
I don't want a lawsuit.

79
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,952
Fine. You want proof?
I'll get you proof.

80
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:24,337
Here she comes.

81
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:36,783
Cute, sweetheart.
All for nothing, mama.

82
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,817
Have a beer with us.

83
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:43,516
I want to see that beautiful ass.

84
00:07:57,638 --> 00:07:59,196
Fucking bitch.

85
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:03,334
Fuck you up, bitch!

86
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,674
I'm gonna lick your pussy like this.

87
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,612
Get the fuck out of the car!

88
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:17,789
See you later!

89
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:20,156
I'll drop by the house.

90
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:29,691
You bastard.

91
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:32,933
I've never been so happy
to see anybody in my life.

92
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,560
I missed you too.
What's going on?

93
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:39,470
My students are trying
to kill me. How are you?

94
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:47,908
Hey, come here.
Let me take care of it.

95
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,719
Shale.

96
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:04,593
Shale, you always had
the greatest hands.

97
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,098
I missed you, cari×¡a.

98
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,501
What are you doing here anyway?

99
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,976
Arert you supposed to be
off on some secret mission?

100
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:21,408
No, they retired us.

101
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:22,915
Really?

102
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:26,447
You okay with that?

103
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,687
No.

104
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,454
What are you going to do?

105
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:39,264
I guess I'll be a stockbroker.

106
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:45,628
- Yeah, right.
- I could be a stockbroker.

107
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:20,633
Shale? Joey. Got a gig.
Meet me at 10:00 at the strip joint.

108
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,642
Hey, it's Uzi night.

109
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,644
- Try your luck.
- Joey.

110
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:04,578
Tell me about the gig.

111
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:07,484
This guy's name is Wolfson.
He's a lawyer.

112
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:09,647
I hate lawyers.

113
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:11,520
He's money.

114
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:14,356
This guy's got a client
who's looking for a trained crew.

115
00:12:14,428 --> 00:12:16,453
He wants to meet you tomorrow,
10:00.

116
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,758
Trained crew for what?

117
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,227
That's what the meeting's for.

118
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:27,299
I don't know.
I don't like it.

119
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:30,207
You don't even know
what it is yet.

120
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:32,802
- Drugs?
- It's not drugs.

121
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:36,774
Come on, I busted my ass
to set this up.

122
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,648
Don't go in there
and fuck it up.

123
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:43,570
When the world is giving
you trouble, think John Janus.

124
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:45,418
When the world is giving
you trouble, think John Janus.

125
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:49,258
"Soldier of Fortune" magazine
calls him the ultimate mercenary.

126
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:52,059
- That's nice.
- From Tripoli to Panama he's proven it.

127
00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:55,465
Piano wire, knives,
artillery, land mines...

128
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:57,766
- bayonets, helicopter repelling...
- Isn't that funny?

129
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:59,829
Smoke jumping, parachuting,
karate...

130
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:03,070
missiles, guns and his bare hands.

131
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:05,805
They don't call him
a one-man army for nothing.

132
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,474
So when you want clean, private
mercenary work at reasonable rates...

133
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,178
think John Janus.

134
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:15,517
- That was so hot.
- It really was.

135
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:17,284
Great editing too.
Who was the editor?

136
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:19,587
The guy that does rock videos.

137
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:23,852
Thanks, John.
Stay and watch Mr. Shale's reel.

138
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:25,091
I don't have a reel.

139
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,627
I see.

140
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:30,897
Why don't I show John out?

141
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:33,701
- John.
- Thank you, Matt.

142
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:36,470
Get yourself a video, old-timer.

143
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:41,313
Thanks for coming.
Really very impressive.

144
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:44,350
- We'll be in touch soon.
- Thank you very much.

145
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,545
- See you, sweet thing.
- Talk to you soon.

146
00:13:53,627 --> 00:13:55,891
God, that's better.

147
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:58,158
I've been holding that for 20 minutes
waiting for her to leave.

148
00:13:58,232 --> 00:14:02,464
- Thank you for sharing.
- Ten grams of fiber every morning.

149
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:04,504
Flushes all the toxins
right out of your system.

150
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:07,404
It's great.
Regularity is the key.

151
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:13,110
- You want some?
- No, I flushed this morning.

152
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,307
Orange juice, decaf, tea?

153
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:17,407
No, thank you.
Can we talk about the job?

154
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:22,116
You're a real cut-to-the-chase
kind of guy.

155
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:24,316
- That's me.
- Thank you, Dierdre.

156
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:26,951
- Sure, Matt.
- Good. I like that.

157
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:29,188
Uh, all right.

158
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:33,529
My client runs an import business
dealing in South American goods.

159
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,728
Obviously, his business depends on
a steady flow of products.

160
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:37,895
Regularity is the key?

161
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:41,607
Very good. Exactly.

162
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:44,667
Delays can cost you
a large chunk of the market.

163
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:46,906
We're looking
for trained soldiers...

164
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,971
who can guarantee the shipments...

165
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:52,610
and have the ability to deal decisively
with anyone who tries to interfere.

166
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:55,412
Like who?

167
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:59,152
Well, our competitors...

168
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:04,095
certain government agencies,
which sometimes is the same thing.

169
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,325
Uh-huh.

170
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,564
So what you're looking for is a crew
to protect your drug shipments...

171
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,605
possibly kill any rival dealers...

172
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:17,038
and maybe even government agents
if they happen to get in the way?

173
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,170
Didn't I say you were
a cut-to-the-chase kind of guy?

174
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:24,043
You don't want soldiers.
You want killers.

175
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:26,677
You'll have to
excuse me here, Shale...

176
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,687
because I wasn't aware
there was a difference.

177
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:32,521
There's a difference.
You want to know what it is?

178
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:35,653
Yeah, I'll play.
Tell me what the difference is.

179
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,492
But I don't want any...

180
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,758
The difference is...

181
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:45,566
you're still breathing.

182
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:54,340
That cereal does work.

183
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:02,453
- What's with you?
- I told you no drugs.

184
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:05,423
Did the plate in your head
shift or something?

185
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:07,517
That's all that's out there.

186
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:10,620
- At least it's a job.
- A job, Joey?

187
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:17,295
You ever look up
the word "mercenary"?

188
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:19,305
It's someone who works
merely for money.

189
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,209
Everybody works for money.

190
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:26,177
It's not the money that bothers me.
It's the "merely. "

191
00:16:57,978 --> 00:17:00,742
- Hi, Miss Andrewson.
- Hi. Um, Janie?

192
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:03,578
- She went jogging at the beach.
- Thanks.

193
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:35,106
Watch out!

194
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:19,158
I know it hurts, baby.
Try not to move. Don't move.

195
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:33,231
How are you feeling?

196
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:36,607
I feel good.

197
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:38,644
That's the painkillers.

198
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:41,078
I talked to the cops.

199
00:18:41,148 --> 00:18:44,413
They got an "all-points" out
on a six-foot-six Seminole.

200
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:48,944
Yeah? You'll find a zillion
of them in the Everglades.

201
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,088
- Where are my clothes?
- They hid them so you can't find them.

202
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,957
- Yeah, right.
- Lie down.

203
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:57,519
- I hate hospitals.
- It's just for a couple of days.

204
00:18:57,597 --> 00:19:00,088
Come on. Your leg's busted.
You can't walk.

205
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,828
It is busted.

206
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:04,666
Lacas set me up.

207
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:07,298
- Is he the one who hassled you?
- It had to be him.

208
00:19:07,374 --> 00:19:11,105
- I'll take care of him.
- You'll drop a grenade on him.

209
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:12,839
If he did it, he deserves it.

210
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:15,211
No, I don't want you
to get into it.

211
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:19,677
Janie, would you relax?

212
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:22,051
I'm not going to do anything
you don't want me to do.

213
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:25,683
- Okay.
- Just get in and stay here...

214
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,693
until it's better.

215
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:33,124
Then help me
if you want to help me.

216
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,328
Call Michael Jones.

217
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:38,837
He's in the book.

218
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:40,839
Tell him he's got to
substitute for me.

219
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:43,569
Then I want you to call Arlene.

220
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:47,342
I don't know where she is.
Tell her I won't be in for a while.

221
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:48,847
Okay?

222
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,113
Admissions!

223
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:59,158
She's in Admissions, I think.

224
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:02,622
I'm booked this week.

225
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:04,630
Can you get somebody
to fill in until next week?

226
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:07,690
Yeah, okay. Thanks anyway.

227
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:10,531
- I'll give you a call next week.
- Okay. Bye.

228
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:44,166
So I need a teaching certificate...

229
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:47,070
and put me on the computer...

230
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,472
at the school registry
by tomorrow morning.

231
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,169
Oh, Rem?

232
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:55,305
Give me some good academic
credentials. I mean good ones.

233
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:58,408
Yeah, whatever.

234
00:20:58,485 --> 00:20:59,918
Name?

235
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:04,787
Something unusual.
Smith. James Smith.

236
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:30,699
- Morning, Jerome.
- Hey, man.

237
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:35,112
How are you doing, Rolanda?
Great.

238
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:38,309
Manuelo, you need a haircut, son.

239
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:42,455
Good morning.
Can I help you?

240
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:45,582
Maybe. I'm looking
for Miss Hetzko's room.

241
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:47,785
My name's Smith.
I'm her substitute.

242
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:50,227
- Claude Rolle. I'm the principal.
- Good to meet you.

243
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:52,491
You're not one of our
regular subs.

244
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:55,625
She wanted Michael Jones,
but he was booked so he called me.

245
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:58,227
Well, good. I'll point you
in the right direction.

246
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,932
- Thank you.
- Janie's ill?

247
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:03,635
- She got mugged.
- No.

248
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,611
That's terrible.

249
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,375
Hey, put that skateboard
in your locker.

250
00:23:09,449 --> 00:23:13,510
- Is she okay?
- Apparently, but I don't know her.

251
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:17,920
Can't be too careful these days.
She's a fighter. She'll pull through.

252
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:19,549
Jimenez, you're late.

253
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:22,459
- Upstairs, first class you see.
- Thank you.

254
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:25,498
Bring your paperwork to the office,
or you won't get paid.

255
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:28,398
Hey. Good luck.

256
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:32,269
Okay, let's move it.
Get to class. You're late.

257
00:23:59,332 --> 00:24:01,732
Miss Hetzko's class?
Let's go.

258
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:04,770
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the substitute. Come on.

259
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,809
Okay, Romeo, that's enough.
Break it up.

260
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,094
Good morning, class.

261
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:44,933
My name is Mr. Smith.

262
00:24:47,113 --> 00:24:50,241
I will be Miss Hetzko's substitute
for the next few days.

263
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:53,012
Is Miss Hetzko taking a break?

264
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:55,020
Is that what happened?

265
00:25:02,395 --> 00:25:04,363
Mother, we ain't in church.

266
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,863
Okay.

267
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,254
Henry Alvin.

268
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:18,534
Henry Alvin.

269
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:20,545
Over here.

270
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:23,740
If you can't talk, Henry,
just raise your hand.

271
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:31,648
If so many of you can't talk,
it's going to be more quiet in here.

272
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:38,163
Henry Alvin.

273
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,827
Lisa Rodriguez.

274
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,235
Bitch.

275
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:48,699
- Michael Davis.
- You all seen Michael?

276
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:51,710
That's right. He's in the hall
rubbing your mom's booty, man.

277
00:25:55,648 --> 00:25:57,741
- Frank Davis.
- Yo.

278
00:25:57,817 --> 00:26:00,684
I'm Frank.
He's just messing with you.

279
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:03,415
- You two brothers?
- No. He wishes he was.

280
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:06,481
Get off that damn
government cheese.

281
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,794
Juan Lacas.

282
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,914
That was sharp, dude.

283
00:26:30,984 --> 00:26:33,714
Sure was sharp.

284
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:36,254
What era of history
are you studying now?

285
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:37,482
The fuck-you era.

286
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:42,220
And what have you covered so far?

287
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:45,264
The button of that
ferret ass you got.

288
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,666
- Who won World War II?
- Your mama, man.

289
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:55,972
And... here comes a tough one...
who discovered America?

290
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:57,134
Fat mama.

291
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,562
- What's your name?
- I'm Jerome, dog.

292
00:27:01,597 --> 00:27:02,844
- What's your name?
- I'm Jerome, dog.

293
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:05,213
A 16-inch woofer from Opa-Locka.

294
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:07,446
Straight from the bottom.

295
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,920
- Go up there, kid.
- Yeah.

296
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:11,752
Opa-Locka, never drop-a

297
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:15,157
Tie them on my peoples
Keep it real 'cause it's lethal

298
00:27:15,228 --> 00:27:17,856
Ain't nothing sweet, dude
Miami has us down

299
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,057
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:27,873
That bouncer's dead, yeah.

301
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:36,372
That's real special, Jerome.

302
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:44,656
Are you responsible
for this coffee, Hannah?

303
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:46,817
Don't start with me, Darryl.

304
00:27:47,994 --> 00:27:51,395
I know it's yours... it stays black
after you pour cream in it.

305
00:27:56,402 --> 00:27:59,371
- You're subbing for Jane Hetzko?
- Right.

306
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,464
Darryl Sherman, English and Drama.

307
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:03,839
- Jim Smith. Good to meet you.
- You too.

308
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:07,412
Is it true they broke
her kneecap?

309
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:11,079
- That's what I heard.
- Sons of bitches.

310
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,845
I get my hands on them,
I'll show them a thing or two.

311
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,912
Life is too short
to mess with the K.O.D.

312
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:20,186
I'm Hannah Dillon,
School Librarian.

313
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:24,218
- Jim Smith. Good to meet you.
- Stay away from the coffee.

314
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:25,389
You drink it.

315
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:27,399
I'm immune.

316
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:31,801
Excuse me.
What is the K.O.D.?

317
00:28:31,871 --> 00:28:34,931
The "Kings of Destruction,"
the top gang in the school.

318
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,999
"Posse," please. You're so unip.

319
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:42,548
Could they have been responsible
for what happened to Miss Hetzko?

320
00:28:42,615 --> 00:28:45,448
- It's possible.
- Possible?

321
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:49,284
Nothing happens around here
that isn't inspired by the K.O.D.

322
00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:51,289
Or "KOD," as I think of them.

323
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:55,051
Why would they have been after her?

324
00:28:55,128 --> 00:28:58,689
Lacas threatened her.
She wanted him transferred.

325
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:02,792
- Juan Lacas?
- Yeah, he's the leader of the K.O.D.

326
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:05,099
He's a pain in the ass,
is what he is.

327
00:29:05,171 --> 00:29:07,639
Why wasn't he just transferred?

328
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:11,040
Ask Rolle.
It was his decision.

329
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,102
Criticize Rolle all you want.
He was a cop and knows the law.

330
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,444
No evidence, no case. Period.

331
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:19,610
That's right, Darryl.
You keep the faith.

332
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:28,485
If Hannah had her way,
we'd go back to the days...

333
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:31,462
when you could bludgeon a kid
for looking at you cross-eyed.

334
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:33,863
I know. I went to school here.

335
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,225
Rolle was a cop?

336
00:29:37,303 --> 00:29:41,296
Yeah, the gang unit.
He's an amazing man.

337
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,012
Excuse me, Mr. Rolle?

338
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,640
I'm looking for Juan Lacas's file.
The secretary said you had it.

339
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:52,911
The file is under review
at the moment, Mr...

340
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:55,687
- Smith.
- Smith. Right.

341
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:57,347
If it was Petarusky, I'd remember.

342
00:29:58,591 --> 00:29:59,922
Come on.

343
00:30:02,328 --> 00:30:04,262
Have a seat.

344
00:30:05,998 --> 00:30:08,558
Speaking of unusual commitment...

345
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:12,866
how is it that a cop
becomes a high school principal?

346
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:14,873
You want the short version?

347
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:17,842
I was at the Liberty City riots
in 1980...

348
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,310
not the best time to be
a black cop in Miami.

349
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,780
You watch your own neighborhood
burn down...

350
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,318
people you grew up with
getting shot and busted.

351
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:29,380
You suddenly face a clear choice.

352
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:32,788
Devastation or education.

353
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:34,622
I chose the latter.

354
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:36,924
I went to night school,
got my certificate...

355
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:39,988
got my masters,
and now here I am.

356
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:42,296
And running for city council,
I hear.

357
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:44,863
If the voters are wise.

358
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:47,804
What's your background, Mr. Smith?

359
00:30:47,874 --> 00:30:51,833
Standard liberal arts education.
I was a government bureaucratic worker.

360
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:54,038
Mostly in Health, Education
and Welfare department.

361
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:59,583
Then, uh, I guess, like you,
I wanted to teach.

362
00:31:00,753 --> 00:31:03,381
You won those scars
in the halls of academe?

363
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,690
No. Nuns, eighth grade.

364
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:12,325
Well, you better get back to work.

365
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,266
I really can't issue those files
to a temporary employee.

366
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:18,496
- Sorry.
- No problem at all.

367
00:31:18,571 --> 00:31:21,404
Thanks for your time.

368
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:23,942
Oh, I've got to ask.

369
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,706
Doesn't it make you nervous
wearing a watch like that around here?

370
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:29,213
This watch was a gift
from the Junior League.

371
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:31,682
Anyone trying to take this watch
will have to take this arm.

372
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:35,744
It's been known to happen.
They hack them off with chain saws now.

373
00:31:36,722 --> 00:31:39,384
Students in Wood Shop
made these for me.

374
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:43,724
Every year at first assembly,
I give a little demonstration.

375
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:51,933
Power perceived...

376
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:54,939
is power achieved.

377
00:31:57,677 --> 00:32:00,874
I'd remember that little truism,
Mr. Smith.

378
00:32:00,947 --> 00:32:03,472
It will assist you greatly
in your teaching.

379
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:29,469
- Nice tie.
- We don't need any insurance.

380
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:31,476
We might.
You haven't heard the gig yet.

381
00:32:31,544 --> 00:32:32,772
Tell us what it is.

382
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:36,437
- It's something different.
- Who gives a shit?

383
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:39,973
I just want to get back
in the action.

384
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:43,112
- It's a school.
- Damn! It is a school.

385
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:45,487
- I told you, man.
- What kind of school?

386
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:47,992
A high school.
I'm substituting there.

387
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,893
- Substitute for what?
- For Janie.

388
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:53,523
She got kneecapped by a gang.
She's in the hospital now.

389
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,897
Oh, shit.

390
00:32:55,968 --> 00:33:00,302
We all feel bad for Janie, right?
But a high school?

391
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,170
What's in it for us?

392
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,507
Well, probably nothing up front...

393
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:08,638
but there might be something
on the back end.

394
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,619
Maybe something on the back end.

395
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:16,519
You mind telling me what the fuck
is wrong with this picture?

396
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:18,853
First you turn down Wolfson.

397
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:21,859
Now you want us to go do a job
at a high school on deferment.

398
00:33:21,927 --> 00:33:25,192
- Hollan, chill out.
- Chill out yourself!

399
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:28,131
High school is bullshit, man.

400
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,169
You all know what's wrong.
You ain't got the guts to say it.

401
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:33,831
- Why don't you tell us, Hollan?
- I'll tell it, man.

402
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:37,808
Cuba wimped you out.
You lost your mind and your balls.

403
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:39,344
Maybe I'll borrow yours.

404
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:43,047
On second thought,
maybe they're too small.

405
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:45,049
Fuck you, man!

406
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:46,846
Fucking queers.

407
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,322
No promises, but I'm telling you,
there's something wrong there.

408
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:59,330
They're not doing their homework?

409
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:04,202
All I can tell you...

410
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,103
is these kids are walking around
with cellular phones and pagers...

411
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:09,107
and driving $50,000 BMWs.

412
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:11,109
There's drugs, and where
there's drugs there's cash.

413
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:14,544
We're not going to walk
out of there empty-handed.

414
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:17,207
It's your decision.
You tell me.

415
00:35:22,848 --> 00:35:25,214
Violation, violation.

416
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,155
Good morning, class.

417
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:42,331
Today...

418
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:44,392
we're going to talk
about Vietnam.

419
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,801
Viet who?

420
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:47,498
Fuck that shit.

421
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:01,983
You had to be resourceful
in Vietnam.

422
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:03,988
You had to grow eyes
in the back of your head.

423
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:06,649
You're a dead motherfucker!

424
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:10,627
I don't like disorder in my room.
Clean it up, Tay.

425
00:36:13,365 --> 00:36:15,856
Knock that nigger out,
my nigger.

426
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:17,027
Fuck you!

427
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:22,302
You're gonna fuck that nigger up?
He represent K.O.D.

428
00:36:22,374 --> 00:36:24,365
Stay down there
until it looks spotless.

429
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:28,409
Ah, man, look at him, dog.

430
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,414
All red and embarrassed.

431
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,677
Shut up, Jerome.

432
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:34,912
And you, hand over the ice pick.

433
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:36,682
I ain't got no ice pick.

434
00:36:36,755 --> 00:36:39,417
This is my class, Rodriguez.

435
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:41,356
I don't allow weapons in here.

436
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:43,725
This ain't your class, bitch.
I'll carry what I want.

437
00:36:43,796 --> 00:36:45,388
Take that Superman shit
somewhere else.

438
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,690
It's impolite to stick your finger
in somebody's chest.

439
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:51,133
Would you like it
if I did that to you?

440
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:53,171
Hand over the ice pick, please.

441
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:57,502
Thank you.

442
00:36:58,444 --> 00:36:59,604
Sit down.

443
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,168
You broke my hand.

444
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:04,273
I bent it. I don't break them
on the first offense.

445
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:12,852
I'm in charge of this class.
I'm the warrior chief.

446
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:18,022
I'm the merciless god of anything
that stirs in my universe.

447
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:24,095
You fuck with me
and you will suffer my wrath.

448
00:37:30,142 --> 00:37:31,302
Yeah.

449
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:33,675
Can I go to the nurse's office?

450
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:35,939
Sure, Rodriguez.

451
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:38,006
Go ahead.
Take Tay with you.

452
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,916
- Come on, bitch.
- Man, take this with you.

453
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:51,729
Anybody else want to go?

454
00:37:53,365 --> 00:37:55,925
Okay, let's get back
to Vietnam.

455
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:02,240
Anybody know where it is?

456
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:04,636
It's in Korea?

457
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:10,974
We facilitated a day care program...

458
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,019
so young mothers can come back
to school and still see their children.

459
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:16,054
Fuck! Ah, no!

460
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,715
Excuse me.

461
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:22,022
Get me some ice or something.
This is killing me.

462
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:24,289
- What's going on here?
- Ask Mr. Smith.

463
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:27,491
- I'm suing this fucking place.
- Stop that language.

464
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:31,634
Marvin, we've got trouble
in room 3B.

465
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:35,703
Hey, get to class.

466
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:42,437
I was a member of a special ops
team called "Mercs. "

467
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:45,813
Long-range reconnaissance teams
that were choppered to the jungle...

468
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:48,318
in areas along
the Ho Chi Min Trail.

469
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:52,687
Fighting with these
native mountain tribes.

470
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:55,719
When we'd run out of bullets...

471
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,592
we'd have to take the weapons...
their AK-47s...

472
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:00,825
off the enemy dead
and use their ammo.

473
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:03,595
That way we could keep fighting,
keep advancing.

474
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:06,502
That sounds like a Saturday night
in Miami, you know?

475
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,534
My uncle got his legs
blown off in Vietnam...

476
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,941
but he doesn't talk about it.

477
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:15,446
- We were there because of Hitler?
- Fuck no, dog.

478
00:39:15,514 --> 00:39:17,573
That's World War I
you're talking about.

479
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,173
No, those were earlier wars.

480
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:21,344
We were in Vietnam
to fight Communism.

481
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,151
That's why my family left Cuba...
because Castro turned Communist.

482
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:27,192
- Uh-huh.
- What's up, Mr. Smith?

483
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:29,193
How many people did you kill
in Vietnam?

484
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:33,496
I never counted.

485
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:36,966
Mr. Smith,
you lost any homeboys?

486
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,028
I lost some homeboys.

487
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:43,871
Me too, dog.
Mostly drive-bys, though.

488
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:48,106
You ever been shot,
Mr. Whatever Your Name Is?

489
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,704
Sucker.

490
00:39:52,918 --> 00:39:54,442
Yeah, I've been shot.

491
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,250
Check this out.
I've been sliced and shot.

492
00:39:57,322 --> 00:40:00,382
Fuck that shit.
I got shot, you know.

493
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:03,951
I got an AK in the leg.
That's what I'm talking about.

494
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:09,734
See you.

495
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:56,241
Two of your students are in the
nurse's office talking a lawsuit.

496
00:40:56,315 --> 00:40:58,112
Why, is the nurse a lawyer?

497
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:03,684
Corporal punishment is not allowed
in the Dade County school system.

498
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:05,950
It wasn't corporal punishment.
It was self-defense.

499
00:41:06,024 --> 00:41:09,619
And power achieved
is power perceived.

500
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,165
Well, I will admit
you got their attention.

501
00:41:15,234 --> 00:41:18,829
Which is good,
but I can't afford a lawsuit.

502
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:21,702
Now, if you were to apologize
to these two young men...

503
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:24,105
Oh, that'll be the fucking day.

504
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:28,607
Then you leave me no choice.
I have to let you go.

505
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:31,349
No, wait a minute.

506
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:34,010
You can't fire me
without two weeks' notice...

507
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:36,520
not unless you want a public hearing
in front of the school board.

508
00:41:36,588 --> 00:41:39,489
Hey, you do what you have to do.

509
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,458
On the other hand,
I want to be fair.

510
00:41:48,534 --> 00:41:50,331
You take your two weeks.

511
00:41:51,403 --> 00:41:53,030
Thanks. That's all I wanted.

512
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:03,948
- James Smith.
- Here we are.

513
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:07,816
- He's in the computer?
- Yes.

514
00:42:07,886 --> 00:42:10,821
- What's his background?
- Smith, James.

515
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:13,619
He's a Harvard grad
with a masters from Yale.

516
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,260
Wait, make that
two masters from Yale.

517
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:21,163
This guy is amazing.
And wow... a Ph. D. From Princeton.

518
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:24,969
You laid it on a little thick.

519
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:27,972
What do you want
on such short notice?

520
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,033
I'm starting to think he's taking
this teaching shit seriously.

521
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:01,138
You don't have to help me.
I'm not a baby.

522
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,152
I'll get it. Easy.

523
00:43:19,524 --> 00:43:21,583
I'm home!

524
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,026
I don't have any groceries
or Percocet.

525
00:43:24,096 --> 00:43:26,121
My God, look at the mail.

526
00:43:26,198 --> 00:43:28,393
Leave that stuff alone
and get something to eat.

527
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:30,833
Why didn't you bring it to me?
I could have done something.

528
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:33,268
I was just sitting there,
doing nothing.

529
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:39,407
Miss Hetzko, this is Jim Smith.

530
00:43:39,478 --> 00:43:41,912
I want to tell you that everything
is under control at school.

531
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,211
Get better and don't worry.
Talk to you later.

532
00:43:45,284 --> 00:43:47,946
Under control?
Is he teaching them at gunpoint?

533
00:43:48,854 --> 00:43:51,516
This is the "Miami Herald,"
and I just...

534
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:16,113
What is it?

535
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:26,254
"Miss H, you were the only
teacher who cared about me.

536
00:44:29,027 --> 00:44:31,518
Please get well
and don't give up on us.

537
00:44:31,596 --> 00:44:33,894
Love, Lisa Rodriguez. "

538
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:41,202
- That was very nice.
- Yeah.

539
00:44:41,273 --> 00:44:44,106
Don't cry. Sit down
and have a shrimp roll.

540
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:46,110
I'm not crying.

541
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:49,704
Smith probably made her
send it anyway.

542
00:44:49,781 --> 00:44:51,976
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- How do you know?

543
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,211
I don't know, okay?

544
00:44:54,286 --> 00:44:58,416
But it figures a few kids
might send you a card on their own.

545
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,755
It's obvious you have never
taught at Columbus High.

546
00:45:28,787 --> 00:45:31,722
Ladies, go to class.
Let's go.

547
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:41,258
So the war in Vietnam
was about turf.

548
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:44,131
The gangs in the north wanted
to take over the turf...

549
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:46,136
of the gangs in the south.

550
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:48,138
Look who made it.

551
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:54,910
You're late, Juan.
That'll be one demerit.

552
00:45:56,681 --> 00:45:58,615
One demerit?

553
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:03,249
Do I write "I'm sorry" ten times
on the blackboard?

554
00:46:05,424 --> 00:46:09,019
No, you're going to
write it 100 times.

555
00:46:12,998 --> 00:46:14,863
Let's go.

556
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:19,864
Life is a chess game, Juan.
This is a crucial move.

557
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:23,597
I want you to think it over.

558
00:46:39,357 --> 00:46:42,485
You're the one who should have
thought it through, motherfucker.

559
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:46,190
Believe me, I have, Juan.
I have.

560
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,692
Freddy Krueger, knock it off.

561
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,361
This is not a manicure shop.

562
00:46:54,206 --> 00:46:56,697
- Get some real nails, girl.
- These are real, baby.

563
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,644
- Fuck you all.
- Hey, really?

564
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:03,180
Jerome, you know what your name
means in Apache?

565
00:47:03,248 --> 00:47:05,148
No. What does it mean?

566
00:47:05,217 --> 00:47:06,616
Geronimo.

567
00:47:09,654 --> 00:47:13,988
That word Apache in their language
means "the outcast," "the shunned ones. "

568
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:18,257
Like their emblem, like players
today... outlaws, bandits.

569
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:22,596
That translates easy enough into
the biker gangs of the '50s and '60s.

570
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:25,761
- My times.
- The Beaver days.

571
00:47:25,837 --> 00:47:30,331
Yeah, I belonged to
a group called the Dragons.

572
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:31,898
What were the black bikers?

573
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,036
What were the brothers?

574
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:35,670
They were called the Chaplains.

575
00:47:37,716 --> 00:47:40,344
- The Chaplains were black?
- What, they wore penny loafers?

576
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:44,915
They were the biggest, baddest
black group of the '50s.

577
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,288
Where I grew up, it was
the Dragons and the Enchanters.

578
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,691
The Enchanters were the girls.

579
00:47:55,867 --> 00:47:57,459
How old were you?

580
00:47:57,536 --> 00:48:02,303
I was 12 years old
when I became a Junior Dragon.

581
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:04,308
So Mr. Smith was a bad ass, huh?

582
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,704
So, Mr. Smith, what were some
of the other black gangs?

583
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,044
Gangs died out a little bit
in the late '60s...

584
00:48:11,116 --> 00:48:14,210
but it came back in the '70s.

585
00:48:14,286 --> 00:48:17,380
There was a gang
called the Black Spades.

586
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,981
So these Black Spades
were like homeboys?

587
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:24,460
All homeboys, 5,000 strong
all over the city of Miami.

588
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:27,623
Dang! Fucked up.

589
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:32,734
If there were 5,000, why are we
sitting in this classroom?

590
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:38,267
Okay. What's the future
of staying in a gang?

591
00:48:38,343 --> 00:48:39,674
Bitches.

592
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:41,941
Money, whores and clothes.

593
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:47,283
Yeah, yeah.

594
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:49,081
Maybe a one-way ticket to the joint?

595
00:48:49,154 --> 00:48:52,248
Got ya. I wanna get high.

596
00:48:52,324 --> 00:48:55,885
- Straight up, smoking.
- I didn't mean that, Rodriguez.

597
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:57,588
I'm talking about the joint.

598
00:48:57,662 --> 00:49:00,756
You know, Raeford Prison upstate?

599
00:49:02,634 --> 00:49:05,865
That can't happen, Mr. Smith.
We're all juveniles.

600
00:49:05,937 --> 00:49:08,098
Until you're 18, then they
throw your ass in a cell...

601
00:49:08,173 --> 00:49:10,971
and you become a punk
or somebody's sweet boy.

602
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:14,034
- You're gonna get fucked in jail.
- They've got to catch me first.

603
00:49:15,113 --> 00:49:17,911
What are we supposed to do,
work in some fast food joint...

604
00:49:17,983 --> 00:49:20,315
making minimum wage or something?

605
00:49:20,385 --> 00:49:22,148
Better than a gang funeral.

606
00:49:25,357 --> 00:49:26,847
How many of those you been to?

607
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:29,120
Too many.

608
00:49:30,295 --> 00:49:32,229
Too fucking many.

609
00:49:33,632 --> 00:49:35,497
Is that what you want
for yourselves...

610
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:40,537
what you want for your kids?

611
00:49:43,675 --> 00:49:45,404
How many of you have kids?

612
00:49:48,713 --> 00:49:50,044
You got a kid?

613
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,810
How many of you want them
to be in gangs?

614
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:56,881
Why not, if it's so great?

615
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:59,753
But it's different
when you talk about your kids.

616
00:49:59,824 --> 00:50:01,883
Why?

617
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,555
You don't want to see your kids
get in trouble, get hurt or busted.

618
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,862
I don't want to see you kids
get hurt or get busted.

619
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:11,731
What are we supposed to do?

620
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,832
I'm not going to bullshit you.
I don't have all the answers.

621
00:50:20,945 --> 00:50:24,108
But I'd like to see
all of you survive.

622
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:02,543
Mr. Smith.

623
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,680
I want to commend you
on the way you handled Lacas.

624
00:51:05,757 --> 00:51:07,987
The best part is
you did it without violence.

625
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:10,823
I like that. I tell you what.

626
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:15,264
Come by my office after the faculty
meeting and we'll talk, okay?

627
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,665
Okay.

628
00:51:23,074 --> 00:51:25,736
Put those out
and get to class.

629
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:40,253
Today after the faculty meeting.

630
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:02,102
- You're too slow!
- Bullshit, man.

631
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:25,902
Wait 'til he's off school grounds.

632
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,371
I don't want to kill him right off.
I want to cut him up first.

633
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,374
To the left!

634
00:52:46,457 --> 00:52:47,651
Look at him.

635
00:52:47,725 --> 00:52:49,659
He's scared shitless.

636
00:52:49,727 --> 00:52:51,251
Shit.

637
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:04,040
Marvin, we have a code ten
in the front hall.

638
00:53:29,934 --> 00:53:32,630
Hannah, get down behind
the desk now. Get down!

639
00:53:32,704 --> 00:53:35,195
You stay there 'til
I tell you to come out.

640
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:50,180
All right, that's good enough.
Freeze right there.

641
00:53:50,255 --> 00:53:51,620
Put your weapons in the can't.

642
00:53:52,724 --> 00:53:53,816
Let's go!

643
00:53:59,831 --> 00:54:00,923
You, push it over.

644
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,233
Easy.

645
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,274
That's good.

646
00:54:11,342 --> 00:54:13,572
Hannah, come out here, sweetheart.

647
00:54:13,645 --> 00:54:15,272
Come on.

648
00:54:17,282 --> 00:54:20,217
Look, I want you to roll this
into your office.

649
00:54:20,285 --> 00:54:21,946
Are you listening to me?

650
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,318
Roll this in your office,
lock the door...

651
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:27,358
wait 15 minutes,
then call the police.

652
00:54:27,425 --> 00:54:29,916
You got that? Go on.

653
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,938
Oh, I can't tell you boys
how much I've needed this.

654
00:54:50,782 --> 00:54:53,512
When we're done, I want you
to say "I'm sorry" 100 times.

655
00:54:53,584 --> 00:54:55,848
Shh. No talking in the library.

656
00:54:57,055 --> 00:54:59,216
It's time you boys
started hitting the books.

657
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,657
Here's one... required reading.
"Catcher In The Rye. "

658
00:55:02,727 --> 00:55:05,719
- My mistake. Did I say "catcher"?
- Move in!

659
00:55:14,906 --> 00:55:17,704
Marvin.

660
00:55:38,062 --> 00:55:39,927
Checkmate, motherfucker.

661
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,012
911? I'd like to report
an accident.

662
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,523
Shit!

663
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:17,492
Um, sorry. My mistake.

664
00:56:36,988 --> 00:56:39,548
He's toast.
Kill this bitch and split.

665
00:57:48,593 --> 00:57:50,527
I'm sorry about those windows.

666
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:53,826
Hey, fuck it.

667
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:13,006
You wanted to see me.

668
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:18,119
It's a little late.

669
00:58:19,491 --> 00:58:22,051
Okay. There's always tomorrow.

670
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:31,492
- Who is it?
- Hey, hey!

671
00:58:31,569 --> 00:58:33,662
Sherman? Oh, man!

672
00:58:33,738 --> 00:58:36,298
Open the door. Come on.

673
00:58:36,374 --> 00:58:38,433
Hurry up. Look... for you.

674
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:40,444
For me? Wow!

675
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:44,073
Oh, man, they're so beautiful.
I need them.

676
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,640
Thank you. Hi.
Thank you so much.

677
00:58:46,718 --> 00:58:49,050
- Let me take those.
- Let me hold them... they're mine.

678
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,418
You just sit on the couch.

679
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:54,185
- You got that?
- I'm better. I'm so strong.

680
00:58:54,259 --> 00:58:56,352
- How's your knee?
- It's great.

681
00:58:56,428 --> 00:58:59,625
- I'm sorry I didn't come by sooner.
- That's okay.

682
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:05,802
Hey, you look like a cripple.

683
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,963
- What's that?
- What's what?

684
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:10,837
These are the hairdos
that I wish I had.

685
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:12,171
Is that me?

686
00:59:12,243 --> 00:59:13,801
Yeah, that's you.

687
00:59:13,878 --> 00:59:16,403
I want my hair to be like yours,
and they wouldn't do it.

688
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:19,507
Let's talk about school.
Everybody thinking about me?

689
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:21,108
Nope.

690
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:24,178
That substitute you hired is amazing.
Where'd you find him?

691
00:59:24,255 --> 00:59:26,689
- Shale found him.
- Shale?

692
00:59:26,758 --> 00:59:29,249
Yeah, the guy I met
in Nicaragua.

693
00:59:30,328 --> 00:59:33,058
Yeah? Is that picture
in Nicaragua?

694
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:34,393
Yeah.

695
00:59:34,466 --> 00:59:37,629
- What were you doing in Nicaragua?
- I was teaching.

696
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:41,832
He was in the military. One of those
on-again, off-again relationships.

697
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,451
- What are you telling me?
- You tell me what happened.

698
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,216
I don't know,
but something's going on.

699
00:59:58,289 --> 01:00:00,814
- He can't be no fucking teacher.
- I'll worry about him.

700
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:04,384
Just do what you're supposed to,
and don't call me here again.

701
01:00:23,715 --> 01:00:27,173
Wellman, it's Joey.
They're switching cars.

702
01:00:27,252 --> 01:00:31,712
I'm at the fruit stand on Griffin Road.
Get over here as soon as possible.

703
01:00:48,606 --> 01:00:50,733
- Where'd you get those?
- Darryl Sherman sent them.

704
01:00:53,178 --> 01:00:56,614
- Is he a teacher?
- Mm-hmm.

705
01:00:56,681 --> 01:00:58,444
What have we got here?

706
01:00:58,516 --> 01:01:01,041
- I hope you're hungry.
- Mm-hmm.

707
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,054
Arroz, plantains,
habichuelas negras.

708
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:06,647
- This must be the flan.
- Where are you working?

709
01:01:06,724 --> 01:01:08,954
And palomilla.

710
01:01:09,027 --> 01:01:11,495
- Home security.
- Home security?

711
01:01:11,563 --> 01:01:13,758
Those are two words I never
would have associated with you.

712
01:01:13,832 --> 01:01:18,496
- Doing what?
- Planning people's security systems.

713
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:20,697
- I hope you're hungry.
- I am.

714
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:22,467
I'd love to have some rice.

715
01:01:31,182 --> 01:01:33,480
Darryl told you?

716
01:01:35,453 --> 01:01:36,545
May I explain?

717
01:01:37,689 --> 01:01:39,782
Go ahead.

718
01:02:49,494 --> 01:02:51,519
See, it's not just the K.O.D.

719
01:02:53,765 --> 01:02:56,461
Rolle's in on this too.

720
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:03,339
Does that mean my classroom
is going to turn into...

721
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:05,808
your own private
little drug war?

722
01:03:05,877 --> 01:03:09,677
No, I just want them out
of there, same as you do.

723
01:03:09,747 --> 01:03:11,840
- Why should you care?
- I didn't at first.

724
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:13,850
But you do now?

725
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:21,915
The other day I was talking
and happened to glance back.

726
01:03:21,993 --> 01:03:25,053
- The weirdest thing happened.
- What?

727
01:03:27,398 --> 01:03:29,161
They were listening.

728
01:03:33,705 --> 01:03:37,436
I don't know.
I guess I felt like, you know...

729
01:03:37,508 --> 01:03:40,306
Like you were actually teaching.

730
01:03:41,479 --> 01:03:42,571
Yeah.

731
01:03:44,248 --> 01:03:47,684
Oh, I remember the feeling.

732
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:43,236
Hello.

733
01:04:43,307 --> 01:04:45,138
Hi, Joey.

734
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:47,677
Fine. Yes, he's here.

735
01:04:53,651 --> 01:04:55,050
Where are you?

736
01:04:56,421 --> 01:04:57,979
I'll be there in ten minutes.

737
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,991
- I've got to go.
- Mm-hmm.

738
01:05:08,933 --> 01:05:10,730
- Janie.
- Yeah?

739
01:05:10,802 --> 01:05:13,202
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
It's up to you.

740
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:16,798
I just want what I've always wanted...
that you be straight with me.

741
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:20,903
That's hard when your whole life's
a covert operation.

742
01:05:30,054 --> 01:05:31,402
Where is this guy?

743
01:05:31,437 --> 01:05:32,750
Where is this guy?

744
01:05:32,824 --> 01:05:35,384
You can always count on him.

745
01:05:51,509 --> 01:05:52,601
What's going on?

746
01:05:52,677 --> 01:05:57,205
He pulled a car switch
at the fruit stand on Griffin Road.

747
01:05:57,281 --> 01:05:59,215
It's owned by an Indian
named Johnny Glades.

748
01:05:59,283 --> 01:06:02,081
- You heard of him?
- Yeah. The drug dealer?

749
01:06:02,153 --> 01:06:05,145
No, reputed.
He's never been convicted.

750
01:06:05,223 --> 01:06:08,681
The police surveil him all the time
and never turn up shit.

751
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,990
That's the Indian
that hit Janie.

752
01:06:11,062 --> 01:06:13,326
Yeah, he's the muscle.

753
01:06:13,397 --> 01:06:16,264
The other asshole must be
the one who knows how to count.

754
01:06:18,302 --> 01:06:20,736
Lacas supplying Glades.

755
01:06:20,805 --> 01:06:23,603
If that ain't the tail
wagging the dog, huh?

756
01:06:26,811 --> 01:06:28,574
Got him.

757
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,004
Here. Check it out.

758
01:07:14,392 --> 01:07:15,950
It's right.

759
01:07:22,066 --> 01:07:24,728
You take the boat.
The Indian's mine.

760
01:07:27,772 --> 01:07:30,605
I can't believe these guys.
They're two hours late.

761
01:07:30,675 --> 01:07:32,643
- It's the same old horseshit.
- Freeze.

762
01:07:34,512 --> 01:07:36,878
Hey there, big guy.

763
01:07:36,948 --> 01:07:39,473
Get on the ground, on your faces,
arms out at your side.

764
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:42,041
- Fuck!
- Let's go.

765
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:44,679
Goddamn it, Bull.

766
01:07:53,264 --> 01:07:54,663
Your friend's boat's sinking.

767
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,346
You don't know who you're
fucking with, asshole.

768
01:08:10,381 --> 01:08:11,980
You don't know who you're
fucking with, asshole.

769
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:17,012
Payback time.
Get up, linebacker boy.

770
01:08:17,822 --> 01:08:20,188
Yeah, you, dummy!
Go on, get up.

771
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:25,061
It's your lucky day, man.
Come on. Kick his ass.

772
01:08:26,264 --> 01:08:29,597
That looks like it hurts.
Lay into him, boy!

773
01:08:30,668 --> 01:08:33,501
Kick yourself a field goal!

774
01:08:33,571 --> 01:08:35,596
I'll be damned.
He can kick too.

775
01:08:41,379 --> 01:08:44,542
Not fair, Shale!
No goddamned ninja horseshit.

776
01:08:58,863 --> 01:09:00,194
Took you long enough.

777
01:09:01,465 --> 01:09:04,127
- No thanks to you, asshole.
- Payback's a bitch.

778
01:09:05,036 --> 01:09:06,298
I guess we're even.

779
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:08,361
- You fucking psycho.
- Oh, yeah?

780
01:09:15,246 --> 01:09:17,942
Who's a fucking psycho?

781
01:09:23,688 --> 01:09:27,215
- I knew you'd come back.
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.

782
01:09:31,095 --> 01:09:33,723
What do you want
to do with this?

783
01:09:36,867 --> 01:09:38,801
Hey! No, no!

784
01:09:43,474 --> 01:09:46,136
Dade County,
South fucking Florida.

785
01:09:57,755 --> 01:10:00,019
Early morning joggers
made a grisly discovery...

786
01:10:00,091 --> 01:10:03,356
the results of what police believe
was a drug deal gone bad.

787
01:10:03,427 --> 01:10:05,861
Detectives have been
combing the scene all morning.

788
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:08,490
They're looking for clues
and trying to establish...

789
01:10:08,566 --> 01:10:10,500
if the victims were killed here...

790
01:10:10,568 --> 01:10:14,231
or killed at another location
and their bodies dumped here.

791
01:10:14,305 --> 01:10:16,603
Toxicology tests will be
performed on the bodies.

792
01:10:16,674 --> 01:10:19,074
- Results won't be known for weeks.
- Hello.

793
01:10:19,143 --> 01:10:22,510
- Claude!
- Yeah?

794
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:25,515
Half a million bucks!
What's going on, Claude?

795
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:28,381
- I wish I knew.
- You know, they shot Bull.

796
01:10:28,452 --> 01:10:31,615
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I want you to hear something.

797
01:10:31,689 --> 01:10:34,487
- Hear what?
- Come on, he was my buddy!

798
01:10:35,326 --> 01:10:38,693
Hear what happens to who's responsible
if I don't get my money back.

799
01:10:50,441 --> 01:10:51,806
What was that all about?

800
01:10:53,344 --> 01:10:55,369
Nothing.

801
01:11:08,225 --> 01:11:09,658
Lacas!

802
01:11:12,663 --> 01:11:17,566
Did you rip off Johnny Glades?
Lie and I'll rip your head off!

803
01:11:17,635 --> 01:11:19,125
Me?

804
01:11:19,203 --> 01:11:21,569
Did you tell anybody
about the buy last night?

805
01:11:21,639 --> 01:11:25,075
- Look at me, goddamn it!
- I did what I was supposed to.

806
01:11:25,142 --> 01:11:27,804
Then I split.

807
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:31,336
You think those Indians
want me knowing their business?

808
01:11:31,415 --> 01:11:34,680
Well, somebody found out,
and we could be in deep shit.

809
01:11:44,528 --> 01:11:46,587
Everybody, we've got
some announcements here.

810
01:11:46,664 --> 01:11:49,258
The reclamation committee
has generously donated...

811
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,233
some equipment
to Columbus High School.

812
01:11:51,302 --> 01:11:54,863
They'll be giving it out
on the field in five minutes.

813
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:56,804
We've got sports equipment...

814
01:11:58,142 --> 01:12:02,010
VCRs, laptop computers and books...

815
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,071
musical instruments, art supplies
and lab equipment.

816
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:07,947
And pizza for everybody...
no anchovies.

817
01:12:15,426 --> 01:12:19,795
You don't teach history anymore.
You are history.

818
01:12:19,864 --> 01:12:22,230
Don't these people
belong in class?

819
01:12:36,046 --> 01:12:38,640
Brand-new tubas for the band.

820
01:12:42,987 --> 01:12:46,013
Jerome, find your best friend
with your wife or something?

821
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:48,320
Yeah, that's why I divorced her.

822
01:12:52,163 --> 01:12:55,462
What's up, man?
What's going on?

823
01:12:55,533 --> 01:12:58,798
I saw how you handled them boys
yesterday. I liked that.

824
01:12:58,869 --> 01:13:01,099
As a matter of fact,
you're my dog now.

825
01:13:01,172 --> 01:13:03,265
As a matter of fact,
check it.

826
01:13:04,642 --> 01:13:07,440
- S-Dog.
- Thanks, Jerome.

827
01:13:07,511 --> 01:13:09,638
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- No doubt.

828
01:13:12,449 --> 01:13:13,814
Check you later.

829
01:13:19,456 --> 01:13:20,684
What?

830
01:13:21,759 --> 01:13:23,784
Mr. Shale.

831
01:13:25,996 --> 01:13:28,430
- It's Smith. Be cool.
- Oh, I'm cool.

832
01:13:28,499 --> 01:13:31,059
So this is a personal mission
or a joint operation...

833
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:34,127
between the CIA and the PTA?

834
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:37,900
I'm just messing with you.

835
01:13:37,975 --> 01:13:40,603
You're trying to get the K.O.D.,
and I want to help.

836
01:13:40,678 --> 01:13:42,942
- Forget it.
- What do you mean?

837
01:13:43,013 --> 01:13:46,847
You're the great white hope who's
gonna show us how to clean things up?

838
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:48,248
This is my school.

839
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:51,618
I'm the one that's still
going to be here after you leave.

840
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:54,089
If there's a problem,
I want to help.

841
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:56,353
All right, Mr. S-Dog?

842
01:13:56,427 --> 01:13:58,361
All right.

843
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:00,822
What do you want me to do?

844
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:04,395
Nothing.

845
01:14:04,468 --> 01:14:06,493
The next move is Rolle's.

846
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,266
Rolle? What does he
got to do with it?

847
01:14:12,343 --> 01:14:15,141
He's in business with Lacas
and a drug dealer named Johnny Glades.

848
01:14:15,212 --> 01:14:18,841
- No, man, that's bullshit.
- No, it's true.

849
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:22,215
I don't know how they work it yet,
but it's a matter of time.

850
01:14:22,286 --> 01:14:25,517
The man has done too many things
for the community to be involved...

851
01:14:25,589 --> 01:14:28,353
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say anything.

852
01:14:28,425 --> 01:14:30,655
- Now I know what this is about.
- What's that?

853
01:14:30,728 --> 01:14:34,824
Politics. When you have a black man
running for office, making changes...

854
01:14:34,898 --> 01:14:37,423
you got a white man
trying to run him down.

855
01:14:37,501 --> 01:14:39,594
He's dealing drugs, Darryl.

856
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:41,604
That's bullshit.

857
01:14:52,516 --> 01:14:55,178
Johnny, that money you lost?

858
01:14:55,252 --> 01:14:57,447
I know where it went.

859
01:15:02,259 --> 01:15:03,692
Beautiful.

860
01:15:07,197 --> 01:15:10,633
Tilt those little puppies
over here, baby.

861
01:15:10,701 --> 01:15:12,134
One for you.

862
01:15:14,004 --> 01:15:15,938
And one for me.

863
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:20,733
To the very, very generous
Mr. Smith.

864
01:15:23,647 --> 01:15:27,276
Hey, what do you expect
from a Harvard, Princeton...

865
01:15:27,351 --> 01:15:30,081
Cornell, Rutgers, Yale grad?

866
01:15:31,388 --> 01:15:34,755
It's too bad most of my students
think that Yale is a lock.

867
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:39,454
Okay, let's talk about
this parent-teacher conference.

868
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:42,055
Come on, Janie,
I don't want to talk shop tonight.

869
01:15:42,132 --> 01:15:44,157
It's tomorrow night.
You've got to be briefed.

870
01:15:44,234 --> 01:15:46,862
I know. I just tell the parents
what the kids are doing.

871
01:15:46,937 --> 01:15:49,167
- It's so easy.
- I want you to be positive.

872
01:15:49,239 --> 01:15:53,437
I want you to think of one
good thing for every student.

873
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:56,638
You have to educate and encourage
the parents as much as the kids.

874
01:15:56,714 --> 01:15:59,842
- Oh, God! So itchy.
- Not again.

875
01:15:59,917 --> 01:16:02,545
Why does it always have to itch
at a spot where I can't reach it?

876
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:04,553
Oh, please.

877
01:16:05,989 --> 01:16:07,923
- Here, let me.
- I can't get it.

878
01:16:07,991 --> 01:16:10,357
- Let me try from here.
- It's right here.

879
01:16:14,231 --> 01:16:16,256
Oh, please hurry, Shale.

880
01:16:19,269 --> 01:16:22,466
Higher, higher. Okay.

881
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:45,527
I can't get higher through your...

882
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:49,532
I'm going to have to
come in from up top.

883
01:16:51,068 --> 01:16:52,535
You dog.

884
01:16:53,437 --> 01:16:56,406
- What?
- "What?"

885
01:16:56,473 --> 01:16:58,407
You know what.

886
01:17:00,344 --> 01:17:01,777
Come over here.

887
01:17:42,019 --> 01:17:43,167
Attention, parents and teachers.

888
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:44,316
Attention, parents and teachers.

889
01:17:44,388 --> 01:17:47,016
School will be closing
in five minutes.

890
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:50,253
Five minutes. Thank you.

891
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:58,094
Lisa, you're still here.

892
01:17:58,168 --> 01:18:01,035
Yeah, I was helping Miss Adams
with some refreshments.

893
01:18:01,104 --> 01:18:03,038
There are some boys outside
that are bugging me.

894
01:18:03,106 --> 01:18:05,131
Do you mind if I just
wait here for a while?

895
01:18:05,209 --> 01:18:07,803
Sure, have a seat.
I've got some papers to finish.

896
01:18:07,878 --> 01:18:10,142
I'll be done in a minute.

897
01:18:15,352 --> 01:18:17,377
That's all I've got on Arturo.

898
01:18:17,454 --> 01:18:20,446
Miss Hetzko will have to
fill you in on the rest.

899
01:18:20,524 --> 01:18:23,584
- Thanks for coming in, Miss Suarez.
- Thank you.

900
01:19:29,459 --> 01:19:30,892
Yes?

901
01:19:33,397 --> 01:19:34,830
Good.

902
01:19:41,605 --> 01:19:44,506
I'm doing good, so I don't know
what else I'm supposed to do.

903
01:19:44,575 --> 01:19:47,544
If you want, I'll be happy
to talk to her.

904
01:19:47,611 --> 01:19:49,738
That would be good.

905
01:19:49,813 --> 01:19:52,748
Huh. What the hell is this?

906
01:19:52,816 --> 01:19:55,444
Have your mama call me,
and we'll set up a time...

907
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:57,453
when we can get toge...

908
01:19:58,589 --> 01:20:01,183
These doors shouldn't be locked.

909
01:20:01,258 --> 01:20:05,092
Come on, we'll go out
through the basement.

910
01:20:07,364 --> 01:20:10,891
There's a security office down here.
They'll let us out.

911
01:20:14,972 --> 01:20:18,464
- You need a ride home?
- It's not out of your way?

912
01:20:18,542 --> 01:20:20,533
No, not at all.

913
01:20:24,281 --> 01:20:25,942
At least an hour and a half.

914
01:20:26,016 --> 01:20:27,449
Shit.

915
01:20:37,761 --> 01:20:39,194
Lacas.

916
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:08,083
Come on, come on. Down here.

917
01:21:13,363 --> 01:21:15,831
You guys go that way.
You come with me.

918
01:21:22,572 --> 01:21:24,767
Whatever happens, stay put.

919
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:26,365
- But, Mr. Sherman...
- No, listen.

920
01:21:26,443 --> 01:21:29,310
Tell Smith everything, okay?

921
01:21:34,818 --> 01:21:37,343
Got the guy. Over here!

922
01:21:49,266 --> 01:21:51,291
Here we go.

923
01:21:52,736 --> 01:21:54,670
Come down. You're going to
make me go up there and get you?

924
01:21:54,738 --> 01:21:57,866
- Where are you going, Darryl?
- Fuck you, Rolle!

925
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:07,181
You're going down, Rolle.
Smith is putting you away.

926
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,741
Smith's dead, Darryl.
Drive-by. Very ugly.

927
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,082
You're a liar!

928
01:22:11,154 --> 01:22:13,918
I know. It upset me too.

929
01:22:14,658 --> 01:22:17,354
Give it up, Darryl.
It's over, get it?

930
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:28,233
Nice aim.

931
01:22:28,305 --> 01:22:30,398
Fuck you, Rolle!

932
01:22:32,309 --> 01:22:35,836
Shame you have to end up this way,
crawling like a worm.

933
01:22:37,047 --> 01:22:38,412
That's how you lived,
so why not?

934
01:22:38,482 --> 01:22:41,076
At least I didn't sell out
my own people!

935
01:22:41,151 --> 01:22:42,618
Sell out?

936
01:22:44,621 --> 01:22:46,680
I look at you,
and you know what I see?

937
01:22:47,758 --> 01:22:51,091
I see me when I was young
and stupid.

938
01:22:51,161 --> 01:22:52,856
I see me when I was soft.

939
01:22:53,764 --> 01:22:56,961
That just don't cut it.

940
01:23:00,036 --> 01:23:02,596
Young man...

941
01:23:02,672 --> 01:23:05,266
I'm just doing you a favor.

942
01:23:45,816 --> 01:23:47,306
Who died?

943
01:23:48,752 --> 01:23:49,912
You did, sir.

944
01:23:51,788 --> 01:23:53,483
I guess I am a little late.

945
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:16,342
Mr. Smith, what's going on?

946
01:24:16,413 --> 01:24:18,881
They said you got wasted
in some drive-by.

947
01:24:18,949 --> 01:24:20,780
- Who said that?
- Rolle.

948
01:24:20,851 --> 01:24:22,978
The principal made an announcement
over the loudspeaker this morning.

949
01:24:23,053 --> 01:24:25,920
- That's what we heard.
- Told us about Sherman too.

950
01:24:25,989 --> 01:24:29,481
- What about Mr. Sherman?
- Somebody found his body.

951
01:24:29,559 --> 01:24:31,493
- Wasted.
- Shot in the head.

952
01:24:31,561 --> 01:24:33,927
- What happened?
- I don't know.

953
01:24:35,432 --> 01:24:39,198
- Let's take this guy out right here.
- Like you did last time?

954
01:24:39,269 --> 01:24:42,170
Either he's an undercover cop
or working for the mob.

955
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:46,141
- How did he become Hetzko's substitute?
- Maybe you should ask her.

956
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:49,474
Harvard, Princeton, my ass.
I should have my head examined.

957
01:24:49,546 --> 01:24:52,811
I don't know where he is,
Mr. Smith.

958
01:24:52,883 --> 01:24:57,081
He has nothing on his calendar
until 3:30.

959
01:24:57,153 --> 01:25:00,281
What's at 3:30?

960
01:25:00,357 --> 01:25:03,588
A Mr. Wolfson
at the jai alai fronton.

961
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,685
Thanks.

962
01:25:07,063 --> 01:25:08,189
Jerome.

963
01:25:09,933 --> 01:25:14,233
I have to go someplace.
I need you to take over my class.

964
01:25:14,304 --> 01:25:15,430
You're fucking with me?

965
01:25:15,505 --> 01:25:17,905
No, I'm counting on you, son.

966
01:25:22,712 --> 01:25:26,409
Yo, Mr. Smith asked me
to teach you motherfuckers today.

967
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:31,252
- Babe, you the teacher?
- Mr. Smith hitting the crack pipe?

968
01:25:32,522 --> 01:25:34,752
The only crack around here
is in your head.

969
01:25:34,824 --> 01:25:37,850
I'll keep it open real good
if you don't pay attention.

970
01:25:38,662 --> 01:25:40,789
I'm Mr. Brown to you now.

971
01:25:40,864 --> 01:25:42,798
I'm the substitute for Mr. Smith.

972
01:25:42,866 --> 01:25:45,391
You dis me,
you're dissing Mr. Smith.

973
01:25:45,468 --> 01:25:48,904
Rodriguez, you're late.
That's one demerit.

974
01:25:48,972 --> 01:25:51,702
I need to see Mr. Smith.
Where is he?

975
01:25:51,775 --> 01:25:54,869
Jerome, it's important.

976
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:32,514
Wolfson!

977
01:26:33,917 --> 01:26:36,408
Shale, what a surprise.

978
01:26:37,554 --> 01:26:40,216
Tell me about Rolle
and Johnny Glades.

979
01:26:41,424 --> 01:26:43,824
Who? I never heard of them.

980
01:26:43,893 --> 01:26:46,384
You ever heard of getting
a cesta shoved up your ass?

981
01:26:46,463 --> 01:26:49,398
Jesus Christ, man.
What are you, nuts?

982
01:26:49,466 --> 01:26:51,764
You can't come into a public place
and threaten people.

983
01:26:51,835 --> 01:26:54,099
- I'll call the police.
- Go ahead.

984
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:56,138
Just hold it right there.

985
01:26:56,206 --> 01:26:58,333
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

986
01:26:58,408 --> 01:26:59,739
I will defend myself.

987
01:27:22,832 --> 01:27:25,300
Okay, you got me.

988
01:27:25,368 --> 01:27:28,030
- Can we be reasonable about this?
- Sure.

989
01:27:29,139 --> 01:27:30,333
Jesus!

990
01:27:30,407 --> 01:27:33,843
- Tell me about Glades and Rolle.
- I don't know anything.

991
01:27:34,677 --> 01:27:36,770
Ah! Goddamn!

992
01:27:36,846 --> 01:27:38,313
God, I'm enjoying this.

993
01:27:38,381 --> 01:27:41,077
Listen to me now.

994
01:27:41,151 --> 01:27:43,619
All I know is they wanted me
to hire some people...

995
01:27:43,686 --> 01:27:46,519
to bodyguard the incoming shipment,
and that's all I know.

996
01:27:46,589 --> 01:27:49,080
Is that the gig
me and Janus were up for?

997
01:27:49,159 --> 01:27:52,651
I wanted you, Shale. I told him,
"Obviously this guy's the best. "

998
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:55,495
Flattery's gonna get you killed.

999
01:27:56,299 --> 01:27:59,393
How long has Rolle
been on Glade's payroll, huh?

1000
01:27:59,469 --> 01:28:01,494
I don't know. No!

1001
01:28:01,571 --> 01:28:04,563
I know he was getting paid off
when he was a cop.

1002
01:28:04,641 --> 01:28:07,906
When he became a teacher,
they started funneling the drugs...

1003
01:28:07,977 --> 01:28:10,309
through the school,
and that's it.

1004
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:12,211
How'd they do it?

1005
01:28:14,017 --> 01:28:16,542
The K.O.D., I guess.

1006
01:28:16,619 --> 01:28:18,610
The K.O.D., they said.

1007
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:21,748
But I don't know how they store it
and how they transport it.

1008
01:28:21,825 --> 01:28:23,850
I don't know any of that shit.

1009
01:28:23,927 --> 01:28:27,260
You're killing me!
You have no reason to kill me.

1010
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:29,821
Once I'm going to be reasonable.

1011
01:28:29,899 --> 01:28:32,891
You're going to leave the country
and not come back, or I'll kill you.

1012
01:28:32,969 --> 01:28:37,030
Otherwise, I'll be unreasonable.
Am I clear?

1013
01:28:37,107 --> 01:28:38,574
If you don't hit me again.

1014
01:28:59,295 --> 01:29:01,229
- You're sure?
- Yeah. Three.

1015
01:29:07,637 --> 01:29:10,629
- Hello?
- It's Jerome and Lisa.

1016
01:29:27,957 --> 01:29:32,792
Mr. Smith,
this is Jane Hetzko.

1017
01:29:32,862 --> 01:29:36,889
I've got those papers graded,
if you could pick them up.

1018
01:29:36,966 --> 01:29:38,058
Thank you.

1019
01:30:30,286 --> 01:30:32,379
- Come here.
- Okay.

1020
01:30:32,455 --> 01:30:34,889
Don't be stupid, you hear me?

1021
01:30:38,261 --> 01:30:39,888
- Who is it?
- Shale.

1022
01:30:41,898 --> 01:30:43,661
- Who's Shale?
- A friend of mine.

1023
01:30:43,733 --> 01:30:46,031
Get rid of him.

1024
01:30:46,102 --> 01:30:49,936
- I can't talk to you now.
- I brought you something from Smith.

1025
01:30:50,006 --> 01:30:52,133
Okay, buzz him in.

1026
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:01,644
I'll be right here.

1027
01:31:11,294 --> 01:31:13,194
Take the package.

1028
01:31:16,065 --> 01:31:18,431
- Hi.
- Hola.

1029
01:31:20,803 --> 01:31:23,271
Shale, the kids!

1030
01:31:29,012 --> 01:31:31,572
Mr. Whatever Your Name Is,
you're in my classroom now.

1031
01:31:34,984 --> 01:31:37,214
- You're no teacher. Who are you?
- Leave him alone!

1032
01:31:39,188 --> 01:31:40,450
Stay down.

1033
01:31:40,523 --> 01:31:43,754
- Who is he?
- He's a merc.

1034
01:31:45,128 --> 01:31:49,394
A merc?
You hired a fucking merc?

1035
01:31:49,465 --> 01:31:50,955
Get me the phone.

1036
01:31:52,602 --> 01:31:53,665
I don't know what he's after,
who he's working for.

1037
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:54,728
I don't know what he's after,
who he's working for.

1038
01:31:54,804 --> 01:31:58,035
All I know is he wanted to know
if you two had a deal.

1039
01:31:58,107 --> 01:32:00,234
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

1040
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,938
You think I'd be here
if I told him anything?

1041
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:07,416
- Do you know this Shale guy?
- Yeah, he did the Cuba raid.

1042
01:32:07,483 --> 01:32:09,974
He's the guy I told you about
at Wolfsors place.

1043
01:32:10,053 --> 01:32:11,953
The guy that made you
shit in your pants.

1044
01:32:12,021 --> 01:32:14,751
Again with that.
That was the fiber.

1045
01:32:16,626 --> 01:32:18,753
- I need my money now.
- What's the hurry?

1046
01:32:18,828 --> 01:32:22,696
I have a plane to catch
in 40 minutes. My father...

1047
01:32:22,765 --> 01:32:25,165
He's extremely ill,
and I have to go see him.

1048
01:32:26,336 --> 01:32:28,270
Get him his money.

1049
01:32:34,711 --> 01:32:38,579
Sounds like this Smith
and Shale are working together.

1050
01:32:38,648 --> 01:32:42,140
Right. A merc working
with a high school teacher?

1051
01:32:42,218 --> 01:32:44,311
He's not a teacher.
That's a cover.

1052
01:32:44,387 --> 01:32:47,185
He's either a narc or a dealer
trying to muscle in.

1053
01:32:53,329 --> 01:32:55,297
Yeah, hello. Talk.

1054
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,434
You're shitting me.

1055
01:33:00,937 --> 01:33:02,928
You've got to be shitting me.

1056
01:33:05,074 --> 01:33:07,838
I don't care who he is.
When we hang up, kill him.

1057
01:33:14,183 --> 01:33:15,775
Are we enjoying this?

1058
01:33:17,253 --> 01:33:20,654
Jane, what's all the racket?

1059
01:33:21,724 --> 01:33:25,057
- It's my landlady.
- Will you open up?

1060
01:33:25,128 --> 01:33:27,062
Get rid of her
or she dies too.

1061
01:33:32,902 --> 01:33:35,666
- What's all the banging in there?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Andrewson.

1062
01:33:35,738 --> 01:33:37,968
- I had the TV on too loud.
- What's wrong with your face?

1063
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,668
I'm fine.
I'll turn the TV down.

1064
01:33:46,215 --> 01:33:47,842
Take him out!

1065
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:49,043
Goddamn it, take him out!

1066
01:33:54,223 --> 01:33:56,589
Give it up!

1067
01:33:58,661 --> 01:34:00,322
Drop it or she dies.

1068
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:02,563
Now!

1069
01:34:05,435 --> 01:34:08,427
Slow. Now back up.

1070
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,503
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1071
01:34:18,981 --> 01:34:20,346
Lights out, motherfucker.

1072
01:34:51,214 --> 01:34:53,978
It's not your fault.

1073
01:35:04,193 --> 01:35:06,218
What were you two
doing here anyway?

1074
01:35:07,463 --> 01:35:09,954
- Looking for you.
- Why?

1075
01:35:11,567 --> 01:35:15,298
Rolle was bringing in dope on buses
and storing it in the boiler room.

1076
01:35:16,205 --> 01:35:19,800
Mr. Sherman led them away from me
so they wouldn't find me.

1077
01:35:19,876 --> 01:35:22,436
That's when they killed him.

1078
01:35:33,422 --> 01:35:35,356
Stay here. It'll be safe.

1079
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,390
Where are you going?

1080
01:35:40,463 --> 01:35:44,422
I have to go to the high school.
I've got to get the drugs.

1081
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,730
You think Rolle and Johnny Glades
are going to let you...

1082
01:35:46,802 --> 01:35:50,397
just walk in and take their drugs?

1083
01:35:50,473 --> 01:35:52,703
If we get there first.

1084
01:36:01,183 --> 01:36:03,879
There's a key to the house.

1085
01:36:03,953 --> 01:36:05,215
If anything happens to me...

1086
01:36:06,355 --> 01:36:08,550
I want you to have this place.

1087
01:36:13,963 --> 01:36:16,397
I don't want you to go.

1088
01:36:20,036 --> 01:36:21,230
I'll be back, Jane.

1089
01:36:23,272 --> 01:36:26,070
You better.

1090
01:36:26,142 --> 01:36:27,234
I will.

1091
01:36:57,106 --> 01:36:58,596
Goodness!

1092
01:37:05,648 --> 01:37:07,741
He thinks he's funny, don't he?

1093
01:37:11,487 --> 01:37:12,784
Joey, get that.

1094
01:37:20,329 --> 01:37:21,421
Hello?

1095
01:37:23,165 --> 01:37:24,257
Yeah.

1096
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:27,359
Louie Beaver says he's seen
Shale and some other guys...

1097
01:37:27,436 --> 01:37:29,904
going into the school.

1098
01:37:29,972 --> 01:37:32,202
Tell them to sit tight
and keep a lookout.

1099
01:37:53,329 --> 01:37:54,455
Oh, shit.

1100
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:07,275
Car approaching north perimeter.

1101
01:38:08,477 --> 01:38:10,411
Be right there.

1102
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:12,979
Looks like we got our company.

1103
01:38:13,049 --> 01:38:16,485
Don't worry. I'll throw them
a real nice surprise party.

1104
01:38:16,552 --> 01:38:17,985
Good.

1105
01:38:42,278 --> 01:38:44,769
That's far enough right there,
Rolle.

1106
01:38:47,516 --> 01:38:49,609
Just take it easy.

1107
01:38:49,685 --> 01:38:51,880
I just want to make a deal.

1108
01:38:51,954 --> 01:38:53,717
Your deal sucks, Mr. Principal.

1109
01:38:53,789 --> 01:38:55,950
Then tell us your terms.

1110
01:38:56,025 --> 01:38:59,324
Quite simple: I want it all.

1111
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:01,321
Keep him talking.

1112
01:39:01,397 --> 01:39:04,764
- I can't do that, Shale.
- It's done, Claude.

1113
01:39:04,834 --> 01:39:07,598
You start anything now, you'll
bring the cops down on all of us.

1114
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:09,900
Don't worry about the cops.
They're taken care of.

1115
01:39:09,972 --> 01:39:11,906
Anyway, you need us, Shale.

1116
01:39:11,974 --> 01:39:13,908
For what?

1117
01:39:13,976 --> 01:39:16,809
You won't be able to work
without our distribution system.

1118
01:39:16,879 --> 01:39:18,847
What's so good about it?

1119
01:39:18,914 --> 01:39:22,213
It's foolproof...
we bus it in, store it...

1120
01:39:23,252 --> 01:39:25,550
use the K.O.D. To mainline it
directly into the school system.

1121
01:39:25,621 --> 01:39:27,282
You can't do better than that.

1122
01:39:27,356 --> 01:39:29,847
They said busing would never work.

1123
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:34,088
Sniper in the palm tree.

1124
01:40:13,602 --> 01:40:16,901
There's more company moving in.

1125
01:40:16,972 --> 01:40:18,064
There are two groups.

1126
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:20,267
Janus and his men
are going around the back.

1127
01:40:20,342 --> 01:40:21,969
Hollan, watch your back
down there.

1128
01:40:25,381 --> 01:40:27,713
And also around the side.

1129
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:10,651
Oh, shit!

1130
01:41:20,269 --> 01:41:22,260
Move it!

1131
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:29,338
Let's go!

1132
01:42:03,879 --> 01:42:05,972
The lock is broken.
Check the stuff.

1133
01:42:06,048 --> 01:42:07,481
Hurry!

1134
01:43:24,326 --> 01:43:25,623
Smile.

1135
01:43:25,694 --> 01:43:28,060
You're on candid camera.

1136
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,964
All right, Shale, you got me.
What are you gonna do?

1137
01:43:34,036 --> 01:43:35,970
I'm gonna put you
on my demo reel.

1138
01:43:37,373 --> 01:43:40,342
Now, walk over to the blackboard
and face it.

1139
01:43:42,244 --> 01:43:43,677
Easy.

1140
01:43:45,447 --> 01:43:46,607
"I'm sorey"?

1141
01:43:48,150 --> 01:43:51,415
It's a special mantra for flunkies.
Put the weapon down.

1142
01:44:41,036 --> 01:44:42,367
Boom.

1143
01:44:49,211 --> 01:44:50,644
Rem?

1144
01:44:53,215 --> 01:44:55,149
Wellman.

1145
01:44:56,785 --> 01:44:58,377
- Shit.
- Shale.

1146
01:44:58,454 --> 01:45:00,718
I got four dead cowboys here...

1147
01:45:00,789 --> 01:45:03,383
and one very fucked-up-looking
Indian, Johnny Glades.

1148
01:45:03,459 --> 01:45:06,257
Can I put him out of his misery,
pretty please?

1149
01:45:06,328 --> 01:45:09,263
No, wait 'til I get there,
Hollan.

1150
01:45:13,435 --> 01:45:15,369
You hear that, Johnny?

1151
01:45:15,437 --> 01:45:19,100
As soon as Shale gets here,
I'm gonna scalp you, motherfucker.

1152
01:45:24,913 --> 01:45:27,541
You know what you look like
with that shit all over your face?

1153
01:45:27,616 --> 01:45:30,449
You look like a little snow angel
at the top of a Christ...

1154
01:45:38,994 --> 01:45:41,292
Shale, watch out. It's a trap.

1155
01:45:47,269 --> 01:45:48,827
Watch that door.

1156
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,634
Where the fuck is he?

1157
01:46:16,565 --> 01:46:18,055
Drop them.

1158
01:46:27,943 --> 01:46:29,877
Where's my guy?

1159
01:48:23,091 --> 01:48:25,025
Get up!

1160
01:48:32,701 --> 01:48:35,431
Who are you working for, Shale?
Who are you working for?

1161
01:48:35,504 --> 01:48:37,836
- Myself.
- Yeah, right. A great teacher.

1162
01:48:37,906 --> 01:48:40,534
You're a mercenary, in it for
the money like everybody else.

1163
01:48:40,609 --> 01:48:43,009
- It was never about the money.
- It's always about the money.

1164
01:48:43,078 --> 01:48:45,046
If it's not about the money,
what else is there?

1165
01:48:46,648 --> 01:48:50,448
I'd try to explain it to you,
but some things just can't be taught.

1166
01:49:24,152 --> 01:49:25,585
Oh, God.

1167
01:49:26,655 --> 01:49:27,917
I thought I lost you.

1168
01:49:27,989 --> 01:49:30,355
Not this time, Joey.

1169
01:49:35,997 --> 01:49:37,726
Rem and Wellman?

1170
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,669
Hollan too.

1171
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:56,747
You're just gonna stand there...

1172
01:49:56,818 --> 01:49:59,446
bleeding and shit,
making a mess?

1173
01:50:02,357 --> 01:50:04,291
Let's get out of here.

1174
01:50:07,062 --> 01:50:10,259
Cops have got great response time.
What'd it take them, three hours?

1175
01:50:10,332 --> 01:50:13,233
Rolle said they were on his payroll.
What do you expect?

1176
01:50:13,301 --> 01:50:16,896
It's definitely time to relocate.

1177
01:50:16,972 --> 01:50:18,462
Yeah.

1178
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:20,633
It's too bad we had to
fuck up the school.

1179
01:50:20,709 --> 01:50:22,700
I feel bad for the kids tomorrow.

1180
01:50:22,778 --> 01:50:25,406
They'll be okay.
At least it's their school again.

1181
01:50:27,616 --> 01:50:31,279
Yeah. Where the hell
are we gonna go, man?

1182
01:50:31,353 --> 01:50:34,186
Ah, how does L.A. Sound?

1183
01:50:34,256 --> 01:50:36,190
Like more palm trees.

1184
01:50:36,258 --> 01:50:38,249
I hear the schools out there
have a major drug problem.

1185
01:50:38,326 --> 01:50:41,887
No. No more schools, man.
Forget it.

1186
01:50:41,963 --> 01:50:44,659
- You could teach P.E.
- P.E.?

1187
01:50:44,733 --> 01:50:46,530
What, I look retarded?

1188
01:50:46,601 --> 01:50:49,331
- Okay, math.
- Fuck that.

1189
01:50:50,305 --> 01:51:50,569
Watching movies won't make you rich.
