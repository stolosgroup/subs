174
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,500
Why we backtracking to Mississippi
instead of going to 'Bama?

175
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,170
Seem like we should
just go on from here,

176
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,070
maybe do a longer run in Mobile,
even add Huntsville.

Where you from?

193

- Blue Goose Hollow.
- A who what?

194
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,280
That a street name?

195

Bessie: <i>Where I'm from,
they don't have no street names.</i>

(Chuckles) That where your people from, too?

They died a long time ago.

198

Well, the loneliest thing
in the world

is a motherless child.

200

Well let me shave you dry.

They don't amount
to much, do they?

203
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,100
You on your own.

- Ma: <i>I heard you in the show. I know you can sing.</i>

So stay or jump, bitch.
(Chuckles)

209
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,010
- Well, the train is--
- I don't give a damn about the train,

210
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,950
a thunderstorm,
a shotgun or what.

211
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,450
You just got to decide
for yourself.

212
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Hell, you got
the St. Louis blues,

213
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,890
the Chicago blues,
the Gin House blues,

214
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,290
the "my man
done left me" blues.

215
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,300
They all the same song,
ain't they?

216
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,330
With the same three chords.

217
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,600
And you done heard 'em about a dozen
hundred times from a dozen hundred people.

218
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,140
So what make folks
wanna hear from you?

219
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,240
<i>So you got to put</i>
<i>something else in it.</i>

220
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,710
The blues is not about
people knowing you.

221
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,980
It's about
you knowing people.

222

<i>(Train whistle blowing)</i>

Who done that
to you, huh?

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,970
Big old girl like you
letting folks beat on you.

226
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,070
This look like
it might stay forever.

<i>(Liquid pouring)</i>

What you doing fanning yourself around here for?

229
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,180
Shut the door good
on your way out.

230

Where you going without my sugar, though?

231
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,830
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,760
What you grinning about,
Blue Goose?

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,030
What you know about it?

234
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,060
Same thing you know.

What's your name,
pretty lady?

237
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,900
Bessie Smith.

238
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,840
Miss Bessie Smith.

<i>(Music playing)</i>

- How many seats in the house?

241
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,980
- 200.
- I counted 250.

Ah, I meant 200 plus,
give or take.

243

And you sure
eager to take.

- She need to be here?
- Ma: She needs to understand

245
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,620
why TOBA stands
for "Tough On Black Asses."

246
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,760
Actually, it stands for Theater
Owners Booking Association, T-O-B--

- What's the cover?
- <i>A nickel.</i>

248

Hmm, newspaper ad

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,330
- Well, we don't always--
- $12.50.

250

- Pardon me?
- That's 10 cents times 250 seats.

$12.50 in advance

We have no way of knowing

how many people
are actually gonna show up.

We'll refund
your no-shows.

Boy, aren't you getting
a hell of a deal?

260
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,690

Like I'm about to fall.

That's how it should feel every night.

269

If you're not
risking nothing,

270

neither will they.

271

Right there.
How about her?

274
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,540
Three rows back

- Mm-mmm.
- Yeah.

Yeah, that look
like her.

00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,150
Don't nobody wanna see you
up there chewing like a cow.

462
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,090
- Where do I put it?
- Hold it in your damn hand, Hattiesburg.

463
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,930
(Whispers)
Five, six, seven, eight.

464
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,290
Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

465
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,530
What is that?

466
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,270
Um, I'm dancing, ma'am.

467
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,070
- <i>I wanna--</i>
- You better sing something first.

468
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,340
<i>(Stammering)</i>
<i>I don't know how to sing.</i>

469
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,910
You don't know
how to sing?

470
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,510
You wanna be in my show,
you have to be able to sing,

471
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,110
dance, and tell
a damn joke or two.

472
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,550
(Clears throat)

473
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,150
¶ Well, I woke up
this morning-- ¶

474
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,290
That's enough.
Clarence, give her the bag test.

475
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,460
What you grinning for?

476
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,030
You failed.

477
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,200
You must be darker than the bag to be in my show.

478
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,360
Now get going with
your high-heeled ass.

479
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,070
- Next!
- Clarence: <i>Etta Johnson, Bell Buckle, Tennessee.</i>

480
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,940
Bell Buckle?
Lord!

481
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,240
No yellow bitches.

482
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,170
- (Yelps)
- Next!

483
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,980
- Next!
- What if I didn't pass your bag test?

484
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,150
- I never give you no test.
- Oh, you test me... daily.

485
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,290
No, you--
you tell me.

486
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,560
Come on, Lucy.

487
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,330
No.

488
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,260
I wanna know.

489
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,330
Would you still
love me?

490
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,170
You'd still be you.

491
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,170
And how would you
know that?

492
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,570
You know how I feel.

493
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,540
Then I need you
to say it.

494
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,610
- You know.
- No, I don't know.

495
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,250
You know.

496
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,050
Then say it.

497
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,820
It wouldn't matter.

498
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,150
It wouldn't matter,
what?

499
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,520
It wouldn't matter
about your color.

500
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,260
And?

501
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,230
And?

502
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,930
You know what?

503
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,170
I cares for you.

504
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,080
(Chuckles)

505
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,180
You cares for me?

506
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,050
You cares for me.
Is that all?

507
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:13,990
No, that ain't all.

508
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,360
What-- why you
acting up today?

509
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,230
I need you
to tell me something.

510
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,360
- I'm gonna show you something instead.
- (Laughing)

511
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,100
Clarence: <i>You can make this bigger.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

512
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,970
<i>It's got to say,</i>
<i>"This is Bessie Smith,"</i>

513
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,540
<i>so make this bigger and this a little bit smaller like that.</i>

514
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,410
Now, that's what-- that's what I'm talkin' about,

Clarence:
Come on. All right.

517
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,990
Clarence:
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

518
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,030

<i>Bessie Smith</i>
<i>and Her Down Home Trio.</i>

I didn't ask you what you want,
I asked you who you are.

Man: <i>Open the door and see me,
big man.</i>

543
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,930
My name is Jack Gee, ma'am,
and I'm 32 years old

544
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,760
from Titustown, Virginia,
and I schooled till the 10th grade.

545
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,730
I'm nobody's husband
and I'm nobody's daddy.

546

I make $13.75 a week working as a

550
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,150
Now, I don't believe in church,
but I do believe in God,

551
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,150
and I know it to be
the God's honest truth

552
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,750
that you're
the most beautiful woman

or any woman, period.

554
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,960
And I'm very pleased to make your
acquaintance this fine afternoon.

555
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,730

- Oh, yes.

Auditions for the show
are over.

558
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,630
I ain't auditioning
for no show.

559
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,640
I'm auditioning
to be your man.

560
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,610

You look a little small.

561

- Baby, I'm built for speed.
- Really, now?

562
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,580
Well, maybe you only
auditions women.

563

I auditions
whosoever I please.

564
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,680
I can give it
as hard as I can take it,

No, he's still auditioning.

Can I have
this dance, baby?

581
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,450
Touch her hand, Charlie,
and draw back a nub.

582
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,460
And what if I touch his?

00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,000
- Well, that's, uh--
- Well, y'all wanna hear me sing, right?

763
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,570
Yes. Yes, yes,
of course.

764
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,700
Is there anything else
that you need?

765
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,470
I need a little something
for this tea.

766
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,210
Honey, sugar, milk?

767
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,110
Splash of Old Tom
will be just fine.

768
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,710
- "Old Tom"?
- Gin?

769
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,750
I'm sorry, I-- I--

770
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,620
I don't know that we have any
or where we could find any.

771
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,990
You see, it's, ah...

772
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,050
- I mean, it's illegal.
- Never mind. It's okay.

773
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,060
No, it ain't okay.

774
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,100
You want her at her best,
then give her what she needs.

775
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,030
Oh, it's okay, papa.

776
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,500
(Vocalizing)

777
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,100
¶ Oh... ¶

778
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,510
(clears throat)
Hold up.

779
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,610
Something ain't right.

780
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,580
<i>¶ Oh-- ¶</i>

781
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,510
Ahem--
(snorts)

782
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,720
(retches)

783
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:58,020
¶ I got a man I love ¶

784
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,590
<i>¶ Why he had</i>
<i>to leave me? ¶</i>

785
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,600
<i>¶ I got a man I love ¶</i>

786
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,200
¶ Smart as he can be... ¶

787
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,540
<i>(clears throat)</i>

788
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,070
Dear Miss Smith,

789
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,840
while we appreciate your
downhome sound,

790
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,810
we do not feel
that it is a fit

791
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,710
for Black Swan Records.

792
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,320
We have chosen
to record instead

793
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,620
<i>a young lady who</i>
<i>we unanimously agree</i>

794
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,890
<i>has a more</i>
<i>compatible sound</i>

795
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,720
<i>and is a bright,</i>
<i>shining example</i>

796
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,390
<i>of the Harlem Renaissance</i>
<i>and an uplift to the race.</i>

797
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,500
<i>We hope you can appreciate</i>

798
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,160
<i>the difficulty</i>
<i>of our decision</i>

799
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,030
<i>and the choices</i>
<i>that must be made</i>

800
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,270
<i>in the name of progress.</i>

801
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,070
<i>We remain admirers</i>
<i>of your work</i>

802
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,840
<i>and hope that you will</i>
<i>keep us in mind</i>

803
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,210
<i>for your</i>
<i>future recordings.</i>

804
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,310
Jack: <i>You let her go in there and make a damn fool</i>

805
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,510
- <i>out of herself.</i>
- Pour me another glass of this corn.

806
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,210
- Ain't nobody crying.
- It was a good meeting, man.

807
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,150
<i>Hey, baby, look here.</i>
<i>Never again.</i>

808
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,980
Damn fools don't know nothing
about no talent.

809
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,720
I'm gonna get you
a real record deal!

810
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:01,920
I said I don't wanna
hear no more about it.

811
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,150
<i>What the hell you know</i>
<i>about anything?</i>

812
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,590
We've been in
this business

813
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,360
- before you were wiping your own ass.
- Look it here.

814
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,190
It's about damn time she started
taking advice from a nigger

815
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,060
that don't wear no
stage makeup!

816
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,300
Listen--

817
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,930
Give me some more
of this!

818
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,770
Give me some more
of all this stuff!

819
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,800
It'll pass.

820
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:16,790
...a couple of them
myself, too.

821
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,460
Are you sure?

822
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,400
(Chattering)

823
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,730
(laughs)

824
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:24,970
Jack: <i>Hey, Bessie.</i>

825
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,240
This here Mr. Walker--
want to meet you.

826
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,580
The hell you bring
him here for?

827
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,040
<i>You remember him.</i>

828
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,210
Brought him by a couple
of your shows.

829
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,310
He wants to talk
to you about a record deal.

830
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,280
- A real recording contract.
- Miss Smith,

831
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,550
<i>I'd like to record</i>
<i>you for Columbia Records</i>

832
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,290
<i>for our new</i>
<i>Race Records division.</i>

833
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,430
What is a Race Record?
The one where they put a coon on the front?

834
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,300
What? Um, no, ma'am.

835
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,700
We at Columbia are taking
a different approach.

836
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,430
I'm not interested
in your Race Records.

837
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:01,710
And I'm not interested in wasting my
time singing no store-bought blues.

838
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:03,140
<i>But we want your sound.</i>

839
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,340
We want
the Bessie Smith sound.

840
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,010
And it would be
your face on the ad,

841
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,280
- nothing like those other records.
- I already sell out

842
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,280
every show from
Philly to Chicago.

843
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,280
Ain't nobody doing it
like I'm doing it.

844
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,120
You'd attract
a broader audience.

845
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,020
I've been doing
just fine without 'em.

846
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,760
I can offer you
50 dollars a side.

847
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,590
No royalties, of course.

848
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,490
(Scoffs)

849
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,170
Don't play with me now.

850
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,220
J.G.

851
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,990
Now, you want
what's in my jacket

852
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,390
or in my pocket?

853
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,930
(Scoffs) I already know what's in your pocket.

854
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,800
Maybe you do,
maybe you don't.

855
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,540
Now, what do you want?

856
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,740
This or this?

857
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,540
I want another velvet box.

858
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,080
Marry me.

859
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,790
You ou can't be
putting me upon no shelf.

860
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,160
I ain't no
henpecked man, either.

861
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,200
Take the chance on me.

862
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,380
Come here, girl.

863
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,660
Now, what's in
that other pocket?

864
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,890
Oh. (Chuckles)

865
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,500
Uh, just
a recording contract

866
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,370
from Columbia Records.

867
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,970
<i>125 a side.</i>

868
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,040
That's double
what that man said.

869
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,910
That's 'cause I'm fighting
for you now, baby.

870
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,210
Well, maybe we should
tell Clarence.

871
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,680
Uh-uh. This here is
me and you now.

872
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,490
Man:
<i>All set. Let 'em know.</i>

873
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,890
Man #2:
<i>Let's hope she knows what she's doing.</i>

874
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,660
Man #3:
<i>They tell me she does.</i>

875
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,300
<i>Take a listen.</i>
<i>This always takes...</i>

876
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,670
Everything all right,
Bessie?

877
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,900
Yeah, as soon as y'all
move this thing

878
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,600
out the way,
I'm ready to go.

879
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,370
Well, no, that's
the recording apparatus.

880
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,710
- I know it's bigger than what--
- It's crowding me.

881
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,580
(Stammering)
Well, we need it to--

882
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,010
- I don't need it.
- Look, Bess, you got to--

883
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,720
Hey, hey.
I'll help her.

884
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,220
What's wrong?

885
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,290
It's gonna be just like
the last time.

886
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,390
- No, it's not.
- It ain't gonna go, J.G.

887
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,890
It ain't gonna go, J.G.
I know it.

888
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,260
I know how they do it.

889
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,560
They act like they're your pal,
and then it all comes loose.

890
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,100
You can't make no silk purse out of no sow's ear

891
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,070
- just like Viola always said--
- Damn Viola.

892
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,900
You hear me? Damn her.

893
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,670
Damn Black Swan.

894
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,810
Damn these crackers
in here.

895
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,080
Let's just go home.

896
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:34,480
Okay, we're going.
We're going now. Right now.

897
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,020
But sing one song,
honey.

898
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,520
The way you like it.

899
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,060
Don't sing it for me,
them, nobody.

900
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,060
You sing it
for yourself.

901
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,430
Now what you say?

902
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,610
Mr. Walker:
<i>Okay, here we go, Bessie.</i>

903
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,910
<i>Mr. Gee, if you could just</i>
<i>step away from the cone--</i>

904
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,380
He's staying right here.

905
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,350
Um, okay.

01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:41,180
Van Vechten: <i>I have a treat.</i>
<i>I have a special treat.</i>

1071
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,710
<i>The incomparable Bessie Smith</i>

1072
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:45,550
is going to
sing us a song.

1073
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,650
(Faint applause)

1074
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,260
¶ Everybody's cryin' ¶

1075
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,990
<i>¶ The workhouse blues,</i>
<i>all day ¶</i>

1076
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,430
¶ Oh, Lord ¶

1077
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,500
¶ Oh, Lord ¶

1078
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,770
¶ The work is so hard ¶

1079
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,180
¶ Thirty days is so long ¶

1080
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:15,080
¶ Oh, Lord ¶

1081
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:19,520
¶ I can't plough ¶

1082
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,790
¶ I can't cook ¶

1083
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:28,690
<i>¶ If I'd run away,</i>
<i>wouldn't that be good? ¶</i>

1084
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:33,660
¶ Well, I'm goin'
to the nation ¶

1085
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:39,100
¶ Goin' to the territor' ¶

1086
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:45,340
<i>¶ The workhouse sits</i>
<i>way out a ¶</i>

1087
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:50,110
¶ Long old lonesome road ¶

1088
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:55,150
¶ I'm a hard-luck gal ¶

1089
01:04:55,450 --> 01:05:00,790
¶ Get the devil
everywhere I go... ¶

1090
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,890
Mmm.

1091
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,630
Where the drinks at
around here?

1092
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,870
Let me get
a little something.

1093
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,270
You are a treasure.

1094
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,610
That was so beautiful
and so soulful,

1095
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:22,780
and, frankly,
exactly the kind of dusky pathos

1096
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:23,880
that I'm looking to capture

1097
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:24,880
for my new book
"Nigger Heaven"--

1098
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,150
- Say what?
- "Nigger Heaven," it--

1099
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,850
You know
the only difference

1100
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,260
between white folks
in the North

1101
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,690
and white folks
in the South?

1102
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,260
White folks in the South
don't care how close you get

1103
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,800
as long as you don't
get too big.

1104
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,400
And white folks in the North
don't care how big you get

1105
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:46,270
as long as you don't
get too close.

1106
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,610
(Chuckles)

1107
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,410
- Man: <i>Are you all right?</i>
- Van Vechten: <i>If Bessie Smith is crude and primitive,</i>

1108
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,350
<i>she reflects the true</i>
<i>folk spirit of her race.</i>

1109
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,370
Man:
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1110
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,100
<i>Morning, Gee!</i>

1111
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,500
I got something for you.

1112
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,410
Got somebody I want
you to meet.

1113
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:31,410
This here is Gertrude.

1114
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,180
She's a singer.
Writes songs, too.

1115
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,690
You know Claudine
dropped out in Cincinnati.

1116
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:42,990
Got pregnant.

1117
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:44,730
So I hired Gertrude
here to replace her.

1118
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,130
What the fuck you showing her
to me for?

1119
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,570
I don't know.

1120
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,770
Thought maybe you might
have something to say.

1121
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,200
Sort of like "welcome."

1122
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:56,070
What kind of fucked-up name
is Gertrude?

1123
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:57,840
- You a half-breed?
- Excuse us, please.

1124
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,140
Go on and get yourself
something to eat, baby.

1125
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,150
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1126
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,580
I know you got your
side pieces,

1127
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,280
but why you gotta
rub 'em in my face?

1128
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:08,320
I'm just trying
to build a--

1129
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,650
You want me to
sniff her for you, too?

1130
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,950
I'm just trying to build
a show here, Bessie.

1131
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,590
You got her
wearing my things.

1132
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:15,090
I know you think
<i>I'm big and ugly.</i>

1133
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:16,530
You think I'm blind
and dumb, too?

1134
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:19,730
It ain't-- it ain't like you
ain't been tipping out, too.

1135
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:22,100
I know it.
Tell me different.

1136
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,540
Look.

1137
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:38,880
Baby, I promise.
Cross my heart.

1138
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,350
I don't love
nobody else but you.

1139
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,050
And you don't love
nobody else but me,

1140
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,960
<i>so the rest really don't</i>
<i>matter now, do they?</i>

1141
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,790
<i>You know I don't think</i>
<i>what you said.</i>

1142
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,900
You're my fine woman.

1143
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:01,100
Look.

1144
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,440
Let's start over, huh?

1145
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,410
Let's me and you both
clean house.

1146
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,480
Come on.

1147
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,890
Let's try.

1148
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,210
They said you had
your own train.

1149
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,110
I didn't believe 'em.

1150
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:45,450
But goddamn, sis.

1151
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,880
You a high post
now, huh?

1152
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:51,290
You ain't tell me
about all this.

1153
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,760
- You get that money I sent you?
- Oh, yeah.

1154
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,630
I get them little wires
you've been sending.

1155
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,270
They're nice,
feeding four kids and all.

1156
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,610
Okay, look.

1157
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:23,290
I know you and I bump heads
most of the time,

1158
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,160
but I'm just here
to show my support.

1159
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:32,060
Mmm, real nice.

1160
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,700
This is from Europe and...

1161
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,330
what have you.

1162
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,150
I got you something.

1163
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:54,580
Probably not fancy enough
for you now, but...

1164
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,150
I thought you'd like it.

1165
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,050
I'm proud of you.

1166
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,590
I'm so proud of you.

1167
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,210
You gonna stay around
for a while?

1168
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:53,710
Think Clarence could
get me tickets?

1169
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,550
He's in the box office.

1170
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,490
Thank you.

1171
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,660
Bessie: Come on.
Come on and see.

1172
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:47,860
Come on in here.

1173
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:50,630
Come on.

1174
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,330
- Come on, y'all.
- Get inside.

1175
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,600
The paint already fading.

1176
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:55,100
Bessie:
<i>Take a look around.</i>

1177
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,770
(Chattering)

1178
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,440
Man:
<i>Lord have mercy.</i>

1179
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,580
Bessie: <i>Look around,</i>
<i>breathe it in.</i>

1180
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,050
Lucy: <i>This is</i>
<i>something, Bessie.</i>

1181
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:04,050
Smell different, don't it?

1182
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,150
Listen here, Bessie.

1183
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,120
We ain't talk about
getting no house.

1184
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,150
I ain't see your name
on my bank book.

1185
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:18,230
I mean,
I did it for us, papa.

1186
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,900
- I knew you'd like it.
- Man: <i>How the upstairs look?</i>

1187
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:24,530
But if you did it for us,
why all of them got to move in here for?

1188
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,640
And especially
why is she here?

1189
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,300
Baby, she's gonna be all the way back in the house.

1190
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:29,870
You ain't hardly
gonna see her.

1191
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:34,180
I don't know why certain people's got they lip turned up.

1192
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,110
Must be smelling something.

1193
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:38,550
Damn right,
I'm smelling something.

1194
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,850
Must be a dead rat
in the wall.

1195
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,280
Must be.

1196
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:45,120
Baby, stop.

1197
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:47,060
Why you ain't
ask me first?

1198
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:50,290
- See if I was ready?
- Well, I'm ready.

1199
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:53,330
I want a real family,
not no road family.

1200
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,330
I want the whole thing,
you know?

1201
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,100
A big house
and everybody in it.

1202
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:01,070
Well, everybody ain't gonna be in it if you
don't start showing me some respect!

1203
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:09,450
I'm gonna put a big piano
right here,

1204
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,910
<i>a big dining room table</i>
<i>is gonna go here.</i>

1205
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,480
I'm gonna get me a nice rug
for that parlor.

1206
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:15,680
And I'm gonna get me
a baby, too,

1207
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:16,850
and I'm gonna put him
right in there.

1208
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,090
- A what?
- Come see the-- a baby.

1209
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,260
Come on, see the kitchen.

1210
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,740
Always a pleasure.

1211
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,280
Bess?

1212
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,490
You're gonna have to start delivering.
I'm a married woman now.

1213
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:52,450
I can't keep doing
these pick-ups.

1214
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,860
No problem, ma'am.

1215
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:56,730
What do you want?

1216
01:13:57,090 --> 01:14:00,460
I'll follow you home just like this.
(Chuckles)

1217
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:04,400
You trot yourself out there swinging and dangling.
See what happens.

1218
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,640
Yeah, suits me fine.

1219
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:09,540
I don't want you for
no customer anymore, nohow.

1220
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:10,840
Why not?

1221
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:16,980
Every man in your life
is a business relationship.

1222
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:20,320
Your brother's your partner,
your man's your manager,

1223

Billie Holiday.
