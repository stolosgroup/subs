2
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:43,055
You murderers!
It's easy to gun us down! We only got rocks!

3
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:47,055
H A T E

4
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:00,175
This film is dedicated to friends and family

5
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,535
who died while it was in the making.

6
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:08,935
Heard about the guy
who fell off a skyscraper?

7
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:12,020
On his way down past each floor,

8
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:14,565
he kept saying to reassure himself:

9
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:17,525
"So far so good..."

10
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,195
"so far so good..."

11
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:26,785
How you fall doesn't matter.

12
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:29,996
It's how you land!

13
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:06,587
More rioting in the projects outside the city.

14
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:08,755
Last night a mob of youths

15
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,385
attacked a police station
in the Muguet projects.

16
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:16,554
Pitched battles left 14 officers injured.

17
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:18,515
33 arrests were made.

18
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:22,353
A mall and nearby buildings
were damaged by looters

19
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:24,896
who dispersed around 4 a.m.

20
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:28,984
Alleged police brutality
sparked the riots 2 days ago.

21
00:05:29,193 --> 00:05:32,946
A local teen was severely beaten
under questioning.

22
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:34,739
The officer was suspended.

23
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:38,910
The victim, Abdel Ichaha, is in hospital

24
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,870
in critical condition.

25
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,081
Got a looter under arrest, a minor.

26
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:53,485
SAYID: FUCK THE POLICE

27
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,701
Vinz! Where the fuck is he?

28
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:05,204
What?
- Whadda ya mean "what"?

29
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,207
Can't fuckin' say hello?

30
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:09,292
Chill, Sayid. What's up?

31
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,377
Tell your bro to come out.

32
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:13,713
What for?
- Tell him!

33
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,257
What for?
- Just tell him!

34
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:17,842
What for?

35
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,094
Is this a TV game show?

36
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:22,806
Quit hollering!

37
00:07:23,014 --> 00:07:26,600
You guys made enough noise last night!

38
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,896
You see me last night? I wasn't here.

39
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,147
Shut up!

40
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,982
Don't play dumb!

41
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:35,442
You'll burn next, asshole!
- Idiot!

42
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:39,322
You gonna get him?
- Don't asshole me, asshole!

43
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:41,782
You still there? Beat it!

44
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,327
If I wake him, he'll get mad. You try!

45
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:47,955
I hope the cops tan your hide!

46
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:05,180
Vinz...

47
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,309
Shut up, Sayid.

48
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:12,605
Shut up?
Be nice or you're history, fuckface!

49
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:15,149
Go away. You stink!

50
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,319
You want to play this early? One...

51
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:19,278
Two...

52
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:20,612
Three.

53
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:22,614
You lose.

54
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,325
Fuck your sister.

55
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:27,244
I told you not to talk about her!

56
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:29,539
She sucks Donald Duck. Get lost!

57
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:30,414
Jew boy!

58
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:34,001
You bogus kike, you're nowhere!

59
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:36,420
I saw a cow.
- What?

60
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:37,504
A cow.

61
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:38,756
Got some smoke?

62
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,383
In the box.

63
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:47,848
Last night, during the riot,
I dashed behind a building:

64
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:50,642
Wham! I ran right into a cow.

65
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:51,893
Really?

66
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,479
Stop smoking, your brain's fried!

67
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:57,066
Off my bed! I'll say you're taking drugs!

68
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,735
I'll cut your throat, hang you up,

69
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:02,613
you'll drown in your blood!

70
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,739
Granma!

71
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:07,326
Get off the bed.

72
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,119
You get out.

73
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:10,453
Stay off my bed!

74
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,083
Get lost, you snitch!

75
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,168
Move it.

76
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:18,545
Watch your mouth with my sister!
You'll skip temple!

77
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:21,089
Got any salt?
- Respect your granma!

78
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:22,424
You my father?

79
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,842
What about Dad?

80
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,678
You my mother now?

81
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:28,764
Go to school!

82
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:30,766
It burned down.

83
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,851
Burned down! Savages!

84
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:36,521
Start that way and soon you'll skip temple!

85
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:38,607
Granma!
- What?

86
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:39,941
I didn't burn the school!

87
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,986
And you don't go to temple!

88
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:45,280
You win! I surrender!

89
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:47,949
If everyone ran from an argument,

90
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:50,202
there'd be a stampede, already!

91
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:53,121
But we'd all be going the same way!

92
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:54,539
Mazeltov!

93
00:09:54,873 --> 00:09:56,583
You talkin' to me?

94
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:18,521
You talkin' to me, mothafucka!

95
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,743
...the guy says:
"For cash, I'd even murder!"

96
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,289
He tells his friend:
"I'd even waste you."

97
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:38,583
The friend freaks, so the guy says:

98
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,294
"Don't worry, you're a buddy.

99
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:45,173
"I won't waste you for cash,
I'll do it for free!"

100
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,717
What a killer line! "For free!"

101
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:51,512
"I'll waste you for free!"
What a line, Vinz!

102
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,764
I got it the first time.

103
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:55,767
Tell your brother to come see me!

104
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:59,771
What a killer put-down!
"I'll waste you for free!"

105
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,107
Shut up and gimme the joint.

106
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:07,987
A killer line!
- Killer.

107
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:13,284
"I'd waste you for free."
Can't do better than that!

108
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,913
Why you so uptight?

109
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:24,838
Mothafucka!

110
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:30,427
Bastards wrecked everything!

111
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,431
Check that!

112
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:42,897
I don't believe it!

113
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,817
How'd they get the car in?

114
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:50,238
The doorway's too narrow.

115
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,657
Chill, Sayid! There he is.

116
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:56,410
He must be pissed off.

117
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:59,747
Took him two years to get this gym!

118
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,516
Your dope's good, Vinz.

119
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,894
Not mine. It's Hubert's.

120
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:29,109
Don't bogart, Sayid.

121
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:30,945
Thought you quit smoking?

122
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:32,530
Me too.

123
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,700
What happened here?

124
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:38,202
Guess.

125
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:39,911
A fire?

126
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:43,582
You win the prize, Einstein!

127
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,250
Kiss mine, cousin!

128
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:47,878
I knew it'd go up in smoke one day.

129
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,422
So why'd you bust ass to get it?

130
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:52,716
'Cause he wanted to, dickface!

131
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:54,134
You're the dick.

132
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:56,012
You know who did it?

133
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,971
I don't want to know.

134
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:01,892
How'd the car get in here?

135
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:04,728
The doorway's not big enough.

136
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:15,280
We dissed them, spit on them!

137
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:18,159
But the cops didn't move an inch.

138
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:22,454
Then the mothers stepped aside
to make a path...

139
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:33,382
Then these plainclothes pigs
came out with wooden clubs.

140
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:36,551
They hit a homeboy, like real bad!

141
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:39,513
Kept clubbing him till we tore into 'em.

142
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,100
I kicked a pig right in the head!

143
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:55,278
That's a Yamaha.

144
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:58,072
More like your Mom on a Harley!

145
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,992
It's Mohammed's bike. He fixed the exhaust.

146
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,704
No, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!

147
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:05,330
Which Mohammed?

148
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,166
Farida's brother?

149
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,418
Farida with the driver's licence?

150
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,796
No, Farida from the supermarket.

151
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:16,549
Anyway, it was a scene.

152
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:20,846
You should've been there Hubert.
It was intense.

153
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,640
Tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop,

154
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,601
all the fists you can eat,

155
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:28,519
getting hell at home:

156
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:32,273
"Sorry cousin, but I ain't buyin'!"

157
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:38,154
Gimme a break!
It was war against the pigs, in living color!

158
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:41,574
I was trying to make some cash.

159
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:44,411
Your bogus riot fucked it up!

160
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:48,248
When a brother goes down, I stand up!

161
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:51,792
What brother? Do I know the guy?

162
00:14:52,002 --> 00:14:56,840
I won't take hits for a homeboy gangsta
I don't know.

163
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,218
Let's go.

164
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,596
I mean it!

165
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,473
Abdel's no gangsta.

166
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,477
OK, but I'm not faster
than a speeding bullet!

167
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:18,152
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!

168
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:19,361
Gimme one.

169
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:20,822
And go broke?

170
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:22,448
Don't make us cry!

171
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:25,326
I'll make you cry, Sayid!

172
00:15:25,618 --> 00:15:27,578
Everyone pays the same!

173
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:30,039
Except Hubert, it's his building.

174
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:31,206
A buck?

175
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:33,417
A buck for one, OK two!

176
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:36,545
You're a drag!

177
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:38,089
You should try one.

178
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:40,466
Got a buck?
- Yeah, for me!

179
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:41,342
Here.

180
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,762
No way, I'll remember this!

181
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:46,680
So remember.
- Never forget.

182
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,977
Don't be a jerk. I'll pay later.

183
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:55,231
How? With your sister?

184
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:57,733
Don't talk that way about her!

185
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,068
Chill out, you bogus Arab!

186
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:03,322
Sayid! Come back with that!

187
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:11,789
Got any change?

188
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:14,250
We're broke!

189
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,752
2 bits.
- We're broke.

190
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:20,089
...The judge says I go to jail,

191
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:22,049
or do jobs for the City.

192
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,509
Community service? The pits!

193
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,680
Ever do it? Jail's bad enough!

194
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:29,682
You'd rather do time?

195
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:31,558
Your bro stole a dog!

196
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:34,019
Liar!
- His mouth is full!

197
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:35,646
Put it on my tab.

198
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,689
Liar! Your nose is growing!

199
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:40,358
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!

200
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:43,404
Beat it!

201
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:57,000
A.45!

202
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,920
Like the gun in "Lethal Weapon."

203
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:04,132
We saw that movie together!
It was a 9mm. Glock!

204
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:06,634
What?
- No, it wasn't!

205
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:08,929
That was a Desert Eagle.

206
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:12,975
He shot at the truck!

207
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:15,394
That wasn't "Lethal Weapon"!

208
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:18,814
What are you talking about?

209
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:24,152
A cop lost his handgun during the riot.

210
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,946
That's a good one!

211
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:30,659
I don't know the pig who lost his piece.

212
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:33,954
But I'd like to know who found it!

213
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:35,747
No joke!

214
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:43,046
...I'll sleep, eat, lift weights.

215
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:45,757
Everyone's been inside, except me.

216
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:49,177
A month for theft is pathetic!

217
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:50,846
Not in your league!

218
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:55,057
What league? I was never inside!
- You got nabbed.

219
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:57,226
I quit in time!

220
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,354
Come look!

221
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:01,356
We got visitors.

222
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:03,650
Over here!

223
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:06,152
It's the mayor!

224
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:10,573
Up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor! Mothafucka!

225
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,411
Cut the stereo!

226
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:19,416
Who's in charge here? You, Nordeen?

227
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:22,460
What's going on here?

228
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:24,879
Think you're in Disneyland?

229
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:28,300
You're not allowed up here.
You gotta go down.

230
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,718
We're causing no trouble.

231
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:33,929
Still, you've got to get off the roof.

232
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:35,723
We like it up here.

233
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:37,142
Off the roof.

234
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:41,396
You learn that shit at Notre Dame?

235
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,526
Cut it out! Quiet everyone!

236
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:53,157
I'll handle this!
- Forget it!

237
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,284
You can't stay here!

238
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:59,330
So fold your little tents,
grab your chairs...

239
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:02,291
and let's all go downstairs nice and easy.

240
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:03,292
OK!

241
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,587
Who's gonna make us leave?

242
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:08,923
Your goons or you, in your little uniform?

243
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,383
Nordeen, we're doing our job.

244
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:16,347
Leave us alone!

245
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:21,894
Don't talk to me like that,
I don't know you.

246
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,061
Now get lost!

247
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,563
Sitting duck!

248
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,858
Your mother drinks Bud!

249
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:37,368
Anyone who wants to stay, stay! Heat's off.

250
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:40,371
I'm staying.
- You're going.

251
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:42,498
Let me stay, Nordeen.

252
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:44,792
What did I say?
- You said go.

253
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,961
So what do you do?
- I go!

254
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:50,339
OK, I'm going!

255
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,466
Vinz, c'mon!

256
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:55,803
Don't play tough guy!

257
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,305
You always wimp out!

258
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:18,909
...You see 'em in porn stores.

259
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:20,494
What are they called?

260
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:21,828
G-strings.

261
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:23,706
What?
- G-strings, moron.

262
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:26,417
She had one on, I swear it.

263
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,335
I fucked her like an animal.

264
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:30,587
We were in the room...

265
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:35,258
she kept screaming for more.

266
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:39,012
Guy next door pounded
the wall we were so noisy.

267
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,516
You dreamt you fucked her!

268
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:44,810
What?

269
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,772
You know the bitch?
- I know her, she has AIDS.

270
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:50,607
Get outta here!

271
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,151
Hi, we're from TV.
- What's this?

272
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,404
Were you in the riot last night?

273
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,155
Did you break things, burn cars?

274
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,909
We look like looters, lady?
- I didn't say that.

275
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:03,286
So what do we look like?
- Nothing special.

276
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:06,206
Get out the car! This ain't Thoiry.

277
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,083
We got work to do.

278
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,795
What kind of work?
Stirring up shit?

279
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:14,131
For a juicy scoop!
- No camera!

280
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,510
Quit snooping in the 'hood,
fuckface! Stop taping!

281
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,055
Quit taping, dickhead!

282
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:23,473
This ain't Thoiry!

283
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,145
What's with all the assholes today?

284
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:31,106
That fuckin' broad...

285
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,860
What's Thoiry?

286
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,363
A drive-in safari park.

287
00:21:39,782 --> 00:21:41,450
This ain't no zoo!

288
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,869
Open up, WalMart!

289
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,039
You fuckin' jerks.

290
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,417
Talk nice, we're in France.

291
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:55,129
It's 1 p.m.
And you're in bed?

292
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,260
What's with the hair net?

293
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,346
Lay off!

294
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,348
You a movie star, WalMart?

295
00:22:06,016 --> 00:22:07,183
What's this shitty TV?

296
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:09,102
Watch where you sit!

297
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:10,603
Just sweat pants!

298
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:13,482
Where's the new TV?

299
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:14,816
It's too big to move.

300
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:18,194
I came by for my cash. Where were you?

301
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:21,406
I don't have it.

302
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,783
Don't you know what happened?

303
00:22:24,618 --> 00:22:28,371
Go see what your pals did.

304
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:38,297
Foued's brother did that.

305
00:22:38,715 --> 00:22:39,382
So what?

306
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:41,592
Give me his address.

307
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,138
Look what he did to my car!

308
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,140
Look what he did!

309
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:49,600
Just look!

310
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,769
Leave that alone.

311
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:56,191
I lost ten grand! I can't work now.

312
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:59,319
WalMart, it's just a car!

313
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,655
That's what you say!

314
00:23:02,822 --> 00:23:04,657
You don't realize.

315
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:06,951
It's all I got.

316
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:09,078
Cut it out!

317
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:10,329
Leave that alone!

318
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:12,289
A homeboy's dying, fuck your car!

319
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,002
"A homeboy!" Big deal!

320
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,920
You disgust me!

321
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:21,298
That car's all I have. It's my life!

322
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:25,636
They're showing the riot!
- My car's more important!

323
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,054
Look, the riot.

324
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:28,973
Some TV!
- Sure, bust it!

325
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,434
Fix the antenna!
- I'm trying!

326
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,394
It's David!

327
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:35,354
How'd he get on TV?

328
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:38,273
I was over there, they missed me!

329
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:42,278
Fix it! I can't see a thing!
- This TV sucks!

330
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:45,823
How'd that fucker get on TV?

331
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:49,117
Hey, gimme my money!

332
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:51,286
I don't have it. Snoopy has it.

333
00:23:51,454 --> 00:23:54,582
Gimme my coat and get outta my face!

334
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:56,792
You guys must be happy.

335
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,503
A cop lost his gun in the riot.

336
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:04,091
I hope the guy who finds it

337
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:06,635
uses it uptown, not here for once!

338
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:07,511
Forget it,

339
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:09,304
we'll get even!

340
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,854
You know that show, "Candid Camera"?

341
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:20,941
So this celebrity's sure he's been set up.

342
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,570
His buddy's fixed it with the camera guys.

343
00:24:25,738 --> 00:24:28,115
The celebrity thinks they're out to get him.

344
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:30,951
He always eats in the same joint.

345
00:24:31,118 --> 00:24:34,204
He's sure they'll film him there.

346
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:38,042
The others convince him
there's a hidden camera.

347
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:41,837
He sees the TV truck,
a camera behind the mirror

348
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:45,424
and the guy with him pretends to act weird.

349
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:49,094
The celebrity thinks he'll fool 'em,

350
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:53,306
pretending he hasn't noticed.

351
00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:56,935
He thinks all hell will break loose.

352
00:24:57,102 --> 00:25:01,815
But they just film him, jumpy,
waiting for shit to happen.

353
00:25:01,982 --> 00:25:03,316
So you see this guy...

354
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:05,611
Cut it out, Sayid!

355
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:08,196
Wasn't me!
- Then who?

356
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:12,742
The celebrity's sweating,
trying to act cool.

357
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,662
Each time the waiter passes

358
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:17,705
he thinks it'll happen.

359
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:21,710
Then a guy asks him for his autograph.

360
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:23,962
The celeb thinks it's a trick

361
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:26,589
and Starts ranting at the guy,

362
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:31,344
who doesn't know what's up, so he gets mad.

363
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:34,431
They Start fighting,

364
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:37,142
and the Candid Camera guys
have to break it up.

365
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:40,145
It was a killer punch out.

366
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:42,897
Then what?

367
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:45,776
That's all.

368
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:00,832
Who was the celebrity?

369
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:03,251
Dunno, but he was real famous.

370
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,003
I don't remember.

371
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:23,521
This looks like trouble. See ya.

372
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:40,955
WE'RE THE FUTURE

373
00:26:54,761 --> 00:26:56,304
What did they want?

374
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:59,599
"Don't get mad, get even."

375
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:03,728
It's Abdel's brother. He's got a pump gun.

376
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:06,314
Party time!

377
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,779
We go visit Abdel in the hospital?

378
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:20,119
I gotta show you something...

379
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:31,255
That's real steel!

380
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:34,133
Get a load of it.
- What a mother!

381
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,977
What'll you do with it?

382
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:46,186
Stop it, Hubert.

383
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:47,396
What you gonna do with it?

384
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:49,439
Depends if Abdel dies.

385
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:51,608
You gonna kill a cop?

386
00:27:51,776 --> 00:27:53,402
Best way to get respect!

387
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:56,196
Smoking a cop will get you respect?

388
00:27:56,364 --> 00:27:58,407
It'll even up the score.

389
00:27:58,574 --> 00:28:01,743
I coulda got you a piece.
- This one's special.

390
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:03,579
Think you're on a mission?

391
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:07,499
Well, I did find the gun. Leave me alone!

392
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:10,919
Will it help Abdel?
- It'll help us.

393
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:14,715
Stop fronting!

394
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:16,341
You pussy!

395
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,051
You're headed for big shit!

396
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:19,970
I'll do my thing, you do yours.

397
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:23,640
I don't want to know.
- So don't ask!

398
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:29,438
One thing's sure...

399
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,899
With that piece you're the big man.

400
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:41,909
Hey, wait for me!

401
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:53,796
Fuck it...

402
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:02,471
What the fuck ya doin'?

403
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:05,599
OK, don't have a shit fit!

404
00:29:39,508 --> 00:29:41,218
Sorry, fellas, you can't go in.

405
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:43,095
Let us in. We came to see Abdel.

406
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:45,180
Sorry, I have my orders.

407
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:48,892
Just a couple of minutes. Then we'll leave.

408
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,518
He's our friend.

409
00:29:51,395 --> 00:29:54,564
The docs won't let you in. He's in a coma.

410
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:56,357
We won't make trouble!

411
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,985
If I let you in,

412
00:29:59,152 --> 00:30:01,320
I'll lose my job.
- Sure, flunkey!

413
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:04,365
Tone it down. His family's here.

414
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:06,660
They need peace and quiet!

415
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:10,205
We're not as good as reporters?

416
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:11,623
Get going!

417
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,916
Hands off, man!

418
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:16,878
You gonna make me leave?

419
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:19,172
Gonna shoot me? Pull out your pop gun!

420
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:22,341
What's going on here?

421
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:24,052
Look at that fuckface!

422
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:27,638
We came to see our pal Abdel!

423
00:30:29,015 --> 00:30:31,016
We won't leave till we see him.

424
00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:33,185
Beat it, before I take you in.

425
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:34,437
Oh, yeah?

426
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:35,897
You shut up!

427
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:38,942
Move 'em out!

428
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:46,866
We can be nice or nasty.
It's up to you!

429
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:50,411
Calm down!

430
00:30:50,912 --> 00:30:53,539
Lieut., these kids made trouble.

431
00:30:53,706 --> 00:30:55,791
I got the ringleader.

432
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:58,878
He did nothing.
- I arrested the leader.

433
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:00,921
What leader?
- He means Sayid.

434
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:01,964
Sure, Uncle Tom!

435
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,643
Things aren't bad enough.

436
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,020
You had to go to the hospital?

437
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:17,772
They were only doing their job.

438
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:19,607
Doing their job?

439
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:22,443
Shut your yap, once and for all!

440
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,903
You shut yours!
- Don't talk to me like that!

441
00:31:25,113 --> 00:31:27,824
Same to you!
- Shut up, will ya!

442
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:29,158
Shit!

443
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:30,951
You don't know a fucking thing!

444
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,203
What do you know?

445
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,205
Cut it out, asshole.

446
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:36,499
Watch your tongue!
- If you watch yours!

447
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:40,461
The bastards who beat up Abdel
will go to jail!

448
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:42,588
You're dreaming.

449
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,632
The cops at the hospital

450
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,800
protect Abdel and his family.

451
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:50,262
You just fuck things up!

452
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:53,891
You idiot, you got it all wrong.

453
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:57,644
Those cops are just protecting Abdel!

454
00:31:58,354 --> 00:32:02,024
Most cops don't beat on you.
They protect you!

455
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:05,695
Who protects us from you?

456
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:25,565
Never do it again!

457
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:27,316
Who writes your jokes?

458
00:33:27,484 --> 00:33:29,527
Watch your tongue!

459
00:33:29,695 --> 00:33:31,530
Watch your mother!

460
00:33:34,408 --> 00:33:36,326
You ever trash me again,

461
00:33:36,493 --> 00:33:38,536
you go to central lock-up.

462
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:41,498
Your brother can bail you out.

463
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:44,292
I didn't ask no favors.
- I did it for your brother.

464
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:46,794
He'd rip you apart!

465
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:49,881
You're the ripper.

466
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:59,265
About the boxing gym:
I can get you a City grant.

467
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:01,810
You'll get another gym.

468
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:06,397
Kids want to punch more than bags now!

469
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:10,610
It's hopeless.
Once I could talk to the kids. No more.

470
00:34:10,777 --> 00:34:15,740
And they know me!
A rookie cop wouldn't last a month.

471
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:18,534
An Arab in a police station
doesn't last an hour!

472
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:23,247
I have to go.
Try to keep cool.

473
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:26,042
Yeah, we'll try.

474
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:28,836
Outta my face, you fucker!

475
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,505
OK!

476
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:33,966
You shook his hand?

477
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:36,344
He's always been cool with me.

478
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:38,638
You don't shake a pig's hand!

479
00:34:38,805 --> 00:34:43,559
You shoot him, I shake his hand!
You're a fuckin'pain!

480
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:45,812
And you're out of it!
Look!

481
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:48,189
I knew it!

482
00:34:48,356 --> 00:34:50,191
You acted so weird at the hospital.

483
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:52,276
Take it easy.
- Let me see.

484
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:55,195
You didn't tell us?

485
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:57,573
You didn't want to know!

486
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,658
Packing that!
You retard!

487
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:02,537
I'm a big boy.
Quit preaching!

488
00:35:02,954 --> 00:35:04,664
I'll bust your chops!

489
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:07,166
Stop it!

490
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:11,003
You feel big with that gun!
I'll kick your ass!

491
00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:12,296
Like how?

492
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:15,299
Cut it out. Let's grab a sandwich.

493
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:17,634
You shut up!

494
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:19,177
I'm splittin'.

495
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:21,096
So split!

496
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,808
Stay with us.

497
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:25,642
Sayid, let him split!

498
00:35:26,978 --> 00:35:29,105
Don't go!

499
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:30,523
Back off.

500
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:36,654
What's with him?

501
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:41,658
Jerk thinks too much.

502
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,843
Where's Mom?
- Explain this to me.

503
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:01,971
I can't now.

504
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:11,229
Well?

505
00:36:12,398 --> 00:36:13,482
What's the answer?

506
00:36:13,691 --> 00:36:14,608
I don't know.

507
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:17,319
You never know.
- OK, I never know.

508
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,113
Hi, Mom.

509
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:20,781
How's the kid brother?

510
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:22,324
He's fine.

511
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:25,953
But your brother in jail isn't so good.

512
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:27,704
What's with Max?

513
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:30,082
He needs textbooks.

514
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:31,708
What for?

515
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:35,713
To get a high school diploma
while he's inside.

516
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,676
He never made grade school!

517
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,179
Hands off the pots!

518
00:36:45,055 --> 00:36:46,306
I didn't do nothing!

519
00:36:46,557 --> 00:36:49,017
I dunno how I'll buy his books.

520
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:50,351
By the way...

521
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:53,813
There's the money
for the power bill.

522
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:01,904
And my machine?
- What machine?

523
00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:05,575
My new sewing machine!

524
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:08,454
Shit, I forgot to ask WalMart.

525
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,331
Mine's ready to croak.

526
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:13,833
Patou, go study in your room.

527
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:16,670
Mom.
- Don't argue.

528
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:20,256
Who's WalMart? That fence in Tower B?

529
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:22,509
No, he's in Tower D.

530
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:24,302
I don't know him.

531
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:26,471
Could he get us textbooks?

532
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,389
That's not his line, Mom.

533
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:30,225
Officials now admit

534
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:34,145
that a policeman lost his gun
in the riot last night.

535
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:36,439
It is still missing.

536
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:40,693
We asked locals if a loose gun is dangerous

537
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:43,071
in this explosive situation...

538
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:44,447
What a fuck up!

539
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:46,657
They burned down the gym.

540
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:53,373
I'm sick of the projects.
I want out. It's getting worse.

541
00:37:53,582 --> 00:37:56,668
I'm sure Vinz helped torch the gym.

542
00:37:57,919 --> 00:38:00,296
He's going wild, like Max.

543
00:38:01,882 --> 00:38:03,508
I have to get out.

544
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,177
I have to leave this place.

545
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:09,972
If you see a grocery, buy me a lettuce.

546
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:11,390
No credit for you.

547
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:15,144
My granma's a regular here!
So I'm 2 bits short!

548
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,689
You're not your granma.

549
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:21,150
Hands off!
- Just looking!

550
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:23,653
Got two bits?
- How about one?

551
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,988
One OK?
- One not OK.

552
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:30,159
Gimme a coin, you dinosaur!

553
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:31,910
No coins for you.

554
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:34,121
OK... Now what?

555
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:36,332
So what'll it be?

556
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,293
I saw you!
- You saw what?

557
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:42,172
Gimme the red peppers. They're cheaper.

558
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,466
My granma'll kill me! She hates 'em.

559
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:50,262
So shoot the Chink, grab the green peppers!

560
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,390
It'll make granma's day!

561
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:25,667
Fuck, fuck the po-lice...

562
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:16,092
He's intense.

563
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,927
Killer!

564
00:42:19,054 --> 00:42:20,680
A mother killer!

565
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,565
Sayid, check out the cow.

566
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:33,860
Fuck off with your cow!

567
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,862
I swear!
- You said you'd cut my hair.

568
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,073
The same cow! I saw it!

569
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,574
You're the cow!

570
00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:43,286
It was the same fuckin' cow!

571
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:45,163
You gotta believe me!

572
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,497
Shut up!

573
00:42:50,627 --> 00:42:53,921
I'm Segnor Duck...

574
00:42:58,051 --> 00:43:01,137
I fucka you, I fucka her, I fucka him...

575
00:43:01,304 --> 00:43:04,724
OK Granma! So they're red peppers!

576
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,227
You know this cow business.

577
00:43:08,436 --> 00:43:10,187
It's a weird trip.

578
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,941
Don't wreck my hair!

579
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:16,735
I gotta get laid! So watch it!

580
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:18,821
I can mow a lawn, I'll try.

581
00:43:18,988 --> 00:43:19,655
A lawn?

582
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:21,865
Sit your ass down.

583
00:43:22,825 --> 00:43:24,701
It's hot, Vinz.
- What?

584
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,704
A cop's piece is hot.

585
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:30,374
You said that already. Sit still, loser!

586
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:32,585
I'll whack you.

587
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,587
Don't move.

588
00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:36,922
If Abdel dies, you'll kill?

589
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:40,050
Wanna be the next Arab iced by the pigs?

590
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:40,509
Well, me neither.

591
00:43:40,635 --> 00:43:42,636
Well, me neither.

592
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:44,804
So now you're an Arab!

593
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:47,099
They think we're full of shit.

594
00:43:47,266 --> 00:43:50,394
But I'm not bullshitting about this, Sayid.

595
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:53,522
Watch it!

596
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,190
It's cool.

597
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:58,444
Is this gun legit for a cop? What'd you do?

598
00:43:58,611 --> 00:44:00,487
Nothing, I swear it!

599
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:03,031
Why swear?

600
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,450
Because it's nothing.

601
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:05,868
I'm cold there!

602
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,536
It's cold in this room!

603
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:14,042
I'll even it out, it'll be great!

604
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,670
I got a date! Lemme see!

605
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:18,630
No fuckin' trust!

606
00:44:19,465 --> 00:44:20,465
I didn't see!

607
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:21,925
You didn't look!

608
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:24,886
Trust me, dammit!

609
00:44:25,804 --> 00:44:27,305
It's a nice hole.

610
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:28,891
A nice what?

611
00:44:29,058 --> 00:44:32,060
Trust me, or no haircut!

612
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:36,773
Look at me, Sayid!

613
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,608
Get outta here!

614
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,486
Don't get bummed out!

615
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:44,198
It's the style in New York.

616
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:47,283
The killer cut, so stop whining!

617
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,368
New York?

618
00:44:48,535 --> 00:44:52,205
They got hair like this in New York?
I look punk!

619
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:53,206
Honest!

620
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,457
Don't laugh!

621
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,085
Give us a kiss, Sayid.

622
00:44:57,252 --> 00:44:58,920
Outta my face!

623
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:01,964
No hard feelings, sucker!

624
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:07,637
Hey pooch, your master's an asshole!

625
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,521
There's your sister.

626
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,988
Why're you here?
- And you?

627
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,282
I'm asking the questions!

628
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,868
You should be in school.

629
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:32,454
Get outta here!

630
00:45:33,872 --> 00:45:36,082
Get lost, you cows.

631
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:38,752
You still here?

632
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:42,755
Get lost!

633
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:44,841
You talk to my friends!

634
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,551
To Vincent.

635
00:45:46,718 --> 00:45:50,555
The name's Vinz, not Vincent!
And don't talk to him!

636
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:53,766
Get a move on!
- Don't push!

637
00:45:57,979 --> 00:46:00,189
Coming tonight?
- Where?

638
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:03,318
Jason's brother's in a prize fight.

639
00:46:03,485 --> 00:46:05,778
Got tickets?
- Freebies.

640
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:07,364
Killer!

641
00:46:09,157 --> 00:46:10,867
Who cut your hair, Sayid?

642
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:14,286
Kids these days!

643
00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:15,621
Check that!

644
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,438
Shit's happenin'!

645
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:36,201
Abdel's my brother, pig!

646
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:40,247
You're gonna pay!

647
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:42,958
Step on it!

648
00:47:43,584 --> 00:47:44,751
It's stalled!

649
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:46,920
Outta the car, freeze!

650
00:47:57,807 --> 00:48:00,142
Drop the gun!

651
00:48:04,522 --> 00:48:06,065
Freeze!

652
00:48:27,294 --> 00:48:28,294
Get back!

653
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,798
Get the fuck out!

654
00:48:30,964 --> 00:48:33,174
Riot cops are coming!

655
00:48:33,425 --> 00:48:35,426
Get back, scum!

656
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,606
Vinz, Hubert, this way!

657
00:48:52,444 --> 00:48:53,820
This way!

658
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:57,365
Freeze!

659
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:02,745
You crazy?

660
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,458
Where were you?

661
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:10,128
We fucked your mother!

662
00:49:15,884 --> 00:49:19,470
I swear the pig was right in my sights.

663
00:49:19,638 --> 00:49:22,640
I had him like I have you now!

664
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:26,728
The sucker froze, shit his pants.

665
00:49:26,895 --> 00:49:29,147
Without Hubert, I'd have smoked him!

666
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:31,232
Right in the mother!

667
00:49:31,399 --> 00:49:34,777
Hubert slugged him so hard
he went into orbit!

668
00:49:34,945 --> 00:49:35,654
No!

669
00:49:35,821 --> 00:49:37,072
I swear it!

670
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:38,615
Slugged a pig?

671
00:49:39,616 --> 00:49:41,576
You were great!

672
00:49:52,379 --> 00:49:55,507
THE WORLD IS YOURS

673
00:50:33,753 --> 00:50:35,671
Now what do we do?

674
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:42,427
I gotta call to get my bucks.

675
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:50,978
Got Snoopy's address?

676
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:54,190
I'll wait, but not forever!

677
00:50:56,567 --> 00:51:00,946
This cost me a $3 chocolate milk!
I'd better collect!

678
00:51:01,447 --> 00:51:04,116
You want some, Vinz?

679
00:51:04,534 --> 00:51:05,534
Want some?
- No.

680
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:06,785
You sure?

681
00:51:08,454 --> 00:51:10,497
Want some, Cousin Hubie?

682
00:51:11,249 --> 00:51:13,167
You're already chocolate!

683
00:51:18,798 --> 00:51:21,425
Will you guys stop sulking?

684
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,096
Who's sulking? Not me!

685
00:51:26,264 --> 00:51:27,974
Unbelievable!
- Ask him!

686
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,724
A couple of kids!

687
00:51:29,892 --> 00:51:33,895
Who's the kid?
- 2 kids worrying over jackshit!

688
00:51:34,063 --> 00:51:36,523
I'm 100% behind you!

689
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:39,651
Wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!

690
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,949
Tell your buddy to back off!
I never said I wanted to.

691
00:51:45,282 --> 00:51:45,991
Yes, you did!

692
00:51:46,158 --> 00:51:46,950
Yes!
- No!

693
00:51:47,118 --> 00:51:48,953
I didn't say that!

694
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,163
I said if Abdel died,

695
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,082
I'd smoke a cop. Not for the hell of it!

696
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,501
Without my gun back there,

697
00:51:56,669 --> 00:51:58,504
we'd have been history!

698
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:00,881
My name's not Rodney King!

699
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:02,799
Not the same thing!

700
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:06,303
Expect us to bring you gifts in jail?

701
00:52:07,012 --> 00:52:11,099
I expect nothing!
Not from a guy who kisses cop ass!

702
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:14,269
Go ahead, laugh!

703
00:52:14,436 --> 00:52:16,271
Laugh!

704
00:52:16,438 --> 00:52:19,566
I'm fuckin' sick of the goddam system!

705
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:23,570
We live in rat holes,
you do fuck-all to change things!

706
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:25,864
Neither do you!

707
00:52:26,073 --> 00:52:28,450
You're my homeys, so I'll tell you:

708
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:30,577
If Abdel dies, I hit back.

709
00:52:30,744 --> 00:52:32,620
I'll whack a pig!

710
00:52:34,915 --> 00:52:38,209
So they know we don't turn
the other cheek now!

711
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:40,503
Wow, what a speech!

712
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:43,507
Half Moses, half Mickey Mouse.

713
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:47,260
Forget it, Vinz. You're out of your league.

714
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:50,138
If Abdel dies, we lose a friend?

715
00:52:50,305 --> 00:52:51,055
Right!

716
00:52:51,223 --> 00:52:53,892
If a cop dies, do all cops go away?

717
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:57,979
You're just one guy!
You can't blow 'em all away!

718
00:52:58,188 --> 00:53:00,273
Who made you a preacher?

719
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,109
You know what's right and wrong?

720
00:53:03,276 --> 00:53:06,153
Why do you side with the assholes?

721
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:08,448
Who's the asshole?

722
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:13,119
In school we learnt that hate breeds hate!

723
00:53:13,286 --> 00:53:16,414
I didn't go to school, I'm from the street!

724
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:18,207
Know what it taught me?

725
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:22,045
Turn the other cheek,
you're dead mothafucka!

726
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:27,801
Bullshit! You pointed a gun at a cop!
We coulda been killed!

727
00:53:27,968 --> 00:53:29,969
Nothing like a good shit!

728
00:53:31,137 --> 00:53:35,307
You believe in God?
That's the wrong question.

729
00:53:35,475 --> 00:53:37,768
Does God believe in us?

730
00:53:37,978 --> 00:53:41,564
I once had a friend called Grunwalski.

731
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:44,984
We were sent to Siberia together.

732
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,863
When you go to a Siberian work camp,

733
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,907
you travel in a cattle car.

734
00:53:52,075 --> 00:53:56,162
You roll across icy steppes for days,

735
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:58,622
without seeing a soul.

736
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,167
You huddle to keep warm.

737
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:06,130
But it's hard to relieve yourself,
to take a shit,

738
00:54:06,297 --> 00:54:08,674
you can't do it on the train,

739
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:11,802
and the only time the train stops

740
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:15,640
is to take on water for the locomotive.

741
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,851
But Grunwalski was shy.

742
00:54:19,018 --> 00:54:21,311
Even when we bathed together,

743
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,147
he got upset.

744
00:54:23,314 --> 00:54:26,775
I used to kid him about it.

745
00:54:27,193 --> 00:54:32,031
So, the train stops
and everyone jumps out to shit

746
00:54:32,198 --> 00:54:34,116
on the tracks.

747
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:37,662
I'd teased Grunwalski so much

748
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:41,040
that he went off on his own.

749
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,084
The train Starts moving,

750
00:54:44,252 --> 00:54:46,462
so everyone jumps on,

751
00:54:46,713 --> 00:54:49,340
because it waits for nobody.

752
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:52,134
Grunwalski had a problem:

753
00:54:52,343 --> 00:54:55,387
He'd gone behind a bush

754
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:57,515
and was still shitting.

755
00:54:57,974 --> 00:55:02,186
So I see him come out from behind the bush,

756
00:55:02,353 --> 00:55:06,982
holding up his pants with his hands.

757
00:55:07,191 --> 00:55:09,818
He tries to catch up.

758
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,195
I hold out my hand,

759
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:15,199
but each time he reaches for it

760
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:17,117
he lets go of his pants

761
00:55:17,285 --> 00:55:19,578
and they drop to his ankles.

762
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:21,705
He pulls them back up,

763
00:55:21,872 --> 00:55:23,623
Starts running again,

764
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:27,252
but they fall back down,

765
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,880
when he reaches out for me.

766
00:55:31,424 --> 00:55:33,592
Then what happened?
- Nothing.

767
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:35,469
Grunwalski...

768
00:55:36,637 --> 00:55:38,472
froze to death.

769
00:55:40,558 --> 00:55:41,475
Good day.

770
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,191
Why'd he tell us that?

771
00:55:58,576 --> 00:56:00,953
I got the address. I'll call you.

772
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:06,332
Why'd he tell us that?

773
00:56:22,391 --> 00:56:24,684
'Xcuse me, I'm just out of the hospital.

774
00:56:24,852 --> 00:56:26,937
I haven't eaten for 2 days.

775
00:56:27,104 --> 00:56:30,941
My child's hungry,
I need your spare change...

776
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:35,779
I wanna date with Mina!

777
00:56:35,946 --> 00:56:37,864
I'll lasso her!

778
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:41,618
What d'you want? My dad's in jail,

779
00:56:41,785 --> 00:56:44,329
my mom's in jail, my whole family is!

780
00:56:44,496 --> 00:56:46,581
Get a job like everyone else!

781
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:49,417
What is this, Mardi Gras?

782
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:54,256
I want Mina!

783
00:56:56,633 --> 00:57:01,179
I'm homeless, my welfare ran out.

784
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:05,433
I got out of a halfway house...

785
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,060
It's a block away.

786
00:57:08,437 --> 00:57:09,020
Thanks.

787
00:57:09,187 --> 00:57:10,646
Have a nice day, sir.

788
00:57:10,814 --> 00:57:11,898
Thanks.

789
00:57:16,403 --> 00:57:18,863
The pigs are fuckin' polite around here!

790
00:57:20,198 --> 00:57:22,241
Even called me sir!

791
00:57:33,503 --> 00:57:35,963
Maybe he won the lottery!

792
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:43,012
Damn, it's locked!

793
00:57:44,222 --> 00:57:46,390
What's his real name?

794
00:57:46,558 --> 00:57:49,352
I only know him as Snoopy.

795
00:57:56,526 --> 00:57:59,403
Yes?
- Sorry to bother you.

796
00:57:59,571 --> 00:58:01,239
I'm looking for...

797
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:02,656
Snoopy.

798
00:58:03,283 --> 00:58:05,493
It sounds weird.
- Very funny!

799
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,621
The fucker hung up.

800
00:58:10,456 --> 00:58:11,707
You try.

801
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:13,918
Why me?
- Try!

802
00:58:14,502 --> 00:58:16,503
Darkie and me will get shot at!

803
00:58:19,257 --> 00:58:20,758
Hello.
- Yes?

804
00:58:20,925 --> 00:58:22,801
Is Snoopy there?

805
00:58:23,636 --> 00:58:25,721
No, but Charlie Brown is!

806
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:32,561
You fucked it up, you asshole!

807
00:58:32,729 --> 00:58:33,813
Stop that!

808
00:58:34,022 --> 00:58:35,815
Sorry to bother you.

809
00:58:35,982 --> 00:58:40,319
Our pal Snoopy lives here,
we don't know his real name.

810
00:58:40,486 --> 00:58:43,864
Stop ringing! You thinka da world is yours?

811
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:45,949
Unreal!

812
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,580
No, we're staying!

813
00:58:55,251 --> 00:58:57,252
So call the cops, you spic!

814
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,170
Sayid?

815
00:58:59,297 --> 00:59:00,631
Snoopy?

816
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,467
What floor?
- 5th.

817
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:04,802
We're coming!

818
00:59:07,346 --> 00:59:09,181
Snoopy? Is no name!

819
00:59:09,348 --> 00:59:11,183
You always make a trouble!

820
00:59:24,363 --> 00:59:26,406
Were you followed?
- No.

821
00:59:26,574 --> 00:59:28,284
No one?
- Nobody!

822
00:59:28,451 --> 00:59:29,702
You sure?
- Why?

823
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,161
Because...

824
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,623
You cool?

825
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:37,167
Great!

826
00:59:37,334 --> 00:59:38,835
Check that kitchen.

827
00:59:39,295 --> 00:59:40,796
Who's this dude?

828
00:59:42,715 --> 00:59:45,467
Nice space! You win the lottery?

829
00:59:45,634 --> 00:59:49,304
A guy loaned it to me.
He ain't gettin' it back!

830
00:59:49,471 --> 00:59:52,640
This is no apartment, it's a palace!

831
00:59:52,975 --> 00:59:53,975
I don't believe it.

832
00:59:54,184 --> 00:59:56,561
Bitchin' apartment!

833
00:59:56,729 --> 00:59:59,648
Snoopy, meet Vinz.

834
01:00:01,942 --> 01:00:03,777
This is Cousin Hubert!

835
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,738
We've met before!

836
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,240
Line of coke?
- No.

837
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:09,991
You sure?
- No thanks.

838
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:12,911
A little line of coke?

839
01:00:13,078 --> 01:00:15,705
No one for coke?

840
01:00:16,081 --> 01:00:18,124
How's your bro?
- OK.

841
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:20,043
Mean fuckin' dude!

842
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,503
He still a maniac?
- And you?

843
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:24,672
Fuckin' A! Watch!

844
01:00:25,466 --> 01:00:26,884
So you got my cash?

845
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:28,426
My bread!

846
01:00:28,635 --> 01:00:32,013
Make it snappy, Snoopy!

847
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:34,308
Cut the bullshit!

848
01:00:37,644 --> 01:00:38,811
Come get it.

849
01:00:39,563 --> 01:00:41,731
Comin' at you, Bruce Lee!

850
01:00:47,904 --> 01:00:49,780
Hands off!
- What?

851
01:00:49,948 --> 01:00:52,408
Not for kids! It's my gun!

852
01:00:54,369 --> 01:00:57,205
So what? I got a piece too.

853
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:00,250
Let's see!

854
01:01:01,126 --> 01:01:02,502
Whip it out.

855
01:01:06,548 --> 01:01:07,465
Fuck!

856
01:01:07,632 --> 01:01:08,966
Don't, Vinz!

857
01:01:09,176 --> 01:01:10,260
He knows guns.

858
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:13,805
A snub-nosed Smith & Wesson Magnum 44.

859
01:01:14,598 --> 01:01:15,682
Watch it!

860
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:16,975
It's loaded.

861
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:19,226
Mean piece.

862
01:01:20,145 --> 01:01:21,688
You're a gangsta.

863
01:01:22,898 --> 01:01:24,608
It's for self-defense.

864
01:01:24,774 --> 01:01:26,775
You into magic?

865
01:01:26,943 --> 01:01:27,860
Watch.

866
01:01:28,236 --> 01:01:29,403
One bullet.

867
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:34,742
I missed.

868
01:01:35,285 --> 01:01:36,452
You're nuts!

869
01:01:36,661 --> 01:01:39,663
That's live ammo!
- It's an old trick!

870
01:01:40,415 --> 01:01:41,499
Cool it.

871
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:45,086
We up the stakes: 2 bullets!

872
01:01:46,087 --> 01:01:47,254
Snoopy!

873
01:01:47,422 --> 01:01:50,133
Wiggin' out, guys?

874
01:01:50,717 --> 01:01:52,468
You're nuts.

875
01:01:52,635 --> 01:01:53,719
Gimme!

876
01:01:55,638 --> 01:01:56,805
Your turn.

877
01:01:56,973 --> 01:01:58,891
Let's go, he's fried.

878
01:01:59,058 --> 01:01:59,975
Gonna do it?

879
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,770
Gimme.
- Do it!

880
01:02:04,397 --> 01:02:05,898
I did it, you do it!

881
01:02:06,065 --> 01:02:07,941
Man, you want trouble?

882
01:02:08,109 --> 01:02:09,819
Do it!

883
01:02:10,737 --> 01:02:11,988
Chill, guys!

884
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:15,700
Stop, Vinz!

885
01:02:15,867 --> 01:02:17,201
You aiming at me?

886
01:02:17,368 --> 01:02:19,203
You're off your head!

887
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:21,247
You bet I'm aiming at you!

888
01:02:21,414 --> 01:02:23,541
No one fucks with me!

889
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:26,919
I'm not some ass-wipe!

890
01:02:28,254 --> 01:02:29,672
Wanna see a gun?

891
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,465
A fuckin' gun?

892
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:37,262
Sayid, get him out!

893
01:02:39,015 --> 01:02:40,725
We're outta here!

894
01:02:43,853 --> 01:02:46,647
Up your mother's slash, sucker!

895
01:02:47,815 --> 01:02:48,815
Look!

896
01:02:52,987 --> 01:02:56,031
That's right, asshole!

897
01:02:56,532 --> 01:02:57,616
He was bluffing!

898
01:02:57,825 --> 01:03:02,079
Now I'll never get my cash!

899
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:05,374
Leave us out of your games, Vinz!

900
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:10,295
Games? We got a pal in the hospital!

901
01:03:10,463 --> 01:03:12,464
Don't take on the world!

902
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:14,799
You got the wrong build!

903
01:03:14,967 --> 01:03:18,804
I'm not like you, Mr. Black Hercules, right?

904
01:03:19,013 --> 01:03:20,264
Go fuck yourself!

905
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:21,806
Fuck myself?

906
01:03:29,398 --> 01:03:31,149
Alright, kids!

907
01:03:31,317 --> 01:03:32,860
Who're you?
- Easy!

908
01:03:33,027 --> 01:03:35,154
You had your fun!

909
01:03:35,362 --> 01:03:36,821
Easy!

910
01:03:40,034 --> 01:03:41,660
Search them.

911
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:44,621
Fast work! In my 'hood, the cops come

912
01:03:44,788 --> 01:03:46,998
a week after you're dead!

913
01:03:47,249 --> 01:03:48,708
Hey, you!

914
01:03:49,835 --> 01:03:52,796
You together?
- I don't know them.

915
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:54,422
Why you here?

916
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:56,550
I live with my aunt!

917
01:03:56,717 --> 01:03:57,884
What's her name?

918
01:03:58,093 --> 01:03:59,844
Mrs. Zyl...

919
01:04:01,346 --> 01:04:05,475
Got I.D.?
- I'm on the level...

920
01:04:12,941 --> 01:04:14,901
Easy!

921
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:17,069
Freeze!

922
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:18,822
Don't move, boy!

923
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:20,698
You know him?

924
01:04:20,866 --> 01:04:22,325
Who?
- Your pal.

925
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,076
I don't know him.

926
01:04:25,287 --> 01:04:27,831
We'll see about that, wise guy!

927
01:04:28,874 --> 01:04:30,959
This is humiliating!
- Too bad.

928
01:04:32,753 --> 01:04:34,296
What's this?

929
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,214
Good stuff!

930
01:04:36,548 --> 01:04:39,008
I'm keeping it.

931
01:04:40,886 --> 01:04:43,179
Afghan's the best.

932
01:04:43,638 --> 01:04:45,681
Good buzz going up and down.

933
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:48,393
Same with Black Bombay.

934
01:04:48,643 --> 01:04:50,811
Lebanese can really vary.

935
01:04:50,979 --> 01:04:54,899
This is crap but I'll keep it... Well?

936
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,569
The little fucker outran me. Take them in.

937
01:04:58,737 --> 01:05:00,280
Get in the back.
- Why me?

938
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:01,823
Get in!

939
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:17,713
Listen, scumbag.
You know what I think of you?

940
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:19,965
You're like poodle shit on a sidewalk.

941
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:22,426
I can't take a step

942
01:05:22,594 --> 01:05:26,973
without squashing your ugly dog-turd face.

943
01:05:27,515 --> 01:05:30,601
So watch where the dog dumps you!

944
01:06:26,866 --> 01:06:28,200
You're all alone!

945
01:06:28,826 --> 01:06:30,577
Far from the slums...

946
01:06:31,162 --> 01:06:32,580
and your looter pals.

947
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:36,000
Pick it up with your feet.

948
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:38,710
Like your people do back home.

949
01:06:40,004 --> 01:06:42,297
They're great with their feet.

950
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,926
This is the hard part.

951
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:53,308
OK, there's no big hurry.

952
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,686
In 2 hours, they may be free.

953
01:06:55,853 --> 01:06:57,688
Make the most of it.

954
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:03,944
How 'bout a bullet in the back of your head?

955
01:07:04,445 --> 01:07:06,280
A nice little bullet?

956
01:07:06,447 --> 01:07:08,824
You gotta stop in time.

957
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,368
You need self-control.

958
01:07:11,535 --> 01:07:13,161
Gotta be a pro.

959
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,998
This takes control.

960
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,709
Don't get mad! It won't last!

961
01:07:22,922 --> 01:07:25,758
You got something to say?

962
01:07:26,383 --> 01:07:29,594
Don't touch him!

963
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,389
You know this one?

964
01:07:32,598 --> 01:07:34,474
The Shanghai Squeeze.

965
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,726
It's an oldie.

966
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,523
Wait, I think he's thirsty.

967
01:07:43,317 --> 01:07:44,693
Fucker!

968
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,987
Don't hurt yourself!

969
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,489
Take it easy!

970
01:07:50,657 --> 01:07:52,700
Don't get me aroused.

971
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:55,162
You look like a bitch from behind!

972
01:07:55,329 --> 01:07:58,832
A nice bitch to suck me off!

973
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:02,043
Blow jobs!

974
01:08:02,336 --> 01:08:04,171
Bitches to suck my dick!

975
01:08:04,755 --> 01:08:07,591
That's the way. Then you relax!

976
01:08:07,925 --> 01:08:10,594
But it's hard to stop in time.

977
01:08:10,761 --> 01:08:12,929
You gotta stay in control.

978
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,226
That's the trick.

979
01:08:18,435 --> 01:08:19,894
I like his face.

980
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,062
He's cute.

981
01:08:21,647 --> 01:08:23,523
What was the name?

982
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:28,861
Are you cute?
- Yes! I'm cute!

983
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,948
I'm cute!

984
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,577
Which one?
- He's Hubert.

985
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:37,203
That's no Hubert!

986
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:39,247
He's French, he's Sayid.

987
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:41,290
Sayid? That's pretty!

988
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:44,544
Is Sayid a French name?

989
01:08:44,711 --> 01:08:47,088
Aren't they pretty?

990
01:08:47,881 --> 01:08:50,341
Take a good look!

991
01:08:52,427 --> 01:08:54,512
The little guy's excited.

992
01:08:54,679 --> 01:08:57,723
Leave him alone!

993
01:09:05,398 --> 01:09:07,483
It's so easy to go too far!

994
01:09:07,651 --> 01:09:10,737
But you mustn't! Though you're dying to!

995
01:09:11,446 --> 01:09:14,240
Right, you Arab sonofabitch?

996
01:09:17,077 --> 01:09:18,745
OK, let's go.

997
01:09:40,892 --> 01:09:42,685
Sir!

998
01:09:42,852 --> 01:09:44,728
We'll miss the last train!

999
01:09:44,896 --> 01:09:46,147
Forget it.

1000
01:09:46,356 --> 01:09:47,440
Bastard!

1001
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:50,360
Did I talk to you?

1002
01:10:22,058 --> 01:10:23,642
Yo, Vinz!

1003
01:10:25,186 --> 01:10:26,854
Where's Sayid and Hubert?

1004
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:29,398
Dunno. They pissed me off tonight.

1005
01:10:29,607 --> 01:10:32,067
You guys are always fussin'!

1006
01:11:02,515 --> 01:11:03,933
Your sister's hot.

1007
01:11:04,642 --> 01:11:06,935
Shut up, asshole.

1008
01:11:07,478 --> 01:11:09,229
Sorry, but she's hot.

1009
01:11:09,396 --> 01:11:11,272
You don't stand a chance.

1010
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,483
Don't you try.

1011
01:11:14,777 --> 01:11:17,029
Don't even look at her!

1012
01:11:17,196 --> 01:11:18,822
Check the turn!

1013
01:11:18,989 --> 01:11:21,783
I won't try 'cause she's pregnant.

1014
01:11:21,951 --> 01:11:25,954
Don't diss my sis', butthead!

1015
01:11:37,758 --> 01:11:39,759
Brothers, I gotta make it

1016
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:42,220
by any means necessary

1017
01:11:42,429 --> 01:11:44,806
'cos my mind's playin' tricks on me.

1018
01:11:50,437 --> 01:11:51,980
You won't let us in?

1019
01:11:52,147 --> 01:11:53,940
Beat it!

1020
01:11:55,526 --> 01:11:59,821
That nigger bouncer never lets us in!

1021
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:01,781
We know his bro for 10 years!

1022
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:05,160
And he still gives us shit!

1023
01:12:05,619 --> 01:12:07,370
Drives me crazy!

1024
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:10,457
What's up with the flare gun?

1025
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:13,252
Where you going?

1026
01:12:13,585 --> 01:12:15,128
Don't be a hot dog!

1027
01:12:17,923 --> 01:12:19,090
Stop!

1028
01:12:19,758 --> 01:12:22,635
I told you I'd be back!

1029
01:12:24,262 --> 01:12:26,180
Not so big now, fuckface!

1030
01:12:26,348 --> 01:12:29,642
You and your stinkin' club!

1031
01:12:29,976 --> 01:12:33,104
Fuck your club!

1032
01:12:33,271 --> 01:12:35,648
Goddam nigger!

1033
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,876
That cop made us miss it.

1034
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,755
Dickless fuckin' Tracy!

1035
01:13:12,352 --> 01:13:14,062
When's the next one?

1036
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:15,897
Tomorrow morning.

1037
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:58,856
How much did Snoopy owe you?

1038
01:13:59,023 --> 01:13:59,773
What?

1039
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:01,650
What'd he owe you?

1040
01:14:01,818 --> 01:14:03,069
One.

1041
01:14:03,236 --> 01:14:05,446
$1,000?
- No, $100.

1042
01:14:05,655 --> 01:14:06,739
What?

1043
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:09,283
All this shit for a lousy $100!

1044
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:12,202
It's the principle that counts.

1045
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:15,998
Principle!

1046
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:20,711
Coyote's a bad motherfucker.

1047
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,464
Roadrunner's a pussy.

1048
01:14:23,756 --> 01:14:26,216
Pick between Tweetie and Sylvester.

1049
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:28,677
Fuck you and Tweetie!

1050
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:31,972
I don't take shit from a guy who sees cows!

1051
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:35,517
I say Sylvester's the real gangsta.

1052
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:38,019
Bottom line! 'Nuff said!

1053
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:41,857
Can't talk with you guys if you won't listen.

1054
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:43,650
'Cause you listen?

1055
01:14:43,818 --> 01:14:46,362
You got it all wrong.

1056
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:50,658
I say Tweetie's the baddest. He always wins.

1057
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,534
That's bullshit!

1058
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:55,663
Sylvester fucks Tweetie and you!

1059
01:14:56,288 --> 01:14:57,622
Come again?

1060
01:14:58,374 --> 01:15:00,584
Who does he fuck? Me?

1061
01:15:00,793 --> 01:15:02,711
Anyway, Sylvester's a black brother.

1062
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:04,504
A black brother?

1063
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,089
Full of shit!

1064
01:15:06,799 --> 01:15:09,176
Shall we, gentlemen?

1065
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:11,178
What can we lose?

1066
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:22,605
It's positively frightful!

1067
01:15:29,613 --> 01:15:31,323
Is this guy famous?

1068
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:36,036
He will be when he grows up!

1069
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:56,890
There's Champagne, Cinzano, Bogardi...

1070
01:15:57,099 --> 01:15:58,892
I don't drink.
- I mean Bacardi.

1071
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,059
Outta my way.

1072
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:03,021
I want peanuts.

1073
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:08,026
Cheers, Charles!

1074
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,486
Hey, Charles!

1075
01:16:10,654 --> 01:16:13,448
Behave, asshole!

1076
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:18,453
Let 'em through, Sayid!

1077
01:16:19,663 --> 01:16:21,456
Check out the babes!

1078
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,624
That's what I call women!

1079
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,461
The sister is hot.

1080
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:29,171
Do me a favor.

1081
01:16:29,339 --> 01:16:31,049
I'm not going!

1082
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:33,927
Who bought the tacos last week?

1083
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:36,221
You owe me one.

1084
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:37,722
Get me the sister.

1085
01:16:38,056 --> 01:16:39,223
Awright.

1086
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:41,935
There's just two!

1087
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:43,603
Who cares?
- Shut up!

1088
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,938
Get her for me, Hubert!

1089
01:16:52,153 --> 01:16:54,530
Excuse me, my name's Hubert.

1090
01:16:55,031 --> 01:16:59,160
My friend's a romantic, he's really shy.

1091
01:16:59,327 --> 01:17:01,704
He'd love to meet you.

1092
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:03,331
That's him.

1093
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,459
What d'ya say?

1094
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:08,919
Look what you did to me!

1095
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:11,464
He's really cool.

1096
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:14,967
He's too nice.
- OK, then!

1097
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,469
C'mon Sayid!

1098
01:17:17,595 --> 01:17:18,679
Hold this.

1099
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:22,725
Haven't we met before?

1100
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:24,310
Don't I wish!

1101
01:17:24,477 --> 01:17:25,728
Hi, girls!

1102
01:17:25,895 --> 01:17:26,562
I'm Sayid.

1103
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,066
Please don't lean on the painting.

1104
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:32,318
You're the painting!

1105
01:17:34,195 --> 01:17:35,029
I'm good at what?

1106
01:17:35,196 --> 01:17:36,363
Guess, babe!

1107
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:38,408
We heard you were shy!

1108
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:41,995
Shy? That's my middle name!

1109
01:17:42,787 --> 01:17:45,331
What's your number? We'll go out.

1110
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:48,000
You're all alike!

1111
01:17:48,209 --> 01:17:50,336
He said you wanted to talk.

1112
01:17:50,545 --> 01:17:53,005
Talk? What about?

1113
01:17:54,382 --> 01:17:57,176
Lighten up! We were ready to talk,

1114
01:17:57,343 --> 01:18:01,430
but with your attitude,
how can we respect you?

1115
01:18:01,597 --> 01:18:04,975
Who are you? The Wonderbra bitch?

1116
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:07,603
Who asked you?
- I'm asking you!

1117
01:18:07,812 --> 01:18:09,438
He's nuts.

1118
01:18:09,856 --> 01:18:12,191
What are you staring at?

1119
01:18:12,692 --> 01:18:13,943
Got a screw loose?

1120
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:16,111
You're the screw.

1121
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:20,824
Stop!
- What's wrong with you?

1122
01:18:21,617 --> 01:18:25,120
Leave us alone, we didn't ask you over!

1123
01:18:25,288 --> 01:18:26,998
Gentlemen, please!

1124
01:18:27,164 --> 01:18:29,207
It's cool, Pops!

1125
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:33,212
Nobody's been hurt! What's your beef?

1126
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:36,257
Keep your heads, please.
- Please what?

1127
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:38,509
Let's go!

1128
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:40,677
Pretty please!

1129
01:18:40,845 --> 01:18:43,305
Let's all calm down!

1130
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:44,890
Stop that!

1131
01:18:45,057 --> 01:18:46,433
Stop your friend.

1132
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,352
You're not my friend! Fuck you!

1133
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,814
Know what?

1134
01:18:53,274 --> 01:18:55,401
Go suck cocks in hell!

1135
01:18:55,568 --> 01:18:58,946
With your mothers!
- You're all ugly!

1136
01:18:59,113 --> 01:19:01,657
I'm fuckin' sorry, sir!

1137
01:19:04,785 --> 01:19:06,995
Have fun, mothafuckas!

1138
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:11,709
Troubled youth!

1139
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:13,793
We shoulda swiped a bottle.

1140
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:16,963
I got the sucker's charge card!

1141
01:19:17,131 --> 01:19:19,800
Hubert! Up to your old tricks!

1142
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:22,052
Like riding a bike: You don't forget.

1143
01:19:22,219 --> 01:19:24,763
Mr. David Moe?

1144
01:19:26,932 --> 01:19:28,558
He's not here?

1145
01:19:29,309 --> 01:19:30,810
We keep it for him!

1146
01:19:30,978 --> 01:19:32,729
Give it to me.

1147
01:19:34,565 --> 01:19:36,316
What's the score?

1148
01:19:36,483 --> 01:19:37,650
Killer!

1149
01:19:38,068 --> 01:19:39,861
Know what I'm saying?

1150
01:19:41,238 --> 01:19:43,365
Your name's not David!

1151
01:19:43,532 --> 01:19:45,492
And cabs don't take plastic.

1152
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:46,910
Just this once.

1153
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:49,246
Gimme a break!

1154
01:19:54,001 --> 01:19:55,168
You fart?

1155
01:19:55,586 --> 01:19:57,004
It was you. Who else?

1156
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:59,547
It stinks. Had to be you.

1157
01:19:59,715 --> 01:20:00,799
That's not my stink.

1158
01:20:00,966 --> 01:20:02,467
I know your farts.

1159
01:20:02,634 --> 01:20:05,094
Mothafucka, we're locked out.

1160
01:20:10,851 --> 01:20:11,851
Who farted?

1161
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:13,394
He did.
- He did.

1162
01:20:15,188 --> 01:20:17,064
Can't you tell?

1163
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:20,026
It was him.

1164
01:20:20,193 --> 01:20:22,403
Your ass reeks.

1165
01:20:23,405 --> 01:20:26,991
Motherfucking goddam steering wheel!

1166
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:29,286
Cut the poetry

1167
01:20:29,452 --> 01:20:31,328
and pull the thing!

1168
01:20:31,496 --> 01:20:34,916
Jean-Claude does this in five seconds flat.

1169
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:36,167
Which Jean-Claude?

1170
01:20:36,376 --> 01:20:37,376
The mailman?

1171
01:20:37,586 --> 01:20:41,172
No, that's Sylvie's boyfriend.

1172
01:20:41,339 --> 01:20:43,799
This guy got 2 years for car theft.

1173
01:20:44,009 --> 01:20:46,219
Move it, bust the fucker!

1174
01:20:46,386 --> 01:20:49,639
Use your foot!

1175
01:21:11,286 --> 01:21:12,620
Don't be a sissy.

1176
01:21:12,787 --> 01:21:15,164
Who's a sissy?

1177
01:21:19,752 --> 01:21:21,879
Relax, Max.

1178
01:21:31,848 --> 01:21:35,226
"Night of the Living Car!"

1179
01:21:37,228 --> 01:21:39,104
The wipers!

1180
01:21:43,818 --> 01:21:45,778
Rip open that plastic box.

1181
01:21:45,945 --> 01:21:47,696
Open sesame!

1182
01:21:50,032 --> 01:21:53,869
Connect the green wire to the red one.

1183
01:21:54,036 --> 01:21:56,413
Nah, that's for the blinkers.

1184
01:21:56,581 --> 01:21:58,958
How'd they do it in on TV?

1185
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:01,335
Fuck TV!

1186
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,256
Start the mother!

1187
01:22:09,177 --> 01:22:10,344
Who the fuck's he?

1188
01:22:12,597 --> 01:22:14,390
Freaked me out!

1189
01:22:15,474 --> 01:22:17,142
Who the fuck are you?

1190
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:18,978
Huh?
- What you doin'?

1191
01:22:19,145 --> 01:22:20,229
Nothing.

1192
01:22:20,438 --> 01:22:22,231
So go somewhere else.

1193
01:22:22,398 --> 01:22:24,399
Move, you'll get us nabbed.

1194
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:25,734
It's my wife...

1195
01:22:25,943 --> 01:22:27,027
What about her?

1196
01:22:28,487 --> 01:22:29,362
She left me.

1197
01:22:30,322 --> 01:22:32,449
Do we fuckin' care?

1198
01:22:34,452 --> 01:22:36,579
Don't wait for the law, Start it.

1199
01:22:36,746 --> 01:22:38,539
Move!

1200
01:22:38,706 --> 01:22:40,916
The red wire to the green wire.

1201
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:43,752
Lay off, that's for the horn!

1202
01:22:43,919 --> 01:22:45,086
Try the blue, jerk!

1203
01:22:46,046 --> 01:22:49,466
You do it! If you're so smart.

1204
01:22:49,633 --> 01:22:50,800
I'll kill you!!

1205
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,388
You're a drag.

1206
01:22:55,306 --> 01:22:57,516
That wire's for the horn.

1207
01:22:58,392 --> 01:22:59,142
No, that's the horn!

1208
01:23:01,312 --> 01:23:03,147
Sayid's right.

1209
01:23:03,314 --> 01:23:05,232
You see?

1210
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:08,318
Who was right? We do it my way!

1211
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:10,111
Gimme some metal!

1212
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:11,738
Move it!

1213
01:23:13,032 --> 01:23:15,033
You're a good guy. What's your name?

1214
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:18,828
You got a name?

1215
01:23:21,373 --> 01:23:24,000
At least we put it to good use!

1216
01:23:25,544 --> 01:23:27,921
Ready? Watch this.

1217
01:23:40,934 --> 01:23:42,769
Anyone know how to drive?

1218
01:23:43,187 --> 01:23:45,731
Vinz does.
- Wait a second.

1219
01:23:45,898 --> 01:23:48,567
I never learned, I got no licence.

1220
01:23:48,817 --> 01:23:50,944
He does. He was in the Army.

1221
01:23:51,111 --> 01:23:53,404
The Navy! I can't drive.

1222
01:23:53,989 --> 01:23:55,240
I can!

1223
01:23:55,449 --> 01:23:56,825
Shut up!

1224
01:23:58,702 --> 01:23:59,702
Vinz?
- What?

1225
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:03,999
You took that bitch around Israel in a Mercedes.

1226
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:07,376
Not the same thing!

1227
01:24:07,544 --> 01:24:09,712
That was different. It was... uh...

1228
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,340
It was an automatic...

1229
01:24:12,883 --> 01:24:13,800
More like a dream!

1230
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:18,554
You guys are so lame!

1231
01:24:21,475 --> 01:24:23,101
Now what?

1232
01:24:24,853 --> 01:24:28,189
Sorry, but a cop car's coming.

1233
01:24:28,356 --> 01:24:30,399
Where?
- That's a cop car.

1234
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:31,567
It's real close.

1235
01:24:34,321 --> 01:24:36,698
On three, we're outta here, OK?

1236
01:24:37,324 --> 01:24:38,033
Ready?

1237
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:38,699
Three!

1238
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:47,667
Freeze!

1239
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:53,464
Out of the way!

1240
01:25:10,523 --> 01:25:13,192
Sometimes you feel so fuckin' small...

1241
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:15,736
Got any more bullshit wisdom?

1242
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,823
"The early bird catches the worm."

1243
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:21,450
"A stitch in time saves nine."

1244
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:24,620
"Haste makes waste."

1245
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:27,247
"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."

1246
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:30,584
I save that one for special occasions.

1247
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:33,671
Holy fuck!

1248
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:36,382
I'm wasted.

1249
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:38,801
Your shit is dope!

1250
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:41,887
Sayid, watch it!

1251
01:25:43,473 --> 01:25:44,390
He's a big boy!

1252
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:46,517
Spray cans!
- You're the can!

1253
01:25:47,435 --> 01:25:50,938
What was that old guy
in the john trying to say?

1254
01:25:51,105 --> 01:25:54,650
Talked about God and shitting.
What was the point?

1255
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:56,235
I see skinheads.

1256
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:57,653
You're the skinhead.

1257
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:58,737
Fuck Nazis!

1258
01:25:58,905 --> 01:26:01,365
The point is: God's inside you,

1259
01:26:01,574 --> 01:26:03,117
so He helps you dump!

1260
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:05,577
God loves your bowels.

1261
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:06,870
Pass the joint.

1262
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:11,708
Check this shit out:

1263
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:16,838
"Pinhead is to skinhead,
as teeny is to weenie."

1264
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:19,216
Get my drift?

1265
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,092
Out of the way.

1266
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:35,315
Vinz, Know the one about the guy
falling off a skyscraper?

1267
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:38,652
On the way down he says to himself:

1268
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:43,406
"So far so good...
so far so good..."

1269
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:48,203
I heard it with a rabbi.

1270
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:53,083
Like us in the projects. So far so good,

1271
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:55,085
but how will we land?

1272
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:59,047
I feel like an ant lost in intergalactic space.

1273
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,095
Watch, I'll switch off the Eiffel Tower.

1274
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,478
That only works in movies.

1275
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,021
Mothafucka!

1276
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:16,440
You in a movie?

1277
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,441
In a porn flick with your mother!

1278
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:20,360
Look who's talking!

1279
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:23,863
Yours sticks carrots up her ass!

1280
01:27:25,908 --> 01:27:28,035
You're the carrot!

1281
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:39,171
THE WORLD IS YOURS

1282
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:53,977
THE WORLD IS OURS

1283
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:05,404
How did they get the car in the gym?

1284
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:08,116
Search me... Ask God!

1285
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,033
Very funny.

1286
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:21,713
Look at those sheep in the system.

1287
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:26,884
They look cute in their fancy leather jackets.

1288
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:28,678
But they're scumbags.

1289
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:32,390
They ride escalators, carried by the system.

1290
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,309
They vote far right, but aren't racists.

1291
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:38,646
They can't move without escalators.

1292
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,439
The worst!

1293
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:44,819
Racist!

1294
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:25,902
WAR IN BOSNIA

1295
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,370
ABDEL ICHAHA DIES

1296
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:01,812
Where's Vinz?

1297
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:11,864
Mothafucka!

1298
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:32,259
What?

1299
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:35,721
Dumb fuck!

1300
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:38,807
What did I do?

1301
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:42,018
Why hit me?

1302
01:30:45,856 --> 01:30:47,399
What did I do?

1303
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:51,152
What'd I do, asshole?

1304
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,863
You suck big time!

1305
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,614
So what'd I do?

1306
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:56,992
Help me, Sayid! Please.

1307
01:30:57,159 --> 01:30:59,911
Help you what? What'd I do?

1308
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:01,330
Abdel's dead now!

1309
01:31:01,538 --> 01:31:03,331
He's sick of your shit!

1310
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:04,583
What shit?

1311
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,877
What the fuck I do?

1312
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:11,465
You wanna kill a pig, go right ahead.

1313
01:31:12,966 --> 01:31:14,676
But you're on your own.

1314
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:16,637
We're outta here.

1315
01:31:20,724 --> 01:31:22,225
Get lost.

1316
01:31:22,726 --> 01:31:24,352
Both of you!

1317
01:31:25,979 --> 01:31:28,648
I don't need you!

1318
01:31:32,027 --> 01:31:35,071
I know who I am and where I come from!

1319
01:31:35,238 --> 01:31:37,698
So go home and shut up!

1320
01:31:37,866 --> 01:31:40,243
Fuck your mother!

1321
01:31:57,302 --> 01:31:58,636
Don't bug me, Sayid.

1322
01:31:58,804 --> 01:32:00,430
Think we should've...

1323
01:32:04,059 --> 01:32:05,393
Just what we need!

1324
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,727
A nigger!

1325
01:32:08,188 --> 01:32:11,399
You're the fucker who dissed us
from the roof!

1326
01:32:11,566 --> 01:32:13,693
The gang banger from the roof?

1327
01:32:13,902 --> 01:32:16,571
Let's see you fight!

1328
01:32:20,325 --> 01:32:21,743
Hold him!

1329
01:32:26,581 --> 01:32:29,125
Come back!

1330
01:32:29,334 --> 01:32:31,044
You fuckin' asshole!

1331
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:32,211
I done nothing!

1332
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:34,088
Faster than a speeding bullet?

1333
01:32:34,255 --> 01:32:36,548
I done nothing!

1334
01:32:37,258 --> 01:32:38,509
Check it out!

1335
01:32:40,095 --> 01:32:41,346
Whadda you say?

1336
01:32:50,188 --> 01:32:52,481
Get the fuck in there!

1337
01:33:02,575 --> 01:33:04,034
Whatcha gonna do?

1338
01:33:06,329 --> 01:33:08,164
You think I'm all talk?

1339
01:33:08,331 --> 01:33:10,332
I'm all talk?

1340
01:33:12,669 --> 01:33:16,255
Watch! Don't try and stop me!

1341
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,925
Vinz, don't do it!
- Let him!

1342
01:33:21,219 --> 01:33:22,845
Do your good deed!

1343
01:33:23,596 --> 01:33:24,596
Shut up!

1344
01:33:25,348 --> 01:33:26,807
There are good cops.

1345
01:33:26,974 --> 01:33:29,976
But the only good skinhead is a dead one!

1346
01:33:30,478 --> 01:33:31,979
Shoot him.

1347
01:33:32,146 --> 01:33:35,482
We took your shit all day.
Fuckin' shoot him!

1348
01:33:36,192 --> 01:33:37,443
You got the piece.

1349
01:33:41,447 --> 01:33:42,698
Shoot!

1350
01:33:45,326 --> 01:33:45,951
Shoot!

1351
01:33:50,665 --> 01:33:52,124
Fuck his mother!

1352
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,584
Shoot!

1353
01:33:56,921 --> 01:34:00,174
Abdel's dead! Get even, for fuck's sake!

1354
01:34:00,341 --> 01:34:02,134
Do it for Abdel!

1355
01:34:06,389 --> 01:34:07,389
Shoot!

1356
01:34:17,775 --> 01:34:19,776
Get outta here!

1357
01:34:48,722 --> 01:34:50,265
See ya tomorrow.

1358
01:35:03,487 --> 01:35:04,738
Take it.

1359
01:35:08,992 --> 01:35:10,660
Gonna sing a love song?

1360
01:35:10,828 --> 01:35:12,204
Go home, loser.

1361
01:35:12,371 --> 01:35:15,415
Let's go, Vinz.

1362
01:35:15,624 --> 01:35:17,042
Later, Hubert.

1363
01:35:17,918 --> 01:35:19,836
Hear the one about the nun?

1364
01:35:20,003 --> 01:35:22,463
This drunk guy comes out of a bar,

1365
01:35:22,673 --> 01:35:26,176
and walks up to a nun in this big black cape.

1366
01:35:26,343 --> 01:35:29,971
Wham! He slugs her in her teeth.
She goes down

1367
01:35:30,138 --> 01:35:32,807
and he keeps on pounding her.

1368
01:35:34,559 --> 01:35:36,811
After about 5 minutes he stops,

1369
01:35:37,187 --> 01:35:39,564
looks at her and says:

1370
01:35:39,773 --> 01:35:41,774
"You're not so tough, Batman!"

1371
01:35:41,942 --> 01:35:44,152
That's a killer!

1372
01:35:44,486 --> 01:35:46,529
He thought the nun was Batman!

1373
01:35:46,696 --> 01:35:48,906
I heard it with a rabbi.

1374
01:35:49,991 --> 01:35:50,991
Over here, you!

1375
01:35:51,409 --> 01:35:52,785
What's the matter?

1376
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:54,621
I know you!

1377
01:35:57,374 --> 01:35:58,875
You were on the roof!

1378
01:36:10,595 --> 01:36:12,179
What're you doin'?

1379
01:36:13,974 --> 01:36:15,850
Got a problem, you fuck?

1380
01:36:16,351 --> 01:36:18,352
Scared without your pals?

1381
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:20,771
Not so tough now!

1382
01:36:20,939 --> 01:36:23,232
Look at him!

1383
01:36:50,385 --> 01:36:52,637
It's about a society falling...

1384
01:36:52,804 --> 01:36:57,016
On the way down it keeps telling itself:

1385
01:36:57,308 --> 01:36:59,143
"So far so good...

1386
01:37:00,019 --> 01:37:01,812
"so far so good...

1387
01:37:02,772 --> 01:37:04,899
"so far so good..."

1388
01:37:06,401 --> 01:37:08,402
How you fall doesn't matter.

1389
01:37:09,988 --> 01:37:11,656
It's how you land!

1390
01:37:12,305 --> 01:38:12,274
