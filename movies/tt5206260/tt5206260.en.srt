1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,125
<i>If you love stories
about families that stick together</i>

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:18,833
<i>and love each other through thick and thin
and it all ends happily ever after...</i>

3
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,708
<i>this isn't the film for you, okay?</i>

4
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,250
<i>This is my city. I've seen it all.</i>

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,666
<i>Look at 'em.
Boring people living boring lives.</i>

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,291
<i>I'm not judging.</i>

7
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,625
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

8
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,416
<i>I've stared into a lot of windows, okay?</i>

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,291
<i>I've seen happy families, supportive
families, functional families. Ugh.</i>

10
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:48,083
<i>But the best stories are always
in the windows where nobody looks.</i>

11
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,125
<i>No, look down.</i>

12
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,916
There they are. Hidden.

13
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,125
I'm the narrator, by the way.

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,458
And a cat. Get over it, yeah?

15
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,333
This family's story is weird, you know,

16
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,833
hidden away from the modern world
in their old-fashioned home.

17
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,833
I'll show you around.
Fantastic mouse hunting here.

18
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:12,958
When I say "old-fashioned,"
I mean they go back a long way.

19
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:20,416
A family legacy of tradition, invention,
creativity and courage.

20
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:25,458
Their greatness passed down
like their magnificent facial hair

21
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,750
from generation to generation
to generation.

22
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,666
Until this one.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,708
- I so love being a Willoughby with you.
- Oh, smoopsy buns. I'm so happy!

24
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,666
Let's jump ahead a few months,

25
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,166
when this loving
and perfect marriage produced...

26
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,208
Well, you know.

27
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,375
- What is that?
- Oh, dear.

28
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,416
I'm your father,

29
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,875
and that sweet woman that you insulted
with your rude birth is Mother.

30
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:12,291
If you need love, I beg of you,
find it elsewhere. Thank you.

31
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,166
Oh, you are Tim,

32
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,541
and you are a Willoughby.

33
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:19,958
Good day, sir.

34
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,958
<i>His loving parents
had no love left over for Tim.</i>

35
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,750
<i>All they gave him was his name.</i>

36
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,125
Ooh!

37
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:32,833
<i>Willoughby.</i>

38
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,791
Oh. Willough...

39
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,833
...by.

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,083
<i>Oh, and siblings.</i>

41
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,958
<i>A sister named Jane...</i>

42
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,625
Our parents will hear you!

43
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,375
<i>...and twin brothers,
both named Barnaby. They're creepy.</i>

44
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,218
- Thanks, Barnaby.
- You're welcome, Barnaby.

45
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,208
Why are we staring at this wall?

46
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,583
Because, Jane, we are Willoughbys.

47
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,916
<i>Okay, this Willoughby story
is odd, all right?</i>

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,166
<i>But it's not all bad. At least
they ate every family meal together.</i>

49
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,041
<i>And by "they," I mean these two.</i>

50
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,333
- You like it spicy, don't you?
- Oh, I don't just like it...

51
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,166
I loaf it.

52
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,125
<i>They just forgot to share
with their kids.</i>

53
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,333
I do not predict leftovers.

54
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,583
But I'm so hungry
I just want to eat my own tongue.

55
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,750
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

56
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:30,666
Us, too.

57
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,333
What if we dress a Barnaby up like food...

58
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,500
- Bad idea.
- Terrible idea.

59
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,583
No, Jane.

60
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,916
Okay, then, what if I go?

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,184
- Stop what if-ing!
- Yeah.

62
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,041
No what-ifs.

63
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:43,000
I know you're hungry,
but Willoughbys do not beg for food.

64
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,833
We wait.

65
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,208
Oh.

66
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,666
May we have food?

67
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,083
- Food?
- We eat today's food.

68
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,375
You eat yesterday's food.

69
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,416
But you ate all
of yesterday's food yesterday.

70
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,791
So there is no food left over for... Jane!

71
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,791
Huh? My name is Mother. Who is this Jane?

72
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,541
You call your mother names,
and you expect us to feed you?

73
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,875
- No, no, no.
- No?

74
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,625
I mean...
Yes, Mother. Don't!

75
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,583
Don't?

76
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,458
You do not tell your mother
what to do not do!

77
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,458
- You selfish boy. You ate it all.
- No, I didn't!

78
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,458
Oh, Father,
I'm going to starve.

79
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,208
It's that girl!

80
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,791
- She brought the small one.
- They are creepy.

81
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,083
Hi, Mommy.

82
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,250
What are they doing here?

83
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,392
- Nothing.
- Bye, Mommy!

84
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,041
- They're, uh, going...
- Hungry.

85
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,666
These children, always wanting.

86
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,101
- We're fine. Jane!
- The Barnabys could use another sweater.

87
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,416
- One's good.
- We like one.

88
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,976
- Barnabys!
- You want two.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Stop talking.

90
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,708
- Look at me, I'm fretting.
- Dreadful.

91
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,000
- I'm all a-fret.
- Appalling.

92
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,000
- I can't knit!
- This is all your fault!

93
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,875
My fault? Wha...

94
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:08,791
Son, you insist on bothering us
with your childish needs.

95
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,125
Go to the coal bin!

96
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,916
Good day, sir.

97
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,166
<i>Poor Timothy.</i>

98
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,583
<i>That's a rotten place for a hairless kid
in short trousers, innit?</i>

99
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:29,333
Sometimes,
I wish I wasn't a Willoughby.

100
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,541
We used to be great.

101
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:49,333
We were soldiers and scientists,
kings and philosophers,

102
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,708
explorers and aviators, artists and poets!

103
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,750
We climbed the unclimbable,

104
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:59,541
and we always ate together...
at tables, like a family,

105
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:04,958
where every Willoughby had a mustache,
even the women.

106
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,541
We could be great again.

107
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,666
No...

108
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,750
We will be.

109
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:19,541
Against all odds, the Willoughby children
still had determination...

110
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,291
- Nice job, Barnaby.
- You, too, Barnaby.

111
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,750
Bye-bye, dirigible!

112
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,416
...imagination...

113
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,541
and hope.

114
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:39,625
<i>♪ Through the glass, over the hedge ♪</i>

115
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,666
<i>♪ Follow the rainbow to... ♪</i>

116
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,166
- Quiet!
- I can't knit!

117
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,666
<i>♪...where my dreams begin... ♪</i>

118
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,916
She can't knit!

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,875
I will be free.

120
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,166
If she misses a stitch...

121
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,875
- I feel faint!
- Oh, Mother, sweet.

122
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,958
Ugh!

123
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:03,416
Let's face it.
This Willoughby family isn't great,

124
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,833
and by the looks of it,
they never will be.

125
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,083
<i>Not without a little help.</i>

126
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:14,250
<i>Maybe it was the dark and stormy night,
maybe I've looked in one too many windows,</i>

127
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,708
<i>but this story got to me.</i>

128
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,750
<i>I know, narrators aren't supposed
to get involved, but just a little nudge.</i>

129
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,458
<i>A well-timed cat's...</i>

130
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,203
- Something's outside.
- Definitely something outside.

131
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,958
- Jane.
- There's something outside.

132
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,416
That's a yowl. A beastly yowl.

133
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,833
Wow! What a mystery.
It's like we're in a book.

134
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,184
- Come on, Barnabys.
- Bad book.

135
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,666
Scary book!

136
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,791
Shh! They're still awake.

137
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,541
Dance, dance for your papa.

138
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,250
What kind of a beast yowls like that?

139
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,875
I'm really scared. Are you scared,
Barnabys? 'Cause I'm scared.

140
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,166
Maybe we shouldn't...

141
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,351
Do you remember that book
about beasts with all the drawings

142
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,000
of teeth and claws
and huge piles of half-eaten kids?

143
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,083
- Don't.
- Stop talking.

144
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,458
It was a lot of blood,
wasn't it, Barnabys?

145
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,059
- Blood is bad.
- I'm gonna have a quick look

146
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,500
to see if it's dangerous.

147
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,666
If it is, run. Different directions,
zigzaggy and stuff.

148
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,958
- So it can only eat one of you.
- What's this feeling I'm feeling?

149
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,083
- Fear. Fear.
- Definitely fear.

150
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,416
Remember, twins, zigzaggy.

151
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,958
Zigzag. Zigzag. Zigzag.

152
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,875
Stand back, Barnabys.

153
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,226
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>

154
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,375
<i>'cause I'm thinking
exactly the same thing:</i>

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,583
<i>What's in the box?</i>

156
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,958
<i>And can we empty it so I can sit in it?</i>

157
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,500
Hi, beast. I'm Jane.

158
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,000
I hope you're a nice beast
because, um, we're nice.

159
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,291
Please don't eat our faces.

160
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,958
Father, I love the smell
of fresh yarn in the morning.

161
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,708
Gah! Parents already up? Despicable!

162
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:02,250
Harvesting your mustache
makes such lovely yarn.

163
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,916
Do it!

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,750
- Mmm-hmm.
- Ugh. How am I gonna get by?

165
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,083
Keep going.

166
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,833
I knit, you provide. It's simple.

167
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,291
Was that always...

168
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,791
Oh! You want Mother to have yarn,
don't you?

169
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,958
You must. You like the sweaters.

170
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,541
Oh, pretty!

171
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,708
There you go. Phew.

172
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,791
Huh?

173
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,791
Jane? Twins?

174
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,041
Great Uncle Edmund! Shh!

175
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,416
They'll hear you.

176
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,166
We must be quiet
while Mother and Father are still...

177
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,083
Tim!

178
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,375
Here beastie, beastie, beastie.

179
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,934
- Jane! What are you...
- Over there.

180
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:53,791
Catch it.

181
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,250
- Get it!
- Get it!

182
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,333
Are you harboring a raccoon again?

183
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,333
Pfft. No.

184
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,416
That is something!

185
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,625
Is it more of a some or more of a thing?

186
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,291
- Get it!
- What is that?

187
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,291
- Aw!
- A baby!

188
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,166
- No thumping!
- I can't knit!

189
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,333
Shh!

190
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,000
Where did you get that thing?

191
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,416
We found her outside, living in a box.
She's an orphan.

192
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,767
- Smells like an orphan.
- Looks like an orphan.

193
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,833
Got a box like an orphan.

194
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,541
<i>♪ Orphan friend, box all alone ♪</i>

195
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,184
- Why are you singing?
<i>- ♪ We're glad you came here... ♪</i>

196
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,583
We are getting rid of it at once.

197
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,017
Give me that!

198
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,666
- No!
- Gimme! Gimme!

199
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,333
Jane! You know our parents hate children,

200
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,583
and babies are the most
childish children of all!

201
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,416
Well, I love her and nobody's gonna
take her away from me.

202
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,300
- Barnabys, bring it to me.
- Yes, Tim.

203
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,958
Hey! Barnabys, give me back my orphan.

204
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,000
- You got it, Jane.
- Barnabys, thing.

205
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,958
- Sorry, Tim.
- Barnabys, orphan.

206
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,059
- Yes, Jane.
- Ah, Barnabys.

207
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,184
- You got it, Tim.
- Barnabys.

208
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,601
- Barnabys. Barnabys.
- Barnabys. Barnabys.

209
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,875
Barnabys. Barnabys. Barnabys!

210
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,958
Barnabys! Orphan?

211
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,166
- Got away.
- Pretty fast.

212
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,125
What?

213
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,375
The beast is loose!

214
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,166
Oh, no, no, no!

215
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,208
Huh?

216
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,708
- What is it?
- A baby.

217
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,083
Oh, not again.

218
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,708
- Why does this keep happening, Mother?
- Parents!

219
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,750
How are you... Oh.
Parents, I got this. I got this.

220
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,458
Stay.

221
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,208
Do not move a baby muscle.

222
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,708
Get it off. Get it off.

223
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,000
Get it off! Get it off!

224
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,750
- Ooh.
- Roasted baby.

225
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:54,875
No!

226
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,666
- Mother's balls are burning.
- No.

227
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,083
Yes.

228
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,750
Ball burner.

229
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,583
Barnabys, catch her.

230
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,416
No, no, no. Oh!

231
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,208
Gotcha, you little rascal.

232
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,750
Oh.

233
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,166
- It's not even a Willoughby.
- Is this thing yours?

234
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,041
- No.
- What? No, I didn't...

235
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,916
You eat our food, sleep in our coal bin

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,333
and now you expect us
to rear another child?

237
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,666
- He's always doing this.
- What? No.

238
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,625
- I mean, we've tried everything.
- Ignored him.

239
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,291
- Coal bin.
- Neglected him.

240
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,833
- Coal bin.
- It wasn't me.

241
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,666
- Never played with him.
- Coal bin.

242
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,559
You'd think that would work!

243
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,166
Nope! Nothing works.

244
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,208
I can't knit!

245
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,583
Oh, Mother, sweet.

246
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,583
- Children.
- I wish we could kick them all out.

247
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,708
Ooh.

248
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,375
- I've decided to kick you all out!
- Do it, Father.

249
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,458
But my home!

250
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,083
Do not return till that thing is gone!

251
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,791
- You are...
- Do it. Do it.

252
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,375
- ...punished!
- Yes!

253
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,708
- This is all your fault!
- What? It's their fault.

254
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,375
We should kick them out.

255
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,125
How will we restore honor
to House Willoughby

256
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,333
if we are not living
in the Willoughby house?

257
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,041
- Ugh. But...
- We have to get rid of it, fast.

258
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,208
No, Tim!

259
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,708
Oh, the ordeal is over.
Let us return to our home.

260
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,250
What? What? How!

261
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,041
Tim, she needs a home,
and if we don't help her,

262
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,708
we're as bad as our parents,

263
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,458
who keep sullying
our great Willoughby name.

264
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,833
They have sullied it so much.

265
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,625
I know where we can find
the perfect home. Follow me.

266
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,726
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hello, outside!

267
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,166
Outside? But... I've never...

268
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,416
<i>I guess it's hard
to leave home for the first time.</i>

269
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,333
<i>Although, I was six days old when I left.</i>

270
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,708
<i>All my folks ever did for me</i>

271
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,083
<i>was lick my eyeballs open,
sent me packin'.</i>

272
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,375
<i>He'll be all right. Maybe.</i>

273
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:26,000
- Jane! Where are we going?
- To the end of the rainbow.

274
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,291
End of the rainbow? How far is that?

275
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,541
Not far. Right, orphan friend?

276
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,875
<i>Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.</i>

277
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,750
<i>Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Walk.</i>

278
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,458
- Ooh!
- Barnabys!

279
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,250
Excuse me. Coming through.
Yep, sorry.

280
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,166
Excuse me, excuse me.
Jane, the people! The people!

281
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,250
This way.

282
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,875
Wait for me!

283
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,166
Yes! Over here.

284
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,000
Jane! I got pee in my shoes.

285
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,250
Are we getting close?

286
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,291
We're almost there.

287
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,208
This looks like the bad part of town.

288
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,583
Self-taught.

289
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,166
Look at that.

290
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,583
Isn't it wonderful? The perfect home.

291
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,041
<i>Usually
in old-fashioned stories,</i>

292
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,958
<i>rainbows have treasure at the end,
don't they?</i>

293
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,000
<i>Not this one.</i>

294
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,416
"No trespassing"? Well, that's a bust.

295
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,125
- Look! Duckies!
- Jane.

296
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,875
- Factory!
- Barnabys!

297
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,375
No!

298
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,625
Hi, duckies! They're so chubby!

299
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:12,500
Barnabys! Jane!

300
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,208
Willoughbys do not trespass!

301
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,875
The perfect home. Yay!

302
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,500
- It's a candy factory!
- So many machines.

303
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,916
So many buttons.

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,333
- Levers. Levers. Levers.
- Buttons. Buttons. Buttons.

305
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,291
<i>♪ Under the rainbow, I will spin ♪</i>

306
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,333
<i>♪ The perfect home for my best friend ♪</i>

307
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,833
Wow!

308
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,750
Rainbow food? This place has everything.

309
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:46,291
- Hey!
- Orphan has a home. We go home.

310
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,791
We can't just leave her outside.
It's not safe.

311
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,250
What if there are... wolves?

312
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,375
Wolves?

313
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,666
Here.

314
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,833
You found her in a box?
We leave her in a box.

315
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,875
- Wolves do hate boxes.
- Balance restored.

316
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,708
Um, uh... Tim, wait!

317
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,416
What if we gave her a name?

318
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,000
A proper three-syllable name,
like, uh... oh, Taffeta!

319
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,791
T-A-F-F-E...

320
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,458
Hey!

321
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,041
- Her name is Ruth.
- Ruth?

322
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:24,500
Yes. Because re-orphaning her
makes us the ruthless Willoughbys.

323
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,875
Now be ruthless and say goodbye.

324
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay.

325
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,416
Oh, Ruth.

326
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,125
I'll always know where to find you.
At the end of the rainbow.

327
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,916
To home!

328
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,875
Jane!

329
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,708
Who disturbs my work?

330
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,291
We're trespassing!

331
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,125
Who...

332
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,708
Huh...

333
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,000
What is in my box?

334
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,041
Ruth? You're not candy.

335
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:22,750
Such a magnificent mustache.
This is the perfect home.

336
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,875
I really hope we're doing the right thing.

337
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,500
Of course we are, Jane.

338
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,041
A great man with a great home
must have a great family.

339
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,583
Just imagine what
that lucky orphan's life will be like.

340
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,250
Ugh. I wish we had a home like Ruth,

341
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,833
where we didn't have to steal food
and nobody would say,

342
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:48,958
"Shut up, Jane!"

343
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:53,291
Oh, we would eat at a table
like the great Willoughbys of old.

344
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,375
Our mustaches would grow long,

345
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:59,041
and no one would ever have to go
to the coal bin again...

346
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,458
unless they wanted coal.

347
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,125
- I want a factory.
- Big factory.

348
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,625
Wait. We could have all of that.

349
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,375
Except for the factory.

350
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,291
How?

351
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,000
What if we became orphans?

352
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:16,375
That is your iffiest what-if yet.
We have parents.

353
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,559
- Bad parents.
- Terrible parents.

354
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,250
But what if we didn't?
It's like in the books.

355
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,583
Pollyanna's died of cholera in India.

356
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,083
James, that peach fellow's parents
were eaten by a hippo.

357
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,375
I thought it was a rhinoceros.

358
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,458
Think about how great our family
could be if they were gone.

359
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,083
Jane, are you seriously suggesting...

360
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,250
We orphan ourselves. Yes!

361
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,250
- Ghastly!
- Ruthless.

362
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,166
No! Getting rid of an orphan is one thing.

363
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,166
How do you propose
we discard of two insidious grown-ups?

364
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,250
Easy.

365
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,791
- No!
- No. Not there. There.

366
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,416
- No!
- No. There.

367
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,291
Wha...

368
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:07,666
...$999, and all your troubles
will be gone for good.

369
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,708
- You'll love it.
- Gone for good?

370
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,375
A folded piece of shiny paper?

371
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:24,791
We can send them away.
What if we orphaned ourselves?

372
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,125
Yeah. Cracking idea, Tim.

373
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,083
To home!

374
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,083
I love this plan.

375
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,791
Okay, humans, calm down.
Don't get all sensitive.

376
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,291
"Ooh! This is bad."
It's nature. It'll work out.

377
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,333
<i>Look, these kids needed a change. Y'know?</i>

378
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:48,333
<i>I did warn you
this story wasn't all fluffy and fuzzy.</i>

379
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,708
<i>Oh, blimey, those are sharp scissors.
Watch the eyes!</i>

380
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,000
We shall craft a murderous adventure

381
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,875
that gives our insidious parents
exactly what they want.

382
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,875
To be left alone with their love.

383
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:04,500
Precisely. A romantic getaway,
hiding deadly orphaning opportunities.

384
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,000
<i>If they do not melt
in the hottest places on Earth...</i>

385
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,166
<i>...they shall drown in the wettest.</i>

386
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:18,000
<i>Cannibals will feast
unless they freeze in glacial ice,</i>

387
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,250
<i>or dissolve in fields of acid first.</i>

388
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,166
<i>They shall not escape the bears,
but if they do,</i>

389
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,541
we have saved
the deadliest spot for last...

390
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,708
the Unclimbable Alp...

391
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:40,291
in Sveetzerlünd.

392
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,833
He who goes up does not come down.

393
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,208
The Reprehensible Travel Agency.

394
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,250
No children allowed.

395
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,666
- Behold!
- Wow.

396
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,208
Mmm.

397
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,458
Ah. Exquisite.

398
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,125
- What?
- Hmm?

399
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,083
- Father.
- Yes, poopsie.

400
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,666
What is it?

401
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,916
- Hmm.
- What does it say, Fatherkins?

402
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,833
- "See the world."
- See the world?

403
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,166
"Have adventures."

404
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:01,583
I'd love to have an adventure!

405
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,625
- You know what else, Mother?
- What, Father?

406
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,416
No children allowed!

407
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,375
I would love that.

408
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,250
Do the hula, my love.

409
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,708
You make me spin whirlybird style.

410
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,208
No. Stop. Wait.

411
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:26,083
If we leave these children here alone,
they'll ruin everything.

412
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,166
Oh.

413
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,416
What if we didn't
leave them here alone? Huh?

414
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,750
We could get them a nanny.

415
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:38,125
But aren't good nannies expensive?

416
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:43,041
Yes, Mother. So we'll hire
a not-good nanny for cheap.

417
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,916
<i>To adventure.
Are they gullible or what?</i>

418
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,750
<i>I mean, I never thought
they'd fall for it. Did you?</i>

419
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:53,541
Oh, you are my muse, flipsy-poop. Mmm.

420
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,666
Now that's gonna be a fun ride.

421
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,583
Go on, pick me up.

422
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,375
Put me in sideways.

423
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,218
Mother's been friends
with her fork.

424
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:03,875
Well, that was easy.

425
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:06,333
- To adventure!
- Ooh!

426
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,016
Everyone got what they wanted.

427
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,500
To adventure!

428
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,791
All good.

429
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,833
Told you this would work out.

430
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,166
They're gone? We did it.

431
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,583
- We...
- Are...

432
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,375
Orphans!

433
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:24,083
Whee-hee!

434
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:35,041
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

435
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,041
Orphan home. Orphan home.

436
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,291
Whoo!

437
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,375
Whoo!

438
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,916
Hmm...

439
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,541
You are punished!

440
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:42,416
Great Edmund, enjoy thy wall.

441
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,625
<i>Willoughby...</i>

442
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,458
<i>Timothy,
you are the man of the house!</i>

443
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:58,250
<i>With great responsibility
comes great mustache.</i>

444
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:05,250
<i>Tim, Tim, Tim...</i>

445
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,208
<i>Tim, Tim, Tim.</i>

446
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,000
Tim.

447
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,958
Tim!

448
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,541
- Tim!
- Is it morning?

449
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,750
- We're hungry.
- Haven't eaten in hours.

450
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,250
- Days. Starving.
- What's food?

451
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:27,166
I hear your childish needs,
and as man of the house, I will provide.

452
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,250
<i>See?
Told you this would all work out.</i>

453
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,833
Let the greatness begin.

454
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:35,666
<i>Oh, Tim.</i>

455
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,916
Warm thy Willoughby self.

456
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,583
Simply divine.

457
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,500
Dinner is served!

458
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:18,875
A proper meal for a proper family.

459
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:24,250
Delicious lobster on a bed of coal! Ta-da!

460
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,750
Tim, is that from the wall?

461
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,291
- Old lobster.
- Really old.

462
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,625
Old food
is the best food.

463
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,958
I'm going.

464
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,833
What? You're skipping the cheese plate?

465
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,666
Charcuterie mouse!

466
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,375
- This is getting weird.
- I pass.

467
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,458
<i>I'll eat it.</i>

468
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,416
What? Hey!

469
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,458
Where the Willoughby are you going?

470
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:54,958
Out. Ruth has rainbow food
at her place and...

471
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:59,291
We did not orphan ourselves
so you could go toodle-doodling,

472
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,166
eating fancy rainbow food
with your friends.

473
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,291
I am an orphan and I do what I want.

474
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,791
- No, you can't.
- I can.

475
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,708
- You shan't.
- I shan!

476
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,958
- No, you...
- Hello!

477
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,541
- Stranger.
- Danger.

478
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,875
Trespasser!

479
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:18,375
Fear not, skinny orange boy,
for I am your nanny!

480
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,916
No, I'm in charge!

481
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,541
I've read about nannies.
What kind of nanny are you?

482
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,041
Did you fly in on the east wind
or the west?

483
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,041
- West.
- Where's your umbrella?

484
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,226
- Here.
- Do you eat children?

485
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,583
- Sometimes.
- Why are you here?

486
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,583
I was hired by your loving parents.

487
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:32,706
Loving?

488
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,791
Parents?

489
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:38,583
I've got no qualifications,
but a cheery disposition.

490
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:45,083
Here to service all your childish needs.
I cook, clean... sing!

491
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,541
What? You sing?

492
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:51,250
- Yeah! All nannies sing.
- I sing, too.

493
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:55,500
What if we sing together?

494
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:56,458
Yeah!

495
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,000
Everybody, come on!

496
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,833
Never trust a nanny.

497
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,791
Ow!

498
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,625
Whoa!

499
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,666
- This is amazing.
- Yay!

500
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,958
- Insidious!
- I love it!

501
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,434
What is she doing
to Jane's head?

502
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:25,458
- Now it's pointy.
- And she looks younger.

503
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,583
Devil woman.

504
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,458
- We have to get rid of her.
- Rid of her?

505
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,083
- Fast.
- Ooh.

506
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,791
Nanny is working for our parents,
and now she's brainwashed Jane.

507
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:41,666
She has to go. But how?
Perhaps another brochure.

508
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,791
- How about this, Tim?
- It'll work.

509
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,208
What the Willoughby is that?

510
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,250
- It's a nannapult, Tim.
- Nannapult?

511
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,750
Nanny goes here, in the nanny-cup.

512
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,041
Lever.

513
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,166
- Nanny gone.
- Problem solved.

514
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,583
Whoa!

515
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:05,791
This is... a terrible idea.

516
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,916
First off, too many levers.

517
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,958
Do you honestly think
she's just gonna walk right in here

518
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,125
and plop herself down in your nanny-cup?

519
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,916
This is the library.

520
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,583
The twins mostly do stuff here.

521
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:22,375
Wow.
Did you little mushroom heads make this?

522
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:25,166
A bouncy chair?

523
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,583
- Whoa, it looks like a nanny-cup.
- Bouncy...

524
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:31,916
You guys are like little baby
Albert Einsteins but with weirder hair.

525
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,708
- What are your names?
- Lever.

526
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,458
- That's Barnaby.
- And that's Barnaby.

527
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,750
- Both of you? Okay.
- Pull it.

528
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,833
What if I call you Barnaby A?

529
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:43,000
- Do it!
- And you're Barnaby B?

530
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,517
- Lever!
- I can tell them apart now.

531
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,083
- I like B.
- I like A.

532
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,625
- I love all the levers! Or is it leaver?
- No, no, no.

533
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,125
- Lever.
- No, leaver.

534
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,208
Can I pull it?

535
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,583
Whoa! Fun. Ooh, what's this one do?

536
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Nothing, huh?

537
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,125
- Who's hungry?
- Yay!

538
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,041
Stupid nannapult.

539
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:13,875
Not great. Oh, look at them over there,
chewing food in their mouths,

540
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,791
- eating it up. Ugh!
- Skinny Bones?

541
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,833
- What's his deal?
- Jealous.

542
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:24,000
- Definitely jealous.
- Yeah. It's a classic power struggle.

543
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,250
Hmm.

544
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:29,166
Traitorous Willoughbys.
More like Will-not-be's.

545
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,000
Will not eat Tim's food.

546
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,250
Hey, Tim.

547
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,500
I know you miss
your old-fashioned parents.

548
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:40,875
Change is hard. I've been there.
I think maybe you just need to eat.

549
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,250
- What? No, no, no.
- Come on. Here we go.

550
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,291
- Hmm.
- Put some oats on those skinny bones.

551
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,708
Tim, you have to try this. It's so good.
Way better than that wall lobster.

552
00:32:55,791 --> 00:33:00,000
Willoughbys do not eat oats.

553
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,375
I know you can do this, Skinny Bones.
Now eat.

554
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:10,916
No, thank you.

555
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,500
- Eat.
- Nope.

556
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:15,625
- Eat.
- No.

557
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:16,892
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

558
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:17,750
- Let go.
- You let go.

559
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,791
- Eat.
- No!

560
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:29,750
You disrespect my oats, you disrespect me.

561
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,916
I have no choice but to put you in...

562
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:39,250
The coal bin? I was gonna say time-out.

563
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:43,666
You know, I have no choice
but to put you in a time-out.

564
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:48,875
Why in the world would your parents
ever put you in a coal bin?

565
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:50,166
Having childish needs.

566
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,458
- Like food.
- Sweaters.

567
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:52,541
Love.

568
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:53,833
Oh, taking in an orphan.

569
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,958
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You took in an orphan?

570
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,250
Yeah, we did.

571
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:02,458
But she was a baby, and babies
are the most childish children, so...

572
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,458
We got rid of her.

573
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:08,250
What? Back up the abuse caboose.
Where'd you get rid of a baby?

574
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,833
The perfect home.

575
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:16,250
Oh, this is the worst home ever.
Poor little orphan.

576
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:20,791
We should not be trespassing.
Disturbing this great man's work.

577
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,541
What great man?

578
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,750
Who disturbs my work?

579
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:32,125
Wait a minute. Commander Melanoff is real?

580
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,000
Um, yes.

581
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:38,791
Wow. That is a...
That's a strong fashion choice.

582
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,541
- Do you dress like that every day, sir?
- I, uh...

583
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,375
- Are those medals candy?
- Uh, maybe.

584
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,250
- Can Ruth come out?
- No! Go away!

585
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:50,416
- Hey! Hey! Where's the orphan, candy man?
- Shh.

586
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,791
- No!
- Baby!

587
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,500
- Ruth!
- Factory!

588
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,750
Oh, diddly-do.

589
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,208
- May I touch your mustache?
- What?

590
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:01,666
Uh-oh.

591
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,750
- Baby? Where is she?
- Ruth!

592
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,625
This is bad.

593
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,750
We have to get her
before she has a sugar crash.

594
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:17,208
Oh, no, no, no. Not again.
You trespassers! Stay!

595
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,708
Yes, great one.

596
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:25,708
Oh, baby. No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

597
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,000
Nuts and nougat,
nuts and nougat.

598
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,250
Oh, diddly-doodle.

599
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,333
Ah! Not the candy crusher.

600
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:04,583
Ruthie!

601
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,916
Gotcha!

602
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,458
- Ooh, that was exciting.
- Okay, but we're supposed to be staying.

603
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:18,041
Ruth!

604
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:22,125
You! Big-haired lady.
Give me back my baby!

605
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:25,625
Your baby? I don't think so, sugar daddy.

606
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,375
A nanny knows things,

607
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:32,708
and this nanny knows these messed-up
Willoughbys left a baby on your doorstep.

608
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:38,750
Wait, are you the angels
who brought her to me?

609
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,625
- Uh...
- Maybe.

610
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,625
I wouldn't call them angels, exactly.

611
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:50,333
- Oh, my.
- What are you feeding her?

612
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:57,041
<i>Candy! I'm Commander Melanoff,
and I live in the land of fun!</i>

613
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,500
- Whoa.
- A moving painting?

614
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:02,291
How did they get
the tiny people in the box?

615
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:06,458
Ruthie likes it, don't ya?
You like those toasty oats.

616
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,833
All kids love oats.

617
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:14,000
So, you're like the real
Commander Melanoff? You're famous?

618
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:20,541
Well, maybe.
I do make every tasty treat myself.

619
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:22,916
Do you live here alone, or...

620
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,416
Yes. Well, I did.

621
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Ruth moved in
and she needs a lot of attention.

622
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,500
'Course she does, don't you, baby girl?

623
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:37,083
How could something so tiny
make so much poop?

624
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:40,958
- I haven't slept in nine days.
- Oh, that explains a lot.

625
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,458
I called Orphan Services for help, but...

626
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:46,625
Orphan Services?
No, you shouldn't have called them!

627
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:49,750
Well, I mean, "Find an orphan
you don't know, call..."

628
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,458
- Oh, oh.
- Oh, oh.

629
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:56,833
No. Giving a baby to them
is like locking a puppy up in a cage.

630
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:59,625
Oh, my! I love puppies.

631
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,500
It's a good thing I hung up, then.

632
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,041
Oh, you did?

633
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:09,166
You see, I've grown fond
of her childish needs.

634
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:13,375
I want her to stay.

635
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,208
Okay, but...

636
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,250
This factory isn't baby proofed.

637
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,625
She can't just eat candy
for the rest of her life.

638
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:26,333
I mean, next thing you know,
she's going off to college, she could...

639
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:30,291
She could be a doctor.
Maybe she'll write the next <i>Moby Dick,</i>

640
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,875
or paint the next <i>Mona Lisa.</i>
Fly an airplane to the moon.

641
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,166
I mean, she could be the next president.

642
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,416
You know? And then you're gonna
have to go to the White House

643
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,250
and maybe not wear a candy suit,
you know? It's a lot.

644
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,583
That sounds sweet.

645
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:54,875
It's time for this candy man
to become a family man,

646
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,083
who also makes candy.

647
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:00,791
Well, if you ever need help,
you know who to call.

648
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,958
Oh, the service for orphans.

649
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,416
What? No, Skinny Bones!

650
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,083
You could call me. You know, I'm a nanny.

651
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:13,000
- I will.
- Just put your number in there.

652
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:17,208
If you ever need a candy factory, or...
Ooh!

653
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,750
Yay! The perfect home.

654
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:26,791
Oh,
you Willoughbys are wonderful.

655
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,625
Here, son, catch!

656
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,041
Whoa.

657
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:39,250
- Is this a hug?
- I don't know. But I like it.

658
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:51,750
Aww. Unfortunately, these Willoughby kids
would soon get some disturbing news

659
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:55,000
that their parents were still alive.

660
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:04,958
<i>They say that love conquers all.
It does for these two.</i>

661
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:30,333
<i>How many lives
have these cats got?</i>

662
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:36,916
Oh, Father, I do so love
adventuring with you.

663
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,500
- Oh!
- Bug.

664
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:44,458
Unfortunately, Mother, our adventuring
is soon to be over. We are broke.

665
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,833
Does that mean we'll have to...

666
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:49,416
Ugh. Go home. I'm afraid so.

667
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,583
You mean, back to that old-fashioned home?

668
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,791
- Yes.
- Oh!

669
00:40:55,875 --> 00:41:00,875
If only there was a way that we could
reach across time and space

670
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,125
and just sell it.

671
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,375
Uh, you could always use the Internet.

672
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,208
- Ina...
- Nets?

673
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:12,000
Uh, see here. Old-fashioned homes go
for a lot these days.

674
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:15,625
Oh, my.

Piranhas!

676
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:20,333
- What in blue blazers is this thing?
- So many pictures.

677
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:21,916
Ooh. I get it.

00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:33,583
I will take care of them."

799
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:36,500
Why are you being all evil?

800
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,500
Hear it in my voice, okay?

801
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:42,500
As for the children,
let me take care of them.

802
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:43,416
Oh.

803
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,375
When you say it like that,
I do wanna be taken care of.

804
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:53,458
Tim, I might work for your parents,
but my duty is to look after you guys.

805
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:56,458
I should have told you
they were selling the house.

806
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm sorry.

807
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:01,666
But I just couldn't bear to break
your weird little hearts.

808
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,791
Oh, thank you, Nanny.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

809
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:05,892
Any time, tiny girlfriend.

810
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,476
- Wanna hug Nanny.
- Huggy.

811
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,166
Get in here, you little mushroom heads.

812
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:13,125
Hug us will all six arms.

813
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,958
Tim, are you okay?

814
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,291
Thank you.

815
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:27,833
Aww, Skinny Bones.

816
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,541
Huh?

817
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,583
What?

818
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,309
<i>Department of Orphan Services is on site.</i>

819
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:38,208
<i>- Unit 4. Cut off the exits.</i>
- Orphan Services? We have to go. Now!

820
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:39,491
<i>No children in or out.</i>

821
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:42,041
Hurry, kids. Stick with me. Come on.

822
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,601
- Where are we going?
- Back door.

823
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:46,333
- No, follow me. Come on, you two.
- Nanny, what's happening?

824
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:51,041
It's okay. Stay together. Come on.
Come on. Don't panic.

825
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:03,750
We have reason to believe
a bad nanny is harboring orphans.

826
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:04,750
Orphans?

827
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:08,083
As a Willoughby,
I demand you leave our home.

828
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,125
You're the orphan.

829
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:11,083
Yes.

830
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:14,125
No, no, no. They have parents.
You leave them alone.

831
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:17,708
Linda? Is that you?

832
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,291
Uh, yeah.

833
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:22,291
- Linda?
- But I'm a nanny now.

834
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:24,916
Are you wearing toilet paper again?

835
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,875
Yes, I am, but it...

836
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,041
Oh, you look ridiculous.

837
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,583
It's a costume. I was...

838
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,791
Once an orphan, always an orphan.

839
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:33,916
Uh...

840
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,916
Nanny? You're an orphan?

841
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,208
No, I mean, I was. I mean... I...

842
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,125
I am.

843
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:44,583
We tried to find her a home,
but no one ever wanted her.

844
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,708
That's not true. We want her.

845
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,750
See? They want me.

846
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:50,250
Oh, Linda.

847
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:56,166
<i>I'd like to report
a bad nanny. We do not want her.</i>

848
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,250
Tim?

849
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,375
That's you? Your voice?

850
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:01,000
- Tim.
- How could you?

851
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:02,125
No, no...

852
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:05,750
Oh, children can be so, so cruel.

853
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,500
- I didn't mean...
- You did.

854
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,458
I was just trying to be a good nanny.

855
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:12,250
- But you are...
- No longer required.

856
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,458
No, you are required.

857
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:18,791
Go, Linda,
before these children hurt you more.

858
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:22,666
Nanny, don't. Please!

859
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:26,541
Jane...

860
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,666
You did this.

861
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,125
I didn't mean...

862
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,958
You lied about Nanny.
You made me get rid of Ruth.

863
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:34,041
That was our parents.

864
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,500
- Always just bossing me around.
- Jane...

865
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:39,416
You're a mean,
mustacheless, short-panted...

866
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,041
- No!
- Fighting children must be separated.

867
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,416
You can't.

868
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,541
For your own good.

869
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:46,208
No!

870
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:52,041
You will adopt
standard childhood experiences.

871
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:55,333
Homes will be allocated.
Schools will be assigned.

872
00:52:55,416 --> 00:53:00,583
Until your biological parents return,
you are officially orphans.

873
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:01,583
No!

874
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,250
Have a nice childhood.

875
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:06,000
Stop! I don't want to go!

876
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:09,916
- Help! I don't wanna go!
- Let me out! Let me out!

877
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,583
- Tim?
- Jane?

878
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:12,892
Please. You can't do this.

879
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:15,250
<i>All children
collected and protected.</i>

880
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:16,333
- No.
<i>- Good work, team.</i>

881
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:26,750
These poor kids. Alone, scattered, lost.

882
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:31,250
Like me, really.

883
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:35,333
The Barnabys were cared for
in a modern home,

884
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:39,958
<i>plugged into the Internet,
their little brains flooded with...</i>

885
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:42,333
<i>Well, you've been on the Internet.</i>

886
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:50,041
<i>Jane's hosts believed in
the healing power of music.</i>

887
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:53,000
You okay, kiddo?

888
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:56,875
<i>But Jane's song was gone.</i>

889
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,458
<i>Her what-ifs? No more.</i>

890
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:08,000
<i>Tim resisted change, running away from
well-meaning families like the Wilsons,</i>

891
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,083
<i>the Walters,</i>

892
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:12,458
<i>the Waddingtons.</i>

893
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:17,208
<i>He wanted his old-fashioned
Willoughby life back.</i>

894
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,708
Sold?

895
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:26,625
No, no, no, no!

896
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,791
<i>But it was gone.</i>

897
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:37,500
<i>No home. No family.
Someone's gotta look after him.</i>

898
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:40,916
<i>This is unit three.
We have him.</i>

899
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,083
<i>It's tough out there,
in the city.</i>

900
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:47,375
<i>Sometimes, you're the cat.
Sometimes, you're the mouse.</i>

901
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:49,583
<i>At least he's got a box.</i>

902
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:59,041
<i>Okay, it's a bit dark, but, uh, y'know.</i>

903
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:05,833
<i>Poor Nanny tucked her tail
and ran away from her past.</i>

904
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:07,541
<i>Y'know, never look back.</i>

905
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:12,083
<i>'Course, it's nobody's fault, really.</i>

906
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:18,666
<i>Fine. I'll stop the bus.</i>

907
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,666
<i>Happy now?</i>

908
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:31,333
Let me off. Let me off!

909
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:34,791
What the Willoughby?

910
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:45,666
<i>This is good, right? Exciting.</i>

911
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:53,125
Oat time.

912
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,041
Hmph. Not hungry.

913
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:04,000
Oh, I think you are, Skinny Bones.

914
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,750
Huh? What...

915
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:08,458
Hungry for freedom.

916
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:09,916
Nanny?

917
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,291
Call me Phil.

918
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,184
Get in the oat cart.

919
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:14,125
I'm busting you out.

920
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:18,208
I do not deserve
this busting you speak of.

921
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:23,750
Leave me, Phil, to my short-panted guilt.

922
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:31,083
Oh, pity party, huh?
Guess I didn't get my invitation.

923
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:35,166
Sure, you screwed up.

924
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I screwed up, too.

925
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:42,416
I left you kids there alone. I ran away.

926
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,791
But I came back,

927
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:48,791
and I'm not leaving here
without a Willoughby.

928
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:52,041
I'm just a Will-not-be.

929
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:58,666
All I wanted was to be
a great Willoughby with a great family.

930
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,625
Hey!

931
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,833
- Are you saying Jane's not great?
- No!

932
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,708
- Barnaby A's not great?
- No.

933
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:06,125
- Barnaby B's not great?
- Ow!

934
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:09,416
- You're not great?
- Okay, okay, I get it! Stop!

935
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,375
Look, Skinny Bones,
you have a family.

936
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:18,125
They need you and you need them.

937
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:22,416
My head protector.

938
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,041
Let's blow this pop stand
and do something great, bro-bro.

939
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:33,083
Let us get blowing, brother-brother.

940
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,958
I admire your ruthlessness,
but this is crazy.

941
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,583
Shh. Almost there.

942
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,833
I mean, uh, uh...

943
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:51,666
Just taking the oats
for a walk.

944
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:55,291
Oats love walking. Come on, oats.

945
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,833
- Is there an orphan in that cart?
- Uh...

946
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:01,791
Phil?

947
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:05,250
Oh, boy, orphan in an oat cart?
I've never heard of such a thing.

948
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:07,291
That's preposterous.

949
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,375
Uh, don't touch that.

950
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:10,958
Don't look in there.

951
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,125
Oh, my! My back!

952
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,833
How dare you?

953
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:17,791
You think oats grows in fields, Phil?

954
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:21,041
Do you know how long
we have to soak these oats

955
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,666
so they're soft enough
we won't choke a child?

956
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,833
Code Blue! She's not a real Phil!

957
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:27,500
It's Linda!

958
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:30,000
- Stop right there, fake Phil.
- Nanny!

959
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,083
- Tim?
- Ow!

960
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:33,833
She's stealing an orphan.

961
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:35,458
He's not an orphan.

962
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:37,708
And she's not a Linda.

963
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,291
- I'm Phil.
- Phil this!

964
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,875
Ow!

965
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:43,375
Whoo-hoo!

966
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:44,458
Gotcha.

967
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,416
She's getting away. Stop that Linda!

968
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:50,916
I knew Phil had a sweet car!

969
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:58,333
Nanny, the gate!

970
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:00,583
Gate, schmate. Phil ain't no sheep.

971
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:10,101
<i>We have stories
of people in very different contexts...</i>

972
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:13,291
You know,
it is nice to see Linda taking initiative.

973
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,375
Hmm.

974
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,833
<i>Tonight, a skinny-boned boy</i>

975
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:31,500
<i>escapes a juvenile detention center.
The hunt for his...</i>

976
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,875
Tim was in a box.

977
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:37,017
Barnabys.

978
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:38,250
I need your help.

979
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:39,875
- Okay, Tim.
- Sure, Tim.

980
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:41,166
Let's go!

981
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,291
- Nope.
- No?

982
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,416
What do you mean, no? We have to hurry.

983
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,541
No need to hurry. We got the drums, baby.
We got the drums.

984
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,500
Jane, please.

985
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:55,875
We're not the Willoughbys
without your what-ifs.

986
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:57,458
Hmph!

987
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,208
What if... I say I am sorry?

988
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:08,750
What if you did?

989
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,333
What if you accept my apology?

990
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:13,166
What if you stop telling me what to do?

991
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,041
What if you stop getting me into trouble

992
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:19,625
and stuck in a coal bin while you get
to play with orphans and eat meatloaf?

993
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,416
I accept your apology.

994
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,500
- What?
- Yay!

995
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:25,208
<i>♪ Tim says he's sorry ♪</i>

996
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,791
<i>♪ 'Cause he was wrong
About all the things I'll list... ♪</i>

997
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:29,958
DOS. Open the door.

998
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:31,958
We gotta go.

999
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,750
- Can I help ya?
- We're looking for missing children.

1000
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,208
Oh, they've been found, mister.

1001
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:40,958
Bye!

1002
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:47,791
As long as they think you guys
are orphans, they will never give up.

1003
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:51,208
There's only one way out of this.

1004
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:56,916
You're not going to like it,
but what if we get our parents back?

1005
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,208
- What?
- Parents?

1006
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,392
Nanny, hands on the wheel, please.

1007
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:04,833
Sorry. Sorry.
But you guys have bad parents.

1008
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:09,250
Yes, I know they're despicable,
but they're the only ones we've got.

1009
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:14,208
Look, the Orphan Service lady said
that if our biological parents return,

1010
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:16,083
we can stay together.

1011
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:18,958
We have to get them back.

1012
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:22,083
Well, we do know where they're heading.

1013
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,333
Sveetzerlünd.

1014
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:25,750
He who goes up...

1015
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:28,083
Does not come down.

1016
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,083
- Careful.
- Huzzah!

1017
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:40,541
Aren't these pointy hats
splendid, snugglebug?

1018
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:45,416
Those pitons add such brawn
to your manly feet.

1019
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,416
To adventure!

1020
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,101
<i>How could such clever kids
come from these two?</i>

1021
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,583
<i>I mean,
this is Darwinism at work, isn't it?</i>

1022
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:08,500
<i>Ugh. Do we really have to save them?</i>

1023
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:14,458
Willoughbys?

1024
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:19,333
I love your factory. I need your factory.
Give me your factory.

1025
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:21,750
Tonight.

1026
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:23,625
Hiya, Mel.

1027
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:26,333
We have to build something
to get us to Sveetzerlünd.

1028
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:28,958
Okay.

1029
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:40,666
- Plan A.
- Plan B.

1030
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,750
Do it.

1031
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,500
Whoo-hoo! Yay!

1032
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:17,041
Mmm.

1033
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:26,250
Whoo!

1034
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:48,333
That's what I call a dirigible.

1035
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:51,000
- Nice work, Barnabys.
- Good dirigible.

1036
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,208
Delicious dirigible.

1037
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:54,375
To Sveetzerlünd.

1038
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:57,375
Easy, Ruthie.

1039
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,416
All right, you kids go pee.
I'll be right back with the oats.

1040
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,583
- Yes. Oats.
- Whoo!

1041
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:06,708
Look at this.
Ruthie wants to help.

1042
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,458
It's almost like...

1043
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:12,166
They're a family.

1044
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:16,750
<i>Starting route
to Sveetzerlünd.</i>

1045
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:23,583
Ah, Sveetzerlünd.
You're gonna love it there, Ruthie.

1046
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:27,250
The land of chocolate, cheese and knives.

1047
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:29,208
Whoa!

1048
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:32,458
What? Tim!

1049
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:49,000
Do you think Nanny will be mad we
snuck out and ran off with the dirigible

1050
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:49,916
and stole her phone?

1051
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,291
- And her purse.
- She is definitely mad.

1052
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:56,125
But we orphaned ourselves.
We will unorphan ourselves.

1053
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:04,083
I'm alive! I'm finally alive!

1054
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,583
Check it out.

1055
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:07,166
Whoa.

1056
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:11,625
As these Willoughbys flew east
towards the sunrise,

1057
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:14,833
I'm just along for the ride, in this cone.

1058
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:16,750
I told you this story would be exciting.

1059
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:20,708
Will they reach their parents
in time? Dunno. I'm in a cone!

1060
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:28,791
A-ha. Unclimbable Alp, they say.

1061
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:33,166
Doesn't compare to the mounds of love
we've climbed, sweet Mother.

1062
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:36,875
Oh, Father, take me to the tippy top.

1063
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:40,541
What are you doing, you idiots?

1064
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:43,416
Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother.
Mother, dear!

1065
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,166
Ooh.

1066
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:52,000
- Oh, look, snow.
- Ooh.

1067
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,041
Fill her up, buddy.

1068
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:58,726
- Sugar in the drain pipe.
- Sugar in the gas tank.

1069
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,708
Good morning, we're going to stop
our parents from killing themselves.

1070
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,333
Bye!

1071
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:14,416
Yeah! Nice!

1072
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:17,750
Keep up, honey, keep up!

1073
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:21,166
So much better than walking.

1074
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:35,166
Barnaby, Barnaby, Barnaby...

1075
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:05,291
Huh?

1076
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:26,208
I don't believe I can...

1077
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:29,458
feel my nose.

1078
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:30,541
No.

1079
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:32,625
We're out of yarn.

1080
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:37,000
I can't knit!

1081
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:38,083
Oh, Mother, sweets.

1082
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:42,291
Father, we've made a horrible mistake.

1083
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:52,375
We must go back home.

1084
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:56,750
Oh, Mother,
you are my home.

1085
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:58,541
Oh.

1086
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:10,451
<i>You have arrived
at your destination.</i>

1087
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,583
There it is.

1088
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,500
Whoa.

1089
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,541
They could be anywhere up...

1090
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:29,750
There. Look.

1091
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:33,833
I suspect our parents
had something to do with that.

1092
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:35,333
They do make a mess of things.

1093
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:37,875
- Something outside.
- Definitely something outside.

1094
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:46,875
Looky, looky.

1095
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:54,625
Willoughby red. Human fibers.
Silky smooth. Father's tardigrades.

1096
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:56,166
I can't knit.

1097
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:57,833
Mother's yarn!

1098
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:01,833
- Yes!
- We got 'em now.

1099
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:11,541
Follow that yarn!

1100
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:14,250
Hang on, Willoughbys!

1101
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:16,916
I can't see a thing.

1102
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:21,666
No visibility.

1103
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,000
Ice to see you.

1104
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:26,583
Great pun, Jane.

1105
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:29,541
Oh, no! We're losing power!

1106
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:35,750
Barnabys, what's going on?

1107
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:38,208
- Altitude. Keep driving.
- We need more rainbow.

1108
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:47,000
Faster, guys!

1109
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:51,208
Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow.

1110
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:55,583
A-ha! Punch it.

1111
01:09:55,666 --> 01:09:59,291
Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow!

1112
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,458
Whoo!

1113
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:12,916
Unclimbable, but not unflyable.

1114
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:22,291
Look! The yarn leads right to...

1115
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:25,916
Oh, no!

1116
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,750
'Tis like a yard of graves.

1117
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,416
Hurry!

1118
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,083
They have to be here!

1119
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,583
- Split up!
- Splitting!

1120
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:53,791
Tree. Tree.

1121
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,875
- Tree here, too.
- Another tree.

1122
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:57,666
No sign of them.

1123
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:06,750
This is impossible!

1124
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:10,166
We're all going to freeze out here
if we don't find them.

1125
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:14,041
I hear something.

1126
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,517
Me, too. Definitely hear something.

1127
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:17,000
Is it a some or a thing?

1128
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:24,583
It is some and a thing. Go!

1129
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:32,791
- Not a tree!
- It's parents!

1130
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:35,166
Their kiss, it's still warm.

1131
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,000
Heaters. Fire.

1132
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,500
Come on. Come on.

1133
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:06,083
We have parents.

1134
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:07,625
- A mommy.
- And a daddy.

1135
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:12,208
Children?
Ah, Fatherkins, are we back home?

1136
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:16,708
No, dearest. On an alp.

1137
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,000
We have come to your rescue.

1138
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:21,083
Rescue? Us?

1139
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,375
But how?

1140
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:25,166
- We knew where you were going.
- We sent you away.

1141
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,810
The Reprehensible Travel Agency.

1142
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:27,875
The brochure?

1143
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:33,416
Mother's balls! This was... you?

1144
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,291
We wanted, um, to orphan ourselves.

1145
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,625
- But we were wrong.
- Very wrong.

1146
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:41,125
Oh, my.

1147
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:44,625
Look, we are not a perfect family.

1148
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:46,583
We're not even a good family.

1149
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:49,291
But you need us to get down this alp,

1150
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:52,958
and once we're down there, we need you
so that we can all stay together.

1151
01:12:55,166 --> 01:13:01,166
You don't have to love us,
but will thou be our parents again?

1152
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:04,166
Please.

1153
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:11,083
Oh, Father, maybe we were wrong.
We can do better.

1154
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,958
Shall we? For love.

1155
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:15,041
For love.

1156
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,583
- Get out of my way!
- Ugh.

1157
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:31,750
Would you look at that machine?

1158
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:34,375
Oh, I do love to fly.

1159
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:36,666
Run, Mother. Run as fast as you can.

1160
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,309
<i>I did not see that one coming.</i>

1161
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:40,642
- I didn't bring my running dress.
- Lift those limbs.

1162
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,791
Here I come, Father!
To adventure!

1163
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:57,041
Mother, where did you learn to drive?

1164
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:58,916
I thought you were driving, darling.

1165
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
<i>Unfortunately, the Willoughby
parents remained thoroughly...</i>

1166
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:04,583
- What do these pedals do?
- Oh.

1167
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:08,916
<i>...incredibly
and utterly selfish.</i>

1168
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:09,916
Oh, dear.

1169
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:31,250
Huh.

1170
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:35,041
Any chance they survived that?

1171
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:38,416
I don't think so.

1172
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:47,791
<i>Oh, no.
All the determination, imagination.</i>

1173
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:53,208
<i>Doesn't matter how good you are, does it?
The world can be a pretty cold place.</i>

1174
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,541
We have to stay warm.

1175
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:57,625
Oh, Tim.

1176
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:01,750
It's frozen.

1177
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,208
Definitely frozen.

1178
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,809
- Hot!
- Get the hot.

1179
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,625
No! Barnabys! No! Stay together!

1180
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:09,541
Oh, the hot is gone.

1181
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:11,666
Tim, what do we do now?

1182
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,708
The yarn!

1183
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:20,000
We followed it up.
We can follow it back down.

1184
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:24,041
Tim! Come back! Please! We have to...

1185
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:33,125
No!

1186
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:38,791
It's hopeless.

1187
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,375
Come back.

1188
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:44,416
Cold.

1189
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,625
Sweater.

1190
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:49,916
No.

1191
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:58,333
One last what-if.

1192
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:12,791
- I heard something.
- Me, too.

Thank you.

1215
01:18:20,166 --> 01:18:23,000
Tragic.

1216
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:27,958
But remember,
this is an old-fashioned story,

1217
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:31,833
and as such,
it can't end like this, can it?

1218
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,083
Whee!

1219
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:47,166
Ruth?

1220
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:49,041
It's a Swiss gyrocopter.

1221
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,434
Whoo! There's a can opener!

1222
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:52,166
That's a corkscrew.

1223
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:53,708
Lickety twist!

1224
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:57,000
- Oh, Skinny Bones.
- Nanny?

1225
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:59,500
After all we've been through,
you abandon us? Oh!

1226
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,708
But how did you find us?

1227
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:03,708
We followed the rainbow into the storm.

1228
01:19:03,791 --> 01:19:05,791
Then Ruth heard your jolly jingle.

1229
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:11,041
You heard my song? Wow.

1230
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,625
It was beautiful, Jane.

1231
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,708
I'm sure your folks loved it.

1232
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:18,416
Speaking of folks, where are they?

1233
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,583
I want to tell them
how great their kids are.

1234
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:22,708
They stole our dandy dirigible.

1235
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,416
We have really bad parents.

1236
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,958
You mean had.

1237
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:28,583
We're orphans. For real.

1238
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:30,500
- What?
- Oh.

1239
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:31,625
No parents.

1240
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:34,416
- No home.
- No place to go.

1241
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,916
We've lost it all.

1242
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:38,958
But we have each other.

1243
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:45,708
Look, we sailed a candy dirigible
over an ocean,

1244
01:19:46,291 --> 01:19:48,250
climbed the unclimbable.

1245
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:50,958
- We didn't actually climb.
- I know, but it's a nice speech.

1246
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:55,041
So as long as we stick together,
we'll be okay.

1247
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,500
With or without parents.

1248
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,291
What if...

1249
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:09,458
We became a family?

1250
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,666
Hi, Mommy.

1251
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:16,500
I'm all in!

1252
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:19,875
Diddly-dee! Same with me!

1253
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:24,166
Commander, get us out of here.
It's too cold to be mushy.

1254
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,708
Grandy dandy!

1255
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:31,250
Why aren't we using the helicopter?

1256
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:34,791
We don't need no helicopters.
We're family.

1257
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:40,875
Okay, it's a bit weird,
all right?

1258
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:43,083
But we got there in the end.

1259
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:46,000
Determination, imagination, hope.

1260
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:48,625
Told you I know a good story
when I see one.

1261
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:51,291
The best stories
are the hard ones, y'know?

1262
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:58,625
Hmm! It's not bushy.

1263
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:00,916
Still, it is a mustache.

1264
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,434
I think we know
what that means, right, Tim?

1265
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:05,291
We're not doing
the great thing anymore,

1266
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:06,916
since that happened.

1267
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,708
Mustache.

1268
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,583
Well, if you ate your oats, Tim...

1269
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,750
you'd have hair everywhere.

1270
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:16,375
Maybe hairless Tim wants something new.

1271
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:19,291
I call it Melanoff meatloaf!

1272
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,500
Ooh.

1273
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:22,767
- Ruth.
- Oh, no, no.

1274
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:25,333
- Ugh. Oh.
- Ugh!

1275
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:28,750
Look, Tim.
Ruth has a meat mustache.

1276
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:30,916
Willoughby.

1277
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:37,333
Look at them,
a perfectly imperfect family.

1278
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:40,291
And while they didn't get
everything they wanted...

1279
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:41,500
Here we go!

1280
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:43,333
<i>...they got what they needed.</i>

1281
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:46,375
<i>I guess we all need love. Even me.</i>

you know.

01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:12,791
Oh, mushy buns,
I do love seeing the world with you.

Even the wet bits.

1287
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:19,666
Nothing will stop us
from adventuring, Mother.
