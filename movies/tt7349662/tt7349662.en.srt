1
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,880
Have you seen Dr. Meade?

2
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,314
Dr. Meade!

3
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,234
Oh, can you help me
find Dr. Meade?

4
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,433
God, help us.

5
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,073
God, save
the Confederacy!

6
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,193
Hello, my fellow Americans.

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,190
They say we may have lost the battle
but we didn't lose the war.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,950
Yes, my friends,
we are under attack.

9
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,110
You may have read about this
in your local newspapers

10
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,112
or seen it
on the evening news.

11
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,634
That's right.

12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,475
We are living in an era
marked by the spread

13
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,274
of integration
and miscegenation.

14
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,716
The <i>Brown</i> decision.

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,029
Ah-ah-ah!

16
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,397
The <i>Brown</i> decision,

17
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,915
forced upon us by
the Jewish-controlled puppets

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,559
on the U.S. Supreme Court,

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,597
compelling white children
to go to school

20
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,875
with an inferior race,

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,112
is the final nail
in a coffin...

22
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,275
Is the final nail
in a black coffin

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,876
towards America becoming
a mongrel nation.

24
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,596
We had a great way
of life. We had...

25
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,552
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma!

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,560
We had a great way of life.

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,751
We had a great way of life

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,634
until the Martin Luther Coons
of this world

29
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,632
and their army of Commies

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,473
started their
civil rights assault

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,679
against our holy white
Protestant values.

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,317
Do you really want your precious white child
going to school with Negroes?

33
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,710
<i>They're lying, dirty monkeys,</i>

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,520
stopping at nothing to gain
their equality with white men.

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,196
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Rapists, murderers,</i>

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,351
craving the virgin white...

37
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,159
- Is it "virgin pure"?
- Yes.

38
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,796
Rapists, murderers,

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,759
<i>craving the virgin pure
flesh of white women.</i>

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,680
They are super predators!

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,639
And the Negro's insidious tactics,
under the tutelage of high-ranking,

42
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,200
blood-sucking Jews,

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,671
using an army of outside
northern black beast...

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,910
What is it? "Black beast..."

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,356
- "Agitators."
- God, watch this! God!

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,032
Using an army of outside
northern black beast agitators

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,836
determined to overthrow
the God-commanded

48
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,470
and biblically inspired rule
of the white race.

49
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,956
It's an international
Jewish conspiracy.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,511
May God bless us all.

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,113
God
bless you, too, sir.

52
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,392
Why weren't you drafted
into the Vietnam War?

53
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,474
I went to college, sir.

54
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,960
How do you feel
about Vietnam?

55
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,640
I have mixed feelings, sir.

56
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,960
Would you call yourself
a womanizer?

57
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,111
- No, I would not, sir.
- You frequent nightclubs?

58
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,998
- No, sir.
- Do you drink?

59
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,231
Only on special
occasions, sir.

60
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,198
Ever done any drugs?

61
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,556
Only those prescribed
by my doctor, sir.

62
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,156
Well, that's kind of rare for a young,
hip soul brother like you.

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,277
Uh, yes, sir.

64
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,756
But my father
was in the military,

65
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,036
and my parents,
they raised me the right way.

66
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,874
How do you get along
with people, generally?

67
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,917
Sir, they treat me right,
I treat them right.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,276
Like I said before,
I was raised up the right way, so...

69
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,936
I mean, have you ever
had any negative...

70
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,111
What would you do if another cop
called you a nigger?

71
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Or worse.

72
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,390
Would that happen, sir?

73
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,552
Shit...

74
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,480
There's never been
a black cop in this city.

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,635
Now, if we make you an officer,
you will, in effect,

76
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,714
be the Jackie Robinson of
the Colorado Springs Police Force.

77
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,136
And if you know anything
about Jackie Robinson,

78
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,471
you know he had to take
a lot of, uh, guff

79
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,995
from his fellow teammates,
the fans,

80
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,480
other teams and the press.

81
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,359
I know the Jackie Roosevelt Robinson
story, sir.

82
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,638
Good. So, knowing that,
if somebody calls you a nigger,

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,439
will you be able
to turn the other cheek?

84
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,515
If I had to, sir, yes.

85
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Yes, I would.

86
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,995
Son, the mayor,
the Chief and I think

87
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,834
you might be the man
to open things up around here.

88
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,951
Chief Bridges will be
your Branch Rickey.

89
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,190
I'll have your back.

90
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,153
But I can only do so much.

91
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,472
The weight of this
is going to be on you

92
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,869
and you alone.

93
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,033
Thank you for the opportunity,
gentlemen.

94
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,069
- Wow. Cybill Shepherd.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,913
I loved her
in <i>The Last Picture Show.</i>

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,275
Never saw it.

97
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,953
I don't like
black-and-white movies.

98
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,555
So, what do you think?

99
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,996
I think she's
a really good actress.

100
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,470
Oh, come on. You know
you want some of that.

101
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,153
Looking for a toad here.

102
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,276
You're up.

103
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,871
Give me the record
for that toad, Maurice Smalls.

104
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,960
While you're at it,
grab another toad,

105
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,795
Tippy Birdsong.

106
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,039
T-I-P-P-Y.

107
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,396
Can I help you?

108
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,749
May I have
a minute, please?

109
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Sit.

110
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,472
Sergeant Trapp,
Chief Bridges,

111
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,360
I'll get right to it.

112
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,079
I'd like to be
an undercover detective.

113
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,833
What, like Narcotics?

114
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,591
Whichever department
works, sir.

115
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,399
You just joined
the force, rookie.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,480
I think I can do
some real good there.

117
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,074
- Is that right?
- I'm young.

118
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,149
There's a real niche for me.

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,594
Get in where I fit in.

120
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,713
You think a lot
of yourself, don't you?

121
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,194
I'll do
whatever it takes.

122
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,794
And I hate
the records room.

123
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,790
Well...

124
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,117
I think records is a good place for you
to start, rookie.

125
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,116
Chief, do you want me
clean-shaven?

126
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,032
I can even chop down
the natural.

127
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,115
No, no, no. You keep it.

128
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,356
I like the look.

129
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,198
I need a file on a toad.

130
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,150
You deaf?

131
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,794
I said I need
a file on a toad.

132
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,076
- No toads here.
- Excuse me?

133
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,629
I said I don't
have any toads.

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,312
I do have human beings.

135
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,437
You give me their names,
I'll get you the file.

136
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,838
I heard you think
you're hot shit,

137
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,240
but you ain't nothing
but a cold fart.

138
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,149
The name
is Steven Wilson.

139
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,119
Was that respectful
enough for you,

140
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,829
Officer Toad?

141
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,599
- Hello.
<i>- It's Bridges.</i>

142
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,114
<i>You sleeping?</i>

143
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,395
Uh, yeah, Chief.

144
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,630
Um...

145
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,279
Worked an all-night shift.

146
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,079
<i>I've changed my mind.</i>

147
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,992
<i>You're coming in
a little early today.</i>

148
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,480
<i>I got an assignment for you.</i>

149
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,030
<i>12:00 noon sharp.</i>

150
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,520
<i>Narcotics division.</i>

151
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,239
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Wear street clothes.</i>

152
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,515
Thank you.

153
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,510
CP time?

154
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,795
Jimmy, the rookie's late.

155
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,670
- You're late, rookie.
- Sorry. Won't happen again.

156
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,592
We have limited time,
so I'll be quick.

157
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,871
The black radical,
Stokely Carmichael,

158
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,952
is giving a speech tonight
at Bell's Nightingale.

159
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,079
- Yep.
- Carmichael is a former

160
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,436
high-muckety-muck
with the Black Panthers.

161
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,995
And as far as I'm concerned,
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

162
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,640
was dead right when he said
the Black Panthers

163
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,549
are the greatest internal threat to
the security of these United States.

164
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,472
This Carmichael joker,

165
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,116
former Panther or not, well,
they say he is a damn good speaker,

166
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,275
and so we don't want
this Carmichael

167
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,471
getting into the minds
of the good black people

168
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,678
here in Colorado Springs
and stirring them up.

169
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,956
Ron, your assignment is to go
to this speech tonight,

170
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,271
infiltrate this bunch
of subversives

171
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,432
and just monitor the audience reaction
to Carmichael's speech.

172
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,593
- You ready?
- Born ready.

173
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,115
I'm not ready.

174
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,553
Any chance
this thing fucks up?

175
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,472
Oh, fuck yeah.

176
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,596
Then what?

177
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,831
- Just stick to the game plan.
- Which is?

178
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,151
Eh, improvise.

179
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,118
- Like jazz.
- Like bebop.

180
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,776
This isn't some big bust.

181
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,519
We just want some intel.
That's it.

182
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,576
And what if someone offers you
a marijuana cigarette?

183
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,592
- You mean a joint?
- Yeah.

184
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,750
Mary Jane.

185
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,556
Excuse me.

186
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Soul brother,

187
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,079
I'm already high
on life. Can you dig it?

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,839
- It's dug.
- My man.

189
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,354
And if someone pulls
a gun on you?

190
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,635
Will that happen?

191
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,274
- Barrel of a.45 in your face.
- Shit.

192
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,192
Finger on the trigger.
Now what?

193
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,736
Blood, get that gun
out of my face.

194
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,830
Peace, love and soul.

195
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,030
Gun is still in your face.

196
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,511
I de-escalate,
talk calmly, firmly.

197
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,838
Find a way
out of there ASAP.

198
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,276
Relax. We'll be outside
listening in.

199
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,430
- Okay.
- Got it?

200
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,594
I got it. I'm gone.

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,036
Here we go.

202
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,115
- We need to take action.
- I can't believe he's here.

203
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,669
I just have so many
questions to ask him.

204
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,240
But, um...

205
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
How are you, uh...

206
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,360
How are you doing
this evening, my sister?

207
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,470
Can we help you?

208
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,235
I'm doing fine, my brother.

209
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,720
What? We don't know him.

210
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,678
What? Hakeem,
why you dragging me?

211
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,031
It's going to be
an amazing night.

212
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,520
Indeed, it is.

213
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,158
Have you heard Brother Kwame
speak before?

214
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,990
Who?

215
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,989
Kwame Ture.

216
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,198
Oh! Well, actually, I haven't, but...

217
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,160
- Okay.
- I didn't realize he changed his name.

218
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,279
Yes, after he
moved to Africa.

219
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,231
He took the names
of Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana

220
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,357
and his mentor,
Sékou Touré of Guinea,

221
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,556
to honor the great leaders.

222
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,592
- Well, that is heavy.
- Mmm-hmm.

223
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,512
You know how he got
to Colorado Springs?

224
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,957
Yeah, yeah.
The Colorado College Black Student Union invited him.

225
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,470
- Oh, I can dig it. I can dig it.
- Mmm-hmm.

226
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,671
Are you...
Are you part of the Union?

227
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,989
I'm the president.

228
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,795
Really? I'm talking
to the president right now?

229
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,200
Yes, you are.

230
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,600
Right on, sister.

231
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,433
Well, I bought a ticket.

232
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,751
May I skip the line since I'm talking
to the president?

233
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,073
There's no cutting
in line.

234
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,514
To the back.

235
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,829
<i>See you inside?</i>

236
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,776
<i>I'll see you inside,
my brother.</i>

237
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,917
<i>- Mrs. President.
- Right on.</i>

238
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,640
Ungawa, Black Power!

239
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,471
The Black Student Union
of Colorado College

240
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,314
is honored to bring the vanguard
of revolutionaries

241
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,279
fighting for the rights of black people
all over the world.

242
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,637
Let's show some black love

243
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,831
to the one and only,
the brother man with a plan

244
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,136
- who is sticking it to the man.
- Right on, right on.

245
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,200
Put your hands together,
my people, for our Kwame Ture.

246
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,393
Thank you, Sister Patrice.

247
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,551
- Thank you.
- And the Black Student Union.

248
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,552
I want to thank all of you,

249
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,517
my beloved sisters and brothers,
for coming out tonight.

250
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,636
Okay!

251
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,998
But I'm here tonight
to tell you

252
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,312
that it is time

253
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,120
for you to stop running away
from being black.

254
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,078
Boom-shaka-laka!

255
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,517
It is time for you to stop
running away from being black.

256
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,736
You're college
students, right?

257
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,016
- Right on.
- That's right.

258
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,076
You should think.

259
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,759
It is time for you
to understand that you,

260
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,035
as the growing intellectuals
of this country,

261
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,875
that you must define beauty
for black people.

262
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,352
- Okay!
- Now, that's Black Power.

263
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,638
Let me ask you something.
Is beauty defined

264
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,916
as someone
with a narrow nose?

265
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,597
- No!
- Thin lips?

266
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,080
No!

267
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
White skin?

268
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,720
Hell no!

269
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,110
- Hell no.
- Hell no!

270
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,376
'Cause you ain't got
none of that.

271
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,153
No. Okay.

272
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,910
Our lips are thick.

273
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,360
- Yes.
- Yes, they are!

274
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,153
Our noses broad.

275
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,232
- Our hair is nappy.
- Yes!

276
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,636
We are black,
and we are beautiful!

277
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,996
- Yes!
- Boom-shaka-laka!

278
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,596
You see,

279
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,631
we want to be so much
like the white people

280
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,552
who oppress us
in this country.

281
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,711
- Nope!
- And because they hate us,

282
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,918
and because we are ashamed
of our African heritage,

283
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,957
we then hate ourselves.

284
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,190
Preach.

285
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,075
Y'all don't hear me tonight.

286
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,799
We hear you.

287
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,109
Y'all dig Tarzan?

288
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,400
Tarzan. I'm gonna be honest.

289
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,193
When I was a boy, I used to go
to the Saturday matinees

290
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,714
and watch Tarzan
all the time.

291
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,559
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

292
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,633
And white Tarzan used to
beat up the black natives.

293
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,956
And I would sit there,
yelling, "Kill the beasts!

294
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,434
"Kill the savages.

295
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,554
"Kill them.

296
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,712
"Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them!"

297
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,793
But what I was saying
was, "Kill me."

298
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,320
That's right.

299
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,320
It was as if a young Jewish boy
saw Nazis

300
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,551
taking Jews off
to concentration camps

301
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,393
and cheered them on.

302
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,235
Today, I want those chiefs
to beat the hell out of Tarzan

303
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,834
and send his lily-white ass

304
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,991
on back to the caves of Europe.

305
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,194
Boom-shaka-laka!
- Right on.

306
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,075
Right on.

307
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,436
But it takes time.

308
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,873
It takes time to become
free of the lies

309
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,475
and their shaming effects
on the black mind.

310
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,153
- Okay.
- It takes time to reject

311
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,594
the most important lie,

312
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,433
that black people can't do
the same things

313
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,910
- that white people do...
- That's a lie.

314
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,713
...unless a white person
helps them.

315
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Talk about it.

316
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,039
Black Power also means
that we must unite.

317
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,672
We must unite,
and we must organize

318
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,156
to form a base
to fight racism.

319
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,237
- Okay!
- Yes. Yes.

320
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,233
To fight our oppressors.

321
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,197
The vast majority of Negroes
around this country,

322
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,150
they live
in captive communities.

323
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,232
And they must endure
their oppression

324
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,920
and their conditions,
because and only because

325
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,317
- they are black and powerless.
- Educate. Educate.

326
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
And now...

327
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,912
Now we are being shot down
like dogs in the streets

328
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,714
by white racist cops.

329
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,200
<i>Speak the truth.</i>

330
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,078
<i>I said
we are being shot down</i>

331
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,391
<i>in the streets
by white racist cops!</i>

332
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,074
<i>Fuck the police.</i>

333
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,832
We can no longer endure

334
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,116
this kind of oppression
without retribution.

335
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Hell no!

336
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,590
No more.

337
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,955
That war in Vietnam,

338
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,470
it is not only illegal,
it is immoral.

339
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,558
- That's right.
- Talk about it.

340
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,472
And you know
what I tell them?

341
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,919
Hell no, we won't go!

342
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,920
Hell no, we won't go!

343
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,031
Hell no, we won't go!

344
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,715
We ain't going!

345
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,719
I'd rather see a brother

346
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,838
kill a white racist cop
than kill a Vietnamese.

347
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,840
<i>Me, too.</i>

348
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,033
<i>Because at least,</i>

349
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,795
if he kills a racist cop
he is doing it for a reason,

350
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,156
because they are
shooting black people...

351
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,696
- That's right.
- ...in the backs,

352
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,679
in these streets,
right here in this very country.

353
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,315
- They're killing us like dogs!
- Boom-shaka-laka!

354
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,675
Right here!

355
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,589
Right here!

356
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,199
I just want to leave you,
uh, in closing

357
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,520
'cause I know it's getting late
and y'all gotta go party.

358
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,994
I'm sorry, study.

359
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,520
We love you!

360
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,353
I just want to leave you,

361
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,830
sisters and brothers,
with these last words.

362
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,920
If I am not for myself,

363
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,755
who will be?

364
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,712
If I am for myself alone,
who am I?

365
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,399
- Right.
- Hear, hear.

366
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,949
- If not now, when?
- When?

367
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,077
And if not you, who?

368
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,839
Who? Who?

369
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,796
Who? Who?

370
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,879
We need an undying love
for black people, wherever we may be.

371
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,511
All power to all the people.

372
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,910
All power to all the people!

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,560
All power to all the people!

374
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,831
All power to all the people!

375
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,320
"All power to all the people."

376
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,914
Pretty powerful stuff.

377
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,240
Incredible words,
Brother Kwame.

378
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,336
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

379
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,680
Thank you, brother.
Appreciate it.

380
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,560
Brother...

381
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,994
I gotta ask you something.

382
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,799
Do you really think

383
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,873
war between the black race
and the white race is inevitable?

384
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,520
Let me tell you.
Arm yourself, brother.

385
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,831
Get ready,
'cause the revolution is coming.

386
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,472
Pick up a gun and arm yourself,
because trust me, it's coming.

387
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,040
- Thank you for coming tonight.
- God bless you.

388
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,040
You looked great
on that stage tonight.

389
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,312
- Thank you, my brother.
- All right.

390
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,496
I don't know what you have planned now,
but maybe I can buy you a drink?

391
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,000
Uh... I, uh...

392
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,640
I gotta make sure
Brother Kwame is all squared away...

393
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,797
- What?
- ...and he gets to his hotel safely.

394
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,635
I can dig it.

395
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,960
But, you know, um,
if it's not too late,

396
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,198
maybe I can meet you
at the Red Lantern?

397
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,470
You know where that is?

398
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,070
Mmm-hmm.

399
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,039
So I'll see you then.

400
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,960
Damn right. Yes. Cool.

401
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,073
<i>All power
to all the people.</i>

402
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,760
Hey. How you doing?

403
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,634
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

404
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,816
You won't believe
what happened.

405
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,936
What are you having?

406
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,758
Bro Pope,
7 and 7, please.

407
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,320
Pigs pulled us over.

408
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Say what?

409
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,391
I don't want to see nothing
but black asses and black elbows.

410
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,274
Spread 'em!

411
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,354
You that so-called big-shot
Panther nigger, aren't you?

412
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,870
I heard you was
in town, Stokely.

413
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,189
My name is Kwame Ture.

414
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,119
I don't give two shits
what your nigger name is!

415
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,273
Black bitch,
you get this Black Panther

416
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,558
out of Colorado Springs
before sunrise, you hear me?

417
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,792
- Or you'll all go to jail.
- We were born in jail.

418
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,796
Ooh.

419
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Don't touch me!

420
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,896
- Don't touch her!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

421
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,176
- Get your hands off of her!
- Get your white hands off!

422
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,536
Keep your hands off of her!
Come on, get your hands off of her!

423
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,597
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

424
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,313
- Wait!
- Let her go, man!

425
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,034
You see the officers' names?

426
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,914
I know I should have, but...

427
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,816
The whole thing
was so frightening,

428
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,876
I didn't.

429
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,076
Come on.

430
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,640
- Let's dance. Follow me.
- Mmm.

431
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,976
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

432
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,955
What?

433
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,355
No.

434
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,995
- Come on, you know it, you know it.
- Uh-huh.

435
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,589
What was the room like?

436
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,238
Folks were hanging
on every word.

437
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,074
Like a Baptist church
on Christmas Sunday morning.

438
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,118
- Huh.
- Mmm-hmm.

439
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,672
Sounds like he had them
pretty riled up.

440
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,394
But I don't think that means black folks were
ready to start the revolution, Chief.

441
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,630
What makes you say that?

442
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,598
Nobody in there
was talking about that.

443
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,913
That wasn't the vibe.
Everybody was cool.

444
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,920
Let me get this straight.

445
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,155
He told a room of black folk
to get ready for a race war.

446
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,709
That they were going to have to
arm themselves and kill cops.

447
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,519
I mean, what about that?

448
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,631
Yeah, he said that, but,
Chief, I think it was just talk, you know?

449
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,915
Rhetoric.

450
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,909
That's what I thought, too.

451
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,071
- Jimmy?
- Like my partner said.

452
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,230
All right, well, thank goodness
Carmichael has left Colorado Springs.

453
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,277
- Kwame Ture.
- What?

454
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,637
He changed his name
from Stokely Carmichael to Kwame Ture.

455
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,714
I don't care if he changed his name to
that draft dodger, Muhammad Ali.

456
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,640
All right? He's still dangerous.

457
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,399
- Did you hear the story Patrice told me?
- No, I didn't.

458
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,518
About how the CSPD
pulled over her and Ture?

459
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,069
Patrice, she's the one
from the Black Student Union,

460
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,879
the group
that brought in Ture?

461
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,480
Kwame Ture. Correct, sir.

462
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,960
Getting pretty chummy
with her, huh?

463
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,509
No, just doing my job, Chief. Undercover.

464
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,960
Let's just make sure it ain't
under the cover of the sheets.

465
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,071
I would never jeopardize
a case, sir.

466
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,480
He doesn't know
what he'd do.

467
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,276
You're new.

468
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,156
You guys sit tight.
Ron, come with me.

469
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,992
Ron, I'm transferring you
to Intelligence.

470
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,910
What will I be
doing there?

471
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,430
Intelligence.

472
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,359
Against my
better judgment.

473
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,150
Five, four,
three, two, one.

474
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,195
Swish!

475
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,955
Police department.

476
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,594
He is at lunch.

477
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,669
Excuse me? Yes, yes.

478
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,856
<i>You have reached</i>

479
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,873
<i>the Colorado Springs chapter

00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,519
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

481
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,910
<i>And God bless white America.</i>

482
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,674
Hello. This is
Ron Stallworth calling.

483
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,311
I saw your advertisement in
the <i>Colorado Springs Gazette.</i>

484
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,799
I'm interested in receiving
some reading materials from you.

485
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,480
My phone number is 103-9994.

486
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,793
I'm very much looking forward
to you returning my call.

487
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,520
- Yeah, who's this?
- Ron Stallworth here.

488
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,831
This is Walter
returning your call.

489
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,995
From the Organization.

490
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,554
The Organization?

491
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,756
<i>That's right.</i>

492
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,194
We appreciate your interest.

493
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,276
What's your story?

494
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,999
Well, since you asked...

495
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,873
Since you asked,
I hate niggers.

496
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,797
- I hate Jews.
- Huh?

497
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,794
Spics and Micks.

498
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,999
Dagos and Chinks.

499
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,073
But my mouth to God's ears,
I really hate those nigger rats.

500
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,479
And anyone else, really,
that doesn't have

501
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,836
pure white Aryan blood
running through their veins.

502
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,396
<i>My sister, Pamela,</i>

503
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,712
<i>she was just recently accosted
by one of those black coons.</i>

504
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,916
Is that so?

505
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,036
Yeah.

506
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,677
Every time I think about
that black baboon

507
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,114
putting his filthy black hands

508
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,510
on her
pure-as-white-driven-snow body...

509
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,434
I mean pure, Walter.
She's a saint. She's an angel.

510
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,000
It makes me want to puke.

511
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,160
You are just the kind of guy
that we are looking for.

512
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,315
Listen, uh, when can you meet?

513
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,120
How about Friday night
after I get off work?

514
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,316
That's a deal, buddy boy.

515
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,896
We'll get right back to you
with the details.

516
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,070
Take care, now.

517
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,117
God bless white America.

518
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,517
Did I just hear you use
your real name?

519
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,230
Oh, motherfucker.

520
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,631
Yeah, motherfucker amateur hour.

521
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,256
That's your real name,
right? Isn't...

522
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,136
Isn't it Ron Stallworth?
Right, isn't that his real name?

523
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,296
Can't believe
he just said that.

524
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,516
Well, good luck, Ron,
with your new redneck friends.

525
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,839
They want you
to join the Klan?

526
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,434
They want to meet me first.

527
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,073
- They want to meet you?
- Mmm-hmm.

528
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,153
Yeah, well, you probably
shouldn't go to that meeting.

529
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,469
Good call, Sarge.

530
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,040
So you're a crazy
son of a bitch, huh?

531
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,110
We'd have to go
to Narcotics,

532
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,317
meaning we'd have to deal
with Chief Bridges.

533
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,437
Yeah, I can't spare the men.

534
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,718
Well, I've looked over the logs,
Chief, and it seems you can spare them.

535
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,634
Sergeant Trapp,
Ron spoke to the man on the phone.

536
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,589
All right, when they hear
the voice of one of my guys,

537
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
they're gonna know
the difference.

538
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,270
How so, Chief?

539
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,914
You want me
to spell it out for you?

540
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,919
They're going to know
the difference

541
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,710
between how a white man
talks and a Negro.

542
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,519
How exactly does
a black man talk?

543
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,755
Okay, Ron, what I think
the Chief is trying to say...

544
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,496
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak for myself.

545
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,795
- Thank you, Sarge.
- Sure.

546
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,096
You know what
I'm trying to say.

547
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,776
Chief, some of us
can speak King's English.

548
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,029
Others speak jive.

549
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,639
Ron Stallworth here
happens to be fluent in both.

550
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,510
Okay, Ron, how do you propose
to make this investigation?

551
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,758
Well, I've established contact
and created some familiarity

552
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,672
with the Klansman
over the phone.

553
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,976
I'll continue in that role,
but I'll need another officer,

554
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,196
surprise, surprise,
a white officer,

555
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,511
to play me when they meet
face-to-face.

556
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,319
See, that's my point exactly.

557
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,517
Chief, black Ron Stallworth
over the phone,

558
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,000
white Ron Stallworth
face-to-face,

559
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,993
so there becomes
a combined Ron Stallworth.

560
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,151
- Can you do that?
- I believe we can.

561
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,000
With the right white man,
we can do anything.

562
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,269
Anything happens
to one of my men,

563
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,511
there won't be
two Ron Stallworths.

564
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,954
There'll be none.

565
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
You're late.

566
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,000
Sorry. It'll never
happen again.

567
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,838
Seems like I heard
that one before.

568
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,760
Jimmy, when's the last time
they let a rookie lead an investigation?

569
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,200
Oh, that's right... Never.

570
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,016
Okay, all right, let's move on.

571
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,633
Let's, uh...
Let's go to our bio.

572
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,398
Okay. Ron Stallworth.
I do wholesale manufacturing.

573
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,073
- Whereabout?
- Pueblo.

574
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,550
- What's that commute like?
- Jimmy, I'm glad you asked.

575
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,233
It's a straight shot
down I-25.

576
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,834
- Hour, tops.
- It's a long ride.

577
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,990
What do we listen to?

578
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,430
KWYD, Christian talk
in the morning,

579
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,910
although the signal starts
to cut out near Pueblo.

580
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,078
On the way back,
I like to turn it to 102.7

581
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,560
to get my
Allman Brothers fix.

582
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,280
Only I have to change it
every time that British fag,

583
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,555
David Bowie, pipes on.

584
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,279
Whoa! I love Bowie.

585
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,400
I mean, who
doesn't, right?

586
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,870
Remember,
you have to retain

587
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,952
all the information
you share with these guys

588
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,872
so I can be
white Ron Stallworth.

589
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,917
Jimmy, I always
wanted to be black.

590
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,714
All my heroes
were black guys.

591
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,350
Willie Mays.

592
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,672
- Basket catch.
- Wilt the Stilt.

593
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,353
Record 100 points
in one game.

594
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,760
But you know
my absolute favorite?

595
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,469
O.J.

596
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,994
Heisman pose!

597
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,800
- The Juice!
- I love fucking O.J.

598
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,475
Orenthal James Simpson.

599
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,360
- Bet you didn't know that.
- Of course I did.

600
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,909
We as a Negro people
appreciate your love,

601
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,536
but don't share that love
with these guys.

602
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,517
For you, it's the fucking
Osmonds, right?

603
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,319
Hey, I love Marie Osmond.

604
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,960
I get to play you,
but you don't get to play me?

605
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,713
- Jimmy, does that sound fair?
- Fair?

606
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,936
- Not to me.
- Now, what else?

607
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,840
- Who are you meeting with?
- Walter Breachway.

608
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,276
Become his friend.
Let's get invited back.

609
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,589
Well, look at you.

610
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,114
Okay. Anything else, sir?

611
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,999
I'm on the phone
with the Klan.

612
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,673
You meet
with them in person.

613
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
And?

614
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,831
And you need to try
and sound like my voice.

615
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,236
Oh, boy.

616
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,916
All right. Here.

617
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,472
- Me, too?
- Yeah. You, too, Jimmy.

618
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,074
- Godfather.
- That's right.

619
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,840
You wanted to be black,
here's your chance.

620
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,840
Lookie here.

621
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,316
Some people say
we've got a lot of malice.

622
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,674
Some say it's a lot of nerve.

623
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,510
Lookie here.

624
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,513
Some people say we got a lot of malice.

625
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,398
- Some...
- Come on, come on.

626
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,199
This is life and death here.
Come on.

627
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,430
- Oh, is it?
- Come on.

628
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,358
Some say it's a lot
of nerve. Nerve!

629
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,796
- You want me to do this now?
- Please, now.

630
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,473
For all our sakes,
do it now, please.

631
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,434
Some say it's
a lot of nerve.

632
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,874
Let it flow, though.
Let it flow.

633
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
- I'm flowing.
- Okay.

634
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,919
I say we won't quit moving
till we get what we deserve.

635
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,798
I say we won't quit moving

636
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,594
until we get
what we deserve.

637
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,717
We've been buked,
and we've been scorned.

638
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,757
- We've been buke...
- "Buked." Say that.

639
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,832
- What does "buked" mean?
- Disrespected.

640
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,274
You've been
disrespected, Flip.

641
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,232
- You.
- Why doesn't he just say that?

642
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,993
We've been buked,
and we've been scorned.

643
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,639
This has got to flow,
from the...

644
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,916
We've been treated bad,
talked about.

645
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,239
We've been buked.
We've been scorned.

646
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,976
- All right, get that shit out.
- We've been treated bad, talked about.

647
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,792
Just as sure as you're born,
but just as sure as it take.

648
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,031
Two eyes
to make a pair. Huh!

649
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,870
- Two eyes to make a pair.
- Huh!

650
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,396
Hah!

651
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,880
- Hah!
- Hah!

652
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,110
- Hah!
- Huh!

653
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,680
- Hah!
- Brother, we can't quit till we get our share.

654
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,355
Brother, we can't quit
till we get our share.

655
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,238
Doesn't make grammatical sense,
but okay.

656
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,471
Say it loud. I'm black,
and I'm proud.

657
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,880
Say it for O.J., Jimmy.
You, too.

658
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,640
Say it loud.
I'm black, and I'm proud.

659
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,713
Say it loud.
I'm black, and I'm proud.

660
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,194
That's right. There it is.

661
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,430
I believed you.

662
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,157
Lose that Jewish necklace
around your neck.

663
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,350
Jimmy, it's not a Jewish necklace.
It's a Star of David.

664
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,470
Okay.

665
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,239
Flip, you're Jewish?

666
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,595
I don't know. Am I?

667
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,520
Ron Stallworth?

668
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,790
That's me.

669
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,676
- You must be Walter.
- Name's Felix.

670
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,536
Well, I was told I'd be meeting
a Walter Breachway.

671
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,835
Change of plans, Mac.

672
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,640
<i>I'm gonna need you
to hop in the truck.</i>

673
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,096
Okay, well, how about
I just follow you in my...

674
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,190
No can do.

675
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,396
You come with me.

676
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,636
Security.

677
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,560
<i>I'll drive you back.</i>

678
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,595
Come on, let's roll.

679
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,274
You for the white race, Ron?

680
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,595
Oh, hell yeah.

681
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,080
Been having trouble lately
with these local niggers.

682
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,036
Ugh. Since the Civil War,
it's always trouble with niggers.

683
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,190
Uh-huh.

684
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,519
Walter said something
about your sister.

685
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,750
Makes me sick.

686
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,600
What are they saying?
They saying where they're going?

687
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,552
But it's also,
you know, camaraderie,

688
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,313
I'm looking for
with the Klan.

689
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,914
What the fuck
did you say?

690
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,992
- Camaraderie?
- No, the other word.

691
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,918
- The Klan?
- Not "the Klan."

692
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,919
It's "the Organization."

693
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,676
The Invisible Empire has managed to stay
invisible for a reason.

694
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,997
Do not ever
use that word.

695
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,270
You understand?

696
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,800
Hey, I over-stand.

697
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,109
Right. You got it.

698
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,350
The Organization.

699
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,076
Check this shit out.
You're never gonna believe this.

700
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,276
What?

701
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,352
A fucking jig
on our bumper.

702
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,273
- Ron, he sees us. Back off.
- Damn!

703
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,917
Let's get ready.
Look under your seat.

704
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,555
- Yeah.
- What?

705
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,750
Pull it out.

706
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,310
Load 'er up.

707
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,999
Put two in the chamber.

708
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,514
Come on, load it up.

709
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,989
Come on, load it.

710
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,674
Don't be messing with us.

711
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,911
The Organization.

712
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,480
Not so fast, buddy boy.

713
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,080
Hold your horses.

714
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,909
Mmm!

715
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,400
Ron, glad you
could make it.

716
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,994
Walter Breachway,
chapter president.

717
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,976
Ron Stallworth.
I appreciate you inviting me out.

718
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,232
Absolutely. I've been impressed with our
conversations over the phone.

719
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,776
I think you have a lot of fine ideas that
could really help the cause.

720
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,040
Well, I meant
every word I said.

721
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,551
You know, I've had my own share
of run-ins with niggers.

722
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,799
Matter of fact, it's what
led me to the Organization.

723
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,151
- Is that right?
- It's become my salvation.

724
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,350
See, I was, uh,

725
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,390
shot and wounded
by a couple niggers.

726
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,431
Then my wife was savagely raped
by a whole pack of 'em.

727
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,590
- God.
- That's right,

728
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,473
- and not a one of them went to jail.
- Huh.

729
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,515
Tell you what.

730
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,474
They're taking over.

731
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,878
Hell, it's all you see
on TV anymore.

732
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,076
Niggers selling soap.

733
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,240
Niggers selling toothpaste.

734
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,470
Niggers selling
automobiles.

735
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,075
Everywhere you look,
it's niggers, niggers, niggers.

736
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,437
Yeah, wasn't long ago
them sum bitches wasn't on no TV.

737
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,989
You're forgetting about
Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima.

738
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,594
Oh! Dang.

739
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,951
I kind of like them niggers.

740
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,875
Rice and pancakes.

741
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,078
Hey, uh, my name's Ivanhoe,
by the way.

742
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,230
Hey. Ron.

743
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,000
Hey, all you get now is how we gotta
cater to them.

744
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,919
Now, watch your mouth. Yeah.

745
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,271
Don't say this.
Don't say that.

746
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,635
Be nice.

747
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,200
Hell, they ain't even
colored no more.

748
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,794
Negroes. Blacks.

749
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,190
- Afro-Americans now.
- Yeah, fuck it.

750
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,920
Just call them fucking niggers.
Make it fucking simple.

751
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,476
- Niggers.
- Niggers.

752
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,676
That's the right idea.

753
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,240
I've been saying
this stuff for years.

754
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,440
Well, you ain't
the only one.

755
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,000
It's good to know
someone else gets it.

756
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,160
So, what kind of stuff
you guys do?

757
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,874
What kind of stuff we do?

758
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,555
We, uh... Cross burnings

759
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,270
and marches and stuff
so people don't fuck with us.

760
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,795
I'm tired of niggers
fucking with me.

761
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,473
Well, then you come
to the right place.

762
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,074
Nobody fucks with us.

763
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,557
Now, how much you know
about the history?

764
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,599
Some. I could know more.

765
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,990
We will teach you.

766
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,800
Yeah, this is fixing
to be a big year for us.

767
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,950
How so?

768
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,520
- Boom!
- All right.

769
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,896
We're gonna make
fireworks, aren't we?

770
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,656
All right, all right, Ivanhoe,
shut your dumb mouth.

771
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,512
Ivan, shut the fuck up.

772
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,159
- Burnt ends.
- All right, all right.

773
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,959
That's enough.
Shut your dumb mouth.

774
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,759
Sorry about him.
He drinks too much.

775
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,194
Doesn't know
what he's saying.

776
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,638
Just to be clear,
the, uh...

777
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,598
The Organization
is strictly nonviolent.

778
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,559
Oh, nonviolent
like that nigger,

779
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,632
that dead nigger,
Martin Luther Coon.

780
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,997
- Yeah, gotcha.
- Ron? You mind coming with me?

781
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,355
Yeah, where to?

782
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,760
You undercover
or something?

783
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,916
- You ask too many questions.
- All right.

784
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,200
Be friendly, now.

785
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,272
This is family.
All right?

786
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,674
Let's go.

787
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,956
Congrats. You passed
the mustard.

788
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,750
How about we go and get that
membership process started?

789
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,633
- That's it?
- That's it.

790
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,160
Uh, have a seat.

791
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,709
Go ahead and, uh,
fill these out.

792
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,757
Send 'em to
the national headquarters.

793
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,600
Now, once they send you
your membership card,

794
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,111
you'll be able to participate
in all our programs.

795
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,680
Alcoa can't wait.

796
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,957
I love those commercials.

797
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,872
Imperial tax
to become a member,

798
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,872
$10 for the year,
$15 chapter fee.

799
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,634
Robes and hoods are not
included. That's extra.

800
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,234
Fucking inflation.

801
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,074
I can't thank you brothers enough.
This means a lot to me.

802
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,475
Pleasure's all ours.

803
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,200
You're not a Jew, right?
Jews killed Christ.

804
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,192
Are you trying
to offend me?

805
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,475
Protocol.

806
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,954
Course I'm no stinkin' kike.

807
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,271
All right, look,
we gotta ask it, is all.

808
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,114
But he's not a Jew,
all right? Satisfied?

809
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,112
Smells kosher to me.

810
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,317
- Stop fucking around.
- I fuck straight.

811
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,816
- Who you fucking?
- Double D!

812
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,216
All right, both of you,
give the man some space.

813
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,550
Jesus Christ.
Let him breathe a little.

814
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,835
Ron, let me
buy you a beer.

815
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,920
- Okay.
- Come on.

816
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,760
Sorry about these guys.
They're a little, uh,

817
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,990
too friendly sometimes.

818
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,400
They just get excited.

819
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
Yeah.

820
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,440
- What kind of beer you like?
- Coors, if you got it.

821
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,515
That was interesting.

822
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,998
Not exactly
the Beverly Hillbillies.

823
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,680
They liked you.

824
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,433
Except for that Felix guy.

825
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,273
Do not ride
his bumper like that.

826
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,590
Two car lengths.

827
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,319
You think he got
a good look at my face?

828
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,550
Probably.

829
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,594
You get the papers?

830
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,720
They want you to join.

831
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,553
Technically,
they want you to join.

832
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Yeah.

833
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,920
Yeah, they want a black man
to join the Ku Klux Klan.

834
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,354
I'd say that's
mission impossible.

835
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,749
Double success.

836
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,996
We're in!

837
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,351
Slow down, brother.
Slow down.

838
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,351
And exactly how much
should we be worried about them?

839
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,552
Enough that we'd like
to dig deeper.

840
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,235
One of the men discussed plans
for a possible attack, so...

841
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,518
I wouldn't give him that much credit.
These guys like to boast.

842
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,876
What kind of attack?

843
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,270
Uh, Ivan...

844
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,917
Ivanhoe said "boom," mentioned
something about fireworks.

845
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,216
But personally, I didn't buy it.
I doubt they're even capable.

846
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,233
Either way, at this point,
we're looking for full support

847
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,754
from the department
on this, Sarge.

848
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,479
Let's move on with
the investigation.

849
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,916
Let's try to find out
if they are capable of anything.

850
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,559
Okay.

851
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,200
- Thank you, Sarge.
- You got it.

852
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,153
When we dropped Brother Kwame
off at the airport,

853
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,918
he told me that
the Black Power movement

854
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,992
needed strong sisters like me
to lead the fight

855
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,753
against capitalist oppression

856
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,309
and the politicians and pigs
who perpetuate it.

857
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,470
His words almost made
that whole pig nightmare worthwhile.

858
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,716
What's wrong?

859
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,596
What do you mean?

860
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,760
What's wrong?

861
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,234
I don't really
use that word.

862
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,909
What word?

863
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
"Pigs."

864
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,120
Well, what else
would you call them?

865
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,395
Cops.

866
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,754
Police.

867
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,190
Officers.

868
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,919
A bunch of racist cops
on a power trip.

869
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,639
So, you think all cops
are racist?

870
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,311
It only takes one to pull a trigger
on an innocent sister or brother.

871
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,916
Hmm.

872
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,513
Why were you at
Brother Kwame's speech?

873
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,875
He's got some good ideas.

874
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,998
I don't agree with all of them,
but he's a smart brother,

875
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,400
definitely worth hearing.

876
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,911
Are you down
for the liberation of black people?

877
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,832
Do we always have
to talk politics?

878
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,434
What's more important?

879
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,994
Do you ever
take time off?

880
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,549
No. It's a lifetime job.

881
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,236
Sister Angela Davis,
most righteous sister,

882
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,630
can we please spend
some quality time together?

883
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,996
And what did you say
your J-O-B is?

884
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,719
Sister Kathleen Cleaver,
I didn't.

885
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Are you a pig?

886
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,116
Excuse me?

887
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,590
Are you a pig?

888
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,350
You mean a cop?

889
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,556
Are you a cop?

890
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,836
No.

891
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,076
I'm in construction.

892
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,999
But more importantly,
I'm a black man

893
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,718
who wants to get
to know a strong,

894
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,800
intelligent,
beautiful sister.

895
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,956
The very one
I'm looking at right now.

896
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
You dig?

897
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,994
Sure enough.

898
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,896
That's what I'm talking about.
Power to the people.

899
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,593
All power
to all the people.

900
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,797
- That's right, sister.
- Right on, right on.

901
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,279
- This is Walter.
- Ron here.

902
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,960
This is Ron?

903
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,679
Sorry, your voice sounds
different over the phone.

904
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,240
Uh...

905
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,630
My allergies...
Allergies acting up again.

906
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,319
I get those all the time.

907
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,279
Listen, wanted to tell you

908
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,896
that it was a real pleasure
to have you swing by.

909
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,840
I think the brothers
really took a liking to you.

910
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,956
I'm honored.

911
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,056
If you're free Saturday,
why don't you swing by Felix's.

912
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,912
You can meet the rest
of the brotherhood. Hmm?

913
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,230
Sounds good to me.

914
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,640
Well, I will see you then.

915
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,149
I've got a friend.

916
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,312
He, uh, keeps up
with these groups.

917
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,112
He says they're moving away
from the old violent, racist style.

918
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,556
So, that's what Duke
is peddling now.

919
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,518
It's, uh,
becoming mainstream.

920
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,873
- Duke?
- David Duke.

921
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,277
Current grand wizard
of the Klan.

922
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,999
But he's always
in a three-piece suit,

923
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,959
never seen in a hood
or robe in public,

924
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,350
and he now goes
by "national director."

925
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,269
So he's clearly got
his sights on higher office.

926
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,714
- Politics? How so?
- Yeah.

927
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,792
Think it's another way
to sell hate.

928
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,600
- Keep going.
- Think about it.

929
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,071
Affirmative action,
immigration, crime, tax reform.

930
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,196
Mmm.

931
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,079
He says no one wants
to be called a bigot anymore.

932
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,231
I guess Archie Bunker
made that too uncool.

933
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,392
So the idea is,
under all these issues,

934
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,996
everyday Americans
can accept it,

935
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,230
support it,
until eventually, one day,

936
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,029
he gets somebody
in the White House that embodies it.

937
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,036
Sarge...

938
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,640
Come on.

939
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,992
America would never elect
somebody like David Duke

940
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,796
president of
the United States of America.

941
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,830
Coming from a black man,
that's pretty naive.

942
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,994
Why don't you wake up?

943
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,312
Ron, hi. I'm Connie, Felix's wife.
It's so nice to meet you.

944
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,790
Oh.

945
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,039
- Want to come right in?
- Sure.

946
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,376
- Do you mind if I, uh, smoke in there?
- Oh, not at all.

947
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,960
I'm telling you,
a war's a-coming.

948
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,216
That'll be the end
of the purified white race

949
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,736
- as we know it.
- They're right inside.

950
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,976
Just make yourself
right at home.

951
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,639
<i>It's time we go
on the offensive.</i>

952
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,629
- We gotta make sure that everybody...
- Hey, man.

953
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,677
- Hello. Hey, fellas.
- Welcome. Welcome.

954
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,114
This is Ron, everybody.

955
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,600
- Mr. Stallworth.
- All right.

956
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,976
- That's Mike.
- Hey, Mike. How are you? Ron.

957
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,176
- Scott in the back.
- Ron. How are you.

958
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,400
- Jesup.
- Hey. How are you?

959
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,296
- Ron, why don't you have a seat.
- Sorry to interrupt,

960
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,198
but I brought
some cheese dip and crackers.

961
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,350
Would you like some?

962
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,680
- Thanks, honey.
- Thank you.

963
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,997
- Walter?
- Make them remember

964
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,874
who we are
and what we stand for.

965
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,271
We are the Organization.

966
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,880
- We have to...
- Oh! Oh! Oh! I read something in the <i>Gazette</i>

967
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,997
that this nigger
named Carmichael held a rally

968
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,639
and that some
college nigger girl

969
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,270
from the Baboon Student Union
was attacking our police.

970
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,874
I mean, this girl
is dangerous.

971
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,713
She's like that Commie,
Angela Davis.

972
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,315
And I just...
I think we should shut her mouth.

973
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,909
Here.

974
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,120
I cut the article.

975
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,675
That'll be all.

976
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,594
Love you, sweetie.

977
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,160
Someday,

978
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,357
you're going to need me
to do something for you.

979
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,590
Just wait and see.

980
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,560
And I will be
right in here.

981
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,914
Why don't we, uh, get back
to our bread and butter.

982
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,639
Let's talk about
the next cross burning,

983
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,416
which, Ron, you'll be lucky
enough to attend

984
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,720
if your membership
comes in time.

985
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,856
It'll be a tremendous honor.

986
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,536
- The highest hills get the most eyes.
- Yeah.

987
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,914
Prove you can read.

988
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,920
"Friday night last week,

989
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,310
"the Colorado College
Black Student Union..."

990
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,754
Hey, Ron.

991
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,195
I gotta show you something.

992
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,557
"...hosted a controversial talk
featuring Stokely Carmichael

993
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,439
"at Bell's Nightingale
nightclub."

994
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,438
"Black Student Union."

995
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,989
"Black Student..."
That go together to you?

996
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,639
That sounds
fucking weird to me.

997
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,314
Lookie here.

998
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,480
Wow. This is
really something.

999
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,753
Here's my favorite.

1000
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,834
12-gauge.

1001
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,874
I call this the Jew Killer.

1002
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,952
<i>I call it
a Remington Model 1900.</i>

1003
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,150
<i>Indeed, it is.</i>

1004
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,520
Okay.

1005
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,069
We about done here?
We got a few more items on the...

1006
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,435
Not just yet.

1007
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,753
Gotta make sure
there's no Jew in him.

1008
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,520
All right, now you're just
being offensive.

1009
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,473
Okay? We're talking
about someone

1010
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,313
who's gonna be our brother
in a few months.

1011
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,000
You see a Star of David
around his neck?

1012
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,872
Is there a yarmulke
on Ron's head?

1013
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,440
Just protocol.

1014
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,679
My house, my rules.

1015
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,636
This way.

1016
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,953
Where we going now?

1017
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,512
<i>I gotta
show you something.</i>

1018
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,119
Tough titty.

1019
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,515
It's not necessary, Felix.

1020
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,273
This is how
we lose recruits.

1021
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,670
You are going to take
this lie detector test.

1022
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,720
- Take a seat.
- What is this?

1023
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,200
Is this your Jew den?

1024
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,033
Is this where you make
your candles,

1025
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,998
you know,
and your lampshades?

1026
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,356
No, you're gonna take
this lie detector test.

1027
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,159
Open the damn door.

1028
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,760
This is some lame bullshit.

1029
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,436
Lame or not, you're taking
this Jew lie detector test.

1030
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,518
- Sit down.
- Okay, Felix.

1031
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,319
Out of respect
for this Organization,

1032
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,416
I'll play along with your
little <i>Get Smart</i> bullshit,

1033
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,794
but I'm no fucking Jew.

1034
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,320
Sit down.

1035
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,200
Ask anybody.

1036
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,116
They'll say
I'm a real friendly guy.

1037
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,151
Thing is, I'm only friendly
to my friends.

1038
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,397
Not Jew friendly.

1039
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,953
Damn sure
not nigger friendly.

1040
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,918
- Me, neither.
- Know what I think?

1041
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,196
- You think?
- Oh, yeah, I think.

1042
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,316
What do you think about?

1043
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,596
This Holocaust stuff

1044
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,510
never happened.

1045
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,519
That's the biggest Jewish
conspiracy ever.

1046
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,034
Eight million Jews killed?
Concentration camps?

1047
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,079
Never happened.

1048
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,151
- Where's the proof?
- Are you high?

1049
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,674
I don't get high.

1050
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,634
I drink.

1051
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,840
'Cause I'd say the Holocaust

1052
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,151
is one of the most beautiful
things I've ever seen.

1053
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,034
It just makes sense to me.

1054
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,552
You have a whole race
of leeches

1055
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,274
that you have to get rid of.

1056
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,792
So, what do you do? You starve them,
you burn them, you get rid of them.

1057
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,951
It's like weeding out roots
for the better people.

1058
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,515
- Haven't you seen the footage?
- That's fake.

1059
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,713
Jews run Hollywood.

1060
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,036
Fucking hell.

1061
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,349
Let me see your dick.

1062
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,512
<i>You gonna shoot me?
Put that gun away.</i>

1063
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,592
I hear you Jews do something
funny with your dicks.

1064
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,319
Some weird Jew shit.

1065
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,239
- Is your dick circumstanced?
- Oh, is that what this is about?

1066
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,040
You're trying to see my big Jew dick,
you fucking faggot.

1067
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,150
Who you calling a fucking faggot,
Jew faggot?

1068
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,319
Now, put that fucking strap
on your arm.

1069
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,559
Put it on your arm!

1070
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,793
Oh!

1071
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,440
- Felix!
- Connie, what's wrong?

1072
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,273
Felix! Felix!

1073
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,795
- Connie! Connie, what's wrong?
- Felix! Felix!

1074
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,496
- Connie!
- There's a black lawn jockey

1075
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,954
on our green lawn!

1076
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,351
- Felix!
- I'm coming to you, honey!

1077
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,352
- Shit, shit.
- Felix!

1078
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,553
Kill that son of a bitch!

1079
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,870
Yeah, keep driving,
you black spear chucker,

1080
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,111
- piece of shit nigger!
- That son of a bitch!

1081
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,759
Fucked up
the window, man.

1082
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,600
Still want me to take
your Jew detector test?

1083
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,313
Everybody back
in the house!

1084
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,194
Back in the house now!

1085
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,318
- Shit.
- Connie, you okay?

1086
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,237
- You okay? Back in the house.
- That's why we gotta get stronger.

1087
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,030
- That's some bullshit!
- Back in the house, honey.

1088
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,856
That's what
I've been telling all you boys.

1089
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,959
We need more guns!

1090
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,360
<i>Lie detector?</i>

1091
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,630
Shots fired?

1092
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,439
You fucking kidding me?

1093
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,111
It's a goddamn clusterfuck.

1094
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,432
You dickheads
are fucking with me.

1095
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,955
You're jerking my chain.
You're jerking my chain.

1096
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,112
I'm getting a reach-around from the Chief.
It's a big fucking circle jerk!

1097
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,554
- That's funny?
- No, sir.

1098
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,154
'Cause if Bridges
hears about this,

1099
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,376
this whole fucking operation's
going to be closed down.

1100
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,516
Yeah, that's funny.

1101
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,717
And I'm going to be
a fucking school crossing guard

1102
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,469
in fucking the ghetto
of Five Points!

1103
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,472
I mean, is he gonna
hear about it, Sarge?

1104
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,800
Cocksuckers.

1105
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,430
Hear about what?

1106
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,840
Hey, guys.

1107
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,877
Charles, can you
give us five, please?

1108
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Sure.

1109
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,600
I didn't want to say it with Trapp,
but that peckerwood had a gun in my face,

1110
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,039
and he was an ass hair away
from pulling the trigger.

1111
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,873
- And he didn't.
- But he could have.

1112
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,639
And then I would
have been dead.

1113
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,434
For what?

1114
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,911
Stopping some jerk-offs
from playing dress-up?

1115
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,191
- Flip, it's intel.
- Well, I'm not risking my life

1116
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,760
to prevent some rednecks
from lighting a couple sticks on fire.

1117
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,076
This is the job.
What's your problem?

1118
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,356
That's my problem.
For you, it's a crusade.

1119
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,280
- Mmm-hmm.
- For me, it's a job.

1120
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,120
It's not personal,
nor should it be.

1121
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,376
Why haven't you
bought into this?

1122
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,040
- Why should I?
- Because you're Jewish, brother.

1123
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,591
The so-called chosen people.

1124
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,478
You've been passing
for a WASP.

1125
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,516
White Anglo-Saxon Protestant,
cherry pie, hot dog, white boy.

1126
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,830
Hmm.

1127
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,536
It's what some
light-skinned black folks do.

1128
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,880
They pass for white.

1129
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,216
Doesn't that hatred
you've been hearing the Klan say,

1130
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,515
doesn't that piss you off?

1131
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,336
- 'Course it does.
- Then why you acting like

1132
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,816
you ain't got skin
in the game, brother?

1133
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,480
Rookie, that's
my fucking business.

1134
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,960
It's our business.

1135
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,551
Now, I'm going to get you
your membership card

1136
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,279
so you can go
to the cross burning

1137
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,511
- and get in deeper with these guys.
- Okay.

1138
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,717
Right, partner?

1139
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,031
<i>Wake up, white man.
The Negro wants your</i>

1140
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,376
<i>- white woman and your job.</i>
- Sorry. I'm sorry. Let me...

1141
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,517
<i>The Jew wants your money,
and this you...</i>

1142
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,634
Sorry, who am I talking to?

1143
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,713
This is Ron Stallworth calling
from Colorado Springs, Colorado.

1144
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,950
How are you today, sir?

1145
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,350
I'm quite well. Thank you.
Uh, what can I do you for?

1146
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,150
<i>I desperately want to participate
in my chapter's honorary events,</i>

1147
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,311
but I can't until I receive
my membership card.

1148
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,240
Of course that's something
I can help you with.

1149
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,272
Great. Um, who am
I speaking with?

1150
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,636
This is David Duke.

1151
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,912
Did you just say your name
was David Duke?

1152
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,360
Last time I checked.

1153
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,559
Grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan?
That David Duke?

1154
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,400
Yes, that grand wizard
and national director, yeah.

1155
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,478
National director, too, huh?

1156
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,558
<i>Yes, you're darn tooting.</i>

1157
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,836
That's amazing.

1158
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,671
<i>I'm honored to be speaking
with you, sir.</i>

1159
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,880
<i>I'm not afraid to say it.</i>

1160
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,909
<i>I consider you
a true white American hero.</i>

1161
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,799
Is there any other kind?

1162
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,235
No, sir.

1163
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,114
<i>I'm just happy to be talking
to a true white American.</i>

1164
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,796
Amen.

1165
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,915
It seems like there's less
and less of us out there these days.

1166
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,400
- Mmm.
<i>- Mmm</i>.

1167
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,597
<i>Now, about that
membership card...</i>

1168
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,197
Yeah, Ron,
I understand the situation.

1169
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,749
Uh, we've had some
administrative problems here.

1170
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,514
It's caused a little bit
of a backlog.

1171
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,757
Tell you what,
I'm gonna see to it personally

1172
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,752
that your membership card
is processed,

1173
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,514
approved and sent out today.
How's that sound?

1174
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,796
Thank you, sir.

1175
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,236
I can't express to you
how much this means to me.

1176
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,352
Ron, please.
Pleasure's all mine.

1177
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,919
I look forward to hopefully meeting you
in person one day, and, uh...

1178
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,200
Well, God bless white America.

1179
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,240
- God bless white America, sir.
- Okay, take care.

1180
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,956
Excuse me.

1181
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,714
Watch where you're going.

1182
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,360
You could get hurt
like that, hot shot.

1183
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,355
The cop that pulled
Kwame Ture over that night,

1184
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,389
was it Landers?

1185
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,950
How'd you know?

1186
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,918
I can smell them
a mile away now.

1187
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,593
What, do you got
Smell-O-Vision?

1188
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,758
He's been a bad cop
for a long time.

1189
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,513
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1190
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,638
Few years ago,
he shot and killed a black kid.

1191
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,315
- Jesus.
- He said he had a gun,

1192
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,518
but he wasn't that type.

1193
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,440
Why do you guys
tolerate this?

1194
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,456
You want to be the guy
that rats him out?

1195
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,312
You want to go
to Landers' office now?

1196
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,519
'Cause we're a family.

1197
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,717
And right or wrong,
we stick together.

1198
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,837
That reminds me
of another group.

1199
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,278
That's a bull's-eye, Ron.

1200
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,194
You guys heard about
this Hide N Seek room?

1201
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,718
Here, you got a decent bar

1202
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,111
turned into
a filthy fag bar overnight.

1203
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,556
Fucking fags everywhere
these days.

1204
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,640
They're trying to colonize.

1205
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,871
You know, first they get
their own bars,

1206
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,918
then they want
equal treatment.

1207
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,079
Forget those fags.

1208
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,789
Those guys Army-trained?

1209
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,030
A lot of us are, yeah.

1210
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,714
Fort Carson myself.

1211
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,760
- God, I wish I had a scope on this thing.
- Never seen those Macs before.

1212
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,072
- Steve and Jerry?
- Yeah, who are they?

1213
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,840
That's classified information.

1214
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,511
Hey, Ron. I want to see
what you can do

1215
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,557
- with my.45.
- All right.

1216
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,717
Yeah, maybe you'll get
that nigger next time.

1217
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,195
Ooh.

1218
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,675
Fifty bucks?

1219
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,520
- You got it.
- I'll take that bet.

1220
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,239
Fuck, how about ten?

1221
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,376
- Son of a bitch!
- All right, where's my money?

1222
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,154
- Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
- Not bad. Hot damn.

1223
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,800
Well, my old man bought me
a toy cap gun when I was a kid,

1224
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,837
and been shooting ever since.

1225
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,071
- That's a hell of a cap gun.
- He can shoot.

1226
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,435
- All right, let's go.
- Damn.

1227
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,920
Pack it up.

1228
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,753
Ron Stallworth,
motherfucker.

1229
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,030
Hey, Walter.

1230
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,839
Hey, I'm better
than I used to be, right?

1231
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,016
- I'm gooder than I was.
- You're definitely doing

1232
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,430
a little bit better,
but I don't think "gooder" is a word,

1233
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,749
but you're doing real good.

1234
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,435
<i>And Bernie Casey.</i>

1235
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,080
<i>- Ooh. Bernie Casey.
- Brother's strong.</i>

1236
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,711
<i>But</i> Cleopatra Jones <i>is the one.</i>

1237
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,190
<i>It's about time we started
seeing a strong sister like that.</i>

1238
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,872
Well, Tamara Dobson
did play a cop, right?

1239
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,919
It's a black exploitation film,
which is a fantasy.

1240
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,434
Real life's not like that.

1241
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,638
Real life is no <i>Cleopatra Jones</i>
or <i>Coffy.</i>

1242
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,896
<i>What,
you don't dig Pam Grier?</i>

1243
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,957
<i>She's fine as red wine
and twice as mellow.</i>

1244
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,520
Pam Grier
is doing her thing,

1245
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,473
but in real life, it's just
pigs killing black folks.

1246
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,871
What if there was a cop
trying to change that?

1247
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,360
From inside?

1248
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,909
Yes, from inside.

1249
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,038
You can't change things from the inside.
It's a racist system.

1250
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,633
- You just give up like that?
- No.

1251
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,473
We fight for
what black people really need,

1252
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,233
- black liberation.
- Right, right.

1253
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,114
- So, can't you do that from the inside?
- No, you can't.

1254
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,272
The white man won't give up
his position in power without a struggle.

1255
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,120
What did Du Bois say
about double consciousness?

1256
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,352
Twoness?
Being an American and a Negro?

1257
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,353
Two warring ideals
inside one dark body.

1258
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,153
That's heavy, Patrice.

1259
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,595
I feel that,

1260
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,312
like I'm two people
all the time.

1261
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,953
But you shouldn't
have to be.

1262
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,511
We shouldn't have a war
going on inside ourselves.

1263
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,717
We should just be black.

1264
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,072
We're not there
yet, though.

1265
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,989
Well, I'm tired
of waiting.

1266
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,594
I got a serious
question for you.

1267
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,433
- Oh, yeah? What?
- Very serious.

1268
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,556
Uh-huh.

1269
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,040
<i>Shaft</i> or <i>Super Fly?</i>

1270
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,112
- What?
- Pick one.

1271
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,991
A private detective over
a pimp any day and twice on Sundays.

1272
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,514
All right.

1273
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,917
Ron O'Neal
or Richard Roundtree?

1274
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,798
Richard Roundtree.
Pimps ain't heroes.

1275
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,759
Well, Ron O'Neal isn't a pimp,
although he played the hell out of one.

1276
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,275
That image
does damage to our people.

1277
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,672
Geez, it's a movie.
Give it a rest.

1278
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,274
I can't let it rest.

1279
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,515
You jive turkey.

1280
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,496
- Who you calling jive turkey, jive turkey?
- I'm calling you a jive turkey.

1281
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,776
I got a Tamara roundhouse coming.

1282
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,234
- Jive turkey.
- It's coming...

1283
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,176
- It's coming around...
- Get out of here with that!

1284
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,639
Jive turkey.

1285
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,120
Wrong address.

1286
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,759
Sorry to bother you, sir.

1287
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,480
Have a good night.

1288
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,549
Hello?

1289
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,600
Hey.

1290
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,035
Sorry, had to work late.

1291
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,554
How are you guys doing?

1292
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,236
Got a beer for you,
Mr. Stallworth.

1293
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,593
- Thanks.
- You got a twin.

1294
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,631
- What?
- You got a twin.

1295
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,915
Twin what?

1296
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,395
A twin twin.

1297
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,999
And your twin is a nigger.

1298
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,354
Looked in the phone book.

1299
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,636
Went over to what
I thought was his place.

1300
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,639
I found a nig there.

1301
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,319
Well, my number's unlisted.

1302
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,993
What address did you go to?

1303
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,396
Over on Bluestem Lane.

1304
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,551
Bluestem Lane?
No, I live on 21st Street.

1305
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,235
What'd I tell you? Hmm?
Nothing to worry about.

1306
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,360
So, you don't know
that nigger?

1307
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,955
Oh! That's that nigger
I keep in the woodpile.

1308
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,976
You're right. I thought
you were talking about somebody else.

1309
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,070
No, I don't.

1310
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,953
1813 South 21st Street.

1311
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,520
Come by sometime.
We'll have a beer.

1312
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,080
And you know what?

1313
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,995
That loudmouth
Black Student Union bitch

1314
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,595
that's been in the papers
complaining about the police,

1315
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,875
she was there.

1316
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,030
That fucking cunt?

1317
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,680
Like to close those
monkey lips permanently.

1318
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,950
Hey, don't say that.

1319
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,756
Not until I get her lips
around the head of my dick.

1320
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,553
Can we play some goddamn poker now?
Are you done?

1321
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,600
Ron Stallworth, you enter...
You entertain me.

1322
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,034
Entertain me a lot more

1323
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,511
than that one-eyed nigger,
Sammy Davis, Jr.

1324
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,114
I'll say that, though.

1325
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,119
They can dance.
They can dance.

1326
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,475
I'll give them that.

1327
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,433
About all
I'll fucking give them.

1328
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,798
We've got active-duty soldiers
from Fort Carson.

1329
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,273
Going to CID with that.

1330
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,236
Two mystery boys,
Steve and Jerry.

1331
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,176
Those are those fishy Army guys
I was telling you about.

1332
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,634
Old Klan crew.

1333
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,076
Felix's old Klan crew.
Your buddy.

1334
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,435
New Klan Walter.

1335
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,477
Walter's a general
without an army.

1336
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,438
Felix's crew is stronger
than his.

1337
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,036
Oh. Of course,
Felix's wife, Connie.

1338
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,816
It's crazy you've been
talking to David Duke.

1339
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,479
My ace boon coon
running partner.

1340
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,073
Now that
we got this, though,

1341
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,640
Ronny boy, I'm telling you,
we're on a roll, baby.

1342
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,949
This is it.

1343
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,953
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

1344
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,272
"Ron Stallworth, member
in good standing for the year.

1345
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,513
"Knights of the Ku Klux Klan."

1346
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,115
That's us.
Stallworth Brothers.

1347
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,590
Yeah, well, you don't have
that little psychopath, Felix,

1348
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,876
staring at you,
asking where you live.

1349
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,791
I'm Jewish, yes,
but I wasn't raised to be.

1350
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,760
It wasn't part of my life.

1351
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:32,517
I never thought much about being Jewish.
Nobody around me was Jewish.

1352
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,796
You know, I wasn't going
to a bunch of Bar Mitzvahs.

1353
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,513
I didn't have a Bar Mitzvah.

1354
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,279
I was just
another white kid.

1355
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,389
And now I'm in some basement
denying it out loud.

1356
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,198
I never thought much about it.
Now I'm thinking about it all the time.

1357
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:00,275
About
rituals and heritage.

1358
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,200
Is that passing?

1359
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,951
Well, then I have
been passing.

1360
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,393
I don't want that.

1361
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,153
It sounds like
they're watching us.

1362
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,656
I don't know.
I was asleep. I don't know.

1363
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,560
I don't know what
we're supposed to do.

1364
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,795
Look at this bullshit.

1365
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,000
Where'd you find these?

1366
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,400
Plastered all over
my windshield,

1367
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,096
but they're all over
the neighborhood, too.

1368
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,315
Is this real?

1369
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,880
Real as can be.

1370
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,634
Intimidation?

1371
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,918
Clearly, this is about
the Black Student Union and you.

1372
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,680
- Me?
- Well, you've been outspoken

1373
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,315
about the incident with the police
when Brother Kwame was here.

1374
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,471
So, next, they'll have
a burning cross out front?

1375
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,936
All right,
they're just trying to get to you.

1376
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,316
Intimidate, like you said.
Fear tactics.

1377
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,392
If you don't let 'em scare you,
they got nothing.

1378
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,713
But keep your eyes open.
Be cool, okay?

1379
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,632
That's the damn problem.

1380
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,593
We always too cool.

1381
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,000
Way too cool.

1382
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,913
Well, maybe we should
call the police.

1383
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:09,239
How we know this ain't some of the KKK's
honky-pig partners passing out this shit?

1384
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,595
Let me ask you...
Excuse us.

1385
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,856
- Let me ask you something.
- Excuse us for what?

1386
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,997
"Cool." Want me to be cool?
I'll be cool.

1387
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:26,351
And it also safeguards against
the CSPD, which is nice.

1388
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,075
Yeah.

1389
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,672
Yeah, you soak
the wood in kerosene

1390
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,716
and light a cig
on a pack of matches.

1391
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,918
It kind of buys you some time
to get the fuck out

1392
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,639
before the cross
catches fire.

1393
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,234
Yeah.

1394
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,153
Must be quite a sight.

1395
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,079
Oh, yeah, it is.

1396
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,996
It's great.
It's a real bonfire.

1397
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,072
You can see it from miles away,
you know?

1398
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,478
Good visibility,
as Walter would say.

1399
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,753
Freaks out the Jew media,
and it,

1400
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,240
well, it keeps niggers
on their nigger toes.

1401
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,555
Oh, look at that. Damn,
there's another one.

1402
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,153
The pigs are out
tonight, yeah.

1403
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,436
Good job. Send another one.

1404
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,113
Lot of these guys
in the Army?

1405
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,034
We got a couple.

1406
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,158
We got a few
on active duty, yeah.

1407
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,440
I just finished
my second tour in 'Nam.

1408
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,356
- No shit.
- Yeah.

1409
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,759
My guy.

1410
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,437
Hey, Ron, do you happen
to know anything about C-4?

1411
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,114
You being in
the military and all?

1412
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,673
Enough to make
shit blow up.

1413
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,719
<i>...program dares
to love white people,</i>

1414
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,475
<i>white heritage
and white freedom.</i>

1415
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,233
<i>This program also
dares to expose</i>

1416
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,596
<i>- the Jewish supremacism...</i>
- Here come my boys.

1417
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,034
Here come the cavalry.

1418
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,080
<i>...and the criminal banking
establishment.</i>

1419
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,800
<i>These criminal bankers,
the criminal Fed,</i>

1420
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,712
<i>the establishment is...</i>

1421
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,993
<i>They're ethnically
cleansing our people,</i>

1422
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,399
<i>not only in the United States.</i>

1423
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,439
<i>Not only in the United States.</i>

1424
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,839
<i>The only thing that
we hear today from politicians...</i>

1425
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,913
You all, cross burning is off.
Too many cops, God damn it.

1426
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,311
<i>"Right, thank you, black people.
I love black people."</i>

1427
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,359
<i>And, of course, every
politician, every politician</i>

1428
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:26,511
<i>has to talk and genuflect to
the real rulers of our society and say,</i>

1429
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,399
<i>"I want to thank
the Jewish people.</i>

1430
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,113
<i>"I love the Jewish people.</i>

1431
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,835
<i>"The Jewish people
are always our friends</i>

1432
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,799
<i>"no matter what they do,</i>

1433
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,520
<i>"no matter how much
they destroy our country.</i>

1434
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,277
<i>"It's just wonderful.
You know, we just love the Jews."</i>

1435
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,720
<i>And no senator or congressman</i>

1436
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,555
<i>would dare get up and say,
"I love white people.</i>

1437
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,632
<i>"I love white heritage.</i>

1438
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,320
<i>"I love my people,
and I love the culture</i>

1439
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,959
<i>"that was created in Europe.</i>

1440
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,680
<i>"And this great Western,
Christian civilization.</i>

1441
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,752
<i>"I want to see that persevere.</i>

1442
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,355
<i>"You know, I want to see
that be enriched."</i>

1443
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,110
A lot of people think
I hate Negroes, but I don't.

1444
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,151
And the Organization
doesn't, either.

1445
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,953
They just need to be
with their own.

1446
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,993
That's what Pinky would say.

1447
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,958
Pinky didn't mind
segregation one bit.

1448
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,536
She just wanted to be
with her own kind.

1449
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,155
Sounds like she was
a Mammy to you.

1450
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,754
You ever seen
<i>Gone with the Wind?</i>

1451
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,593
Pinky was my
Hattie McDaniel.

1452
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,216
She won the Oscar
for that role.

1453
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,696
You know,
Best Supporting Actress, so...

1454
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,393
You were Scarlett,
and she was Mammy.

1455
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,480
<i>That's right.</i>

1456
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,835
- Right.
<i>- That's funny.</i>

1457
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,593
<i>When she passed,
it was like...</i>

1458
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,360
Well, it was like we lost
a member of the family.

1459
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,830
A good nigger
is funny like that.

1460
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,352
In that sense,
they're like a good dog.

1461
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,918
They get real close to you,
and as soon as you lose them,

1462
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,514
it just breaks your heart.

1463
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,034
That's well said, Ron.

1464
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,715
- I knew a coon once.
- Did you?

1465
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,554
Yeah, that Negro lived
across the street from us.

1466
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,917
I must have been
six or seven.

1467
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,519
His nickname
was Butter Biscuit.

1468
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,794
How'd he get
that nickname?

1469
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,118
He loved his mama's
butter biscuits.

1470
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,840
Yum, yum.

1471
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,990
Me and Butter Biscuit
played together every day.

1472
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,920
One day, my father
came home early from work.

1473
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,510
He told me I couldn't play
with that little spook anymore

1474
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,557
because I was white

1475
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,791
and Butter Biscuit
was a nigger.

1476
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,839
That's so rich.

1477
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,551
<i>Well, your father sounds
like a terrific man.</i>

1478
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,559
He was a true American.

1479
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,560
Taught me what was right.

1480
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,474
This is why we need
more people like you and me

1481
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,032
in public office.
Get this country back on track.

1482
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,470
Amen.

1483
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,233
For America
to achieve its...

1484
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,917
Uh, its greatness again.

1485
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,480
Absolutely.

1486
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,638
Boy, I sure wish we had
a chance to chat face-to-face.

1487
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,558
In due time, my friend.

1488
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,798
In due time, I will be
in Colorado Springs

1489
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,310
for your initiation.

1490
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,950
You're coming
to Colorado Springs, sir?

1491
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,191
You bet
your Mayflower Society ass I am.

1492
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,709
You're darn tooting.

1493
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,833
All right, I pulled
the materials that you asked for.

1494
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,320
- Okay.
- So you just move it around

1495
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,317
like this to see the images.

1496
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,296
Once you try it,
I think you'll get the hang of it.

1497
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,879
- Okay? Got it?
- Thank you.

1498
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,576
Okay, I'll be at the desk
if you need anything.

1499
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,000
Okay. Thank you.

1500
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,639
<i>Thanks for getting
back to me.</i>

1501
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,916
Listen, I think we need
a new leader.

1502
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,318
Someone everyone
can unite behind.

1503
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,716
I just don't think
I'm gonna carry the votes.

1504
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,036
Felix would love
to be the one,

1505
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,319
but I can't let that happen.

1506
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,476
He's a crazy son of a bitch.

1507
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,400
Goddamn loose cannon.

1508
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,312
No, we need
someone articulate,

1509
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:12,395
someone... Someone who displays
real leadership qualities.

1510
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,314
And I think it should be you.

1511
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,914
I gotta think about this.

1512
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,711
My father, he's sick,
and he lives in El Paso.

1513
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,314
I don't know
if I can handle both.

1514
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,079
Sorry to hear that.

1515
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,200
Think about it.

1516
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,072
You're a smart
and diligent man,

1517
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,273
and I've got no doubt
that you could handle it.

1518
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,036
I think it's time
we get some new blood in here.

1519
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,237
- Yeah?
- New ideas.

1520
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:43,996
For that reason,

1521
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,760
I'm planning to step down
as your president.

1522
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,998
But I would like to make
a nomination.

1523
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,678
Mr. Ron Stallworth
for chapter president.

1524
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,035
We just met this guy.

1525
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,510
He just walked in
off the street.

1526
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,713
Let me ask a question.

1527
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,798
Is there anybody here who's willing to
put their neck on the line for Ron?

1528
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,200
I'll vouch for Ron.

1529
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,433
You know who else
vouches for Ron?

1530
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,710
Mr. Duke.

1531
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,360
Look, it's a big honor,
but I... I can't accept.

1532
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,037
The trouble is, what you good men need is
a president who will be constant.

1533
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,349
On call day in, day out.

1534
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,671
My old man is sick.
I just found out.

1535
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,816
So I'm going to be back
and forth between here and Dallas.

1536
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,513
El Paso, Flip, El Paso!

1537
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,750
Thought it was El Paso.

1538
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,229
It is. What did I say?

1539
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,118
- Dallas.
- Which one is it, Ron?

1540
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,953
Make up your mind.

1541
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,318
Dallas is where the layover is.
El Paso is where my father is.

1542
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,632
Dallas, that's where
they killed that nigger lover, Kennedy.

1543
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,280
Where you learned that?

1544
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,551
I can read. I can.

1545
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,359
Well, we'll pray
for your pop's health.

1546
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,995
It's him.

1547
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,119
<i>Hey, Ron,
I don't share this</i>

1548
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,510
<i>- with a lot of people, but...</i>
- Yeah.

1549
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,399
Well, I'm anxious
to meet you.

1550
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,079
Excited to meet
you, too, Ron.

1551
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,830
Aren't you ever concerned of
some smart-aleck nigger calling you,

1552
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,434
pretending to be white?

1553
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:04,196
No. I can always tell
when I'm talking to a Negro.

1554
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,396
How so?

1555
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,153
Take you, for example, Ron.

1556
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,956
Me?

1557
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,116
Yeah.

1558
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,120
<i>I mean, I can tell
that you're a</i>

1559
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,680
pure Aryan white man from
the way you pronounce certain words.

1560
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,394
Can you give me
any examples?

1561
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:34,037
Yeah, take the word "are."

1562
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,717
Pure Aryan like you or I would
pronounce it correctly. "Are."

1563
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,873
Negro pronounces it "are-uh."

1564
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,798
Did you ever notice that?
It's like, "Are-uh

1565
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,800
"you gonna fry up that

1566
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,670
"crispy fried chicken,
soul brother?"

1567
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,592
<i>You know?</i>

1568
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,960
Sorry.

1569
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,555
Wow.

1570
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,519
You are so white.
Thank you for teaching me this lesson.

1571
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:04,736
If you had not brought it to my attention,
I wouldn't have noticed the difference

1572
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,513
between how we talk
and how Negroes talk.

1573
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,000
Good, good.

1574
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,674
Yeah.

1575
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,712
I'd love to continue
this conversation in Colorado Springs.

1576
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,952
It's beautiful here,
sir. God's country.

1577
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,838
Well, that's
what I hear, Ron.

1578
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,355
I look forward
to meeting you,

1579
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,479
and, uh, we'll be
talking real soon.

1580
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,233
God bless White America.

1581
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,160
Come back.

1582
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,136
- Oh, my God.
- Who are you giving the finger?

1583
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,160
Hello?

1584
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,356
It's Felix.

1585
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,759
<i>Catch you at a bad time?</i>

1586
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,912
<i>No, not at all.
I'm just finishing a meal.</i>

1587
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,633
Meeting, my house. Now.

1588
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,792
<i>Ron, get your ass in gear.</i>

1589
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,318
And don't tell
mealymouth Walter.

1590
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,552
Welcome to the promised land.

1591
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,838
In about a week's time,

1592
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,959
we'll be welcoming
Mr. David Duke to our city.

1593
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,316
- Oh, yeah.
- Who's packing tonight?

1594
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:10,955
I'm packing.

1595
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,040
Amen.

1596
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,674
Where's your piece, Ron?

1597
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,758
Well, you know,
I don't carry it on me all the time.

1598
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,913
"Don't carry."

1599
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,594
No, that...

1600
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,640
I got you covered.

1601
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,153
Won't happen again.

1602
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,519
We're gonna need
your good shot come next Sunday.

1603
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,120
Why? What's next Sunday?

1604
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,636
The war is gonna
come to us.

1605
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,115
Well, fuck yeah.

1606
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,635
Looks like we got ourselves
another soldier.

1607
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,656
Just make sure
that when you're at the steakhouse,

1608
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,114
you got your new
friend with you.

1609
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,472
And, Ron, you're gonna
want to name your piece.

1610
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,710
This is Betsey.

1611
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,856
- Don't point that at me. Jesus Christ.
- I'm sorry.

1612
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,190
Don't fucking point the gun
at anybody ever.

1613
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,397
I know what I'm doing.
I know how to use this thing.

1614
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,672
- Honey. Do you ever have second thoughts?
- Mmm-hmm.

1615
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,555
About what?

1616
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,589
Killing them.

1617
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,792
Never think twice
about killing niggers.

1618
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,416
You won't be able to
take it back, though.

1619
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,159
They're the first
of many niggers

1620
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,994
- that must die, honey bun.
- I know. It's just

1621
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,992
becoming so real.
I always thought it would be like a dream.

1622
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,196
I know.

1623
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,239
It's just so beautiful.

1624
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:31,159
We're cleansing this country of
a backwards race of chimpanzees.

1625
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,717
First the spooks.

1626
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,597
Then the kikes.

1627
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,279
Free at last,
free at last.

1628
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,153
Thank God Almighty,

1629
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,800
free of them
niggers at last.

1630
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,830
I love it when you
do that, honey.

1631
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,353
Mmm.

1632
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,399
We've talked about killing
niggers for so many years,

1633
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,077
and now it's
really happening.

1634
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,389
Hmm.

1635
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:03,269
My old man always told me good
things come to those who wait.

1636
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,635
Mmm.

1637
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,913
Thank you for
bringing me into your life.

1638
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,071
For loving me like you do.

1639
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:16,235
For giving me
a purpose, direction.

1640
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,154
This could be
the new Boston Tea Party.

1641
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,515
Mmm.

1642
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,669
Mr. Stallworth.

1643
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,399
Pleased to meet you.

1644
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,518
Names of chapter members?

1645
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,394
What is this about?

1646
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,474
Two names on your list
work at NORAD.

1647
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,677
The two mystery men,
Steve and Jerry?

1648
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,197
Real names are Harry Dricks
and Kevin Nelson.

1649
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,596
Two clowns with
top security clearances.

1650
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:30,312
These Klansmen are in charge
of monitoring our safety.

1651
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,357
You've done a service
to your country.

1652
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,878
We've been following
your investigation.

1653
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,670
Impressive.

1654
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,877
Last night,
Fort Carson reported

1655
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,317
several C-4 explosives
missing from their armory.

1656
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,757
- No suspects.
- Klan?

1657
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,911
Wait, the KKK
and the United States Army?

1658
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,951
You won't see this
on the news for obvious reasons,

1659
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,032
but thought it might be
of interest to you.

1660
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,994
If you know about a possible
attack, I need to know when.

1661
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,595
You're the one with
the impressive investigation.

1662
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,195
But can't you
or the FBI chip in?

1663
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,315
Sir?

1664
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,716
FBI?

1665
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,557
Federal Bureau
of Investigation?

1666
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,199
We never had
this conversation.

1667
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,896
You can hate me
all you want, all right?

1668
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,656
Just promise me
you won't go to that protest.

1669
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,875
I'm going. We're going.

1670
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,559
What are you
talking about?

1671
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:34,077
I can't get into specifics,
but today the Klan is planning an attack.

1672
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,874
- Then we have to tell the people.
- It's not an option.

1673
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,553
Ungawa, Black Power!

1674
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,714
What's wrong with you?

1675
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,839
No one else can know
while it's an active investigation.

1676
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,833
Active investigation?
And pray tell, how do you know that?

1677
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,714
Are you a pig?

1678
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,677
- No.
- What are you, then?

1679
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,513
Ungawa, Black Power!

1680
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,434
Ungawa, Black Power!
Ungawa, Black Power!

1681
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,920
Want to sit?

1682
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,912
No. I'll stand.

1683
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:04,238
Ungawa, Black Power!
Ungawa, Black Power!

1684
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,039
I'm an undercover detective.

1685
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,359
I'm investigating the Klan.

1686
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,794
Fucking KKK?

1687
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,749
Ron Stallworth, you lied to me.
Is that even your real name?

1688
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,071
Ron Stallworth
is my first and last name.

1689
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,640
Look, today
is not the day, Patrice.

1690
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,096
I take my duties
as the president of

1691
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,416
the Black Student
Union seriously.

1692
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,760
Well, how much
good did it do?

1693
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,638
You could sit in the middle
of Nevada Avenue,

1694
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,195
light yourself on fire,
the KKK will still be here.

1695
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,875
Well, at least I would be
doing something, unlike you.

1696
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,758
- Unlike me?
- Yeah.

1697
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,880
Don't think, just because
I don't wear a black beret

1698
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,560
or a black leather jacket,
black Ray-Bans,

1699
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,037
screaming, "Kill Whitey,"
that I don't care about my people.

1700
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,632
The night we saw
Brother Kwame speak,

1701
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,518
were you undercover
then, too?

1702
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,710
That's not fair.

1703
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,256
- You have to understand...
- Answer the question.

1704
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,715
Were you undercover
the night we met? Yes or no?

1705
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,794
Ron Stallworth, are you for the revolution
and the liberation of black people?

1706
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,912
I'm an undercover detective
for the Colorado Springs Police.

1707
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,079
It's my J-O-B.
That's the truth.

1708
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,356
House niggers said
they had a J-O-B, too.

1709
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,799
You disgust me.

1710
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,111
My brother,
you need to wake up.

1711
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:12,196
Ungawa, Black Power!
Ungawa, Black Power!

1712
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,873
<i>Are you
fucking kidding me?</i>

1713
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,952
You don't cross those lines.

1714
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,999
This is about an investigation,
not a relationship.

1715
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,396
Hate to break that
blue wall of silence.

1716
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,790
Nice one.

1717
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,355
- Is Patrice really in danger?
- Maybe.

1718
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,920
Ungawa, Black Power!

1719
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,112
Ungawa, Black Power!

1720
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,835
It's off.

1721
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,195
Yep.

1722
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,678
You'll know soon enough.

1723
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,315
What?

1724
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,278
Felix just said the march
has been canceled.

1725
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,591
- Why?
- Could be all the death threats.

1726
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,515
No, they're
used to that.

1727
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,751
And there's been
nothing more about the explosives?

1728
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,510
No.

1729
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,829
Fuck it.

1730
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,080
We get them
on weapons charges

1731
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,616
and stop them from doing
anything that way.

1732
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,240
Then what? You know,
misdemeanor at best.

1733
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,296
- Then they walk.
- I have a special assignment for Ron.

1734
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,640
Ron already
has an assignment.

1735
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,096
Yeah, what could be more important
than preventing an attack, sir?

1736
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,954
We have very credible threats
against David Duke's life.

1737
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,874
So, Ron, I am assigning
you security detail

1738
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,360
- for David Duke.
- What?

1739
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,397
With all due respect,
sir, I don't think

1740
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,437
this is a wise decision,
given the situation.

1741
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,035
Who cares what you think?
Duke needs protection.

1742
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,839
There's no one
else available.

1743
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,354
Nut-cracking time.

1744
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,238
Put aside your
personal politics.

1745
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,073
Chief, it's not about that,
and you know it.

1746
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:39,679
David Duke and Ron have been
talking on the phone several times.

1747
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,035
If he recognizes his voice...

1748
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:45,433
If any of the Klansmen do,
it'll compromise our entire investigation.

1749
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,400
- It's too dangerous.
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

1750
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,671
but didn't you boast to me
that you were fluent

1751
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,559
in both English and jive?

1752
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,390
- Do you remember that?
- Answer the Chief.

1753
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,880
Oh, shut the fuck up,
Landers.

1754
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,056
You know, you've been trying
to sabotage me since day one.

1755
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,878
Why are you getting
so worked up, boy?

1756
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,360
- Hey, Ron!
- Hey, Ron, come on.

1757
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,016
- Ron, Ron, no! Ron!
- It's not worth it.

1758
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,096
- Okay, okay, all right.
- Just...

1759
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,120
- Go, go, go.
- Stay put.

1760
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,016
- Ron. Whoa, whoa!
- What the fuck is that?

1761
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,191
Gotta bring something
to get something, Landers.

1762
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,873
Eat a white dick!

1763
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,271
You let him get
to you that easy?

1764
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,717
You don't have
a shot with David Duke.

1765
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,119
First, the primary target.

1766
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,919
Felix says
you're doing it.

1767
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:32,036
So all you have to do is
set the pocketbook on the front porch,

1768
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,720
the back porch, a sidewalk.
Doesn't matter.

1769
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:38,038
As long as it's against the building,
you can plant it anywhere.

1770
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,033
I got enough C-4 here
to take out the whole thing.

1771
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:43,360
Be careful.

1772
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,992
- You understand?
- I understand.

1773
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,576
All you have to do
when you placed it...

1774
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,717
Hey, sweetie. You listening?
All you have to do

1775
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,838
when you placed it
is flip the switch.

1776
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,078
Flip the switch.
That's it.

1777
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,709
You got it?

1778
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,552
Miss Black Student
Union Bitch

1779
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,472
is bringing in some
old coon to speak.

1780
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,674
Place should be packed.

1781
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,794
So, Brother Walker,
nothing but rubble.

1782
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,439
And barbecued niggers.

1783
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,640
- And what happens if that don't work?
- Plan B.

1784
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,154
Can you
handle it, honey?

1785
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,039
You can count on me.

1786
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,511
I've been waiting
to do my part.

1787
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,159
Sweet as candy.

1788
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,311
Ah, look
at the lovebirds.

1789
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,792
Can I feel the C-4?

1790
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,473
No C-4 for you.

1791
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,956
You'll blow us all the fuck up
to kingdom come.

1792
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,911
- What is this black...
- Out here with

1793
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,799
- the great David Duke.
- Look at this fucking guy.

1794
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,936
How's he getting
away with that?

1795
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,917
Mr. Duke's security detail.

1796
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,673
- What?
- Fuck this guy.

1797
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,831
Mr. Duke.
I'm a detective

1798
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,196
from the Colorado Springs
Police Department.

1799
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,034
I'm here to keep
you safe today.

1800
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,198
- I'm sorry, have we met before?
- Mmm-mmm.

1801
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,318
You may know that there's several credible
threats against your life.

1802
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,595
How's it going out here?

1803
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,273
There have been
threats on my life,

1804
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,400
and this is the detective
they've assigned as my bodyguard.

1805
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,950
Mr. Duke, I don't agree
with your philosophies.

1806
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,879
However,
I'm a professional,

1807
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,755
so I will do everything
within my means and beyond

1808
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,352
- to make sure you're safe.
- Okay, I appreciate your professionalism.

1809
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,514
Allow me, sir.

1810
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,150
Thank you.

1811
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,232
- Right this way, sir.
- Walt.

1812
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,432
- Bro. How are you?
- Sir.

1813
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,352
Sorry for all
the extra security today.

1814
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,233
Can't be too careful.

1815
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,275
Yeah, I know.
We have a strong, strong...

1816
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:44,910
Hey, fellas.

1817
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,720
Yeah, like you were saying,
last week on the phone...

1818
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,120
Well, Mr. Duke.

1819
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,192
I would like you to meet
our newest recruit,

1820
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,680
Ron Stallworth.

1821
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,590
Ron Stallworth, it is a pleasure to
finally meet you in person.

1822
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,194
Same. Same.
You as well.

1823
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,555
This is our brother, Jesse.

1824
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,869
- I'm Jesse.
- Hey, Jesse.

1825
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,235
- Ron.
- Ron, yeah.

1826
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,631
- I've heard so much about you.
- Oh, okay.

1827
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,392
I didn't realize how nervous
I was gonna be.

1828
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:09,909
That's all right.

1829
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,793
What's that doing here?

1830
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,831
That's the fucking cop
they got to guard Mr. Duke.

1831
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,391
Isn't that the living shit?

1832
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,676
Gentlemen, it's time.

1833
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,352
- Ron, why don't you follow me?
- Okay.

1834
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,199
Let's go. Let's go.

1835
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,719
You stay right here.

1836
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,514
You hear?

1837
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,032
God, America's going to hell
in a handbasket.

1838
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,871
That started out
as a nice spring day

1839
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,395
back there in Waco, Texas.

1840
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,272
May 15, 1916.

1841
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,874
Jesse Washington...

1842
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,472
Was a friend of mine.

1843
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,632
He was 17.

1844
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,320
I was 18.

1845
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,560
We kind of looked at Jesse
and called him slow.

1846
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,634
Today,

1847
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,358
you'd call him
mentally retarded.

1848
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,833
They claimed Jesse

1849
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,834
raped and murdered
a white woman

1850
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:00,836
by the name of Lucy Fryer.

1851
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,791
They put Jesse on trial,

1852
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,440
and he was convicted
by an all-white jury

1853
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,275
after they deliberated
for only four minutes.

1854
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,711
My brothers in Christ,

1855
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,636
Nobel Prize recipient,

1856
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:26,070
co-creator of the transistor
and a dear, dear friend of mine,

1857
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,879
Dr. William Shockley,

1858
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,239
whose groundbreaking scientific work
ushered in the computer age,

1859
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:36,030
has proven,
through his research with eugenics,

1860
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:39,956
that each of us here
has flowing through our veins

1861
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,759
the genes
of a superior race.

1862
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,115
It's a fact.

1863
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,234
It's a fact.
It can't be disputed.

1864
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,951
Today, we
celebrate that truth.

1865
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,397
Masks off, hoods on.

1866
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,231
I was working across the street
at the shoeshine parlor.

1867
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,478
<i>And after the verdict,</i>

1868
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,992
<i>a mob grabbed Jesse,</i>

1869
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:09,200
put a chain around his neck
and dragged him out of the courthouse.

1870
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,074
Oh, my God.

1871
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,999
I knew I had to hide.

1872
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,275
That way.

1873
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,953
Be careful, brother.

1874
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,354
Well, all right.

1875
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,476
<i>Where I was,
the shoe parlor</i>

1876
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,678
had a window
up in the attic.

1877
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,671
And I could see the crowd.

1878
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:33,400
They marched Jesse
through the streets.

1879
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,477
They stabbed him
and beat him.

1880
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,835
Oh!

1881
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,156
<i>And finally,
in a bloody heap,</i>

1882
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:45,790
they held him down
in the street

1883
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,553
and cut off his testicles.

1884
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,194
God,

1885
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:04,633
give us true white men.

1886
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,990
The Invisible Empire
demands strong minds,

1887
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,110
great hearts, true faith,

1888
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,559
clean and ready hands.

1889
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,959
Men who have honor.

1890
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,669
Men who will not lie.

1891
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,320
Men who can stand
before a demagogue

1892
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,638
and damn his treacherous
flatteries without blinking.

1893
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,558
God, give us real men.

1894
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,840
Courageous men who
flinch not at duty.

1895
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,833
Men of dependable character,
men of sterling worth.

1896
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:41,119
Then wrongs will be redressed,
and right shall rule the Earth.

1897
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,954
God, give us
true white men.

1898
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:47,720
Ron Stallworth.

1899
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:49,956
Rise.

1900
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:51,996
Step forward.

1901
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,954
The police
and the city officials

1902
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,518
were out there
watching him.

1903
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,720
- They cut off his fingers.
- Oh!

1904
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,793
And threw coal oil
all over his body.

1905
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,438
They lit a bonfire

1906
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:10,629
and raised him
and lowered him

1907
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,352
over these flames

1908
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,913
over and over
and over again.

1909
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,834
Ron Stallworth,

1910
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,038
are you a white,
non-Jewish American citizen?

1911
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,515
Yes.

1912
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,320
Yes what?

1913
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,914
Yes, I am a white,

1914
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,718
non-Jewish
American citizen.

1915
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,798
Are you in favor of
a white man's government

1916
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,519
- in this country?
- Yes.

1917
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,230
Ron Stallworth,
are you willing to dedicate your life

1918
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,040
to the protection,
the preservation

1919
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,120
and the advancement
of the white race

1920
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,635
in mind, in body

1921
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,513
- and in spirit?
- Yes.

1922
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,474
Be seated.

1923
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,360
The mayor had a photographer
by the name of Gildersleeve.

1924
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:07,671
He came and took pictures
of the whole thing.

1925
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,878
Those pictures were later
sold as postcards.

1926
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:23,833
Remove your hood.

1927
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,549
<i>They put Jesse's
charred body into a bag.</i>

1928
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,915
Remove your hood.

1929
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,957
<i>Dragged him
through town.</i>

1930
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,274
Remove your hood.

1931
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,117
<i>They sold the remains.</i>

1932
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,635
Remove your hood.

1933
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,313
<i>As souvenirs.</i>

1934
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,114
Remove your hood.

1935
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,199
<i>Lot of good
white folks just stood there</i>

1936
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,795
<i>like it was
a Fourth of July parade.</i>

1937
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,870
They even let the children
out of school

1938
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,514
on lunch hour.

1939
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,680
Remove your hood.

1940
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,791
<i>And all
I could do was to</i>

1941
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,839
watch and hope

1942
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,392
they wouldn't find me.

1943
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,595
Come.

1944
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,871
Welcome your brethren

1945
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,191
who have been
baptized by the light.

1946
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,272
- Please.
- Oh, my God!

1947
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,831
Let's give them
some applause!

1948
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:46,235
One of the reasons they had
done that to Jesse was a movie

1949
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,953
called <i>Birth of a Nation.</i>

1950
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,874
It had come out
the year before,

1951
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,999
and it was so powerful

1952
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:00,549
that it gave
the Ku Klux Klan a rebirth.

1953
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,080
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1954
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:06,000
Oh, my God. No!

1955
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,635
No!

1956
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:10,840
Oh, look at that one!

1957
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,599
Oh, he's disgusting.

1958
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,909
Oh!

1959
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,640
Oh, those poor women.

1960
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,750
Don't you do it!

1961
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,629
- Why?
- No.

1962
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:22,750
No.

1963
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:25,711
The ingenuity
of white women!

1964
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,312
<i>Today, they would call that
kind of movie a blockbuster.</i>

1965
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,514
<i>Everybody saw it.</i>

1966
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,160
That's disgusting.

1967
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:43,400
Even the president
of the United States,

1968
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:47,760
Woodrow Wilson,
showed it at the White House.

1969
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:54,759
And he said that it was "history
written with lightning."

1970
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:58,349
What... What is really...

1971
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,960
Oh, look at that
little pickaninny.

1972
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Watch, watch. They're gonna
scare the pickaninnies.

1973
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,116
Get out of there!

1974
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,351
- Move. Move.
- Get out of there!

1975
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,991
The inspiration!

1976
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,190
Get 'em out of there!

1977
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,760
- Go get 'em!
- Go!

1978
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:36,399
Go get 'em!

1979
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,794
Hey!

1980
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:42,753
- Send him to hell!
- String him up!

1981
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:44,035
String him up!

1982
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,029
Guilty!

1983
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,276
Get him on that horse.

1984
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,477
Get him up!
String him up!

1985
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,879
Yeah!

1986
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:10,592
White power!
White power! White power!

1987
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:18,029
That's why
we're here today.

1988
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:22,230
In the name
of Black Power.

1989
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,596
- Yes.
- Black Power. Black Power.

1990
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:27,390
Black Power! Black Power!

1991
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:31,350
Black Power! Black Power!
Black Power!

1992
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:38,397
I'd like you to do me a favor
and just look around.

1993
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:42,195
That's right.
Everyone just look around.

1994
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:48,193
Today, we are privileged
to be among white men.

1995
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,400
And white women.

1996
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,395
Such as yourselves.

1997
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,636
Real warriors.

1998
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,195
For the real America.

1999
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:59,239
The America that our ancestors
fought and died for.

2000
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,880
The true white
American race.

2001
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,510
The backbone from whence came
our great Southern heritage.

2002
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:09,714
And I want to thank you.

2003
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:11,554
Jesus Christ.

2004
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,518
I want to
thank you so much

2005
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,716
for never putting
your country second.

2006
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,439
- That's right.
- Hmm.

2007
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,716
- America first.
- America first.

2008
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:22,354
America first.

2009
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:25,558
America first!
America first!

2010
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,872
Ain't this a bitch.

2011
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,236
If I would have known
this was a Klan meeting,

2012
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:50,279
I wouldn't have taken
this motherfucking gig.

2013
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:52,511
Goddamn.

2014
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,553
Right on, right on.

2015
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:58,395
All right, now, when are you boys
gonna invite me down to Louisiana?

2016
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,597
We'd certainly
love to have you.

2017
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,456
Still a lot of work to be done.
I mean, you've done

2018
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,056
a great job whipping up
this chapter, but...

2019
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,816
Well, I could do a great job
on a national level.

2020
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,840
Excuse me.

2021
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:07,990
Walter, may I?

2022
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,595
Behave yourself.

2023
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:12,235
Mr. Duke, I just
want to say how

2024
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:16,519
honored my wife, Connie,
and I are for being in your presence.

2025
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,076
What's your name, friend?

2026
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,160
Felix.

2027
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,550
Felix, the pleasure's
all mine.

2028
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:24,360
We'd love to have you out to
the house for dinner sometime.

2029
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,797
We Coloradans can cook just as good
as those Cajun ladies you got down there.

2030
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:30,190
All right, now, Connie.

2031
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:31,794
We're on a very
tight schedule here,

2032
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,712
but you made a mistake.

2033
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:36,634
Next time I'm in town,
I'm gonna hold you to that, okay?

2034
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,480
Oh, I see Susie.

2035
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,517
I'll be back
in just a second.

2036
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:42,910
Hey.

2037
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,593
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

2038
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,776
- Is this your wife?
- Yep.

2039
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:46,936
- Hey. Ron. How are you?
- Hi.

2040
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,076
Nice to meet you.

2041
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,992
Never seen you
dressed up before.

2042
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,376
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Felix.

2043
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,278
- You have a fantastic night.
- Oh, thank you.

2044
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,229
America first.

2045
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,760
Hey, Ron,
how you doing?

2046
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,035
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Good.

2047
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,191
- He's a cop.
- Who?

2048
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,760
- That guy.
- Ron?

2049
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,560
- No, the other guy.
- Ron's a cop?

2050
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:11,553
His name is Phillip,
but his nickname is Flip.

2051
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,991
- Who's Phillip?
- Who's Ron? That's Phillip.

2052
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:15,736
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- That guy.

2053
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:18,150
That's the cop that sent me
to the fucking big house

2054
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,754
for armed fucking robbery.

2055
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,116
His fucking name is Phillip.
Phillip Zimmerman.

2056
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,839
- What's his name?
- Phillip Zimmerman.

2057
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,952
How many times
I gotta fucking tell you?

2058
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,157
Isn't that
a fucking Jew name?

2059
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:29,276
You can't go by that.

2060
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,716
Jews change their name
all the time to non-Jew names.

2061
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,837
I mean, they killed
Jesus, right?

2062
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,874
Ron Stallworth
is a fucking Jew.

2063
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,600
Could've been worse.

2064
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,160
How so?

2065
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,594
Could've been a nigger.

2066
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,796
Yeah.

2067
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,792
They built
this stuff out of...

2068
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,918
It starts to dissolve.
It wasn't water, you know.

2069
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:51,914
The beads take the...

2070
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,995
He is a nigger.

2071
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,750
Who?

2072
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:58,071
That cop guarding Duke.

2073
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,473
Zimmerman's
using his name.

2074
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:02,789
I guess
I could use mops.

2075
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,032
- Shall we tell the grand wizard?
- No, no, no. Not yet.

2076
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,079
I'll find the moment.

2077
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,596
Okay.

2078
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:12,515
Fucking Jew.

2079
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,360
Yeah, I know. We have
a strong future in America.

2080
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,920
I'm so glad
I made this trip.

2081
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,656
- With all these chapters...
- Well, that's what we

2082
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:22,016
- have to work on.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

2083
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,110
Hi.

2084
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:25,669
Mr. Duke,

2085
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:27,835
favor to ask.

2086
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:33,154
Nobody's gonna believe me when I tell them
that I was your personal bodyguard today.

2087
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,036
Care to take
a Polaroid with me?

2088
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,597
I don't know.
Do those cool shades come off?

2089
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,955
Oh, yes, sir, they do.

2090
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,514
- Okay.
- There we go.

2091
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,398
Hey, Jesse. Let's do this.
It'll be right.

2092
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2093
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:47,359
- Who should...
- What...

2094
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,750
- What's his name?
- Uh, Ron.

2095
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,271
- Stallworth.
- Ron. Ron, sir.

2096
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:54,272
Can you take this
picture of us, please?

2097
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,109
All right,
don't touch me.

2098
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,320
Great.

2099
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:05,754
- All right.
- All right.

2100
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:07,559
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

2101
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,233
Here we go. One.

2102
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,152
Two. Three.

2103
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,317
Jesus H. Christ!

2104
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,758
What did you just do, boy?

2105
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,399
I mean...

2106
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,477
What the hell
did you just do?

2107
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:27,760
Sir, if you lay
a finger on me,

2108
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,639
I'll arrest your ass
for assaulting a police officer.

2109
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:35,200
That's worth about
five years in prison.

2110
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,471
Try me.
See if I'm playing.

2111
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,995
Why don't you come down
to Louisiana sometime?

2112
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,473
See how we play.

2113
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:48,835
Boy, you better get your
nigger ass out of here now.

2114
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,114
Mmm-hmm.

2115
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,680
America first.

2116
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,796
Excuse me.

2117
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,360
May I? Thanks.

2118
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:02,176
- You ready?
- What, now?

2119
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:03,520
Don't be nervous.

2120
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,509
Okay. I'm leaving.

2121
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,640
- Remember what we talked about.
- Okay.

2122
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,275
Come here.

2123
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:14,199
Now you may do your job.

2124
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,078
- Okay.
- Nice and easy does it.

2125
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:21,754
Excuse me.

2126
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:24,794
Excuse me.

2127
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:36,789
Attention, all units.

2128
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:40,715
Be on the lookout for a brown truck
with a "white pride" bumper sticker.

2129
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:44,157
License plate, KE4108.

2130
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:54,430
Kills this big rat
in the back of our backyard.

2131
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:57,056
And I actually start to like
the fucking thing for the first time.

2132
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:58,434
I shit you not,
three days later,

2133
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,136
this little Girl Scout
comes to our door...

2134
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:01,310
Ron.

2135
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:03,631
I believe you
know my friend.

2136
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,594
Who's your friend?

2137
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,309
Hey.

2138
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,160
No, sorry, I don't think we've
met before. Ron Stallworth.

2139
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,516
Yeah? It's been
a few years, right?

2140
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,837
- Been a few years?
- Yeah.

2141
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:21,632
No, I'm sorry.
I don't think I can place you.

2142
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,912
- Did you two go to school together?
- No. I went to private school.

2143
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,435
Leavenworth, Kansas.

2144
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,876
Isn't that where
the federal penitentiary is?

2145
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,394
Matter of fact, it is.

2146
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:32,319
You know something
about that.

2147
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,200
- Don't you, Flip?
- Flip?

2148
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:35,634
Excuse me, gentlemen.

2149
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:39,430
There is an emergency phone call
in the hallway for a Felix Kendrickson.

2150
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,557
I'll be right back, Flip.

2151
01:49:58,600 --> 01:49:59,600
Hello?

2152
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,909
Felix.

2153
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,096
Jesus, they've
got cops everywhere.

2154
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,679
Somebody tipped them off.

2155
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:05,672
Oh, God,
there's another one!

2156
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:08,999
Calm down, baby.
We planned for this, all right?

2157
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,271
We'll go to plan B, okay?

2158
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,840
Okay, okay, okay.

2159
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,031
Okay, okay, okay, plan B.

2160
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:17,271
All right, baby?
You can do it.

2161
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,680
I'll be right there.

2162
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:19,989
All right.

2163
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:23,796
Remember when you said, one day,
I'm gonna need your help?

2164
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:25,678
This is it, baby.

2165
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:27,474
I love you, honey bun.

2166
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,274
I love you.

2167
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,671
I can make
America great again.

2168
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,136
- Oh, yeah.
- We need lawyers,

2169
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:42,799
we need doctors,
and we need...

2170
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:50,672
Excuse me, Mr. Duke.

2171
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,354
Let's go.

2172
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:02,877
Good talker.
He's a good talker.

2173
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,160
You'll have to excuse him,
Mr. Duke. I apologize.

2174
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:10,640
What was that all about?

2175
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,114
Why'd he keep
calling you Flip?

2176
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,038
We were in prison together.

2177
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:17,670
Years ago.

2178
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,114
Uh, it's an inside joke.

2179
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,676
Well, I certainly hope
everything's okay.

2180
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:26,677
Yeah, but I think he may have
violated his parole.

2181
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:29,276
I just need to use
the restroom real quick.

2182
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,950
Hey, where's Patrice?

2183
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,509
Patrice and Odetta took
Mr. Turner back to his hotel.

2184
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,240
Back up. Back up.

2185
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,560
<i>Freedom.
It dares to expose the fact</i>

2186
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,871
<i>that not only
is this a country,</i>

2187
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,434
<i>not a white racist country.</i>

2188
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:00,874
<i>It is a racist country.</i>

2189
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,394
<i>Indeed,
it is a racist country.</i>

2190
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:05,279
<i>It's an anti-white
racist country.</i>

2191
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:55,870
Fuck.

2192
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,593
But it's so important.

2193
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:15,030
Next time, we should work
on getting a sister in here.

2194
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,554
We need to be
hearing their stories.

2195
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,656
- Yep.
- We need to start doing this every week.

2196
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:20,353
I'll reach out and see
who I can get.

2197
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:21,755
Yeah.

2198
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,079
Colorado State Police.
Don't move.

2199
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:48,435
I said stop, damn it!

2200
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:49,954
No! Help me!

2201
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:51,759
Help me!

2202
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,274
Help me! Help me, please!

2203
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:54,760
Stop. Stop.

2204
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:01,896
- Where'd you put the bomb?
- No!

2205
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,513
You're hurting me!

2206
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,398
Where's the bomb?
Where'd you put it?

2207
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:06,920
- Get off me. Get off.
- Where is it?

2208
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,435
- Get off of me!
- Hold still. Stay still.

2209
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:11,376
- Stay still.
- I don't know what you're talking about!

2210
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,073
- Where's the bomb?
- Freeze!

2211
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:15,556
Get off her,
or I'll fucking shoot you.

2212
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,757
- Whoa. Get off her.
- Okay. All right.

2213
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,136
- Easy.
- I'm undercover.

2214
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:20,389
- He's got a gun!
- I'm a cop!

2215
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:21,536
- He touched me.
- She's a terrorist.

2216
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:22,710
That nigger attacked me.

2217
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,678
He tried to rape me.
Arrest him.

2218
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:26,560
- I'm an undercover cop!
- Show us your badge.

2219
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:28,376
- It's in my pocket, okay?
- What are you waiting for?

2220
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,096
- Show us your badge.
- It's in my pocket. Relax.

2221
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,776
That nigger attacked me.
He tried to rape me.

2222
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:33,400
- Arrest him. Arrest him!
- I'm a cop.

2223
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:35,216
- What are you doing?
- Get on the ground now!

2224
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,640
Yeah! Hit him!

2225
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:38,776
<i>When you think about
the fact that America</i>

2226
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:41,793
<i>is still well over 85% white,</i>

2227
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:46,079
<i>that America was founded
exclusively by white people</i>

2228
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,231
<i>who wrote a Declaration of
Independence</i>

2229
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,876
<i>and who fought
for our freedoms,</i>

2230
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:53,470
<i>were the basis of our
civilization and our culture</i>

2231
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,597
<i>and our Western Christian
society,</i>

2232
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:59,037
<i>that means that the Christian Church
that grew up in the world</i>

2233
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:03,120
<i>was overwhelmingly a white,
European phenomenon.</i>

2234
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:07,638
<i>The magnificent beauty
of the European people.</i>

2235
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:10,316
<i>But today, the word "white"
is a curse word...</i>

2236
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:11,629
Ron!

2237
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,439
<i>Anti-white...</i>

2238
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,354
Patrice!

2239
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:34,990
Patrice!

2240
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,039
Hey! Hey!

2241
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:47,696
- Stand down. Stand down!
- Who the fuck are you?

2242
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:49,552
Undercover cop,
you fucking idiot.

2243
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:51,040
The black guy's a cop?

2244
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:52,520
Give me your keys.

2245
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:57,470
Oh, my God, Felix...

2246
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:58,835
You're late.

2247
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,920
- Felix!
- Patrice, are you all right?

2248
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,474
Patrice.

2249
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,400
Felix.

2250
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:22,035
Our own group, Ron and P.

2251
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,296
- Mmm. I don't know about that.
- Go on tour.

2252
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:25,680
You know, they say two Afros
that touch together, they're...

2253
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:27,376
- It's good luck.
- Who said that?

2254
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,516
I read it somewhere.

2255
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:29,920
Tell me,
where'd you get this?

2256
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,151
- Saw this brother on <i>Soul Train.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

2257
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:34,256
- Really?
- And I just thought, I'mma take you there.

2258
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:36,296
- Gonna take you to California.
- You don't know Don Cornelius.

2259
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,357
That's my cousin
on my mama's sister's side.

2260
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:39,736
- Really?
- That's my cousin, yes.

2261
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,336
- So I got... I got access.
- Yeah?

2262
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,176
- What is his cousin's name?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2263
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:47,396
Who is the soul sister, Ron?

2264
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,000
You been holding out on me.

2265
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:50,833
All right, take it easy.
Take it easy.

2266
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,036
Oh...

2267
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,440
You don't remember me,
do you?

2268
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:55,709
Uh...

2269
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,314
Brother Kwame?

2270
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,279
Stokely Carmichael?

2271
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:03,153
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2272
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:06,756
You looked good that night,
but you look even better now.

2273
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,832
How often do you do that
to black people?

2274
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:10,276
Do what?

2275
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:13,398
Pull us over for nothing.
Harass us.

2276
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:16,075
Put your hands all over a woman
in the guise of searching her.

2277
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:18,231
Call us everything
but a child of God.

2278
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,039
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2279
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:22,954
Just like I told you, right,
he's just taking advantage.

2280
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:25,600
In the end, talking loud,
saying nothing.

2281
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:27,399
Let me tell you
both something.

2282
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:30,712
I've been keeping you people in line
in this city for years.

2283
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,359
What I did to your girl
that night,

2284
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,711
I could do to any of you
any time, any place.

2285
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,234
That's my prerogative.

2286
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:39,194
I could even bust a cap
in your black ass

2287
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:41,789
if I feel like it, and nothing
will be done about it.

2288
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:45,237
I wish the two of you'd been blown up
instead of good white folks. Get it?

2289
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:46,720
Oh, I do get it.

2290
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,280
- Do you get it, Patrice?
- Mmm. Yeah.

2291
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:49,595
I totally
and completely get it.

2292
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,034
Jimmy, did you get it?

2293
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:52,474
Oh, yes, I got it.

2294
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:53,835
Flip, did you get it?

2295
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:55,679
- Oh, yeah, I got it.
- Chief!

2296
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,752
- Do you get it?
- Oh, I really, really get it.

2297
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,096
You're under arrest.

2298
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:00,600
- What?
- Get him out of here.

2299
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,880
- Get up. Police brutality.
- Are you out of your minds?

2300
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:05,395
Let's go.
Police misconduct, sexual misconduct...

2301
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:07,096
- Thank you very much.
- Keep walking.

2302
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:09,240
- Tell it to the judge.
- What about my rights?

2303
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,136
- Power to the people.
- Power to the people.

2304
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,799
The old hidden mic trick.

2305
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,439
Yes, it was all my work.
Hello.

2306
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:15,715
To tape jobs.

2307
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,280
- Works every time.
- Hidden mics.

2308
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,436
Good job, everybody.

2309
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,030
Stallworth!

2310
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:32,434
Ronny!

2311
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:37,433
Five. Four. Three.

2312
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:39,671
Two. One.

2313
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:41,792
Swish!

2314
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,176
- Look who the cat dragged in.
- Thank you, thank you.

2315
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:47,159
There he is!
The man of the minute.

2316
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:48,913
Don't you mean "hour," Flip?

2317
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,878
You slow, you blow.

2318
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,189
Ah, Jimmy.

2319
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:58,856
That Polaroid stunt you pulled,
when you put your arms around them,

2320
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,553
I swear to God
I almost shit myself.

2321
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:03,075
I told you,
Ron was born ready.

2322
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,834
- Born ready is Ron.
- There he is!

2323
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:08,317
There's the crazy
son of a bitch

2324
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:09,720
Come over here.

2325
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:11,951
You. You, you, you, you.

2326
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,672
- You did good.
- Nah, we did good.

2327
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,136
Yeah, well, the Chief wants to
see us in his office right now.

2328
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,896
- Let's go. Here, after you.
- Let's go. No, after you.

2329
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,480
- Come on.
- You're the man of the hour.

2330
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:25,395
I cannot commend you enough
for what you have achieved.

2331
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,551
Do you realize there was
not one cross burning

2332
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:29,239
the entire time
you guys were involved?

2333
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,674
We're very aware, Chief.

2334
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:33,434
But all good things
have to come to an end.

2335
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:34,560
What does that mean?

2336
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:37,314
- Budget cuts.
- Budget cuts?

2337
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,752
And when did this happen?
Last night?

2338
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,629
I wish I had a choice, but my hands are
tied with this inflation.

2339
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:46,429
Besides, there no longer
appears to be any credible threats.

2340
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,718
Sounds like we did
too good a job.

2341
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:52,349
Well, that's not a bad legacy
to leave.

2342
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,719
And now,

2343
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,994
I need you, Ron Stallworth,

2344
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:02,593
to destroy all evidence
of this investigation.

2345
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:05,997
- What?
- We prefer that the public

2346
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:09,157
never knew about this
investigation.

2347
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:10,350
Uh-huh.

2348
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:13,717
Cease all further contact
with the Ku Klux Klan,

2349
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:16,032
effective immediately.

2350
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,073
That goes for you, too, Flip.

2351
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,512
This is total horseshit.

2352
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:23,439
Fucking shenanigans.

2353
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:25,080
Aye, aye, Chief.

2354
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,034
Subterfuge.

2355
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:29,119
- Skulduggery.
- Hey, Ron.

2356
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,754
Take a week off.

2357
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:33,880
Take your girlfriend, Patrice,
on a vacation.

2358
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,679
Live it up a little.
You worked hard.

2359
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:39,390
When you come back, we can discuss
maybe a new assignment, Ron.

2360
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:42,119
How about Narcotics?

2361
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:03,269
<i>Mr. Duke, I'm so sorry we didn't get to
spend more one-on-one time together.</i>

2362
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,159
<i>Well, that was a...</i>

2363
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,436
<i>Just a tragedy.</i>

2364
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:13,037
I had just met those heroic
brothers in the cause.

2365
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:17,760
"Heroic."

2366
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,469
Yeah.

2367
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:22,994
And the chapter
is just shaken at the core.

2368
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:24,879
- Oh.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

2369
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,440
<i>And poor Connie, right?</i>

2370
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:28,936
<i>I mean, not only does she
lose her husband, but...</i>

2371
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:30,280
Poor Connie.

2372
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:31,953
She's looking at
serious prison time.

2373
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,997
- Connie's going away.
- We feel bad for Connie.

2374
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:35,509
My God.

2375
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:39,393
And then there was that
nigger detective.

2376
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:41,120
<i>Basically...</i>

2377
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,840
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Shut up, shut up.

2378
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:46,552
Those goddamn coloreds.

2379
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:49,336
They sure know
how to spoil a celebration.

2380
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:50,680
Hey, you're getting me
in trouble.

2381
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:52,280
Christ,
you can say that again.

2382
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:54,955
Those goddamn coloreds

2383
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,152
<i>sure know
how to spoil a celebration.</i>

2384
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:59,392
<i>Can I ask you a question, sir?</i>

2385
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:01,155
Shoot.

2386
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:05,680
That nigger detective, did you ever...
Did you ever get his name?

2387
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,717
No. I don't think I...

2388
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:10,360
Are you sure you don't know
who he is?

2389
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:17,876
Are you absolutely sure?

2390
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:22,518
'Cause that nigga, coon,
gator bait,

2391
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:26,514
spade, spook, Sambo,
spear-chucking jungle bunny,

2392
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:28,592
Mississippi wind chime...

2393
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,433
- Wind chime?
- Detective...

2394
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:33,433
Is Ron Stallworth,
you racist, peckerwood,

2395
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:37,480
redneck, inch worm,
needle-dick motherfucker!

2396
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:42,230
Oh!

2397
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:44,039
I'll be here all week.

2398
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:16,760
What are you doing?

2399
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:18,156
Nothing.

2400
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:19,720
Finishing up.

2401
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:23,792
Have you handed in
your resignation from the KKK?

2402
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:25,075
Affirmative.

2403
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:27,313
Have you handed in your
resignation

2404
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:29,517
from the Colorado Springs
Police Department?

2405
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:33,034
Negative.

2406
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:37,669
Truth be told, Patrice,
I always wanted to be a cop,

2407
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:41,352
and I'm still for
the liberation of my people.

2408
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:44,917
My conscience won't let me
sleep with the enemy.

2409
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,275
Enemy?

2410
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,392
No, I'm the black man
that saved your life.

2411
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:49,994
- You're absolutely right.
- Right.

2412
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:52,390
And I thank you for it,
but...

2413
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:54,359
I can't do this.

2414
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:58,397
I think we should...
We should talk.

2415
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,074
It's okay. It's okay.

2416
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:07,920
I said it's...

2417
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:17,629
<i>Blood and soil!
Blood and soil!</i>

2418
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:19,154
<i>Blood and soil!</i>

2419
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:27,631
Jews will not
replace us!

2420
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:30,799
Jews will not replace us!

2421
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:33,680
Jews will not replace us!

2422
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:43,080
White lives matter! White lives matter!
White lives matter!

2423
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:47,393
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

2424
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:08,634
What the fuck, man?

2425
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:10,598
You had a group on one side
that was bad,

2426
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:14,230
and you had a group on the other side
that was also very violent.

2427
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:15,959
Nazis, go home!

2428
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:19,590
<i>Not all of those people
were neo-Nazis, believe me.</i>

2429
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:22,354
<i>Not all of those people
were white supremacists.</i>

2430
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:26,878
You also had people
that were very fine people.

2431
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:30,158
Because I believe that today
in Charlottesville,

2432
02:07:30,640 --> 02:07:35,556
this is a first step
toward making a realization

2433
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:39,873
of something that Trump alluded to
earlier in the campaign, which is...

2434
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:44,512
This is the first step
toward taking America back.

2435
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:49,516
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

2436
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:51,711
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

2437
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,274
Holy shit!

2438
02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:59,639
Holy shit!

2439
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:16,033
I had to jump out of the way.

2440
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:18,396
I almost got hit by the car
my fucking self.

2441
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:23,514
There are people, bodies laying
on the ground right now.

2442
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:25,876
Oh, my God!
We got hit by a car!

2443
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:28,873
And there was a woman, uh,
laying there, hardly breathing,

2444
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:31,919
and we ended up
rolling her over, and she died.

2445
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,550
This is my town! We did not
want them motherfuckers here!
