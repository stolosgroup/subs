Whoo!

I know.

24
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:20,439
I keep waiting for, like,

the bubble to burst
or something.

26
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,740
No, no, there's no trick here.

27
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,709
We got lucky.

28
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:28,315
We should just be grateful.

29
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,713
You know, sometimes
this happens, you know?

30

People get lucky.
Yeah.

I love you.

It's a second chance
for us, isn't it?

34
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:49,930
Mmm, yeah.

35
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:57,267
Hmm.
We should split it.

36
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:59,841
- Split it?
- Yeah, the money.

37
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:03,075
It would be easier,
don't you think?

38
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,913
A prenup?

39
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:07,420
That means
you'd have to propose,

40
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,049
Michael,
for that to be the case.

41
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,366
What are you gonna do
with your half?

42
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:23,161
I am gonna never think
about money ever again.

43
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,767
Seriously?

44
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:26,296
I mean,
what's the point of having

45
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:27,550
that kind of money
if you're ever going to worry

46
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:29,068
about it again, you know?

47
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:33,237
Come on.

48
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:36,647
I don't know.

49
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:41,179
I'm gonna... I'm gonna make art,
you know, real art,

50
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,785
art that doesn't give a shit

51
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,216
if it offends
the fragile sensibilities

52
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,394
of some housewife in Orlando.

53
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:49,187
- Come on.
- I know.

54
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,529
You know what I'm going to do?

55
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:53,125
I'm going to give
the downtrodden a voice.

56
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,699
I am going to bankroll
the Red Cross.

57
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,536
I'm gonna hire Necker Island

58
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:00,033
and have Steve Aoki
play at my private party.

59
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,233
I'm gonna start schools
for the villagers in Zimbabwe.

60
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,641
And you know what?

61
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:06,842
I'm gonna smoke
a fat blunt with Elon Musk

62
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:10,175
as we take his little
rocket ship deep into space,

63
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,079
and I'm gonna do it all twice.

64
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:16,181
I'm gonna invest.

65
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,589
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:21,758
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

67
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:23,529
Ugh.

68
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:25,256
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh.

69
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,159
Come on,
let's go check the place out.

70
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,435
- Oh.
- Ah!

71
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,537
Come on.

72
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:35,937
So I guess this would be
the master bedroom.

73
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:39,072
Wow, okay.

74
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:43,417
It's all very white.

75
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:47,344
I mean, is this for real?

76
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,390
All we have to do
is stay here for 50 days?

77
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:52,789
Yeah.

78
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,475
What do you want to do?

79
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:19,420
Just... there's no TV.

80
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:27,659
Mmm.

81
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:38,065
Wow, rub-a-dub-dub.

Yeah, maybe.

Okay.

That's not too early for you?

107
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:08,754
Mm, you can set it

Hmm, what?

I just don't think
it's a good idea.

123

00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:19,220
- Him.
- Him.

- Voyan?
- Voyan.

131
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,493
I mean, the room is pitch black.

132
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,868
Nobody can see anything.

133
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,368
I know,
but it still feels weird.

00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,010
Hmm.

135
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:42,243
But if we're very, very quiet,

136
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,311
we can try under the covers.

137
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:46,016

Oh.

- Hmm.
- Breakfast?

160
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:35,356
Mm, yummy.

161
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:37,688
Any bets on
what we're having for lunch?

The documentary.

00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:00,711
I sent you the link.
Remember?

168
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:05,320
- No.
- Oh... oh, my gosh.

169
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:06,717
What?

170
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,971
No, that's just... it's...
This is...

171
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,689
That's the whole thing.

172
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,197
"Fame" was a documentary
that he made.

173
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:17,002
Voyan found
some blue collar family

174
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,696
in middle America.

175
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,303
You know, the dad was a pastor.
The mom did bake sales.

176
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,041
The kids went to
the only school in town,

177
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:27,705
and then he spent
$150 million to see

178
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,741
what would happen if he made
them Kardashian, like, famous.

179
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,052
You know,
paid Hollywood publicists,

180
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:36,054
advertising agencies,
stylists, the works.

181
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:37,484
Wow.

182
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,321
Yeah, didn't go too well.

183
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:43,424
I mean, well,
it did in the beginning.

184
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,899
The kids got huge
modeling contracts.

185
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,000
The dad guest starred
on sitcoms,

186
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,761
or commercials, or TV shows,

187
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,072
and the mom became
a spokesperson for oatmeal

188
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:57,240
or something like that,
but then it didn't.

189
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:59,836
She shot him after finding him
in bed with another woman

190
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:03,114
and went to jail for murder.
Yeah.

191
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,512
The son fell off the planet,
just disappeared,

192
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:08,515
and the daughter
ended up OD'ing on heroin.

193
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,748
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

194
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,222
- That's heavy.
- Mm.

195
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:18,129
- But why do that?
- No one knows.

196
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:21,363
All anyone knows about him is
he's got more money than God

197
00:14:21,398 --> 00:14:23,629
and there's a single interview
that he did

198
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:27,567
when he was a student
at Princeton 30 years ago,

199
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:29,767
or... where he basically
just said he's intrigued

200
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,944
by the human condition.

201
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:33,947
How have you
not watched "Fame?"

202
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:40,316
- Sounds like a weirdo.
- Maybe.

203
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:42,153
Might be onto something though.

204
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:46,355
Yeah, well, not everyone's
so easily manipulated.

205
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:24,822
<i>It is midday.</i>

206
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,890
<i>Enjoy your stay
in the Immaculate Room.</i>

207
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,203
Hey, Kate, it's midday.

208
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:39,177
Sure it is.

209
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,841
Nope.

210
00:15:54,062 --> 00:15:57,723
White is like...

211
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:01,727
the absence of color,
nothingness.

212
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:05,401
I think I hate white.

213
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,538
- It's like watching the clock.
- Yeah.

214
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:12,639
You shouldn't watch the clock
like that, you know?

215
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,774
- I hate that clock.
- Don't stare at it.

216
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,713
It actually went backwards,
not for long,

217
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:21,813
just for a few seconds,

218
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,816
and then it went forwards again.

219
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,687
Don't stare at the clock.

220
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:29,722
And I also think
that the seconds are longer

221
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:33,165
than normal, like,
maybe 1.3 seconds

222
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,563
longer than normal seconds.

223
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,367
50 days could turn out to be...

224
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:38,775
I don't know how long...
Three months?

225
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,931
I mean, how will we know?

226
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,911
Day two is a little too early
for conspiracy theories,

227
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,572
I think.

228
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:46,904
And the light changes
to simulate nature, you know,

229
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,675
cue the sun-type stuff.

230
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,009
I mean, how will we know what
they're really all about here?

231
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:55,088
<i>It is evening.</i>

232
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:57,453
<i>Enjoy your stay

233
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:59,554
Okay, now they're
just messing with me.

234
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:02,293
10:00, time for bed.

235
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:05,329
Not really a suggestion, I see.

236
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:10,994
Ugh.

237
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:23,974
Is there anything
in the manual about

238
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:28,748
if we have to brush our teeth
clockwise or counterclockwise?

239
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:34,787
No, 'cause you know, I'd hate
to have the toothbrush police

240
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,822
kicking the door on me
while I'm in the bathroom,

241
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:38,527
because I got it wrong.

242
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:47,371
Hey, $5 million, babe.

243
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,311
Keep your eye on the prize.

244
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,363
<i>Good morning, Kate.</i>

Today will be filled

248
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,961
I visualize my life

249
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,503
filled with success
and positivity.

250

00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,487
Hey.
Hm.

257
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,686
You got this, right?

258
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:16,394
- Mm.
- Yeah, you got this.

259
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:18,154
Come on.

260
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:21,564
Up and at 'em
and into the shower, handsome.

261
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,202
This and then clap.

262
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:44,917

Hey there, little fella.

276
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,249
What are you doing there?

277
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:03,660
Yeah.
Huh.

278
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:06,597
Where you going, big guy?

279
00:22:06,632 --> 00:22:09,358
There's nothing here, sorry.

280
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:12,163
You know, they call this place
the Immaculate Room,

281
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:15,034
but it's really the nothing room

282
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,410
because there's
nothing here, you see?

283

I mean, like, nothing.

284
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,042
- What is it?
- This is Cluey.

285
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:26,749
He hasn't a clue where he is.

286
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,755
Not gonna last long

00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,790
Mm.

288
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:40,400
You just wait right here.
I'll take care of you.

289
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:57,373

298
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,397
I can't feed the bug
some of my breakfast

299
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:23,806
because it's not a contestant?

300
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:26,171
A little draconian,
don't you think?

301
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:34,146
I need to let him outside.
He's just gonna die in here.

I don't think it's
a two-way kind of thing.

I think it's, like,
sensor automated or something.

Okay, look, on the record,
I don't want to leave.

But if you push the button,
you're out.

00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:28,464
Oh, here we go.

327
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:31,170
You know...

328
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:34,305
Compassion's never been
your strong suit.

329
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,713
What is that supposed to mean?

330
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:37,847
Well, you know.

331
00:24:37,882 --> 00:24:41,378
Oh, my God, all this
because I'm not a vegan?

332
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,512
Are you kidding me?

333
00:24:43,547 --> 00:24:44,865
You know, your diet
has made you just

334
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:46,317
a little bit intolerant, Mikey.

335
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,890
- Intolerant?
- Yes.

336
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:49,397
Because I think
it's better to try and kill

337
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,257
as few things as possible?
People need to eat.

338
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:55,260
Well, you can live just fine
without killing things.

339
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:56,998
Oh, can you?
Huh.

340
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,505
How many times have you
been sick this year?

341
00:24:58,529 --> 00:24:59,946
Okay, that has nothing
to do with anything.

342
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,178
It has everything to do with it.

343
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:02,839
You're malnourished,
and you're sickly,

344
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:04,511
and that's only because
the word "vegan" is trending.

345
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:05,875
- Wow, wow.
- So cool.

346
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,349
- The lengths...
- You're so cool, Mikey.

347
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,779
You go to justify yourself.

348
00:25:08,814 --> 00:25:10,517
At least be honest, you know,
start with the truth

349
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,189
and then move on from there.
Oh, honesty?

350
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:13,421
That's rich.
You want to talk about honesty?

351
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,620
Sure.

352
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:15,895
The only reason you're a vegan

353
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,590
is because you want
to piss off daddy,

354
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,025
and why do you want
to piss him off?

355
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:21,187
Because he made
the terrible mistake

356
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:23,090
of giving you
everything you've ever needed,

357
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,928
and that means you've
never really suffered,

358
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:27,864
which then strips you
of your whole little

359
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:29,899
artsy street cred thing.

360
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:31,967
So just give us
all a break, Banksy.

361
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:43,748
Oh, I'm sorry.

362
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:46,245
It was an accident.

363
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,115
It was, Mikey.

364
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,479
Oh.

365
00:26:12,174 --> 00:26:13,646
I'm gonna take a treat.

366
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:19,817
I read in the rules that
we can each take up to two.

367
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:21,346
Read the rules.

368
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,153
You know, this isn't natural,

369
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:28,958
doing nothing like this.

370
00:26:28,993 --> 00:26:31,323
Before you go thinking
this is indulgent, it's not.

371
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:34,293
This is what healthy people do.
They do stuff.

372
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:36,163
It's $100,000.

373
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:37,835
It comes out of the prize money.

374
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:42,708
We're barely halfway through.

375
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:43,951
That's what these treats
are for,

376
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:45,205
to help us get through this.

377
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:51,013
You don't even know what it is.

378
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:54,445
I'll take anything other
than this suffocating boredom.

379
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,349
I mean, what's 100,000
of $5 million.

380
00:26:57,384 --> 00:27:00,352
I mean, it's nothing.

381
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:02,354
It's $100,000.

382
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:04,521
<i>It is midday.</i>

383
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,897
<i>Enjoy your stay
in the Immaculate Room.</i>

384
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:13,200
Are you asking my permission?

385
00:27:15,006 --> 00:27:16,335
No.

386
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:32,434
This is coming out
of your half, not mine.

387
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:57,706
He spent $100,000
on a green crayon.

388
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,610
What about me?

389
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:12,957
You've never drawn me.

390
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:16,994
Yeah, okay.

391
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:22,329
Where should I pose?

392
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:24,331
Um, just over here.
Here, come on.

393
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
All right, you comfortable?
Mmhmm.

394
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:29,875
Okay.

395
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,813
Are you gonna do it realistic?

396
00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:47,222
Somewhat.

397
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:48,828
Do it realistic.

398
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:53,723
It'll be the real you.

399
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:58,167
What does that mean?

400
00:29:58,202 --> 00:30:01,907
Well, I'll try
and capture your essence.

401
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:08,705
Can't you just do
a straight portrait?

402
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,379
That's boring.

403
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:14,315
You see yourself
in the mirror every day.

404
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,558
You know,
why just do another version

405
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:16,845
of the same thing?

406
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,253
This will be way
more interesting.

407
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:23,258
I've just never
had a portrait done before.

408
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,030
I don't do that.

409
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:31,035
Don't or can't?

410
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,242
It's okay.

411
00:30:40,277 --> 00:30:42,317
I'm not really comfortable
here on the floor anyway.

412
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:48,601
I'm sorry.

413
00:32:55,082 --> 00:32:56,774
I've been a real bitch.

414
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:03,187
It's okay.

415
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,328
It's...

416
00:33:12,363 --> 00:33:14,858
harder than I thought.

417
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,400
Yeah.

418
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,866
Way harder.

419
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:36,055
We only have 20 days left.

420
00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:40,323
We... we can do this.

421
00:34:31,772 --> 00:34:33,112
Mikey.

422
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,181
Michael!

423
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:38,282
What is it?

424
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:41,076
What?

425
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:44,112
What is it?
Oh, what the...?

426
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:46,653
I don't like this.
I don't like this.

427
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,490
Do you think it's loaded?
I don't know.

428
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:49,755
- Check!
- What?

429
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,965
I don't want
to start messing with it.

430
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,088
What if it
accidentally goes off?

431
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:55,728
- How'd it get in here?
- I don't know.

432
00:34:58,128 --> 00:35:01,602
- Get rid of it.
- Where?

433
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:04,704
I don't know.
The laundry chute?

434
00:35:06,246 --> 00:35:08,147
<i>The laundry chute
is for clothing only.</i>

435
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:22,887
They're just messing
with us, right?

436
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:24,053
Definitely.

437
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,562
Yeah.

438
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,052
<i>Connect is about to start.</i>

439
00:35:57,594 --> 00:36:00,397
Kate!

440
00:36:00,432 --> 00:36:02,432
It's the connect.
Connect?

441
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,533
Yeah, oh, it's...

442
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:06,502
It's a message
from a family member.

443
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:08,735
I didn't... I didn't know
about this.

444
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,770
Yeah.

445
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,245
<i>Connect for Michael Walsh.</i>

446
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:18,008
<i>Yo, big bro, what are you doing?</i>

447
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,449
Oh, Q.

448
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:21,880
<i>What is this
crazy room business?</i>

449
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:24,421
<i>Are you seriously

450

<i>in a white room

<i>nothing for 50 days,</i>

454
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,729
<i>- There is no way...</i>
- She's so funny.

455
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:38,930
<i>You don't go batshit crazy.</i>

456
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:41,768
<i>I mean, is this,
like, a detox from Kate?</i>

457
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:44,606
<i>Leaving her
was clearly the right thing,</i>

458
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:48,544
<i>but this room thing
might be a little extreme.</i>

459
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,040
I...

460
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,910
<i>- Anyway...</i>
- I have not talked to her.

461

<i>Yeah, but I'm kind of bored.

00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:11,726
- Kate, chill out.
- Make it stop!

487
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:13,563
Make it stop!
Are you serious?

488
00:38:13,598 --> 00:38:15,191
What's the matter?

489
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,478
<i>Maybe we can
get together sometime...</i>

490
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,963
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

491
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:19,536
- What's the matter?
- Get off of me!

492
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:22,902
- What's the...
<i>- When you finish this thing.</i>

493
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:25,575
<i>I'm doing okay.</i>

494
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,577
<i>I've been off the streets...</i>
Who is this?

495
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:29,205
<i>For a year now.</i>

496
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,209
<i>I'm living in a shelter,
St. Mary's.</i>

497
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,388
<i>Do you remember that song
I used to sing to you</i>

498
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:39,820
<i>when you had bad dreams?</i>

499
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:41,492
<i>♪ I love you ♪</i>

500
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:45,089
<i>♪ More than eternity ♪</i>

501
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:50,028
<i>♪ You're worth more
than gold to me ♪</i>

502
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:54,835
<i>♪ You and me
were meant to be ♪</i>

503
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,442
<i>♪ Oh, my love ♪</i>

504
00:38:57,477 --> 00:38:59,939
<i>♪ My love ♪</i>

505
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:03,272
<i>♪ Can't you see?</i>

506
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,747
No.

507
00:39:05,782 --> 00:39:10,114
<i>I love you, and good luck
with everything, Katie.</i>

508
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:14,052
No.

509
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:28,737
Hey, hey.

510
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,301
No!

511
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:40,243
No, please.

512
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:56,765
<i>Good morning, Kate.</i>

513
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
<i>This is your wake up call.</i>

514
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:01,473
<i>Enjoy your stay
in the Immaculate Room.</i>

515
00:40:33,804 --> 00:40:37,003
Um...

516
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:39,335
you, um... you gonna get up?

517
00:40:40,844 --> 00:40:42,404
No.

518
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:45,143
Okay.

519
00:40:47,587 --> 00:40:48,883
That was my father.

520
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:54,889
I haven't seen...

521
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:56,891
or heard from him in years.

522
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:04,833
I lied about him to you.

523
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:09,838
I've always been ashamed of him,

524
00:41:09,873 --> 00:41:12,577
and I know that's wrong,

525
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:15,173
but it's not so easy

526
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:18,473
to undo the shame...

527
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:21,916
of having a father...

528
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:25,656
who drank away your house...

529
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:30,155
and your school fees...

530
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,356
and any chance of
growing up a normal person.

531
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,770
I wasn't expecting to see him...

532
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:42,134
at St. Mary's.

533
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,710
It's a homeless shelter.

534
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:51,044
I know.
I... I drive by there.

535
00:41:54,082 --> 00:41:55,477
Seeing him brought things up...

536
00:42:00,055 --> 00:42:01,725
Things I thought
I was done with.

537
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:08,490
I love you.

538
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,803
I love you too.

539
00:42:45,298 --> 00:42:47,529
100% cotton.

540
00:42:49,137 --> 00:42:52,743
Cold wash.
Do not bleach.

541
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,306
Made in Bangladesh.

542
00:42:57,178 --> 00:43:00,652
100% cotton.

543
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:03,017
Cold wash.
Do not bleach.

544
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,120
Made in Bangladesh.

545
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,521
100% cotton.

546
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,622
Cold wash.

547
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:17,669
Do not bleach!

548
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:23,807
100% cotton.

549
00:43:23,842 --> 00:43:26,139
Cold wash!

550
00:43:26,174 --> 00:43:28,746
Do not bleach.

551
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:32,310
Made in Bangladesh.

552
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:40,384
[]

553
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:09,787
Hey, you want lunch?

554
00:44:14,024 --> 00:44:15,683
No?

555
00:44:15,718 --> 00:44:20,061
Well, maybe I could interest
you in our specials today.

556
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:23,394
For the main course,
we've got smoked nothing

557
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:26,562
with a side of nothing
with some hints

558
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,300
of aromatic nothing.

559
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:15,083
<i>It is evening.</i>

560
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:17,250
<i>Enjoy your stay
in the Immaculate Room.</i>

561
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:47,984
<i>Good morning, Kate.</i>

562
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:50,085
<i>This is your wake up call.</i>

563
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,121
<i>Enjoy your stay
in the Immaculate Room.</i>

564
00:45:53,156 --> 00:45:54,683
Ah.

565
00:46:16,014 --> 00:46:19,477
Hey, how you doing?

566
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:31,588
Take a treat.

567
00:46:33,196 --> 00:46:34,899
It's worth it, Kate.

568
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:39,464
We've got 18 more days

569
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:41,730
of nothing.

570
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,369
That's a long time.

571
00:46:43,404 --> 00:46:46,537
It's a long, long time
of nothing.

572
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:51,080
Just this empty goddamn room
full of nothing.

573
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:57,548
Take a treat.

574
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,121
It'll help.

575
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:03,059
No, it's okay.

576
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:06,260
Really?

577
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,758
I'm fine.

578
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,905
You seem kind of checked out.

579
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,209
I'll shower,
make the bed, meditate.

580
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:27,710
I'll be fine.

581
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:39,392
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

582
00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:25,636
- Take another treat.
- Me?

583
00:48:25,671 --> 00:48:27,374
Yes, you.
Take it.

584
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:33,347
But I thought
you'd take a treat.

585
00:48:33,382 --> 00:48:35,118
I don't want a treat.

586
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:39,287
Come on.

587
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:43,027
I want you to take
your second treat.

588
00:48:45,493 --> 00:48:48,098
The next treat costs
a quarter of a million dollars.

589
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,462
I know.

590
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:57,800
- You sure?
- Take it.

591
00:48:57,835 --> 00:49:00,473
I'm gonna shower.

592
00:49:21,496 --> 00:49:24,398
Today is my day.

593
00:49:24,433 --> 00:49:26,202
Today, I will...

594
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:01,468
- Hey.
- Hi.

595
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:09,179
I'm Simone.

596
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,039
Um, hey, I'm...

597
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:13,777
I'm Mikey, uh...

598
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,420
Yeah.

599
00:50:22,722 --> 00:50:24,689
Hi.

600
00:50:24,724 --> 00:50:27,593
Kate, Kate, this is um...

601
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,432
Hey, Kate, I'm Simone.

602
00:50:33,095 --> 00:50:34,699
Hi.

603
00:50:34,734 --> 00:50:36,701
I... I... I got my second treat,

604
00:50:36,736 --> 00:50:40,111
and I thought
it was going to be...

605
00:50:40,146 --> 00:50:42,872
I mean, I didn't know,
and she just walked out.

606
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:47,745
So, like, what happens in here?

607
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,517
- You're not with them?
- With who?

608
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,785
The Immaculate Room.

609
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,051
The what room?

610
00:50:57,086 --> 00:50:59,625
The... the Immaculate Room.

611
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,166
You know, it's, like, on TV.

612
00:51:02,201 --> 00:51:04,762
50 days, and you win $5 million.

613
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:06,236
$5 million?

614
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,304
Come on, someone must
have told you something.

615
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:12,242
No, I mean, I'm an actress.
My agent got me the gig.

616
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,310
And there really
wasn't much detail.

617
00:51:14,345 --> 00:51:17,445
You know, they just made me
sign a bunch of NDAs

618
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,844
and told me to ad lib
whatever plays out.

619
00:51:20,879 --> 00:51:22,912
Seemed like
a challenge, you know?

620
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:24,947
Why not?

621
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:28,654
So how long are you here for?

622
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:30,524
They booked me for a month.

623
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:34,264
You're not wearing any clothes.

624
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,090
Nope.

625
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:38,235
They wanted full nudity
for some reason.

626
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:45,506
Well,
this is gonna be fun, right?

627
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,807
Give her your shirt.

628
00:51:49,842 --> 00:51:52,711
Yeah, sure.

629
00:51:52,746 --> 00:51:55,010
- Your shirt, Mikey, Jesus.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

630
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,947
Sorry, um...

631
00:51:57,982 --> 00:52:00,356
here you go.
It's kind of...

632
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:02,655
I mean, you... sorry,
you don't have to wear it,

633
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,986
if you don't want.
Thanks.

634
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,163
Oh, my God.

635
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:08,694
And they say chivalry is dead.

636
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:22,840
Wow, and this space

637
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,073
reminds me of this dance studio

638
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,647
that I used to go to in Paris.

639
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:29,715
You dance, Mikey?

640
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,356
I... I'm not the best answer,

641
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:36,557
but you know, Kate...
Kate used to dance, right?

642
00:52:36,592 --> 00:52:38,922
- Mm-hmm.
- Want to dance?

643
00:52:38,957 --> 00:52:42,992
- No.
- I did not know, okay?

644
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:44,444
I pushed the button.
I got my second treat.

645
00:52:44,468 --> 00:52:45,896
I thought it was going to be...

646
00:52:45,931 --> 00:52:47,106
I don't know what I thought
it was going to be.

647
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,031
The last treat
was a freakin' crayon, okay?

648
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:50,670
She just walked out.

649
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:52,837
Well, she's here.

650
00:52:52,872 --> 00:52:55,873
So what are we gonna do?

651
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:01,142
I don't know, Michael.
This is your treat.

652
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:10,228
This is good.

653
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:13,891
You did this?

654
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:18,434
Yeah.

655
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:21,503
It's Kate, right?

656
00:53:24,475 --> 00:53:25,870
Yeah.

657
00:53:25,905 --> 00:53:28,136
- You make a great model, Kate.
- Mm.

658
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,042
It's actually African...

659
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:35,517
African cubist, I know.

660
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:41,149
- Michael.
- Yes, dear?

661
00:53:43,626 --> 00:53:46,363
Can you come here?
Of course.

662
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:56,670
- Sit.
- Yeah.

663
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:04,106
So how is this all going
to work out with her?

664
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:07,241
I mean, I'm sure
it'll be fine, you know?

665
00:54:07,276 --> 00:54:11,355
It's like... it's cool.

666
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:13,324
It's cool?

667
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,327
No, this is all
a little ridiculous.

668
00:54:16,362 --> 00:54:17,823
How can you say it's just fine?

669
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:19,341
This random person
ends up in this room.

670
00:54:19,365 --> 00:54:20,958
Like who do we...
It's not cool.

671
00:54:20,993 --> 00:54:22,663
I don't know.
This is terrible.

672
00:54:22,698 --> 00:54:24,764
It is terrible.
We don't even know who she is.

673
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:26,634
I don't buy this whole
actress thing.

674
00:54:26,669 --> 00:54:29,373
I don't trust her.
I mean, do you?

675
00:54:29,408 --> 00:54:32,134
Michael?
Mmhmm.

676
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:34,840
I think the best way
to deal with...

677
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,171
<i>It is evening.</i>

678
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,514
<i>Enjoy your stay
in the Immaculate Room.</i>

679
00:54:38,549 --> 00:54:40,780
- Hello?
- Over here.

680
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:42,683
- No, ugh.
- No, the...

681
00:54:42,718 --> 00:54:44,113
Oh, my God.

682
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:46,016
The... the lights
turn out at 10:00

683
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:50,317
every night automatically.
It's really annoying actually.

684
00:54:50,352 --> 00:54:51,923
What, no party?

685
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:55,630
Hm.

686
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:57,797
No guest suite either,
I imagine.

687
00:54:57,832 --> 00:54:58,832
Nope.

688
00:55:00,604 --> 00:55:02,131
Why don't you two
sleep on the bed?

689
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,671
I'll just sleep on the floor.

690
00:55:03,706 --> 00:55:06,641
Oh, don't be crazy.
It's a concrete floor.

691
00:55:06,676 --> 00:55:09,039
Okay, I'll stay awake.

692
00:55:09,074 --> 00:55:11,074
You know, I'm sure they'll
buzz me out soon enough.

693
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,846
They said that?

694
00:55:13,881 --> 00:55:15,342
They would just buzz you out?

695
00:55:15,377 --> 00:55:17,179
Well, I had to commit
to a month,

696
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:19,247
but my agent
said it was probably

697
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,388
just gonna be a day gig.
Oh.

698
00:55:24,463 --> 00:55:27,321
Well, we can all
sleep in the bed.

699
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:29,829
I mean, there's enough room.

700
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:33,998
It'd be silly for you just
to be walking around the place.

701
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:36,869
Yeah?
Okay, cool.

702
00:55:36,904 --> 00:55:38,772
All right, well then...
Oh, sorry.

703
00:55:39,973 --> 00:55:41,445
- Oh.
- Sorry.

704
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,580
All right.

705
00:55:44,615 --> 00:55:46,450
I'm going to the bathroom.

706
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:57,923
I have to go
to the bathroom too.

707
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:00,255
I'll be right back.

708
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,630
Hey.

709
00:56:01,665 --> 00:56:03,093
- Jesus.
- Are you OK?

710
00:56:03,128 --> 00:56:05,568
- Yes, I'm fine.
- I can sleep on the floor.

711
00:56:05,603 --> 00:56:06,767
I don't mind, really.

712
00:56:06,802 --> 00:56:08,472
Don't make this weird.

713
00:56:08,507 --> 00:56:10,232
Just sleep in the bed.

714
00:56:19,914 --> 00:56:23,278
I, uh, set a 7:00 a.m.
wake up call.

715
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,719
Sorry if that's early.

716
00:56:24,754 --> 00:56:25,951
Hey, no, this is your thing.

717
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,929
Um...

718
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:42,803
Just get in.

719
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:44,805
All right.

720
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,349
Good night.

721
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:03,593
Good night.

722
00:57:39,257 --> 00:57:41,026
<i>Good morning, Kate.</i>

723
00:57:41,061 --> 00:57:42,863
<i>This is your wake up call.</i>

724
00:57:42,898 --> 00:57:45,668
<i>Enjoy your stay
in the Immaculate Room.</i>

725
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:14,631
She's gone.

726
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:30,339
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, Jesus.

727
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:32,110
Sorry, I didn't...
I can come back later.

728
00:58:32,145 --> 00:58:34,948
- I'm done.
- Okay, great.

729
00:58:34,983 --> 00:58:37,082
Thank you.

730
00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:39,755
Oh, my God.

731
00:58:51,065 --> 00:58:52,262
Waterfall.

732
00:58:52,297 --> 00:58:53,868
I don't think
it's, like, massive.

733
00:58:53,903 --> 00:58:56,772
Oh, come on.

734
00:58:56,807 --> 00:58:57,971
Yeah.

735
00:59:01,812 --> 00:59:03,306
I'm gonna take a treat.

736
00:59:05,013 --> 00:59:09,246
Uh, yeah, great.

737
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:10,885
What's a treat?

738
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,920
Oh, Jesus, you're a treat.

739
00:59:12,955 --> 00:59:17,793
We each get up to two
during our stay.

740
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:30,333
What?

741
00:59:35,043 --> 00:59:36,405
It's ecstasy.

742
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,177
Nice!

743
00:59:51,862 --> 00:59:53,664
You want it?

744
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:55,028
Thank you.

745
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,774
Maybe you should
sit this one out.

746
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,974
What?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

747
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:09,636
Come on, Mikey.
It'll be a blast.

748
01:00:09,671 --> 01:00:11,682
Come on.
We all have to do it.

749
01:00:11,717 --> 01:00:12,749
Mikey.

750
01:00:18,317 --> 01:00:20,185
You're a big boy.

751
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,253
Your decision.

752
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:27,956
Mm, so pretty.

753
01:03:31,543 --> 01:03:34,049
- Michael, Michael, stop!
- No, drowning!

754
01:03:34,084 --> 01:03:35,710
Michael, stop please.
Michael stop!

755
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,679
He's drowning!

756
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:39,197
Michael, please stop.
Please stop, please.

757
01:03:39,221 --> 01:03:41,320
It's not real.
It's just a bad trip.

758
01:03:41,355 --> 01:03:43,190
It's not real.
It's not real, baby.

759
01:03:43,225 --> 01:03:44,829
It's nothing.
You're just hallucinating.

760
01:03:44,853 --> 01:03:47,755
I saw...
I saw Shawn under water.

761
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,691
No, no, no, no.
It's okay, baby.

762
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:51,033
It's okay.

763
01:03:51,068 --> 01:03:52,397
It's not okay.
It's not okay.

764
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:54,399
I gotta get out of here.
No, no, no, no.

765
01:03:54,434 --> 01:03:56,071
Mikey, Mikey, Michael,
no, no, no, no.

766
01:03:56,106 --> 01:03:57,941
Look at me.
Look, I got you, baby.

767
01:03:57,976 --> 01:03:59,173
I got you.

768
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:00,350
I am gonna
take care of you, okay?

769
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:02,275
Don't worry.
Don't worry, it's fine.

770
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:05,839
Michael, think about the money.
I want to leave here.

771
01:04:05,874 --> 01:04:07,060
I don't want to be here anymore.

772
01:04:07,084 --> 01:04:08,380
Don't worry.
No, no, no, no.

773
01:04:08,415 --> 01:04:10,217
I don't care about the money.
I don't care.

774
01:04:10,252 --> 01:04:11,614
Come here.
Come here.

775
01:04:11,649 --> 01:04:13,682
Shh, sit down.
Sit down.

776
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:15,959
- I saw...
- I love you.

777
01:04:15,994 --> 01:04:17,587
Sit down.
I miss him so much.

778
01:04:17,622 --> 01:04:19,391
Lay down.
Lay down.

779
01:04:19,426 --> 01:04:21,459
There, there, there, there.
Good.

780
01:04:21,494 --> 01:04:23,197
I'm so sorry.

781
01:04:23,232 --> 01:04:25,067
It was just
an accident, Michael.

782
01:04:25,102 --> 01:04:27,135
It's not your fault.
It's all my fault.

783
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:29,863
- It's not your fault, baby.
- We shouldn't be here.

784
01:04:29,898 --> 01:04:35,143
I know.
It's okay, shh, shh.

785
01:04:35,178 --> 01:04:37,409
It's okay.
I miss Shawn.

786
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:39,774
I know.
I know.

787
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,149
I know.

788
01:04:44,154 --> 01:04:46,154
Shh.

789
01:04:46,189 --> 01:04:48,453
That's good.
That's good.

790
01:04:53,493 --> 01:04:54,789
Who is Shawn?

791
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:58,562
Shawn...

792
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:05,767
Shawn is...

793
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:09,606
Was Mikey's brother.

794
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:11,641
He drowned.

795
01:05:11,676 --> 01:05:15,843
Mikey was looking after him
and walked away,

796
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:18,186
and he fell into the pool.

797
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:19,990
Mikey was high.

798
01:05:20,025 --> 01:05:22,520
He dove in, but...

799
01:05:24,623 --> 01:05:25,623
No.

800
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,033
Yeah.

801
01:05:35,073 --> 01:05:36,974
How'd you guys meet?

802
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:44,278
It was raining,

803
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:48,810
and I was at the park.

804
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:50,548
I had no umbrella.

805
01:05:52,981 --> 01:05:54,783
And he...

806
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:59,161
He asked me if he could
catch the raindrops

807
01:05:59,196 --> 01:06:00,591
so I didn't get wet.

808
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:06,960
- That's really sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

809
01:06:10,405 --> 01:06:11,725
I said, "Yeah, sure.
Go for it."

810
01:06:14,673 --> 01:06:17,641
Sure enough, there he was

811
01:06:17,676 --> 01:06:19,841
catching all the raindrops.

812
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:51,213
- Hey.
- Hey.

813
01:06:51,248 --> 01:06:54,040
How you doing?

814
01:06:54,075 --> 01:06:55,481
I feel terrible.

815
01:06:57,782 --> 01:06:59,122
Come sit.

816
01:07:15,734 --> 01:07:17,272
I, um...

817
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:23,146
I had a younger brother.

818
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,745
And...
Kate told me.

819
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,911
Mm.

820
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,361
My mom died when I was 12.

821
01:07:44,928 --> 01:07:46,268
We had this argument,

822
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:49,832
and she left.

823
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:53,536
Got in a car crash.

824
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,775
My heart just shattered
when I heard.

825
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,154
Two decades later,
I'm still trying

826
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:05,452
to pick up all the pieces.

827
01:08:09,854 --> 01:08:13,790
When somebody dies and...

828
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:17,992
everywhere you turn,
there's only...

829
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:21,468
pain...

830
01:08:21,503 --> 01:08:23,437
you really do realize that love

831
01:08:23,472 --> 01:08:26,902
is the only real balm.

832
01:08:31,975 --> 01:08:35,845
It's like...

833
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,045
love is the only real thing
of value.

834
01:08:40,753 --> 01:08:43,721
The only thing
we should really pursue.

835
01:08:46,561 --> 01:08:48,594
What are you doing in here then?

836
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:55,766
How much love
does 5 million buy?

837
01:09:03,545 --> 01:09:04,874
It's okay.

838
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:07,943
You gotta do what you gotta do.
Yeah.

839
01:09:09,947 --> 01:09:11,518
You're good.

840
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:30,867
You know, it's painful, I know,

841
01:09:30,902 --> 01:09:32,605
but it's good
to get that stuff out.

842
01:09:34,444 --> 01:09:35,444
It's better, right?

843
01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:38,380
What's going on here?

844
01:09:40,582 --> 01:09:42,945
Hey, you're up.

845
01:09:44,817 --> 01:09:47,180
What's going on
with the two of you?

846
01:09:47,215 --> 01:09:48,918
We're just talking.

847
01:09:52,561 --> 01:09:54,561
- Don't you have any class?
- Kate.

848
01:09:57,665 --> 01:09:59,632
Does it give you pleasure
to try and seduce

849
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:00,930
another woman's boyfriend?

850
01:10:00,965 --> 01:10:03,966
Kate, that's not
what's going on here.

851
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:05,407
Okay, then what
is going on here?

852
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:08,135
No, why don't you tell me
what is going on here.

853
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,137
We were talking.

854
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:12,579
Oh, do you always
hold hands when you talk?

855
01:10:12,614 --> 01:10:14,416
Wow.

856
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:16,583
Kate, Kate, she wasn't trying
to do anything, okay?

857
01:10:16,618 --> 01:10:17,914
She wasn't trying
to do anything.

858
01:10:17,949 --> 01:10:20,719
We're just talking
about Shawn and stuff.

859
01:10:20,754 --> 01:10:21,929
Yeah, I mean,
it's not healthy for him

860
01:10:21,953 --> 01:10:23,425
to keep that cooped up inside.

861
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,460
Oh, nice, so now
you're a stripper and a shrink.

862
01:10:25,495 --> 01:10:27,220
- Kate!
- I'm an actress.

863
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:29,057
Actress, stripper,
not much of a difference

864
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:30,509
when you get paid
to take your clothes off.

865
01:10:30,533 --> 01:10:32,060
You are kind.

866
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:33,666
Don't let her insecurities
taint you.

867
01:10:33,701 --> 01:10:34,832
Fuck you.

868
01:10:34,867 --> 01:10:36,999
You're insecure,
so you lash out.

869
01:10:37,034 --> 01:10:40,475
You really should work on that.
Oh, so now you know me.

870
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,972
You arrived here 12 hours ago.
It's pretty easy to see-

871
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:44,512
- Enough!
Enough!

872
01:10:44,547 --> 01:10:46,448
Okay?
Just... just stop!

873
01:10:46,483 --> 01:10:48,043
Just stop it!

874
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,122
It was probably nothing.
I'm sorry.

875
01:11:03,632 --> 01:11:06,501
Well, maybe it wasn't.

876
01:11:45,575 --> 01:11:47,333
Hey, you gonna be long?

877
01:11:51,713 --> 01:11:53,339
Hello?

878
01:12:34,756 --> 01:12:36,250
She's gone.

879
01:12:40,157 --> 01:12:42,289
I don't feel okay.

880
01:13:06,788 --> 01:13:08,788
Michael.

881
01:13:08,823 --> 01:13:09,823
What.

882
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:13,155
Come here.

883
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,961
Come here.

884
01:13:26,841 --> 01:13:28,445
What is that?

885
01:13:33,947 --> 01:13:35,749
I... I...
I don't know what to say.

886
01:13:35,784 --> 01:13:38,114
I mean, I didn't sleep with her.

887
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:40,820
You know who she looks like,
don't you?

888
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:42,822
You know who she looks like?
Olivia.

889
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:44,351
- Don't Kate.
- Your ex.

890
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:46,826
This is the room.
They're messing with you, okay?

891
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:48,168
They chose someone
that looked like her

892
01:13:48,192 --> 01:13:49,532
to get this reaction out of you.

893
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,600
Out of me?
You're the one who screwed her.

894
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:53,140
I swear, okay?
I didn't sleep with her.

895
01:13:53,164 --> 01:13:54,339
I mean,
I'm not getting laid anyway.

896
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:55,802
You're such a liar!

897
01:13:57,542 --> 01:14:00,939
Oh, my God.
Michael, Michael, you okay?

898
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:04,547
Are you okay?
Look at me.

899
01:14:04,582 --> 01:14:07,550
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, baby.

900
01:14:07,585 --> 01:14:09,948
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

901
01:14:09,983 --> 01:14:12,654
It was an accident.

902
01:14:12,689 --> 01:14:15,316
I'm sorry.

903
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:19,353
Have I even been unfaithful
to you ever?

904
01:14:20,862 --> 01:14:22,796
Even when you moved to New York?

905
01:14:22,831 --> 01:14:24,061
No.

906
01:14:24,096 --> 01:14:25,326
I did everything I could

907
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:27,867
to make you feel happy
and secure.

908
01:14:27,902 --> 01:14:29,495
<i>It is midday.</i>

909
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,035
<i>Enjoy your stay...</i>
Shut up!

910
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:32,366
<i>In the Immaculate Room.</i>

911
01:14:34,535 --> 01:14:38,075
I stopped seeing
my so-called rich friends

912
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:40,308
because you felt uncomfortable.

913
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:42,849
I didn't go
to ArtLab at St. Thomas

914
01:14:42,884 --> 01:14:44,752
'cause you were
feeling depressed.

915
01:14:44,787 --> 01:14:47,557
And what do I get in return?

916
01:14:47,592 --> 01:14:50,516
Gratitude?
Kindness?

917
01:14:50,551 --> 01:14:53,486
- I know.
- No, you're just jealous.

918
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:55,389
No.

919
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:58,733
Whatever chance we had...
Mikey.

920
01:14:58,768 --> 01:15:01,703
Mikey!
My God.

921
01:15:01,738 --> 01:15:05,872
Hey, look at me.
We have to get out of here.

922
01:15:05,907 --> 01:15:08,072
Just wait.
Just wait, wait, wait.

923
01:15:08,107 --> 01:15:09,238
Wait here.

924
01:15:15,213 --> 01:15:17,719
Here.
Here, put that.

925
01:15:17,754 --> 01:15:19,314
Put this, please.

926
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:24,594
Drink.

927
01:15:24,629 --> 01:15:26,453
Drink this.

928
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:29,027
You need the sugar.
Good.

929
01:15:29,062 --> 01:15:31,931
Good.
Drink more.

930
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:35,429
- I need a doctor.
- Drink a little more.

931
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,640
That's good.
That's good.

932
01:15:37,675 --> 01:15:39,576
- I need a doctor.
- Okay.

933
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:43,107
The bleeding's stopping,
Michael.

934
01:15:43,142 --> 01:15:45,109
We don't...
What if it doesn't stop?

935
01:15:45,144 --> 01:15:49,113
- Well, it will.
- No, no, I need a doctor.

936
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:52,083
We don't have allowance for
medical intervention, Michael.

937
01:15:52,118 --> 01:15:55,086
Remember, we read it.
It was in the contract.

938
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:58,287
They'll forfeit us.
We can't.

939
01:15:58,322 --> 01:16:00,289
But come on, let's lean you
against the wall.

940
01:16:00,324 --> 01:16:02,027
Come on.

941
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:05,734
Come on.
We got it.

942
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:06,834
We got this, Michael.

943
01:16:06,869 --> 01:16:10,299
Yeah, there, there.
Good.

944
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:13,170
See?
We're fine.

945
01:16:13,205 --> 01:16:15,172
It's gonna be fine.

946
01:16:15,207 --> 01:16:17,944
Yeah, it's stopping.
Michael, it's stopping.

947
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:20,683
The bleeding is... is done.
It's done.

948
01:16:20,718 --> 01:16:21,849
We're fine.

949
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:28,856
You don't care, do you?

950
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:32,794
What?

951
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,897
How far would you go?

952
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,461
What are you talking about?

953
01:16:42,201 --> 01:16:44,003
You'd let me bleed out
for the money.

954
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:48,535
No.

955
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:52,979
- No?
- No, that's not true.

956
01:16:53,014 --> 01:16:55,751
That is not true.
Then leave here with me.

957
01:16:57,645 --> 01:17:01,515
Michael, you're not even
thinking right, your head.

958
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,617
Can't you see what this place
has done to us?

959
01:17:04,652 --> 01:17:07,554
- No.
- How far would you have gone?

960
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:10,964
How far would you have gone
if I'd passed out?

961
01:17:10,999 --> 01:17:14,704
How long would you have waited?
It's not even true.

962
01:17:14,739 --> 01:17:17,234
Look what this place
has done to us.

963
01:17:17,269 --> 01:17:18,532
We have to leave here.

964
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:22,173
Michael, we are so close.
We are so close.

965
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:26,210
Kate, this is how we win.
We leave.

966
01:17:26,245 --> 01:17:29,114
- No, no.
- Yeah.

967
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:37,419
This place, this room...

968
01:17:37,454 --> 01:17:41,258
it's not a room.
It's a mirror.

969
01:17:41,293 --> 01:17:45,834
That's Professor Voyan,
he set all this up to show us,

970
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:48,661
to test us morally, spiritually,

971
01:17:48,696 --> 01:17:51,202
and guess what.
We're failing.

972
01:17:51,237 --> 01:17:54,040
Money isn't gonna fix
our broken parts.

973
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:57,670
We don't have
to throw away the money

974
01:17:57,705 --> 01:17:59,782
to prove our love, Michael.

975
01:17:59,817 --> 01:18:01,762
You're forcing a choice
that we don't have to make.

976
01:18:01,786 --> 01:18:03,445
We're days...

977
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:08,351
We've become sick and small
and afraid for money, Kate.

978
01:18:08,386 --> 01:18:10,353
It's easy to walk away
from something

979
01:18:10,388 --> 01:18:11,959
that you have had all your life.

980
01:18:11,994 --> 01:18:14,929
I'm...
Jeez, I know.

981
01:18:14,964 --> 01:18:18,196
I know.
It's easy to be afraid.

982
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:20,627
- Ugh!
- It's easy to be afraid.

983
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:23,531
But Kate, Kate,

984
01:18:23,566 --> 01:18:27,073
I am telling you this is wrong.

985
01:18:29,407 --> 01:18:30,945
It's over.
No.

986
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,881
- It's over.
- No.

987
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:35,444
Baby, we have to leave.

988
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:38,084
No, no, no.

989
01:18:38,119 --> 01:18:40,922
- You have to let it go.
- No.

990
01:18:40,957 --> 01:18:42,451
- Kate...
- You can't go.

991
01:18:42,486 --> 01:18:44,255
You have to leave with me, okay?

992
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:47,126
No.
Stay.

993
01:18:47,161 --> 01:18:48,831
Stay.

994
01:18:54,872 --> 01:18:57,730
I'm going...

995
01:18:57,765 --> 01:19:00,733
with you or without you.

996
01:19:00,768 --> 01:19:03,406
No, you can't go.
No, Michael.

997
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:05,672
Michael.
I'm leaving, Kate.

998
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,883
No, you can't go.

999
01:19:09,546 --> 01:19:12,448
I can because this is
the right thing to do.

1000
01:19:12,483 --> 01:19:14,857
No, you can't go!

1001
01:19:14,892 --> 01:19:17,651
Michael!
This is right.

1002
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:20,027
God, no!

1003
01:19:27,036 --> 01:19:29,300
Stop walking.

1004
01:19:29,335 --> 01:19:31,005
It's over, Kate.
I...

1005
01:19:32,371 --> 01:19:33,876
You can't leave.

1006
01:19:35,506 --> 01:19:37,605
I'm sorry it has come to this,

1007
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,476
but you are not
being rational, Michael.

1008
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:44,315
You gonna shoot me?

1009
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,123
You are not allowed
to just throw away

1010
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:53,995
millions of dollars!
It's wrong!

1011
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:58,395
- Don't do this.
- No!

1012
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:01,464
You!
You're the one doing this!

1013
01:20:01,499 --> 01:20:03,873
Don't ruin everything!

1014
01:20:05,338 --> 01:20:08,240
This isn't you.
It's the room.

1015
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:10,011
The room is doing this to you.

1016
01:20:10,046 --> 01:20:11,881
Don't let it change who you are.

1017
01:20:13,918 --> 01:20:17,117
It's over.
I'm sorry.

1018
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:21,517
You're wrong!
You're wrong, Michael!

1019
01:20:39,108 --> 01:20:40,701
Don't.

1020
01:20:42,408 --> 01:20:45,343
<i>Goodbye, Michael Walsh.</i>

1021
01:20:45,378 --> 01:20:48,445
<i>We hope you enjoyed your stay
in the Immaculate Room.</i>

1022

<i>The prize money will now drop

1023
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,437
Hey.

1024
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:41,133
- Michael.
- Kate.

1025
01:25:41,168 --> 01:25:44,411
Wow, this is a surprise.

1026
01:25:44,446 --> 01:25:46,006
Yeah, it's um...

1027
01:25:47,779 --> 01:25:49,218
It's been a while.

1028
01:25:50,617 --> 01:25:53,178
Yeah, it has.

1029
01:26:03,696 --> 01:26:07,335
I'm sorry for everything...

1030
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,238
back then.

1031
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:15,607
Well... I'm sorry too.

1032
01:26:15,642 --> 01:26:18,170
I'm actually visiting my dad.

1033
01:26:18,205 --> 01:26:20,249
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1034
01:26:20,284 --> 01:26:22,614
That's... that's great.

1035
01:26:27,753 --> 01:26:29,291
Well, I was just
headed to my car

1036
01:26:29,326 --> 01:26:31,260
if you want to walk with me,
catch up.

1037
01:26:31,295 --> 01:26:32,723
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1038
01:26:32,758 --> 01:26:34,329
Yeah.

1039
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:40,401
So, uh...

1040
01:26:40,436 --> 01:26:42,535
the money.

1041
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:44,636
Did you... did you make it?

1042
01:26:49,676 --> 01:26:51,346
How's your sister doing?

1043
01:26:55,451 --> 01:26:57,242
- She's good.
- Yeah?

1044
01:26:57,277 --> 01:26:59,783
Yeah, she's good.

1045
01:27:01,622 --> 01:27:03,116
You still painting?

1046
01:27:04,526 --> 01:27:05,855
A little bit.

1047
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:10,959
Good.
You should keep it up.

1048
01:27:10,994 --> 01:27:14,061
You're really talented.

1049
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:15,700
I never told you that,
but you are.

1050
01:27:18,672 --> 01:27:20,100
Thanks.

1051
01:27:40,826 --> 01:27:42,694
