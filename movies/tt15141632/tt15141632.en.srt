00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:28,445
I thought that was it.

00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:34,445
Major, I can go back and get a
metal detector

164
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,112
from the engineers.

165
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:39,679
And Frenchie is gonna say God
damn it four guys digging up

166
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:44,112
graves in their graveyard. Hell
no. They're gonna call

167
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:46,112
all their fucking buddies and be
back here digging up

168
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:50,112
every God damn grave before your
detector ever gets here.

I am worn God damn threadbare.
You hear me?

170
00:19:56,713 --> 00:20:00,713
I'm trying to see it in my head
like it was that night.

Look at this.

180

These Americans are so big, what
do they eat?

181
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:59,378
Well, they eat actual food.
That's a good start I guess.

182

doing? Why's he left his post?

193

trade out.

Not because of me. Because of
your greed.

You didn't kill Nazis for me or
my people.

You killed them because they
were shooting at you and

00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:07,313
wearing a different uniform.
You're no heroes.

family must be proud as punch.

473

The grave belongs to my family.
My mother and father

474
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:56,612
were tortured and murdered by an
SS officer called Von Bruckner.

475
00:53:56,646 --> 00:54:02,246
They were farmers. They would
never hurt anyone.

war.

Yep. You wanna try sliding it?

Well bless her pea picking

Ok. Let's pack this up and get

There ain't no Kraut in that

I put him in the grave myself.

The ambush was supposed to be
here at the cemetery,

It's not our fault, Marie.

The Maquis were afraid we'd been
compromised,

508
00:57:55,613 --> 00:57:58,546
so they moved the ambush
to highway 44.

509

We had to follow orders, Marie.

510
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,746
We were ordered to leave here
after the ambush went bad.

We should have been there for
you.

You're sorry?

being a collaborator. These
