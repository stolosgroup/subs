3
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,148
United States.

4
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,651
You're listening...

5
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,355
It was your first
game, you know.

6
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,123
You're not gonna win every game.

7
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:05,827
I just wanna go home.

8
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,463
We're gettin' there.

9
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,061
Dad!

10
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,228
She's bleeding!

11
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:44,699
Dad!

12
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,336
We'll stop in the next
town. I'll call the police.

13
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:05,853
Dad, that girl.

14
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,459
Tommy, listen to me carefully.

15
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,428
I'm gonna go outside,
I'm gonna lock this door,

16
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,632
and you don't open this door.

17
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,367
You don't open it for
anyone, no one but me.

18
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,003
Do you understand?

19
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:57,905
Mhm.

20
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,448
I'll be right back.

21
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:15,923
Hello?

22
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:23,765
Hello?

23
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,262
Open the door, please!

24
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,362
She's coming!

25
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,268
Lock it, lock it!

26
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,936
Please, she's coming!

27
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:02,703
Please!

28
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:04,505
Go, go, go!

29
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:05,438
She's gonna come!

30
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,008
Please!

31
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,709
I know it, I know it!

32
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:11,846
No!

33
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:13,848
No, get away!

34
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:42,610
Hey, Gerry.

35
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:48,716
It's okay.

36
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,219
It's over now.

37
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,924
Can you tell me your name?

38
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:08,569
Christina.

39
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,606
My name's Christina.

40
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:34,128
"Listen closely
and pay attention

41
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,100
to the what and the where.

42
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,675
Because when this is over,

43
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:53,281
you will wonder, how did
we get from here to there?"

44
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,190
Bye!

45
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,793
Bye.

46
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:06,894
Bye!

47
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:07,828
Bye, Miss Bowden.

48
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:08,663
Bye.

49
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,898
You did great today, Michael.

50
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:12,700
Thank you, Miss Bowden.

51
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:41,122
Give me it!

52
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,059
You're so annoying.

53
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,964
Christina Bowden?

54
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,199
Give me it!

55
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,107
Thank you.

56
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:03,778
Ha ha!

57
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,916
It's
perfect, really.

58
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,117
There's like a whole community,

59
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:12,119
and Lisa can have her own room.

60
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:14,688
There's a pool, and the
school system is great,

61
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,525
I've already inquired
about transferring.

62
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,558
Okay.

63
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,061
What about your boyfriend?

64
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:20,961
Tom, is it?

65
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,096
Is he going to go with you?

66
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,798
Yes, Tom.

67
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,599
He's excited about it.

68
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,902
There's a lot of
work down there,

69
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,571
and I think it's gonna be a
fresh start for all of us.

70
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,306
Well, this sounds
really great.

71
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,241
So, now we're just waiting
on the background check,

72
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,576
which should come
at any day now.

73
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,144
And if there are no surprises,

74
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:39,914
the only thing left is
the home inspection.

75
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,783
I have your address
here as 6 Emerald Drive.

76
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:43,717
Where's that?

77
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:44,952
Up on Northridge.

78
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,154
Oh, so you're
up in the snow?

79
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:48,155
Yeah.

80
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,090
I'll bring my boots.

81
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,962
So, one last question,
and this is just for me.

82
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,063
Of course.

83
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:57,798
This girl's no saint.

84
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:59,500
She's had trouble
with the police,

85
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:02,036
she's been in and out of
foster homes her entire life.

86
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,173
Why this girl?

87
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,314
I had a tough time
growing up, just like her.

88
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:18,553
And most of the things
that she's going through

89
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:20,855
are not her fault,

90
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,324
but she doesn't know that.

91
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,528
She thinks everything
is her fault.

92
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,064
She thinks she doesn't
deserve to be happy.

93
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:34,536
So she does bad
things, stupid things,

94
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:37,338
so that people see her the
way that she sees herself.

95
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,474
But I don't see her like that.

96
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:43,043
I see a scared kid who
deserves a second chance.

97
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,548
I think we all deserve
a second chance.

98
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,344
Hello?

99
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,379
Hello, is anyone there, hello?

100
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:53,414
Can anyone hear me?

101
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:55,749
Can anyone hear me?

102
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:56,685
We need help, now!

103
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:57,952
Oh, shit!

104
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,222
Ma'am, it's okay, I'm
trying to get you help.

105
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,290
It's okay, I'm gonna
get you help, it's okay.

106
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,459
What?

107
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,260
G-G...

108
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,061
Gun!

109
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:02,216
Hello?

110
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,553
Sheriff's department.

111
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,860
Mr. Cooper.

112
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:50,765
It's the sheriff's
department, it's time to go.

113
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,012
Mr. Cooper?

114
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,083
Sheriff's department.

115
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,085
You need to vacate, sir.

116
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:21,796
Mr. Cooper?

117
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:24,632
Sir?

118
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:32,640
This is Jamie.

119
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,577
Jamie,
it's Gerry Bailey.

120
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,114
What can I do for you, Gerry?

121
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,822
Do you know who
Elizabeth Caulfield is?

122
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:49,724
No.

123
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:51,626
Should I?

124
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,933
About 20 years ago, Caulfield
kidnapped 5 young girls.

125
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,103
3 from Massena, 2 from Wheaton.

126
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,406
In two of the cases,

127
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:08,275
the children were
taken from their homes,

128
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,077
parents murdered in their beds.

129
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:13,782
It went on for years.

130
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,652
Just dumb luck we caught her.

131
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,693
Where's
this going, Gerry?

132
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,999
There was an accident
this morning, up in Utica.

133
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,369
A U.S. Marshal was
transporting a prisoner.

134
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,873
Marshal's dead, the
prisoner's on the run.

135
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:41,543
Caulfield?

136
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:47,816
We found four girls in a
grave behind Caulfield's house.

137
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:52,186
The fifth one, the one that
survived, is still here,

138
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,320
living in Massena.

139
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,493
I think Caulfield may
come looking for her,

140
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:01,796
finish what she started.

141
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:06,200
I'd like you to make
sure that doesn't happen.

142
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,141
Jamie.

143
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,845
I'm gonna call
you back, Gerry.

144
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,716
Get out of my house.

145
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,652
Mr. Cooper, put the gun down.

146
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:28,088
This is my house,
my kids grew up here.

147
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:30,792
I got married here.

148
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:33,193
I understand, and
we can talk about it,

149
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:35,195
but you need to put
the gun down first.

150
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:37,899
Then what?

151
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:40,568
Then we'll walk out of
here like nothing happened.

152
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:42,035
But it did happen.

153
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,871
It all happened.

154
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:44,906
Now I'm nothing!

155
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:46,273
No, that's not true.

156
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,343
It's Kevin, right?

157
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,044
Can I call you Kevin?

158
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,515
You have your life,
this is just a house.

159
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,048
It doesn't make you who you are.

160
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:58,753
I'm
nothing now, nothing!

161
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,922
No, no, no, Kevin
don't do this,

162
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:02,222
we can talk about
it, don't do this...

163
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:55,944
Hello?

164
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:57,144
So, who is she?

165
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,603
Happy birthday, lady.

166
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:22,670
Thanks, sweetie.

167
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:24,906
Hey, where's Tom?

168
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,040
Oh, he had to work late.

169
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:28,509
Miss Bowden.

170
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:30,979
What's her name?

171
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:32,245
That's Rebecca.

172
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,347
Tracy, put her back on a shelf

173
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,949
before you break her, huh?

174
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:35,984
Oh, she's fine.

175
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,184
You want a piece of cake at all?

176
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,285
I'll bring it to you.

177
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,956
He's missing your birthday?

178
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,256
Oh, it's fine.

179
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,425
He's busy, and we're
gonna do something

180
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,393
later in the week.

181
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,999
Oh, hey, when's
this big announcement?

182
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:54,301
I guess Tom is gonna
miss that too, huh?

183
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,470
He knows already, so stop.

184
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:57,972
And I'll make the
big announcement

185
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:59,841
as soon as I find Lisa.

186
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:14,555
Occupied.

187
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:18,026
Still occupied.

188
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:19,994
Lisa, it's me.

189
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,265
You okay?

190
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:31,806
You missed the
whole happy birthday

191
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,709
and blowing out the
candles, et cetera.

192
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:37,210
I'm sorry, but here.

193
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,546
Happy birthday.

194
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,682
I told you not
to get me anything.

195
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:42,349
You have to wait 'til
you're alone to open it.

196
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,216
It's nothing, really.

197
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,022
Thank you.

198
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,057
You ready?

199
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,660
I guess.

200
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:53,828
What about you?

201
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,729
Are you ready?

202
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:57,264
Me?

203
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,901
I'm scared.

204
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,736
I've never been
anybody's mom before.

205
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:03,571
And I just keep thinking,

206
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,238
"What if I mess this up?

207
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,406
What if I do something wrong?

208
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,042
What if she hates me?"

209
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:11,579
Everyone messes
up sometimes, right?

210
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,447
Right.

211
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,982
So, why worry about it?

212
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:20,253
And even if you do,
I won't hate you.

213
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,556
That wouldn't be fair.

214
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:24,424
This is your first
time doing this,

215
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,492
so it's not gonna
be easy, right?

216
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:29,463
It's not gonna be easy,

217
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:31,799
but it's gonna be worth it.

218
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,467
I promise.

219
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,838
I'm ready.

220
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:39,372
Me too.

221
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,440
Come on.

222
00:20:42,577 --> 00:20:44,512
Can I have your
attention for a second?

223
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,216
Thank you for coming.

224
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,118
Today is not just
about my birthday.

225
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,286
I have something very special

226
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,489
that I want to
share with you all.

227
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:58,425
I have been keeping this
a secret for a while now,

228
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,595
but I am super
excited to say that...

229
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,599
We have another guest.

230
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:05,533
I'll be right back.

231
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,405
Hi.

232
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,274
I'm looking for
Christina Bowden.

233
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:16,343
That's me.

234
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:21,616
How can I help you?

235
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:24,351
I'm sorry to bother you
this late, Miss Bowden.

236
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:27,255
I'm Jamie Nwosu with the
sheriff's department.

237
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,156
Do you mind if I come in

238
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:29,322
and we can talk for a moment?

239
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:32,527
I'm sorry, I have company.

240
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,529
Can you just tell me
what this is about?

241
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,598
Did I do something wrong?

242
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:39,033
No, ma'am, it's not that.

243
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,469
About 8 hours ago,
there was an accident

244
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,939
up by Ulster County,
a car accident.

245
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,207
It was a prisoner transport.

246
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,708
The prisoner was to
get medical treatment

247
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:50,611
up in Ulster coming up
from Camden Township.

248
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:51,779
The car must've
hit a slick patch

249
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:53,446
and went off the road.

250
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,982
Unfortunately, the U.S. Marshal

251
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:57,118
who was driving
the car was killed.

252
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:59,020
That's awful, I'm sorry.

253
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,055
Yes, it is.

254
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,958
The reason I came to see you is

255
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,893
that the prisoner
who was in back

256
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,895
is currently unaccounted for.

257
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,630
That being said,

258
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,698
there are a lot of people
out there looking for her,

259
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:13,466
and we hope this is
wrapped up quickly.

260
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,669
But for the time being,

261
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,904
it might be good for you
to stay with a friend,

262
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:19,240
or get a hotel
room or something.

263
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:22,977
Why would I need to do that?

264
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,612
I just want to be careful.

265
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,248
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

266
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:33,120
Miss Bowden, the prisoner's
Elizabeth Caulfield.

267
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,392
What are you talking about?

268
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:42,730
I understand this
has to be a bit of a shock.

269
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,699
But I don't want you to panic.

270
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:48,035
Police are out there
looking for her.

271
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,038
Christina!

272
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,808
Christina!

273
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,615
Christina, where are you?

274
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:01,414
Christina?

275
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:03,918
Christina!

276
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,962
Shh, she'll hear you.

277
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:19,033
She's coming.

278
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:35,750
What's this one's name?

279
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:40,321
Hey, everything okay?

280
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:41,255
Who was at the door?

281
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,056
We have to go.

282
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,057
What?

283
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,158
- Why?
- Hey, are you okay?

284
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,593
You're white as a sheet.

285
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:46,961
I'm fine.

286
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:49,297
Something just came up, and
I need to take Lisa home.

287
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,731
Can you wrap this up here?

288
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:51,632
Just apologize to
everyone for me.

289
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,768
Christina, Christina, wait!

290
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:59,240
What's going on?

291
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,308
Why are the cops here?

292
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,015
There was some
break-ins in the neighborhood,

293
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:10,718
and it's just not safe for
you to be there right now.

294
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:14,355
Why are you lying to me?

295
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:15,790
Why can't you just tell
me what's going on?

296
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:17,258
It's complicated, Lisa.

297
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,693
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

298
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:21,796
Just tell me, I'm not
gonna be mad, I promise.

299
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,332
I just can't have
you near me right now.

300
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:26,000
Can't have me near you?

301
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:26,934
Why?

302
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:27,902
Just stop asking questions!

303
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:53,294
You don't have to
do this, you know.

304
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,161
I understand.

305
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:57,531
I'm used to it by now.

306
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,002
This is going to
happen, I promise.

307
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:02,570
Nothing has changed.

308
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:04,071
Something's changed.

309
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:05,373
You were just talking
about being family,

310
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:06,974
and now you're throwing
me out of your house.

311
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,476
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

312
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,745
I need time, I just need time.

313
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:21,789
I gotta go.

314
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:26,060
Lisa, wait!

315
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,153
Miss Bowden.

316
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:27,988
You all right, ma'am?

317
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:30,191
I'm okay.

318
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,127
So, what now?

319
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,428
I'm gonna stay
out here tonight,

320
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:35,729
keep an eye on things,

321
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:37,566
and hopefully by the
time you wake up,

322
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:38,499
this is all over.

323
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:41,602
Thank you, Officer.

324
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:43,337
Please, call me Jamie.

325
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:46,006
Thank you, Jamie.

326
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,841
Goodnight.

327
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,010
Miss Bowden.

328
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:53,180
I don't want you
to worry too much.

329
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:55,950
There are a ton
of law enforcement

330
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:57,618
out there looking for her.

331
00:26:57,651 --> 00:27:00,187
It's cold out, there are
road blocks everywhere,

332
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:02,256
she's gonna have a hard
enough time surviving,

333
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,191
much less have time
to think about you.

334
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:09,096
You don't understand, Jamie.

335
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,331
I'm all she thinks about.

336
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:33,354
Oh!

337
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:42,029
Hello?

338
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:45,567
Hey, there's somebody in here.

339
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:11,125
Hello?

340
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:16,658
She was a nurse.

341
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,930
Took care of the babies while
their moms got some sleep.

342
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:30,337
She seemed like a normal person.

343
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,578
But obviously there
was something different

344
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:38,613
going on in that woman's head.

345
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,755
One day she just
stopped coming to work,

346
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,022
dropped outta sight.

347
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:51,458
Five years later,
Christina disappeared.

348
00:29:53,662 --> 00:29:56,397
After that, every year,
another girl would go missing,

349
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,201
and every year the girl she took

350
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:03,470
would be a year older
than the girl before.

351
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:06,708
Strange, isn't it?

352
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:09,877
Christina being the first.

353
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,078
Yeah, just random.

354
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,785
I mean, she's the
first to be taken,

355
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:18,586
she lives with
Caulfield the longest,

356
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,690
and yet she's the
one that gets away.

357
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:22,837
Good morning, Miss Bowden.

358
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:24,037
Is it a good morning?

359
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:25,840
No.

360
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:28,910
They're still looking for her.

361
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,210
I see.

362
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:31,144
Is there somewhere
I can take you?

363
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:33,180
A friend that you can stay with?

364
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:34,816
No.

365
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,718
I mean, I've decided
I'm staying here.

366
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,522
Miss Bowden, we're
a small department.

367
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:42,690
I don't have the
kind of resources

368
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:45,392
to keep an eye on you 24/7.

369
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:48,195
Please stop calling
me Miss Bowden.

370
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:49,931
That's what my students call me.

371
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:51,031
It's Christina.

372
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:55,035
And it's not just
about staying home.

373
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:57,939
I have a life here, a job.

374
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:59,206
I can't just run away.

375
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:01,943
I'm not asking you to run,

376
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:04,913
just hide for a little while,

377
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:06,046
until this is over.

378
00:34:07,882 --> 00:34:10,284
Look, Jamie, I appreciate
what you're doing.

379
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:11,118
I really do.

380
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,087
And I don't expect
you to understand.

381
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:17,157
But she took everything
away from me once.

382
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:20,294
Everything I ever
loved, she destroyed.

383
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,164
I'm not gonna let
her do that again.

384
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:37,311
Hi.

385
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:39,948
Hey.

386
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,086
Shoot the ball,
shoot the ball.

387
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:48,890
Over here!

388
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,123
Pass it to me!

389
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:05,305
I know that he loves me
whether I'm right.

390
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:09,276
Or whether I'm wrong, for
the Bible tells me so.

391
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:11,879
Is that enough?

392
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:33,400
You have a visitor.

393
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:44,879
Hey, Gerry.

394
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:45,713
Jamie.

395
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,017
I wasn't expecting you.

396
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:57,992
Is there a problem, Gerry?

397
00:35:58,026 --> 00:35:59,159
No.

398
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:00,227
Come on in.

399
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:13,875
Amy?

400
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,176
Jamie!

401
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,346
What are you doing here?

402
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:21,314
I thought you
were at the doctors.

403
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,349
I was.

404
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:25,352
I didn't know you were...

405
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:28,388
Back in town.

406
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:29,657
I am.

407
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:31,191
I moved back in a
couple of months ago.

408
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,762
Doctors want me to be
near family, just in case.

409
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:37,464
Congratulations.

410
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,600
Thank you.

411
00:36:41,536 --> 00:36:43,738
How far along are you?

412
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,575
Um, all the way?

413
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:50,210
Amy?

414
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:52,345
Shouldn't you be lying down?

415
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,480
Hello, Mrs. Bailey.

416
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:56,450
She's right.

417
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:57,885
I'm supposed to
stay off my feet.

418
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:01,288
It was nice seeing you, Jamie.

419
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,489
Nice to see you too.

420
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,134
Close the door behind you.

421
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:25,880
Can't make it down the hall

422
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,347
without needing to
suck on this thing.

423
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:32,419
That's Arlene's father.

424
00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:36,490
He was deep in
politics around here.

425
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,728
You should've seen the
cold shoulder she got

426
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:42,997
for bringing home some
dumb security guard.

427
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:45,465
You could've told me.

428
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:49,971
Not something we're
broadcasting all over town.

429
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:54,441
She ain't married, father wants
nothing to do with the baby,

430
00:37:54,474 --> 00:37:55,710
Arlene's sick about it.

431
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:59,814
We're just trying to keep
it quiet for right now.

432
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:09,289
But we're not here to
talk about Amy, are we?

433
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:11,225
No.

434
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:13,795
No, we're not.

435
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,500
So, how is she?

436
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:22,837
A little shook up.

437
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,006
But if she's scared, she
hides it pretty well.

438
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,641
She's tough.

439
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:29,944
Had to be to survive
that crazy bitch.

440
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:30,978
Seems that way.

441
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:34,481
She decided to
stay in the house.

442
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,652
She's staying?

443
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:38,418
Yeah.

444
00:38:39,419 --> 00:38:40,688
Why would she do that?

445
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:43,191
I don't know her.

446
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:46,194
I mean, she's a grown woman now,

447
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:48,461
and Caulfield is what,
60 something years old?

448
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,065
You're gonna keep an
eye on her for me, Jamie.

449
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:53,534
I don't want anything
happening to her.

450
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:56,504
Gerry, you know better
than anyone our resources.

451
00:38:56,537 --> 00:38:58,840
I can't have
someone on her 24/7.

452
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:00,908
That's a job for FBI or state.

453
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:02,310
No.

454
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,912
They get involved, it'll
be all over the news.

455
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:06,346
Why is that a bad thing?

456
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:10,685
I don't think you
understand what happened here.

457
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:17,024
That little girl and the others
were taken under my nose,

458
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:18,726
murdered on my watch.

459
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:23,030
For a long time, I couldn't
show my face in this town.

460
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:27,268
The minute anyone
knows who she is,

461
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:29,737
it'll be like those
murders happened yesterday.

462
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:32,607
You think I want
to put this town,

463
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,642
my daughter, my wife
through that again?

464
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:37,812
And Christina.

465
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,314
Right?

466
00:39:41,649 --> 00:39:42,449
Right.

467
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:45,253
And Christina.

468
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:08,843
Shh.

469
00:40:21,923 --> 00:40:23,257
She's coming!

470
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:25,326
Shh.

471
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:25,820
Hello?

472
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:26,787
Casey.

473
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:28,990
Hey, it's Jamie Nwosu.

474
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:30,658
Hey, Jamie.

475
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,460
Let me guess...

476
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,362
No, I didn't break
my phone again.

477
00:41:35,763 --> 00:41:37,098
This is something different.

478
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:50,544
Don't you have a
crime lab or something for this?

479
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:52,346
No, I have to send it off,

480
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,548
and I'm kind of in a rush, so.

481
00:41:58,085 --> 00:42:00,054
You smell like cigarettes.

482
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:01,889
I was with someone
who smokes a lot.

483
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,692
Smoke don't care
who lights it,

484
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:06,060
makes you smell just the same.

485
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:15,603
Tell him
how old you are today.

486
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:16,937
I'm 10 years old today.

487
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:23,811
What is this?

488
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:27,114
Jesus loves me, this I know,

489
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:32,386
because the Bible tells me so.

490
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:35,656
What's happening?

491
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:38,292
The tape is old.

492
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:41,062
It's a miracle it
still plays at all.

493
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:42,563
What's that right there?

494
00:42:42,596 --> 00:42:43,597
Over that picture?

495
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:44,965
It's a timestamp.

496
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,001
Some old video cameras
used to burn that in.

497
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:50,938
Can you clean it up
somehow so I can read that?

498
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:52,940
I can try.

499
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:55,976
Where did you get this?

500
00:42:57,578 --> 00:43:00,815
Elizabeth Caulfield's
home, 25 years ago.

501
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,050
The woman on the news?

502
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:03,818
Yeah.

503
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:07,354
So this is one of the
girls that she killed.

504
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:11,092
No.

505
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,760
This is the one that got away.

506
00:43:14,028 --> 00:43:14,995
The
search continues

507
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:16,664
over a wide area
of the northeast

508
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:19,600
as local law enforcement
from surrounding counties

509
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:20,901
join in the effort.

510
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:22,504
The search area
has been expanded

511
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:24,905
to cover up to 200 square miles

512
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:26,407
from the original crash site.

513
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,275
But so far, there's
been no sighting

514
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:29,578
of any kind...

515
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,011
Of Ms. Caulfield.

516
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:33,814
She's considered to be
armed and dangerous.

517
00:43:33,848 --> 00:43:35,517
Originally a nurse
in the maternity ward

518
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,951
in Massena County Hospital,

519
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:40,287
Ms. Caulfield went on
to kidnap 5 young girls.

520
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,126
Hey!

521
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:46,127
Hi, Miss Bowden.

522
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:48,496
What are you doing here?

523
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,030
What do you mean?

524
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:52,199
You said you could watch
Tracy while I went to my class.

525
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:53,167
Did you forget?

526
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:55,236
No.

527
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:57,671
Okay, maybe I did forget.

528
00:43:57,705 --> 00:43:58,939
Oh, Chris.

529
00:43:58,973 --> 00:44:00,474
I promise, I'll be
back in two hours tops.

530
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:01,208
Okay?

531
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:02,476
Sure.

532
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:03,277
Have fun.

533
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,345
Thank you.

534
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,451
The house,

535
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:11,652
and she has remained
out of the public eye

536
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:13,687
despite Caulfield's escape.

537
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,793
So, what do you
want to do today?

538
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:21,896
Do you want to draw?

539
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:22,830
Or read a story?

540
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:25,199
Let's play a game.

541
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:32,206
One...

542
00:44:33,274 --> 00:44:34,074
Two...

543
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:36,043
Three...

544
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:38,379
Four...

545
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:40,615
Five...

546
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:42,750
Six...

547
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,486
Seven...

548
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,254
Eight...

549
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:48,355
Nine...

550
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:51,759
Ten!

551
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:52,594
Tracy...

552
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:55,362
Where are you?

553
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:03,070
I'm gonna find you!

554
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:10,778
Hello?

555
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:12,046
Oh, hi, Christina.

556
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,248
This is Elaine
Foster, Tom's mom.

557
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:15,550
Hi, how are you?

558
00:45:15,584 --> 00:45:18,419
I'm okay, I'm
just a little worried.

559
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:21,188
And look, I know you and Tom
are not together anymore,

560
00:45:21,222 --> 00:45:23,357
but have you heard from him?

561
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,893
No, we haven't
spoken in a while.

562
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:27,194
Oh.

563
00:45:27,228 --> 00:45:28,295
He just didn't show
up for work today,

564
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:30,565
and I've been trying
to call him all day

565
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,266
and he's not picking up.

566
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:34,134
I'm starting to get
a little worried.

567
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:36,671
Listen, my husband
thinks I'm crazy.

568
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:39,273
Tracy, you can come out now!

569
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:40,709
This is
kinda not like him.

570
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:43,277
He always calls me, and I
feel like something is wrong.

571
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,647
Tracy,
the game is over.

572
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,881
I'm sorry, I
didn't know who else to call,

573
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,316
and I'm just worried about him.

574
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:53,287
I was wondering if you
could just stop by the house

575
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,256
and see if everything is okay?

576
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:56,156
Of course.

577
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,626
I can stop before work tomorrow.

578
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:58,926
Tracy!

579
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,894
Oh, thanks
so much, Christina.

580
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:01,730
Yeah, no problem.

581
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:02,496
Take care.

582
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,330
Tracy?

583
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:06,100
Tracy?

584
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:08,435
The game is over!

585
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:10,605
Tracy!

586
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:13,140
Tracy!

587
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,512
I can't find her!

588
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:19,446
I think she cheated.

589
00:46:21,716 --> 00:46:23,317
What?

590
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,519
I saw her on the
porch when I pulled up,

591
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:26,287
said she was playing
hide and seek.

592
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:29,023
I'm sorry.

593
00:46:29,056 --> 00:46:30,124
Get inside, please.

594
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:34,328
I'm babysitting.

595
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:36,130
Like that's what
I need right now.

596
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:36,964
You okay?

597
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:39,668
No.

598
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:40,702
She scared the hell out of me.

599
00:46:40,735 --> 00:46:41,969
I can see that.

600
00:46:43,638 --> 00:46:46,373
Do you want to come in?

601
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:47,975
I need a glass of wine or two.

602
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:16,671
Can I offer you a glass?

603
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:17,505
Water's fine.

604
00:47:20,074 --> 00:47:22,242
Oh, I'm sorry.

605
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:24,746
I'm a wreck, you must
think I'm a crazy person.

606
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:26,847
No, not at all.

607
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,317
That woman being out
there, all this going on,

608
00:47:30,351 --> 00:47:32,587
I don't think I'd be able to
handle it as well as you are.

609
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,723
Is that what I'm doing?

610
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,526
You seem composed.

611
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,728
On the outside, at least.

612
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,263
Where are you from, Jamie?

613
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:46,367
That accent is definitely
not upstate New York.

614
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,368
No, it's not.

615
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,538
I grew up in the city,

616
00:47:51,706 --> 00:47:53,974
but my parents are
both from Nigeria, so,

617
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:58,445
I had that around the house,

618
00:47:58,479 --> 00:48:00,715
and I guess it's
there somewhere.

619
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:03,217
My friends used
to make fun of me,

620
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,588
said when I had a few
drinks I'd go full Nigerian.

621
00:48:06,621 --> 00:48:07,589
Full Nigerian?

622
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:09,490
Yeah, it's...

623
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:11,659
I'd be like...

624
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:16,598
Miss Bowden, I'm very,
very worried about you,

625
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:18,298
but I don't want
you to be concerned.

626
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:21,603
I am here to make sure
that you are very safe.

627
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:23,470
That's pretty good.

628
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:24,304
Thank you.

629
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,642
So, what brought
you to Massena?

630
00:48:29,844 --> 00:48:31,679
I followed a girl
out of school, NYU.

631
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:36,350
I got a job that I liked
doing, so I stayed.

632
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:39,754
What happened to the girl?

633
00:48:39,788 --> 00:48:41,823
It was good for a while.

634
00:48:41,856 --> 00:48:44,793
But in the end,
her family had a...

635
00:48:44,826 --> 00:48:45,660
How can I put it,

636
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:49,296
higher aspirations
for their daughter.

637
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:52,667
So you let her go?

638
00:48:53,802 --> 00:48:54,935
Not really.

639
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,438
I made a choice.

640
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:02,209
What about you?

641
00:49:03,143 --> 00:49:04,044
Why are you here?

642
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,949
I was born here, I didn't
really have a choice.

643
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:10,919
But you do now.

644
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:13,320
With everything that
happened, why stay?

645
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:18,325
I'm sorry.

646
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:23,130
It's none of my business.

647
00:49:23,163 --> 00:49:24,465
I'm gonna go back outside.

648
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:25,299
No, please.

649
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,067
Sit.

650
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:30,538
I've gotten so used to
keeping it to myself

651
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,874
that I've forgotten what
it's like to talk about it.

652
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:38,813
I didn't know where I lived,

653
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:41,014
I didn't know what Massena was.

654
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:43,651
I didn't know anything
but that shack of a house.

655
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:47,689
My parents were gone, no family,

656
00:49:47,722 --> 00:49:51,225
so the state put me in a
foster home until I was 17.

657
00:49:52,927 --> 00:49:55,329
No one wants the girl
with the fucked up past.

658
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:59,099
And I left for a while,
I went to school.

659
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:02,402
But I kept coming back.

660
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:05,940
And at first I thought it
was because I felt guilty

661
00:50:07,407 --> 00:50:09,009
leaving the others behind.

662
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,779
The other girls in that house.

663
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:16,518
They didn't get to
leave, so why should I?

664
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,888
But then I realized something,

665
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:22,089
something that I
couldn't explain

666
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:25,058
until I started
teaching, then I did.

667
00:50:26,861 --> 00:50:30,532
I wanted to try to
fix what she did here.

668
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:32,332
The hurt she caused.

669
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:33,868
Try to be the opposite.

670
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:37,371
And that's what I'm
trying to do with Lisa.

671
00:50:37,404 --> 00:50:39,106
That young girl at the party?

672
00:50:39,941 --> 00:50:41,009
Yes.

673
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,944
She's a foster child like I was,

674
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:44,579
she's alone like I was.

675
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:47,080
So maybe that's why I'm here,

676
00:50:47,982 --> 00:50:49,449
or maybe it's all those things.

677
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,922
Or maybe I'm afraid if I leave

678
00:50:53,955 --> 00:50:55,055
I'll forget who I am.

679
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:07,802
Hey, what's going on?

680
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:09,169
Why are the police here again?

681
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:12,941
There were a couple of
break-ins down the road,

682
00:51:12,974 --> 00:51:15,075
and they just want to keep
an eye on the neighborhood.

683
00:51:15,108 --> 00:51:17,812
They asked if they could
stay out a few nights, so.

684
00:51:19,112 --> 00:51:21,816
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to tell me, Chris?

685
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:23,818
You seem a little off.

686
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:25,987
I'm fine, everything's fine.

687
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,287
I just need some sleep.

688
00:51:30,157 --> 00:51:30,925
Bye.

689
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:08,128
So, you've seen it?

690
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:10,464
Yeah, a long time ago.

691
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:12,600
But from what I remember,

692
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:14,969
it was little Christina
singing some Bible song.

693
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:17,270
Right.

694
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,506
In the beginning of the tape,

695
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:20,541
you can hear Caulfield say,

696
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:22,209
"Tell him how old you are."

697
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:25,145
Who's the him?

698
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:29,149
I don't know.

699
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:31,218
But from what I remember,

700
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:33,054
Caulfield was kind of a fanatic,

701
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:34,388
probably talking about Jesus.

702
00:52:37,058 --> 00:52:39,159
And why are you looking at
that stuff anyway, Jamie?

703
00:52:40,227 --> 00:52:42,195
We know what happened
in that house.

704
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:44,866
I'm keeping an
eye on her, Gerry,

705
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:46,366
just like you asked me to.

706
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,535
Get up.

707
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:36,403
Tomorrow.

708
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:37,672
No, we'll get caught.

709
00:55:37,705 --> 00:55:39,240
Tomorrow we run.

710
00:55:39,273 --> 00:55:41,642
Get up!

711
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:01,989
Good morning.

712
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:05,492
I have cream inside,
sugar if you like.

713
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:06,327
This is fine.

714
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:08,162
How'd you sleep?

715
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,331
Good.

716
00:57:10,364 --> 00:57:11,165
How about you?

717
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,269
That would kind of defeat
the purpose of being out here.

718
00:57:15,303 --> 00:57:16,304
Right.

719
00:57:16,337 --> 00:57:17,838
Of course.

720
00:57:17,872 --> 00:57:19,907
What happened to your hand?

721
00:57:19,941 --> 00:57:22,743
Oh, I just got it
caught in the door.

722
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:23,644
It's fine, really.

723
00:57:24,879 --> 00:57:28,416
So, any news?

724
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:29,650
Yes, actually.

725
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:31,819
Police found the
tow truck she stole,

726
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:32,987
it was off the side of the road

727
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,890
about 40 miles southwest
of the accident.

728
00:57:36,824 --> 00:57:37,625
South.

729
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:39,760
Away from here.

730
00:57:39,794 --> 00:57:41,295
That's good, right?

731
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:42,964
Better than the
other direction.

732
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:47,768
Well, I better get to work.

733
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:50,771
Well, you have my
number if you need me.

734
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:52,807
If not, I'll just see
you back here tonight.

735
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:57,111
It's funny.

736
00:57:57,144 --> 00:57:59,180
This is the most stable
relationship I've been in.

737
00:57:59,213 --> 00:58:01,282
It's only been two days.

738
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:02,149
Like I said.

739
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,074
Tom?

740
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:07,081
Tom, are you here?

741
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:26,634
Hello?

742
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:28,069
Hi, Mrs. Foster.

743
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:29,303
Hey, it's Christina.

744
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:30,638
Oh, hi.

745
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:33,240
Yeah, I'm here,
and he's not here.

746
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:34,875
But his truck is
gone, I think...

747
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:36,310
Maybe he went skiing
with his friends

748
00:59:36,343 --> 00:59:37,945
and he forgot to tell you?

749
00:59:37,978 --> 00:59:40,448
That would
be very unlike him.

750
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:41,715
But maybe you're right,

751
00:59:41,749 --> 00:59:44,452
maybe he's just
doing something fun.

752
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:47,788
Christina?

753
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:51,659
Christina, are you there?

754
00:59:52,827 --> 00:59:54,261
Christina!

755
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:57,398
Christina, answer me.

756
00:59:57,431 --> 00:59:59,534
She'll hear you!

757
01:00:01,502 --> 01:00:03,137
She's coming!

758
01:00:27,661 --> 01:00:29,964
Back bedroom to the left.

759
01:00:37,404 --> 01:00:39,140
His mother won't
stop calling me.

760
01:00:42,843 --> 01:00:44,044
He didn't deserve that.

761
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:48,649
He was a liar, and a cheat,
but he didn't deserve that.

762
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:53,354
When was the last
time you saw him?

763
01:00:57,158 --> 01:00:58,159
I don't know.

764
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:01,362
A week ago I came
by for some stuff.

765
01:01:04,064 --> 01:01:05,332
Why'd you two break up?

766
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:08,969
Because he was
screwing half the town.

767
01:01:09,003 --> 01:01:10,204
But what does it matter?

768
01:01:11,405 --> 01:01:12,206
She did this.

769
01:01:14,275 --> 01:01:16,076
Caulfield?

770
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,278
You think she did this?

771
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:22,283
You don't?

772
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:28,222
I'm sorry, but how would
she even know who he is?

773
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:33,093
I don't know.

774
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:36,697
I understand you're upset,

775
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:40,067
and the knee-jerk reaction
is to think that it's her,

776
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,538
but we don't know what
happened in there.

777
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:47,074
You said he was sleeping
with several people,

778
01:01:47,107 --> 01:01:51,178
this could be someone's
husband, a jealous lover,

779
01:01:51,212 --> 01:01:53,414
any one of them would
have a reason to do this.

780
01:01:54,448 --> 01:01:56,083
Did you see that in there?

781
01:01:57,384 --> 01:02:00,287
Did that look like an
angry soccer mom did that,

782
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:02,056
or a jealous husband?

783
01:02:02,923 --> 01:02:05,694
I don't know who did this,

784
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:08,963
but Tom Foster never did
anything to Elizabeth Caulfield,

785
01:02:08,996 --> 01:02:11,098
why would she come after him?

786
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:12,466
Neither did my sisters,

787
01:02:12,499 --> 01:02:14,835
but that didn't stop her
from killing them, did it?

788
01:02:17,505 --> 01:02:19,240
No.

789
01:02:19,273 --> 01:02:20,074
It didn't.

790
01:02:23,143 --> 01:02:23,911
Can I go?

791
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:26,146
Sure.

792
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:46,400
You know who she is, right?

793
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:47,669
Of course you do.

794
01:02:47,702 --> 01:02:49,770
That's why you got those
bags under your eyes.

795
01:02:51,305 --> 01:02:53,140
Gerry Bailey, still
got you by the balls

796
01:02:53,173 --> 01:02:54,609
after all these years.

797
01:02:55,543 --> 01:02:56,611
You know her?

798
01:02:58,613 --> 01:03:00,447
I was there the
night we found her.

799
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:03,117
I'll never forget her face,
20 years later or not.

800
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:07,988
She thinks this was Caulfield.

801
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:11,859
The woman who
killed her parents

802
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:12,993
just broke out of prison,

803
01:03:13,027 --> 01:03:15,129
and now her boyfriend's dead?

804
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:16,030
Can you blame her?

805
01:03:18,499 --> 01:03:20,267
Nope.

806
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:23,505
But if she's right, then
someone is helping Caulfield.

807
01:03:23,538 --> 01:03:25,806
Who would help her?

808
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:26,641
I don't know.

809
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:31,378
But I'm gonna find out.

810
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:55,369
Hey, no pushing!

811
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:56,738
Slow down, Mr. Donovan.

812
01:03:56,771 --> 01:03:58,673
Matt, have you seen Lisa?

813
01:03:58,707 --> 01:04:00,207
No, I don't think
she was in today.

814
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,208
Is everything okay?

815
01:04:02,744 --> 01:04:04,512
Christina, are you okay?

816
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,614
Where is she?

817
01:04:08,683 --> 01:04:10,017
Look.

818
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,553
She said she didn't feel
like going to school today.

819
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:14,054
She's been all upset and stuff.

820
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:15,356
Any idea why?

821
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:16,758
I don't have time for this.

822
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,693
I just need you tell
me where she is.

823
01:04:18,727 --> 01:04:21,161
I don't need to do anything.

824
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,096
Where is she?

825
01:04:23,097 --> 01:04:23,931
Church.

826
01:04:24,932 --> 01:04:26,568
She said she was
going to church.

827
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:43,117
Lisa?

828
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:45,219
What are
you doing here?

829
01:04:45,252 --> 01:04:46,420
I'm looking for you!

830
01:04:47,955 --> 01:04:49,890
Well, mission
accomplished, you can go home now.

831
01:04:49,923 --> 01:04:51,593
Whose car is that?

832
01:04:51,626 --> 01:04:52,727
Leave me alone, okay?

833
01:04:52,761 --> 01:04:54,696
Lisa, I know you're upset,

834
01:04:54,729 --> 01:04:56,798
but you can't be here right now.

835
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,198
I shouldn't told you
what was going on,

836
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:00,901
and I will, but you
need to come with me.

837
01:05:00,934 --> 01:05:01,736
No, thanks.

838
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:04,071
Lisa, this is important.

839
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,842
She said no thanks.

840
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:15,583
I don't even want to know
what the two of you were doing,

841
01:05:15,617 --> 01:05:17,585
I just want you out
of here right now.

842
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:19,721
Leave me alone, okay?

843
01:05:19,754 --> 01:05:20,755
I'll get her home.

844
01:05:22,757 --> 01:05:24,626
How old are you?

845
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:25,827
Old enough.

846
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,127
Old enough to go to jail?

847
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,163
You know she's a minor?

848
01:05:29,196 --> 01:05:30,164
What?

849
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:31,833
Minor, like 13
years old minor.

850
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,802
Like if you touch
her, it's rape.

851
01:05:33,835 --> 01:05:34,736
What are you doing?

852
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:36,003
I didn't do anything with her.

853
01:05:36,036 --> 01:05:37,639
Good.

854
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:38,673
You can tell that to the
police once they get here.

855
01:05:38,706 --> 01:05:39,841
What's wrong with you?

856
01:05:39,874 --> 01:05:41,609
Get your stuff and let's go.

857
01:05:42,877 --> 01:05:44,178
I'm not going anywhere.

858
01:05:48,148 --> 01:05:48,949
Now!

859
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:57,357
Are you crazy being up
there alone with that boy,

860
01:05:57,391 --> 01:05:58,927
skipping class?

861
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:00,127
You want to ruin everything?

862
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,328
Me?

863
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:02,664
I'm not the one
fucking ruining shit!

864
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:03,865
Watch your mouth!

865
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:05,199
It's bad enough you
look like a hooker,

866
01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:06,935
you don't have to
sound like one too.

867
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,202
I look like a fool,
that's what I look like

868
01:06:08,235 --> 01:06:10,337
because I believed you!

869
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,172
You look like a fool?

870
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:14,843
I'm trying to show the state
that I can take care of you,

871
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:16,845
give you a real home.

872
01:06:16,878 --> 01:06:18,011
And you want to throw that away

873
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:19,647
just so you can suck
face with some loser

874
01:06:19,681 --> 01:06:20,815
in the middle of the afternoon?

875
01:06:20,849 --> 01:06:22,282
We were just hanging out,

876
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:24,786
and I don't have to listen
to you or the fucking state!

877
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:25,820
Stop cursing!

878
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:27,120
Fuck you!

879
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:28,623
You're not my mother,
so stop acting like it.

880
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:29,891
You don't care about me.

881
01:06:29,924 --> 01:06:31,325
You just want to feel
good about yourself,

882
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:33,795
patch up whatever little
fucked up hole you have inside.

883
01:06:33,828 --> 01:06:36,196
This is just some sick
do-over for you, isn't it?

884
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,832
Well, you know what?

885
01:06:37,866 --> 01:06:38,867
I don't need your pity, I
can take care of myself.

886
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,367
I've been doing
it my whole life.

887
01:06:45,573 --> 01:06:46,674
Lisa.

888
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:48,175
I'm sorry I yelled,

889
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,177
just please get back in the car
and I'll explain everything.

890
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,078
Explain this.

891
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:53,280
Lisa!

892
01:07:06,528 --> 01:07:07,996
Miss Conley?

893
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:09,864
Oh, Christ.

894
01:07:09,898 --> 01:07:11,599
I thought I was
done with you boys.

895
01:07:14,903 --> 01:07:18,673
I have made more copies
of the same documents...

896
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:20,073
Don't you all share stuff?

897
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:22,710
Not as much
as you'd imagine.

898
01:07:26,548 --> 01:07:28,750
Not much in here.

899
01:07:28,783 --> 01:07:31,719
Initial employment, peer review,

900
01:07:31,753 --> 01:07:33,387
that type of thing.

901
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:37,959
Are you looking for
something specific?

902
01:07:39,226 --> 01:07:41,663
How long have you worked
at the hospital, Miss Conley?

903
01:07:42,964 --> 01:07:44,632
If you're asking
if I was employed

904
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:47,001
when she worked here, I was.

905
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:50,437
I didn't know her well.

906
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,239
Seemed like a normal person.

907
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:56,811
Took care of those
little babies just fine.

908
01:07:56,844 --> 01:07:58,546
Oh, there's even letters
in there from parents

909
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,883
who said she was the best
night mother on the ward.

910
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:03,585
Did her job, no problems,

911
01:08:03,618 --> 01:08:05,118
right up 'til she was fired.

912
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:10,090
Says reason for termination
was erratic behavior.

913
01:08:10,123 --> 01:08:12,660
I know what it
says, I wrote it.

914
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:14,194
What kind of erratic behavior?

915
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,364
I don't remember, it
was a long time ago.

916
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:21,703
You remembered she
was good at her job.

917
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:25,272
You remember these
letters in the file,

918
01:08:25,305 --> 01:08:28,275
but you don't remember
why she was fired?

919
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:32,080
I just did what
I was asked to do.

920
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:34,181
They said it was to
protect the hospital.

921
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:39,453
Jean, I've got two people
lying in a pool of blood

922
01:08:39,486 --> 01:08:40,755
not two miles from here.

923
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:42,189
There is a chance that Caulfield

924
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:43,290
had something to do with it,

925
01:08:43,323 --> 01:08:46,094
and if she did, she had help.

926
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:47,829
Possibly from
someone in her past.

927
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:50,230
So please, anything you know.

928
01:08:53,801 --> 01:08:56,938
There was a rumor that
she was having an affair

929
01:08:56,971 --> 01:08:58,773
with a man who worked
here at the hospital.

930
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:00,307
A married man.

931
01:09:01,174 --> 01:09:02,844
So, they let her go.

932
01:09:07,682 --> 01:09:11,686
This man, do
you have his name?

933
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:13,387
Or do you know where
I can find him?

934
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:18,225
Up until 5 years ago, he
was wearing your uniform.

935
01:09:34,108 --> 01:09:34,909
Hey.

936
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:39,246
Well, look who it is.

937
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,081
Hey yourself.

938
01:09:46,386 --> 01:09:49,924
I'm guessing you didn't
come by to see me and mom.

939
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:52,860
No.

940
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:55,730
We got in an argument.

941
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:57,364
Oh.

942
01:09:57,397 --> 01:09:58,933
And I'm worried she's
gonna do something stupid.

943
01:09:58,966 --> 01:10:00,802
Yeah, well, she's not here.

944
01:10:01,636 --> 01:10:02,904
But she'll turn up.

945
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:04,072
I mean, probably in
the back of a cop car,

946
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:05,973
but she always comes back.

947
01:10:08,109 --> 01:10:09,242
She's a good kid.

948
01:10:10,243 --> 01:10:11,278
Yeah, well, you know,

949
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:12,547
if she doesn't straighten out,

950
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:14,281
she's gonna end up
just like her mother.

951
01:10:15,616 --> 01:10:17,217
Is that what you're doing?

952
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,251
Straightening her out,

953
01:10:18,285 --> 01:10:20,088
keeping in her room
for hours on end?

954
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:20,922
Oh, look.

955
01:10:22,123 --> 01:10:24,859
You break the rules, you
get the consequences.

956
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:26,127
That's how it is in my house,

957
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,328
that's how it is in the
world, you know that.

958
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:30,430
But hey, you know what?

959
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:31,465
School's gonna be over soon.

960
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:32,900
And she'll be my
problem, not yours,

961
01:10:32,934 --> 01:10:34,468
you don't have to
worry about it.

962
01:10:36,904 --> 01:10:39,073
She's not gonna be
your problem for long.

963
01:10:44,612 --> 01:10:45,613
Oh my God.

964
01:10:47,314 --> 01:10:49,150
It's you, ain't it?

965
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,088
The social worker told me
there was somebody interested.

966
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,324
That's what this
is about, right?

967
01:10:57,357 --> 01:10:59,326
I mean, you're
trying to adopt her.

968
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:01,129
Yeah, she deserves
a real family.

969
01:11:01,162 --> 01:11:02,496
She has a real family!

970
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:08,169
God, I mean nobody else
wanted that girl, no one!

971
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:11,438
We took her in, we
gave her a home,

972
01:11:11,471 --> 01:11:13,941
we gave her a family,
just like you!

973
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:16,811
She's a paycheck to
you, and you know it,

974
01:11:16,844 --> 01:11:18,079
just like I was!

975
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:19,680
We gave you everything we had!

976
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:22,382
Yeah.

977
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:24,619
I know.

978
01:11:24,652 --> 01:11:26,821
I remember everything
you gave me.

979
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:33,161
I...

980
01:11:34,562 --> 01:11:37,165
I have not had a
drink in 10 years,

981
01:11:38,365 --> 01:11:41,202
and I have never laid
a hand on that girl.

982
01:11:41,235 --> 01:11:42,637
Yeah, and you never will.

983
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,641
Please.

984
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:51,045
We got nothing else
coming in, right?

985
01:11:51,913 --> 01:11:54,081
I mean, she's all we got.

986
01:11:56,517 --> 01:11:57,251
Yeah.

987
01:11:59,153 --> 01:12:01,656
Well, that makes two of us.

988
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:02,690
Does she know?

989
01:12:04,592 --> 01:12:05,358
About you?

990
01:12:09,564 --> 01:12:12,300
What do you think she
says when she finds out,

991
01:12:12,332 --> 01:12:14,101
when she finds out
the truth about you?

992
01:12:15,536 --> 01:12:16,938
I mean, we all got our secrets.

993
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:22,577
What do you think she says
when she finds out yours?

994
01:12:42,063 --> 01:12:43,231
Hello?

995
01:12:43,264 --> 01:12:44,397
Hello, Mrs. Bailey?

996
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:45,700
This is Jamie Nwosu.

997
01:12:45,733 --> 01:12:47,134
Can I speak with Gerry, please?

998
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,138
My husband is resting.

999
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:53,473
This is important.

1000
01:12:54,308 --> 01:12:56,277
My husband is not well,

1001
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:59,881
and I would appreciate it if
you don't call here anymore.

1002
01:12:59,914 --> 01:13:00,715
Goodnight.

1003
01:13:56,837 --> 01:13:58,005
Where are you?

1004
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,409
I'm here.

1005
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:02,310
Are you okay?

1006
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:03,344
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1007
01:14:03,377 --> 01:14:04,712
I'm fine, it's okay.

1008
01:14:05,713 --> 01:14:08,649
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said what I said.

1009
01:14:08,683 --> 01:14:10,952
It's fine,
I'm just happy you're safe.

1010
01:14:10,985 --> 01:14:14,622
But he told me these
things about you.

1011
01:14:17,825 --> 01:14:19,694
What did he tell you?

1012
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:57,198
Goodnight.

1013
01:14:57,231 --> 01:14:58,232
Goodnight.

1014
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:19,887
What's wrong?

1015
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,489
I don't know.

1016
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:23,924
I thought I heard something.

1017
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:08,469
It was just the girl.

1018
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:12,573
I'll deal with her
in the morning.

1019
01:16:14,509 --> 01:16:15,309
What...

1020
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,114
Eileen...

1021
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:22,183
Oh my God.

1022
01:19:39,714 --> 01:19:40,615
Christina.

1023
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:42,449
Christina Bowden.

1024
01:19:42,483 --> 01:19:43,284
Christina.

1025
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:45,486
Get up.

1026
01:20:28,228 --> 01:20:29,830
And he just landed.

1027
01:20:29,863 --> 01:20:31,198
The state police has
got a search party

1028
01:20:31,231 --> 01:20:33,133
looking for the girl already.

1029
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:34,134
I think you should get over-

1030
01:20:34,168 --> 01:20:35,402
- You were in my house!

1031
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:37,639
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

1032
01:20:37,672 --> 01:20:38,540
No one comes in there!

1033
01:20:38,573 --> 01:20:39,840
Do you understand me?

1034
01:20:39,873 --> 01:20:41,475
Christina, something
happened last night.

1035
01:20:41,509 --> 01:20:42,711
I want you gone!

1036
01:20:44,211 --> 01:20:46,847
Terry Caldwell and his wife
were murdered last night.

1037
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,385
Lisa.

1038
01:20:51,418 --> 01:20:52,654
She wasn't in the house,

1039
01:20:52,687 --> 01:20:54,656
and I have people
looking for her.

1040
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:56,857
But I need you to
help me understand

1041
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:59,661
why someone would want
to hurt the Caldwells.

1042
01:20:59,694 --> 01:21:01,028
Someone?

1043
01:21:01,061 --> 01:21:02,664
This is her.

1044
01:21:02,697 --> 01:21:03,430
Can't you see that?

1045
01:21:03,464 --> 01:21:04,566
No, I can't.

1046
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:06,867
But it seems like you can,

1047
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,572
so please, help me understand
why she would do this?

1048
01:21:12,741 --> 01:21:13,440
I don't know.

1049
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:18,847
Christina, I have four people
dead in the last 24 hours,

1050
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:20,114
and they're all
connected to you.

1051
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:21,915
So you need to tell
me, what is going on!

1052
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:22,751
I don't know!

1053
01:21:32,794 --> 01:21:34,962
Where were you last night?

1054
01:21:37,131 --> 01:21:37,998
Fuck you.

1055
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:40,568
You didn't get home
'til after midnight.

1056
01:21:40,602 --> 01:21:41,468
Where were you?

1057
01:21:41,502 --> 01:21:42,804
I was looking for Lisa!

1058
01:21:42,837 --> 01:21:44,539
So you went looking
for her at the Caldwells?

1059
01:21:44,572 --> 01:21:46,073
This wasn't me, Jamie!

1060
01:21:46,106 --> 01:21:47,642
Right, it's Caulfield.

1061
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:50,477
And she somehow magically knows
everything about your life,

1062
01:21:50,512 --> 01:21:51,979
about Lisa, about Tom,

1063
01:21:52,012 --> 01:21:53,280
and she's killing everyone

1064
01:21:53,313 --> 01:21:54,849
who ever wronged
her special girl.

1065
01:21:57,985 --> 01:22:00,320
I've been sitting in
front of the wrong house.

1066
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:03,591
You were never in
danger, were you?

1067
01:22:06,828 --> 01:22:09,664
She could've killed you
back then, but she didn't,

1068
01:22:11,633 --> 01:22:14,001
because you were her favorite.

1069
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:18,773
That's why you're alive
and the others aren't.

1070
01:22:21,543 --> 01:22:23,778
You don't know
anything about me,

1071
01:22:23,812 --> 01:22:25,513
or what went on in that house.

1072
01:22:29,483 --> 01:22:32,052
I know when someone
is lying to me.

1073
01:22:35,824 --> 01:22:36,724
Tell me, Jamie.

1074
01:22:37,559 --> 01:22:38,992
Was Gerry Bailey lying to you

1075
01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:40,895
when he asked you
to come find me?

1076
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,898
Did he tell you he
was worried about me?

1077
01:22:46,835 --> 01:22:48,536
You don't think I know?

1078
01:22:49,804 --> 01:22:51,539
That old man drives by
my house once a week,

1079
01:22:51,573 --> 01:22:53,173
sends me birthday
cards in the mail,

1080
01:22:53,207 --> 01:22:55,643
and it's not because he
gives a shit about me.

1081
01:22:56,878 --> 01:22:58,479
It's because he feels guilty.

1082
01:22:58,513 --> 01:22:59,480
Well, fuck him!

1083
01:22:59,514 --> 01:23:00,849
He should feel guilty.

1084
01:23:03,383 --> 01:23:05,285
He was supposed to protect us,

1085
01:23:05,319 --> 01:23:08,690
he was supposed to save
us, but nobody came.

1086
01:23:09,891 --> 01:23:10,825
No one!

1087
01:23:13,928 --> 01:23:16,463
Or maybe you did
know he was lying,

1088
01:23:16,497 --> 01:23:18,131
and you came anyway,

1089
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:19,801
hoping you could prove to him

1090
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:22,202
that you were good enough
for his precious daughter.

1091
01:23:24,037 --> 01:23:26,741
Whatever you're here for,
it's not for me, is it?

1092
01:23:26,774 --> 01:23:29,744
Go home, Jamie, and stop
pretending like you care.

1093
01:24:23,497 --> 01:24:24,298
Lisa?

1094
01:24:27,902 --> 01:24:31,873
Lisa!

1095
01:24:31,906 --> 01:24:36,911
Lisa, are you in here?

1096
01:24:54,829 --> 01:24:55,630
Lisa?

1097
01:25:00,868 --> 01:25:04,271
Hey!

1098
01:25:04,304 --> 01:25:08,676
Hey, wake up, you
can't be up here.

1099
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:09,777
Hey!

1100
01:25:09,811 --> 01:25:10,945
Hey, wake up.

1101
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:23,123
Oh my God.

1102
01:25:23,156 --> 01:25:24,025
Katie.

1103
01:25:28,563 --> 01:25:31,131
What's wrong with you?

1104
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:54,589
Come on, run!

1105
01:26:01,095 --> 01:26:03,163
Come on, we have to go, now!

1106
01:26:04,732 --> 01:26:06,199
I can't.

1107
01:26:06,233 --> 01:26:08,036
I'm not leaving you.

1108
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:10,705
Christina!

1109
01:26:10,738 --> 01:26:11,539
Go, run!

1110
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:18,579
Christina!

1111
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,281
No!

1112
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:23,751
No!

1113
01:26:23,785 --> 01:26:26,587
Do
you know the rules?

1114
01:26:29,289 --> 01:26:31,092
Do you know the rules?

1115
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:32,325
No, no!

1116
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:33,861
Run!

1117
01:26:33,895 --> 01:26:34,696
Christina!

1118
01:26:38,066 --> 01:26:39,266
I'm not leaving you.

1119
01:26:39,299 --> 01:26:40,367
Ask
him why he hates you.

1120
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,268
What do
you think she says

1121
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:42,704
when she finds out yours?

1122
01:26:50,477 --> 01:26:51,445
Ask him why
he keeps you a secret.

1123
01:27:03,256 --> 01:27:06,326
Jesus, I'm
sure, because he tells me so.

1124
01:27:17,004 --> 01:27:18,940
Because he tells me so.

1125
01:27:21,809 --> 01:27:23,243
What the hell?

1126
01:27:26,514 --> 01:27:28,315
No one but the kid.

1127
01:27:33,121 --> 01:27:34,321
I saw her, Jamie.

1128
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:37,357
She was right in
front of my face.

1129
01:27:41,195 --> 01:27:42,029
Who's the boy?

1130
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:47,434
He was up here
yesterday with Lisa.

1131
01:27:47,467 --> 01:27:48,569
They were making
out or something,

1132
01:27:48,603 --> 01:27:49,604
I told him to leave.

1133
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:56,110
This is my fault.

1134
01:27:57,277 --> 01:27:59,113
I should've never
shown Lisa this place.

1135
01:28:01,649 --> 01:28:03,017
Why would she come here?

1136
01:28:05,153 --> 01:28:06,419
A mile and a
half of those woods

1137
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:07,855
is where we lived with her.

1138
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:10,357
Mother's house.

1139
01:28:11,324 --> 01:28:12,126
Mother?

1140
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:15,395
It's what we called her.

1141
01:28:16,631 --> 01:28:18,331
It's what she was to
me, to the others,

1142
01:28:18,365 --> 01:28:19,200
it's all we knew.

1143
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:21,636
When there was an evening Mass,

1144
01:28:21,669 --> 01:28:23,971
she would take us to the woods,

1145
01:28:24,005 --> 01:28:25,372
and we would sit in the dark,

1146
01:28:25,405 --> 01:28:27,508
not making a sound, and we
would listen to the choir.

1147
01:28:28,543 --> 01:28:29,476
It was beautiful.

1148
01:28:31,145 --> 01:28:31,913
Gave us hope.

1149
01:28:33,514 --> 01:28:36,316
It let me know that there was
a world outside that house.

1150
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:38,686
Christina, look.

1151
01:28:42,056 --> 01:28:43,724
I'm sorry about the four.

1152
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:47,028
But something does not add up.

1153
01:28:48,162 --> 01:28:49,697
Because if Caulfield
is doing this,

1154
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:52,200
then someone is helping her.

1155
01:28:52,233 --> 01:28:55,536
Someone who knows about
you, about Tom, about Lisa.

1156
01:28:56,838 --> 01:28:59,507
Do you have any idea who
could be helping her?

1157
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:02,210
Only one person.

1158
01:29:07,414 --> 01:29:08,216
Me.

1159
01:29:10,952 --> 01:29:12,553
What are you talking about?

1160
01:29:15,422 --> 01:29:17,424
I wrote to her when
she was in prison,

1161
01:29:18,793 --> 01:29:21,963
told her about Tom,
about the Caldwells.

1162
01:29:23,564 --> 01:29:24,899
I wrote her when I was 15,

1163
01:29:24,932 --> 01:29:28,435
and I wrote her a letter
every month since then.

1164
01:29:30,938 --> 01:29:31,739
Why?

1165
01:29:33,274 --> 01:29:34,108
I don't know.

1166
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:37,645
'Cause I wanted to
be a good person?

1167
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:40,915
'Cause I wanted to forgive her?

1168
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:44,652
Because I had no
one else to talk to?

1169
01:29:45,953 --> 01:29:48,656
No one else knew what
happened to me in that house.

1170
01:29:49,724 --> 01:29:50,958
No one else but her.

1171
01:29:53,327 --> 01:29:54,128
Jamie?

1172
01:30:08,175 --> 01:30:08,976
We found her.

1173
01:30:27,628 --> 01:30:28,396
Christina.

1174
01:30:30,097 --> 01:30:30,865
Christina.

1175
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:36,804
Maybe you don't need to do this.

1176
01:30:36,837 --> 01:30:37,638
Not right now.

1177
01:31:12,673 --> 01:31:14,742
Top of that ravine
must be 60 feet high.

1178
01:31:16,677 --> 01:31:18,813
In that dark, she'd
never have seen the drop.

1179
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:04,558
Christina.

1180
01:32:05,426 --> 01:32:06,193
Christina, wait.

1181
01:32:07,862 --> 01:32:08,596
I'm going home.

1182
01:32:10,064 --> 01:32:12,266
Let me get someone
to follow you home.

1183
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:13,601
We don't know where she is,

1184
01:32:13,634 --> 01:32:15,603
she could be waiting
for you right now.

1185
01:32:15,636 --> 01:32:16,937
I don't care.

1186
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:23,878
I'm gonna have to
call you back, Casey.

1187
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:25,012
No, Jamie, wait.

1188
01:32:25,046 --> 01:32:26,113
This is important.

1189
01:32:27,314 --> 01:32:29,250
You need to see
something on this tape.

1190
01:32:44,632 --> 01:32:46,600
Where are you?

1191
01:32:51,138 --> 01:32:53,974
I'm not running anymore!

1192
01:32:54,008 --> 01:32:55,009
Come get me!

1193
01:32:56,143 --> 01:32:57,945
I'm right here!

1194
01:33:02,316 --> 01:33:03,651
I'm right here!

1195
01:33:04,452 --> 01:33:07,254
Christina!

1196
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:24,638
I'm right here.

1197
01:33:24,672 --> 01:33:25,973
I'm right here.

1198
01:33:27,341 --> 01:33:28,409
Right here.

1199
01:33:28,442 --> 01:33:29,578
Christina?

1200
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:32,813
Is this a bad time?

1201
01:33:37,151 --> 01:33:37,952
No.

1202
01:33:38,819 --> 01:33:39,620
Come on in.

1203
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:45,626
Jesus loves me, this I know,

1204
01:33:47,361 --> 01:33:49,296
because the Bible-

1205
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:51,332
- I cleaned up the tape
and got the time code.

1206
01:33:51,365 --> 01:33:53,467
It's November 18th, 1998.

1207
01:33:54,702 --> 01:33:56,170
One week before
Christina escaped.

1208
01:33:56,203 --> 01:33:57,505
Yeah.

1209
01:33:57,539 --> 01:33:59,006
And all the other
girls in the house

1210
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:00,841
were dead at this point, right?

1211
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:02,343
Right.

1212
01:34:02,376 --> 01:34:03,545
Well, check out what happens

1213
01:34:03,578 --> 01:34:06,180
when you get to 12:31:42
on the time code.

1214
01:34:08,682 --> 01:34:11,652
Loves me, this I'm sure,
because he tells me so.

1215
01:34:11,685 --> 01:34:14,188
See that picture,
next to the timestamp?

1216
01:34:14,221 --> 01:34:15,289
Yeah.

1217
01:34:15,322 --> 01:34:17,526
It's not a picture,
that's a mirror.

1218
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:21,896
Because the Bible tells me so.

1219
01:34:27,268 --> 01:34:29,069
There's another
girl in that house.

1220
01:34:34,576 --> 01:34:37,278
So, I was coming
for the home visit,

1221
01:34:38,445 --> 01:34:39,548
but I got some news
on the way here,

1222
01:34:39,581 --> 01:34:41,348
and I'm afraid it's bad news.

1223
01:34:43,518 --> 01:34:44,653
I know you've put
a lot of effort

1224
01:34:44,685 --> 01:34:46,220
into this process with Lisa,

1225
01:34:47,421 --> 01:34:51,025
but unfortunately, I don't
think this is going to work out.

1226
01:34:51,058 --> 01:34:51,926
And why is that?

1227
01:34:53,093 --> 01:34:54,361
You lied to me.

1228
01:34:54,395 --> 01:34:55,763
You never told me
about being arrested

1229
01:34:55,796 --> 01:34:57,364
for assault in Florida.

1230
01:34:57,398 --> 01:34:59,500
I was a teenager.

1231
01:34:59,534 --> 01:35:00,701
I was sleepwalking.

1232
01:35:02,203 --> 01:35:04,772
You beat your roommate
with a broom handle.

1233
01:35:04,805 --> 01:35:08,342
The police report said she
needed to be hospitalized.

1234
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:09,544
You did that in your sleep?

1235
01:35:10,545 --> 01:35:11,946
And even if you did,

1236
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:14,014
I've got a newsflash
for you, Miss Bowden,

1237
01:35:14,048 --> 01:35:16,250
that's something you
needed to tell me.

1238
01:35:21,623 --> 01:35:22,489
She's dead.

1239
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:24,892
What?

1240
01:35:24,925 --> 01:35:25,560
What are you talking about?

1241
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:27,361
Lisa is dead.

1242
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:30,931
And if you would've done
your job, she'd be alive.

1243
01:35:30,965 --> 01:35:32,233
She would've been with me,

1244
01:35:32,266 --> 01:35:34,401
and she would've never
been in that house.

1245
01:35:34,435 --> 01:35:35,970
Oh my God.

1246
01:35:36,003 --> 01:35:37,938
She would be alive.

1247
01:35:37,972 --> 01:35:41,408
But instead she's dead,
and it's your fault.

1248
01:35:41,442 --> 01:35:43,277
Well, no, no it isn't.

1249
01:35:44,512 --> 01:35:47,047
If you just told me the
truth at the very beginning,

1250
01:35:47,081 --> 01:35:48,182
I could've helped you.

1251
01:35:49,517 --> 01:35:50,484
I'm sorry, Christina.

1252
01:35:50,518 --> 01:35:52,820
But this is your
fault, not mine.

1253
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:54,188
Newsflash...

1254
01:35:56,023 --> 01:35:58,325
That's not my fucking name.

1255
01:36:28,222 --> 01:36:29,023
No!

1256
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:30,991
No!

1257
01:36:49,476 --> 01:36:50,512
No!

1258
01:36:52,813 --> 01:36:53,581
No!

1259
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:27,742
She was my best friend.

1260
01:38:27,776 --> 01:38:29,209
She was everything I wasn't.

1261
01:38:29,243 --> 01:38:31,780
She was brave, and kind.

1262
01:38:33,914 --> 01:38:35,449
I wanted to be her, Jamie.

1263
01:38:38,653 --> 01:38:40,622
But instead, I got her killed.

1264
01:38:43,858 --> 01:38:45,693
There was a sixth
girl in that house.

1265
01:38:48,663 --> 01:38:49,463
Yes.

1266
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:53,868
The only one that
actually belonged here.

1267
01:38:56,003 --> 01:38:57,337
Katie Caulfield.

1268
01:38:58,807 --> 01:39:00,107
The serial killer's daughter.

1269
01:39:03,177 --> 01:39:05,012
Why didn't you tell someone?

1270
01:39:08,683 --> 01:39:10,284
Because I was afraid.

1271
01:39:12,386 --> 01:39:15,790
"It was my fault, it
was all my fault."

1272
01:39:15,824 --> 01:39:17,859
That's what she told
me, and I believed her.

1273
01:39:21,061 --> 01:39:23,363
But this is the last
secret of this house.

1274
01:39:26,734 --> 01:39:29,203
To this day, she's
still keeping a secret.

1275
01:39:29,236 --> 01:39:31,706
That's why she's
doing it, Jamie.

1276
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:33,508
The Caldwells knew, Tom knew.

1277
01:39:34,709 --> 01:39:36,711
But now everyone knows
she can't kill everyone.

1278
01:39:36,744 --> 01:39:37,846
Caulfield is dead.

1279
01:39:40,981 --> 01:39:42,650
They found her body
a few hours ago

1280
01:39:42,684 --> 01:39:44,953
in the woods outside
Ulster County.

1281
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:46,688
She'd been there
at least two days.

1282
01:39:46,721 --> 01:39:47,722
That's impossible!

1283
01:39:49,591 --> 01:39:51,693
Who would kill
Tom, the Caldwells.

1284
01:39:51,726 --> 01:39:53,026
Who would do this?

1285
01:39:58,999 --> 01:40:00,033
No!

1286
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:06,541
I'm sorry.

1287
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:10,845
But I need you to come with me.

1288
01:40:10,879 --> 01:40:12,680
Jamie, I didn't hurt anyone.

1289
01:40:14,849 --> 01:40:15,683
Then who did?

1290
01:40:17,852 --> 01:40:21,723
Jesus loves me, this I know,

1291
01:40:21,756 --> 01:40:24,124
because the Bible tells me so.

1292
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:28,262
Tell him
how old you are today.

1293
01:40:29,531 --> 01:40:31,866
I'm
10 years old today.

1294
01:40:34,234 --> 01:40:36,136
Ask
him why he hates you.

1295
01:40:39,072 --> 01:40:41,643
Ask him why he
keeps you a secret.

1296
01:40:53,955 --> 01:40:57,090
My parents
are lonely, but never alone,

1297
01:40:57,124 --> 01:40:59,426
for the Bible tells me so.

1298
01:41:09,003 --> 01:41:11,606
I know because he tells me so.

1299
01:41:14,074 --> 01:41:14,776
Arlene?

1300
01:41:19,581 --> 01:41:20,949
Arlene, did you hear that?

1301
01:41:25,152 --> 01:41:26,186
Dad?

1302
01:41:32,092 --> 01:41:34,062
Amy, call the police.

1303
01:41:34,094 --> 01:41:35,063
What's going on?

1304
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:36,330
Now!

1305
01:42:01,889 --> 01:42:04,959
Please, please
answer, please answer.

1306
01:42:12,734 --> 01:42:13,500
Amy.

1307
01:42:13,534 --> 01:42:14,301
Jamie.

1308
01:42:15,536 --> 01:42:17,105
Jamie.

1309
01:42:17,137 --> 01:42:18,606
Jamie, she's here, she shot dad.

1310
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:19,373
Who?

1311
01:42:19,406 --> 01:42:20,675
Who's dead?

1312
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:21,542
You have to come
here right now!

1313
01:42:21,576 --> 01:42:23,111
Amy!

1314
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:26,114
Help me!

1315
01:42:26,146 --> 01:42:27,381
Somebody help me!

1316
01:42:29,383 --> 01:42:30,384
Please help!

1317
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,521
Help!

1318
01:42:36,090 --> 01:42:38,559
Somebody please help me!

1319
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:18,425
Get out!

1320
01:44:18,458 --> 01:44:19,493
Get out!

1321
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,999
Get out of my house!

1322
01:44:32,339 --> 01:44:33,373
Get out!

1323
01:44:38,546 --> 01:44:39,346
Get out!

1324
01:44:41,381 --> 01:44:42,449
Get out!

1325
01:44:44,384 --> 01:44:46,754
Get out of my house!

1326
01:45:22,089 --> 01:45:24,592
Stay here, stay in the car.

1327
01:46:30,423 --> 01:46:32,093
Help!

1328
01:46:32,126 --> 01:46:37,131
Amy!

1329
01:46:37,632 --> 01:46:38,431
Help me!

1330
01:46:38,465 --> 01:46:39,634
I'm dying.

1331
01:46:39,667 --> 01:46:40,467
Amy?

1332
01:47:02,623 --> 01:47:03,423
Jamie.

1333
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:06,928
She took my baby.

1334
01:47:16,938 --> 01:47:17,805
Don't go anywhere.

1335
01:47:17,838 --> 01:47:18,739
Don't go anywhere!

1336
01:47:18,773 --> 01:47:20,508
Stay with me, Amy.

1337
01:47:20,541 --> 01:47:23,144
I need an ambulance,
12 Conners Lane.

1338
01:47:23,177 --> 01:47:24,779
Gerry Bailey's house!

1339
01:47:24,812 --> 01:47:25,846
Come on.

1340
01:47:29,884 --> 01:47:30,952
He's coming over here.

1341
01:47:30,985 --> 01:47:33,387
The ambulance is on its way.

1342
01:47:34,622 --> 01:47:36,489
Amy, Amy, stay with me.

1343
01:47:37,525 --> 01:47:38,326
Amy!

1344
01:47:45,967 --> 01:47:46,968
I'm sorry.

1345
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:51,072
I can't do this anymore.

1346
01:47:53,374 --> 01:47:57,078
I need to let you go,
and I need this to end.

1347
01:47:58,746 --> 01:47:59,547
Goodbye.

1348
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:41,015
She's yours.

1349
01:49:50,124 --> 01:49:52,126
She's a beautiful baby girl.

1350
01:49:53,994 --> 01:49:55,463
Just for you.

1351
01:49:55,496 --> 01:49:57,665
She's pure, and innocent.

1352
01:50:01,302 --> 01:50:04,171
Not like that trashy girl
you wanted to take in.

1353
01:50:06,006 --> 01:50:07,875
So now you have
everything you wanted.

1354
01:50:11,546 --> 01:50:13,548
You gonna say thank you?

1355
01:50:20,054 --> 01:50:23,491
Say thank you for everything
I ever did for you?

1356
01:50:23,525 --> 01:50:26,861
For everything I
sacrificed for you?

1357
01:50:26,894 --> 01:50:29,296
All of this is because of you!

1358
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:40,875
Christina!

1359
01:50:40,908 --> 01:50:43,043
Christina, where are you?

1360
01:50:45,146 --> 01:50:47,181
Say fucking thank you!

1361
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:55,689
It's okay, I'm here.

1362
01:50:55,723 --> 01:50:58,560
Can you tell me your name?

1363
01:50:58,593 --> 01:51:00,861
She's coming.

1364
01:51:02,229 --> 01:51:06,834
Now pick up that
perfect fucking baby

1365
01:51:06,867 --> 01:51:09,236
and say fucking thank you!

1366
01:51:17,244 --> 01:51:18,245
Thank you, Mother.

1367
01:51:27,622 --> 01:51:28,422
For everything.

1368
01:51:29,591 --> 01:51:32,259
For making me realize
it's not about me,

1369
01:51:32,293 --> 01:51:33,628
it's always been you.

1370
01:51:42,736 --> 01:51:46,340
You're just like your mother.

1371
01:51:46,373 --> 01:51:47,708
No.

1372
01:51:47,741 --> 01:51:48,809
Not like you.

1373
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:52,279
You're sick, and I'm not.

1374
01:51:53,247 --> 01:51:55,783
I know what love
is, and you don't.

1375
01:51:57,051 --> 01:51:59,787
And I know what it feels
like to lose everything

1376
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:01,455
that's ever mattered to me.

1377
01:52:05,392 --> 01:52:07,161
At least we have
that in common now.

1378
01:52:11,899 --> 01:52:13,801
Goodbye, Mother.

1379
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:28,650
Don't move!

1380
01:52:34,822 --> 01:52:37,324
You don't get
to run this time!

1381
01:53:21,536 --> 01:53:23,638
Are you okay?

1382
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:27,374
We're gonna get you and
your baby checked out.

1383
01:53:28,842 --> 01:53:30,210
Can you tell me your name?

1384
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:33,380
Katie.

1385
01:53:34,848 --> 01:53:35,750
My name is Katie.

1386
01:53:40,716 --> 01:53:45,716
