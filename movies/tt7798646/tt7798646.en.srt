3
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,286
<i>Billy, why are we doing this?</i>

4
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,957
<i>Oh, it's just a couple
of questions for posterity's sake.</i>

5
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,460
And you know how much work I got to do.

6
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,213
Just play along, Christina.

7
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,507
- Well...
- Fine. Go ahead.

8
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,927
Now, are you glad you came to New York?

9
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:53,887
Yes.

10
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,557
Do you miss Louisiana?

11
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,726
- Parts of it.
- Hmm.

12
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,980
- What parts?
- The good parts.

13
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,986
And what do you like about New York?

14
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,698
I like my work.

15
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,250
I like being a mother.

16
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,886
What are you thinking?

17
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:44,104
That I wish I was as good at love
as I am at working.

18
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,820
I wish I didn't leave people behind
so often.

19
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,917
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah</i>

20
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:09,545
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah</i>

21
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:16,762
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah</i>

22
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:22,851
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah</i>

23
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:27,856
<i>Darling, I have to be moved from afar</i>

24
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,816
<i>The truth is the only thing</i>

25
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,654
<i>Worth holding on to anymore</i>

26
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,657
- <i>Anymore</i>
- <i>Untie me</i>

27
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,951
<i>Let me loose from the cord</i>

28
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,787
<i>I'm so gone, so far</i>

29
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,456
<i>I deserve more</i>

30
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,959
- <i>More, I deserve more</i>
- <i>Yeah</i>

31
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,585
<i>I'm begging you</i>

32
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,963
- <i>I beg</i>
- <i>I'm begging you</i>

33
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,841
<i>Please come home</i>

34
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,718
<i>No one even begs anymore</i>

35
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,890
- <i>I'm begging you</i>
- <i>I beg</i>

36
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,643
<i>I'm begging you, please come home...</i>

37
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,160
- Hello?
- Hey.

38
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,454
- Uh, Isaac?
- You the reporter?

39
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,331
Yeah, Michael Block from <i>The Republic.</i>

40
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,334
- Come straight back to the kitchen.
- All right.

41
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,179
Hey. Thank you, again.

42
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,347
Yeah, sit down.

43
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,266
- All right.
- Mmm-hmm.

44
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,145
This will likely be
the best boiled crab you ever eaten.

45
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,772
Oh, no, I'm all right.
I ate on the plane.

46
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:54,318
I just offered you crab.
That's not the correct response.

47
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,947
Hey, um, do you mind if I record?

48
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,741
Your story's about BP?

49
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:01,909
Pointe à la Hache.

50
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:06,079
Uh, Katrina, the oil spill,
how it kind of affected things there.

51
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,666
So, did you always fish?

52
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,421
Well, I'm third generation,
but I was in the military.

53
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,382
Before that, I was working
on an oil refinery for Gulf Oil.

54
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,469
What was it like working for Gulf Oil?

55
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,888
- They fired me.
- Why?

56
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,015
I refused to pump dirty water
into the river.

57
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:30,312
It took us generations to go
from sharecropping to independent.

58
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,564
They destroyed us with the oil spill.

59
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,778
This was my wife.

60
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,322
Whoa.

61
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,075
You married?

62
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,327
Uh, I... just got out of something.

63
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,996
She, um...
She called while I was flying, man.

64
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,208
She... She told me,
"Don't even bother stopping by."

65
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,377
Well...

66
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,170
She probably doesn't mean that.

67
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,005
Ah, she's probably right.

68
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,007
Who's this?

69
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,801
Christina Eames.

70
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,345
She took these other photos.

71
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,514
That was me in '84.

72
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,809
- She's great.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,143
- She from here?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,896
She moved to New York.
She's a photographer.

75
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,108
Hmm. That was...
Does she have more like this?

76
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,652
Um, I'm sure she does.

77
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,574
We lost contact, uh,
after she took off, or...

78
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,951
I let her leave.

79
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,371
Thirty years later,
still trying to figure that out.

80
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,332
Why don't you just look her up?

81
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,001
Too much time done passed.

82
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,004
- Hmm.
- I don't recommend getting older.

83
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,592
Less people to talk to,
more time to go over every regret.

84
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,014
<i>My Mae, There are two letters.</i>

85
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,060
<i>Please read yours first before
sharing the second with your father.</i>

86
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,770
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

87
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,394
<i>My Mae,</i>

88
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,314
<i>Cancer is a creature
lurching through my body.</i>

89
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,943
<i>I waited far too long
to face it squarely.</i>

90
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,363
<i>I need to write my way
out of the mess I've made.</i>

91
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,658
<i>I hope you won't judge me too harshly.</i>

92
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,788
<i>Sometimes the heart
can be so full of love,</i>

93
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,209
<i>it's like a weight on your chest
making it impossible to move.</i>

94
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,212
<i>That's how I felt when I was with him.</i>

95
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,743
<i>I don't want to write this down</i>

96
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,537
<i>I want to tell you
how I feel right now</i>

97
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,333
<i>I don't want to take no time
to write this down</i>

98
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,835
<i>I want to tell you
how I feel right now</i>

99
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,420
<i>Hey...</i>

100
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,088
What's up? Get those photos I sent you?

101
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,757
- Yeah, I got 'em.
- All right.

102
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:31,261
<i>For you or me, life is not promised</i>

103
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,681
<i>Tomorrow may never appear</i>

104
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,768
<i>You better hold this very moment</i>

105
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,895
- <i>Very close to you</i>
- <i>Right now</i>

106
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,563
<i>Very close to you, so close to you...</i>

107
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,318
- Oh. How was Louisiana?
- Good.

108
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,278
And how is the girl?

109
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,497
- Huh. It didn't work out.
- Don't... No.

110
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,251
<i>Shine your light
for the world to see...</i>

111
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,420
Oh, coffee for me. Look at you sucking up.

112
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,715
Hey, have you ever noticed
how ugly this place actually is?

113
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,800
Mmm-mmm.

114
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,095
It's bleak and confining
and it's claustrophobic.

115
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,472
It don't look that bad to me.

116
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,182
Actually, it's fine,
it's a really nice building,

117
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,518
but look, they won't give me
anything to write.

118
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,602
Yeah.

119
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,896
Why don't you do me a favor

120
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,691
and, uh, look up this photographer
named Christina Eames.

121
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,152
- Cool?
- Oh, all right.

122
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,571
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

123
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,873
Mae?

124
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,708
- Yeah.
- Hey.

125
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,002
Michael Block from <i>The Republic.</i>

126
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,795
Hey.

127
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,386
Uh, after you called,

128
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,097
I pulled all my mother's photos
from Pointe à la Hache.

129
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,182
Oh, thanks.

130
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,018
Yeah, since she died,
I've been going through all her things.

131
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,980
We weren't expecting it.
She didn't tell anyone she was sick.

132
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:06,940
Oh, I'm sorry.

133
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,279
I saw some of Christina's work
in New Orleans.

134
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,240
Um, the guy I was profiling
showed me a picture of her.

135
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,036
- She hated when people took photos of her.
- Oh.

136
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,798
He said the relationship ended
after she left Louisiana.

137
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,469
Well, she wasn't good at staying anywhere.

138
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,056
- Or with anyone. Just ask my father.
- Mmm.

139
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,809
Um, maybe we shouldn't be good
at staying places.

140
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,521
That sounds very mobile.

141
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,981
Well, maybe.

142
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,610
So I take it you're not walking down
any aisles anytime soon?

143
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,321
Nope. Uh, what about you?

144
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:59,159
Me? I broke up with my last boyfriend
after he proposed.

145
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,036
You got commitment issues?

146
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,330
Wow.

147
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,665
Tact.

148
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,167
You from the City?

149
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,419
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

150
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,506
And how long have you been
at Queens Museum?

151
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,509
I've been assistant curator for two years.

152
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,720
What about you?
How long have you been at <i>The Republic?</i>

153
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,432
Uh, too long, probably.
Like, four years.

154
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,817
Oh, wait a minute. This is, uh, Isaac.

155
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,443
You know him?

156
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,406
I don't know. I...

157
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,160
I went to Louisiana once
as a child, but...

158
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,788
Yeah.

159
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,042
You know, uh...

160
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,464
Uh, maybe we should talk more.

161
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,009
You know, I mean...
maybe you could talk,

162
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,929
tell me more about Christina
and, uh, Pointe à la Hache.

163
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,641
Uh, I could call you.

164
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,036
On your one day off,
why would you choose to come back here?

165
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,455
This was supposed to be a date.

166
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,335
We should go to New Orleans this weekend.

167
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,170
Why?

168
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,922
You question anything that's fun.

169
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,382
What's so fun
about New Orleans?

170
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,637
The people are different.
And we could dance.

171
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:47,184
<i>Until I had them memorized...</i>

172
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,313
We could dance right here.

173
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,024
If you don't want to go,
I'll just go with Denise and Peter.

174
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,901
You can stay here with Ashley Prentiss.

175
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,486
Why are you bringing up Ashley?

176
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,197
Because she is always
hanging around the harbor for no reason,

177
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,406
trying to get your attention.

178
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,033
That's not true.

179
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,619
I'm sure she'd be happy to stay home.

180
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,042
<i>How much I do</i>

181
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,295
<i>Do love you...</i>

182
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,214
When do you want to go to New Orleans?

183
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,490
Christina.

184
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:49,246
- Why are you slamming my door?
- Sorry. I... I didn't mean to.

185
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,587
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

186
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,547
You should wear more dresses.

187
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:01,800
Where'd you go?

188
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,469
To the harbor, with Isaac.

189
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,263
Isn't that exciting?

190
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,932
I told him
he needs to do better.

191
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,478
He's just like his father.

192
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,731
What's wrong with his father?

193
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,940
He ain't got nothing.

194
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:21,278
Ain't never gonna have nothing.
How many times I got to tell you that?

195
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,616
We're just friends.

196
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,783
"Just friends."

197
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,206
"Just friends."

198
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,167
Aren't you sick of telling that sad story?

199
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,586
What's so sad about being friends?

200
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,797
- You being rude to your mama?
- No, ma'am.

201
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,716
Violet.

202
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,636
I'm not gonna sit out here
by myself all night.

203
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,138
I'm talking to my daughter.

204
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,766
Trying to teach her something.

205
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,278
Night, baby.

206
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,036
You know, it's so hard
being in her apartment right now, Dad.

207
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,039
I just remember being there,

208
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,209
desperate for her attention,
not getting it.

209
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,673
Thank God that you were there
to make my lunches,

210
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,551
'cause she didn't even notice
when I started smoking weed.

211
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:26,760
Well, I noticed.

212
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,554
- You did?
- Yeah.

213
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,305
- You never said anything.
- How could I say anything?

214
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,307
You were stealing it from your mother.

215
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,689
What if I'm just like her?

216
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,274
You're not.

217
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,445
Did you read the letter?

218
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,949
I couldn't at first.

219
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,618
I just don't understand why
she couldn't tell me about her life

220
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,078
when she was still alive.

221
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:58,625
Maybe to help you look at her
in another way.

222
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,711
What other way?

223
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,881
She wasn't just your mother.

224
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,633
At some point,
you're going to have to forgive her

225
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,803
and realize she was just a woman...

226
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,307
with flaws.

227
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,767
A lot of flaws.

228
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,062
Yeah.

229
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,235
I'll get it. I'll get it.

230
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,739
- Uncle Michael!
- Whoa. Hey.

231
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,077
Look, we'll be just fine.

232
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,747
Yeah, Harlem won't get that much landfall
from the hurricane.

233
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,874
Uh, I did that job interview.

234
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,002
Feel like it went well. I might get it.

235
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,296
Wait, what job?

236
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,549
Man, do you listen
to anything we ever talk about?

237
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,594
Brother, I'll be trying to, but you know
I got two kids under 10. Come on, now.

238
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,305
Associated Press in London.

239
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,806
Oh.

240
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,603
You guys know how it is in the City.
It's... I'm feeling caught up, you know?

241
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,689
Sometimes it feels like an accomplishment
just to get to the subway.

242
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,275
Plus, Tessa is saying
I'm incapable of any kind of change.

243
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,694
Wait, I'm sorry.
So you want to move because of Tessa?

244
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,904
I'm not saying that.

245
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,656
I mean, it kind of sound like that.

246
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,159
- You hungry?
- Why would you ask him that?

247
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,036
Don't give him no food.
We don't need to feed him.

248
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,746
- Why not?
- What you mean, "Why not?"

249
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,415
First of all, he a grown man, okay?
And groceries are expensive.

250
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,211
Mike, let me ask you this.
All right? And I'm serious.

251
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,713
Are you actually done with Tessa?
Are y'all finished?

252
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:28,464
Oh, we're finished.
Yes, finished-finished.

253
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,384
Good.

254
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,720
- Kyle.
- What? Okay, he was wasting her time.

255
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,807
I wasn't wasting her time, was I?

256
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,642
Definitely.
You was definitely wasting her time.

257
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,395
- Mom! Dad!
- Mom, she took my book!

258
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,564
Sandrine and Sofia.

259
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,941
Okay, look, look, how's the story coming?

260
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,736
I interviewed this man named Isaac.
He reminds me of Dad.

261
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,197
Uh, he kind of introduced me
to this woman.

262
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,949
- Kind of?
- Yeah.

263
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,910
She, um... She's the daughter
of somebody that he knew.

264
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,162
Um, she's a curator at the Queens Museum.

265
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,208
- Come on, now. Already?
- "Already" what, man?

266
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,003
You know what I'm talking about, man.
Already? You, like, like her already?

267
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,254
You trying to date somebody again?

268
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,423
It ain't my fault
I meet people while I work.

269
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,551
And, uh, she's interesting, you know?

270
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,179
- Oh, so she's interesting.
- Yeah.

271
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,724
She's got a lot to unpack.
Her mom just died.

272
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,643
So, you're attracted to her
'cause her mama died?

273
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:22,728
- Look...
- No, I...

274
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,688
Beside the point.
Turn around. Let me talk to you.

275
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,233
Why don't you do me a favor, okay?
Take some time to yourself, okay?

276
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,653
Figure out what you really want to do
instead of jumping into something again.

277
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,822
I don't know. I'd like to see her again.

278
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,450
Oh, those girls
are gonna drive me crazy.

279
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,874
<i>I didn't know much about photography</i>

280
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,375
<i>when she started taking pictures,</i>

281
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,545
<i>but I knew I liked the way she saw me.</i>

282
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,089
<i>Better than I really was.</i>

283
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,557
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

284
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,644
<i>My ego probably
held me back the most,</i>

285
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,813
<i>why I couldn't make it work
with Christina.</i>

286
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,942
<i>I didn't know how to be with a woman
that I had to keep up with.</i>

287
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,447
<i>What would you
have done differently?</i>

288
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,952
<i>I would've gone after her.</i>

289
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,042
- Yo.
- What's up, man?

290
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,503
Uh, you want to see a movie?

291
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,967
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, you.

292
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,093
All right.

293
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:20,679
Let's do it.

294
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,773
<i>Thinking ahead of time</i>

295
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,775
<i>Why don't you spend the night?</i>

296
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,319
<i>I know you love me</i>

297
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,823
<i>Pick up and roll the dice</i>

298
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,783
<i>Reading between the lines</i>

299
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,285
<i>I know you love me</i>

300
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,706
<i>We can book a flight</i>

301
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,666
<i>Wake up in paradise</i>

302
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,210
<i>Sun up above us</i>

303
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,547
<i>Tell me you down to ride</i>

304
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,633
<i>And you can bet your life</i>

305
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,301
<i>No one above you</i>

306
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,188
<i>Said hold on</i>

307
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:14,191
<i>Can't stop love...</i>

308
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,027
Oh, I see what you're here for.

309
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,195
Nah, you don't see nothing.

310
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,279
What you talking about?

311
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,698
What's he doing here?

312
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,450
Who?

313
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,827
Well, now, hold on. Be right back.

314
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,496
Yeah, I'm gonna go talk to her.

315
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,206
- I'll meet you upstairs.
- All right.

316
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,460
Hey, Mae.

317
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,382
<i>Can't stop love</i>

318
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,220
<i>And as long as you're with me</i>

319
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,806
<i>I'm definitely...</i>

320
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,336
- I was blown away.
- Are you being sarcastic?

321
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:23,427
Oh, he's got some follow-up questions.

322
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,681
You gonna help me out?

323
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,142
Uh, as long as
I don't have to talk to his friend.

324
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,311
So, you're not gonna help me out?

325
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,062
Fine.

326
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:38,984
He's cute in an innocent-looking way.
He's kind of dewy. It's refreshing.

327
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,028
What is wrong with you?

328
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,948
I'd rather be here.

329
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:46,742
- Yep.
- Oh.

330
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:48,327
I need a drink. Are you coming?

331
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,330
Yeah.

332
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,250
I didn't know you were coming.

333
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,128
Well, you were supposed
to invite me, right?

334
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:01,048
I'm sorry. Next time.

335
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,382
Uh-huh.

336
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,009
How's your article coming?

337
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,179
It's all right, you know.
It's kind of moving slowly.

338
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,181
- How come?
- 'Cause, uh, well, you know,

339
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,475
sometimes good things
take time to develop.

340
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,689
- How do you know Michael?
- We work together.

341
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:20,692
- Are you a writer?
- Kind of.

342
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,110
Why "kind of"?

343
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,195
I'm an intern.

344
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,863
An intern.

345
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,199
Yeah, for now.

346
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,869
How old are you?

347
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:32,538
Why does it matter?

348
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,957
Of course it matters legally.

349
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,711
I'm a solid 25... in a few months.

350
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,007
How old are you?

351
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,636
That's none of your business.

352
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,472
What did you think about the movie?

353
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:53,767
Uh, to be honest,
I was a little distracted.

354
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,270
- What?
- I...

355
00:23:56,353 --> 00:24:00,065
So I kept running back in my mind
how you might respond,

356
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,359
uh, to me asking you for a drink after.

357
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,778
So, that was you asking me?

358
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,321
That was elaborate.

359
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,739
In my mind, it wasn't that forward.

360
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:10,742
You know what I mean?
It was more... smoother than that.

361
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,369
I was supposed to call you, I thought.

362
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,954
Yeah, you were supposed to.

363
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,498
But you didn't.

364
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:19,293
Well, I can't leave
my girl Rachel behind, so...

365
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,502
Ah.

366
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,713
Oh, it look like Rachel already left.

367
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:25,924
Wow.

368
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:28,844
- She's a great friend.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

369
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,597
- She just disappear when you need her to.
- Just... Yeah.

370
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,307
- I like Kanye.
- Yeah?

371
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,351
But I'm just concerned
that he don't care about music no more.

372
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,312
- He does not.
- He don't care about us.

373
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:39,396
That's a valid...

374
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,106
- He does not care about us anymore.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

375
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,233
He cares about interior design.

376
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:44,735
Like, when did he get into that?

377
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:48,071
Like, I'm not trying to buy
Kanye pillows, you know?

378
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:51,366
- That would be fine, actually.
- That would be. I actually wouldn't mind.

379
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,952
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay, what about Drake?

380
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,039
Drake, okay. See, Drake, for me...

381
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,541
- Drake is like the homey.
- Yeah.

382
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,960
Like, you know, he's like a friend
at school who you know.

383
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:04,546
- And who knows us. That's what...
- Who knows us.

384
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,340
That's what I like about him.
He's just in tune.

385
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,799
- Yeah.
- You know, he's, like,

386
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:11,345
in tune with his feelings
and my feelings, your feelings...

387
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,306
Oh, no, you didn't.

388
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,058
- Sorry. I...
- No, you didn't.

389
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,769
I'm just bored by the sentimentality,
all that.

390
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,187
- Okay, who do you like?
- But, uh...

391
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,397
- Kendrick.
- Oh, no.

392
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:25,150
- Kendrick is my dude, for sure.
- I'm so sorry.

393
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,069
What? You're telling me
you don't like Kendrick?

394
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,196
No, I love...
No, I think he's great. I just...

395
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,490
Man, I'm about to flip this table over.

396
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,076
No, hear me out. I just...
He makes me feel guilty.

397
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,328
- Wait, how so?
- 'Cause I can't...

398
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,915
I just feel like, uh, everybody
can't be a change in the world.

399
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,375
- Everybody can't do that.
- Oh, okay.

400
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,043
- It's too ambitious.
- All right. Mmm-hmm.

401
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,837
- You know?
- You know what?

402
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,797
Now that I think about it,
that is kind of ambitious.

403
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,090
- Right?
- We gonna be all right.

404
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,174
- It's unfair.
- Yeah.

405
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,926
- What if I don't want to be all right?
- Right.

406
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,886
- Who knows if we're gonna be all right?
- Who knows that?

407
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,055
Mmm. Wow.

408
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:59,226
Uh, see,
I'm trying to think of how to...

409
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,270
Trying to say something that,
you know...

410
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,021
Uh, just trying to be honest and...

411
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:05,023
Oh, uh, being honest is hard for you?

412
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,483
Mmm-mmm.

413
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:10,070
I don't want to say the same thing
that I've said to another woman.

414
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,323
- You know?
- Are there a lot of other women?

415
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,075
No, there's a lot of first dates.

416
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,786
Yeah, I'm terrible at first dates.
I just...

417
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,871
Huh.

418
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:23,000
No, I just don't know whether to be
vulnerable, aloof, funny.

419
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,543
Why don't you just be yourself?

420
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,545
I don't know who that is.

421
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,006
- No, maybe I'm just a collection...
- Fair enough.

422
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,925
...of wrap dresses
and Kehinde Wiley prints.

423
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,051
I don't think so.

424
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,555
You ever wonder if we're just...

425
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,934
If we're just who we're around
in the moment?

426
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,395
I would think that it's important
that we pay attention

427
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,189
to who we surround ourselves with, then.

428
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,442
True.

429
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,485
Yeah.

430
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,780
What?

431
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:59,620
I'm wondering if it's not
too early in the night to kiss you.

432
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:32,319
It wasn't too early.

433
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,238
Ah. I see.

434
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,579
What was it like?

435
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:46,208
I don't know.
It felt like we... kissed before.

436
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,419
Yeah, and he called me right after.

437
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:50,504
To say what?

438
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,173
To say that he thought that I was...

439
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:56,969
Thought that you were what?

440
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:00,806
Special.

441
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:04,601
See? This is why
I can't tell you anything.

442
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,270
I knew I shouldn't have told you.

443
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,272
- Why do you keep doing this?
- Doing what?

444
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,649
You know. You act like you all in, right?

445
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,277
And it don't even last longer
than what, 12 weeks?

446
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,987
All right, well, what about Tessa?

447
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,114
What do you mean, "What about Tessa?"
Come on, bro.

448
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,074
That only lasted 'cause
you didn't have to see her every day.

449
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,868
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

450
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:25,372
And by the way, thank you so much
for bailing on me after the movie.

451
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,750
Oh, Andy and I were just pawns last night.

452
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,836
We ditched you, and then I ditched him.

453
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,087
Okay.

454
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,684
Where are you going?

455
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,311
New Orleans.

456
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,478
With who?

457
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:50,439
Denise and Peter.

458
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,065
Who else?

459
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:58,989
Who else is going?

460
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,116
Isaac.

461
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,493
I'm spending the night.

462
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,167
What are you planning to do?

463
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,085
- In New Orleans?
- No.

464
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:15,339
Christina, I'm asking what you planning
to do with your life.

465
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,384
You can't just walk around town
taking pictures.

466
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:22,513
How you plan to make money?

467
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:24,181
Isaac can't take care of you.

468
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,349
I don't want him to take care of me.

469
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,684
- You expect me to keep taking care of you?
- No.

470
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,108
You're getting too old to live with me.

471
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,241
Are you telling me I need to leave?

472
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:49,790
I'm saying you'll probably be
more comfortable living alone.

473
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:56,046
You should start looking
for a place that's yours.

474
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,002
Come on, Christina.

475
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:38,088
Why are you yelling at me, Denise?

476
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,339
'Cause you late.

477
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,967
Nice to see you too, Peter.

478
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,596
<i>But it's making me weak</i>

479
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,682
<i>I'm not your superwoman</i>

480
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:54,354
You okay?

481
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:57,107
<i>I'm not the kind of girl
that you can let down</i>

482
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,484
<i>And think that everything's okay</i>

483
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:03,155
<i>Boy, I am only human...</i>

484
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,331
What's up with you, baby?

485
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,594
- <i>Ain't nobody</i>
- <i>Nobody</i>

486
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,013
- <i>Loves me better</i>
- <i>Loves me better</i>

487
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,891
<i>Makes me happy, makes me feel...</i>

488
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:14,059
Marry me.

489
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,855
- We've had this conversation.
- We're having it again.

490
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,481
- Here?
- Yes.

491
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:21,733
It's time.

492
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,652
I told you I'm not ready.

493
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:29,199
If you're not gonna marry me,
then I have other demands.

494
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,451
What kind of demands?

495
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:37,332
- You've had too much to drink.
- I'm just getting started.

496
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,626
<i>I feel like no one could feel...</i>

497
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,880
<i>If this world were mine</i>

498
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:47,050
<i>I would place at your feet</i>

499
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,471
<i>All that I own</i>

500
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:54,183
<i>You've been so good to me</i>

501
00:32:56,018 --> 00:33:02,107
<i>If this world were mine</i>

502
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:07,613
<i>I'd give you the flowers</i>

503
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:11,283
<i>The birds and the bees</i>

504
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:15,329
<i>And with your love beside me</i>

505
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,999
<i>That would be all I need</i>

506
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:23,003
<i>If this world were</i>

507
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:27,966
<i>Mine</i>

508
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,093
<i>I'd give you</i>

509
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:34,848
<i>Anything</i>

510
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:40,729
<i>Oh...</i>

511
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,775
<i>Every sky would be blue</i>

512
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,694
<i>As long as you're</i>

513
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:50,822
<i>Loving me</i>

514
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,868
- <i>Baby</i>
- <i>Baby</i>

515
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:59,206
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

516
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,376
<i>It would be yours</i>

517
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:08,674
<i>If you'll believe</i>

518
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:17,431
<i>We are in the financial district</i>

519
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:19,268
<i>and this storm is promising
to be a major event.</i>

520
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,562
<i>This is a transitional storm system,</i>

521
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,648
<i>which means it's guaranteed to be
an absolutely perfect storm.</i>

522
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,609
<i>A tropical depression
that morphs into a severe storm...</i>

523
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:28,735
Whoa.

524
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,696
Yeah. All right.

525
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:34,241
- What?
- Nothing.

526
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,244
Then why you just look like
you pulled out a win in overtime?

527
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,248
Where you going?

528
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:45,043
- Downtown.
- Mary's about to make landfall.

529
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,295
Yeah, I don't think it's as bad
as people are saying.

530
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,922
You know, it's probably closer
to, like, Hurricane Irene.

531
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:51,091
Yeah.

532
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,467
What?

533
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,597
Rachel wants me to come over later.

534
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,390
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

535
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,017
See, there's something
about these hurricane,

536
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,186
I think they just cause people
to make rash decisions.

537
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,771
I hope so.

538
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:08,358
Thirsty.

539
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,528
You are thirsty.
Hey, somebody get him some water.

540
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:14,698
I'm good.

541
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,077
I've been here all day.

542
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:21,538
You know they closed the museum,

543
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,583
told us to stay home
until the storm clears tonight.

544
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:27,878
Huh.

545
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,757
"Al Green, <i>I'm Still in Love with You."</i>

546
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,676
- Oh, I love that album.
- Yeah.

547
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:40,432
All right, we should bust a move,
so that way we don't end up being stuck.

548
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:43,519
Trains might stop running.

549
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:45,437
I thought you were brave.

550
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:49,066
We're in an evacuation zone, so...

551
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,360
Yeah, so why'd you come?

552
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,029
'Cause you're in an evacuation zone.

553
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:57,991
I'm gonna grab some things.

554
00:35:58,075 --> 00:35:59,535
Let's go.

555
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,958
What, you, um,
you need a little help with that?

556
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,459
Getting it into your spot?

557
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:09,795
Oh, so you're actually trying to help?

558
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,631
You know,
I can do a little bit of something.

559
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:15,300
Okay, do a little bit of this.

560
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,511
Here. It's nothing. It's nothing.

561
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,179
Oh, it's...

562
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,306
Oh.

563
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,101
We cannot forget the essentials.

564
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:26,728
- I like the way you think.
- Now you already know.

565
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:32,651
Thanks.

566
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,869
Wow. This is a nice place.

567
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:47,958
- I'll take that.
- Oh, thank you.

568
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:58,260
You know, uh,
Andy and Rachel got together.

569
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,972
- No, they didn't.
- Yes, they did.

570
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,765
She's a liar.

571
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,229
Do you want something to drink?

572
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,398
Yeah. Whiskey, please.

573
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,984
- You want ice?
- Put them rocks on that.

574
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:16,945
- Thank you.
- Sure.

575
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:24,453
Oh, this is cool.

576
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,704
Oh, I never use it.

577
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:27,372
Then why do you have it?

578
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,833
Uh, my dad gave it to me.

579
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,585
Mmm.

580
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:34,046
- Does it work?
- It should.

581
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,215
Okay.

582
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:39,134
Let's see what I can do.

583
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,099
Yeah.

584
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,729
Al Green, my guy.

585
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:11,583
Oh.

586
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:14,169
That's a bad boy right there.

587
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:15,754
Mmm-hmm.

588
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:25,097
<i>Lay your head</i>

589
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,309
<i>Lay your head...</i>

590
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,395
Oh, yes. Good idea.

591
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,729
- You too?
- Yeah.

592
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,773
Hit me with a little... Da-da-da-da.

593
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:36,233
- Ah.
- Right there. Yeah.

594
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:40,404
<i>Hold your warm...</i>

595
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,783
Have you ever cheated on anyone?

596
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:46,410
No.

597
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:50,956
But I did date a woman
that was in a relationship once.

598
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,374
- Not with you.
- No.

599
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,461
Well, so it's not as bad as cheating,
but dishonest.

600
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:58,297
Hmm.

601
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:01,758
Yeah. She was much older.

602
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,596
- How much older?
- Yeah, she was 42.

603
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,015
- How old were you?
- Twenty-three.

604
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,976
Oh, yeah. Don't do that.

605
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,811
'Cause she pursued me, all right?

606
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:14,354
Oh, so that's the sole reason?

607
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:17,274
Well, and she could cook, you know.

608
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:18,775
- Cook?
- Mmm-hmm.

609
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,236
Cooking what? What was she cooking?

610
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,487
Anything I wanted.

611
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,574
And... sex, too.

612
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:29,828
I mean, she wanted it all the time,
no matter where we were.

613
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:31,038
Anytime, anyplace.

614
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,832
But one time, I had to fight her off
in an alleyway.

615
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:35,876
'Cause I don't do outdoors like that.

616
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,669
- Oh.
- I'm not...

617
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:39,796
Whatever.

618
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,590
Yeah, she couldn't get enough
of my youth.

619
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:43,675
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.

620
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:55,896
Okay.

621
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,523
Ooh.

622
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:09,368
Oh.

623
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,745
Okay.

624
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:14,206
Yeah.

625
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,499
<i>Baby...</i>

626
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:19,419
Come over here and dance with me.

627
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,630
Mmm. Nah.

628
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:22,714
Really?

629
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:24,925
Nah, you come back over here.

630
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:30,180
Please come back over here.

631
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:33,308
<i>Whoa, baby</i>

632
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:37,729
<i>Why did it take so long?</i>

633
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,523
<i>Whoa, baby</i>

634
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,277
<i>Only made my love grow strong</i>

635
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,487
<i>Baby</i>

636
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:49,074
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

637
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:51,577
<i>I'm so glad you're mine</i>

638
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,789
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

639
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:58,542
<i>When darkness gather round me...</i>

640
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,420
Why you got your head down
like you praying?

641
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:05,174
'Cause I might need to.

642
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,179
What would you pray for?

643
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,642
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...</i>

644
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:16,977
Willpower.

645
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:22,441
Why don't we just blame it on the storm?

646
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:06,985
<i>Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa</i>

647
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:14,910
<i>Needed some Ricolas</i>

648
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:19,331
<i>Stepped in CVS</i>

649
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:22,835
<i>Saw you in the corner</i>

650
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:26,839
<i>I was looking a mess</i>

651
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:31,468
<i>You didn't notice</i>

652
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:34,930
<i>Jason was instigating</i>

653
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:39,393
<i>I wanna bring you closer</i>

654
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:44,815
<i>Tired of waiting</i>

655
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:52,489
- <i>Tired...</i>
- <i>Tired of waiting</i>

656
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:02,332
<i>Ooh</i>

657
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:06,628
<i>Ooh</i>

658
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:10,215
<i>Ooh</i>

659
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,261
<i>Ooh</i>

660
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:37,159
What?

661
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,725
Excuse me. Excuse me.

662
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,445
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

663
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:18,325
Hey.

664
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:22,287
Going uptown.

665
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:23,372
- Good?
- Get in.

666
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:49,439
Ooh. Ah.

667
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:50,732
- Come on, come on.
- Hey.

668
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:53,443
Oh.

669
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:55,904
What's up, boy? Hey.

670
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:57,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

671
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:58,115
This is Mae.

672
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,199
- Hi, Mae.
- Nice to meet you.

673
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:00,325
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

674
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:01,410
Let me take your jackets.

675
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:02,744
- Hi.
- Yeah, yeah, come on, y'all.

676
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:03,954
Give me your coats.

677
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:05,038
Stay on the stairs.

678
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:06,582
- Go get a towel, baby.
- They're very wet.

679
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:08,083
- Okay.
- Yeah, get a towel.

680
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,877
- It's right here.
- Thank you.

681
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,003
You're welcome.

682
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,172
How about some wine?

683
00:45:13,255 --> 00:45:14,673
- Oh.
- Yes, please.

684
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,341
I am talking to Miss Mae, thank you.

685
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:19,469
- I would love some. Thank you.
- Okay.

686
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:24,141
- What is that?
- A flying pig.

687
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,144
Hey, man, look what happened.
Man, you were supposed to be here earlier.

688
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:28,937
Yeah, I got stuck at her place.

689
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:31,940
I'm sure.

690
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:35,402
She's so nice.

691
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:39,406
- Why do you look like that?
- Look like what?

692
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:44,161
Like you have a concussion.
Or, like, she's Yoruba and knows voodoo.

693
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:45,245
Okay.

694
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:46,914
Mmm-hmm.
Look at him, baby. He's in love.

695
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:48,790
I... I never said that, all right?

696
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:50,042
Brother, you ain't got to say it.

697
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,544
I can see it all over your face
with that sappy-ass look.

698
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:54,838
- It's embarrassing.
- Leave him alone.

699
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,215
Yeah, leave me alone.

700
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:59,510
What? What? Baby, you're the one that said
that she's Ya-rooba, uh, Yor-ooba...

701
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:01,303
- Yoruba.
- Yoruba.

702
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,931
First of all, uh, she's not Yoruba.

703
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:07,726
And what's that got to do with anything?
I just meant that she was really nice.

704
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:09,811
- Yeah. Okay.
- And you seem smitten.

705
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,647
- Look at her with the babies.
- All right.

706
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,732
Don't gas him up,
'cause he's probably gonna fuck it up.

707
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,275
Ah, maybe I won't.
You don't know that.

708
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,361
I'm pretty sure about that.

709
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:20,197
You guys are so pretty.
Tell me your names again.

710
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,615
- Sandrine.
- Sofia.

711
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:24,368
Well, I'm Mae. Great to meet you.

712
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:25,869
I thought your name was Tessa.

713
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:28,914
You did? Uh, who's Tessa?

714
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:32,042
Uncle Michael's girlfriend.
She lives in New Orleans.

715
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:35,963
It's not his girlfriend anymore, Sofia.

716
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:39,299
I forgot.
I thought they were gonna get married.

717
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:41,593
What makes you say that?

718
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:43,929
Because that's what
Uncle Michael said.

719
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,014
You do look like her though.

720
00:46:46,598 --> 00:46:47,683
So he has a type?

721
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:49,351
What does that mean?

722
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:52,688
Uh, when's the last time you saw Tessa?

723
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:58,944
Sandrine, go read to your sister
until she falls asleep.

724
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:00,028
Okay.

725
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:01,405
But I can read, too.

726
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,782
Okay, well, y'all can read to each other.

727
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:04,908
Thank you.

728
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:07,703
I don't want to hear anything up there
except reading.

729
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:09,496
Okay.

730
00:47:10,372 --> 00:47:13,125
That deep sigh, little girl.

731
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:20,924
So, we're at the reception,
and everybody is looking for Michael.

732
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:23,343
Like, where is he?
He's supposed to do the toast, and...

733
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,306
So, who... Did he do the speech?

734
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:28,599
- No!
- No, he didn't do the speech.

735
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:31,226
Our cousin Larry did it,
and he stutters a lot.

736
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,937
He was real nervous 'cause he didn't know
he was gonna be talking anyways,

737
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:36,064
- so now he extra stuttering.
- I got stage fright.

738
00:47:36,148 --> 00:47:37,566
There's so many good things
to say about you.

739
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,776
- Then you put Larry up there?
- I didn't know, you know...

740
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,738
- We had to edit it out the wedding video.
- Wasn't even that hard to find.

741
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:45,490
- It was terrible.
- I had a top hat on, like...

742
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,744
- A top hat?
- Oh, gosh, the top hat.

743
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:50,704
- A top hat.
- What was the theme of the...

744
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:52,789
- It wasn't no theme.
- There was no theme, Mae.

745
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:54,958
- There was no theme.
- He wore a top hat.

746
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,752
- Like, the wedding photos look crazy.
- Oh, God.

747
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:59,296
Everybody else got a regular fade,
but he got on a <i>Monopoly</i> hat.

748
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:02,758
- And I was trying to be nice.
- I just thought it was cool.

749
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:05,219
- It looked cool.
- No, it didn't look cool.

750
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,345
The kids kept asking you
to take a rabbit out of it.

751
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:09,806
You know what I mean?
It made you look stupid.

752
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,308
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

753
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:13,894
People started playing...
<i>Hi-de, hi-de, hi-de, ho</i>

754
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,980
That's what he looked like
he was supposed to be singing.

755
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,525
Oh, gosh. Oh, goodness.

756
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,986
I can laugh now, but it was...

757
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,322
- It was not very funny on the day of.
- She was really upset.

758
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:27,407
I mean, I laughed at the day,
'cause I know you,

759
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,034
and this is how... It's our dynamic.

760
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:31,203
Yeah, he does stuff like that.

761
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:33,664
He's very smart, but he do dumb stuff.

762
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:36,333
So, how about you tell me
what you do to keep, you know,

763
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,168
- whatever you got going on, going.
- I mean, listen.

764
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:39,419
We talk about other people.

765
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:41,255
- That makes us happy, actually.
- Clearly.

766
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:43,841
- We go people watching. That's what we do.
- He keeps me laughing.

767
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:48,637
And really, if it weren't for streaming,
divorce would be right around the corner.

768
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,182
Wait, you would leave me
if we couldn't stream movies?

769
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:55,310
Baby, I'm joking. I'm joking.
I'm joking, I'm joking.

770
00:48:55,394 --> 00:48:56,687
All right, I was, like, damn.

771
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:59,231
I'm an interesting guy,
you know what I mean?

772
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:00,315
Baby, you are interesting.

773
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:01,900
- That's right.
- I was only joking. I didn't mean that.

774
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,403
- You know, don't worry.
- Wow.

775
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:06,697
Y'all came in that storm?

776
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,657
That storm is crazy.

777
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,118
Look, what did y'all do
when the power went out today?

778
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:14,288
Um...

779
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:18,625
- Uh...
- Oh.

780
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:20,335
- Okay, well, next topic.
- Okay.

781
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:22,004
What is
all those sounds about?

782
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:23,463
Yeah, I mean, you know...

783
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:26,550
You know, she did
the little sip-and-smile thing, like...

784
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,718
Leave her alone.

785
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:30,262
But we're all grown.
Look, if y'all did it, y'all did it.

786
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:31,430
- It ain't a big thing.
- Stop.

787
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,931
People do it all the time.

788
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:34,892
- Mae... Ooh!
- This is the best do-it weather.

789
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:37,686
- Mommy?
- Yes?

790
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:39,980
Can we sleep in your bed?

791
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:41,773
Daddy?

792
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:45,694
Yeah, we'll be up there in a second
to tuck y'all in.

793
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:48,280
Stop listening
to the grown-up conversations.

794
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:52,534
- Do not turn that TV on.
- Do not turn the TV on.

795
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,413
That's also marriage...
I just repeat what she says.

796
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:58,373
I don't even know what to say
half the time.

797
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:00,167
- All right, we're going.
- Know what I mean?

798
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,460
- Good night, guys.
- Bye. Good night.

799
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:02,794
- If you need anything...
- Good night.

800
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:04,421
- Good night.
- No, I don't want y'all...

801
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:05,506
- Don't be angry.
- Come on, sir.

802
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:07,257
- I'm just saying, they already did...
- Let's go.

803
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:09,092
- Good night.
- Don't be doing that in here, okay?

804
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,886
- Sandrine!
- There's children here, okay?

805
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:11,970
- All right.
- All right.

806
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:13,931
- See y'all tomorrow, okay?
- See you in the morning.

807
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,249
It's open.

808
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:29,965
Smell good in here. What you cooking?

809
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:31,258
Red beans and rice.

810
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,391
Put that down.

811
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:43,270
You are always taking pictures of me.
I want to have one of you.

812
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:00,704
Don't you want more than this?

813
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:02,456
What you mean?

814
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:05,751
More... than what we have.

815
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:11,882
No. I want you.

816
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:17,554
- I want to be married to you.
- I'm not ready to get married.

817
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:20,307
What more do you want?

818
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:26,688
I want people to know who I am,
admire my photographs.

819
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:30,526
I love you, but my greatest accomplishment
each day cannot be cooking your dinner.

820
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,238
I have never understood
how to make you happy.

821
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:36,823
What if we moved?

822
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:39,117
- Where?
- New York.

823
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:42,663
I can't see myself there.

824
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:44,957
I can't stay here anymore.

825
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:49,878
And where does that leave us?

826
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:38,612
Hey.

827
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:40,155
Hey.

828
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:43,992
- I think it stopped raining.
- Yeah?

829
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:49,540
You want to go outside?

830
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,626
Do you want to go outside?

831
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:55,420
Yeah.

832
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,263
- We survived.
- Yeah.

833
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,766
Now we got the whole street
to ourselves, too.

834
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,646
Who's Tessa?

835
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:17,568
Your nieces had a lot to say.

836
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:20,654
Yes, she's a girl that I used to date.

837
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:22,614
When?

838
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:24,241
Uh, a few months ago.

839
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:25,367
A few months ago?

840
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:27,494
Uh, few... few weeks ago, actually.

841
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:28,579
Which is it?

842
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:29,955
See, now I sound like I'm lying.

843
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:31,874
- Are you?
- No.

844
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:33,625
So...

845
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:37,045
So, I... We broke up before I met you.

846
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:39,882
She lives in a different city, so...

847
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:42,176
Why didn't you tell me?

848
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:45,220
Because we're not together.

849
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:48,390
And because I'm here with you right now.

850
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:53,312
So, what about you?

851
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:55,397
What about me?

852
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,899
Who are you talking to?

853
00:55:57,733 --> 00:55:59,151
Nobody, really.

854
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,945
"Nobody, really." What does that mean?

855
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:05,616
Nobody anymore.

856
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:08,160
Hmm.

857
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:12,915
Listen, I, um...

858
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:18,587
Maybe this doesn't matter, but...

859
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:20,714
What? What is it?

860
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:25,844
I applied for a job... in London.

861
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:28,263
Oh.

862
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:30,140
And, you know...

863
00:56:30,224 --> 00:56:32,893
It may not mean anything
because we just met.

864
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:34,645
Right.

865
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:36,146
But I think it matters.

866
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:42,361
Why London?

867
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,533
Well, I felt like I needed a change.

868
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:52,913
And you want a change right now?

869
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,873
Well, not tonight, but...

870
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:02,589
See, my brother got me scared to say
anything of consequence to you, but...

871
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,303
I want to continue getting to know you.

872
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,225
I want to get to know you, too.

873
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:18,730
- Mommy. Come on!
- Sandrine!

874
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:20,315
- All right, Kyle.
- Okay.

875
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:22,150
- Guys.
- What do you want to eat?

876
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:24,570
I love you. I'm gonna bring it back
in two pieces for you, bro.

877
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:27,573
What do you mean, "two pieces"?
Don't play with me like that, all right?

878
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:29,491
Put some gas in there if you get a ch...

879
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:31,618
Wait, what? You want what?

880
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:33,161
Pancakes!

881
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:34,413
Why are y'all yelling at me?

882
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:36,081
- You in the kitchen with your mama.
- Pancake!

883
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:50,971
<i>When we met</i>

884
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:54,433
<i>Always knew</i>

885
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:55,767
<i>I would feel...</i>

886
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:57,519
I've been in New York for three months.

887
00:57:59,688 --> 00:58:03,150
<i>On my mind constantly...</i>

888
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:07,988
Why would I hire some girl
who just got off the bus as my assistant?

889
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:09,740
Because I'm talented.

890
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,241
Did I say that?

891
00:58:11,742 --> 00:58:13,619
No. Uh, no, sir.

892
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:16,788
<i>Here by me, baby</i>

893
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:21,919
<i>You let my love fly freely</i>

894
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:25,881
<i>I want you in my life...</i>

895
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:28,342
Because I'll work harder
than any of those silver-spoon,

896
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:30,636
Upper East Side debutantes
waiting in line outside...

897
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:35,349
whose daddies got them this interview

898
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:38,101
and will quit
as soon as they husband arrives.

899
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:44,900
<i>Nothing else can compare...</i>

900
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:47,277
Hmm.

901
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:51,281
Pack it up.

902
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:55,661
<i>I'm...</i>

903
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:59,998
<i>Caught up in the rapture of love</i>

904
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,878
<i>I'm...</i>

905
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,767
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Denise.

906
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:19,935
Christina?

907
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:22,688
Why haven't you called?

908
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:24,439
I just got a phone at home.

909
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:26,900
- <i>I wish you was here.</i>
- Christina, you have to come home.

910
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:30,362
I know. He must be furious at me.

911
00:59:30,821 --> 00:59:32,155
But I needed some time.

912
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:35,075
I'm gonna talk to him,
and he'll understand.

913
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:37,703
<i>Hell, he might even move here with me.</i>

914
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:40,706
<i>How is he?</i>

915
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:45,836
Your mother.

916
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:47,963
What about my mama?

917
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:51,425
Denise?

918
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:53,427
Is she okay?

919
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,598
She died.

920
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:16,450
I think she asked me to leave
because she knew she was sick.

921
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,869
She didn't want me to see her weak.

922
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:24,708
I'm sorry, Christina.

923
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,306
I thought he'd be here.

924
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:42,809
He's angrier than I thought.

925
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:46,980
I'm gonna go see him.

926
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:55,489
There's something you should know.

927
01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:58,659
What?

928
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:00,953
He got married.

929
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,209
Married to who?

930
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:09,461
Ashley Prentiss.

931
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:10,629
That's not funny.

932
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,217
That's impossible.

933
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:17,928
I've been gone three months.

934
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:20,305
You should've said something
before you left.

935
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:22,391
After the second month,

936
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:24,643
he was hung up on the idea
that you weren't coming back.

937
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:14,568
Let's do one more of those.

938
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,156
All right.

939
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:22,910
Good job. Move this way.

940
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:25,746
Yeah, let me get you right here.

941
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:28,999
Look off out into the window for me.

942
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:32,294
Yeah, right there.

943
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:21,969
Come here, Mae.

944
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:17,274
Peter said you were here.

945
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:20,277
I sold Violet's house.

946
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:24,323
It only took you four years to come back.

947
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:28,869
Hi, Isaac.

948
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:35,584
How's New York?

949
01:04:36,293 --> 01:04:37,503
I like it.

950
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:43,133
Who's this?

951
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:47,679
My name's Mae.

952
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:49,515
You look exactly like your mother.

953
01:04:52,017 --> 01:04:53,143
She's beautiful.

954
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:55,687
Thank you.

955
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:58,774
Heard you got married.

956
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,068
Congratulations.

957
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:06,323
Thank you.

958
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:19,419
Why...

959
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:22,673
What?

960
01:05:26,552 --> 01:05:28,303
Why don't you come over for dinner?

961
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:30,806
Ashley would be more than happy to cook.

962
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:33,183
No. That's kind.

963
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:34,268
No, really.

964
01:05:34,351 --> 01:05:36,687
No, we have a bus to catch.

965
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:45,404
Can I drive you to the station?

966
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:48,740
I didn't get a chance
to take you last time.

967
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,373
Okay.

968
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:46,673
Please don't get out.

969
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:46,335
Can I help you?

970
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,883
Hi. I'm Mae Morton.

971
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,685
I'm Christina Eames' daughter.

972
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:12,611
Is she here?

973
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:14,863
She passed away.

974
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:28,502
I'm sorry to hear that.

975
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:38,636
When?

976
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:40,596
About a month ago.

977
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:47,520
She, um...

978
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:51,191
left this for you.

979
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:53,861
She asked me to give it to you.

980
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:07,082
Do you know what it says?

981
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:09,835
No, I didn't read it.

982
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,424
I wasn't sure she'd remember me.

983
01:10:16,216 --> 01:10:17,217
She did.

984
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:25,017
She left me a letter, too.

985
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,311
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

986
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:37,196
It said I was your daughter.

987
01:10:59,343 --> 01:11:01,053
I was too afraid to ask.

988
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:03,222
Ask what?

989
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:06,308
When she brought you home,
I wanted to ask if you were mine.

990
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:12,981
Why didn't you?

991
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,026
I was married.

992
01:11:17,194 --> 01:11:18,654
She had a life in New York.

993
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:24,701
I don't know, I had to believe
if you were my daughter...

994
01:11:27,329 --> 01:11:29,081
she would've told me.

995
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:32,751
She thought it would be easier for you...

996
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:35,921
not knowing.

997
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:45,973
It would've been easier
if I just would've asked.

998
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:04,199
Can you stay for some boiled crab?

999
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:08,120
Yeah.

1000
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:12,499
Hey.

1001
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,543
I need to talk to you.

1002
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:18,005
You're making me nervous.

1003
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:20,048
When are you ever nervous?

1004
01:12:20,465 --> 01:12:22,301
When someone's like,
"I need to talk to you."

1005
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:28,307
What is it?

1006
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:30,642
I just found out I got the job.

1007
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:32,311
Oh, I can't believe you.

1008
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:36,690
I think the words you're looking for are,
"Congratulations. Good job."

1009
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:38,442
Congratulations.

1010
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:39,818
There you are. Thank you.

1011
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:41,695
I hope it doesn't work out.

1012
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:44,656
When do you start?

1013
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:45,866
Uh, a couple weeks.

1014
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:48,869
You still owe me a story... before you go.

1015
01:12:48,952 --> 01:12:50,162
Yeah.

1016
01:12:52,164 --> 01:12:54,333
You sure you don't want me
to find you something else?

1017
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:55,751
You know what you could do?

1018
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:56,877
Hmm?

1019
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,337
You could promote Andy.

1020
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:01,006
- Right?
- I'm not... I won't do that.

1021
01:13:01,798 --> 01:13:03,926
Maybe. Maybe.

1022
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:05,427
- Yeah.
- Unlikely.

1023
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,140
<i>Maybe I moved on because I was scared</i>

1024
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:12,351
<i>I couldn't make Christina happy.</i>

1025
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:13,644
<i>What happened?</i>

1026
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:18,023
<i>I was afraid of failing her,
that she'd resent me eventually.</i>

1027
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:41,213
Okay, look, man,
you sure you want to do this?

1028
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:43,298
Yes. Yes.

1029
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:45,008
- Yeah.
- London, Michael? Huh?

1030
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:47,553
Like, for real,
you want to move to London?

1031
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:49,972
You understand there's a five-hour
time difference, right?

1032
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:52,266
Of course I know that. Yes, I know that.

1033
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:55,018
If you know that,
then have some respect for me, okay?

1034
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:56,895
Want me to change my schedule
around for you?

1035
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:59,106
Waking up in the middle of the night,
answering your phone calls?

1036
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:00,232
I don't want to be doing all that.

1037
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:01,650
What's this look I'm see...

1038
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:04,194
Is this... Oh, you're gonna miss me, huh?

1039
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:06,029
- Nope.
- You're gonna miss me.

1040
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:08,532
I ain't gonna miss... No, I'm not.
I'm not gonna miss you.

1041
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:11,243
Stop playing with me.
Okay, yes. Maybe a little bit.

1042
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:12,536
- Oh, there it is, see.
- All right?

1043
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:17,291
Man, I don't know, I just...
I have to do this.

1044
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,501
I need this.

1045
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,920
You're not gonna talk to this girl
before you leave?

1046
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:23,547
- I don't know.
- I think you should do that.

1047
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:25,841
I mean, she called,
but I didn't call her back.

1048
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:27,926
Wait, you ain't called her back?

1049
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:30,387
That's not like Michael.

1050
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:32,806
I just didn't know what to say.

1051
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,809
And that's your plan, right?
Just gonna act funny?

1052
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:37,769
- Why you doing this?
- What...

1053
01:14:38,395 --> 01:14:41,064
You're the one who told me
not to get involved, remember?

1054
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:42,649
You said...
"Don't get involved."

1055
01:14:42,733 --> 01:14:45,611
Okay, I didn't... First of all,
I don't sound like a mad scientist.

1056
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:47,029
That's not how I talk.

1057
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:48,447
And look, I know what I said.

1058
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:50,282
I said don't get involved too quickly.

1059
01:14:50,365 --> 01:14:52,576
- All right. Okay. Semantics.
- 'Cause that's what you usually do.

1060
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:55,746
You always move into stuff fast.
I was just being honest with you.

1061
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:57,289
Okay. Yeah.

1062
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:00,292
- Text her or something.
- Whatever. All right.

1063
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,377
DM her on Instagram. I don't know.

1064
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:07,674
I mean, look, you're a grown man,
and you got to do what's best for you.

1065
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:08,759
Yeah.

1066
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:12,888
When do you leave?

1067
01:15:12,971 --> 01:15:15,599
Uh, I'll go back to Louisiana
a couple days, finish up work.

1068
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:17,893
Then I'm packing.

1069
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:25,943
And don't make this all dramatic.
Come on, give me some toast, huh?

1070
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:31,365
Come on, meet me over here. Get over here.

1071
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:32,449
Boom. There we go.

1072
01:15:34,117 --> 01:15:36,745
<i>Please don't push me, I'm on the edge</i>

1073
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:40,999
<i>I don't care too much,
but you want it, baby</i>

1074
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:46,046
<i>Let's go through it together</i>

1075
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:49,007
<i>Maybe it's for the better</i>

1076
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:50,551
<i>'Cause you'll let me be</i>

1077
01:15:50,634 --> 01:15:52,886
<i>Oh, babe, I let you go there</i>

1078
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,596
<i>To roll up and then go back</i>

1079
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,765
<i>Meet me at the corner, baby,
you know where</i>

1080
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:59,476
<i>Is it cruel of me</i>

1081
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,520
<i>To pretend I can't see...</i>

1082
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:07,150
- Hey.
- Hey.

1083
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:08,819
What you doing here?

1084
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:10,571
Another interview.

1085
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:12,322
You almost done?

1086
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:13,949
Almost.

1087
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:24,960
I wasn't expecting that at all.

1088
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:30,257
I tried to call you to tell you.
You didn't call me back.

1089
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:31,675
Right.

1090
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:34,845
"Hi, Mae. Hello. It's Michael.
I'm calling you back."

1091
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:36,847
I could've said that.

1092
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:39,474
"Things were awkward
the morning after the storm,

1093
01:16:39,558 --> 01:16:41,310
"but that doesn't change
what happened between us."

1094
01:16:41,393 --> 01:16:43,478
Oh, you're good. No, I like that one.

1095
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:44,563
Thank you.

1096
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:52,946
Getting to know each other was good.

1097
01:16:53,447 --> 01:16:57,951
Yeah, well,
I liked getting to know each other.

1098
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:00,162
Yeah.

1099
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:02,998
So, what, you just leaving New York

1100
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:06,293
and trading in the Kerry James Marshall
for the Bywater?

1101
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:08,003
Do you see me living here?

1102
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:10,714
Ah, I don't know. I like this casual you.

1103
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:12,549
So, you're saying I'm uptight in New York?

1104
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:16,220
Nah, I mean, you just seem relaxed.

1105
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:25,646
I'm going to Christina's house
at Pointe à la Hache later.

1106
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:28,649
Mmm.

1107
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,568
Do you want to come with me?

1108
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:34,238
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to come.

1109
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:37,449
What you trying to listen to?

1110
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:39,826
Drake.

1111
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:44,248
I... I cannot stand Drake.

1112
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:48,126
You know I don't want to hear no Drake.
All right, put some Kendrick on.

1113
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:50,963
Not in my car. Come on.

1114
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:54,007
I'm not putting on Kendrick.
That is a fact.

1115
01:17:54,091 --> 01:17:55,175
Depressing car ride.

1116
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:57,302
We're gonna get pulled over by the police
listening to Kendrick.

1117
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,055
It's...

1118
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:04,226
Did you say your ex-girlfriend
lived in New Orleans?

1119
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:07,437
I never said that.

1120
01:18:08,105 --> 01:18:10,148
- You didn't?
- No.

1121
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:16,655
Okay, you know what, you're right.
It wasn't you. It was... Sandrine.

1122
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:18,407
- Oh, my God.
- Or Sofia. Was it...

1123
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:20,576
Sandrine and Sofia again.

1124
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:22,536
Could you just tell me
everything they said?

1125
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:26,039
- You just tell me now, word for word.
- Why would I violate the sister code?

1126
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:28,750
- Wow.
- No. Just answer my question.

1127
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:30,836
Did you... Did you happen to see her
while you were here?

1128
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:32,796
- See who?
- Your ex-girl.

1129
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,881
No.

1130
01:18:33,964 --> 01:18:35,883
I have not seen her.

1131
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:38,719
Okay, you don't have to get all defensive.

1132
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:40,679
- I'm not defensive.
- I'm just asking a question.

1133
01:18:40,762 --> 01:18:43,515
I feel good. Do I look defensive to you?
Defenses are down.

1134
01:19:35,692 --> 01:19:37,069
I guess no one's home.

1135
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:43,200
Uh, didn't you say, uh,
Christina had a darkroom?

1136
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:48,247
Yeah, in the back,
but I doubt it's there now.

1137
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:50,958
You want to check?

1138
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:21,775
Two champagnes, please.

1139
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:23,360
Two? Okay, coming right up.

1140
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:29,825
- For you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1141
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:29,801
We should move here.

1142
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,888
Or at least come back.

1143
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:40,020
When are you going back to New York?
'Cause I have a show next Tuesday.

1144
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,525
I've been meaning to tell you...

1145
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:46,818
What?

1146
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:49,780
I'm moving to London.

1147
01:23:50,364 --> 01:23:51,573
- What?
- Yeah, I...

1148
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:53,700
I got the job.

1149
01:23:54,326 --> 01:23:55,369
When?

1150
01:23:57,704 --> 01:23:58,789
Could we just...

1151
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:05,712
I just... I just found out.

1152
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:09,424
Well, we were together all day.
Why didn't you say something?

1153
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:12,261
I know. I just...
We were having a good time.

1154
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:14,638
You know, I didn't want
to, uh, mess it up.

1155
01:24:16,473 --> 01:24:18,016
So, what do we do now?

1156
01:24:19,935 --> 01:24:22,145
I don't know. Figure it out.

1157
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:23,897
- How?
- Well, I can go to...

1158
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:26,483
I can come to New York,
and you can come to London,

1159
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:29,152
and we could go back and forth
and we figure it out.

1160
01:24:29,695 --> 01:24:30,696
It's not practical.

1161
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:32,781
I know. I'm not trying
to be practical right now.

1162
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:34,867
I want to be with you.

1163
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:37,953
Long distance never works.

1164
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:40,998
- What?
- It never works.

1165
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:44,293
Well, be optimistic. Come on.

1166
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:47,254
I don't want to get together
just to break up.

1167
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:49,173
- I'm being honest.
- Honest?

1168
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:52,384
Yeah. I forgot,
you have trouble being honest.

1169
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:54,344
Okay, uh, so what...
What is that supposed to mean?

1170
01:24:54,428 --> 01:24:57,472
Aren't you always searching
for something honest to say to a woman?

1171
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:01,727
That's what I'm doing right now.
All right?

1172
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:05,564
I'm being honest, and I'm saying
I want to try to be together.

1173
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:12,362
Maybe we should just enjoy being here.

1174
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,651
Michael still in town?

1175
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:52,444
No, he left last night.

1176
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:55,113
Why you didn't leave with him?

1177
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:57,407
'Cause I wanted to stay longer.

1178
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,786
I feel like that's not the whole story.

1179
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:03,247
It's most of it.

1180
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:05,666
I guess you more than look
like your mother.

1181
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:11,713
Yeah, I'm... probably more like her
than I'd like to be.

1182
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:14,424
That's not a bad thing.

1183
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:17,511
She was unwavering
in everything she wanted.

1184
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,223
How could you say that, after everything?

1185
01:26:24,601 --> 01:26:26,144
I don't blame her for leaving.

1186
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:29,439
What did she say?

1187
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:32,359
What did the letter say?

1188
01:26:34,027 --> 01:26:35,362
She apologized.

1189
01:26:38,949 --> 01:26:42,619
She kept you from me for so long,
she didn't know how to go back...

1190
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:45,664
how to tell me.

1191
01:26:51,879 --> 01:26:54,047
She asked me to take care of you.

1192
01:26:56,466 --> 01:26:58,093
I keep rereading mine.

1193
01:27:00,429 --> 01:27:04,308
She wrote over and over again, "My Mae."

1194
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:11,899
I keep reading those two words...

1195
01:27:14,276 --> 01:27:16,570
like they're evidence that she loved me.

1196
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:21,617
She did.

1197
01:27:23,035 --> 01:27:24,328
Very much.

1198
01:27:49,478 --> 01:27:51,230
<i>"y Mae,</i>

1199
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:54,816
<i>I didn't know how to love you except
by showing you the arc of a woman,</i>

1200
01:27:55,651 --> 01:27:57,486
<i>by being a good provider.</i>

1201
01:28:05,786 --> 01:28:09,498
<i>I put my love into work, my photographs.</i>

1202
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:12,960
<i>Pictures took space in my heart
instead of people.</i>

1203
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:15,754
<i>It was the only way I could love.</i>

1204
01:28:16,463 --> 01:28:19,842
<i>I was stumbling through my own life,
trying not to break apart.</i>

1205
01:28:20,676 --> 01:28:24,012
<i>I wish I had put as much courage
into being your mother</i>

1206
01:28:24,096 --> 01:28:26,098
<i>as I was able to put in my work.</i>

1207
01:29:40,672 --> 01:29:41,965
Evening, Mr. Morton.

1208
01:29:44,301 --> 01:29:47,012
I told her to tell you about Isaac.

1209
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:49,264
What did she say?

1210
01:29:49,348 --> 01:29:51,266
She made me promise never to tell you.

1211
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:56,230
She thought it would just confuse you
and make his life harder, so I agreed.

1212
01:29:56,647 --> 01:30:01,026
Maybe I was wrong for that.
And if I am, I'm sorry.

1213
01:30:03,487 --> 01:30:06,281
When I first met her,
she was three months pregnant.

1214
01:30:06,698 --> 01:30:08,909
- And that didn't bother you?
- No.

1215
01:30:09,868 --> 01:30:11,453
I couldn't look away from her.

1216
01:30:12,663 --> 01:30:13,789
But she...

1217
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:16,416
She turned me down at first.

1218
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,211
- Why?
- She thought I felt sorry for her.

1219
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:22,381
And she told me she didn't feel
the need to be an "honest woman."

1220
01:30:22,464 --> 01:30:25,759
But I know
she was just hung up on him.

1221
01:30:26,218 --> 01:30:28,053
So, why would she tell me now?

1222
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:30,806
Maybe it was her way of explaining...

1223
01:30:32,057 --> 01:30:33,350
Explaining what?

1224
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,018
Why she was the way she was.

1225
01:30:36,228 --> 01:30:39,022
And why she was never very good at...

1226
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:41,817
being your mother.

1227
01:30:45,946 --> 01:30:49,700
Do you remember when you were leaving
for Chicago, for school?

1228
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:56,999
Yeah. Mom didn't come to the airport
'cause she said she had to meet somebody.

1229
01:30:57,833 --> 01:31:02,087
Like I wasn't moving across the country.
Like I wasn't more important.

1230
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:03,922
She didn't have to meet anyone.

1231
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:09,094
When I came home, she was sitting
in the back of the house, crying.

1232
01:31:11,597 --> 01:31:14,099
Your mother wasn't very good at goodbyes.

1233
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:22,274
I'm not a sentimental person,
as many of you know.

1234
01:31:22,357 --> 01:31:25,360
I don't like getting attached to people.
It makes it harder to fire them.

1235
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:29,573
And it makes it that much more
annoying when they abandon you.

1236
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:31,658
I'm not abandoning you.

1237
01:31:31,742 --> 01:31:33,619
He's leaving,
and he thinks he's better than us.

1238
01:31:35,412 --> 01:31:37,372
Well, let's all pretend to wish him luck.

1239
01:31:37,956 --> 01:31:39,666
- Good luck, Michael.
- Good luck, Michael.

1240
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:40,751
Thank you.

1241
01:31:50,469 --> 01:31:52,930
We got more negatives
from Billy Wasko's archives

1242
01:31:53,013 --> 01:31:54,515
for Christina's retrospective.

1243
01:31:54,848 --> 01:31:55,974
Thanks.

1244
01:31:57,643 --> 01:31:58,644
Are you heading out?

1245
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:01,021
Yeah. Dinner with Andy.

1246
01:32:03,857 --> 01:32:05,692
I'm uncomfortable with how happy you are.

1247
01:32:05,776 --> 01:32:07,152
How do you think I feel?

1248
01:32:07,236 --> 01:32:11,406
Being unhappy and jaded,
it's comfortable, but...

1249
01:32:12,366 --> 01:32:13,408
But?

1250
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:19,873
I like him, and,
maybe I'm not who I thought I was.

1251
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:21,708
Maybe I'm different with him.

1252
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,545
So, you're choosing to be
a different person?

1253
01:32:26,088 --> 01:32:29,007
I don't know.
I'm just choosing to be with him.

1254
01:32:32,845 --> 01:32:34,221
What about you?

1255
01:32:35,222 --> 01:32:36,557
I think I messed that up.

1256
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:42,604
It's like I said the opposite
of everything that I wanted to say to him.

1257
01:32:44,731 --> 01:32:46,358
Well, what did you want to say?

1258
01:32:48,193 --> 01:32:49,862
That I wanted him to stay.

1259
01:32:53,574 --> 01:32:54,908
Can you still tell him that?

1260
01:32:56,785 --> 01:32:57,995
I don't know. I...

1261
01:32:59,872 --> 01:33:01,665
He looked at me
like he was so disappointed.

1262
01:33:02,749 --> 01:33:06,920
I don't know, I felt like I couldn't
ask him to rearrange his life for me.

1263
01:33:09,381 --> 01:33:11,758
It's too late. It's... Whatever.

1264
01:33:14,386 --> 01:33:16,138
Have you selected the final photos?

1265
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:17,681
Uh, almost.

1266
01:33:18,849 --> 01:33:21,185
I'm just gonna go through
the rest of her archives

1267
01:33:21,268 --> 01:33:23,729
and see if there's anything else
I want to show.

1268
01:33:24,354 --> 01:33:25,355
Okay.

1269
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:26,440
Bye.

1270
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:53,258
- Yo.
- Yo.

1271
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:54,968
What's up?

1272
01:33:55,928 --> 01:33:57,971
So, uh, did Sara tell you?

1273
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:59,431
What?

1274
01:34:00,307 --> 01:34:03,393
I'm not an intern anymore.
I'm a paid employee.

1275
01:34:03,977 --> 01:34:05,187
- Boom.
- Boom.

1276
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,439
Oh, congratulations. Wow.

1277
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:09,107
Did you tell her to promote me?

1278
01:34:09,191 --> 01:34:10,400
- No.
- Hmm.

1279
01:34:10,484 --> 01:34:12,319
Thank you.

1280
01:34:12,402 --> 01:34:13,487
Whatever, man.

1281
01:34:16,365 --> 01:34:18,534
Um, I'm gonna miss you, man.

1282
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:20,702
Oh, man, don't miss me.

1283
01:34:23,288 --> 01:34:24,706
Oh, all right.

1284
01:34:26,124 --> 01:34:28,043
All right.

1285
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:33,298
I read your, um, article
on Pointe à la Hache.

1286
01:34:33,924 --> 01:34:36,134
- What'd you think?
- It was personal.

1287
01:34:36,218 --> 01:34:37,261
I know.

1288
01:34:37,886 --> 01:34:42,683
Probably too personal.
It became all about me and my stuff.

1289
01:34:43,767 --> 01:34:45,519
It's not often you meet someone like that.

1290
01:34:45,602 --> 01:34:48,564
Yeah, I know. Christina and Isaac, man,
that's an anomaly.

1291
01:34:48,647 --> 01:34:50,107
I'm talking about Mae.

1292
01:34:54,987 --> 01:34:57,197
The office is gonna be bleak
without you, man.

1293
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:26,560
<i>Do you miss Louisiana?</i>

1294
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:29,521
<i>Parts of it.</i>

1295
01:35:29,605 --> 01:35:33,150
- <i>Hmm. What parts?</i>
- <i>The good parts.</i>

1296
01:35:35,027 --> 01:35:37,154
<i>And what do you like
about New York?</i>

1297
01:35:37,988 --> 01:35:39,448
<i>I like my work.</i>

1298
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:44,661
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

1299
01:35:46,288 --> 01:35:51,251
<i>That I wish I was as good at love
as I am at working.</i>

1300
01:36:09,394 --> 01:36:11,980
<i>I wish I didn't leave people behind
so often.</i>

1301
01:36:57,901 --> 01:36:59,820
Mr. Williams.

1302
01:37:05,117 --> 01:37:06,285
Michael Block?

1303
01:37:06,952 --> 01:37:08,036
Yeah.

1304
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:54,625
Sorry, bro.

1305
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:58,086
Want tickets
to Kendrick Lamar, anyone?

1306
01:38:14,728 --> 01:38:17,231
- Hey.
- Hey.

1307
01:38:19,191 --> 01:38:21,485
I just really felt like seeing Kendrick.

1308
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:24,905
No, you didn't.

1309
01:38:25,572 --> 01:38:28,408
I guess I'm lucky that, you know,
he was performing here tonight.

1310
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:32,329
And I really wanted to see you.

1311
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:35,165
I've been wanting to see you, too.

1312
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:41,421
I'm sorry for not knowing
what to say before you left.

1313
01:38:41,505 --> 01:38:44,508
I just didn't know
how to tell you how I felt.

1314
01:38:45,717 --> 01:38:50,180
And I think I'm not used
to needing anyone.

1315
01:38:50,931 --> 01:38:52,266
Yeah. I get that.

1316
01:38:53,934 --> 01:38:55,269
But I need you.

1317
01:38:56,395 --> 01:38:58,480
And I don't care where you live.

1318
01:38:58,564 --> 01:39:01,567
I just want to be close to you
as much as possible.

1319
01:39:02,025 --> 01:39:05,654
I don't want to be practical.
I want to figure it out.

1320
01:39:07,489 --> 01:39:10,784
And I don't want so much time to pass
that we can't come back.

1321
01:39:10,868 --> 01:39:12,953
- Yeah.
- And I... I don't want...

1322
01:39:25,257 --> 01:39:27,176
You know, we will always come back.

1323
01:39:29,052 --> 01:39:30,262
Really?

1324
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:33,265
You know that.

1325
01:39:37,603 --> 01:39:39,021
How's London?

1326
01:39:39,563 --> 01:39:41,565
Uh, I've just been out here
being pathetic,

1327
01:39:41,648 --> 01:39:43,025
thinking about you.

1328
01:39:43,108 --> 01:39:44,526
That's good.

1329
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:02,252
You want to go hear some music?

1330
01:40:03,045 --> 01:40:04,254
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1331
01:40:11,053 --> 01:40:12,804
We have a show to see!
