2
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:10,968
West Berlin, 1945

3
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:19,988
Passport.

4
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,988
Nice car!

5
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:39,195
Where did you get it from?

6
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:40,675
It's a Wagen from Switzerland.

7
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:42,978
It's like you?

8
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:44,055
like me.

9
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:49,938
It's a Wagen Switzerland!
The girl too!

10
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:55,938
I wanna see your face.

11
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:58,938
Can I talk to you?

12
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:03,338
Common she's not Eva Braun.

13
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:07,078
Of course not! The bitch
got killed by her husband!

14
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:09,678
She's from the camps.

15
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:17,338
Show me your face.

16
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:17,935
Please.

17
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:19,045
Shut up!

18
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,045
Show me your face, now!

19
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:36,008
Sorry.

20
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:40,600
It's okay.

21
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,100
Let 'em pass!

22
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:27,443
The wound canal is
from a gunshot.

23
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:31,651
They thought you were dead.
You were lucky.

24
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:34,734
Can you see?

25
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:38,068
That's good.

26
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,526
The patient has wound fever.
Intravenous penicillin.

27
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:46,484
Cheekbone and nasal
bone are shattered.

28
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:49,109
Chipping to the
left cranial bone.

29
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,401
You were a singer?

30
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,734
Where was that?

31
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:00,526
Most recently at the St.Michaels choir.
In London?

32
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,693
Yes.
When?

33
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:04,901
Up to '38.

34
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:08,443
Then you, a Jewess, returned here.
Why?

35
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,526
They have wonderfully
cool cellars.

36
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:21,568
And there's a real
plantation in the park.

37
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,901
We'll soon be able
to walk around.

38
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:28,484
And you'll be able to...
Who's paying for this, Lene?

39
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,068
You?
No.

40
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,526
You inherited.

41
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,651
Your entire family is dead.

42
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:48,234
And Herbert and Marie...

43
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,776
the twins...
Esther?

44
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,234
I haven't found her yet.

45
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,068
Where is Johnny?

46
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,693
So how do you
want to look?

47
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,359
It's your choice.

48
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:27,443
Some of my patients
favor Zarah Leander,

49
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,568
others Miss Soderbaum.

50
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:32,651
I guess they're both
out of fashion now.

51
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:37,901
A few gentlemen out there would
probably like new faces, too.

52
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:40,818
I want to look like I used to.

53
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:46,151
That's difficult.
I recommend you think it over.

54
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:47,609
Why?

55
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:50,526
On the one hand,
it's never quite the same,

56
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:53,943
and on the other, a new
face is an advantage.

57
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:59,776
How is it an advantage?
You'll be a new and different person.

58
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,484
You won't be identifiable,
which means...

59
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:05,151
I want to look exactly
like I used to.

60
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:14,401
You'll receive an
intravenous anesthetic.

61
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:17,901
An ether mask can't be used
due to your face's condition,

62
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:21,151
but don't be concerned,
you'll sleep deeply.

63
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:24,318
Just count backwards: ten...

64
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,193
nine, eight, etc.

65
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:29,276
Know what the Americans call it?
A 'countdown'.

66
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:32,818
It comes from a German film,
'Woman in the Moon'.

67
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:36,776
So now count, ten...

68
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:38,526
Ten.
Nine...

69
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:40,609
Nine.
Carry on.

70
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,526
Eight, seven...

71
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:45,943
six, five...

72
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:05,359
JEW. JEW.
JEW...

73
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:21,959
Sir!

74
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:31,559
Sir! What the hell do
you think you're doing?

75
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,059
Excuse me?!

76
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,759
Oh Sorry! Lene Winter
from the agency.

77
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:56,899
What happened?

78
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,899
He's trying to shanghai
something in the cards.

79
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,989
Well, he's not the only one.
Hmm?

80
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,689
Can I have a look?

81
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,796
Go ahead.

82
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,234
Johannes Lenz, Pianist - Divorced
October 04,1944

83
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:31,776
That's already
looking really good.

84
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:46,109
A couple of days and
the bandages come off.

85
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,609
I found an apartment,
by the way.

86
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:53,943
In Haifa.

87
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,443
You can see the sea.

88
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:01,484
Beautiful, simple
lined architecture.

89
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:03,443
Bernstein designed it.

90
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:06,359
I've got photos.
Want a look?

91
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:11,193
Here.

92
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:30,776
No, I didn't see him.

93
00:12:45,193 --> 00:12:48,401
Nelly, it was bombed out.
It no longer exists.

94
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:04,776
I no longer exist.

95
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,193
Nelly, remember how you
felt three months ago?

96
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:17,776
How desperate you were?

97
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,776
It's extraordinary
what Dr.Bongartz...

98
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:30,818
In a few days the bandages come off...
Would you recognize me?

99
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,568
Would you recognize me?

100
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:36,193
Yes.

101
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:38,943
No.

102
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:45,484
This is me.

103
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:49,276
Where did you get that?

104
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:57,693
The clinic needed pictures
for the reconstruction.

105
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,943
Sorry, that's the wrong word.

106
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:06,443
Dr.Bongartz used
it and I simply...

107
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,734
Re-creation is better, right?
Re-creation.

108
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:14,193
Just look at me.

109
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:17,193
Nelly, you're beautiful.

110
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:21,901
That's not the point.

111
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:26,818
What do the circles signify?

112
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:29,276
Those are Nazis.

113
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,651
And the crosses
are for the dead?

114
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:40,484
Yes.

115
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:44,234
We need a cross
above Esther, too.

116
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:52,401
It's such a miracle
you survived.

117
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:05,526
There's no cross
above Johnny.

118
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:07,401
Johnny doesn't interest me.

119
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:20,693
Here are dresses,

120
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:24,276
a jacket of English cloth,

121
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,693
and there are two coats,
a summer one and a lined one,

122
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,151
to get you started.

123
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:31,609
It was all acquired
by Mrs. Winter.

124
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:33,568
Wonderful cloth.

125
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,568
You're a size 38, right?

126
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:40,943
And when are you
going to Palestine?

127
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:45,276
I don't know yet.

128
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:50,359
So, this is the bathroom,

129
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:52,526
all fully equipped,

130
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,151
and in perfect
working order.

131
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:58,151
If you need anything,
please let me know.

132
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:04,776
No, that we won't do.

133
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,901
The light stays off.

134
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,609
We have a real
plague of flies.

135
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,234
The war didn't seem
to bother them at all.

136
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,693
They come up from
the lake in swarms.

137
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:24,151
No, please don't,
I'd rather do it myself.

138
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:30,068
When do we dine, Elisabeth?
At seven, if it please you, Ma'am.

139
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:34,068
What have you cooked for us?
Stuffed cabbage with sweetbread.

140
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:36,234
Where did the
sweetbread come from?

141
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:39,193
I have no nutmeg, no butter,

142
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:41,401
no black pepper, it's awful.

143
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,193
But you improvise
so wonderfully.

144
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:46,526
Improvise, improvise!

145
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,443
I've had it with improvising.

146
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:56,526
Elisabeth is really a gem.

147
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:01,193
She's not a Nazi?
She always hated the Nazis.

148
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,318
So, you like it?

149
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:11,151
Yes.

150
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:13,151
Great.

151
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:18,693
By the way, I put the papers for
the Haifa apartment on the desk.

152
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:23,526
And I found two other
for us in Tel Aviv.

153
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:28,276
One is on a housing project.
We're being allocated terrain.

154
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:41,318
You know, it wasn't easy
getting us both a visa.

155
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:08,526
So, there.
Thank you, Elisabeth.

156
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:48,943
Can you manage?

157
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:50,401
Yes.

158
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,943
Can I hear that again?

159
00:20:05,526 --> 00:20:06,901
It's nice, huh?

160
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:27,526
I'd listened to it in London
before falling asleep.

161
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,484
Would you sing it for me?

162
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:43,693
Okay.

163
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:50,818
I can't stand German
songs anymore.

164
00:20:57,901 --> 00:21:00,776
When you're better, we'll
take care of your assets.

165
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:07,526
Is it a lot?

166
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,026
They're substantial.
It'll take a while...

167
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:17,026
to get the Nazis out of the properties,
but there's lots of money in Switzerland.

168
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,859
It's the victims' money,
it brings an obligation.

169
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:23,568
To do what?

170
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:32,568
To go to Palestine and found a
state where we Jews can live safely.

171
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:36,109
To do so, we take back
all they took away.

172
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:41,359
Maybe then we can sing and
hear German songs again.

173
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:56,318
Did you like it?

174
00:22:58,318 --> 00:22:59,401
Yes.

175
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:01,484
Then give me something.

176
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:04,234
Yes.

177
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:17,443
I'm looking for my husband.

178
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:21,193
He's a musician, too.

179
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,859
What does he play?

180
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,526
He's a pianist.

181
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:31,651
If he's lucky, he'll be in
one of the cabarets or clubs.

182
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:35,693
If not, he'll be on the
corner with an accordion.

183
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:41,318
What clubs?

184
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,234
I'd try the American sector.

185
00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:54,359
Johnny, what did I do?

186
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:56,818
I just wanted
to dance a bit.

187
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,109
Let go of me! Johnny!
Get off me!

188
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:20,919
Johnny!

189
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:31,193
Yes.

190
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:40,068
Excuse me.
I mistook you for someone.

191
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:42,693
Stay where you are.

192
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:46,234
I told you to
stop right there.

193
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:06,193
What do you have
in your bag?

194
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,109
Show me.

195
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,776
The fine coat!

196
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:32,276
I'll never remove that.

197
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,734
That's tar.

198
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:37,443
Where was she gallivanting?

199
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:41,443
Would you leave us for
a moment, Elisabeth?

200
00:27:48,526 --> 00:27:49,943
So, did you meet him?

201
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:57,609
You can't just wander around at night.
There are all sorts out.

202
00:27:57,818 --> 00:27:59,401
I don't go out
without a revolver.

203
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:04,401
I can't always look after you,
I have to go to Poland soon.

204
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:07,026
I might be there a while.
How long?

205
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,943
A week, two,
maybe longer.

206
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:19,109
Did you give thought
to Haifa or Tel Aviv?

207
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:24,443
In Tel Aviv there's a Jewish
choir run by Vera Stroux.

208
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:27,734
It might suit you.
What would I do in a Jewish choir?

209
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:31,109
I'm not a Jew.
You are, like it or not.

210
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:34,318
They tried to kill you
because you're a Jew.

211
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,734
We can't remain here, Nelly.

212
00:28:58,526 --> 00:29:00,109
Johnny betrayed you.

213
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:07,901
You were arrested
on October 6, 1944.

214
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:11,776
Johnny was arrested
on October 4, 1944.

215
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:16,651
He was interrogated and released
just after your arrest on October 6.

216
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:20,193
He wasn't put in prison.
No punishment. Indeed...

217
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:24,276
he was allowed to play again...
now he wants your money.

218
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:26,109
Did you see him?

219
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:29,526
Yes.
When?

220
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,234
Two months ago.

221
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,484
Did you speak to him?

222
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:42,609
I don't speak to traitors.

223
00:30:24,193 --> 00:30:25,818
Shop window mannequin.

224
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:28,859
Wonderful!
Wonderful!

225
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:31,151
We have beer.

226
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:34,068
We have cold beer.
We have whisky.

227
00:30:34,943 --> 00:30:36,609
We have champagne.

228
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,609
And now our delightful
Vicky and Lola

229
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:52,193
will sing the one and
only Cole Porter's...

230
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:54,318

Nelly?

257
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:34,526
Everything okay?

258
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:38,443
Yes.

259
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,109
One second,
I'll be right back.

260
00:33:57,734 --> 00:33:59,318
I got you a revolver, too.

261
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:03,026
Know how to use it?

262
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:08,484
Sometimes just showing
it is enough.

263
00:34:55,568 --> 00:34:56,901
I'm looking for Johnny.

264
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:02,734
Did he gave you
those black eyes?

265
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:06,068
He works here.

266
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:08,609
There's no Johnny here.

267
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:17,401
But I saw him.
I don't know a Johnny. Do you?

268
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:22,484
Johnny, you swine,
your pockets are empty

269
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:25,693
But the cellar is full,
so really there's plenty

270
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:29,484
The world is a quay
all covered with girls

271
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:33,526
The sailors go cross-eyed
when they give them a twirl

272
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:45,526
How about a coffee?
Or two?

273
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:47,818
Coming up.
Are you Johnny?

274
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:51,026
The doll here wants work.
But don't hit her again.

275
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,151
Johannes,
get a move on!

276
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,401

All of your own?

301
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:26,734
Wait, Miss.

302
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:36,901
This way, Miss.
I don't have much time.

303
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:43,526
We can earn
a lot of money.

304
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:47,109
You look very similar
to someone.

305
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:49,026
To whom?
My wife.

306
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:52,276
Alive she was poor,
dead, she's rich.

307
00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:54,151
What?
Why?

308
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,651
She and all her
family were killed.

309
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:00,818
This way.

310
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:34,401
You can have
the backroom.

311
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:39,109
I sleep here.

312
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:42,151
I can't get her inheritance.

313
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:44,484
There's no evidence
she's dead.

314
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:48,609
Maybe she's still alive.
She's dead.

315
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:52,526
You have to play my wife.

316
00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:56,901
I'll instruct you.
You'll return as a survivor,

317
00:39:57,443 --> 00:39:59,068
and collect her estate.

318
00:39:59,276 --> 00:40:00,526
We'll split it.

319
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:03,609
There's 20,000 dollars
in it for you.

320
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:09,193
But you can't go out
over the coming weeks.

321
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:11,151
Nobody may see you.

322
00:40:11,984 --> 00:40:13,526
I'll take care of food.

323
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:17,693
There's an American beer there.
Johnny!

324
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:19,526
Please don't call me that.

325
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:23,109
And...
what should I call you?

326
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:24,443
Johannes.

327
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:27,609
You'll call me
Johnny in public.

328
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:30,568
Until then it's Johannes.
Public?

329
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:32,901
Yes, when you return
as a survivor.

330
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:37,818
What's your name,
anyway?

331
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:42,859
Esther.

332
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,693
There aren't many
Esthers left.

333
00:40:50,443 --> 00:40:51,818
What was your
wife's name?

334
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:53,859
Nelly.

335
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,859
I'll be back at four.

336
00:40:57,651 --> 00:40:59,318
Please let me sleep in.

337
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:02,359
Do I...

338
00:41:02,651 --> 00:41:04,609
really look similar to her?

339
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:06,568
No.
But you will.

340
00:42:01,193 --> 00:42:02,526
Lene?

341
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:08,901
Lene!

342
00:42:16,526 --> 00:42:18,359
Nelly?
Yes.

343
00:42:22,734 --> 00:42:24,276
No, don't turn the light on.

344
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:36,859
You saw him.

345
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:40,234
Yes.

346
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:46,026
What happened?

347
00:43:23,443 --> 00:43:24,776
It's open.

348
00:43:40,984 --> 00:43:42,401
Please go back out.

349
00:43:42,943 --> 00:43:44,234
Redo your entrance.

350
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:48,318
Come back in again.

351
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:54,193
Without the bag.

352
00:44:17,943 --> 00:44:19,484
Don't look at me,

353
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:22,234
Just come in and walk
down the stairs.

354
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:25,693
Just carry on
down the stairs.

355
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:54,193
Frankly I hoped you
wouldn't come back.

356
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,693
Why?
It won't work.

357
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:01,651
Here are two dollars.

358
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:07,609
And a ration card.
I'm sorry.

359
00:45:08,193 --> 00:45:09,693
Go on, take it.

360
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,359
Now leave.

361
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:16,651
But we wanted to practice!
It won't work.

362
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,651
Why not?
Because you won't cut it.

363
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:25,526
Now just take...
Take the money

364
00:45:26,276 --> 00:45:28,318
and leave.
We could at least try...

365
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:30,818
Take your bag.
Just for a few days.

366
00:45:31,276 --> 00:45:33,359
If it doesn't work,
I'll leave.

367
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:43,193
Please.

368
00:45:47,484 --> 00:45:48,443
Please.

369
00:46:01,568 --> 00:46:03,193
Sit down on
the other side.

370
00:46:29,901 --> 00:46:31,859
Here's a specimen.

371
00:46:33,526 --> 00:46:35,609
You must be able
to write like her.

372
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:37,651
Practice it.

373
00:46:42,443 --> 00:46:44,193
It's a shopping list.

374
00:46:44,443 --> 00:46:46,234
Yes, it's what
we'll start with.

375
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:50,234
Now practice.

376
00:46:57,984 --> 00:46:59,484
Is that all you own?

377
00:47:03,068 --> 00:47:04,943
I'll see what
I can organize.

378
00:47:05,568 --> 00:47:06,734
Practice.

379
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:09,943
There's some
food left over.

380
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:15,318
Thanks.

381
00:48:30,693 --> 00:48:32,109
You needn't have bothered.

382
00:48:32,526 --> 00:48:34,443
There's no money
in the draw.

383
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,234
What?

384
00:48:37,401 --> 00:48:40,151
Oh, that.

385
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:42,859
I needed examples.
Of what?

386
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:44,818
Her handwriting.

387
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:47,818
I'd finished the
shopping list

388
00:48:49,234 --> 00:48:51,651
and needed more material.
Show me.

389
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:56,276
It's... lying on the table.

390
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,859
You didn't trace it?

391
00:49:11,276 --> 00:49:12,359
No.

392
00:49:17,193 --> 00:49:19,859
200 G MARGARINE,
4 EGGS, SUGAR, RAISINS, 1 LEMON

393
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:25,734
Sit up.

394
00:49:41,693 --> 00:49:44,443
I'll never get used
to driving on the left.

395
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,609
Write it.

396
00:49:49,443 --> 00:49:50,651
Oh, I see...

397
00:49:54,526 --> 00:49:57,193
I'll never get used to
driving on the left.

398
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:29,234
Write:

399
00:50:30,818 --> 00:50:32,568
I am alive and
will return soon.

400
00:50:33,151 --> 00:50:34,609
Signed, Nelly Lenz.

401
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:43,943
This is her signature.

402
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:16,526
It's almost identical.

403
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:21,359
Good. You can sleep here,
we'll continue tomorrow.

404
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:51,818
Good morning.
Good morning.

405
00:51:54,568 --> 00:51:56,526
I brought you
some things.

406
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:02,776
Are they...
Nelly's things?

407
00:52:03,276 --> 00:52:04,526
They were burnt.

408
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:06,943
There are only
the shoes.

409
00:52:16,693 --> 00:52:18,359
They are from Paris!

410
00:52:19,068 --> 00:52:21,859
Try them on.
Try the shoes.

411
00:52:29,234 --> 00:52:31,859
Did you buy them for her?
I think so.

412
00:52:47,318 --> 00:52:48,693
Do they fit?

413
00:52:53,193 --> 00:52:54,526
Did you go to
Paris together?

414
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:04,734
I need to know these things.
Try the other. Walk around in them.

415
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:40,734
Do they pinch?

416
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:51,401
So why are you
walking so strangely?

417
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:53,401
We'll need to
practice that, too.

418
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:57,526
I only just got up.

419
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:03,109
I haven't had breakfast.
The water's boiling. We'll eat soon.

420
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:04,943
Now please walk normally.

421
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,276
It's too long.

422
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:00,443
Can you sew?

423
00:55:01,734 --> 00:55:04,568
I mean, take it in.
The dress?

424
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:12,068
Her dresses ended
just below the knee.

425
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,484
Always nice and short,
broad and airy.

426
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,526
Can you manage that?
Is that my coffee?

427
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,068
Your hair is awful.

428
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:25,568
Something's got to
be done about it.

429
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:28,443
Nelly always
dyed her hair.

430
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,651
Anything else?
A hell of a lot.

431
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:33,734
We're only starting.

432
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:37,734
If we manage, I mean
once we're done here,

433
00:55:38,484 --> 00:55:40,526
you'll take a train
from the east

434
00:55:40,693 --> 00:55:42,943
and we'll meet you
at the station.

435
00:55:44,151 --> 00:55:45,526
And I'll be...

436
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,526
in a red dress and
shoes from Paris?

437
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:56,026
You think anyone leaves
the camps like that?

438
00:55:58,568 --> 00:56:00,568
Nobody will buy it.

439
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,651
You've seen the returnees.

440
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:08,026
All the burn wounds
and shot-up faces!

441
00:56:08,859 --> 00:56:12,026
No one looks at them.
Everyone avoids them.

442
00:56:12,276 --> 00:56:15,484
But we want them to look
at you and say, it's Nelly!

443
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:19,276
Nelly made it!
She's back!

444
00:56:19,484 --> 00:56:22,359
She's wearing a broad
dress and nice shoes

445
00:56:22,568 --> 00:56:24,068
because she's so glad.

446
00:56:25,443 --> 00:56:27,651
It's this that'll
get us what we want.

447
00:56:36,984 --> 00:56:38,776
This lot will
be meeting you,

448
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:41,734
and these you might
meet after arrival.

449
00:56:42,526 --> 00:56:44,443
Names and some details.

450
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,401
Learn it all by heart.

451
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:52,443
I'll be with you, I'll help.
If need be, throw a crying fit.

452
00:56:53,401 --> 00:56:54,943
As if you're overwhelmed.

453
00:56:55,193 --> 00:56:57,818
Or just hug them,
then I'll intervene.

454
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:01,776
We'll practice it.

455
00:57:03,859 --> 00:57:06,484
The ones with
crosses are dead.

456
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:08,484
Learn about them, anyway.

457
00:57:09,234 --> 00:57:11,901
That one was shot in Lichtenberg.
He was a Nazi.

458
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:14,526
This one?
That one.

459
00:57:14,818 --> 00:57:16,109
And her, too.

460
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:25,276
Do you...
have any photos of Nelly?

461
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,818
I'd so much like
to see her.

462
00:57:29,151 --> 00:57:31,068
Later.
Study those ones now.

463
00:57:31,526 --> 00:57:34,526
What color eyes did Nelly have?
Same as you.

464
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:36,859
What color is that?
Blue.

465
00:58:31,693 --> 00:58:33,109
Good morning.

466
00:58:35,193 --> 00:58:37,151
Good morning.

467
00:58:52,068 --> 00:58:54,443
I've found the solution
for your hair.

468
00:58:56,276 --> 00:58:58,734
It's not my wife,
she's an actress.

469
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:01,359
Nelly really liked
that picture.

470
00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:04,734
The look of her make-up.

471
00:59:05,151 --> 00:59:06,359
The hair.

472
00:59:06,568 --> 00:59:09,443
She copied it.
Particularly for performances.

473
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:12,193
At all performances,
in fact.

474
00:59:12,651 --> 00:59:14,151
Think you can do it?

475
00:59:16,234 --> 00:59:18,568
You know how to apply
make-up, right?

476
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:21,276
I've brought you some.

477
00:59:22,109 --> 00:59:23,526
And something
for your hair.

478
00:59:24,151 --> 00:59:25,734
The color should be right.

479
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:37,318
It won't work, it...

480
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,651
I can't come from
a camp like that.

481
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:45,609
I explained that already.
No, that's all...

482
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,276
They want Nelly, not a
ragged camp-internee.

483
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:52,526
That's what we're
working on here.

484
00:59:58,401 --> 01:00:00,318
If I'm coming...

485
01:00:01,068 --> 01:00:04,484
from a camp,
someone is bound to ask me

486
01:00:07,276 --> 01:00:10,526
what I experienced there,
what I...

487
01:00:10,818 --> 01:00:12,068
What?

488
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,318
How it was there,

489
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:19,734
and I'll need a story.
What kind of story?

490
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,526
What?
Something or other.

491
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:31,526
Like...

492
01:00:33,193 --> 01:00:35,068
how we sat on a beam,

493
01:00:37,484 --> 01:00:38,818
naked and...

494
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:44,901
went through the clothing

495
01:00:46,568 --> 01:00:49,693
of those who had just arrived,

496
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:53,859
while the Kapos
stood around us.

497
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,526
We had to check
for banknotes,

498
01:00:58,359 --> 01:01:01,651
or jewels they'd hidden,

499
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:04,609
And then this...

500
01:01:05,443 --> 01:01:07,943
girl, this girl...

501
01:01:08,193 --> 01:01:10,901
looks at me.
She looks at me.

502
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:13,026
This girl looks at me...

503
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:17,818
Where does the story come from?
She's got her mother's dress...

504
01:01:20,234 --> 01:01:21,526
Where from?
I...

505
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:27,526
I read it.

506
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:35,484
Then tell it.

507
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,068
If anyone asks.

508
01:01:39,276 --> 01:01:40,359
Yes.

509
01:01:41,984 --> 01:01:43,859
But I assure you,
no one will.

510
01:01:46,901 --> 01:01:48,776
None of this lot will ask.

511
01:01:50,776 --> 01:01:52,276
Right.
No one.

512
01:01:58,526 --> 01:02:00,484
You did well.
With the dress.

513
01:02:07,484 --> 01:02:09,568
Johnny!
I said don't call me that.

514
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:15,401
Where are you going?

515
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:19,651
I've got to go out.
I've got to go out, too.

516
01:02:19,943 --> 01:02:21,359
Wait.

517
01:03:16,984 --> 01:03:18,484
Do you recognize me?

518
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,401
Johnny.

519
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:38,151
Enough!
Enough!

520
01:03:44,068 --> 01:03:45,818
What have you caked
your face with?

521
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:50,526
The eye make-up is wrong.
Your walk, too. Everything.

522
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:52,109
It's all wrong.

523
01:03:53,234 --> 01:03:54,901
Did you at least
learn by heart?

524
01:04:04,526 --> 01:04:07,568
I have to go out.
No, no...

525
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:09,651
I must.
You can't.

526
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:12,109
If you go and someone
recognizes you,

527
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:14,359
it was all in vain.
No one will.

528
01:04:14,568 --> 01:04:16,776
I have to go out!

529
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,568
Please.

530
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,484
First the grocer
wouldn't sell to us.

531
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:39,484
Then Mr. Schmidt-Ott
opposite.

532
01:04:40,568 --> 01:04:42,609
Nelly was banned
from singing.

533
01:04:42,818 --> 01:04:44,776
No friends came
by anymore.

534
01:04:45,693 --> 01:04:49,026
Sigrid and Walter Hochbaum
lived on the third floor.

535
01:04:49,943 --> 01:04:51,859
They stopped coming, too.

536
01:04:53,609 --> 01:04:55,901
I had to hide Nelly
in winter '43.

537
01:04:57,151 --> 01:04:59,151
Lehmann wouldn't let her
in the bomb shelter.

538
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,526
We were sure he'd
denounced Nelly soon.

539
01:05:02,068 --> 01:05:04,068
He envied us
our apartment.

540
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:09,526
A friend who died at the front
had a houseboat on a nearby lake.

541
01:05:09,734 --> 01:05:11,901
That's where I brought her.

542
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:16,359
How did we meet?

543
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:21,568
Put your hat on.
People are coming.

544
01:05:21,776 --> 01:05:22,776
Come on.

545
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,651
Did you often go walking
with her. Yes.

546
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:38,651
At night?

547
01:05:40,276 --> 01:05:41,526
That too, yes.

548
01:05:43,651 --> 01:05:45,526
Where would you go to?

549
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,526
Did you have
favorite places?

550
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:50,359
Of course.

551
01:05:50,776 --> 01:05:52,318
What were they?

552
01:05:53,484 --> 01:05:56,193
Let's go. The weather is turning.
So?

553
01:05:56,609 --> 01:05:58,734
Shall we go and
sit down there?

554
01:05:59,984 --> 01:06:01,193
Stop it!

555
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:18,568
Stop it!

556
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:23,109
What? Stay away from
the photos in my drawer.

557
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:24,859
Of course.
Then do so!

558
01:06:25,109 --> 01:06:27,651
I didn't look at them.
Quit playing Nelly!

559
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,318
I know you're not her!

560
01:06:29,651 --> 01:06:31,276
It's not me you
must convince!

561
01:06:35,443 --> 01:06:37,901
Where is your hat?
On the bench.

562
01:06:40,443 --> 01:06:43,568
Coming for a beer later on?
Sure. Look!

563
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:46,234
How beautiful
to be in love!

564
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,359
Here.

565
01:07:31,193 --> 01:07:34,484
I'd not have survived the
camp except for Johnny.

566
01:07:36,526 --> 01:07:40,234
I only thought about
how I'd come back to him.

567
01:07:42,901 --> 01:07:44,609
And when I
finally got here

568
01:07:45,193 --> 01:07:47,068
I simply had
to look for him.

569
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:51,193
And when I finally
found him

570
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,859
he didn't recognize me.

571
01:07:54,276 --> 01:07:55,693
And it was...

572
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:59,943
Lene, it was...
I was... dead again.

573
01:08:02,484 --> 01:08:03,734
And...

574
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:06,901
now he's made me
back into Nelly again.

575
01:08:24,151 --> 01:08:25,901
I can't come to Palestine.

576
01:08:27,734 --> 01:08:29,193
Where will
you go instead?

577
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:35,526
With Johnny... back with him.
Impossible.

578
01:08:35,734 --> 01:08:37,901
Lene, since being
back with him

579
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:39,943
I'm myself again.
No.

580
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,234
When he speaks of her...
Of her!

581
01:08:44,568 --> 01:08:46,901
I'm really jealous... of me!

582
01:08:48,568 --> 01:08:51,651
When will you tell him?
I don't know.

583
01:08:53,193 --> 01:08:56,401
Lene, it's as if we were
just getting acquainted.

584
01:08:56,734 --> 01:08:58,443
For the first time,
you hear?

585
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:01,234
And how is
this to go on?

586
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:05,234
Soon I arrive by train.
He'll inform you about it.

587
01:09:06,068 --> 01:09:07,651
Then I'll be here again.

588
01:09:08,818 --> 01:09:12,609
That'll be my return.
Then he'll go after your money.

589
01:09:28,734 --> 01:09:30,818
Do you know what
disgusts me?

590
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:34,318
We Jews wrote,

591
01:09:34,776 --> 01:09:36,276
sang and slaved...

592
01:09:36,734 --> 01:09:39,943
went to war for Germany,
yet we were gassed, one and all.

593
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:44,068
And now the survivors
return and forgive.

594
01:09:44,693 --> 01:09:46,526
The gassing ceases
and we forgive...

595
01:09:49,526 --> 01:09:52,276
all counts of cowardice
and treachery.

596
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,818
I won't go along
with it, Nelly.

597
01:10:04,984 --> 01:10:07,026
Lene, I know he loves her.

598
01:10:11,526 --> 01:10:13,693
I don't believe
he betrayed her.

599
01:10:16,401 --> 01:10:18,943
When you were
sitting in the dark

600
01:10:19,193 --> 01:10:22,443
I thought you'd shot him
and needed my help.

601
01:10:23,776 --> 01:10:25,943
And honestly,
I'd have preferred that.

602
01:11:33,484 --> 01:11:35,193
I'll wait for you here.

603
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:20,318
Mrs. Lenz!

604
01:12:24,151 --> 01:12:26,151
I'm so happy
to see you again.

605
01:12:31,859 --> 01:12:33,401
Is your husband, too?

606
01:12:35,193 --> 01:12:37,484
You know how men
are these days.

607
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:40,734
And how are they?

608
01:12:47,151 --> 01:12:48,734
Can I offer you something?

609
01:12:49,943 --> 01:12:51,526
We have real coffee...

610
01:12:53,193 --> 01:12:54,609
for our good guests.

611
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:57,734
Elsie, make us a coffee.

612
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:10,359
Did you know I was hiding
down in the boat?

613
01:13:13,193 --> 01:13:14,443
No.

614
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:16,734
No.

615
01:13:19,901 --> 01:13:21,151
I saw you...

616
01:13:22,234 --> 01:13:23,526
at the window...

617
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:26,859
when I was arrested.

618
01:13:27,776 --> 01:13:29,318
You and your husband.

619
01:13:31,318 --> 01:13:32,693
It was horrific.

620
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:37,526
What could we
have done?

621
01:13:40,151 --> 01:13:42,359
I said the same
to your husband.

622
01:13:44,068 --> 01:13:45,651
We were so afraid.

623
01:13:48,568 --> 01:13:50,776
And you know our son...
My...

624
01:13:51,401 --> 01:13:53,109
husband was here again?

625
01:13:54,443 --> 01:13:55,901
Yes, after your arrest.

626
01:13:58,276 --> 01:13:59,443
When?

627
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:02,318
Right away.

628
01:15:32,776 --> 01:15:34,026
What are you doing here?

629
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:41,401
It must...
have been cold

630
01:15:42,318 --> 01:15:43,693
that winter.

631
01:15:48,901 --> 01:15:50,526
How was it with
the innkeepers?

632
01:15:54,776 --> 01:15:56,484
You were right.

633
01:15:58,568 --> 01:16:02,151
The landlady didn't ask
me about the camps.

634
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:06,359
But she did call
me Mrs. Lenz.

635
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:09,901
And she cried.

636
01:16:13,651 --> 01:16:16,401
You were here the day
Nelly was arrested?

637
01:16:16,568 --> 01:16:17,609
Says who?

638
01:16:17,984 --> 01:16:19,151
The landlady.

639
01:16:22,193 --> 01:16:23,526
Let's go.

640
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:39,818
Did you betray Nelly?

641
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,568
Sometimes...

642
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:51,026
it's not a real betrayal.

643
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,068
You hid her...

644
01:16:57,693 --> 01:17:00,401
had to take care of
her all that time...

645
01:17:02,776 --> 01:17:05,443
Then came arrest
and interrogation.

646
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:09,401
Finally you are
suddenly released.

647
01:17:10,651 --> 01:17:13,359
You hurry to
check up on her.

648
01:17:14,693 --> 01:17:17,193
You don't notice
you're being followed.

649
01:17:21,318 --> 01:17:22,859
Then it's too late.

650
01:17:24,318 --> 01:17:25,526
You just stand there

651
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:27,526
and there's nothing
you can do.

652
01:17:29,234 --> 01:17:31,484
You have to watch Nelly
being taken away.

653
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,151
Get off.

654
01:17:47,693 --> 01:17:48,859
Come along.

655
01:17:57,609 --> 01:17:59,776
We'll have Nelly
return next week.

656
01:18:05,193 --> 01:18:07,318
At the station
there'll be me,

657
01:18:07,776 --> 01:18:09,318
Sigrid, Monika,

658
01:18:09,693 --> 01:18:12,318
Frederike,
Walther and Alfred.

659
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:16,943
A train will arrive,
many people will get off.

660
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,734
You'll be sitting
to the rear.

661
01:18:20,401 --> 01:18:22,109
The train will
start to move,

662
01:18:23,318 --> 01:18:24,776
then they will see you...

663
01:18:25,193 --> 01:18:26,526
in the red dress...

664
01:18:26,734 --> 01:18:28,109
and the shoes from Paris.

665
01:18:29,568 --> 01:18:31,151
The Nelly of the past.

666
01:18:31,859 --> 01:18:33,234
They will be relieved.

667
01:18:33,443 --> 01:18:34,943
They'll run towards you.

668
01:18:35,568 --> 01:18:37,609
Sigrid will be first.
She always is.

669
01:18:38,109 --> 01:18:41,776
She'll pretend to be speechless:
'I don't believe it.'

670
01:18:42,568 --> 01:18:44,693
'Nelly!'
Then she'll hug you.

671
01:18:47,151 --> 01:18:49,776
Alfred, as ever,
will say, 'Little Nelly.'

672
01:18:49,984 --> 01:18:52,526
It might almost be,
'How you've grown.'

673
01:18:53,526 --> 01:18:55,776
Monika will tell you
about her husband.

674
01:18:57,068 --> 01:18:59,193
'I always knew
you'd come back.'

675
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:04,276
Frederike will complain as usual
about her life and Berlin.

676
01:19:05,193 --> 01:19:07,151
What about us?

677
01:19:08,734 --> 01:19:10,484
We'll walk up
to each other.

678
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,693
Very tentatively.

679
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:18,359
We won't speak...

680
01:19:19,193 --> 01:19:21,234
kiss or fall upon
each other.

681
01:19:25,609 --> 01:19:27,068
We will simply hug.

682
01:19:28,568 --> 01:19:30,818
You'll lay your head
on my shoulder

683
01:19:33,776 --> 01:19:35,568
and we'll both
shut our eyes.

684
01:19:37,818 --> 01:19:39,193
We'll do nothing else.

685
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:41,901
Nothing.
For ages.

686
01:20:29,193 --> 01:20:34,026
Ref: Mrs.Schwarz was in my employ
From March to September, 1945.

687
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:36,318
She is an excellent housekeeper...

688
01:20:36,526 --> 01:20:38,526
She left you a letter, too.

689
01:20:55,193 --> 01:20:56,693
I am to give it to you.

690
01:21:01,484 --> 01:21:02,943
But where is Lene, then?

691
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:05,276
You don't know?

692
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:09,734
Mrs. Winter shot
herself on Thursday.

693
01:21:30,443 --> 01:21:31,693
Dear Nelly,

694
01:21:33,109 --> 01:21:35,484
I told you there is
no way back for us.

695
01:21:36,776 --> 01:21:39,359
But for me there's no
way forwards, either.

696
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:43,401
I feel more drawn to our
dead than to our living.

697
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,651
I cannot keep
this from you.

698
01:21:50,734 --> 01:21:52,526
Your husband divorced you

699
01:21:52,901 --> 01:21:54,859
directly before your arrest.

700
01:21:55,901 --> 01:21:58,901
I enclose a copy of
the relevant document.

701
01:21:59,693 --> 01:22:01,109
Farewell,

702
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:03,359
Lene

703
01:22:11,151 --> 01:22:12,568
Wait.
I'll get the key.

704
01:23:23,318 --> 01:23:26,526
The train arrives around eight.
Is half an hour enough...

705
01:23:26,818 --> 01:23:29,151
for a wash,
make-up and hair?

706
01:23:32,276 --> 01:23:34,068
Or do you need
three-quarters?

707
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:37,776
Well, Nelly?

708
01:23:42,568 --> 01:23:45,026
Calling me that, now?

709
01:23:48,401 --> 01:23:49,609
A slip, I guess.

710
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:01,026
I'm afraid this
will hurt a little.

711
01:24:05,734 --> 01:24:07,859
Prisoners of Auschwitz
were tattooed.

712
01:24:09,568 --> 01:24:12,068
With a number
on the forearm.

713
01:24:13,693 --> 01:24:16,109
Someone will ask
about your number.

714
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:18,151
And you'll whisper...

715
01:24:18,693 --> 01:24:20,443
that you cut it out.

716
01:24:21,943 --> 01:24:23,859
There'll be no
further questions.

717
01:24:26,276 --> 01:24:27,776
Get out.

718
01:25:03,568 --> 01:25:06,234
In the name of
The German People!

719
01:25:06,443 --> 01:25:08,401
October 4, 1944...

720
01:25:08,568 --> 01:25:10,568
Johannes Lenz...
Divorce... Nelly Lenz

721
01:26:21,318 --> 01:26:22,609
I don't believe it.

722
01:26:24,234 --> 01:26:25,943
It's so...

723
01:26:26,651 --> 01:26:27,776
I don't know...

724
01:26:31,568 --> 01:26:33,526
Come have a hug.

725
01:26:43,943 --> 01:26:45,318
I told Wolfgang...

726
01:26:45,984 --> 01:26:47,609
Nelly will be back,
I know it.

727
01:26:47,984 --> 01:26:50,818
If only he could
see you, too...

728
01:26:52,193 --> 01:26:53,151
If...

729
01:27:06,318 --> 01:27:07,818
Well, Nelly...

730
01:27:09,234 --> 01:27:10,651
Christina is dead.

731
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:13,693
My child is dead.

732
01:27:18,318 --> 01:27:21,276
But now go over to Johnny.
There he is.

733
01:28:04,984 --> 01:28:07,526
Let's go, kids.
The food's getting cold.

734
01:28:45,984 --> 01:28:47,276
We missed you.

735
01:28:49,776 --> 01:28:52,276
Two days ago I
passed the studio.

736
01:28:53,943 --> 01:28:56,609
The circular bench where
you always sat together.

737
01:28:57,609 --> 01:28:59,568
The street lighting
was back on.

738
01:29:01,443 --> 01:29:04,901
A piano was playing inside.
Someone was singing.

739
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:10,068
I shut my eyes.

740
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:14,568
And for an instant it
was as it used to be.

741
01:29:17,193 --> 01:29:19,234
Yes...
And now here you are, Nelly.

742
01:29:20,526 --> 01:29:23,276
I don't have to close
my eyes to see you.

743
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,734
And I never will again.

744
01:29:28,526 --> 01:29:30,526
To your being
back again, Nelly.

745
01:29:30,734 --> 01:29:32,597
To Nelly.
To Nelly.

746
01:29:32,779 --> 01:29:34,361
Cheers.

747
01:29:43,443 --> 01:29:44,526
Nelly...

748
01:29:46,234 --> 01:29:47,526
You are my love.

749
01:29:49,068 --> 01:29:50,526
You are my life.

750
01:29:51,984 --> 01:29:53,568
No matter what.

751
01:30:11,193 --> 01:30:12,443
Come on.

752
01:30:13,109 --> 01:30:14,443
All of you come.

753
01:30:25,484 --> 01:30:27,193
'Speak Low'.

754
01:30:27,609 --> 01:30:29,234
'Speak Low'.
Yes.

755
01:30:46,568 --> 01:30:48,943
I always wished...

756
01:30:50,276 --> 01:30:51,818
to sing with Johnny again...

757
01:30:52,401 --> 01:30:53,693
one day...

758
01:30:54,276 --> 01:30:55,651
