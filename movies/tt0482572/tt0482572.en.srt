Let's fucking move.
Get these cars out of here!

134
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:41,731
Yo, we gotta make a lane for the bus.

Upstairs, second floor.

We've got the block locked down,
the crime scene secured.

A level-three mobilization

Jimmy.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

156
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,286
What the fuck?

157
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,268
<i>They entered a tenement
at 186th and Audubon.</i>

158
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,930
<i>For the purpose of?
- Responding to shots fired.</i>

159
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,808
Two were DOA at the scene,
Officer Cavanaugh pronounced en route.

160
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,072
My last guy Lonnie Mercer's
up in surgery now.

161
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:35,273
All right. Where are we on task force?

162
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,315
Being assembled. Smitty's on point.

163
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:39,113
All right. I want the best men available.

164
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:43,384
The severity of the situation
is such I want cops we can trust.

165
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:51,864
Don't beat yourself up here, Franny.
There's no blame in this.

166
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,696
There's not a goddamned thing
any one of us could've done.

167
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,664
My cops, my command, Pop.

168
00:08:56,838 --> 00:09:00,137
We lose officers in the line, Francis.
It's not your fault.

169
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:04,109
Forty years wading through shit like this,
watching our guys die.

170
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,371
You keep the rage.

171
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:08,547
You cut the rest of it loose.

172
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:28,626
Any word?

173
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:36,038
Pop's here.

174
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,044
<i>Dr. King, please call the operating room.</i>

175
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:40,873
Excuse me.
- I'm sorry...

176
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,483
Let me go! I wanna see
my fucking husband.

177
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:46,382
I can't let you back here.
There's nothing I can do.

178
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:48,352
I wanna see my fucking husband!

179
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:51,321
Trish.
- I wanna see my fucking husband!

180
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:54,360
I wanna see his face.

181
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,588
I'm sorry, Trish. I'm so sorry.

182
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,493
Oh, my God.

183
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:36,628
Hey, kiddo.

184
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:38,102
Hey, Pop.

185
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:40,173
Hell of a thing, huh?

186
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:46,675
Good you came.

187
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,080
You were there for Lonnie at least, huh?

188
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:51,318
Yeah.

189
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:55,855
I sat down with Bill Avery and Armstrong.
We're gearing up task force.

190
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,322
Yeah, well, everyone's gonna
want in on that.

191
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:02,389
You're gonna get all the oranges.

192
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:05,328
How about you throw your hat in the ring?
Make a phone call.

193
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,899
Me?

194
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:11,331
No. No, definitely not.

195
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,474
Don't you think it's time you got back...

196
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:16,304
...after two years on the tit
feeling sorry for yourself?

197
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:19,038
I don't feel sorry for myself.
I'm just not up for that.

198
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:23,014
How about Lonnie? You feel sorry for him?
His wife, his kids?

199
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:26,382
- You guys came up together.
- Oh, come on. Don't lay that on me, okay?

200
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,887
- If it was you, he'd be all over this.
- Yeah.

201
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:31,287
- Be the first one signing up.
- I know that.

202
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:36,090
Not a goddamn thing I can do
for Lonnie now, Pop.

203
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:38,459
I held his hand
in the back of that ambulance...

204
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,794
...and even that didn't do any good.

205
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:44,361
He died looking into the face
of a friend, Raymond.

206
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,166
Yeah.

207
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:53,680
You're too smart not to know
that you're wasting your talent...

208
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,373
...in goddamn Missing Persons.

209
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:01,113
- For you, it's a fucking dumping ground.
- Yeah, well, it doesn't bother me.

210
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,018
It bothers you.

211
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,726
Yeah, look.

212
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:07,555
Pop, it's been a shitty night, okay?

213
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,924
I just wanna get out
of these fucking clothes...

214
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:12,157
...and wash this whole day off.
I'll see you.

215
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,325
Don't turn your back on me, Raymond.

216
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:18,633
You're my kid, my blood, but you
might as well be a fucking Martian.

217
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:20,765
Okay.

218
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,979
I'm gonna say what I'm gonna say,
and then I'm out of here.

219
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:27,842
I'm walking out, and it's over.

220
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:30,150
I want you on the task force.

221
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,678
I want you on the task force.

222
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:36,221
But fuck if I'm gonna go after
a favor and have you run from it.

223
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:39,292
Now, the men who were killed
were under your brother's command.

224
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:43,591
You could be a benefit here and show you're
worth all that early praise and promise.

225
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:46,825
Show everybody that gives a shit
that you haven't abandoned them.

226
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:50,165
Now, Raymond, do me a favor.
Forget the past.

227
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:52,306
Forget Mott Haven, all that shit.

228
00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:55,932
Now is now. I know it's a hell of a thing
to break back in on...

229
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:59,808
...but you worked those streets. You know
the neighborhoods up and down. Yes?

230
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,710
Yeah, I worked those streets, Pop.

231
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,976
Okay, so you take the task-force spot...

232
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:06,950
...and you go at it
with all the gifts God gave you.

233
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:14,624
Cops died here, Raymond.

234
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:16,559
Four cops.

235
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:22,200
And no matter what we've forsaken
of ourselves, we can't forsake them.

236
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:26,071
Don't sit on your hands here, kiddo.

237
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:30,267
Don't sit on your hands here.

238
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,853
<i>I knew you couldn't stay away
from all this forever.</i>

239
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:41,420
<i>Yeah, don't get used to it.</i>

240
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,423
So, what do we got?
Crime Scene process these tracks?

241
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:45,924
Yeah, it's done.

242
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:49,860
They get anything off the canvass?
- Uh-uh. Still pending, bro.

243
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,498
So they found our guy up there?

244
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,999
Yeah, Gillick.
Must've went up when it popped off.

245
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,934
Got hit halfway up,
fell back on the landing.

246
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:01,439
Wait, they're still calling this a 911, right?
Shots-fired call?

247
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,544
Yeah. Why?

248
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:07,005
Well... I mean...

249
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:09,817
I don't know, man.
How you figure this went down?

250
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:13,648
I mean, our guys go in, maybe they
take down the guy right inside the door.

251
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:17,758
Then the whole thing touches off and you
got a lot of firing, very close quarters.

252
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:21,692
So that shooter, I mean, wherever he is,
he could've split, but he didn't.

253
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:23,854
He dug in, shot it out.

254
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:26,398
I mean, maybe he
surprised them somehow.

255
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,263
Maybe.

256
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:30,502
Somebody hit him.

257
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:34,506
He comes out,
catches Gillick coming up the stairs.

258
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:37,372
Then he comes down,
he's dumping blood all over the place.

259
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:40,241
And he splits for the street.
Then he does what?

260
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:43,179
He didn't hail a cab.
He have a car waiting?

261
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:46,377
Go.
- Could've jacked somebody.

262
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,348
Whoever he was, he was no amateur.

263
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:54,188
No, he's just a lucky
motherfucking perp, man.

264
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:58,161
Maybe.

265
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,999
What's up, Ray?

266
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:05,733
Is that you?

267
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,606
No.

268
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,471
Is that yours?

269
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,273
Where is that?

270
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:16,314
I got it, I got it.
- No, no, don't touch that. Don't touch that.

271
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,324
You got a bag?

272
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:35,734
All right. All right, listen up.
Here's what we got.

273
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:38,566
We ran the stamp name on the smack
recovered at the scene.

274
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,264
It's called WMD.

275
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:44,310
Six hits, six names.
Their sheets and mug shots are inside.

276
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:48,210
Not a big group, so we should be able to
iso these fuckers and close them out.

277
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:50,112
So I'm gonna say it again.

278
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:52,480
Share your information. Anything.

279
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:56,084
Hints, hunches,
any scrap or shred of information.

280
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:59,590
I don't care if it goes off the back
of a matchbook, a strung-out CI.

281
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:02,628
Put it inside the fives, get it in print
and get it to me.

282
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:04,094
- Where's our list?
- I got it.

283
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:06,062
Anybody speak Spanish?

284
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:09,465
- Yeah, I'm all right. What's up?
- I need some help with an interview.

285
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,298
Hey, vouch that and do a dump on it.

286
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:13,805
- See how quick they can turn it around.
- All right.

287
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:15,465
- What's up?
- Got a kid inside...

288
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:19,306
...who might have seen something, but
I can't understand a word they're saying.

289
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:21,210
<i>And papi's giving me a hard time.</i>

290
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:24,840
- Yeah, all right. I'll give it a shot.
- All right.

291
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:44,095
Yeah, all of it.

292
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:48,542
That's right. Take it easy.
You hit the calm button, all right?

293
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,441
If I gotta put an arm on you, you're
gonna spend Christmas in central booking.

294
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:29,107
He's just a little boy.
You don't understand.

295
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:31,149
No, I know, I know.

296
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,880
I just need him to point me
in the right direction. Please.

297
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:39,516
Come on, now. We really need
your help here. Just five minutes, okay?

298
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:47,564
Whoa, whoa, whoa. My man, calm down.
It's the fucking holidays.

299
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:07,779
It's Manny?

300
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,925
- You speak English okay, Manny?
- Uh-huh.

301
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,657
Okay. This is gonna be easy. Okay.

302
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,827
So...

303
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:23,101
Now, you remember last night?

304
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,364
There was some loud noises
across the street.

305
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,167
Guns?

306
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:29,776
Yeah, there were guns.
You know what guns sound like?

307
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:32,708
I hear them lots of times.

308
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:36,210
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

309
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:41,346
Okay, so when you heard the guns,
where were you?

310
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:44,082
Were you over by the door
in your daddy's shop?

311
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,283
Uh-huh.

312
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,725
Yeah? Could you see out onto the street?
Did you have a good view of the street?

313
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:50,125
Mm-hm.

314
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:53,528
Okay. Now, when the guns
stopped shooting...

315
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:59,003
...do you remember if a man ran out
from behind that building?

316
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:00,572
Uh-huh.

317
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:03,174
And did he get into a car?

318
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:05,778
- Uh-huh.
- He did.

319
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:08,575
Okay, now,
I want you to think for a second.

320
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,684
Did that man look like
he was hurt to you?

321
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:15,118
In the leg, he was bleeding.

322
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,690
In the leg, he was bleeding.

323
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:21,827
- In the belly, he was...
- In his belly?

324
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,122
Uh-huh.

325
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:28,062
Okay. Manny, that's the guy
that I'm looking for. Okay?

326
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:33,435
So I'm gonna show you some pictures.
Just a couple pictures of people.

327
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:38,102
And if you see the guy that you saw,
the guy who got in that car, you tell me.

328
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,610
Manny.

329
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:45,544
Okay? All right.

330
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:48,485
How about this guy?

331
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,922
Is that him?

332
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:58,327
How about him?

333
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,530
No?

334
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,266
How about him?

335
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,502
How about that one?

336
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:13,307
That's the man?

337
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:16,340
That's the man that you saw?

338
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,041
Mm-hm.

339
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,044
You sure?

340
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:24,791
Do you remember
what color that car was?

341
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,622
- Um. White.
- White.

342
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:30,957
<i>- You sound pretty sure about that.
- Uh-huh.</i>

343
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,391
<i>It was a cab.</i>

344
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:36,036
<i>But not the yellow kind.</i>

345
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:38,229
<i>Manny, you're good, man.</i>

346
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:41,603
<i>You don't remember if it had two doors
or four doors, do you?</i>

347
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:44,336
<i>Um... Four.</i>

348
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,673
<i>You have a great memory.</i>

349
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:50,306
<i>Anything else?
You remember anything else?</i>

350
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,476
<i>He looked scared.</i>

351
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:55,554
<i>Who? Who looked scared?</i>

352
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:58,988
<i>The man driving the car.</i>

353
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:02,191
<i>He looked really scared.</i>

354
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,148
What do we got?

355
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:31,121
It's the fucking cabbie. Tezo must've
whacked him and had someone pick him up.

356
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:32,850
<i>He's a fucking que pasף, Jimmy.</i>

357
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:36,224
Fucking termite choking on splinters,
had a run of good fucking luck.

358
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:38,092
No one's that fucking lucky, Kenny.

359
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:41,929
Tezo got tipped off our boys were
coming through that door to get him.

360
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,900
Christ.

361
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:46,331
You gotta give
the little fuck credit, though.

362
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:50,068
On the fly, under pressure?
It's a fucking tight piece of work here.

363
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:53,270
We gotta find this guy, Jimmy.
We gotta kill this prick.

364
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:54,540
These guys were... Jesus.

365
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,910
Hey, do me a big favor, all right?
All of you.

366
00:21:57,085 --> 00:22:00,316
Say nothing about this I don't already
know. It's a waste of fucking words.

367
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:05,022
They're dead. Our money's missing. There's
only one of those things we can get back.

368
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:08,257
Yeah, we all loved those guys.

369
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:11,990
It was a shitty way to punch out,
so pray they died quick and leave it alone.

370
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,157
First things first, we got handed up.

371
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:16,769
By who, we're gonna find out
real quick. Get the can.

372
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:18,838
We gotta pull the pin on this fuck now.

373
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,442
- The rat squad gets an angle on this...
- They'll blow our shit sky-high.

374
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,907
What about Casado?

375
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:27,377
What about him? Still wants Tezo
taken out. Nothing's changed.

376
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,573
How do we know Tezo
didn't jet out of town?

377
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,843
Because his fucking juice is here.

378
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,921
Goes somewhere else speaking next to no
English, he's fucking washing dishes.

379
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:38,551
Get it good, Kenny.

380
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:42,958
We leave nothing for them. We stay out
in front of the task force on this.

381
00:22:43,131 --> 00:22:46,191
You got a gun, you got passport
to wherever this prick's holed up.

382
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,934
Toss every block in the five boroughs
till we find this piece of shit.

383
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:36,149
I'm sorry, Mr. Tezo.

384
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:37,978
I'm sorry.

385
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:42,680
Baby.

386
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,958
Bring me a potato.

387
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,287
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:52,295
Damn it. Fuck, I don't like that.

389
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:12,551
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
It hurts. I am sorry.

390
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:15,079
Hello?

391
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,521
Oh, you think?
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

392
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,566
I'm gonna fucking cut you, doc.

393
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:33,897
Okay, we are done.
That should do it for us.

394
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:39,540
<i>We need money for this mamaסי,
this bullshit dagabanza.</i>

395
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:46,383
Oh, very good.

396
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:50,116
Thank you.

397
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,191
Thank you, Mr. Tezo.

398
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:01,825
Hey, doc.

399
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,009
Hey, who's this?

400
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:44,337
Hey, Filk, it's Ray Tierney.

401
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:47,811
Yeah. Hey, can you
check something out for me?

402
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:51,279
That perp who was right inside the door,
the one who had his coat on?

403
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:54,182
Yeah, see if he got processed
that afternoon.

404
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:56,483
Yeah.

405
00:25:56,957 --> 00:25:58,618
Hang on.

406
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,663
It's Lupa. L-U-P-A. Sam...

407
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,924
Son of a bitch.

408
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:10,462
I got water in my bedroom.
Don't ask.

409
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:14,070
Sammy Lupa. Yeah.
It's not on his sheet, but look at the...

410
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,936
Look at those photos. He's got...

411
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,738
He's got no laces in his shoes,
he's got no belt on.

412
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,313
I mean, what does that say to you?

413
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:24,277
Well, that's why I thought so.

414
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,017
All right, let me know.

415
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,921
Yeah. Merry Christmas. Bye.

416
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,091
Shit.

417
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,094
Hey.

418
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:16,395
You weren't gonna knock or anything?

419
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:19,129
Yeah, I wasn't sure...

420
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:23,071
I thought you'd be out, anyway.

421
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:25,769
Figured you were out
doing your last-minute shopping...

422
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:27,777
...tearing around, you know.

423
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:31,748
I found that a while ago.
I've been meaning to give it to you.

424
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,421
Thanks.

425
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:39,115
You gonna go your mom's?

426
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:42,556
- No, they're coming here.
- Oh.

427
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,660
My sister's in town with the kids.

428
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:47,857
Good. Good.

429
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,229
I miss them. Give them my love, okay?

430
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:57,000
You? You going over to your parents'?

431
00:27:57,611 --> 00:27:59,078
No.

432
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,044
We're gonna get everybody
over at Fran and Abby's this year.

433
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:08,748
Just better. You know?

434
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:10,220
How is she?

435
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:13,917
She's the same.

436
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:15,857
Franny, how's he holding up?

437
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,190
He's okay, I guess.

438
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:20,398
He doesn't talk that much about it.

439
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,537
But we had a bad couple days.

440
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:29,772
You heard?

441
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:32,836
Yeah, I heard.

442
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:37,950
I know how close you and Lonnie were,
and I'm really sorry, Ray.

443
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:40,382
Would it have killed you to call me?

444
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,915
- We can't keep doing this.
- Doing what?

445
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:49,187
It's Christmas morning.
You're leaving presents on my stoop. Why?

446
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:50,887
You're my wife for another month.

447
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,761
I can't leave you a Christmas present?
Are we down to that?

448
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:56,232
We have tried and we have tried, Ray.

449
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,200
We went over it and we went over it...

450
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:00,636
...and we keep coming up
against the same wall.

451
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,705
Come on. Come on.

452
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:06,313
No. No. That's not true.

453
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:11,210
- Tash, if you knew how much...
- I know.

454
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:16,017
I feel the same way, Ray.

455
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:22,824
But I'm doing what I have to do.

456
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:26,332
This is what I need to do for me.

457
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,831
Okay.

458
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:41,178
Have a merry Christmas, okay?

459
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:43,873
Yeah, you too. You too.

460
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:47,453
Okay. Okay, okay.

461
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,862
Whole thing's fucked.

462
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,331
Tezo's gone with the wind...

463
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:05,165
...and we're out here doing this shit
on Christmas fucking morning.

464
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:07,830
Hey, fucko, you forget
four of our guys got killed?

465
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:12,676
Tezo was out of control. He was dishing
on the street, dealing his shit.

466
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:16,077
The cocksucker was a fucking liability.

467
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,684
Lived by it, now he's
gonna fucking die by it.

468
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:20,581
Think Casado's any better?

469
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:22,517
Casado knows.

470
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,887
Keep it inside, man,
behind closed doors.

471
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,791
Out of sight, out of mind.
And the fucking envelope's on time.

472
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:31,929
The way it was.

473
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,823
Just the way it was.

474
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:45,234
You gotta keep your head up.
We're not paying the piper on this.

475
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:48,404
There's no way.
We're not going to fucking jail. Okay?

476
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:51,608
Family seeing us behind glass, fuck that.

477
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,318
Fuck that.

478
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,047
Fuck it. Come on.

479
00:30:57,224 --> 00:30:59,784
Let's go pay Pepe a visit.

480
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:25,911
Let me get a couple AA batteries, bro.

481
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:29,288
Angel Tezo. You know him, right?

482
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,219
No, I don't.

483
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:34,321
- Angel Tezo, you know the cocksucker?
- No.

484
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:37,020
- You don't know Angel Tezo?
- No, I don't.

485
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:40,728
- Aah!
- Fucking liar.

486
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,165
Try to be a fucking gentleman.
Get on your knees.

487
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:44,531
Get on your fucking knees!

488
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,229
- Tezo, where is he?
- I don't know.

489
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:50,036
You think I don't know you're running
drugs here for him, you greasy fuck?

490
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,610
- Angel, you work for him? You feel that?
- Yes, I do.

491
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,214
- You do. Where is he?
- I don't know. I don't know.

492
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:59,250
You tell me where he is and you live.
- I don't know. I'm telling you, I don't know.

493
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,354
- I know you're hooked up.
- I don't know.

494
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:02,546
Where?
- I don't know!

495
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:06,181
I'm gonna put a bullet right in your head.
You're gonna die for that shit.

496
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,760
I'm gonna count to three,
then I'm gonna shoot you.

497
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,295
Where the fuck is he? Where is he? One.

498
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:13,763
I swear to God, I don't know!

499
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,595
- Where the fuck is he?
- I don't know!

500
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:16,963
One.
- Eddie!

501
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:18,798
- He knows where he is!
- I don't know!

502
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:23,272
- Eddie. Eddie, he doesn't know where he is.
- He fucking knows! Back off! Two. Three!

503
00:32:24,745 --> 00:32:26,610
- Eddie, what the fuck, bro?
- Ha-ha-ha.

504
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,442
I'm fucking with you, man. See? See?

505
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:30,844
Get up. Get up. Get up.

506
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:33,714
Look at your fucking nose, bro.
What the fuck?

507
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:35,878
Tell you what.
I'm coming back tomorrow.

508
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:38,320
I want you to find out
where that motherfucker is.

509
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:40,960
Hey, we're still friends, right?
We're friends, right?

510
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,152
Let's get out of here.

511
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:45,196
Tomorrow, I'm gonna have bullets
in my gun, though. All right?

512
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:48,198
<i>Clean up your nose, man.
Feliz Navidad, brother.</i>

513
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:49,892
Let's go.

514
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,234
I'm not playing!

515
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:58,404
Think that's right to do that?
- Yep.

516
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:02,071
That is not right to do that, Bailey.
I'll have you...

517
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:05,241
- It is not right to do that.
- I could have you in cuffs.

518
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,219
That's silly. I know what's gonna
happen next, you'll jump me.

519
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:19,023
- How you doing?
- I'm good to go.

520
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,860
You all right?

521
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:25,733
- Last chance to slip out the back.
- Not a chance.

522
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:27,498
All right.

523
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,305
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, that's a good...

524
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:32,001
Bailey.
- Yeah?

525
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,306
You wanna come help Mo-Mo
bake some Christmas cookies?

526
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,539
Uh-huh.

527
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:39,413
Oh, good. We got stars, we got snowmen,
we got Santa Clauses...

528
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:43,750
- If you forfeit the game, you lose.
- I didn't forfeit the game, I won.

529
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:48,588
And for you, mister, we got no more
of this. Come on, give me the drink.

530
00:33:48,762 --> 00:33:50,024
- No, no.
- Give me the drink.

531
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,824
- You've had enough for a while.
- No.

532
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,330
- You've had enough.
- My dear.

533
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,899
I know.

534
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:25,488
What have you done?

535
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,429
You gotta open it up to find out.

536
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:00,360
Is?

537
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,596
Gaelic.

538
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,795
What does it say?

539
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:09,204
<i>It says "Mo Cion Daonnan."</i>

540
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:15,848
- What does that mean?
- It means "My love eternal."

541
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,918
They can go. They can eat them.
- You got it, sweetheart?

542
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:01,258
- Merry Christmas! Hello?
- Hey, Grandma.

543
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,590
Oh, here they come, Mo-Mo.

544
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:05,732
- Look who's here.
- Aunt Megan! Aunt Megan!

545
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,867
Sorry I'm late.
Uncle Jimmy's got presents.

546
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,696
There he is. There's Pop-Pop.

547
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,498
Can we open presents now?
- Merry Christmas. Not yet.

548
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:13,731
Merry Christmas, chief.

549
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,670
- Hey, Ma.
- Merry Christmas.

550
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,367
There's my girl. How are you, buddy?

551
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:19,739
- You get good stuff?
- Yeah.

552
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:22,279
I heard Santa Claus
comes out of the chimney.

553
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,246
Whoa, it's a ball!

554
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:25,885
- What is that?
- What about mine?

555
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,886
No opening, not yet. We don't open yet.

556
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,854
- Oh, look who's here.
- Ma, can we open the presents now?

557
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,459
Yes.
- Yeah, presents!

558
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:36,823
Okay. You can open the presents.

559
00:36:36,997 --> 00:36:39,431
- Hey there.
- Merry Christmas.

560
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,332
Merry Christmas. You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

561
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:46,404
All right, Christmas time. Presents.

562
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:48,768
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
You look beautiful.

563
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:49,966
Thank you so much.

564
00:36:50,143 --> 00:36:52,373
Come on, Dad.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

565
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:54,275
All right, kids. Gifts. Gifts, gifts.

566
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:57,383
- Hi, handsome.
- Hey.

567
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,212
How you doing?

568
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:03,846
- I'm okay, you know.
- Yeah? Did you see her?

569
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:05,955
Yeah, I went by this morning.

570
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,753
And?

571
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:11,320
It's the same.

572
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,924
- Holy smokes.
- One more.

573
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:16,228
Rescue gear.

574
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:19,839
What's going on? Talk to me.
- Nothing. We ain't got shit.

575
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,338
What do you know about Tezo?

576
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:23,840
He's a lowlife dealer.
He operates a couple blocks.

577
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:25,945
So you're telling me we're in the clear?

578
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,673
Franny, I was with Jack Gillick
last week at the range...

579
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:30,612
- He didn't say anything?
- Not a word.

580
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:31,944
Are you sure about that?

581
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,314
My guys were doing something,
I'd know about it.

582
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:37,184
- We gotta get this guy.
- Give me a couple days. Let me ask.

583
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:39,552
- And we'll find out. Trust me.
- All right. Yeah.

584
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:42,593
Come on, we're missing Christmas.
Come on.

585
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,493
All right, who wants ham?

586
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:49,159
I need a knife.
- Hot stuff.

587
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:52,404
Where's?
- Megan, this is...

588
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:55,063
All right.
- There you are.

589
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:57,005
Franny.

590
00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:00,646
- Last but not least.
- Oh, potatoes.

591
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:03,510
They don't want the
Brussels sprouts. That's a little big.

592
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:05,014
So we got sweet potatoes.

593
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,010
Do these kids need any sweet potatoes?

594
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:11,624
- Only Monday of next week.
- Monday?

595
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:15,319
Well, yeah. It wasn't just today, right?
I bring back souvenirs...

596
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:17,588
Didn't that happen with Jimmy Jr?

597
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:20,892
We went to the Poconos.
That was the first time we ever took a trip.

598
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:23,298
I'd like to go on a great vacation.

599
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:25,596
What are you talking about?

600
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:30,974
Wait three years and I'll take you
anywhere you want, sweetie pie.

601
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:40,719
So how you finding being back?

602
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:46,750
Good. I mean, I wish it was a better
circumstance, but we've got a good team.

603
00:38:46,927 --> 00:38:49,589
- Guys treating you all right?
- I worked with these guys.

604
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:51,697
- You remember Chris Miller?
- Yeah, yeah.

605
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:54,060
- I was on some cases with him.
- He's a good guy.

606
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:56,964
Yeah.
- It's just like riding a bicycle.

607
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:59,196
You never forget to ride a bicycle.

608
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:00,498
It's just like him.

609
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:04,542
Look how happy you made the old man.
It's the best Christmas present.

610
00:39:04,711 --> 00:39:09,478
- Caught a lucky break with that kid.
- There's nothing lucky about it.

611
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:12,641
You have the instinct for it.
You have the talent for it.

612
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:15,379
You can see everything
when they're kids.

613
00:39:15,555 --> 00:39:17,455
I could see him when he was a kid.
- Mm-hm.

614
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:21,525
He was the brains. He was the thinker.

615
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,458
He solved problems.

616
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,259
And that's what he does now as an adult,
he solves problems.

617
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,459
And he was always a leader.

618
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,865
He was a leader of men,
and people listened to Franny.

619
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,670
He has a personality.

620
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:41,304
He's gonna be a full inspector
before you know it, Abby.

621
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:45,144
And then there's my little baby girl there.

622
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:48,818
And she was always just
the way she is right now.

623
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:51,822
She had a heart
as big as the whole world.

624
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:54,718
As big as the whole world.

625
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:59,389
And that's why... That's what she is now.
That's why she's a nurse.

626
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,431
My kids.

627
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:07,834
That's my kids.
Most important thing in the world.

628
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:11,466
That's a pretty high bar we set,
me and Mo-Mo, huh?

629
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:13,078
Pretty high bar we set.

630
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:16,107
You're okay, old man.

631
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:19,078
You're not bad yourself.

632
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:37,728
Shit.

633
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,700
Lisette.

634
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,811
Fuck, man! I fucking...

635
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,091
10-13, 10-13...

636
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:16,337
Okay, this is what we got.

637
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:18,374
Number one's got a bullet in the head.

638
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:21,036
You're looking at an exit wound.
Went out the window.

639
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:25,048
Number two put his arm up, bullet went
through the arm and into the head.

640
00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:28,585
Number three back here, he's been here
a couple days. He's a little ripe.

641
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:30,450
Took one to the back of the head.

642
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,253
And we don't really know
where the fuck he fits in just yet.

643
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:46,829
We're thinking that's the way he took off,
through that fucking window.

644
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:50,273
You wanna see the witness?

645
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:51,840
- Yeah.
- Look at me.

646
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,173
She's back here.
- Hey, Lisette.

647
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:56,611
Now, fuck this
you-don't-understand-me bullshit.

648
00:41:56,783 --> 00:41:58,444
Steve.

649
00:42:00,153 --> 00:42:03,020
Want you to meet Ray Tierney
from the task force.

650
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:05,123
- Hey, Ray.
- Hey. Ray.

651
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:07,021
How you doing?

652
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,127
So, what do you got?

653
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:10,627
Well, she's pretty scattered.

654
00:42:10,797 --> 00:42:13,664
About half a gram of coke, some hypos,
two decks of heroin...

655
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:15,232
...you know, out of her purse.

656
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,427
- Why he didn't just waste her...
- Yeah.

657
00:42:17,604 --> 00:42:18,628
What'd she say?

658
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:21,831
Nothing I can understand.
It's all ghetto shit.

659
00:42:22,008 --> 00:42:23,475
- Can I have a few minutes?
- Yeah.

660
00:42:23,643 --> 00:42:25,611
- Get a crack at it?
- Yeah, sure.

661
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,345
Lisette.

662
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:07,346
Is that your little girl?

663
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:12,619
You're gonna lose her.
We're gonna bust you for possession.

664
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:15,056
Child Services is gonna
take her away from you.

665
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:18,493
Is that what you want to happen?
Is that what you want?

666
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:20,760
Wait a minute, what is that?

667
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:24,067
What's this? What is this?

668
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:29,738
What happened there?

669
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:32,267
He do that to you?
Did Tezo do that to you?

670
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:36,548
Did he, Lisette?
Did he put that gun to your head?

671
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:42,815
What happened?

672
00:43:56,569 --> 00:43:59,834
- Has anybody looked at her?
- There's a bus on its way.

673
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:03,965
Okay. Look, I wanna help you, okay?

674
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:06,271
But you gotta give me something.

675
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:12,317
I know you got something.
Give me something.

676
00:44:16,256 --> 00:44:17,655
Who?

677
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:20,122
Sandy.

678
00:44:24,297 --> 00:44:26,527
Sandy helped him escape. Who's Sandy?

679
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:43,939
What?

680
00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:51,988
She talking about us?
- No. Shh. Shh.

681
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:56,929
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

682
00:44:58,731 --> 00:45:00,062
<i>Sandy's policםa?</i>

683
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,793
Tezo's friend's a cop?

684
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,703
If you're lying to me...

685
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:14,608
...I'm gonna take your fucking kid
away from you.

686
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,209
She's bugging out.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

687
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:22,650
I tell you what, do me a favor.

688
00:45:22,822 --> 00:45:25,882
Hold on to her till she gets straight.
I'll meet you at the house.

689
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,583
- All right.
- Nobody talks to her.

690
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,784
- All right.
- Okay?

691
00:45:28,962 --> 00:45:31,260
- I'll handle it.
- Thanks.

692
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:20,206
Why does a man choose
to be a police officer?

693
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,044
What kind of man gets up in the morning,
showers, shaves, and goes to work...

694
00:46:25,218 --> 00:46:28,984
...not knowing whether he'll be alive
at the end of the day?

695
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:34,422
What kind of man has the courage
to stand at the door of the temple...

696
00:46:34,594 --> 00:46:40,032
...and say to those who seek to corrupt,
rob and harm our citizens:

697
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:44,693
"Not on my watch.
You will not harm one of mine"?

698
00:46:45,538 --> 00:46:47,904
Lonnie Mercer was that kind of man.

699
00:46:48,908 --> 00:46:51,274
As we commit his body to the earth...

700
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:54,709
...we ask God to take Lonnie's soul
into everlasting light.

701
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:58,643
May his soul rest in peace.

702
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:00,683
Amen.

703
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:09,093
Present arms.

704
00:47:42,495 --> 00:47:43,962
Hey.

705
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,722
Franny.

706
00:47:46,899 --> 00:47:48,628
Hey, Ray.
- Hey.

707
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:52,203
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

708
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:54,431
- Hey, you did good.
- You think so?

709
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:56,199
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

710
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,071
Yeah.

711
00:47:58,611 --> 00:47:59,908
Wanna get a cup of coffee?

712
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,106
I gotta go home and see Abby and the kids.
Wanna spend the day with them, you know?

713
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:07,446
Sure, yeah. Listen, I gotta talk to you
about some things.

714
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,554
Okay. What's up?

715
00:48:10,323 --> 00:48:14,521
You and Jimmy coming up with anything
about why your guys were in that building?

716
00:48:14,994 --> 00:48:17,053
No, Ray. They were just
being cops, you know?

717
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:21,698
Are you sure your guys didn't run
a plant-and-bust on Tezo that day?

718
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:25,066
It feels like they popped that guy
on nickel-and-dime shit...

719
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:27,229
...so they could use him on a door knock.

720
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:31,009
I know these SNEU guys.
They'll go around a warrant doing that.

721
00:48:31,177 --> 00:48:33,202
I need to know
if you were giving them that.

722
00:48:33,379 --> 00:48:36,246
Wait a minute. What are you saying?
Did I miss something here?

723
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:39,681
Did you already catch the scumbag
that killed four of my guys? Did you?

724
00:48:39,852 --> 00:48:41,080
Listen to me. Listen.

725
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:45,088
We found a cell phone outside
of that apartment. It was Tezo's.

726
00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:48,193
We dumped it. Somebody called him
right before our guys went in.

727
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:51,696
Now, I checked it against the trace
on that 911 call.

728
00:48:51,864 --> 00:48:54,196
It's the same number, Fran.

729
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:58,533
And you know where the call came from?
It came from Coney Island.

730
00:48:59,772 --> 00:49:02,570
How are shots fired in Washington Heights
heard in Brooklyn?

731
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:04,733
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Tell me that.

732
00:49:04,911 --> 00:49:07,709
Half your guys were at that
football game, okay?

733
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,576
If you were gonna pull a sting,
that would be a good time.

734
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,981
Look, I'm not trying to put you on the spot.
I'm helping. I'm trying...

735
00:49:14,153 --> 00:49:16,713
Do you wanna help me?
Do you wanna fucking help me?

736
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:19,153
You find that scumbag
that killed four of my guys.

737
00:49:19,325 --> 00:49:21,088
Yeah. Hey, hey, that's what I'm doing.

738
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,855
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I talked to this broad Lisette.

739
00:49:25,164 --> 00:49:29,396
She says that a friend of his called him
and tipped him that our guys were coming.

740
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,406
<i>She says it was a cop, Franny.
She said, "La policםa."</i>

741
00:49:34,574 --> 00:49:37,202
She said it was someone named Sandy.

742
00:49:37,376 --> 00:49:40,345
You got any cops in your precinct
named Sandy?

743
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:41,844
No.

744
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:43,372
No nicknames, nothing?

745
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:46,814
- I said I don't know anyone named Sandy.
- Okay, okay, listen.

746
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:49,284
I have not shared this around, Franny.

747
00:49:49,455 --> 00:49:53,448
It is not gonna take peerless detective work
for someone else to connect these dots.

748
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:55,685
I know you're trying to protect your guys...

749
00:49:55,862 --> 00:50:00,060
...but you gotta get...
- Protect? Protect? They're gone, Raymond.

750
00:50:00,399 --> 00:50:04,199
Freddie, Jack, Billy, Lonnie.
They're all dead.

751
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,770
What the fuck do I gotta
protect them from now, huh?

752
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:11,275
Fran. I'm trying to protect you.

753
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:16,011
You know, these questions are gonna come,
Fran. We gotta start dealing with it.

754
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:21,911
Find fucking Tezo, Ray,
all right? Do me a favor.

755
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:34,666
Anybody in?

756
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:36,301
Yeah.

757
00:50:40,573 --> 00:50:42,939
- Hey.
- Hey.

758
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:44,667
Come on in.

759
00:50:47,146 --> 00:50:48,773
What happened?

760
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:53,980
My carpet. What happened to the carpet?

761
00:50:54,654 --> 00:50:58,317
You're supposed to fix the leaks before you
put the carpet down, Pop. You know that?

762
00:50:58,491 --> 00:50:59,753
Oh...

763
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:03,922
Boats leak, Raymond.
It's the nature of things.

764
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:07,630
Close the door, will you?

765
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:15,263
There you go.

766
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:19,834
- Have a few nips this evening, Pop?
- Had a glass of Scotch, officer.

767
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:21,104
Just one, huh?

768
00:51:21,848 --> 00:51:23,475
I used the same glass, yeah.

769
00:51:25,151 --> 00:51:27,312
Let me put on a pot of coffee.

770
00:51:30,256 --> 00:51:32,383
Oh, boy.

771
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:36,127
Got some memories in this tub.

772
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:38,195
Here. Drink that.

773
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:42,100
It's nice and warm.

774
00:51:44,904 --> 00:51:46,997
Your brother called me.

775
00:51:48,107 --> 00:51:49,802
Oh, yeah? Did he get something?

776
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:52,501
Ears to the ground,
but they're getting blanked.

777
00:51:54,547 --> 00:51:56,276
He said you came at him a little bit.

778
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:00,977
Asking about his boys,
how they were operating.

779
00:52:01,153 --> 00:52:03,986
I ran up against some shit
didn't feel right.

780
00:52:04,857 --> 00:52:07,553
I went to see if Franny and Jimmy
could clear it up for me.

781
00:52:07,727 --> 00:52:11,026
But it didn't file?
You didn't put it down in the fives?

782
00:52:11,197 --> 00:52:13,665
No, I didn't put it in the fives yet.

783
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,300
But some of it, Pop, I gotta.

784
00:52:15,468 --> 00:52:18,301
Raymond, you got
something case-pertinent...

785
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:22,066
...help us catch this cocksucker,
by all means, share.

786
00:52:22,241 --> 00:52:24,072
But you start looking for loose ends...

787
00:52:24,243 --> 00:52:27,644
...where your brother's boys
are concerned, where's that gonna fall?

788
00:52:27,813 --> 00:52:30,941
You think I'm not thinking about that?
This isn't loose ends.

789
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:34,982
Pop, I got the shooter's girl saying...

790
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:38,279
Saying that he got tipped off.

791
00:52:38,457 --> 00:52:40,721
And she says it was a cop
that made the call.

792
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:47,963
Are you telling me
we're gonna suppress that?

793
00:52:48,234 --> 00:52:50,031
Not suppress, Raymond.

794
00:52:50,202 --> 00:52:53,433
Sit on, for the moment,
anything that might go sideways on us.

795
00:52:53,606 --> 00:52:55,130
Oh, come on. It's the same thing.

796
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:57,674
You know what position
that's gonna put me in?

797
00:52:57,843 --> 00:53:00,107
Raymond, eight years
as a Major Case narc...

798
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:03,737
...and you never let something settle
before you put it in print?

799
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:06,885
Made sure it wasn't gonna come back,
bite you, jam you up?

800
00:53:07,053 --> 00:53:09,578
I'm not looking to jam anybody up,
not intentionally.

801
00:53:09,755 --> 00:53:11,882
Intentionally, unintentionally.
Doesn't matter.

802
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:15,050
Anything that makes cops look culpable
is no good, Raymond.

803
00:53:17,797 --> 00:53:19,389
What do you want me to do with it?

804
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:22,431
- You want me to spell it out for you?
- Yeah.

805
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:26,731
Stay on point. Keep your focus
on finding the fuck who killed our guys.

806
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:29,238
And if you find anything else
that seems off...

807
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:33,435
...you come to me
and we deal with it. Okay?

808
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:35,580
If you say so.

809
00:53:38,484 --> 00:53:40,418
I say so.

810
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:43,582
Okay.

811
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:53,330
- Hey, Lou, you still here?
- Yes, boss.

812
00:53:53,499 --> 00:53:56,468
No one goes downstairs.
- You got it, boss.

813
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:08,176
Hey, Sandy.

814
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:14,080
Hey, boss.
What are you doing here this late?

815
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:17,683
Come here.

816
00:54:23,462 --> 00:54:26,124
Hey, guys. Clear it out.

817
00:54:26,565 --> 00:54:29,728
Zach, take it upstairs.

818
00:54:36,942 --> 00:54:38,409
What's up?

819
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,104
I'm gonna ask you this one time, Sandy.

820
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:43,873
Okay.

821
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:47,752
And if your first impulse is to lie,
you better fucking resist like hell.

822
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,945
Boss, what are you talking about?

823
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,148
Angel Tezo.

824
00:54:54,894 --> 00:54:56,384
Yeah?

825
00:54:57,496 --> 00:55:00,363
This girl they hauled in
up in the Bronx, Lisette Rivera...

826
00:55:01,901 --> 00:55:03,960
...she was the last one with him.

827
00:55:04,336 --> 00:55:08,067
She said a cop tipped Tezo off
to the Washington Heights raid.

828
00:55:08,707 --> 00:55:11,403
She said this cop
went by the name Sandy.

829
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:14,840
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

830
00:55:15,714 --> 00:55:17,477
Well, shit, I don't know no...

831
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:18,810
You set them up to die?

832
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:20,383
- Your own men!
- I didn't know.

833
00:55:20,553 --> 00:55:24,421
- You let them walk into that?
- I didn't know! Jesus Christ, cap, please.

834
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:28,219
He was... I've known him since we
were kids. He was my ex-wife's cousin.

835
00:55:28,394 --> 00:55:30,123
You fucking piece of shit!

836
00:55:30,296 --> 00:55:33,754
I told him to get out, they were coming.
I didn't know he'd stay.

837
00:55:33,933 --> 00:55:35,127
You didn't know he'd stay?

838
00:55:35,301 --> 00:55:37,531
I swear, I didn't know
it would end up like that!

839
00:55:37,703 --> 00:55:39,534
What did you think would happen, Sandy?

840
00:55:39,705 --> 00:55:42,936
They were going in there to kill him.
Egan said for them to kill him.

841
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:44,667
What...? What?

842
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:46,709
Jimmy? Jimmy Egan said what?

843
00:55:46,879 --> 00:55:49,404
He wanted Tezo dead.
He sent them in there to do him...

844
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:50,640
...take his money.

845
00:55:50,816 --> 00:55:53,842
Are you fucking telling me Jimmy Egan
was going after drug money?

846
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:58,183
Kill Tezo, steal his shit,
get into business with Casado.

847
00:55:58,357 --> 00:56:00,416
That was the deal.

848
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,697
You're telling me the fucking SNEU team
was going after drug dealers?

849
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:14,636
That Jimmy Egan was fucking putting hits
out on people for fucking money?

850
00:56:14,807 --> 00:56:17,105
- That's what you were doing on the street?
- Yeah.

851
00:56:17,276 --> 00:56:19,870
And you dealt with that
by setting up your own crew?

852
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:21,842
By sending them into a fucking ambush?

853
00:56:22,014 --> 00:56:24,915
You don't call me?
You don't fucking come to me, Sandy?

854
00:56:25,084 --> 00:56:28,110
- I'm your fucking CO!
- I didn't know they'd die.

855
00:56:28,287 --> 00:56:32,018
And I thought you knew.
Everybody knew.

856
00:56:40,232 --> 00:56:42,200
Hey, get out of here.

857
00:56:42,368 --> 00:56:44,131
Get the fuck out of here!

858
00:56:55,314 --> 00:56:57,612
You're done. Tonight.

859
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,580
Turn in your gun, shield, ID card.

860
00:57:00,753 --> 00:57:04,780
And if I see you around here, Sandy,
I will shit-can your pension for good.

861
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:07,119
This is all I got.

862
00:57:09,195 --> 00:57:11,459
Well, you don't got this anymore.

863
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,767
Fuck!

864
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:05,910
Aah! Whoo!

865
00:59:08,314 --> 00:59:09,508
Ready?
- Yeah.

866
00:59:09,682 --> 00:59:10,706
Four.
- Hut-hut.

867
00:59:10,883 --> 00:59:12,043
Hike.

868
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:16,820
There's nothing wrong with...

869
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:19,048
That means we're gonna have,
what, four kids?

870
00:59:19,224 --> 00:59:22,125
Four kids? I can't afford that shit.
Four kids?

871
00:59:22,294 --> 00:59:23,886
This one.

872
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:25,488
You think that's fun?

873
00:59:25,664 --> 00:59:28,394
It's definitely time for hot chocolate
and marshmallows.

874
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:29,898
Do you have ice in your boot?

875
00:59:32,471 --> 00:59:35,463
Okay. There we go, baby. Whoo!

876
00:59:36,342 --> 00:59:38,902
- All right, honey, boots.
- Okay.

877
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:41,007
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, I'm sorry, pumpkin.

878
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,511
- I'm okay.
Okay.

879
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:47,615
Oh, who's that?
Who is that? Let's go get the door.

880
00:59:51,123 --> 00:59:52,920
What's up, guy?

881
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:55,618
Hi there.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Egan.

882
00:59:55,794 --> 00:59:57,421
Is Jimmy home?

883
00:59:57,596 --> 00:59:58,961
Yeah. I'm sorry, who are you?

884
00:59:59,131 --> 01:00:01,656
- I'm a old friend of his.
- You're an old friend of his?

885
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:04,803
Baby, I got it. Jimmy, come here.
Come here. Get inside.

886
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:08,406
- Get some hot chocolate. I got it.
- He's an old friend.

887
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:12,635
What the fuck you doing here,
Casado? Get around back. Now.

888
01:00:14,446 --> 01:00:16,175
Who's that, baby?

889
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:18,316
Nobody. He's out of here in five minutes.

890
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:21,647
- Where do you know him from?
- From work. He shouldn't be here.

891
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,549
So why is he here?

892
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:25,183
I'm gonna get rid of him.

893
01:00:25,357 --> 01:00:27,587
Kiss for me? Rah!

894
01:00:28,093 --> 01:00:30,425
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too.

895
01:00:30,696 --> 01:00:32,288
You too, Mommy.

896
01:00:32,765 --> 01:00:34,630
Do you have any juice?

897
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,325
Jimmy, Franny's called you
like a thousand times today.

898
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,904
- You gonna call him back or what?
- Yeah, Bobby's going on vacation.

899
01:00:42,074 --> 01:00:45,271
Probably wants me to cover.
I'll talk to him tonight.

900
01:00:53,252 --> 01:00:55,516
You know how many cops
I got as neighbors, moron?

901
01:00:55,687 --> 01:00:56,847
I figured that.

902
01:00:57,022 --> 01:00:59,081
What got into your head,
you come to my home?

903
01:00:59,258 --> 01:01:03,354
Well, I call you on your jack
and it's disconnected.

904
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:07,056
You could have caught a tail. They could
have eyes and ears on us right now.

905
01:01:07,232 --> 01:01:10,292
Better slow down how you talking to me.
I'll smack fire out you.

906
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:12,596
And I don't give a fuck
if you a cop or no cop.

907
01:01:12,771 --> 01:01:14,966
- Understand me?
- Listen, you fucking cocksucker.

908
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,598
I don't care how much jack you think
you got, who's backing your play.

909
01:01:18,777 --> 01:01:22,372
You come to my house, you try to
press me in front of my kids, my wife...

910
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,516
...it's a fucking mistake.

911
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:28,551
- Yeah, laugh, you fucking scumbag.
- You hard as fuck, Jimmy, wow.

912
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:32,345
But you slipping, J. You slipping.

913
01:01:32,524 --> 01:01:35,982
- Why is this motherfucker still breathing?
- We on a buzzer beater with you?

914
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:38,152
- Is this a clock?
- Might as well be.

915
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:42,130
I give you money,
and this shit ain't handled?

916
01:01:42,301 --> 01:01:45,202
You fucking with old boy,
you should be fucking with me, Jimmy.

917
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:48,601
- What's the problem? What's the problem?
- You glance at a TV lately?

918
01:01:48,774 --> 01:01:49,900
- Yeah.
- What'd you see?

919
01:01:50,075 --> 01:01:53,977
Your boys been getting blasted lately,
but I don't give a shit about that.

920
01:01:54,146 --> 01:01:57,707
I just wanna know, are we straight?
Are we straight, Jimmy?

921
01:01:57,883 --> 01:01:59,248
Did I make the arrangement?

922
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:02,020
- Did I take the money?
- You took the money.

923
01:02:02,187 --> 01:02:04,155
- What does that say?
- That don't say shit...

924
01:02:04,323 --> 01:02:07,019
Listen to me. Listen.
Do not fucking shout in my doghouse.

925
01:02:07,192 --> 01:02:09,353
- You need to slow the fuck down.
- Listen.

926
01:02:09,528 --> 01:02:12,463
- Listen to me, you motherfucker. Listen up.
- What you gonna say?

927
01:02:12,631 --> 01:02:14,758
When he's dead, it's done.

928
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,963
If I see you come around here again...

929
01:02:17,135 --> 01:02:20,263
...anywhere near my house,
anywhere near my fucking family...

930
01:02:20,439 --> 01:02:25,103
...if you even mention a word about my
kids and my wife again, I will kill you.

931
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:29,005
Stop. Give me that.

932
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:40,288
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- You fucked up, Jimmy. You fucked up.

933
01:02:42,494 --> 01:02:46,453
Get that fucking dirty-ass fucking
monkey language out of my fucking yard.

934
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:49,692
Get that fucking monkey language out of
my fucking yard.

935
01:02:55,607 --> 01:02:57,336
Don't. Give me it.

936
01:02:57,509 --> 01:02:59,943
Say goodbye to the family for me, okay?

937
01:03:40,819 --> 01:03:42,616
Kenny.

938
01:03:42,988 --> 01:03:45,115
I'm in here, baby.

939
01:03:46,091 --> 01:03:49,151
Yeah, okay. Hold on.

940
01:03:53,398 --> 01:03:55,366
Okay. I'll be right there.

941
01:03:55,534 --> 01:03:57,968
<i>- Hey, Jimmy, what's up?
Where the fuck is everybody?</i>

942
01:03:58,136 --> 01:04:00,627
<i>Calling Eddie, Sandy.
No one's picking up.</i>

943
01:04:00,806 --> 01:04:03,570
Eddie's sleeping off Christmas.
I don't know where Sandy is.

944
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:08,202
<i>I got some intel from a guy in Heida.
You remember Coco Dominguez?</i>

945
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:12,908
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tezo's lieutenant.
- Yeah, Tezo's lieutenant. He fucked up.</i>

946
01:04:13,085 --> 01:04:16,612
<i>Back in town from the D.R.
He came in to see his kids for the holidays.</i>

947
01:04:16,788 --> 01:04:19,018
<i>He's not gonna give him up.</i>

948
01:04:19,191 --> 01:04:20,783
<i>No way Coco's gonna talk, Jimmy.</i>

949
01:04:24,129 --> 01:04:25,858
Hey, Coco.

950
01:04:29,568 --> 01:04:31,297
- Where is he?
- Get down. Get the kids down.

951
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,870
- He gone, you motherfucker. Gone.
- Gone where, Coco?

952
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:37,634
Gone, nigga. Now, do your fucking job
and find him, motherfucker.

953
01:04:46,284 --> 01:04:49,720
If you let me get out of this shit,
I'm gonna come back and stab you... Aah!

954
01:04:50,322 --> 01:04:53,758
- Deranged motherfucker.
- You're gonna tell me where he is.

955
01:04:53,925 --> 01:04:56,393
- You're gonna tell me.
- I'll tell you where he is.

956
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:59,052
I'll tell you.
He's up your mama's ass, bitch!

957
01:04:59,231 --> 01:05:01,290
Please.
- Angelique, put the boy back!

958
01:05:01,466 --> 01:05:04,333
Angelique, put the boy back in!
Push that nigga back!

959
01:05:04,503 --> 01:05:08,166
Angelique, get the boy back in the room
now! Push that nigga back, Angelique!

960
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:10,934
Angelique, get the boy back in!
Put the baby back in!

961
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:13,202
- Put the baby back in the room!
- Ugh!

962
01:05:15,847 --> 01:05:19,078
Shut up. Do you understand me?
You speak English?

963
01:05:19,251 --> 01:05:23,312
Shut up! Shut your fucking...
Shut your mouth. Shut it.

964
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:29,120
Still up my mother's ass? Huh?

965
01:05:30,529 --> 01:05:32,190
Talk to me.

966
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:37,030
Kenny, put in a call to ACS.

967
01:05:37,803 --> 01:05:41,466
Tell them they gotta take an infant.
First-degree burns over most of its body.

968
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,269
- Tell them the baby's face is disfigured.
- Sure thing, Jimmy.

969
01:05:46,344 --> 01:05:48,403
<i>Use your phone, muchacho? Hm?</i>

970
01:05:58,256 --> 01:05:59,348
Angel Tezo.

971
01:06:00,759 --> 01:06:03,956
Fuck you, Jimmy. Kiss my fucking ass.

972
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,900
Wait, wait! He's up in Morrisania
in the Bronx at the bitch's place.

973
01:06:11,069 --> 01:06:13,833
- Where? Where? You talk to him?
- At his bitch's place.

974
01:06:14,005 --> 01:06:15,302
- Who? Who?
- Esther, Esther!

975
01:06:15,474 --> 01:06:19,911
Esther fucking what?
You better fucking tell me! Esther what?

976
01:06:20,078 --> 01:06:21,238
You tell him where he is!

977
01:06:21,413 --> 01:06:23,643
- Esther fucking what?
- Kane. Kane, nigga! Kane!

978
01:06:23,815 --> 01:06:28,309
Esther-motherfucking-Kane, nigga!
Now, put the baby down, nigga!

979
01:06:32,624 --> 01:06:34,285
Please.
- Come here. You're okay.

980
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:37,053
Oh, no! Please, please, officer.

981
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:45,260
- Oh, God.
- He's beautiful.

982
01:06:55,347 --> 01:06:58,339
You breathe a word of this,
and I come back here.

983
01:06:59,785 --> 01:07:03,619
I'll slit your throat, fuck your wife
and kill your kid.

984
01:07:03,855 --> 01:07:05,413
Look at me.

985
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:08,684
You tip Angel off,
I'll make it even worse.

986
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,657
I'll send an ambulance over.

987
01:07:46,665 --> 01:07:48,496
Oh, shit.

988
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:50,828
Go, go, go!

989
01:07:58,476 --> 01:07:59,841
Hey, Took.

990
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:02,775
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, come on. Leave me alone, bro!

991
01:08:02,948 --> 01:08:05,416
- Come on, Took.
- I didn't do nothing.

992
01:08:06,384 --> 01:08:08,682
- Where you going?
- Leave me alone, yo!

993
01:08:08,854 --> 01:08:10,913
Come here, dipshit. Come here.
- Come on.

994
01:08:11,089 --> 01:08:13,853
You run on me? You running
from me? Get up against the wall.

995
01:08:14,025 --> 01:08:15,287
- All right!
- Shut up.

996
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,087
- All right.
- You got a demo in here?

997
01:08:17,262 --> 01:08:20,026
- If I cut my hand, I'm gonna get...
- In my pocket. My pocket.

998
01:08:20,198 --> 01:08:23,395
- What pocket?
- The other pocket, bro. The other one.

999
01:08:23,568 --> 01:08:27,060
You been smoking too much of this
devil's shit. It's messing with your mind.

1000
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:29,503
Your friend come to check up on you,
you bug out?

1001
01:08:29,674 --> 01:08:32,006
I haven't seen you in a long time.
What you expect?

1002
01:08:32,177 --> 01:08:35,044
I just came to talk.
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?

1003
01:08:35,213 --> 01:08:37,613
- You chill? You gonna chill out?
- I'm chill, B.

1004
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:40,512
- Okay, you don't look chill.
- I'm chill, yo. I'm chill.

1005
01:08:40,685 --> 01:08:42,380
What you expect, bro?
You scared me, man.

1006
01:08:42,554 --> 01:08:45,580
Whoa! What is this, the fucking airport?
Give it over. Give it.

1007
01:08:45,757 --> 01:08:48,021
What do you want from me?
- You know how it works.

1008
01:08:48,193 --> 01:08:50,627
Come on. We help each other out,
just like old times.

1009
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:51,819
- Okay?
- Why?

1010
01:08:51,997 --> 01:08:54,397
Give me some good skank,
I'll give you your cook-up.

1011
01:08:54,566 --> 01:08:56,295
- What?
- Okay? I want Angel Tezo.

1012
01:08:56,468 --> 01:08:59,130
You and every other cop in the city's
asking that shit, B.

1013
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:02,364
- I don't know shit, B.
- Oh, yeah? You weren't steering for him?

1014
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,008
Getting cracked out with his cousin?
Don't shine me.

1015
01:09:05,176 --> 01:09:08,976
I swear on everything I love, yo.
He'll smoke me if I talk to you, yo. Chill.

1016
01:09:09,147 --> 01:09:12,275
If I pop you for this, you're dodging
dicks in Rikers before Friday.

1017
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:13,610
- Come on.
- Take your pick.

1018
01:09:13,785 --> 01:09:15,309
- Give me my shit.
- Want your shit?

1019
01:09:15,487 --> 01:09:17,614
- I pick my shit. Come on.
- Want your shit?

1020
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:19,256
No, stop.
- There's your shit.

1021
01:09:19,424 --> 01:09:22,052
Stop playing, Tierney! Man!
Tierney, come on, yo.

1022
01:09:22,227 --> 01:09:24,320
- What is this, a charity I'm running?
- No, no.

1023
01:09:24,496 --> 01:09:26,828
We're here to trade.
You gotta sell me something.

1024
01:09:26,998 --> 01:09:29,523
- Nothing?
- No, no, no!

1025
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:31,464
- No!
- Too bad. Last one.

1026
01:09:31,636 --> 01:09:33,695
- Stop playing. Chill. No.
- A little bit.

1027
01:09:33,872 --> 01:09:35,533
- Come on, please.
- What do you think?

1028
01:09:35,707 --> 01:09:37,800
- What do you think? Got something?
- All right.

1029
01:09:37,976 --> 01:09:39,807
Where's he at? Who's helping him?

1030
01:09:39,978 --> 01:09:42,742
No, Ray, no, no, last one. All right.
All right. All right.

1031
01:09:48,486 --> 01:09:52,081
Miller, I got a line on Tezo.
I got a line on Tezo. Send backup.

1032
01:09:52,257 --> 01:09:56,353
I'm on my way there right now.
433 Central Avenue, Morrisania.

1033
01:09:56,528 --> 01:09:59,827
Yeah, no, I know. I know,
but we missed it. We missed it, okay?

1034
01:09:59,998 --> 01:10:03,456
Just... I'll see you there.
I'll explain it there.

1035
01:10:11,476 --> 01:10:13,171
Come on.

1036
01:11:36,294 --> 01:11:38,819
Audubon 6 to Central,
I got shots fired. Shots fired.

1037
01:11:38,997 --> 01:11:42,262
433 Central Avenue in the Bronx.
I need backup.

1038
01:11:49,174 --> 01:11:52,143
I'm going in. I need backup forthwith.

1039
01:12:20,271 --> 01:12:22,000
Shit.

1040
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,953
Go away.

1041
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:48,927
Get him up, man!

1042
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,728
Pig! Get the fuck off me!

1043
01:12:53,705 --> 01:12:54,967
Fuck you!

1044
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:05,172
Open his fucking mouth.

1045
01:13:13,491 --> 01:13:15,356
Give me something.

1046
01:13:16,761 --> 01:13:17,785
Give me something.

1047
01:13:17,962 --> 01:13:19,020
Fucking answer.

1048
01:13:21,799 --> 01:13:24,097
I want a fucking name.

1049
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:29,997
Sandy.

1050
01:13:30,175 --> 01:13:31,938
Finish him.

1051
01:13:33,378 --> 01:13:34,504
Jimmy.

1052
01:13:35,346 --> 01:13:36,711
Hey, no, no! It's Ray!

1053
01:13:36,881 --> 01:13:40,009
- Ray? Ray, we got him.
- Jimmy, what the fuck is going on here?

1054
01:13:40,185 --> 01:13:41,209
- We got him.
- What?

1055
01:13:41,386 --> 01:13:43,786
- We got him.
- What are you guys even doing here?

1056
01:13:43,955 --> 01:13:45,479
- What is he...?
- It's handled, Ray.

1057
01:13:45,657 --> 01:13:48,217
What do you mean, it's handled?
What are you...? Come on!

1058
01:13:48,393 --> 01:13:50,122
Hey. Enough. Enough.

1059
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:51,819
- Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1060
01:13:51,996 --> 01:13:53,759
- Don't fucking take it out!
- Hey, hey.

1061
01:13:53,932 --> 01:13:55,456
- Motherfucker.
- Don't take it out.

1062
01:13:55,633 --> 01:13:58,033
- Take your hands off of me.
- Ray, put the gun away.

1063
01:13:58,203 --> 01:14:00,103
Put your hand on me again, asshole.

1064
01:14:05,343 --> 01:14:07,072
Oh, my God.

1065
01:14:07,245 --> 01:14:10,840
- Fuck him, he's done.
- He's not done. He's alive.

1066
01:14:13,718 --> 01:14:15,447
Jesus.

1067
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:18,252
Jesus.

1068
01:14:22,827 --> 01:14:24,317
He's dead.

1069
01:14:25,496 --> 01:14:26,520
Jimmy.

1070
01:14:28,766 --> 01:14:30,859
Good work, Ray.

1071
01:14:31,336 --> 01:14:33,031
Good work.

1072
01:14:39,877 --> 01:14:43,438
You motherfucker! You motherfucker!
What the fuck are you thinking?

1073
01:14:43,615 --> 01:14:45,344
- Get back.
- Have you lost your mind?

1074
01:14:45,516 --> 01:14:46,983
Ray.

1075
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,786
I fucking love you, Ray.
You know I do. You're family.

1076
01:14:54,993 --> 01:14:56,893
Your backup's coming.

1077
01:14:57,195 --> 01:14:58,890
So here's what happened.

1078
01:14:59,063 --> 01:15:01,930
Now, you got here first. He resisted.

1079
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,827
You had to put three in him.

1080
01:15:05,803 --> 01:15:07,065
It was a clean shoot.

1081
01:15:08,306 --> 01:15:11,867
- You have lost your fucking mind.
- You're a cop, Ray.

1082
01:15:12,143 --> 01:15:13,474
Just like us.

1083
01:15:13,945 --> 01:15:16,038
You're a fucking cop.

1084
01:15:18,116 --> 01:15:22,177
- Get your fucking hands off me. Get off me.
- Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

1085
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:24,718
He knows what he's
gotta do here, right, Jimmy?

1086
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:27,490
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

1087
01:15:43,641 --> 01:15:45,939
You talk to him?
- No. Look, Ray...

1088
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:49,944
- What are you doing here? Talk to him.
- Calm down. We're gonna figure this out.

1089
01:15:50,114 --> 01:15:53,379
Was there static on the line?
Did you hear what I fucking said?

1090
01:15:53,551 --> 01:15:58,181
Jimmy executed him. He took my fucking
gun off me, Francis, and shot him.

1091
01:15:58,356 --> 01:16:01,052
What the fuck is going on here?
Did you send him in there?

1092
01:16:01,225 --> 01:16:04,388
- What did you know? Were you in on this?
- No, I didn't know, Ray.

1093
01:16:04,562 --> 01:16:05,722
You didn't know like
you didn't know about Sandy?

1094
01:16:07,786 --> 01:16:11,813
I come to you and I asked you if you had
a cop in your precinct named Sandy.

1095
01:16:11,991 --> 01:16:14,482
A nickname, I said.
Tell me you weren't lying to me.

1096
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,527
I needed to find out for myself.
You've been gone a long time.

1097
01:16:17,696 --> 01:16:20,631
Come on.
I came to you to try to help you.

1098
01:16:20,799 --> 01:16:24,758
Do you have any idea what Jimmy's been
doing under your roof? Do you even care?

1099
01:16:24,937 --> 01:16:26,268
I'm doing my best. All right?

1100
01:16:26,438 --> 01:16:30,135
I'm in the hospital all day with my wife,
who's fucking dying.

1101
01:16:32,711 --> 01:16:36,203
Look, I know Jimmy's out of control.
Believe me, I'm gonna take care of him.

1102
01:16:36,382 --> 01:16:39,510
But you and I, we gotta keep
our heads up here, Ray.

1103
01:16:39,685 --> 01:16:42,381
We gotta handle this so no one else
gets hurt. You hear me?

1104
01:16:42,555 --> 01:16:43,852
We're not gonna handle this.

1105
01:16:44,023 --> 01:16:47,459
What do you think? You think we're
gonna go with Pop and smooth this over?

1106
01:16:47,626 --> 01:16:51,118
That is not gonna happen. This isn't
Mott Haven. I won't stand up for that.

1107
01:16:51,297 --> 01:16:54,232
You know, it's not Mott Haven.
This is not about the department.

1108
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,860
This is about me. My command.
All this shit falls on me, Ray.

1109
01:16:59,038 --> 01:17:02,496
So, what do you wanna do? You wanna
cut me off at the fucking knees?

1110
01:17:02,675 --> 01:17:04,575
You wanna watch me go down in flames?

1111
01:17:04,743 --> 01:17:07,576
Is that gonna satisfy your sense
of right and wrong?

1112
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,644
We got an out here, Ray.

1113
01:17:13,752 --> 01:17:16,084
Jesus, Francis.

1114
01:17:20,559 --> 01:17:22,720
I know this is fucked up, okay?

1115
01:17:22,895 --> 01:17:24,863
But I need you.

1116
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:29,760
This is fucking you and me.

1117
01:17:31,637 --> 01:17:34,697
When we were kids,
all we ever talked about was being cops.

1118
01:17:35,574 --> 01:17:39,374
How the fuck did we end up at this?

1119
01:17:46,652 --> 01:17:48,677
What are you gonna do, Ray?

1120
01:17:50,689 --> 01:17:52,247
I don't know.

1121
01:17:53,225 --> 01:17:56,126
I don't know.
I'm gonna get this fucking blood off me.

1122
01:17:57,429 --> 01:17:58,953
Ray.

1123
01:18:15,481 --> 01:18:18,882
<i>You were gone a long time.
Where were you?</i>

1124
01:18:19,051 --> 01:18:20,518
Uh...

1125
01:18:21,353 --> 01:18:22,911
I just...

1126
01:18:23,789 --> 01:18:26,519
I just had to talk to Ray
about something.

1127
01:18:27,026 --> 01:18:29,017
What is it, Francis?

1128
01:18:29,194 --> 01:18:31,355
Is everything okay?

1129
01:18:35,801 --> 01:18:38,031
You know, Ab, it's not.

1130
01:18:39,538 --> 01:18:40,732
What's going on?

1131
01:18:43,575 --> 01:18:45,566
Oh, fuck, Abby.

1132
01:18:45,744 --> 01:18:49,145
Oh, Francis, talk to me.

1133
01:18:49,314 --> 01:18:52,875
I mean, don't not tell me
something which is...

1134
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,189
Because...

1135
01:19:02,961 --> 01:19:05,191
Those men, Abby.

1136
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:09,828
Those four cops.

1137
01:19:12,438 --> 01:19:15,032
I am right in the middle of something...

1138
01:19:16,675 --> 01:19:19,303
...and I don't know
how to get out of it.

1139
01:19:22,414 --> 01:19:25,611
And I am really fucking scared.

1140
01:19:40,966 --> 01:19:42,729
Can...

1141
01:19:43,535 --> 01:19:45,469
...you see how to...

1142
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:49,703
...make it right?

1143
01:19:55,481 --> 01:19:57,210
Not without...

1144
01:19:58,884 --> 01:20:05,448
Not without ruining everything
I've been working for.

1145
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:11,252
You're a good man, Francis.

1146
01:20:11,697 --> 01:20:13,665
I don't know how...

1147
01:20:14,133 --> 01:20:15,657
How...

1148
01:20:17,236 --> 01:20:19,397
How you got yourself...

1149
01:20:22,474 --> 01:20:26,035
I trust you with my children.

1150
01:20:26,512 --> 01:20:30,539
I need you to be that man.

1151
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:37,386
Do you hear what I'm saying?

1152
01:20:38,991 --> 01:20:40,481
Yeah.

1153
01:20:50,602 --> 01:20:52,900
I got your back, Abby.

1154
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:58,066
<i>A neighbor says she saw
three men she can't identify...</i>

1155
01:20:58,243 --> 01:21:01,701
...get out of a yellow, possibly gold,
'80s Monte Carlo or Grand Prix...

1156
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,247
...and enter the building where
Angel Tezo was later found shot dead.

1157
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:07,476
EMT on the scene confirmed,
off the record...

1158
01:21:07,653 --> 01:21:10,087
...that the victim suffered
a crushed larynx.

1159
01:21:10,255 --> 01:21:13,190
- At the coroner's office...
- Hey, Carlos, you have a call on one.

1160
01:21:13,358 --> 01:21:14,382
Who is it?
- Won't say.

1161
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,494
<i>killed after exchanging gunfire with...</i>

1162
01:21:16,662 --> 01:21:20,496
The coroner's office has yet
to release a copy of the autopsy report...

1163
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:22,861
...nor have they returned
any of my phone calls.

1164

1168

All right. Okay, slow down.
Slow down. Slow down.

1169
01:21:41,086 --> 01:21:44,317
All right. You have to give me some...

1170
01:21:44,489 --> 01:21:46,548
You have to give me something small.

1171
01:21:50,729 --> 01:21:52,162
Uh-huh.

1172
01:21:57,269 --> 01:22:00,761
Okay. And, look, I'm gonna need a name.

1173
01:22:48,287 --> 01:22:49,720
Are you alone?

1174
01:22:49,888 --> 01:22:51,879
Yeah.
- Don't fuck with me, man.

1175
01:22:52,057 --> 01:22:56,016
- I swear to God, don't fuck with me.
- I'm not, man. I'm being straight.

1176
01:22:56,194 --> 01:22:58,822
Nobody knows I'm here,
nobody knows you're here.

1177
01:23:04,636 --> 01:23:06,627
You recording this?

1178
01:23:07,072 --> 01:23:08,630
Do you want me to?

1179
01:23:08,807 --> 01:23:09,933
You got a recorder?

1180
01:23:10,108 --> 01:23:11,132
No.

1181
01:23:12,811 --> 01:23:15,439
Then I don't want you to record it.

1182
01:23:15,714 --> 01:23:17,147
Okay.

1183
01:23:19,418 --> 01:23:22,410
All right, look, you could just...
You just talk, all right?

1184
01:23:22,587 --> 01:23:25,715
Tell me anything you wanna say,
I won't interrupt you. Say whatever.

1185
01:23:25,891 --> 01:23:28,621
So you can get my story, right?
So you can fuck me.

1186
01:23:28,794 --> 01:23:31,991
- Turn my name to shit, is that it?
- Hey, Sandy. You called me.

1187
01:23:32,164 --> 01:23:34,655
I'm not a priest, I'm a writer.

1188
01:23:35,834 --> 01:23:40,498
I came down here to freeze my ass off
sitting in this fucking car. I did my part.

1189
01:23:43,942 --> 01:23:46,570
I gotta get this out of me.

1190
01:23:48,113 --> 01:23:51,048
- I gotta get this out.
- What?

1191
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:53,618
We're all dirty.

1192
01:23:55,153 --> 01:23:59,351
We sold our shields off,
highest bidder, murder for hire.

1193
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:05,290
Stole drugs off dead men, planted shit...

1194
01:24:06,631 --> 01:24:07,723
...beat suspects.

1195
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:10,834
We robbed and...

1196
01:24:17,843 --> 01:24:21,745
We condemned four of our own to die.

1197
01:24:22,848 --> 01:24:25,112
- What are you talking about?
- Washington Heights.

1198
01:24:26,018 --> 01:24:28,316
We sent them into a slaughter.

1199
01:24:28,487 --> 01:24:33,447
- Who? Who, Sandy? Who sent those men?
- I fucking told you, no names!

1200
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:36,685
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1201
01:24:39,364 --> 01:24:41,594
I can't undo it now.

1202
01:24:42,534 --> 01:24:44,695
There's no atoning.

1203
01:24:45,504 --> 01:24:48,405
I'm gonna burn, man.
I'm gonna fucking burn.

1204
01:24:48,573 --> 01:24:51,007
No, no, no. No, this is...
We can work this out, okay?

1205
01:24:51,176 --> 01:24:54,373
No, no, no.
- Look, I'm gonna call my city desk.

1206
01:24:54,546 --> 01:24:56,980
All right? I'm gonna call my editor.
All right?

1207
01:24:57,149 --> 01:25:00,118
To save space for your story, okay?
Your story.

1208
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:02,843
Okay?

1209
01:25:04,389 --> 01:25:06,357
Becoming a cop...

1210
01:25:09,261 --> 01:25:11,729
...the respect that earned us...

1211
01:25:15,734 --> 01:25:17,361
...the pledge we took...

1212
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:21,300
...to uphold something honest...

1213
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:26,272
Being in the blue, wearing that shield...

1214
01:25:30,882 --> 01:25:33,350
...the pride that I felt...

1215
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,813
...the fucking glory...

1216
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:44,487
We let it all go out from under us.

1217
01:25:53,305 --> 01:25:55,637
I was a good man once.

1218
01:26:52,731 --> 01:26:54,790
Who is it?

1219
01:26:54,966 --> 01:26:56,433
It's Kenny.

1220
01:26:56,601 --> 01:26:57,966
What does he want?

1221
01:26:58,136 --> 01:27:00,798
I just got up.
How the fuck should I know?

1222
01:27:04,442 --> 01:27:06,808
Jesus Christ.

1223
01:27:10,348 --> 01:27:12,441
We're about to get fucked.

1224
01:27:12,617 --> 01:27:14,312
He's dead. Jimmy, he's fucking dead.

1225
01:27:14,486 --> 01:27:16,010
Sandy fucking killed himself.

1226
01:27:16,188 --> 01:27:17,917
Shh. Come on.

1227
01:27:18,089 --> 01:27:19,215
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1228
01:27:20,025 --> 01:27:23,358
...it is with sorrow
and a deep sense of regret...

1229
01:27:23,528 --> 01:27:26,224
...that I appear before you today.

1230
01:27:27,299 --> 01:27:29,062
At 10:30 p.m. last night...

1231
01:27:29,501 --> 01:27:34,097
...Officer Ruben Santiago of the
31 st Precinct in Washington Heights...

1232
01:27:34,839 --> 01:27:36,397
...took his own life.

1233
01:27:36,575 --> 01:27:38,907
Officer Santiago...

1234
01:27:39,077 --> 01:27:43,036
...along with the four officers slain
in Washington Heights...

1235
01:27:43,215 --> 01:27:46,582
...had formed an illicit criminal cabal.

1236
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:50,312
Working in collusion
and under the aegis of the N.Y.P. D...

1237
01:27:50,488 --> 01:27:54,447
...these officers undertook all manner
of criminal misdeed.

1238
01:27:54,626 --> 01:27:57,823
Investigators from Internal Affairs
have isolated the involvement...

1239
01:27:57,996 --> 01:28:00,556
Where the hell have you been?
- of this rogue unit...

1240
01:28:00,732 --> 01:28:02,927
...to the deceased men.
- Yeah, we need to talk.

1241
01:28:03,101 --> 01:28:06,593
- No other officer in 31 st Precinct...
- Yeah, okay. Tonight.

1242
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:08,966
...has been found culpable of...
- You be there.

1243
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:12,132
...or in any way linked
to this criminal conspiracy.

1244
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:14,107
Francis.

1245
01:28:16,414 --> 01:28:18,245
Francis.

1246
01:28:19,217 --> 01:28:20,707
What the hell is going on here?

1247
01:28:20,885 --> 01:28:24,821
- I can't talk, Pop, I gotta go.
- What the hell is going on here, Francis?

1248
01:28:25,156 --> 01:28:27,317
How involved are you?

1249
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,552
Look at me.

1250
01:28:30,729 --> 01:28:32,492
Look at me.

1251
01:28:36,301 --> 01:28:37,996
Did you know what they were doing?

1252
01:28:39,104 --> 01:28:41,038
I knew enough.

1253
01:28:45,677 --> 01:28:49,306
Dad, come on, man. All those years,
you never got jammed up?

1254
01:28:49,481 --> 01:28:52,541
- It never came down on top of you?
- No.

1255
01:28:53,051 --> 01:28:54,484
Because I kept my head up.

1256
01:28:54,653 --> 01:28:57,315
All I took was a check cut by the city.
That's all I took.

1257
01:28:57,489 --> 01:28:59,957
I didn't take any money.
I didn't take a fucking cent.

1258
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:03,253
Then what? What did you do?

1259
01:29:05,897 --> 01:29:09,298
- I gotta go. I'm sorry.
- Francis, sit down. Let's talk.

1260
01:29:09,467 --> 01:29:12,868
- I'm here to help you, Franny.
- I can't do this now, Pop. I gotta go.

1261
01:29:13,038 --> 01:29:16,838
I gotta do this my way, all right?
I'm sorry.

1262
01:29:33,806 --> 01:29:36,673
Happy New Year!

1263
01:29:51,223 --> 01:29:54,317
Happy fucking New Year!

1264
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,055
Taxi!

1265
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:11,403
Thanks.

1266
01:30:32,097 --> 01:30:33,121
Fuck!

1267
01:30:33,298 --> 01:30:35,027
Move, I'll break it off.

1268
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,326
Who are you?

1269
01:30:36,502 --> 01:30:39,335
Bragon, Carlos Bragon.
I'm a reporter, for chrissake!

1270
01:30:40,139 --> 01:30:42,972
- You know me, Tierney.
- Shut up, shut up!

1271
01:30:43,142 --> 01:30:45,736
You know me, Tierney. You know me.

1272
01:30:47,446 --> 01:30:49,311
Yeah, I know you, you fucking hack.

1273
01:30:49,481 --> 01:30:52,575
What the fuck are you doing following me?
What do you want?

1274
01:30:53,051 --> 01:30:54,814
I'm writing a story.

1275
01:30:54,987 --> 01:30:57,922
I got two versions,
I wanna run them by you.

1276
01:30:58,090 --> 01:30:59,887
First one goes like this:

1277
01:31:00,058 --> 01:31:03,653
Hero detective captures cop killer.
Kills him in self-defense.

1278
01:31:03,829 --> 01:31:05,456
Yeah, what else?

1279
01:31:05,631 --> 01:31:08,657
The other one is key witness
in a cop-corruption case...

1280
01:31:08,834 --> 01:31:12,235
...dies mysteriously in the presence
of cops from the 31 st Precinct.

1281
01:31:12,404 --> 01:31:15,202
- Which one sounds better?
- Whatever sells more papers, right?

1282
01:31:15,374 --> 01:31:18,309
Yeah, I know cops from the 31
were there before you, Ray.

1283
01:31:18,477 --> 01:31:20,570
That's your brother's house, isn't it?

1284
01:31:22,881 --> 01:31:27,875
Sources are telling me that Angel Tezo
was tortured and was executed.

1285
01:31:28,053 --> 01:31:31,386
He had half his teeth shoved down
to his belly, splinters in his throat.

1286
01:31:31,557 --> 01:31:34,321
- You carry a stick?
- Keep pushing me, you're gonna find out.

1287
01:31:34,493 --> 01:31:38,156
I'm trying to help you. Be smart.

1288
01:31:38,831 --> 01:31:40,799
I can be writing a story
about Ray Tierney.

1289
01:31:40,966 --> 01:31:43,059
But I should be writing a story
about the 31.

1290
01:31:46,438 --> 01:31:49,669
You were there. Here's your opportunity
to set it straight right now.

1291
01:31:49,975 --> 01:31:52,239
I don't like my odds with you.

1292
01:31:52,544 --> 01:31:55,069
Last cop you talked to
blew his brains out in your car.

1293
01:31:55,247 --> 01:31:58,341
Last time I saw you, you were
feeding bullshit to the grand jury.

1294
01:31:58,517 --> 01:32:01,975
I was only sitting there
because of your hard-on to crucify cops.

1295
01:32:02,154 --> 01:32:05,214
I do. Because they were protecting
their own and burying the truth.

1296
01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:09,383
Don't talk to me about the truth. You got
no idea what it takes to do what we do.

1297
01:32:09,561 --> 01:32:11,893
- You weren't there.
- You wanna know what I know?

1298
01:32:12,064 --> 01:32:14,498
I know you took a bullet in the face
during the raid.

1299
01:32:14,967 --> 01:32:18,266
I know Kareem Aldovise, a 19-year-old
kid, went off that roof and died.

1300
01:32:18,437 --> 01:32:19,461
Everybody knows that.

1301
01:32:19,638 --> 01:32:22,869
Yeah, and I know a witness
saw him surrender before they did it.

1302
01:32:23,575 --> 01:32:26,544
He had no priors, he had no gun.

1303
01:32:27,512 --> 01:32:30,413
You wanna bullshit the grand jury, fine.
Don't do it to me.

1304
01:32:30,582 --> 01:32:34,518
Well, in case you didn't hear, they cleared
us two years ago, okay? Case closed.

1305
01:32:34,686 --> 01:32:38,122
So don't get in my face because you're
skeeved about losing your Pulitzer.

1306
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:40,383
But you know what?
I don't really think about it that much.

1307
01:32:52,771 --> 01:32:55,740
Wake up, all right? Come on.

1308
01:33:00,579 --> 01:33:02,206
Jimmy!

1309
01:33:02,381 --> 01:33:03,814
Jimmy!

1310
01:33:03,982 --> 01:33:05,244
Help.

1311
01:33:05,417 --> 01:33:07,851
Help me, Jimmy.

1312
01:33:18,997 --> 01:33:20,726
Hey, boss.

1313
01:33:22,334 --> 01:33:23,392
Where is he?

1314
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:02,763
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1315
01:34:03,241 --> 01:34:07,837
Mayor goes on TV, moans the loss, gives us
a clean bill of health. What's the problem?

1316
01:34:08,013 --> 01:34:11,278
I asked you point-blank, "Were you
involved in this?" What did you say?

1317
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:13,008
I said what you wanted to hear.

1318
01:34:13,185 --> 01:34:15,653
- I wanted the fucking truth.
- What truth?

1319
01:34:15,821 --> 01:34:20,053
Truth about the money we were getting?
The dirty cops you preside over?

1320
01:34:20,225 --> 01:34:22,693
You knew. All you cared about
was your promotion.

1321
01:34:22,861 --> 01:34:24,726
- I knew what was fucking going on?
- Yeah.

1322
01:34:24,896 --> 01:34:27,888
I gave you room to get the job done.
If you took a little here...

1323
01:34:28,066 --> 01:34:30,193
...I wasn't looking.
But you crossed the line.

1324
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:33,566
What, you think because you didn't
take an envelope, it absolves you?

1325
01:34:33,739 --> 01:34:35,969
Silk hat, same pig.

1326
01:34:36,141 --> 01:34:38,803
Crimes down, collars up.
It's what you wanted.

1327
01:34:38,977 --> 01:34:41,411
End justifies the means, buddy boy.

1328
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:43,980
Let me tell you something, Jimmy.

1329
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:48,677
You think you can set Ray up for this?
You are dead fucking wrong.

1330
01:34:48,854 --> 01:34:52,153
We took you in.
You were a fucking brother to us.

1331
01:34:52,324 --> 01:34:55,816
My sister's your wife, your family's my
family, and you jam us up like this?

1332
01:34:55,994 --> 01:34:59,657
I jam you? I saved you. It's a lay-up, Fran.

1333
01:34:59,831 --> 01:35:02,163
Oh, yeah? How's that, Jimmy?
Run that by me.

1334
01:35:02,334 --> 01:35:05,269
- Ray sticks to the story, he's a hero.
- That's not gonna happen.

1335
01:35:05,437 --> 01:35:08,133
- You're gonna make this right, or I swear...
- Or what?

1336
01:35:08,306 --> 01:35:10,740
What the fuck are you gonna do, Franny?

1337
01:35:10,909 --> 01:35:14,709
You gonna burn down your own house?
Blow up everything you worked for?

1338
01:35:15,547 --> 01:35:17,310
All Ray's gotta do is walk into IAB...

1339
01:35:17,482 --> 01:35:20,849
...say what needs to be said,
end of fucking story.

1340
01:35:21,019 --> 01:35:24,352
- We go home, we go to sleep at night.
- You think this ends that simply?

1341
01:35:24,523 --> 01:35:28,459
We all go to sleep at night. Let me tell you,
what we've done does not get forgiven.

1342
01:35:28,627 --> 01:35:31,061
Here we go with the
Sister Mary Margarets.

1343
01:35:31,229 --> 01:35:32,958
Someone says you're dirty, who cares?

1344
01:35:33,131 --> 01:35:35,326
They say you're fucking corrupt.
Fuck them.

1345
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,491
Do they know how these animals live?

1346
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:40,137
We tour the sewers, Franny!

1347
01:35:40,305 --> 01:35:43,331
I will not apologize for doing what I do.
I earn 65 grand a year.

1348
01:35:43,508 --> 01:35:47,467
Some fuck like Tezo wipes his ass
with that shit in a week.

1349
01:35:49,081 --> 01:35:51,311
We're in this together, Franny.

1350
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:55,517
- What the fuck is that?
- It's your cut. I've been keeping it for you.

1351
01:35:55,987 --> 01:35:58,217
Take the fucking money, Franny.

1352
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:01,989
Take the fucking money, Franny.

1353
01:36:03,061 --> 01:36:05,222
You were my brother, Jimmy.

1354
01:36:05,664 --> 01:36:08,155
Franny. Take...

1355
01:36:22,247 --> 01:36:23,407
Fuck.

1356
01:36:43,301 --> 01:36:45,269
Yeah, Tierney.

1357
01:36:48,473 --> 01:36:51,101
Whoa, whoa, whoa. IAB?

1358
01:36:55,347 --> 01:36:58,339
Well, no, no,
but I thought I'd have some time.

1359
01:37:00,552 --> 01:37:02,747
<i>Detective, let me start
by saying we're aware...</i>

1360
01:37:02,921 --> 01:37:05,651
<i>... of your outstanding service record...</i>

1361
01:37:05,824 --> 01:37:08,691
<i>... and we wanna thank you
for your role in solving this case.</i>

1362
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:12,091
<i>We're gonna make this as brief as possible,
gonna get you out of here.</i>

1363
01:37:12,264 --> 01:37:16,428
<i>We need a statement detailing
your participation in the incident on record.</i>

1364
01:37:16,601 --> 01:37:20,128
<i>Now, you declined to give a
statement at the scene of the shooting.</i>

1365
01:37:20,305 --> 01:37:22,569
<i>- Is that correct?
- That's right.</i>

1366
01:37:22,741 --> 01:37:26,837
Mr. Tezo was tried and sentenced
in a bathroom in the Bronx.

1367
01:37:27,312 --> 01:37:29,246
<i>But you're prepared to give us one now?</i>

1368
01:37:29,414 --> 01:37:30,745
Far removed from a jury.

1369
01:37:30,916 --> 01:37:33,180
<i>- Far removed from a judge.
- I'm gonna do my best.</i>

1370
01:37:33,351 --> 01:37:37,583
<i>Far removed from our basic rights
endowed on all men by our Constitution.</i>

1371
01:37:38,023 --> 01:37:39,684
This march will commence at noon.

1372
01:37:39,858 --> 01:37:43,123
<i>Can you explain how your
investigation led to the apprehension of Tezo?</i>

1373
01:37:43,295 --> 01:37:45,695
- and end up on the steps
of the 31 st Precinct.

1374
01:37:45,864 --> 01:37:49,425
<i>Angel Tezo was identified by
witnesses at the scene of the shooting.</i>

1375
01:37:49,601 --> 01:37:52,069
<i>I sought information
regarding his whereabouts...</i>

1376
01:37:52,237 --> 01:37:54,501
<i>... from a former confidential informant.</i>

1377
01:37:54,673 --> 01:37:57,870
<i>He directed me to the location in question
in Morrisania...</i>

1378
01:37:58,043 --> 01:37:59,704
<i>... and I followed that lead.</i>

1379
01:37:59,878 --> 01:38:04,178
The reverend reiterated
that this planned march is about peace...

1380
01:38:04,349 --> 01:38:09,878
<i>... and is not intended as a condemnation
of the entire N.Y.P.D.</i>

1381
01:38:10,055 --> 01:38:12,580
<i>His target: the 31 st Precinct...</i>

1382
01:38:12,757 --> 01:38:16,488
...and the officers involved in the
Angel Tezo killing.

1383
01:38:16,661 --> 01:38:18,458
The investigation is continuing.

1384
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:22,066
- Now, did you pursue this lead alone?
- No.

1385
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,460
I called the task force.
I spoke to my colleague, Detective Miller.

1386
01:38:25,637 --> 01:38:29,505
I told him where I was going.
I requested backup, and he initiated that.

1387
01:38:29,674 --> 01:38:31,869
But you arrived on the location alone.

1388
01:38:32,043 --> 01:38:34,568
I arrived before the rest of the team, yes.

1389
01:38:35,814 --> 01:38:37,475
Okay.

1390
01:38:39,751 --> 01:38:44,051
Now, could you describe for us what
transpired at the location in question...

1391
01:38:44,222 --> 01:38:47,487
...leading up to you having to
discharge your weapon?

1392
01:38:57,502 --> 01:38:58,833
Detective?

1393
01:39:14,686 --> 01:39:17,086
This isn't gonna go how you want it to.

1394
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:19,518
Excuse me?

1395
01:39:24,095 --> 01:39:26,791
I know what you guys want me to say...

1396
01:39:27,299 --> 01:39:28,664
...but it's not gonna happen.

1397
01:39:28,833 --> 01:39:32,530
No one's looking for you to say anything
except your version of what happened.

1398
01:39:32,704 --> 01:39:34,899
- Really?
- All we need is a full accounting...

1399
01:39:35,073 --> 01:39:36,938
...of what happened,
then we can go home.

1400
01:39:37,108 --> 01:39:39,133
Yeah, I know what you need.

1401
01:39:39,944 --> 01:39:43,402
But I can't give it to you,
because I didn't shoot him.

1402
01:39:43,581 --> 01:39:47,039
Are you aware that ballistics
has confirmed that the perp was killed...

1403
01:39:47,218 --> 01:39:50,016
<i>... by three bullets fired from your gun
at close range?</i>

1404
01:39:50,188 --> 01:39:51,416
<i>I am.</i>

1405
01:39:51,589 --> 01:39:53,557
<i>But you maintain
that you didn't shoot him?</i>

1406
01:39:53,725 --> 01:39:55,192
<i>I do.</i>

1407
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,885
<i>Could you elaborate on that?
- No, I would not care to.</i>

1408
01:39:58,063 --> 01:40:00,156
<i>What are you saying, detective?</i>

1409
01:40:00,332 --> 01:40:02,766
<i>From here on out, nothing.</i>

1410
01:40:02,934 --> 01:40:06,028
<i>I respectfully refuse
to answer any further questions.</i>

1411
01:40:06,204 --> 01:40:09,264
<i>Are you denying that you
were involved in the Angel Tezo killing?</i>

1412
01:40:09,441 --> 01:40:14,003
<i>I respectfully refuse
to answer any more questions.</i>

1413
01:40:14,179 --> 01:40:16,579
<i>If you don't start answering,
this is gonna go bad.</i>

1414
01:40:16,748 --> 01:40:18,215
<i>We can do this all afternoon...</i>

1415
01:40:18,383 --> 01:40:22,046
<i>... but I have nothing more to say
in this matter.</i>

1416
01:40:23,488 --> 01:40:27,049
<i>This wasn't like Ray. He's not that guy.</i>

1417
01:40:27,225 --> 01:40:29,489
<i>He's a fucking good cop.</i>

1418
01:40:30,528 --> 01:40:32,462
<i>He's a good man.</i>

1419
01:40:33,131 --> 01:40:35,964
<i>He said something about Lonnie Mercer,
"Lonnie and I."</i>

1420
01:40:36,134 --> 01:40:39,797
<i>I remember that they were close.
They were partners.</i>

1421
01:40:39,971 --> 01:40:43,566
<i>Lonnie Mercer, one of the
officers killed in the Washington Heights raid?</i>

1422
01:40:43,742 --> 01:40:44,936
<i>That's right.</i>

1423
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:47,078
<i>What happened next?</i>

1424
01:40:47,545 --> 01:40:49,274
<i>I tried to revive Mr. Tezo.</i>

1425
01:40:49,447 --> 01:40:52,143
<i>I didn't know if he'd had a heart attack...</i>

1426
01:40:52,317 --> 01:40:54,649
<i>... or if he was still alive.
I tried to revive him.</i>

1427
01:40:54,819 --> 01:40:57,686
<i>I checked for a pulse,
I couldn't find a fucking pulse.</i>

1428
01:40:57,856 --> 01:40:59,255
<i>He looked pretty fucking dead.</i>

1429
01:41:00,458 --> 01:41:03,621
<i>So I did some fucking CPR.</i>

1430
01:41:03,795 --> 01:41:08,858
<i>After I tried to revive him,
I was still kneeling over the body.</i>

1431
01:41:11,803 --> 01:41:14,067
<i>That's when the shots went off.</i>

1432
01:41:18,877 --> 01:41:20,640
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1433
01:41:20,812 --> 01:41:22,507
<i>Who was shot?</i>

1434
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:25,808
<i>- Mr. Tezo was shot?
- Yeah.</i>

1435
01:41:25,984 --> 01:41:28,817
<i>Yeah, he was shot. Yeah, he was shot.</i>

1436
01:41:28,987 --> 01:41:32,252
<i>Got what he fucking deserved.
Got what he fucking deserved.</i>

1437
01:41:32,791 --> 01:41:34,918
<i>Who shot Mr. Tezo?</i>

1438
01:41:38,363 --> 01:41:41,025
<i>I would've done the same thing myself.</i>

1439
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:44,498
<i>Who shot Angel Tezo, Sergeant Egan?</i>

1440
01:41:50,275 --> 01:41:52,334
<i>Detective Tierney.</i>

1441
01:41:53,912 --> 01:41:56,403
<i>Detective Raymond Tierney?</i>

1442
01:42:02,353 --> 01:42:03,718
<i>Yes.</i>

1443
01:42:14,365 --> 01:42:16,094
Listen, Frank...

1444
01:42:16,267 --> 01:42:21,762
...I know how this must feel,
and I wish I knew what to say.

1445
01:42:22,874 --> 01:42:27,709
But you should know that these officers
are all prepared to testify at a grand jury.

1446
01:42:28,546 --> 01:42:31,344
So what's critical now,
from here on out...

1447
01:42:31,516 --> 01:42:35,577
...is that we handle this thing quietly,
with as little incident as possible.

1448
01:42:35,753 --> 01:42:38,221
He's not capable of that.

1449
01:42:38,823 --> 01:42:40,688
I know my son. He's not capable of that.

1450
01:42:40,859 --> 01:42:44,158
Frank, we're gonna have to bring Ray in.

1451
01:42:51,936 --> 01:42:53,494
You okay?

1452
01:42:54,138 --> 01:42:55,799
Hey.

1453
01:43:01,045 --> 01:43:02,979
I'm proud of you.

1454
01:43:04,716 --> 01:43:06,809
Call me when it's done.

1455
01:43:07,685 --> 01:43:11,678
<i>They wanna take you in,
put "arrest pending" in the press tomorrow.</i>

1456
01:43:11,856 --> 01:43:14,689
I'm sitting there on my ass,
watching this fucking testimony.

1457
01:43:14,859 --> 01:43:16,884
You believe that shit
that Jimmy's spinning?

1458
01:43:17,061 --> 01:43:21,157
- You gonna tell me you believe that?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

1459
01:43:21,332 --> 01:43:24,859
I told you to run everything through me
and that we would handle it.

1460
01:43:25,036 --> 01:43:28,199
And then you sit down
with the goddamn IAB...

1461
01:43:28,373 --> 01:43:29,772
...and don't give me a heads up?

1462
01:43:29,941 --> 01:43:32,205
No fucking phone call?
You don't talk to me, Ray.

1463
01:43:32,377 --> 01:43:34,345
I'm here. I'm telling you now, okay?

1464
01:43:34,512 --> 01:43:37,709
Listen to me. Jimmy is a drug dealer, Pop.

1465
01:43:37,882 --> 01:43:41,215
He murdered that guy, and Fran is in it.
Pop, he's in up to his neck.

1466
01:43:41,386 --> 01:43:45,550
Now, I tried. I tried to talk to Fran,
and when I sat in there with those guys...

1467
01:43:45,723 --> 01:43:49,454
...I gave them nothing.
I said as little as I could say.

1468
01:43:49,627 --> 01:43:54,564
But if Jimmy's gonna box me in, I gotta tell
them what I know. I got no fucking choice.

1469
01:43:54,732 --> 01:43:56,859
The fuck you got no choice.

1470
01:43:57,035 --> 01:43:59,697
You could've taken that lay-up
that they were handing you.

1471
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:02,669
- Oh, no. No, Pop.
- And saved us a fucking mess.

1472
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,603
Come on. What good would it have done?

1473
01:44:04,776 --> 01:44:08,610
Jimmy's a scumbag. Jesus.
We'll take care of him.

1474
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:12,841
But we got a hole that needs
to get plugged up...

1475
01:44:13,017 --> 01:44:15,247
...before it takes down
half the department.

1476
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,217
It's too late, Pop.

1477
01:44:18,089 --> 01:44:20,421
We protect our own, Ray.

1478
01:44:20,592 --> 01:44:24,255
That is all I know. We protect our own.
You gotta show me some fucking loyalty.

1479
01:44:24,429 --> 01:44:28,991
No. Don't use that word with me. It doesn't
mean shit to me anymore, you know that?

1480
01:44:29,167 --> 01:44:31,067
I done your loyalty. It cost me too much.

1481
01:44:31,235 --> 01:44:34,398
- What did it cost you?
- It cost me everything!

1482
01:44:35,006 --> 01:44:37,600
It cost me the woman that I love.

1483
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:41,940
Because she told me that we were wrong
on Mott Haven.

1484
01:44:42,113 --> 01:44:43,478
She told me. I didn't listen.

1485
01:44:43,648 --> 01:44:46,583
Look, you said you weren't sure about
what you saw. I heard it.

1486
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:49,447
You heard what you wanted to hear.
Don't bullshit me.

1487
01:44:49,621 --> 01:44:52,954
It was a lie to protect a bad cop,
and you knew it, and I knew it.

1488
01:44:53,124 --> 01:44:55,820
And I got up there and said it
in front of the grand jury.

1489
01:44:55,994 --> 01:44:57,689
- I got it.
- I'm not gonna do this.

1490
01:44:57,862 --> 01:44:59,727
- Not for you.
- I'm responsible, huh?

1491
01:44:59,897 --> 01:45:04,095
- This is my responsibility, this shit?
- No. We did wrong. I wanna hear you say it.

1492
01:45:04,268 --> 01:45:05,667
Both of you, stop the yelling.

1493
01:45:05,837 --> 01:45:07,964
- Get out of here, Mo.
- No. Stop it.

1494
01:45:08,139 --> 01:45:09,834
- Get out of here.
- I am not leaving.

1495
01:45:10,008 --> 01:45:11,498
- This is not for you.
- No, no.

1496
01:45:11,676 --> 01:45:13,940
- I am not leaving.
- I don't want you hearing this.

1497
01:45:14,112 --> 01:45:15,636
Hey, hey, hey. Dad, take it easy.

1498
01:45:15,813 --> 01:45:18,543
- Don't yell at her.
- Get upstairs.

1499
01:45:19,584 --> 01:45:20,778
This is too much.

1500
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:42,567
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen good.

1501
01:45:42,740 --> 01:45:44,799
This is not just about the department.

1502
01:45:44,976 --> 01:45:47,570
That's not what we're talking about here.

1503
01:45:47,745 --> 01:45:50,373
This is family. This is our way of life.

1504
01:45:50,548 --> 01:45:52,015
Jimmy is married to your sister.

1505
01:45:52,183 --> 01:45:55,983
He's the father of her children,
for chrissake.

1506
01:45:56,154 --> 01:46:00,488
And your brother is in a bad hour here,
and the only way through this is you.

1507
01:46:00,658 --> 01:46:02,922
You're the only door.

1508
01:46:03,561 --> 01:46:07,361
Jimmy is gonna take back his story.
I'll see to that.

1509
01:46:07,532 --> 01:46:10,626
And you just follow the crumbs
like they're laid out for you.

1510
01:46:10,802 --> 01:46:13,066
Take a deep breath
and say what needs to be said.

1511
01:46:13,237 --> 01:46:17,765
Like you believe it with every bone of your
body, and then we move through this thing.

1512
01:46:17,942 --> 01:46:21,105
- And that's what you're gonna do.
- No.

1513
01:46:21,813 --> 01:46:24,247
No, he's not gonna do that, Pop.

1514
01:46:26,484 --> 01:46:30,648
- Franny, listen.
- Ray is not getting hung out for what I did.

1515
01:46:30,822 --> 01:46:32,016
What I did.

1516
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:34,681
He'll get a slap on the wrist,
nothing more.

1517
01:46:34,859 --> 01:46:37,726
- You're not thinking clearly, Franny.
- Yeah, I am.

1518
01:46:37,895 --> 01:46:43,265
Listen to me, Pop. This shit ends now.

1519
01:46:43,434 --> 01:46:45,299
Tonight.

1520
01:46:47,405 --> 01:46:50,738
And if that means
I can't be a cop anymore...

1521
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:53,471
...I'm okay with that.

1522
01:47:10,928 --> 01:47:12,361
What do you want me to do?

1523
01:47:13,831 --> 01:47:17,289
We're gonna get Jimmy.
That's what we're gonna do.

1524
01:47:18,302 --> 01:47:20,463
Yeah. Okay.

1525
01:47:36,454 --> 01:47:38,888
Just gonna make a stop over here.

1526
01:47:39,257 --> 01:47:41,054
Real quick.

1527
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:44,557
What are you doing?

1528
01:47:44,896 --> 01:47:46,420
I gotta pick something up.

1529
01:47:46,597 --> 01:47:49,065
Picking up what?
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is that?

1530
01:47:49,233 --> 01:47:52,430
- I gotta make a collection.
- A collection with a gun? Jesus, come on.

1531
01:47:52,603 --> 01:47:55,037
Jimmy told us to lay low.
Stay under the radar.

1532
01:47:55,206 --> 01:47:58,505
- You know what? Fuck Jimmy.
- Fuck Jimmy? What are you talking about?

1533
01:47:58,676 --> 01:48:01,474
- Jimmy's looking out for us.
- Jimmy ain't looking out for me!

1534
01:48:01,646 --> 01:48:06,310
He ain't paying my fucking rent! I got no
fucking money in my pocket. I'm broke!

1535
01:48:06,484 --> 01:48:09,282
- Jeez, you coming with me or not?
- No, I'm not coming, Eddie.

1536
01:48:09,453 --> 01:48:12,445
- Do what you wanna do. Stay here.
- I will fucking stay here.

1537
01:48:18,663 --> 01:48:20,358
Yo, bro.

1538
01:48:37,915 --> 01:48:41,282
No, I'm not a fucking cop anymore.
Get the fuck out of here.

1539
01:48:44,155 --> 01:48:46,350
You gotta do this every time?

1540
01:48:47,825 --> 01:48:50,555
Let's fucking go, Eddie. Let's go.

1541
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:54,554
- Shit, Eddie!
- Get down. get down.

1542
01:48:54,732 --> 01:48:57,257
Eddie, fucking... Eddie.

1543
01:48:57,435 --> 01:48:59,198
I see how it is.

1544
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:03,602
Out of the store. I'm a cop. Out of the
fucking store. Get the fuck out of the store!

1545
01:49:03,774 --> 01:49:06,299
Give me the fucking gun.
Give me the fucking gun now.

1546
01:49:06,477 --> 01:49:11,278
Get down! Get the fuck down!
Out now! Go.

1547
01:49:11,449 --> 01:49:13,974
He got a gun, man.
- You! You!

1548
01:49:14,986 --> 01:49:18,444
- You!
- Oh, shit.

1549
01:49:18,623 --> 01:49:20,454
Yo, that's that nigga right there.

1550
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:30,533
<i>That's what I said.
- You sure?</i>

1551
01:49:30,701 --> 01:49:32,692
<i>Yes, I'm sure.</i>

1552
01:49:32,937 --> 01:49:35,872
No, I can't talk right now, Megan.

1553
01:49:37,174 --> 01:49:39,233
I know it, I'm with him.

1554
01:49:40,278 --> 01:49:42,371
No, we'll call you soon.

1555
01:49:42,847 --> 01:49:43,973
Okay.

1556
01:49:46,984 --> 01:49:49,214
He's at Irish Eyes.

1557
01:49:52,056 --> 01:49:54,786
You motherfucker, unlock that door!

1558
01:49:54,959 --> 01:49:59,555
You stupid, stupid idiot, Eddie.
You fucking...

1559
01:50:03,267 --> 01:50:05,963
How do I get out of here?

1560
01:50:06,137 --> 01:50:07,661
Is there another way out of here?

1561
01:50:07,838 --> 01:50:09,897
Tell me.
Is there another way out of here?

1562
01:50:16,547 --> 01:50:19,414
- Back door.
- Fucking show me. Show me!

1563
01:50:19,583 --> 01:50:21,175
Goddamn it. Go right or left?

1564
01:50:21,352 --> 01:50:22,944
Left.

1565
01:50:25,623 --> 01:50:28,524
Oh, shit! Is there another fucking exit?

1566
01:50:28,693 --> 01:50:30,422
No, fuck it. Don't talk.

1567
01:50:30,594 --> 01:50:33,222
<i>Callback, Central.
- Stand by, units.</i>

1568
01:50:35,833 --> 01:50:37,596
<i>- Tierney.
We got a 10-30 on Audubon.</i>

1569
01:50:37,768 --> 01:50:41,226
<i>- I know. It's coming over the radio.
- That ain't the problem, I got a riot.</i>

1570
01:50:41,405 --> 01:50:43,930
Wait, man, slow down.
I can't understand you. What?

1571
01:50:44,108 --> 01:50:46,770
<i>Looks like it's two guys from
your command. Two SNEU guys.</i>

1572
01:50:47,311 --> 01:50:48,869
Who?

1573
01:50:50,848 --> 01:50:52,645
I'm on my way.

1574
01:50:53,284 --> 01:50:54,774
It's Dugan and Carbone.

1575
01:50:54,952 --> 01:50:57,182
<i>I'm gonna need units for crowd control.</i>

1576
01:50:57,355 --> 01:50:58,652
You gotta go.

1577
01:50:58,823 --> 01:51:00,950
I'll get Jimmy.

1578
01:51:01,125 --> 01:51:02,786
Destroy that piece of shit!

1579
01:51:14,638 --> 01:51:17,334
I fucking told you not to do it.

1580
01:51:25,883 --> 01:51:28,750
Chief Tierney,
I'm Captain Lavier from Internal Affairs.

1581
01:51:28,919 --> 01:51:32,047
Have a warrant for your son's arrest.
We'd like him to come with us.

1582
01:51:32,223 --> 01:51:34,316
What makes you think he's here?

1583
01:51:34,892 --> 01:51:36,086
Car's outside.

1584
01:51:36,927 --> 01:51:39,088
Got a message? I'll tell him.

1585
01:51:39,263 --> 01:51:42,721
- How about if I come in myself and tell him?
- No, you're not invited.

1586
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:46,392
Now, get the hell off my porch
and take your boys with you.

1587
01:51:47,571 --> 01:51:49,004
Let's go.

1588
01:51:49,173 --> 01:51:51,573
You can tell your superiors I said so.

1589
01:51:52,843 --> 01:51:54,037
Let's go.

1590
01:51:58,783 --> 01:52:02,048
They got the fucking place surrounded.
Just get down here, Jimmy.

1591
01:52:03,721 --> 01:52:05,552
We'll meet back here.

1592
01:52:16,767 --> 01:52:19,429
What's going down in there? Pepe okay?

1593
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:22,404
I hope Pepe killed 20
of you motherfuckers.

1594
01:52:22,573 --> 01:52:24,541
Let's go. Move back.

1595
01:52:25,409 --> 01:52:27,604
Do you believe this shit?

1596
01:52:27,778 --> 01:52:31,339
- We got any communication established?
- I requested Hostage Negotiation, sir.

1597
01:52:31,515 --> 01:52:33,813
They give you an ETA?
- Not yet, sir.

1598
01:52:33,984 --> 01:52:37,579
All right.
I want this perimeter pushed back.

1599
01:52:37,755 --> 01:52:40,724
Big Stevie, Ponch, you're my shooters.

1600
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:44,855
I'm going in.

1601
01:52:45,362 --> 01:52:46,886
Boss.

1602
01:52:47,064 --> 01:52:49,157
These are my guys.

1603
01:52:49,467 --> 01:52:50,900
I'm going in.

1604
01:53:01,812 --> 01:53:04,406
Where is everybody? Get over there!

1605
01:53:04,582 --> 01:53:06,413
Let's go, move it!

1606
01:53:06,584 --> 01:53:09,348
Fuck, man. Come on, hurry up.

1607
01:53:14,825 --> 01:53:18,192
They knocked my tooth out. Black and blue.
My whole family disrespected.

1608
01:53:18,362 --> 01:53:20,489
These motherfuckers!

1609
01:53:28,739 --> 01:53:31,606
Whoa. Whoa, man, easy.

1610
01:53:31,775 --> 01:53:33,936
Kenny, easy.

1611
01:53:34,111 --> 01:53:36,011
Let's not lose our heads here.

1612
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:37,704
I'm gonna fucking kill him, boss.

1613
01:53:37,882 --> 01:53:41,215
Kenny, just keep it calm, all right?
It's just me.

1614
01:53:41,585 --> 01:53:43,849
Get them motherfuckers out of here!
It's on.

1615
01:53:44,455 --> 01:53:47,947
I swear to Jesus Christ,
I will fucking kill him, Franny.

1616
01:53:53,697 --> 01:53:56,325
In about two minutes,
we got everybody showing up here.

1617
01:53:56,500 --> 01:54:00,231
You do not want that to happen. You do not
want me to lose control of this scene.

1618
01:54:00,404 --> 01:54:02,929
Do not fucking play me, Franny.

1619
01:54:03,107 --> 01:54:06,736
There's no play here, Kenny.
There's no fucking play.

1620
01:54:07,478 --> 01:54:10,413
You wanna talk to me or
you wanna talk to a stranger?

1621
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:13,674
Kenny.

1622
01:54:14,218 --> 01:54:16,049
Open the door.

1623
01:54:47,751 --> 01:54:50,777
Police. I want everyone
out of this bar right now.

1624
01:54:53,924 --> 01:54:55,721
You too, Mac.

1625
01:55:17,481 --> 01:55:20,609
You got anything you wanna say to me
about what you've done?

1626
01:55:22,119 --> 01:55:24,451
You left me no choice, Ray.

1627
01:55:24,955 --> 01:55:28,015
Push to shove, it's me and mine.
It's Megan and the kids.

1628
01:55:28,359 --> 01:55:30,850
After that, it's every swinging dick
for himself.

1629
01:55:31,095 --> 01:55:33,757
You broke our fucking hearts, Jimmy.

1630
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,798
Lot of hearts broken, Ray.

1631
01:55:41,071 --> 01:55:42,766
There's a lot of hearts broken.

1632
01:55:51,181 --> 01:55:53,376
So how do you think this ends?

1633
01:55:57,154 --> 01:55:58,348
You gonna take me in?

1634
01:55:59,690 --> 01:56:01,988
Take your gun out and put it on the bar.

1635
01:57:27,945 --> 01:57:29,936
Turn on me, Ray!

1636
01:57:30,114 --> 01:57:34,517
- I'm so fucking tired.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

1637
01:58:13,223 --> 01:58:17,523
I'm gonna send in a crew! Open it up!
Let's go, let's go!

1638
01:58:53,997 --> 01:58:56,022
Back! Everybody step back.

1639
01:58:59,803 --> 01:59:01,498
You gotta push these guys back.

1640
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,334
Ray. Ray.
- Shut up, Jimmy.

1641
01:59:32,503 --> 01:59:34,596
- Move. Move.
- Ray.

1642
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:38,467
That's him. That's that nigga Egan. Go.

1643
01:59:38,642 --> 01:59:40,303
- Get behind me.
- Take the cuffs off.

1644
01:59:40,477 --> 01:59:42,570
- Shut up. Get behind me.
- Yo, that's him!

1645
01:59:42,746 --> 01:59:46,978
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Right there. Police
officer. Stay back. This man's under arrest.

1646
01:59:47,150 --> 01:59:49,414
Take the cuffs off, give me my gun.
- Shut up.

1647
01:59:49,586 --> 01:59:51,554
We want Egan, not you.
Walk away, you live.

1648
01:59:51,722 --> 01:59:53,417
Fuck you! Stay back.

1649
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:55,558
- I'm not kidding.
- You gonna kill everybody?

1650
01:59:55,726 --> 01:59:57,591
Try me.
- They're gonna tear us apart.

1651
01:59:57,761 --> 02:00:01,219
- This ain't your fight.
- That nigga's dead. Give me that stick.

1652
02:00:01,398 --> 02:00:03,662
You walk out with me right now.
Let's go.

1653
02:00:06,336 --> 02:00:07,496
Jimmy!

1654
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:11,930
Let him be. Let him be.

1655
02:00:12,109 --> 02:00:13,542
- You motherfuckers!
- Back off!

1656
02:00:13,710 --> 02:00:14,938
Jimmy!
- Back the fuck off!

1657
02:00:15,112 --> 02:00:16,511
Jimmy!
Back off!

1658
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:18,705
Back off! Nigga's mine.
This nigga's mine!

1659
02:00:18,882 --> 02:00:22,818
Get off of me, you motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!

1660
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:26,380
No! Don't you do it!
Don't you fucking do it!

1661
02:00:27,324 --> 02:00:28,814
Tell her I love her.

1662
02:00:28,992 --> 02:00:31,961
Don't you fucking do it! No! Jimmy!

1663
02:00:32,129 --> 02:00:34,893
No! No! Don't fucking do it!

1664
02:00:35,065 --> 02:00:36,362
Don't you do it!

1665

You all right?
