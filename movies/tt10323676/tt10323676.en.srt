00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,889
<i>In the church,</i>

4
00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:54,158
<i>we often don't know
how to relate to</i>

5
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:58,428
<i>friends or... or family members
who are struggling.</i>

6
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:03,566
<i>That means a lot of people,
even in our church,</i>

7
00:01:04,634 --> 00:01:06,803
<i>feel really alone.</i>

8
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:09,773
So let's show them our love

9
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:14,979
and send these boys off
in the embrace of God's love.

10
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:18,916
Joe Lee, Michael Randolph
and Benjamin Ellis.

11
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,517
Come on.

12
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,851
Yeah. That's right.

13
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:25,022
Gentlemen, please
join me up here on stage.

14
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:30,988
<i>We pray, dear Lord,</i>

15
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:33,124
<i>for those that wield
the swords so that...</i>

16
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:35,926
<i>that righteousness
may triumph</i>

17
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,595
<i>and wrongdoings
may be vanquished.</i>

18
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:42,166
<i>For these men
are our protectors.</i>

19
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,436
Lord, please
comfort their families

20
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:47,537
while these men
are deployed.

21
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,609
Bestow special grace
upon all these children.

22
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:57,448
May God bless you
and protect you.

23
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,452
And may God bless America.
Amen.

24
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:02,887
Amen.

25
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:33,037
Sorry.
I didn't want to wake you up.

26
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,039
That's all right.
I was already awake.

27
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:39,809
How's training going?

28
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:45,683
Do we have time
for night sex or no?

29
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,418
I think he's awake.

30
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,286
Doesn't he have school today?

31
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,521
No, it's Saturday.

32
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:53,224
Aren't they
in school on Saturdays?

33
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:54,892
Not since 1953.

34
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:58,062
I liked 1953 a lot. It's a great year.

35
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:00,863
Want to say hi to Dad?

36
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,969
Hi.

37
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,937
- Hey, Dad.
- What you got there?

38
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:10,307
Oh, look at that.

39
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:11,976
- That's you in the airplane.
- Mm-hmm.

40
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:13,377
And those are the clouds.

41
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,213
He's been working on that
all week for you.

42
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,116
That's incredible.

43
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:29,093
Give us a hand. Okay.
Come on.

44
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:43,607
- Jack? Jack?
- I'm right behind you, Dad.

45
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:46,243
- Jack? Jack?
- Dad, I'm right here.

46
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:48,979
Come on. You got this.

47
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:50,581
I believe in you.

48
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:52,182
I'm gonna be right here,
okay?

49
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:55,286
If you need anything,
I'm gonna be right here.

50
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:10,000
All right. You ready?

51
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,769
- No.
- Yeah, you are.

52
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:13,237
No. Please don't leave me.

53
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,871
I'm not leaving you.
I'm right here.

54
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:17,408
Jack, look at me.

55
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,045
Three... two... one.

56
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,180
Now, let go, son.
Swim to me.

57
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:25,282
- No.
- You've got this.

58
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:28,118
That's it. Let go.
Eyes on me.

59
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:29,852
Use your feet.

60
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:31,221
That's it!
You're swimming, Jack.

61
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:33,223
You're swimming. Come on!

62
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,027
You're doing it, Jack.
You're swimming. Come on!

63
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:39,563
You did good, son.

64
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:41,598
Mom! I did it!

65
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:42,966
- Yeah, you did.
- I did it!

66
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,170
Dad, I think I can swim now.
Look.

67
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:53,344
Again!

68
00:07:58,048 --> 00:07:59,283
Look at that.

69
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,018
An inch in seven months.

70
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:03,687
An inch in seven months.
How about that?

71
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:06,924
- Is that enough?
- That's a lot. That's perfect.

72
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,104
<i>Hi, this is Sheila
from Bills Recovery.</i>

73
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:22,706
<i>I just wanna check in with
y'all on your past due paym...</i>

74

75
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:28,112
<i>Hey, James. Listen, man,
I'm sorry to ruin your weekend,</i>

76
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:30,514
<i>but the CO is testing
the whole team.</i>

77
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:32,583
<i>Uh, you better get down here.</i>

78
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:48,098
<i>Army Sergeant
First Class James Harper.</i>

79
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:07,151
At ease, Sergeant.

80
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:09,987
This is our new CO,
Lieutenant Colonel Roberts.

81
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:14,758
Knee was shredded. Again.

82
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:18,562
- Great job with the rehab.
- Thank you, sir.

83
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:21,665
Your lung precludes high altitude
or underwater operations.

84
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:27,704
I've done four combat rotations
in five years with that lung, sir.

85
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,108
You can relax,
Sergeant Harper.

86
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:36,947
Blood work came back
filthy with Stanozolol,

87
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,350
Nandrolone,
phenylpropionate and HGH.

88
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:43,888
You're an SOF medical sergeant.

89
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,622
Should have known better.

90
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:48,559
I wanted to stay on the team, sir.
I wanted to stay on the team.

91
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:50,895
I have no idea what
your previous COs encouraged,

92
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:53,464
but I won't accept that
in my unit.

93
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:56,166
Big Army recommended a revocation
of your Special Forces tab.

94
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,604
And although I disagree with your
choices, I'm not going to do that.

95
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:02,773
You're leaving the army
with an honorable discharge,

96
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:06,376
but you're losing your benefits,
which include your pension and health care.

97
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:08,679
Dismissed.

98
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,659
James.

99
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:26,430
- You don't have to say anything.
- Look. They're cleaning house.

100
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:29,266
- You made it easy for them.
- I'll own up. I understand.

101
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,635
With your rep,

102
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:34,571
every private's gonna be hitting on
you the second you walk off post.

103
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:01,900
I took shit for my knee. They
found it in my blood. That's what it was.

104
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:04,401
So that's it?
And there's nothing you can do?

105
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:05,769
Mm-mmm.

106
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:08,338
So, they just basically made
up a new bullshit rule...

107
00:11:08,472 --> 00:11:09,640
- They didn't make up a...
- Test...

108
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:11,275
No, they didn't make up
any bullshit.

109
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:12,944
You said they haven't
tested anybody in years.

110
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:14,879
They haven't tested anyone in years.
But it's legal.

111
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:18,315
It's the new CO that has a
fucking hard-on for just...

112
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:20,417
I don't know,
he just wants to clear house.

113
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:23,420
That's what the captain told me.
They wanna clear house.

114
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:28,325
What's this?

115
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,228
It's, um, debt collectors.

116
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:32,663
But I already
talked to them.

117
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:36,166
And, uh, they said they
could help us with a plan.

118
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,636
What's the interest rate
on it?

119
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,305
It's 18%.

120
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:47,144
Yeah. There is... There's real
work out there with real money.

121
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:49,813
- Private contracting?
- Yeah.

122
00:11:51,415 --> 00:11:52,649
- Mm-mmm.
- Why not?

123
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:54,117
No. You said you weren't
gonna do that...

124
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,620
I know what I said.
I know what I said.

125
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,425
No.

126
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:03,827
Mm-mmm.

127
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:13,403
I love you.

He's down for the count.

00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,342
- What?
- What are you doing on the roof in the middle of the night?

160
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,646
I'm fixing the roof.

161
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:11,755
I'm okay.

162
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:14,391
I'm just...

163
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:18,328
That's exactly
what Mason said to Suzanne.

164
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:21,231
I'm really fucking scared.

165
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:25,368
I'm not my father.

166
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:35,605
He would've hated this.

167
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,943
The ceremony or dying?

168
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,811
Just being fat and ugly.

169
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:46,184
How do you figure they shoved
his giant butt into that grave?

170
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:47,551
He's wearing a thong.

171
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,531
How'd he do it?

172
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:03,567
What do you mean?

173
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:06,803
He died in his sleep.

174
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:09,673
The family get full payout?

175
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:10,841
Full payout.

176
00:16:11,408 --> 00:16:12,776
That's good.

177
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:16,613
- Why don't you come over for dinner?
- No.

178
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,249
You haven't seen
the new house.

179
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:22,153
You're coming to dinner.
You're as moody as he was fat.

180
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:23,955
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

181
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,331
Yeah.

182
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:35,333
Good to see you.
Glad you're here.

183
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:38,602
Appreciate it.
You have a beautiful home.

184
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:41,638
Hey, bud.
How's it going?

185
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,840
You wanna play a video game?

186
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:47,477
When do I... When do I not wanna
play a video game? Look at this.

187
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:49,080
- Hey.
- The White Sox.

188
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:50,513
- Yeah.
- Nice.

189
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:53,017
- I love the White Sox.
- Yeah. Apparently.

190
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,920
- What? I like the White Sox.
- Hey, Kelly.

191
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:57,487
Hi, Uncle James.

192
00:16:58,455 --> 00:16:59,891
You got that?

193
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:02,592
You gonna give me a tour,
or should I just get a map?

194
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:05,129
I guess so.

195
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:06,463
Watch this.

196
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:08,732
Yeah? Well, watch this.

197
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,736
- Really good arm.
- Roger Clemens over here.

198
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:18,508
Thank you for this meal

199
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:22,479
and thank you for bringing
Uncle James back safely.

200
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:24,514
Amen.

201
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:26,884
- Amen.
- Amen.

202
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:31,788
Who was a better
soldier, you or my dad?

203
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:35,359
Well, uh, your dad
was my chief, so...

204
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:36,559
Careful.

205
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:39,529
I was his superior.

206
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:41,899
- Oh.
- But we were, uh...

207
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:45,669
How would you say?
We looked after each other.

208
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:47,939
Oh, kinda like brothers.

209
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:50,874
Yeah,
kinda like brothers. Uh...

210
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,610
Is it true you actually
saved my dad's life?

211
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:56,948
No. Yes.

212
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:01,751
Once. He pulled me
out of a bar once.

213
00:18:01,886 --> 00:18:03,220
Yeah, he was a wreck.

214
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:04,788
Your father
was an absolute wreck.

215
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:06,924
I hate to break it to you
this early.

216
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:09,526
- I... No.
- Bummer.

217
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:14,631
Well, uh, Mikey loves baseball.
He'll never play.

218
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:17,034
He's fighting it. He's...

219
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:19,669
No quit in his DNA.

220
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:21,771
There's no beating it.

221
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:27,510
Well, best case, he'll need special
care for the rest of his life.

222
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,251
How are you doing?

223
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:36,853
Good. Yeah, good.

224
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:38,389
- Yeah.
- You?

225
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:41,558
Yeah, good. I mean, sure.

226
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,163
You don't fall off the grid for two
months if you're good. What's up?

227
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:51,801
What do you look forward to?

228
00:18:56,873 --> 00:18:58,909
Watching my kids grow up.

229
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:01,711
Seeing 'em smile.

230
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,517
Making sure they're set.
Giving them the things I didn't have.

231
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,723
I gotta get my shit straight.

232
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:22,166
There's help.

233
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:28,172
No. Kill any operational future?
No, not a chance.

234
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:32,609
Privates contacted me.

235
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:33,944
- Good.
- Yeah.

236
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:36,347
Yeah. No, fuck yeah.
You deserve a paycheck.

237
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,417
- Bank is on my ass, and I just...
- Hell yeah. Take it.

238
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,385
I pulled a couple
of cowboy tours.

239
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,489
You know, banked some decent cash,
put a down payment on the house.

240
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:49,692
Cash is real.
You know, five, six a day.

241
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,763
Bonuses, you know,
it adds up.

242
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:56,067
It's okay to cash in.

243
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,136
You know,
it's pure fuckin' Darwin out here.

244
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:04,108
And we are trained to be
ruthlessly adaptable. Use it.

245
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,312
We're all just mercenaries
in the end.

246
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:15,618
So what do you got going now?
Is it JSOC? Agency?

247
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:17,488
Uh, in between.

248
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,891
It doesn't pay as good as private,
but it's legit NatSec work.

249
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:23,894
He's one of us.
Good people. Rock-solid.

250
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:25,229
How much?

251
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:27,131
Oh, 350.

252
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:35,738
Can you get me in?

253
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:38,442
Fucking hero?
President shook your hand.

254
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:40,144
Fuck off.
He shakes a lot of hands.

255
00:20:40,277 --> 00:20:42,346
They pulled my clearances
because of blood work.

256
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,349
At this level, as long
as you're good to go,

257
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:48,385
Rusty doesn't care
what you put in your body.

258
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:52,089
I'm in.

259
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:54,425
- Is that what you want?
- That's what I want.

260
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,027
I'm broke, Mike.
I need this.

261
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:00,898
I'll send your name up.

262
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:03,733
Yeah.

263
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,369
All right.
I'll set up a meet.

264
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:07,770
Yeah. Thanks.

265
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:10,341
Of course.

266
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,394
- What's up, fellas?
- Hey, man.

267
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:05,663
This is James, old running mate of mine.
Where is he?

268
00:22:05,795 --> 00:22:08,731
You know where he's at. Why don't you
give us a hand every once in a while?

269
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:13,237
<i>♪ From boys' home to boys' home
Till I was 18 ♪</i>

270
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:20,277
Yo, Chief.
Got anything tasty for me?

271
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:28,619
Like fucking candy.

272
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:30,321
Hmm, Cherokee Purple.

273
00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:33,490
It's an honor to meet you.

274
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:35,192
Thank you, sir.

275
00:22:35,326 --> 00:22:39,096
You can cut the "sir" crap.
My name is Rusty, Rusty Jennings.

276
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:39,964
Thanks, Mike.

277
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:42,132
Hey, you mind grabbing my boots?

278
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:45,269
Hey, Dave.

279
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:47,504
You want a beer?

280
00:22:47,638 --> 00:22:48,973
I'm good, thank you.

281
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:53,843
Thank you.

282
00:22:57,747 --> 00:22:59,483
Mike's the best
I ever worked with.

283
00:23:01,285 --> 00:23:03,921
He says you're the best
he's ever worked with.

284
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:11,528
Yeah. Well, he, uh...
He taught me everything I know.

285
00:23:11,662 --> 00:23:16,433
Our reputation is the only
commodity we got left in this game.

286
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:22,072
You reading my story?

287
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,309
Yours, mine, Mike's, Mason's.

288
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:28,379
It's all the same fucking story.
Shit, even your father's.

289
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,181
My father has nothing
to do with this.

290
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:33,284
Due respect.

291
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:37,955
And due respect...
sure he does.

292
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:46,230
We gave them our minds,
our bodies and our spirit.

293
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:51,969
And they chewed us up
and spit us out.

294
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:56,106
Left us with fear,
rage, uncertainty,

295
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,210
disillusionment,
a sense of abandonment, betrayal.

296
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:02,946
And finally,
self-loathing and guilt.

297
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,818
As if somehow, everything that happened
to us was our own goddamn fault.

298
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:15,225
I know exactly
where you are right now, son.

299
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:19,229
I was you.

300
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:21,899
Hell, we all were.

301
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:24,401
That's why we started
our own tribe.

302
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,109
I know you got options
in front of you.

303
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:36,046
And if you're looking
for a big payday,

304
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,881
the top tiers
can give it to you.

305
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:43,020
Triple Canopy, Aegis and that
soulless fuck-pig, Erik Prince.

306
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:45,456
But I need you to hear me

307
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,525
'cause I mean this.

308
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:52,062
The stink from those gigs,
it will rub off on you.

309
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,135
So what is it that you do?

310
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:01,405
You offer up
something different or what?

311
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:02,573
Damn straight.

312
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,543
I can give you a real home,
honorable work.

313
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:09,747
No corporate interest,
no babysitting billionaires, no bullshit.

314
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,350
We operate with direct presidential
authority under Title 50.

315
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:15,853
Deal strictly with matters
of national security.

316
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:18,055
A deep black OGA offshoot.

317
00:25:19,123 --> 00:25:21,091
Title 50. I know those guys.

318
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,260
We worked together
downrange.

319
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:26,630
We import and export coffee.

320
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,870
Man, what you did in uniform,
sledgehammer shit.

321
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:35,739
Our thing, scalpel work.

322
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:39,376
High-speed, low drag,
fangs only come out when they have to.

323
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:45,082
There's a situation in Berlin that
threatens our national security.

324
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,051
The team led by Mike
will be fully black

325
00:25:48,185 --> 00:25:50,354
since our presence
is not approved.

326
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:51,488
How long?

327
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:53,924
Two weeks. Three, tops.

328
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:57,594
So what do you say?
You down for the cause?

329
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:01,565
Yeah. For sure.

330
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:04,401
Excellent. Mike and Dalton will
walk you through the paperwork.

331
00:26:04,535 --> 00:26:06,403
In the meantime,
Brianne and Jack obviously...

332
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:09,072
Uh, what do they have to do
with this?

333
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:13,310
Well, when you get back,

334
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:15,779
be nice if we all got together
and broke some bread.

335
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:18,315
But for now, Dalton's gonna
cut you a check for 50K.

336
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:21,718
So you're not sweating them
while you're working with us.

337
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:25,456
Thank you.

338
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:39,670
- Hey.
- Hi.

339
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:41,538
Mmm.

340
00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:44,341
Why was your phone off?

341
00:26:47,211 --> 00:26:48,645
I got a job.

342
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:51,048
You got a job?

343
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:54,651
What kind of job did you get?

344
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:09,132
That kind of job.

345
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:13,537
It's babysitting corporates.

346
00:27:16,206 --> 00:27:17,241
It's not dangerous.

347
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,042
Don't tell me that.

348
00:27:19,176 --> 00:27:20,511
Now I know you're lying.

349
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:24,181
No, I'm not.
Look at me. I'm not.

350
00:27:26,316 --> 00:27:29,319
Baby, I need to take care of my family.

351
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:35,292
You're gonna
miss Jack's birthday.

352
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:41,758
Flight departs in eight hours.

353
00:29:22,232 --> 00:29:24,267
It take you longer
than 15 minutes to get here?

354
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:26,269
Only took me eight.

355
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:34,177
Salim Mohsin, 42.
Professor Emeritus of virology.

356
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:36,613
Humboldt-Universität, Berlin.

357
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:38,749
He lectures there
a few times a month,

358
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:40,952
but his primary focus
is research work

359
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:45,856
which is conducted at a private
laboratory 40 kilometers east of town.

360
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,691
Threat level?

361
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:50,327
It's bioterrorism.
Category A.

362
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:57,601
Car is in the parking lot.
Fiat Tipo.

363
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:19,316
The results are incredible.

364
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:22,422
We need to protect them though.

365
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:24,821
I suspect someone at our branch.

366
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:25,635
<i>Damn it!</i>

367
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:27,713
We are all in danger.

368
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:05,522
Salim?

369
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,234
Wakey-wakey,
eggs and bakey.

370
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:26,870
Time to wake up.

371
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:39,150
<i>Baseball cards stay here.</i>

372
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:44,989
Salim Mohamed Mohsin.
Age 42.

373
00:34:45,122 --> 00:34:47,992
Syrian descent.
6'1", 190 pounds.

374
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:51,461
Dyes his beard.
Heart-shaped birthmark behind his left ear.

375
00:34:51,594 --> 00:34:54,398
Round-shaped birthmark
on his right wrist.

376
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:58,202
Harvard Med. Graduates and
receives a federal research grant

377
00:34:58,336 --> 00:35:02,440
to study pathogenic
influenza viruses in humans.

378
00:35:02,572 --> 00:35:05,443
H1N1 and avian flu mutations.

379
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:08,012
His grant was not extended.

380
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:12,816
His family relocated here to Berlin
where he continued his research.

381
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,652
Financed by Farouk Ojjeh,

382
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:21,558
the founder of Al Dawaa, a charity
with known links to al-Qaeda and Syria.

383
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:22,826
This is a layout

384
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,528
annotated by our inside asset.

385
00:35:26,763 --> 00:35:28,966
The lab only has
moderate security presence

386
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,569
since the guard shack
is connected to Berlin police.

387
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:35,973
- What kind of doors are they?
- No idea.

388
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:39,276
- How are we breaching?
- Biometrics. Guard's thumb.

389
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,744
What happens
when we hit jackpot?

390
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:42,846
We conduct
a tactical interrogation,

391
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,117
then contact higher and wait
for further instruction.

392
00:35:48,852 --> 00:35:50,754
Exfil
back through the woods.

393
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:52,957
Link up with you here.

394
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,724
And then it's straight
to the airport.

395
00:35:54,858 --> 00:35:56,826
Plane will be ready
at Airfield Alpha.

396
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:59,430
We all know what one
motivated radical can do,

397
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:04,201
so let's cowboy-up, get it done
and go home to our families.

398
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:07,670
Giddyap.

399
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,553
- Go live.
- <i>Wolf Two.</i>

400
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:57,154
<i>Fox Three.</i>

401
00:36:57,288 --> 00:36:58,788
<i>Sierra One.</i>

00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,059
<i>Coyote One.</i>

403
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:13,003
<i>Get ready.</i>

404
00:38:43,826 --> 00:38:45,329
Seven minutes.

405
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:17,860
Up!

406
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:20,297
<i>Was ist das?</i>

407
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:22,366
Stand up.

408
00:39:30,274 --> 00:39:31,475
Six minutes.

409
00:39:34,645 --> 00:39:36,313
Need to ask you questions.

410
00:39:38,582 --> 00:39:40,317
Who has access to the lab?

411
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:44,688
Oh. Only me.
I have access. It's...

412
00:39:44,821 --> 00:39:46,490
Maggie Bolevska.

413
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:49,426
Y-Yeah. She's my...

414
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,895
She's my research assistant.
She has access.

415
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:54,064
Who else knows the specifics
of your work?

416
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:56,367
Nobody. Who are you people?

417
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,002
Your financier?

418
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:01,739
Y-Yeah, he knows about my work,
but he...

419
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,975
He's not a scientist. He's a...
He's an investor. He's...

420
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:07,344
Where do you back up your work?

421
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:12,116
There's another team on standby
a block away from your family.

422
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:15,753
Cooperate. There is no limit
to what we are authorized to do.

423
00:40:15,886 --> 00:40:17,988
Where do you
back up your work?

424
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:21,592
It's all in here.
It's in these computers.

425
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:23,527
There are no lines in or out.

426
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:25,529
We got it. Payday.

427
00:40:25,663 --> 00:40:30,000
If it's money you want, I can arrange
money. It's really not a problem.

428
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:33,037
Head against the wall.

429
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,506
I mean... I can really...

430
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:43,514
Oh, shit.

431
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,316
Ears.

432
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,156
Sierra just got a hit
off the scanner.

433
00:40:53,424 --> 00:40:55,459
Police are inbound
from Berlin.

434
00:40:57,795 --> 00:41:00,230
Awaiting instructions
from the ranch.

435
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:05,369
Code X.

436
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:06,937
All the way?

437
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:08,539
All the way.

438
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:14,278
Industrial accident.
We got five minutes.

439
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:17,915
Bag the laptop. Lose the cuffs and hoods.
We were never here.

440
00:41:35,366 --> 00:41:36,467
Get Salim.

441
00:41:48,078 --> 00:41:52,750
Sir... Sir. Sir, please.
This whole thing is...

442
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:56,453
It's a misunderstanding.
I'm a... I'm a man of science.

443
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:59,990
This is... This is
a huge misunderstanding.

444
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:03,060
Sir! I'm a man of sci...

445
00:42:03,193 --> 00:42:06,864
I'm a man of science.
I have a family, please.

446
00:42:06,997 --> 00:42:08,699
Sir, please.
I have a family. Please.

447
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:13,036
No! No! No, no, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

448
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:15,072
Who sent you?

449
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:17,207
Do you even know
who you're working for?

450
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:19,309
You don't know
what you're doing.

451
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:21,779
Stop! Please, listen.

452
00:42:21,912 --> 00:42:25,482
The research I'm doing
will save millions of lives.

453
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:27,251
Stop!

454
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:28,919
Stop. Stop, please.

455
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:31,221
If you wanna say a prayer,
now is the time.

456
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:34,625
A prayer? I don't believe in God.
I believe in science.

457
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:37,428
Listen to me.

458
00:42:37,561 --> 00:42:40,297
I keep a copy of all my data
in a safety deposit box.

459
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:42,901
If you have a conscience,
get it out.

460
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:44,968
The world will need it.

461
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:48,639
Stop, stop.
Please, stop.

462
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:50,874
Please don't hurt
my family.

463
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:53,544
Don't hurt my family.
Stop. Please.

464
00:42:54,244 --> 00:42:56,980
Don't! Don't.

465
00:43:19,536 --> 00:43:22,039
Sierra One, RV in two.

466
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:24,241
<i>Copy.</i>

467
00:43:35,552 --> 00:43:37,588
We're in OT. Move out.

468
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:43,660
<i>Sierra One. One minute.</i>

469
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:07,551
- Fuck.
- <i>Cops, 9:00.</i>

470
00:44:07,684 --> 00:44:10,053
Halt! <i>Polizei!</i>

00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:20,497
<i>Move it!</i>

472
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:22,432

473
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:27,371
<i>On your left.</i>

<i>Fox Two is hit.</i>

00:44:44,288 --> 00:44:45,522
Suppression.

476
00:44:53,163 --> 00:44:55,599
- The bag. Throw it to me.
- Copy.

477
00:44:55,732 --> 00:44:57,301
Throw it to me.

478
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:00,070
Fuck.

479
00:45:00,203 --> 00:45:01,805
Fox Two down.

480
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,774
Cover fire.

481
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,445
Fuck.

482
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,986
Status?

483
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:16,888
Left leg.

484
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:18,755
New contact!

485
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:30,267
Sierra's hit.

486
00:45:32,836 --> 00:45:35,238
Put her down!

487
00:45:41,244 --> 00:45:43,413
Let's get out of here.

488
00:45:59,229 --> 00:46:02,699
Come on. Let's go.

489
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,669
Fuck!

490
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:24,187
My knee is fucked.

491
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:27,391
I'm gonna have to set you down.
Ah, fuck!

492
00:46:32,396 --> 00:46:34,398
Dump the gear,
save the drive.

493
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:43,674
I got you.
Come on, come on.

494
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:17,801
We shot cops.

495
00:48:21,906 --> 00:48:23,673
Did what we had to do.

496
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:27,945
Is the laptop secure?

497
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,046
It's secure.

498
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:33,383
We got the laptop.
Mission first.

499
00:48:34,952 --> 00:48:38,388
I have to give you blood.
Confirm A-pos?

500
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:40,390
A-pos.

501
00:48:40,524 --> 00:48:43,094
One of us
has to walk this in.

502
00:48:43,227 --> 00:48:45,428
If you don't get blood,
you're gonna die.

503
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:47,597
You bring it in.

504
00:48:47,731 --> 00:48:49,833
Fuck you. I'm not leaving you.

505
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:53,637
My family.

506
00:48:54,906 --> 00:48:57,008
I want Christine
to hear about me from you.

507
00:48:57,141 --> 00:49:00,410
You tell 'em yourself, Mike.
You're gonna tell 'em yourself.

508
00:49:00,544 --> 00:49:02,280
I want it to be you.

509
00:49:10,854 --> 00:49:13,490
I'm gonna get us home.
You hear me?

510
00:49:45,755 --> 00:49:49,961
<i>With us now to shed more light

<i>Thanks for having me on, Erica.</i>

did you carry me out?

519

So what's the plan?

520
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:29,166
We get the laptop home.
Let's get paid. Let's have a beer.

521
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,533
Roger that.

I'm down.
You take it in.

523
00:50:48,485 --> 00:50:49,686
No, no. We go together.

524
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:52,089
I'll compromise
the mission.

525
00:50:52,957 --> 00:50:54,591
We don't know
what's in that bag.

526
00:50:54,724 --> 00:50:57,827
Get it home. You go.
I'll catch up.

527
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,133
I'll make contact.
I'll come back.

528
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:05,735
Yeah.
Back to the Four Seasons of Tunnels?

529
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:08,005
Come on. I'll be fine.

530
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:10,975
I'll move in the dark.
I just need 24 hours to rest up.

531
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:17,614
Get the fuck outta here.

532
00:51:26,823 --> 00:51:28,725
Yeah.

533
00:51:35,732 --> 00:51:37,500
- I head to Berlin.
- Mmm.

534
00:51:37,634 --> 00:51:38,735
- Hand this off.
- Mmm.

535
00:51:38,868 --> 00:51:41,671
- Make contact. RV in 48.
- Forty-eight.

536
00:51:41,805 --> 00:51:44,741
Hotel Salvina.
I'm gonna get everything we need.

537
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:46,543
Forty-eight.

538
00:51:46,676 --> 00:51:48,279
Capture's not an option.

539
00:51:48,412 --> 00:51:50,147
Not an option.

540
00:52:27,684 --> 00:52:32,023
I swim out until I start
to wonder if I can make it back.

541
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:10,287
James!

542
00:54:11,788 --> 00:54:13,190
Come on!

543
00:54:13,656 --> 00:54:15,292
Get back here, son.

544
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:22,792
- <i>Hallo.</i>
- <i>Willkommen.</i>

545
00:55:23,527 --> 00:55:25,496
Uh, Ketner.

546
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:26,997
<i>Reisepass, bitte.</i>

547
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:28,966
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

548
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:33,083
Your friend has already
checked in and paid for the room.

549
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:34,338
<i>Ja.</i>

550
00:55:36,347 --> 00:55:38,225
- It's room 210.
- Mmm.

551
00:55:38,296 --> 00:55:40,391
- Enjoy your stay!
- <i>Danke schoen.</i>

552
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:48,085
Today, we think about the families

553
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:50,541
of the dead policemen

554
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:54,841
who, in a suspected terrorist attack,

555
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,213
lost their lives.

556
00:56:57,285 --> 00:57:00,021
Our prayers go out to their families...

557
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:06,070
<i>Hallo?</i>

558
00:57:06,113 --> 00:57:08,278
Good morning.
Is there a message for me?

559
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:09,685
No, nothing I'm afraid.

560
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:12,069
<i>Danke.</i>

561
00:57:16,974 --> 00:57:18,442
Where the hell are you?

562
00:57:58,816 --> 00:58:00,017
- <i>Hallo.</i>
- Hi.

563
00:58:00,156 --> 00:58:01,278
I would like to buy a phone.

564
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,750
- Which one do you want?
- That one.

565
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:04,498
Also a SIM card.

566
00:58:09,993 --> 00:58:11,261
This is Rusty. Go.

567
00:58:12,229 --> 00:58:14,198
I'm on a burner.
It's not secure.

568
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:15,999
Copy that.

569
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:18,268
We don't have a choice.
Physical condition?

570
00:58:18,936 --> 00:58:21,071
Compromised
but not critical.

571
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:24,041
Did Wolf Two make contact?

572
00:58:24,174 --> 00:58:26,110
<i>Wolf Two</i>
<i>never made it to Berlin.</i>

573
00:58:26,243 --> 00:58:29,646
<i>I've got an extraction team en route to
the hotel, get you over to the airfield.</i>

574
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,548
Confirm location.

575
00:58:36,887 --> 00:58:38,322
Hey, stay with me.
Confirm location.

576
00:58:38,455 --> 00:58:40,557
<i>I'll do that</i>
<i>when you brief me on Wolf Two.</i>

577
00:58:42,459 --> 00:58:45,162
<i>You'll get a full brief</i>
<i>when you're secure.</i>

578
00:58:45,295 --> 00:58:48,732
<i>Right now everything is extremely
fubar, and we are highly exposed.</i>

579
00:58:48,866 --> 00:58:51,635
Listen to me. Everything I am
doing right now is to get you home.

580
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:53,670
Back to the ranch safe and sound.
You feel me?

581
00:58:53,804 --> 00:58:57,408
- Yes, sir. Of course.
- Then confirm your location.

582
00:58:58,242 --> 00:58:59,743
Alexanderplatz. Heavy police.

583
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:02,212
<i>Alexanderplatz.</i>
<i>Copy that. Stand by.</i>

584
00:59:03,046 --> 00:59:05,249
How long to reroute them
to the Elsen Bridge?

585
00:59:05,382 --> 00:59:06,817
Fifteen, 20.

586
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,619
I need you to start
heading for the water.

587
00:59:08,752 --> 00:59:12,556
<i>Down towards the Elsen Bridge.
Northwest corner. Fifteen, 20 minutes.</i>

588
00:59:42,252 --> 00:59:43,987
<i>This is Rusty. Go.</i>

589
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:48,091
I'm at the Elsen Bridge.
Northwest corner.

590
00:59:49,393 --> 00:59:52,296
<i>Brown BMW X1. Confirm.</i>

591
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,601
Confirm.

592
00:59:57,734 --> 00:59:59,369
<i>Copy that.</i>

593
01:00:12,549 --> 01:00:16,353
If Wolf Two didn't make it to
Berlin, how'd he arrange my exfil then?

594
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,822
Look, I understand.
Right now nothing makes sense.

595
01:00:19,723 --> 01:00:21,758
<i>But you gotta trust me.
I am trying to help you.</i>

596
01:00:21,893 --> 01:00:23,660
Same way you helped Mike?

597
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:27,664
You motherfucker.
Did you kill him?

598
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,168
Who are we working for?

599
01:00:33,337 --> 01:00:35,405
Stop acting like a child
and get in the fucking car.

600
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,774
<i>If this goes down,</i>
<i>I'm gonna come for you.</i>

601
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:39,476
Get in the fucking car.

602
01:00:39,978 --> 01:00:41,245
Fuck!

603
01:03:57,207 --> 01:03:58,709
You American?

604
01:04:00,577 --> 01:04:04,414
You're a fucking marine?

605
01:04:06,783 --> 01:04:07,885
Are you a marine?

606
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:11,822
Was. Recon.

607
01:04:15,993 --> 01:04:17,561
What was your mission?

608
01:04:18,096 --> 01:04:19,563
Extraction.

609
01:04:19,696 --> 01:04:22,299
Then the ranch
gave an audible.

610
01:04:22,432 --> 01:04:23,935
Terminate after pickup.

611
01:04:25,203 --> 01:04:26,503
When?

612
01:04:28,238 --> 01:04:30,440
On the bridge,
when I saw you.

613
01:04:30,574 --> 01:04:33,477
My partner,
you go after him? Huh?

614
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,784
I heard they picked him up.
I'm sorry.

615
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:44,922
They told us we'd be saving
lives, not killing our own.

616
01:04:46,256 --> 01:04:49,961
My...
...picture, please.

617
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:09,446
There is...
There's a safe house.

618
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:12,549
Use this code for pickup.

619
01:05:14,451 --> 01:05:15,852
Take my phone.

620
01:05:19,157 --> 01:05:21,291
You can never go home.

621
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,762
The kill code is Tomahawk.

622
01:05:27,731 --> 01:05:31,434
It'll stop the team,
at least for a while.

623
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,408
Rusty said
he'd make us all rich.

624
01:08:04,155 --> 01:08:05,455
<i>Kurier.</i>

625
01:08:08,259 --> 01:08:11,329
Yes?

626
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:13,130
- Shh.
- Who are you? What do you want?

627
01:08:13,663 --> 01:08:14,864
Who are you?

628
01:08:14,999 --> 01:08:16,599
I'm not here to hurt you
or your family.

629
01:08:16,733 --> 01:08:19,937
But if you don't answer
all of my questions, I will.

630
01:08:20,071 --> 01:08:24,607
Your husband secured his work
someplace safe. I need to know where.

631
01:08:25,343 --> 01:08:27,078
Sylvie, look at me.
Look at me.

632
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:33,516
For Yanis, for Olivier.
Tell me where.

633
01:08:34,718 --> 01:08:37,421
- Swiss Credit Bank.
- Swiss Credit Bank?

634
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:40,690
- Safe deposit box.
- Safe deposit box.

635
01:08:40,824 --> 01:08:42,893
Don't hurt my son.

636
01:08:43,027 --> 01:08:45,997
Shh, just breathe.
It's gonna be fine.

637
01:08:46,931 --> 01:08:49,233
- Tell him to get ready.
- Yes.

638
01:08:49,367 --> 01:08:53,570
You tell him I'm an old friend of his
dad's, and we're going out for lunch.

639
01:08:59,477 --> 01:09:00,448
Yanis.

640
01:09:00,497 --> 01:09:01,787
Get ready, sweetie.

641
01:09:01,897 --> 01:09:05,103
We're having lunch
with one of your dad's friends.

642
01:09:06,283 --> 01:09:07,885
Let's go.

643
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:40,518
He's coming with me.

644
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:42,420
We'll be here
when you get back.

645
01:09:46,366 --> 01:09:47,624
Wait for me, please.

646
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:10,948
You were his friend?

647
01:10:16,487 --> 01:10:18,055
Yes.

648
01:10:20,757 --> 01:10:22,359
Are you sad?

649
01:10:25,595 --> 01:10:26,964
Yes.

650
01:10:28,765 --> 01:10:30,134
Me too.

651
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,703
Where did you meet?

652
01:11:07,271 --> 01:11:08,372
Paris.

653
01:11:10,707 --> 01:11:12,943
Where was your first child born?

654
01:11:15,045 --> 01:11:17,081
- I was born...
- <i>Tais-toi!</i>

655
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,218
I have two boys to raise.

656
01:11:22,086 --> 01:11:24,854
Everything we have
is in your hands.

657
01:11:27,358 --> 01:11:28,858
Answer the question.

658
01:11:30,261 --> 01:11:35,266
Um...
Yanis was born in Boston.

659
01:11:40,237 --> 01:11:43,174
What were you gonna call
your third child?

660
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,381
Jordan.

661
01:11:54,885 --> 01:11:56,120
Stop the car.

662
01:11:59,722 --> 01:12:02,293
So, how much
did they pay you, huh?

663
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,397
I hope it was worth it.

664
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:29,954
<i>Yes?</i>

665
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:34,091
Recon. 6-22-34. Mayday.

666
01:12:34,824 --> 01:12:36,193
<i>Copy. Location?</i>

667
01:12:36,327 --> 01:12:37,461
Berlin.

668
01:12:38,028 --> 01:12:39,163
<i>Condition?</i>

669
01:12:39,296 --> 01:12:40,830
Mobile.

670
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:46,803
<i>0300 tomorrow.</i>
<i>GPS 14.98, 51.150.</i>

671
01:13:05,155 --> 01:13:06,590
Are you lost?

672
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:12,129
Do you mind lowering the gun?

673
01:13:15,566 --> 01:13:17,167
You called me.

674
01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:23,040
It's the price
of admission.

675
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,095
There's no need
to fight anymore.

676
01:14:26,203 --> 01:14:28,305
Where's my bag?

677
01:14:41,418 --> 01:14:45,022
So... are we good?

678
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:10,080
It's okay.
You're safe here.

679
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:13,384
I cleaned your knee.
It was badly infected.

680
01:15:13,517 --> 01:15:17,054
You tore your ACL. I don't know
how you walked on it, but you did.

681
01:15:17,187 --> 01:15:19,323
The marine
who told me about you...

682
01:15:20,824 --> 01:15:22,059
You know him?

683
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,595
No.

684
01:15:26,196 --> 01:15:27,431
Did you kill him?

685
01:15:29,633 --> 01:15:34,004
No, but I know they train us to run their errands.

686
01:15:34,138 --> 01:15:36,507
Kill their enemies
and kill each other.

687
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,778
"National security." It's just a rock
they can hide their dirty shit under.

688
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,379
I need to get back.

689
01:15:42,513 --> 01:15:43,247
Back where?

690
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:46,049
Back home.

691
01:15:49,553 --> 01:15:51,088
That's done.

692
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,391
Home is a memory.

693
01:15:59,396 --> 01:16:02,032
You need... You almost died.

694
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:03,902
- Your body needs rest.
- I'm fine.

695
01:16:04,034 --> 01:16:06,036
- Shh. All right.
- I'm fine.

696
01:16:18,248 --> 01:16:22,252
<i>Yanis, in case I'm not
here to tell you this in person,</i>

697
01:16:22,986 --> 01:16:24,354
<i>I love you.</i>

698
01:16:24,488 --> 01:16:27,558
<i>I know you have felt my absence
these last few years.</i>

699
01:16:27,691 --> 01:16:29,293
<i>I need you to know why.</i>

700
01:16:29,426 --> 01:16:31,462
<i>I made up my mind very early</i>

701
01:16:31,595 --> 01:16:33,898
<i>that my children
would live without fear.</i>

702
01:16:34,031 --> 01:16:38,802
<i>And because of that,
I chose to dedicate my life to science.</i>

703
01:16:38,937 --> 01:16:42,206
<i>Unfortunately, there are powerful
people who ignore science,</i>

704
01:16:42,339 --> 01:16:45,275
<i>even subvert it
for their own personal gain.</i>

705
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:50,347
<i>Yanis, in your hands
is my life's work:</i>

706
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:55,486
<i>the vaccine for the H5N1 virus
with a mortality rate of 16%.</i>

707
01:16:58,121 --> 01:17:02,426
<i>It may have landed me in this chair, staring
into this camera instead of your eyes,</i>

708
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,096
<i>but I want you to know that
your father stood for something,</i>

709
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:08,765
<i>created something
that with your help</i>

710
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:13,170
<i>will benefit humanity long
after they've shot me down.</i>

711
01:17:13,303 --> 01:17:16,106
<i>It is very important
that this vaccine is available</i>

712
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,042
<i>free to the public
should the unthinkable happen.</i>

713
01:17:30,587 --> 01:17:34,157
<i>Dear Lord,</i>
<i>thank you for this meal</i>

714
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:36,827
and bringing my guest
here safely.

715
01:17:36,961 --> 01:17:39,964
Forgive us our sins and keep
us from the fires of hell.

716
01:17:40,097 --> 01:17:42,432
May our souls
go to heaven.

717
01:17:42,566 --> 01:17:46,303
Especially those in
need of thy mercy. Amen.

718
01:17:46,436 --> 01:17:47,538
Amen.

719
01:17:50,741 --> 01:17:54,678
Your tat. OD3224.

720
01:17:54,811 --> 01:17:56,446
That's tip of the spear.

721
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,748
Mmm.

722
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:01,351
Yeah,
they kept us busy.

723
01:18:02,452 --> 01:18:04,388
In Iraq or Afghanistan?

724
01:18:07,591 --> 01:18:08,759
Both.

725
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,800
You ever been
to Hindu Kush?

726
01:18:19,303 --> 01:18:22,372
Mountains so high,
you think heaven's resting on 'em.

727
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,809
The valleys so green,
you think it's Eden.

728
01:18:26,877 --> 01:18:29,680
I thought I was in Colorado
when I first saw it.

729
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,858
You know, we were
on a 12-day straight

730
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,562
looking for one of
our local guys' kid.

731
01:18:45,696 --> 01:18:49,633
Been gone... Gone hunting,
couldn't find him. Poor thing.

732
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:53,103
So we broke down a door
on this out-of-the-way compound,

733
01:18:53,236 --> 01:18:54,973
and then we burst in.

734
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:57,407
And once we cleared everything,
we found him, the kid.

735
01:18:57,541 --> 01:19:00,677
And he was chained to the wall,
just crying his eyes out.

736
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:04,715
But in the next room,
it's full of girls

737
01:19:04,848 --> 01:19:07,618
all strung out, splayed out.

738
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:11,321
And in the middle
of all this was a dog.

739
01:19:12,155 --> 01:19:13,690
It's just a little thing.

740
01:19:13,824 --> 01:19:16,193
Mangy. Happy as can be.

741
01:19:16,326 --> 01:19:19,396
Happy to see us.
All yelps and matted hair.

742
01:19:20,697 --> 01:19:25,469
And all that shit, and the thing
I remember the most is the dog.

743
01:19:27,204 --> 01:19:31,408
'Cause that dog survived all that
shit without even blinking an eye.

744
01:19:37,547 --> 01:19:39,483
It's much easier to kill,

745
01:19:40,717 --> 01:19:43,620
but it's harder to survive.

746
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,268
How long
you been out here?

747
01:19:59,703 --> 01:20:01,171
Thirteen years.

748
01:20:05,442 --> 01:20:06,877
You have a family?

749
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:10,313
Yeah, I've got a wife,
two beautiful girls,

750
01:20:11,214 --> 01:20:12,649
a nice house.

751
01:20:14,152 --> 01:20:15,585
You ever feel
like reaching out?

752
01:20:20,257 --> 01:20:21,893
When I reach out...

753
01:20:23,427 --> 01:20:25,262
I break things.

754
01:20:27,597 --> 01:20:29,566
We all know the monster.

755
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,669
And sometimes
he comes to stay.

756
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:44,548
How's the steak?

757
01:20:47,118 --> 01:20:48,351
I've had better.

758
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,822
So... So have I.

759
01:23:52,904 --> 01:23:54,171
Hi.

760
01:23:54,305 --> 01:23:56,473
- American?
- Yes.

761
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:00,945
Safe travels, sir.

762
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:35,812
<i>I want Christine</i>
<i>to hear about me from you.</i>

763
01:24:35,947 --> 01:24:39,616
<i>You tell 'em yourself, Mike.
Tell 'em yourself.</i>

764
01:25:14,885 --> 01:25:16,553
Motherfucker.

765
01:27:15,306 --> 01:27:16,773
Doing at my house?

766
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:20,177
Answer me.

767
01:27:21,145 --> 01:27:23,581
You wanna shoot me?

768
01:27:23,713 --> 01:27:26,884
Go ahead.

769
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:42,366
I went to your house to tell
Christine, like you asked me to.

770
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,302
- Rusty said...
- Did you know he was coming after me?

771
01:27:46,036 --> 01:27:47,670
He said you didn't make it.

772
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:48,906
Why did you lie to me?

773
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:50,874
- About what?
- Fuck you.

774
01:27:51,008 --> 01:27:53,843
A real home. A tribe.
Honorable work.

775
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:56,380
It was a data heist.
None of this was supposed to happen.

776
01:27:56,514 --> 01:27:58,449
But it did happen.
And for what?

777
01:27:58,582 --> 01:28:00,117
Payday of a lifetime.

778
01:28:03,888 --> 01:28:05,890
What we stole
was not data.

779
01:28:06,991 --> 01:28:09,460
It's a cure to a virus
these fuckers wanna release.

780
01:28:09,593 --> 01:28:13,898
So they can make billions off
people suffering. Did you know that?

781
01:28:15,798 --> 01:28:17,667
How do you fucking
live with yourself?

782
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,437
I got a family
and a son with special needs.

783
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:23,340
So what about my family?
My son! Their needs!

784
01:28:23,474 --> 01:28:25,075
Everything's taken care of.

785
01:28:25,209 --> 01:28:27,111
There's a huge payout to Brianne
and your boy. Four million.

786
01:28:27,244 --> 01:28:28,878
They'll never want
for anything ever again.

787
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:31,415
Except for me! Me!

788
01:28:31,549 --> 01:28:33,651
You can't go home!

789
01:28:33,783 --> 01:28:37,922
He finds out you're here, he's gonna
come after you with everything he's got.

790
01:28:41,592 --> 01:28:42,927
After everything
we've done,

791
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,428
everything
we've been through.

792
01:28:44,562 --> 01:28:46,763
I fucking bled for you!

793
01:28:48,465 --> 01:28:49,934
And this is what I get?

794
01:29:04,582 --> 01:29:07,017
James, don't do this.

795
01:29:07,952 --> 01:29:09,420
I'm sorry.

796
01:29:40,551 --> 01:29:42,852
My father, uh...

797
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,259
He branded me to be like him.

798
01:29:48,392 --> 01:29:53,163
You know, a fucking...
a fucking Ranger to the bone.

799
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,801
And when they cut him loose
and they cast him out,

800
01:29:58,936 --> 01:30:00,770
he just never came home.

801
01:30:07,344 --> 01:30:10,214
Vanished. No note, corpse.
Fucking nothing.

802
01:30:14,018 --> 01:30:19,023
I finally just buried all the... shit
the fucker ever gave me in the backyard.

803
01:30:19,156 --> 01:30:22,459
Had my own funeral.

804
01:30:23,694 --> 01:30:26,863
I'm standing over this pathetic
little hole filled with stupid shit.

805
01:30:26,997 --> 01:30:29,099
And I swore to myself
I would never be like him.

806
01:30:29,233 --> 01:30:33,170
I would never forsake my family.
Do you understand me?

807
01:30:37,408 --> 01:30:39,310
Rusty finds out you're here,

808
01:30:39,443 --> 01:30:41,512
he's gonna come
after your family.

809
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:44,814
There's only one way this ends.

810
01:31:34,164 --> 01:31:35,532
Hey, what's up, Mike?

811
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:37,735
You got a beer?
Where is he?

812
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:39,303
He's in the kitchen.

813
01:34:34,311 --> 01:34:37,447
Always wanted to die
with my boots on.

814
01:34:55,632 --> 01:34:58,769
I got a room
prepped and ready for ya.

815
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:01,572
We're going home, Mike.

816
01:35:04,508 --> 01:35:06,743
Put some fucking music on.

817
01:35:06,877 --> 01:35:07,946
Yeah.

818
01:35:13,650 --> 01:35:14,718
Cold.

819
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:28,398
Tell my s...

820
01:35:34,805 --> 01:35:38,208
My son...

821
01:35:42,579 --> 01:35:44,781
I didn't die in my sleep.

822
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:52,456
I promise.

823
01:35:55,059 --> 01:35:56,393
I got you.

824
01:36:46,376 --> 01:36:48,512
Yeah! Cannonball!

825
01:36:55,218 --> 01:36:56,453
Yeah!

826
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:58,689
Good job!

827
01:37:34,825 --> 01:37:36,226
Jack!

828
01:37:43,415 --> 01:37:48,415
