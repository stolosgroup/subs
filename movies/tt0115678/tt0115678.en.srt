It's delicious, I pr omi se,

20
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,188
It took so long I thought you went
back to Italy to get it,

21
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,063
I know, but it's worth it, I promise.

Th en with shrimp and scallop and...

26
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,911
I don't see anything that looks lik e
a shri mp or scall op,

27
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,521
I mean, it's just not
wh at I expected.

28

But I get spaghetti with thi s,

29
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,223
Wh y? Well, no,

30
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,528
I thought all mai n cou rses
come with spaghetti.

31
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,833
Some yes. But you see,
ri sotto is rice, so it is a star ch,

32
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,739
And it doesn't go r eally
with pasta,

33
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,277
Honey, order a side of spagh etti,

Well, the spagh etti comes
without meatballs,

36
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,782
There ar e no meatball s
with the spaghetti?

37
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,016
No, Someti mes spaghetti lik es
to be alone.

38
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,850
Then I guess we'll also have
a side or der of meatballs.
