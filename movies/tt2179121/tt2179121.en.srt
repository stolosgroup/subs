OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:50,605
WHAT'S IN A NAME

3
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,872
Bursting from this dark tunnel
is Jean-Jacques.

4
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:33,391
Jean-Jacques is lucky.
He isn't superstitious.

5
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,796
He can walk under ladders,
open an umbrella at home...

6
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,967
after a rain or see black cats,
without a thought.

7
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:43,103
Good thing, too.
This first Saturday in October...

8
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:45,071
brings him to a special place.

9
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:49,509
He's going to 15A Impasse Bertholon
in Paris' 9th district.

10
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:53,313
And by chance orfate,
if such a thing exists...

11
00:01:53,348 --> 00:01:57,083
to get there, whether by
St. Lazare, Opיra...

12
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,074
Gare du Nord or Pigalle...

13
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,881
Jean-Jacques must endure
a veritable hell.

14
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,223
He'll have to take Rue La Bruyטre.

15
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,895
A  great French author,
who died of apoplexy, in pain...

16
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,381
alone, penniless, forsaken.

17
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,798
Then he'll take Rue Lamartine.

18
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,470
Another great French author
who died of apoplexy, in pain...

19
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,132
alone, penniless and forsaken.

20
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,442
He'll turn into
Rue Hippolyte Lebas...

21
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,747
architect of the infamous
La Petite Roquette prison...

22
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,875
where condemned criminals
awaited execution.

23
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,087
Then it's up Rue des Martyrs,
very aptly...

24
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,456
for that takes him
to Rue St. Georges...

25
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,189
himself a famous martyr...

26
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,927
who was boiled alive,
peeled like a tomato...

27
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:42,460
drawn and quartered...

28
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,191
crushed on the wheel,
then decapitated.

29
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,169
True...
arriving at Impasse Bertholon...

30
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:50,769
obscure physicist...

31
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:54,035
who was struck by lightning
in an early experiment...

32
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,777
Jean-Jacques might see
the macabre route as a bad omen...

33
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,972
might be tempted to turn back.

34
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,647
That would be a mistake.

35
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,384
For he would never discover
this tucked-away street...

36
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,185
where, partially hidden by plants,
tended lovingly by co-op members...

37
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,118
the storied door
to 15A lies in wait.

38
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,196
He'd miss 5 flights
of winding stairs...

39
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,251
never wipe his feet on a
horse hair mat, souvenir of Turkey...

40
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:26,272
never partake of the family
gathering to take place right...

41
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,637
here.

42
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,010
That is...

43
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,145
if someone answers the bell.

44
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,169
- 42.90 please.
- What?

45
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:42,688
2 specials, 1 calzone?

46
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,461
14.50 for the special?
What's on it, caviar?

47
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,428
No. Ham and mushrooms.

48
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:55,059
For 14.50?
You realize that means 95 francs?

49
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,233
What?
Think I got solid gold faucets?

50
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,107
- No idea.
- You know what?

51
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,577
A country with 3 or 4 million
unemployed...

52
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,181
and you want 250 francs
for a few miserable pizzas!

53
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,775
That's indecent.
Disgusting!

54
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,283
- What is it?
- The price of their special.

55
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,754
- You ordered pizza?
- No, why?

56
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,023
So why open the door?
Polo will get out!

57
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,594
- Didn't order?
- He rings, I answer. I'm civilized!

58
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,264
I looked all over.
Must be in your office.

59
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,464
I looked!

60
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,868
What a jerk.

61
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,367
15 is next door.
This is 15A. Bye.

62
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:41,307
Elisabeth Garaud-Larchet,
is a middle school French teacher.

63
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:46,236
Theater club treasurer,
she directs the school play.

64
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:50,290
She's an active member of FSU,
whose motto is her own:

65
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:52,725
"Secularism, justice and charity!".

66
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,528
She left Paris in 1645.

67
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:56,497
Thomas, texting Moliטre?

68
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:58,396
Battling academic decline...

69
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,167
she has no time
to change sweaters.

70
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:03,431
Not Monday, not Tuesday...

71
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,072
not even Wednesday.

72
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,907
She's off Fridays.

73
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,438
Academic decline is no fatality.
It's her daily battle.

74
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,438
Stop that.
What's the matter with you? Mora!

75
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,251
Principal's office, now!

76
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:24,057
At times she has grave doubts about
the future of public education.

77
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:25,223
Lose the cap.

78
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,627
In a jaded and selfish world...

79
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:29,829
she fearlessly perseveres.

80
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,592
A chronic absentee.

81
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,231
- I think this kid has something.
- Open your eyes. He's a loser.

82
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,485
No, Matthias.
He's made progress.

83
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,067
- A 35 average!
- Up from 25.

84
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,513
Not going to change?

85
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,414
Who touched my mess?

86
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,509
Pierre Garaud
is a Sorbonne Literature professor.

87
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,686
A Renaissance specialist...

88
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,157
he's a beacon
of French higher ed...

89
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,387
thanks to his rapier wit.

90
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,453
It's as simple as
distinguishing asyndeton...

91
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,855
from parataxis.
Right, Mr. Bertrand?

92
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,936
Fortyish and flamboyant,
idolized by his students...

93
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:13,104
corduroy is like his second skin.

94
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,109
There's his Monday suit,
the brown one, his favorite.

95
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:19,477
Tuesday is the midnight blue.

96
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,073
Wednesday is the tan one,
not easy to wear.

97
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,884
Star author
of the "Jalons Critiques" series...

98
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,218
Pierre likes going to Vrin Books,
to soak up the love.

99
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,223
And with each new academic year...

100
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,659
he wonders if he'll beat
his legendary record...

101
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:39,061
527 copies sold
of "Pyrrhonism and Montaignism"...

102
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:43,235
the enormous success of which got
him lectures as far away as Moscow.

103
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,603
Right, Mr. Cherkassov?

104
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,239
In short,
like his model Montaigne...

105
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,141
Pierre's research
leaves no stone unturned.

106
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,572
What is Polo doing here?

107
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,749
Find them yet?

108
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,548
What a mess.

109
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:04,157
Despite all their differences,
their fortuitous flaws...

110
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:06,785
- Find them?
- No. I found your bell.

111
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,593
Where are they?

112
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,664
They love each other Mondays,
Tuesdays...

113
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,233
If it's Maria, she's fired.

114
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:14,860
And every other day.

115
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,442
Shit! The semolina!

116
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,911
- Answer that?
- You answer!

117
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,881
- It's for you!
- I got my hands in semolina!

118
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,680
- It's for you, I know!
- I got my hands in semolina!

119
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,957
Hello.

120
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,759
Hi, Franחoise.

121
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,629
Franחoise Larchet,
mother of Elisabeth and Vincent.

122
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,930
A bright and elegant woman
with impeccable decorative taste.

123
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,105
She has a beautiful alto voice,
but she's a bit talkative.

124
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,470
I mean incredible!

125
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,009
Pretty talk ative.

126
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:57,476
You must go!

127
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,075
Very, very talk ative.

128
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,166
When she lost her husband,
people worried.

129
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:07,153
This early Mitterrandian
fought back...

130
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:09,951
despite the naysayers.

131
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,856
She left Paris for pictorial pursuits
of staggering proportions.

132
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,098
And here in La Castide,
in the Alpilles...

133
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:22,302
tending her garden,
she found happiness again.

134
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:25,071
I'll put her on.
Hold on, Franחoise.

135
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:26,271
Babu, your mother!

136
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,276
The harissa.
In the sauce or separate?

137
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,280
- Does Anna eat spicy?
- Who knows? She never eats!

138
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,273
Mom, hi!

139
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,885
For seffa,
you put the raisins in first?

140
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,421
Oil the plate, pour the grain off.

141
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:43,412
Just the raisins, Mom.

142
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,895
Too early they swell, too late
they shrivel. Got it, thanks.

143
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,385
OK, love you.

144
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,927
Kisses.

145
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,464
The Rosenthals came!

146
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,447
How is his hip?

147
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,127
And how's Suzie?

148
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,172
And the dog?

149
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,341
Shit!

150
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,075
The lawn mower?

151
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,843
He buys German?
He's a forgiving sort.

152
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,021
But they still bought
presents forthe kids.

153
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:20,059
The kids are Myrtille, 12,
and Apollin, 4.

154
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,627
Myrtille is thin, smart, fragile.

155
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,530
Some hard-to-place
nostalgic quality...

156
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,295
makes her mysterious
and admired by herfather.

157
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,467
Isn't Mme. Bovary
totally neurasthenic?

158
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,271
Totally, yeah.

159
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,077
Tom-Tom and Mrs. Dubouchon
have an Oedipal thing, right?

160
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,177
Totally.

161
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:43,282
Apollin likes dressing up,
Playmobil, and Amיlie Mauresmo.

162
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,716
Toilet trained late...

163
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,686
he had many sessions with
a well-known child psychologist...

164
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,392
who Elisabeth found really swell.
Pierre immediately abhorred him.

165
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:53,689
What an asshole!

166
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,369
Really?

167
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,107
What now?

168
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:13,646
Distraction. Opens your mind
and boom, it comes back.

169
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,910
Set the table, that's distracting.

170
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,100
I was talking to Pierre.

171
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,855
They're coming with Claude.

172
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,576
No, you won't disturb us.

173
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:23,955
Mom, I'm...

174
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,124
I'm telling you to call.
I wouldn't say it if...

175
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,117
Right. Love you.

176
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,394
Mom, that's them! Love you!

177
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,270
So discreet it's a bother!

178
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:38,703
That's your mother!

179
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,633
- Pierre.
- Howare you?

180
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,775
Rosי goes with everything.

181
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,869
Babu is doing a Moroccan buffet.

182
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,106
- It'll do as a Sidi-Brahim.
- No, a Boulaouane.

183
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,341
Sidi-Brahim is Algerian,
a colonial wine.

184
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,860
Smells delicious.

185
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,293
Claude Gatignol...

186
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,765
first trombone of the
Radio France Philharmonic.

187
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,063
Libra, Libra rising.

188
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:13,232
True to his astrological sign,
he is temperate and constant.

189
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,100
For Claude, life is pure wonder.

190
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,140
With each passing day,
some detail delights him.

191
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,380
Perfect shower temperature...

192
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,117
the muffled whoosh of an iron
over a silk shirt...

193
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:28,280
the dizzying flavor
of home-made clafoutis.

194
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,007
A happy man, of muted temper...

195
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:34,726
defined better by what he's not.

196
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,163
Not angry...

197
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,630
not weird...

198
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,062
not dishonest.

199
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,202
"Not" is sort of what he is.

200
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,096
- Hey, look at me. You got highlights!
- You miss nothing.

201
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,142
- Lovely.
- Pierre hates it.

202
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,342
I do not.

203
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,730
Elisabeth and Claude
are long-time friends.

204
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:57,717
Starting in Mme. Derveau's
ballet class.

205
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,207
Claude was the only boy.

206
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,243
They've been inseparable ever since.

207
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,670
Summer, fall, winter, spring...

208
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:08,719
their friendship is ever renewed.

209
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,499
His sensitivity makes him
a shoulder to cry on.

210
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,100
He can listen without judgment.

211
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,127
As if he could read you,
like an open book.

212
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:22,969
- What did you play?
- Bartףk. Concerto for...

213
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,277
- What?
- Babu lost the cellar keys.

214
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,682
- Some emergency?
- Drives me nuts to mislay things.

215
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:31,673
What do I win if I find them?

216
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,714
- My eternal gratitude.
- Oh! Well then.

217
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,189
- The children?
- In bed!

218
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,390
Was Marseilles good?

219
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,095
- They offered me a job.
- Down there?

220
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,963
Obviously.
Their trombonist drowned.

221
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,298
- But you're not going.
- I might.

222
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,732
- What do you mean?
- I'm thinking it over.

223
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,592
- I thought it over. No!
- Babu!

224
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,911
- It's so far away.
- It's close.

225
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,945
You said that for Toronto.

226
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,950
- Not nearly as far.
- It isn't?

227
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:05,950
3 hours' commute.

228
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,288
The Ostrias moved to the burbs.
We never see them.

229
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,755
And that's a good thing.

230
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,896
Babu, I haven't made a decision yet.

231
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:18,896
Marseilles must be nice.

232
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,233
Near La Castide.
Franחoise would love it.

233
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,632
Yeah, I hope so.

234
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,939
Helo?

235
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,272
Codes haven't changed in 10 years.
Forgot them?

236
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,235
Too bad.
We'll eat without you.

237
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,976
Vincent.

238
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:44,212
I'm magnanimous.
One hint: First one is Marignan.

239
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,390
Yes, right.

240
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,688
The second: Is Austerlitz.

241
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,931
Vincent, come on, Austerlitz.

242
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,728
Cher and Hautes-Alpes.

243
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,235
The Department, not the singer.

244
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:01,195
I'll take pity on you.
1805.

245
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,142
And now the irresistible,
the one and only...

246
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,101
Vincent Larchet.

247
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,047
Franחoise's son,
Elisabeth's brother...

248
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,752
Pierre's bestfriend,
Claude's childhood friend.

249
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,686
Semi-pro tennis player,
crack golfer...

250
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:20,055
Vincent is attractive especially in
his black lycra wife-beater.

251
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,229
After acing middle school
with honors...

252
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:24,978
Vincent became an agent.

253
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:26,693
A luxury real estate agent.

254
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,401
Merciless but extremely courteous...

255
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,339
a paragon of elegance and
modesty zooming along...

256
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:36,242
like a train in the night.
Like a jungle puma...

257
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:38,073
like a rocket in space.

258
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,077
Always ready to dive in...

259
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:44,083
Vincent thought his future
was mapped out until...

260
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:47,052
one Aug. 15,
when destiny took a turn.

261
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,915
- The right of way!
- Such a guy thing to say!

262
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,960
Vincent Larchet.

263
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,797
Anna Caravatti.
Both were bowled over.

264
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,735
And soon Anna would be
expecting Vincent's child.

265
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,238
Vincent Larchet.
A sort of modern hero.

266
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,405
In a word...

267
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,973
Get an elevator.

268
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,810
- Me!
- Mr. Know-Nothing.

269
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,107
- You OK?
- Yeah.

270
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,707
Cheval Blanc '85?

271
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,814
Wow, thanks.

272
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,578
No sweat.
Gift from a client.

273
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,781
- You should decant it.
- Right.

274
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,218
- I forgot my costume!
- I forgot you were funny.

275
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,020
Put a rag on your arm,
you could serve.

276
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,358
- Where's Fatso?
- Kitchen.

277
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,092
Not her Moroccan buffet!

278
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,335
No...

279
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,133
Where are the carafes?

280
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,237
Haven't moved in 10 years.

281
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,878
Cheval Blanc '85, wow!

282
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,514
From a client.

283
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,575
- The kids?
- In bed!

284
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,718
8:14.
It's Saturday.

285
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,047
You don't know Austerlitz?
Friedland, lיna, OK.

286
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,459
Austerlitz!

287
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,122
I should memorize Metro stops?
I never use it.

288
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,264
That driveway OK?

289
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,434
- Might get a ticket.
- Do they tow?

290
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,268
I don't think so.
They'd need a tank!

291
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,242
Insurance problems
with your Renault?

292
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:17,275
- No.
- Great.

293
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,744
I scratched a red car,
left your number.

294
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,613
- Mine?
- Yeah. You don't care?

295
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,549
No, great.
Can't wait to turn you in.

296
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,218
I'll bet.

297
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:31,086
We kid, but 4-wheel drive
must be handy on the left bank.

298
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:34,920
All those hills,
and when the Biטvre's at high water.

299
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:39,632
It's not a 4-wheel drive, actually.
It's an SUV.

300
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,232
A crossover, if you like.

301
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,103
No, too much English.
Can't be good.

302
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:46,904
Pretty nice here.
You got a deal.

303
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,776
I could get you 9,000 a meter, easy.
Without an elevator!

304
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:53,978
You said it was all addicts
and immigrants.

305
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,216
It used to be.
That's what you leftists do best.

306
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:59,912
You dare to invest
in high potential areas.

307
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,713
What are you doing?
Can I play?

308
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,386
Looking for the cellar keys.

309
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,026
What do you win?

310
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,224
- His eternal gratitude.
- For that, I'll look.

311
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,472
- You read Russian?
- I started again.

312
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,072
I started Italian.

313
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,473
- Really?
- I watch tennis on RAI.

314
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,245
My kiss hello?

315
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,082
Your husband's treasure hunt!

316
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,583
- And Anna?
- Coming.

317
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,049
Some Japanese clients.

318
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,589
- I like your haircut.
- Thanks, Pierre hates it.

319
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:37,855
I do not!

320
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,552
So didn't Anna
have her ultra-sound today?

321
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,593
What?
What is it?

322
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,300
There's good news... and bad news.

323
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,470
- What?
- The good news is it's a boy.

324
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,644
The bad news is he's dead.

325
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,353
I'm putting you on.
He's fine.

326
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,788
- Fine! Check out my beautiful son!
- That's not funny!

327
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:18,586
- Sure it is. Look!
- Don't joke like that. Let me see.

328
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,232
- My nephew.
- A new record.

329
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,066
So young and already so rich!

330
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,901
What's wrong with you?

331
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,136
- Uh-oh!
- What? What is it?

332
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,074
He's tilts like his dad.

333
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:38,217
- Called Franחoise?
- I tried, it's always busy.

334
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:42,288
I spoke to her.
She wants to knowwhen you're coming.

335
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:44,855
How should I know?
8 months away.

336
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,415
Look, in any case,
you come whenever you want.

337
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,025
We'll be there with the kids,
from July 5th to the 20th.

338
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,864
They stay with
Mom until Aug. 6th.

339
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,801
Then Michel and Cristelle come.
But you come when you want.

340
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,204
Between the 11th and the 12th.

341
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,141
Vincent, you could
when we're there.

342
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No.

343
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,180
You could change your mind.
But give her an idea.

344
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,615
- The weekend of the 36th.
- Vincent!

345
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,887
She's always there anyway.
Same crap every year.

346
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,954
Maybe she has friends to see.

347
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,590
- She can do that all winter.
- She does.

348
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,895
Rosenthals one week,
then Uncle Hector another.

349
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,363
I know when I'm not coming.

350
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,999
Well...

351
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:32,267
- Should we wait for Anna?
- Save her some smokes.

352
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,871
She smokes now?

353
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:38,065
What can I say? Only woman who
started smoking when pregnant.

354
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,037
Pre-natal stress.

355
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:44,616
I don't want to butt in, but...
it's bad for your son.

356
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,116
Tell her later.

357
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,745
- He'll be tiny.
- He'll be a jockey.

358
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,495
So, it's a boy.
We didn't know the sex.

359
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,190
You mean how to do it?

360
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,899
We decided to preserve
a level of mystery.

361
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,283
I was afraid I'd project,
skip a stage.

362
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:08,299
The more precise an idea you have...

363
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:13,445
the more you fantasize, the harder
it is to meet the real child.

364
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,213
What did your shrink say?

365
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,775
That birth has surprised men
for thousands of years.

366
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,849
Babu should have your 3rd
in the woods, a twig in herteeth.

367
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,090
Stop.

368
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,259
You throw that at your students?

369
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,527
- Table's ready!
- A little room!

370
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,626
- What do we have?
- What have we?

371
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,237
- A put-down.
- Let me put this down.

372
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:39,137
Move those books.

373
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,072
- Careful.
- Great.

374
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:47,039
- Now. Those are parsley briks...
- Yes.

375
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,931
- I made a plate for Anna.
- What a relief.

376
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:12,004
- Not enough?
- Expecting Claude's orchestra?

377
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,733
Double is barely enough!

378
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,975
When we were kids,
every crumb was counted.

379
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,909
Come on, it wasn't Biafra!

380
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,079
- Defending his mommy.
- It's true.

381
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,414
Now, do you have ideas for the name?

382
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,451
Yes.

383
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,389
We actually have a precise idea.

384
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:32,091
- Can we know?
- Guess!

385
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:33,124
- No.
- Yes.

386
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,045
- We should wait for Anna.
- It'll pass the time. Guess.

387
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,966
- Not Henri, like Dad and Grandpa!
- No, of course not.

388
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:44,436
But I'm sure it's classical.
Matthieu or Paul.

389
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,070
No, not an apostle.

390
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:49,597
- Neither is Paul.
- Paul's not an apostle?

391
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,604
- Not one ofthe 12.
- A pinch-hitter?

392
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,796
Think of his tastes,
what he likes.

393
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,280
Shame "Rolex" isn't a boy's name.

394
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,623
What's first? Cheval Blanc
or Fontaines de Provence?

395
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,628
To drink or wash our hands?

396
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,295
Nice for Claude.

397
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,298
He knows music, not wine.

398
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,168
- Christophe!
- Less common.

399
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,035
- Camille.
- No, a boy.

400
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,039
- Camille is both.
- Mine's only boys.

401
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,473
Lancelot!

402
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,269
Thaddeus. Caesar.

403
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,076
- Basil?
- No.

404
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,395
- Igor?
- Less Russian.

405
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,672
- Bartholomew!
- No.

406
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:29,880
- Balthazar!
- No.

407
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,516
- Give us a hint!
- No!

408
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,118
- Be nice, Vincent.
- No.

409
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,252
One hint!

410
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:38,690
OK. I'm magnanimous.
One hint. It starts with A.

411
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,292
Anatole!

412
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,128
- Alexander.
- No!

413
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:47,132
- Albert. Arthur.
- Alban, Agnan, Artemis...

414
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,934
- Areal name!
- Aurelio!

415
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:50,267
- Antonin?
- No

416
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:54,239
We thought of Aurelio.
But Aurelio Garaud, too many O's.

417
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:55,439
Good point.

418
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,806
- Delicious.
- 500 a bottle!

419
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:02,270
- 500 what?
- Pesetas, dingbat.

420
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,751
- 500 euros.
- It's not for mass.

421
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,582
Or I'd go more often!

422
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,220
- Where were we?!
- Aurelio Garaud.

423
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,713
- Right, we liked Aurelio.
- But it's no. So?

424
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,292
Aymeric?

425
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,228
More familiar.

426
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,753
- Antoine?
- More original.

427
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,029
- Albator?
- What are you, crazy?

428
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,766
Alphonse?

429
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,302
Not bad!

430
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,037
- It's Alphonse?
- No.

431
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:30,975
But warmer.

432
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:35,242
OK, wait. Alphonse...
Phonce, Once...

433
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,173
Nonce!

434
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,550
- Nonce?
- It starts with an A.

435
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,952
Anonce.

436
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,324
Starts with an A!

437
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,555
I'll finish the seffa.
Wait for me.

438
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,224
- Not easy.
- No, it isn't.

439
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,500
- Anicet.
- God no!

440
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:59,567
I said wait for me!

441
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,439
Asterix?

442
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:11,749
Not completely stupid.
It is a literary reference.

443
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,482
- Aramis?
- No.

444
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:14,847
- Arsטne.
- No.

445
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,852
Literary? D'Artagnan.

446
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,891
- Out.
- Aragon?

447
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,595
- Not a last name!
- Not Anatole?

448
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,595
- Alain?
- No.

449
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,291
- Abbas?
- Are you stupid?

450
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,795
Amphytrion! I don't know.

451
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,269
You really suck.

452
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:36,308
- Give up?
- We give up, totally. Well?

453
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,508
So what is it?

454
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,176
Adolphe.

455
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,516
Very funny!
But seriously, what is it?

456
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,917
Adolphe.

457
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,419
- You're not calling him Adolf.
- Yes.

458
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,227
You're not calling him Adolf.

459
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,958
Yes, I am.

460
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,442
Adolf?

461
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:15,878
Yes, for the character
in Benjamin Constant's novel.

462
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:19,106
You can't call your son Adolf.
Seriously.

463
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:24,013
I'm serious. Like Julien Sorel.
A name famous in French literature.

464
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,250
The romantic hero, right?

465
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:31,053
Vincent, you can't.
You're putting us on.

466
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,364
Tell me the truth, it's a joke.

467
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,893
In bad taste, but it is a joke.

468
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:42,740
- Name your son after Hitler!
- No, not after Hitler!

469
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,961
You know very well,
Adolf Hitler is with an F.

470
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:48,914
My Adolphe, the French one,
is spelled PHE.

471
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,313
It's the same!

472
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,253
F and PH is the same? I thought
you'd care more about spelling.

473
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:59,707
It sounds the same!
Adolf, Adolphe. Same thing!

474
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:04,126
Vincent, Pierre means
people won't hear Adol-PHE.

475
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,797
They'll hear Adolf.
As in "elephant".

476
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,369
Nice being talked to like a retard.

477
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:17,242
Only a retard wouldn't understand
why you can't name your son Adolf.

478
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:19,778
Stop yelling.
I'll explain if you want.

479
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:20,945
If not, drop it.

480
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,540
- Vincent!
- Pierre, hear him out.

481
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:29,084
I was reading "Adolphe",
Constant's novel...

482
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,581
and so was Anna, when we met.

483
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,390
We loved it.

484
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,027
We loved that character.
The book defined our meeting.

485
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,629
We decided ifit was a girl,
we'd call her Ellיnore.

486
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,967
- A boy...
- Fuck, he's going to do it.

487
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:48,063
He read one book in his whole life.
It had to be that one.

488
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,741
You gave it to me.

489
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,245
When did you start reading
what I give you?

490
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,645
Achilles! I'm sure it's Achilles!

491
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,939
What's going on?

492
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,912
You said it when I wasn't there.

493
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,255
- Achilles, right?
- No, Babu. Not Achilles.

494
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,590
But you said it.

495
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,264
Not nice. I said to wait.

496
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,235
- That's not the problem.
- Not for you!

497
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,404
- Your brother...
- I don't care.

498
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,271
- Babu.
- I don't care!

499
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,309
- Look...
- Forget it. You wouldn't wait.

500
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:26,376
- You don't want to know?
- No!

501
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,408
- I'll tell you!
- I won't listen!

502
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,416
Babu, stop.

503
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,858
That's enough.

504
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,555
This is why Bedouins
don't eat with their wives.

505
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,221
Adolphe. Hear me?
Adolphe!

506
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:50,501
What?

507
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,272
Adolphe! He's naming him
Adolphe Caravatti-Larchet.

508
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:57,139
- Oh, no.
- Then what is it?

509
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,109
Changed your mind?

510
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,747
No, but he won't have Anna's name.
Just Larchet.

511
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,181
That silly fad.

512
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,446
Garaud-Larchet is silly?

513
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,419
A little.

514
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,756
Adolf is OK, but not silly fads.

515
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,924
My name is Vincent Larchet.

516
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:17,093
Why should my son be named
Caravatti-Larchet?

517
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,791
Or keep it all. 2 generations
and your ID will weigh a pound!

518
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,766
Spain or Portugal...

519
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,738
Screw Portugal!
He's calling his son Adolf! Got it?

520
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,763
Who cares what he puts after it?

521
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,067
Why be hostile?

522
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,039
Your brother is naming his son
after the Fhrer.

523
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,111
And I'm hostile?

524
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,250
You're really calling
your son Adolf?

525
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:47,223
For the 40th time,
I'm calling my son Adol-PHE.

526
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,126
You can't do that.

527
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,231
Imagine at school.
For a short kid...

528
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,431
Stop that already.

529
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:58,026
- How will the teacher call him?
- By his name!

530
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,531
I couldn't.

531
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:04,071
As a teacher, maybe.
But as an aunt, no way!

532
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,740
I couldn't say...

533
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,045
"Your snack is ready, Adol..."

534
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,913
See? I can't!

535
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:18,089
Sorry.
I'll call him something else.

536
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,454
Yeah? What?

537
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,251
I don't know.
I'll find a nickname.

538
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,792
Cutems! There.
"Your snack's ready, Cutems."

539
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:30,767
Cutems?

540
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:34,636
Cutems will have to learn that
another Cutems invaded Poland.

541
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,268
It's not funny!

542
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,875
It is, a little.

543
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,778
You'll call my son Adolphe,
his name...

544
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,216
after the great romantic hero
of the 19th century.

545
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,882
And history's worst tyrant.

546
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,514
Adolphe came before Adolf.

547
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,454
But your Adolphe comes afterward.

548
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,219
Look. His arm is raised.
A Nazi salute!

549
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,529
You think Adolf was Adolf
because his name was Adolf?

550
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,529
Say that again?

551
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,866
You think Adolf...

552
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,597
Maybe we could eat
and change the subject.

553
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,870
Babu, it's important.

554
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,807
Adolf Hitler didn't become Hitler
because his name was Adolf.

555
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:15,808
If his name had been Michel or Pepito,
he'd have been just as bad.

556
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,615
"Hail, Pepito!"
And I would have no problem.

557
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,154
Probably, but his mom and dad,
whose taste must've been like yours...

558
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,520
called him Adolf, not Pepito!

559
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,592
Adolphe doesn't answer
for what Adolf did!

560
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:32,497
You're speaking of the death
of millions of people!

561
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:34,683
He didn't swipe a fucking bicycle!

562
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:36,925
What language do you understand?

563
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,133
- Try German!
- Stop yelling.

564
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,134
You'll wake the children.

565
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,472
That's enough now.

566
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,142
I'm putting olives in the tagine.

567
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,077
Then we'll talk of something else.

568
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,585
No one touched my mechouia.

569
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,432
Vincent...

570
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,988
people have forgotten Adolphe.

571
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:16,241
Only Adolf Hitler remains.

572
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:18,072
Adolf killed Adolphe.

573
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,480
What counts is what people think?

574
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:24,614
- Exactly.
- Even when wrong?

575
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,949
It's a categorical imperative.
A morally indisputable principle.

576
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:33,425
"Act according to that maxim
held as universal law."

577
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,924
What if I don't agree?

578
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,127
Read Constant? Now read Kant.

579
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,796
"Groundwork For Metaphysics".
Thrilling.

580
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:43,234
So Kant thinks I can name him
Starsky or Hutch? Not Adolf.

581
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,137
Starsky and Hutch
didn't exterminate 6 million!

582
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:47,900
Pierre!
The children.

583
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,009
It's making excuses
for crimes against humanity.

584
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:54,129
We won't let you do it.
You have no right.

585
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:57,215
So you feel
that some names are forbidden?

586
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,843
- Of course!
- Let's make a list.

587
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,453
Let's make a list!

588
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,516
Could I write here?
In Myrtille's notebook?

589
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,394
If I have to change,
let me get it right.

590
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,884
OK, I'm listening.

591
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,192
What? Only Adolf?

592
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:16,898
- Still at it?
- Looking for a name. Any ideas?

593
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,800
What about Joseph?
It's classical, sounds nice.

594
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,112
Joseph's no good.

595
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,774
- Why?
- Joseph Stalin.

596
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,755
I know it's Jesus' father's name.
Well, his step-father.

597
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,221
An honest carpenter...

598
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,392
but then Stalin came.
Too bad, according to Pierre.

599
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:44,225
So long Joseph.
So long Benito.

600
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:46,964
Franco.

601
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,565
Augusto.

602
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,695
So long, Paul.

603
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,063
- Paul?
- Pol Pot!

604
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:59,202
3 million dead. Only Khmers
and not the same spelling, but hey.

605
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,279
- Babu, change your cat's name.
- It's Polo.

606
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,784
Let's not nitpick.
Do I get Adolpho? No.

607
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,081
No more Paul.

608
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:11,018
More. Pיtain kills Philippe.
Saddam!

609
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,090
Come on! You must suck at Jeopardy.

610
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,356
- Vincent, listen...
- Is there a kill limit?

611
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,190
Because there are serial killers.

612
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,223
Jack the Ripper.

613
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,302
Francis Heaulme.
Contemporary, but efficient!

614
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,538
I think we got your point,
Vincent.

615
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,705
Really? We have Carlos,
the terrorist.

616
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,868
And Ben Laden.
So long Ben, so long Benjamin.

617
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,113
Babu's cat, my son.
Not much is allowed.

618
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:37,113
I have Bernard or Raul.

619
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,742
Babu, it's up to you.
The cat was born first.

620
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,872
He's your son.
Do what you want.

621
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:46,816
- No, he can't.
- Yes, he can.

622
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:48,725
No, he can't do what he wants!

623
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:51,455
He's the father, he can.

624
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:52,791
But?

625
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:58,359
But name your son after Hitler
you better warn the Rosenthals.

626
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,964
Why would I?
Did they consult me for their kids?

627
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,544
- That's not the same.
- It is!

628
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,982
The Rosenthals are educated.
They can distinguish...

629
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:12,901
between Adolf and Adolphe.

630
00:34:12,936 --> 00:34:14,611
Stop acting like an idiot!

631
00:34:14,646 --> 00:34:16,252
Call your son Adolphe...

632
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,123
it's either mindless
or a provocation.

633
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,123
One or the other!

634
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,542
Maybe you're honest,
but after this conversation...

635
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:26,960
you can't pretend you didn't know.
That's over.

636
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,468
You can't claim to be hurtful
out of carelessness.

637
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:34,131
From now on, you know.
It's a deliberate act.

638
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,410
You can't wear a Nazi uniform
and say you love to dress up.

639
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,544
If you call him Adolphe...

640
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,241
I will consider it a fascist act.

641
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:46,183
A position statement!

642
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,919
There!

643
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,713
Discussion over.

644
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,098
OK, you're right.

645
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,066
Can't call my son Adolphe.

646
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,043
And you always say
he's a stubborn ass!

647
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,946
I'm proud of you.

648
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,354
Now...

649
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,973
the tagine course later?

650
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,457
- All together.
- Fine.

651
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,531
When I get back,
we'll talk Claude out of Marseilles.

652
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,074
Picked a neighborhood?

653
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,475
I said wait so fucking wait!

654
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,856
You were right, Pierre.

655
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,265
Can't ignore other people.

656
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,697
Know what convinced me?

657
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,569
The dressing up.

658
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,099
A private act which,
willingly or not, becomes public.

659
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,279
All is political.

660
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,545
All is display.
Neutrality doesn't exist.

661
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,619
I believe so.

662
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,253
So you're right.

663
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,416
The more I think about it,
the more I think...

664
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,292
I'll name my son...

665
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,297
Adolf, with an F.

666
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:40,497
What?

667
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,099
You opened my eyes.

668
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,295
Dressing up.
That's what did it.

669
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,137
Chaplin!

670
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,306
Chaplin and his little mustache!

671
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,708
Who was the greatest
anti-fascist artist? Chaplin!

672
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,278
He had it licked.

673
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,883
He wouldn't even let Hitler
have the aspect! There.

674
00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:02,487
Thanks to you, I'm naming my son
Adolf with an F.

675
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:03,653
You're insane.

676
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,824
I won't give in for lack of courage
or to conform.

677
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:08,257
I'm making a break.

678
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,795
I'm standing in the road
in front of a tank...

679
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,729
like in Tiananmen Square.

680
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,564
I say to Hitler:

681
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,796
"You took Alsace and Lorraine,
but not our names!".

682
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,436
Your simplistic view...

683
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:24,175
tends to make him a myth,
an immovable icon.

684
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,175
You deify him.

685
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,110
- I deify Hitler?
- Absolutely!

686
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,179
Had Picasso named
his son Adolf...

687
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,918
it would've been a greater
message for peace than Guernica.

688
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:37,046
- What crap!
- You convinced me, your turn.

689
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:41,225
Here: Imagine a very ugly girl,
poorly dressed...

690
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,887
a leftist spokes person.

691
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,998
- Like the one you vote for.
- Yeah, we get it.

692
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:49,466
Now imagine her name
is Marilyn.

693
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,471
She'd soil the memory
of the star we admire.

694
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:59,137
Then why is it this can't operate
in the other direction?

695
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,614
My son will be a great guy.
He'll beat fascism.

696
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:09,087
He'll break Hitler's monopoly,
knock him off your pedestal.

697
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:12,352
I'm speechless
before such nonsense.

698
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,225
Claude, what man do you hate most?

699
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,981
- Hitler, I guess.
- No, living.

700
00:38:20,016 --> 00:38:22,465
- I hate no one.
- Make an effort.

701
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,266
There must be one person
who merits your disdain.

702
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,868
- You don't know him.
- Who?

703
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,106
The new Radio France administrator.

704
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,679
Ambitious little prick.

705
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:37,447
See? You can hate.

706
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,118
Keep it up in 10 years you'll
be normal. His name?

707
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:41,551
Franחois Chocard.

708
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:47,085
You think, perfect name
for an asshole.

709
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,121
But not when
it's St. Franחois d'Assises.

710
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,196
Or Franחois Mitterrand.

711
00:38:52,231 --> 00:38:53,896
Or Franחois Mauriac.

712
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,065
Franחois Villon,
Franחois I.

713
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,762
- You, Claude!
- Nor Claude Franחois!

714
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,437
Therefore, though
Franחois Chocard...

715
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:05,025
out of idiocy could,
within Radio France...

716
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,579
erase kings, presidents
and great authors...

717
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:10,815
then Adolf Larchet will undo Hitler!

718
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,874
Adolf is dead, long live Adolf!

719
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:18,780
- What is this?
- Adolf just won another battle.

720
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,521
- Again?
- Thanks to Franחois Chocard.

721
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,164
- What?
- You had to be there!

722
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,100
Sorry I'm making dinner!

723
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:29,966
You walk out every 2 mins.

724
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,771
I shop, mind the kids, do laundry
the dinner, everything...

725
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,972
one question gets me yelled at!

726
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:38,274
- I didn't mean that.
- You said it!

727
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,779
Wait. Stay with us.
We like having you here.

728
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:44,247
What if I like serving dinner hot?

729
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,044
Babu...

730
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,048
- Leave me alone.
- My Babu...

731
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:53,724
It's a sex game with them.
I think she spanks him.

732
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:55,124
You never stop.

733
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,253
Hey, Babu started
pitching those fits at 8.

734
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:03,362
- I'm sorry. It's your brother.
- Get the fuck out of here!

735
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,564
No! Scat! Get away!

736
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:16,247
"Dona may smile, and say the while:
'Oh little fool'".

737
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:18,579
No! Not Mallarmי, it's not fair.

738
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,292
I really believed.

739
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:08,090
- What?
- Adolf.

740
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,097
You should.
I'm serious.

741
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:13,131
I just saw the book,
under the Buddha.

742
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,902
You put it back wrong.

743
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,912
The professor sure did bite!

744
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,051
"Discussion over!"

745
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,622
Did you read it?

746
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:33,055
No way.

747
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,116
The blurb on the back.

748
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,890
- Don't give me away.
- I don't enter pissing contests.

749
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,590
You'd be afraid to lose?

750
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:48,134
No, but I won't lie so figure it out.
Just keep me out of your...

751
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,699
How Swiss can a person get?

752
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,874
Even Adolf respected
Swiss neutrality.

753
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,171
- One point for you.
- Thank you.

754
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,083
"Discussion over."

755
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,416
- So what is it?
- What?

756
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,555
The name you picked.

757
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,363
Henri.

758
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,063
- After your father?
- Yes.

759
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:18,467
- Franחoise will like that.
- I hope it will.

760
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,239
Be nice to Babu.
She went all-out for this dinner.

761
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,527
The lovebirds!

762
00:42:26,562 --> 00:42:28,244
Is Anna here yet?

763
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,737
Yes. Not to wake the kids,
she climbed the wall.

764
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,177
5 months pregnant.

765
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,344
She'll have to catch up.

766
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,959
- Where do I sit?
- Anywhere, darling.

767
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,255
So Apollin says:
"Why does Dad have hairy breasts?".

768
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,933
Funny.

769
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,562
- Seconds?
- If they're not sloppy!

770
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,432
That brings back memories.

771
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,805
It feels good to laugh.

772
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,414
- There was no call to argue.
- I agree.

773
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,944
Sorry, but what is call to argue?

774
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:41,440
- Pierre!
- Come on, let him answer.

775
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,353
What's important enough
to merit argument?

776
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,185
We don't have to argue
at every dinner.

777
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:53,227
We don't have to.
You didn't answer my question.

778
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,195
Well? Come on.

779
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,133
What should we discuss?

780
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,295
Must be boring on the sidelines.

781
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:05,073
Well...
pick a topic for us.

782
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,044
What's funny?

783
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,114
Obviously, fascism bores you.

784
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,084
No, but you didn't speak of fascism.

785
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,254
- Oh?
- What did we speak of?

786
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:19,518
Not seriously anyway.

787
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,618
You're having fun, pretending.

788
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,729
Role-playing, like kids.

789
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,129
Role-playing?

790
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,099
- Like "Cops and Robbers", or "House".
- Dad!

791
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:33,068
Social issues serve
as matchbox cars.

792
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:36,539
What'll it be?
Mosque at ground zero, right to strike?

793
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,308
You've always done that.

794
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,029
Same argument 50 times,
but you don't believe.

795
00:44:42,064 --> 00:44:45,091
I find it rather amusing
but I'm not a referee.

796
00:44:45,126 --> 00:44:48,118
We amuse him.
Which is contemptuous, but nice.

797
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:50,686
No, Vincent. He's above all that.

798
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,555
I'm above your arguments.
Not "all that".

799
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,893
Switzerland awakens!

800
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:01,022
Could you step off the pedestal
and be with us?

801
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,597
- Us, your friends.
- Aristotle, out of your cave!

802
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,427
- The cave allegory is Plato.
- Right.

803
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,407
Aristotle, too.
He stayed inside.

804
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:12,274
You're in luck, same era.

805
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,190
"Aren't all philosophers
of the same era?"

806
00:45:15,225 --> 00:45:18,071
- A freshman exam question!
- Which I failed!

807
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,051
Hey! Guess who
I had a drink with yesterday!

808
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:25,990
6 PM at the Cafי Beaubourg.
Guess who I had a kir with.

809
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:28,810
- A kir?
- At the Cafי Beaubourg!

810
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:31,595
- Come on, guess.
- Old acquaintance?

811
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,926
Ancient!

812
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,122
What do we win,
besides your eternal gratitude?

813
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,236
I don't know,
a bottle of champagne?

814
00:45:39,271 --> 00:45:40,403
- Dom Perignon?
- Right.

815
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,804
- Antoine Flemmadon.
- Shit!

816
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,173
How'd you guess?

817
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,200
You look like
you drink kirs with him.

818
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,446
That's crazy.

819
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,448
- I gave him your number.
- What?

820
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,585
- He's more your ilk, right?
- Get out of here!

821
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,756
No! Pierre!

822
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,952
- Sure he is.
- Oh I see.

823
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,264
Darling, we're starving!

824
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:11,168
- Did you waited for me?
- Of course we waited!

825
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:12,430
You're such a jerk!

826
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:15,198
What are the codes?

827
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:19,176
I'm magnanimous.
One hint: First is Marignan.

828
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:21,406
- 1515, and?
- Austerlitz!

829
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,976
OK, be right up.

830
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,106
She knows Austerlitz.

831
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,154
What's she doing with me?

832
00:46:30,189 --> 00:46:31,883
We all wonder.

833
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,092
I'm curious,
how did you find Flemmadon?

834
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:37,927
He found me on Facebook.
I took pity.

835
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:41,065
- Still got hair in his eyes?
- Still as hairy!

836
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,532
You saw him shirtless?

837
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,397
Now this!

838
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:49,767
Having fun?

839
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,441
Yes, Apollin is asleep.

840
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,244
Your shrink said to let him yell.

841
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,544
Our shrink also said
you should be more present.

842
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:01,218
We don't have to talk
about this now.

843
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:03,209
I don't have to get up each time!

844
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,615
I'll go next time.

845
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,058
What's the shrink like?

846
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:11,996
- Pricey jerk.
- More pricey or a jerk?

847
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:13,224
Good question.

848
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:23,903
She's right there.

849
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:32,883
- How are you?
- Sorry I'm so late.

850
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:34,441
No problem.

851
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,086
They're so beautiful!

852
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:41,188
- Managed the 5 flights?
- Listen, I'm sitting all day.

853
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,892
Wow, highlights look great!

854
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,760
- Thanks. Pierre hates it.
- I do not!

855
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:52,291
- You waited for me!
- The Larchet's are well-behaved.

856
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:55,904
- See how pretty?
- Yes!

857
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,601
- You shouldn't have.
- We'll keep them!

858
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,143
My husband is
in fine form tonight!

859
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,270
- He really is!
- Good evening.

860
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,349
Haven't gained an ounce!

861
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,717
Never said that when
I was pregnant.

862
00:48:09,752 --> 00:48:12,050
- Sure I did.
- You gained 50 lbs.

863
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,394
- I did not!
- You lost almost all of it back.

864
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:18,691
5 years ago!

865
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:23,926
- It looked great on you.
- I never gained 50 lbs!

866
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:30,908
- Looks delicious, Babu!
- Relax, plenty of briouats left.

867
00:48:30,943 --> 00:48:32,443
I saved you a plate.

868
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:33,705
Have a seat.

869
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:35,077
Apollin is 5?

870
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,307
- So how are you?
- Fine.

871
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,918
Fashion showseason.
It's crazy.

872
00:48:40,953 --> 00:48:41,984
When does it end?

873
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:45,055
End of March.
Then June is winter collections.

874
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,555
Without me this summer.

875
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,128
Why does the fashion world
flip-flop winter and summer?

876
00:48:51,163 --> 00:48:53,028
To prepare the next season.

877
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,462
Not everyone wears
corduroy in August!

878
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,904
True, but who wants to buy
swim trunks in March?

879
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:04,908
No. The question is,
who still says "swim trunks"?

880
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:08,112
- What else is there?
- Suit. Bathing suit.

881
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:11,281
A bathing suit
isn't necessarily a brief cut.

882
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:13,250
He's always been a briefs guy.

883
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:16,120
- Very briefs.
- Very!

884
00:49:16,155 --> 00:49:17,678
He's Mr. Briefs!

885
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,758
Yes, I favor briefs, but...

886
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,296
No buts about it.
I've never seen you in boxers.

887
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:27,096
Me neither!

888
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:30,692
Darling, ever seen Claude
in anything but briefs?

889
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:33,769
Conversation's
reached new heights!

890
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,940
With the orchestra suit,
I have to wear briefs.

891
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:39,101
Right! Your little trombone's fault.

892
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,345
Here.

893
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,114
Babu, I can't eat all that!

894
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,785
You need strength.
You're eating for two.

895
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,719
Right, there are two of you!

896
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:53,245
Two is right.
And not just any two.

897
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,188
Pierre, please.
Don't start in again.

898
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,064
What's going on?

899
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:06,236
Our friends didn't love
our son's name.

900
00:50:06,271 --> 00:50:08,204
- You told them?
- Yes.

901
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,641
And... you didn't like it?

902
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:19,299
No, Anna. They didn't.

903
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:21,283
We were mostly surprised.

904
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,154
Right. It was mainly the surprise.

905
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,354
Not for me.

906
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:28,457
Sorry, Anna,
but I mostly didn't like it.

907
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:32,054
I'm the one who's sorry.

908
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:36,355
We thought...
the allusion would please you.

909
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,407
The allusion?

910
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:47,511
It's the allusion
we didn't like, Anna.

911
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:50,579
- The allusion!
- It's a misunderstanding.

912
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:53,777
- Anna understands very well.
- I think so, yes.

913
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,120
What I don't understand is
your reaction.

914
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,126
That Vincent thought of it, maybe.

915
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,253
But you! That's beyond me.

916
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:08,124
I'm the one who suggested it.

917
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,066
That's true.

918
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,101
You realize who it is,
what he did!

919
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:17,197
What he did?
I don't know, I never met him.

920
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,275
Can she hear herself talk?

921
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:23,580
- Pierre!
- "She" is right here, so talk to her!

922
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:25,614
You're a crazy, stupid girl!

923
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,846
- What?
- Enough! Vincent, this is getting ugly.

924
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,854
This is what comes
of a name like that!

925
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:35,224
Mind your business!
How dare you take that tone?

926
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,662
- He didn't mean to...
- No? He's a French professor.

927
00:51:38,697 --> 00:51:41,298
Exactly!
I know what words mean!

928
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,131
- Fuck you!
- No.

929
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,400
- I'll name my son what I want!
- No, you won't!

930
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:50,107
I won't be lectured by a guy who
names his kids Apollin and Myrtille!

931
00:51:50,142 --> 00:51:52,234
Stop! Stop!

932
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,477
Stop!

933
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,178
It was a joke.

934
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,625
Honey, I...

935
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:16,096
I led them to believe
we'd decided to call our son...

936
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,267
Adolf.

937
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:20,301
Silly.

938
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:23,740
Funny, but silly.

939
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:29,769
But very funny!

940
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,747
Your face...

941
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,508
It was funny, right?

942
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,951
That's the source of Pierre's anger.

943
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,187
We're actually naming our son Henri.

944
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:45,462
Like Dad and Grandpa.
Anna's "allusion" was to Dad.

945
00:52:45,497 --> 00:52:48,063
Now let's calm down,
take a seat...

946
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:51,768
stuff our faces
with falafel, tchoutchouka, pita.

947
00:52:51,803 --> 00:52:53,065
And all hug each other.

948
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,635
- No, honey.
- Shut your trap.

949
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:10,781
OK, it was idiotic.

950
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,453
Very idiotic. Really.

951
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,558
I'm a jerk and I'm sorry.

952
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,889
Anna, sorry.

953
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,595
Pierre, sorry.

954
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,399
Please accept my apologies. OK?

955
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,379
I think I spoiled the mood.

956
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,111
Could you do a number on yours?

957
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:56,227
Babu, help me out.
Enough, it's not like I...

958
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,073
Anyone for mint tea?

959
00:54:03,108 --> 00:54:04,273
Me.

960
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,376
Pierre?

961
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:12,082
You just let it slide, as usual.

962
00:54:12,117 --> 00:54:13,572
Let what slide?

963
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,221
The whole joke was to show us
how ridiculous our kids' names are.

964
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:20,789
No way, Pierre.
It was a joke!

965
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:24,092
It was just a joke.
I saw "Adolphe" on the bookshelf.

966
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:28,359
And "The Brothers Karamazov".
But you chose neither Ivan nor Dimitri.

967
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,897
- Would've been less funny.
- We're all hysterical.

968
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,642
- Pierre, he apologized.
- Anna didn't.

969
00:54:38,677 --> 00:54:41,478
Keep calling me "stupid girl"
if you like.

970
00:54:41,513 --> 00:54:42,877
Darling, please.

971
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,214
Pierre, no one said
your kids' names were ridiculous.

972
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:49,883
No, she said she wouldn't be
lectured by a guy who named...

973
00:54:49,918 --> 00:54:53,517
- his kids Apollin and Myrtille.
- She was upset, come on.

974
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,015
What did she mean?

975
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,856
That she wouldn't be lectured.
She's old enough to decide.

976
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,599
I got that part.
But the end puzzles me.

977
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,899
- What are you asking, Pierre?
- It's pretty clear.

978
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:11,106
What I think of his kids' names.

979
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:12,775
Exactly.

980
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,746
She thinks they'rejust fine.

981
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:18,213
- Really?
- Really!

982
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,910
We think Apollin and Myrtille
are very cute.

983
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,201
I wondered if you'd do it.

984
00:55:24,236 --> 00:55:26,251
- Did what?
- Your frown.

985
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,257
What frown?

986
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:32,129
The one you make when
it's "Who cares?" or "If you like"...

987
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:33,695
but it's really no.

988
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,566
- Bullshit.
- You do make a frown.

989
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:38,193
Stop it, Pierre!

990
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:44,067
You're upset because you got fooled.
Let's move on.

991
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:47,307
Listen...

992
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,747
How was it with the Japanese, love?

993
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:01,451
No idea, love.
I was with Koreans.

994
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,123
How was it with the Koreans, love?

995
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:08,226
- You mean you care?
- Of course.

996
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,092
Look how you act when I do.

997
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,098
Sure I care about your work.

998
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:19,569
All right, then what's
my partner's name?

999
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,739
What's-his-name.

1000
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:32,956
That guy.
The one who annoyed you, you know.

1001
00:56:32,991 --> 00:56:34,256
Sure, I know.

1002
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,918
- So do I.
- So do I.

1003
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,159
Even I know.

1004
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,926
I know, too. Very well.
That weirdo name of his...

1005
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,100
Tip of my tongue!

1006
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,636
See, you did it.

1007
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,536
- What?
- Your frown.

1008
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,408
Fuck off. What is it?
Show me.

1009
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,710
I don't know. Sort of like this.

1010
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,881
Tip of my tongue...

1011
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:03,533
I do that? Really, do I?

1012
00:57:03,568 --> 00:57:06,116
- Really?
- No, no, no.

1013
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:08,018
See, I told you.

1014
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:13,394
It's not that, but you do frown.

1015
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,254
Now you're starting?

1016
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:18,062
Sorry, but you do make a frown.

1017
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,635
- Well, I'd say a pout.
- Right, it's more a pout.

1018
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,874
What kind of pout?

1019
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,272
Sort of like this.

1020
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,077
Yes, that's right!

1021
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,610
Oh say, I like your new hair-do!

1022
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,273
That's exactly it.

1023
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,043
Pierre, that your
Renault downstairs?

1024
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,119
Renault is so classy.

1025
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,217
Right, exactly it!

1026
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,288
So, so classy!

1027
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:54,193
No, we think Apollin and Myrtille
are very cute.

1028
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,605
Exactly it.

1029
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,342
- No way. I don't do that.
- Yes, I swear.

1030
00:57:59,377 --> 00:58:01,276
Looks like a duck!

1031
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,245
More like chicken butt.

1032
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,215
Chicken butt.

1033
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,741
- My mouth's like chicken butt?
- Abit.

1034
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,921
You think it's funny?

1035
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,253
- OK, if you like...
- There!

1036
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,065
"If you like..."

1037
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,061
If my frown means I'm fed up...

1038
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:37,406
yes I frown.
Clear enough?

1039
00:58:37,441 --> 00:58:39,340
Don't get mad.
You asked.

1040
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:41,240
Babu, get off my back.

1041
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:43,518
Ever thought of theater?

1042
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,288
I do some, with my 8th graders.

1043
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:49,626
Your 8th graders are lucky.
You're so observant.

1044
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:52,094
That little grin is so him.

1045
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:12,910
So...

1046
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,016
So what now?

1047
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:18,254
So Apollin and Myrtille
are ridiculous?

1048
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:19,687
Please, get off my back.

1049
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,290
I don't get it.

1050
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:25,250
Quit playing dumb.
You know they're not normal names.

1051
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:28,755
Apollin and Myrtille.
Sounds like a Tom Lehrer song.

1052
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:35,138
My daughter, your niece
has an abnormal name?

1053
00:59:35,173 --> 00:59:37,238
What's normal, Vincent Larchet?

1054
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:40,108
Classical.
Not original, if you like.

1055
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,062
- Better than abnormal.
- Play with words.

1056
00:59:43,097 --> 00:59:45,982
We have been, for a while now.
But tell me:

1057
00:59:46,017 --> 00:59:49,076
Is Adolf normal or original?

1058
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,754
- It's an existing name.
- Existing?

1059
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,892
Apollin and Myrtille exist,
since we named them.

1060
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:58,261
I'm sick of Apollo and Myrtille.

1061
00:59:58,296 --> 01:00:00,058
It's Apollin, not Apollo!

1062
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,889
No mistaking that.

1063
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,500
Excuse me?

1064
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,930
He looks like you.

1065
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,031
My son is ugly?

1066
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,975
Not yet, he's 4.

1067
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,103
He's ridiculous and ugly?

1068
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:20,378
He's not ridiculous,
his father is. You are.

1069
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:25,488
It's ridiculous to make hyphenated
last names for some parity's sake.

1070
01:00:25,523 --> 01:00:28,256
Yes, made-up names are ridiculous.

1071
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:32,128
This originality contest
like post-its stuck on the forehead!

1072
01:00:32,163 --> 01:00:34,498
"Remember I'm different."

1073
01:00:34,533 --> 01:00:36,798
"Remember I'm not classical."

1074
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,731
"Here resides
a family of bright liberals...

1075
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:42,629
with a TV Guide subscription,
but no TV!"

1076
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,906
To me, that's ridiculous!

1077
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:48,144
Henri Larchet does evoke
SUV's and "The Economist".

1078
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:49,344
I don't care!

1079
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:52,215
I don't care what image I project.

1080
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,249
Or what people think of me.

1081
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:58,220
But you are obsessed with
your image, and worse...

1082
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,526
Think you're original?
You'rejust a snob!

1083
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:06,162
I'm image-obsessed
and you don't care?

1084
01:01:06,197 --> 01:01:08,563
Funniest thing you said tonight!

1085
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:11,232
- It is a laugh!
- The dessert buffet.

1086
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:14,103
- Still hungry?
- Those lokums are incredible!

1087
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:17,272
It's incredible
that you would say that.

1088
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:20,910
You, the quintessence,
the purest concentration...

1089
01:01:20,945 --> 01:01:23,179
the very substance of selfishness.

1090
01:01:23,214 --> 01:01:24,840
- Me?
- Pierre!

1091
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,381
I'm selfish?

1092
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:29,681
No, not selfish.
You are selfishness itself.

1093
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:33,085
I knew I had a dozen faults,
but that one...

1094
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:38,593
- Vincent is rather generous.
- Thank you.

1095
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:42,265
Your selfishness isn't basic,
not just anyone can see it.

1096
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,165
Thanks!

1097
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:46,836
I meant at first you don't
say: "Vincent's so selfish".

1098
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:48,804
It's much subtlerthan that.

1099
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:53,109
You can't see it right away,
but it's there.

1100
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:54,940
- You understand?
- No.

1101
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:58,248
Your flights of reason
are inaccessible to me.

1102
01:01:58,283 --> 01:02:00,882
Sure you understand,
and very well.

1103
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,553
You're much more intelligent
than you look.

1104
01:02:03,588 --> 01:02:06,921
Then explain how I'm selfish.

1105
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:09,820
- How I'm selfishness itself!
- Vincent!

1106
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:12,684
- I'm interested. We all are.
- No.

1107
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:16,862
You are absolutely obsessed
by your own person.

1108
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,267
All your sentences begin with "I"...

1109
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:22,105
you can't stand
not being at the center...

1110
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,105
and you'd do anything to be there.

1111
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,973
Of all the people
I've met in my life...

1112
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,576
no one better defines the word:
Selfishness.

1113
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,872
Think I've always been that way?

1114
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,707
Perhaps not always,
but for a while.

1115
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,013
- When?
- When what?

1116
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,247
What did you first notice it?

1117
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:44,224
Stop this! It's unbearable!

1118
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:46,762
- When?
- Claude, say something!

1119
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:49,222
Well? When?

1120
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,131
Thanks!

1121
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,702
- It started with Moka.
- Moka?

1122
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,176
The dog. B.B.'s dog.

1123
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:02,201
- Who?
- B.B.

1124
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:04,069
Beatrice, Dad's sister.

1125
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:08,151
The tall blond, who plays cards.
Who married a banker...

1126
01:03:08,186 --> 01:03:11,184
- that jerk with hair on.
- OK, B.B.'s dog. So?

1127
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:14,183
Don't make that face.
You know what I mean.

1128
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:15,591
No.

1129
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:19,596
B.B. Had a poodle, a horrid thing
she treated like her child.

1130
01:03:19,631 --> 01:03:22,063
Kept kissing it.
Horrible.

1131
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:25,768
She perfumed it, too.
She sprayed it with...

1132
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:28,794
It was a very hot day.
One summer.

1133
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:32,108
The adults took a nap.
Vincent and I were bored stiff.

1134
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:35,043
- How old were you?
- 11 or 12.

1135
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:37,444
- We were 13.
- Your memory is back.

1136
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:41,181
B.B. Told us
that Moka was afraid of water.

1137
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,843
A real aversion, like a cat.

1138
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,547
What a stupid dog he was.

1139
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,248
Remember, Claude?

1140
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:54,563
Sure, the dumbest dog on earth.

1141
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,629
There was a pond.

1142
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:01,170
We were tossing rocks.
Moka rubs up against my leg.

1143
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:03,798
- He's not a dog person.
- So I got this idea.

1144
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,234
I said to Vincent:
"Let's throw him in".

1145
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:11,269
As an experiment, for laughs.
Like you do when you're 13.

1146
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:15,577
Vincent wasn't crazy about it.
He thought it was a dumb idea.

1147
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:18,921
- Wasn't it dumb?
- Yeah, very dumb.

1148
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,088
He's not a dog person.

1149
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,726
I didn't think. I kicked the dog
straight into the pond.

1150
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:24,926
What?

1151
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:28,586
He sank like a stone.
A few bubbles, then nothing.

1152
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,938
You killed Moka?

1153
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:40,226
- I'm the one who killed Moka.
- Horrible.

1154
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:43,444
No, that's not horrible.
It's just stupid.

1155
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:47,245
What's horrible is
Vincent took the rap for me.

1156
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:49,417
Sorry I saved your butt.

1157
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:53,287
See? He was the same at 13.
He trapped me.

1158
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:57,418
I thought it was friendship, but no.
Know what he did?

1159
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,794
No.

1160
01:04:58,795 --> 01:05:00,763
He stole my murderer status
from me.

1161
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:04,667
He wouldn't even leave me that.
He evinced me.

1162
01:05:04,702 --> 01:05:07,101
- Know why?
- No.

1163
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:14,277
I drowned the poor mutt
but he turns to B. B...

1164
01:05:14,312 --> 01:05:16,946
and says, with incredible aplomb:

1165
01:05:16,981 --> 01:05:18,777
"B.B., I killed Moka".

1166
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,249
We should film this.

1167
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:24,219
You were Don Quixote again,
and I was Sancho Panza.

1168
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:29,049
Sancho, you remember
the beating I took, don't you?

1169
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:33,056
Sure. We all remember, Vincent.
That's why you did it.

1170
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:37,190
Just like Adolf,
it's only there for us to remember.

1171
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,091
To make a mark.
Selfishness itself.

1172
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:43,134
Because I wouldn't share
the spanking?

1173
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:47,808
"Egocentric, egotistical,
self-centered, narcissistic...

1174
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,678
caring only for oneself...

1175
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:54,513
recognizing only the reality
of one's own existence."

1176
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,452
You are the definition
of selfish, Vincent.

1177
01:05:57,487 --> 01:06:00,123
While you have the dictionary,
turn to "s" again.

1178
01:06:00,158 --> 01:06:01,323
"S."

1179
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,491
As in "stingy".

1180
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,460
What?

1181
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,861
I'm looking for your adjective.

1182
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,434
Stingy?
The best you can think of?

1183
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,800
Maybe not the best,
but I think of it...

1184
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,573
rather quickly.

1185
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:21,776
There. One set all.
It's a draw.

1186
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,380
- A pause in the cock fight?
- I'd love it.

1187
01:06:24,415 --> 01:06:26,610
- No draws in tennis.
- What?

1188
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:30,081
You said: "One set all, a draw".
That's meaningless.

1189
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,891
- You're a pain in the ass.
- A big pain, in matters of language.

1190
01:06:34,926 --> 01:06:37,558
Right.
You know what words mean.

1191
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:40,762
- It's who I am.
- Listen. I was relativizing.

1192
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:43,733
If you want back in the ring
to get stuck some more...

1193
01:06:43,768 --> 01:06:47,670
put your tights on
and go right ahead!

1194
01:06:47,705 --> 01:06:48,967
Mr. Stingy!

1195
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:51,240
Stop this!

1196
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:55,244
- Pierre's not stingy.
- "Ungenerous, niggardly...

1197
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:57,880
penurious,
tight-fisted with money."

1198
01:06:57,915 --> 01:06:59,881
You're generous and I'm stingy?

1199
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:03,452
Because you gave Myrtille
an iPod for her 4th birthday?

1200
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:05,453
Sorry I don't have your money!

1201
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:09,288
- Those wood things were cheaper.
- Pick-up Sticks, asshole!

1202
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:12,927
My money wouldn't change you.

1203
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:16,966
- I won't spoil kids.
- You sweat every dime you spend!

1204
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:19,867
Look at you
with your little change purse.

1205
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:23,306
You take one coin out of it,
it's like extracting a nail!

1206
01:07:23,341 --> 01:07:24,972
You're a tightwad!

1207
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:27,109
The tightwad invited you.

1208
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:28,910
Your wife did.

1209
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:31,072
Pierre is not a tightwad at all.

1210
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,240
I'd even say he's...

1211
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,087
when there's...

1212
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,059
What's the word?

1213
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,068
He's really...

1214
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:58,230
A spend thrift?
What's Switzerland got to say?

1215
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,644
Well I...

1216
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,671
What? You agree?
You think I'm stingy, too?

1217
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:10,013
Let's say you're someone
who's cautious.

1218
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:13,254
Right! That's it, he's cautious.

1219
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:16,690
Claude-speak
for "Pierre is a tightwad".

1220
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:20,092
But it's what you think.
Enough, Claude.

1221
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,297
Enough.

1222
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:26,235
I'm glad to see, thanks to me,
you two found common ground.

1223
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,269
Now that you're so close...

1224
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,795
so honest and open
with each other...

1225
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:34,310
Claude must know
Vincent's nickname for him.

1226
01:08:34,345 --> 01:08:36,779
No, Pierre!
That's enough now!

1227
01:08:36,814 --> 01:08:38,179
You're both the same.

1228
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,416
- Monopolizing the evening.
- Right!

1229
01:08:40,451 --> 01:08:42,583
Did you even ask
if we were interested?

1230
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,654
- That's right.
- Did either of you praise...

1231
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:46,122
Babu for dinner?

1232
01:08:46,157 --> 01:08:47,122
Of course.

1233
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,522
- No!
- Sure we did!

1234
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,793
- When?
- In the kitchen.

1235
01:08:50,828 --> 01:08:51,993
Right, sure.

1236
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,470
What's my nickname?

1237
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,741
- No, stop with that.
- Claude, don't you start.

1238
01:09:05,776 --> 01:09:07,208
- Vincent.
- Drop it.

1239
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:10,701
- I'd like to know.
- You don't want to know.

1240
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,845
What does it matter?

1241
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,049
Exactly!
What does it matter?

1242
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:18,383
- I just want to...
- Why won't you trust me?

1243
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:24,126
Stop it. You're better
than these two morons.

1244
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:25,293
Vincent, what's my nickname?

1245
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:28,230
- I forbid you!
- What? I'm dreaming!

1246
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:29,744
Claude, please!

1247
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:31,224
I want to know!

1248
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:43,712
The plum.

1249
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:44,946
Pierre!

1250
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,241
- What?
- Nice, Pierre! Very smart.

1251
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,445
He calls you the plum.
Happy?

1252
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:52,450
Plum?

1253
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:55,287
Like a perk?

1254
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,625
No, Claude.

1255
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,189
As in "Sugar Plum Fairy".

1256
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:07,302
"Sugar Plum Fairy"?
I don't get it.

1257
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,905
Don't play dumb.
You get it.

1258
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,800
We love you as you are.

1259
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,105
What do you mean?

1260
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,081
"Sugar Plum Fairy".
You really don't get it?

1261
01:10:19,116 --> 01:10:21,072
No, I really don't get it.

1262
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,320
A fairy.

1263
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:27,455
A fruit.

1264
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,082
A queer.

1265
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,453
A pansy, a fag if you like.
Get it now?

1266
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,700
You think I'm a homosexual?

1267
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,106
You know...

1268
01:10:47,143 --> 01:10:49,805
I feel better
having told the truth about Moka.

1269
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:58,280
Sorry, but I'm not
homosexual at all.

1270
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,079
You're the last one to know.

1271
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,789
Did you hear what I just said?

1272
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,761
- You can tell us.
- If he wants to!

1273
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,536
It's his life, after all.

1274
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:18,768
If I were I'd say so.
There's no shame in it.

1275
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:23,345
- But I'm not. I can't...
- Come on, Claude. You're a bachelor...

1276
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:26,782
a musician, you live in
the Marais. Wear orange.

1277
01:11:26,817 --> 01:11:30,183
Who wears orange?
Outside of Guantanamo.

1278
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:33,578
You make clafoutis, you drink kir.

1279
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:37,191
You get manicures,
you like Freddy Mercury.

1280
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,560
Mercury, for fuck's sake!

1281
01:11:40,563 --> 01:11:43,123
- You burn incense.
- Papier d'Armיnie.

1282
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:46,024
- Whatever, it's perfumey.
- So?

1283
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,968
If you don't eat meat,
you're vegetarian.

1284
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:53,431
Ride a bike, you're a cyclist.
It's just a fact.

1285
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,143
I can't get over you all.

1286
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,381
I'm speechless
before such rampant stupidity.

1287
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:03,285
I like boys because I wear
orange shirts.

1288
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,048
You realize?

1289
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:08,557
I like Visconti and Cary Grant.
You missed that!

1290
01:12:08,592 --> 01:12:10,286
- We weren't judging you.
- No!

1291
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,863
Sure...

1292
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:25,600
Well, obviously...

1293
01:12:26,242 --> 01:12:28,144
we were wrong.
Sorry.

1294
01:12:28,179 --> 01:12:29,543
Vincent, please.

1295
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:32,274
Sorry, I didn't know
he liked girls.

1296
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,582
Because I mean...

1297
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:40,218
you like girls?

1298
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,924
There's one I love.

1299
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,261
What?

1300
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:50,131
- You met someone?
- Yes.

1301
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,426
And you're together?
For real?

1302
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,470
Yes, Babu.

1303
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,271
What's she like?
Tell us.

1304
01:12:57,306 --> 01:13:00,809
Tall, short, blond, brunette,
big breasts, tattoos?

1305
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:02,443
Vincent, don't be vulgar!

1306
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:05,275
We have to know.
Claude, tell us!

1307
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,072
- I'm in no mood tonight.
- Why not?

1308
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:12,888
You were all for role-playing.
It gets serious, you hide.

1309
01:13:12,923 --> 01:13:14,253
You dodge us.

1310
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:19,762
Maybe you're not a fag,
but you are certainly a coward.

1311
01:13:19,797 --> 01:13:21,362
OK, ask away Vincent.

1312
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,999
- Don't play his game.
- What game?

1313
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:26,602
30 years, we know nothing of him.

1314
01:13:26,637 --> 01:13:29,053
He's mum.
Like a court reporter.

1315
01:13:29,088 --> 01:13:31,469
This is it, ask me your questions!

1316
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:34,373
- Is it really a girl?
- Yes.

1317
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:37,609
- How long has it been?
- Several years.

1318
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:43,615
What?
And you never told me about her?

1319
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,111
What does she look like?

1320
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:49,924
Gorgeous.

1321
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:52,894
Stop it, Claude.
Not like this.

1322
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,297
Why shouldn't he tell us?

1323
01:13:55,332 --> 01:13:56,924
Because, Babu.

1324
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,628
He doesn't answer to us.

1325
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,871
Hang on, Anna.
You know her?

1326
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,096
Yes, Anna knows her.

1327
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:09,311
So do we know her, too?

1328
01:14:09,346 --> 01:14:10,511
Yes.

1329
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,045
It's not Antoine Flemmadon, is it?

1330
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:18,076
No, not Antoine Flemmadon.

1331
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:21,188
Someone much closer.

1332
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:23,521
- Much closer?
- Much closer.

1333
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,351
Closer than anyone, in fact.

1334
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:28,359
Closer than anyone?

1335
01:14:29,732 --> 01:14:32,257
That's it, Claude.
Tell them the truth.

1336
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,227
You went too far.

1337
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,211
It can't be.

1338
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,852
Don't drag this out.
Say it!

1339
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,193
It can't be.

1340
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,794
It can't be.

1341
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:04,999
Claude!

1342
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,068
- Tell them, or I will!
- I'll tell them.

1343
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,037
Hang on!

1344
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:13,405
- You shut up. What?
- I'm sorry, Vincent.

1345
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,773
I can't believe this.
You didn't do that.

1346
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:18,075
- Did you do that?
- Do what?

1347
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:20,378
The two of you!

1348
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,618
Are you a complete moron?
Vincent!

1349
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,323
Sure?

1350
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,251
Of course!
What did you imagine?

1351
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:39,392
That's not it at all, Vincent!

1352
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,096
Scared the shit out of me!

1353
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:47,069
I really fucking believed it!

1354
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:51,213
- So did I.
- Not at all.

1355
01:15:51,248 --> 01:15:52,680
You're so stupid!

1356
01:15:58,087 --> 01:16:00,180
I could never do such a thing.

1357
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:04,922
Then who is she?

1358
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:26,112
I am...

1359
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:31,085
seeing Franחoise.

1360
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,218
Franחoise who?

1361
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:40,094
Franחoise...

1362
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,393
your mother.

1363
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,235
Her mother what?

1364
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:54,801
I'm seeing Franחoise, Vincent.

1365
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,075
Who's Franחoise Vincent?

1366
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:01,078
No! Franחoise! Mom!

1367
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,078
What, you're seeing Mom?

1368
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,886
We're together.

1369
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:13,594
Vicent, I...

1370
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:25,637
Oh fuck.

1371
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:37,612
I thought we were close.

1372
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,510
We are close, Babu.

1373
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,085
I thought you trusted me.

1374
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,294
You didn't tell me.

1375
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:48,147
But I do trust you.

1376
01:17:48,182 --> 01:17:49,930
Not as much as Anna.

1377
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:52,132
- That's different.
- How long?

1378
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:55,103
Babu, it's your business.
I'm not involved.

1379
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:56,972
How long have you known?

1380
01:17:57,007 --> 01:17:58,272
Vincent...

1381
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:01,799
Say my name again,
I'll shove your horn up your ass.

1382
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:06,648
- How long have you known?
- Vincent, I know you're hurt.

1383
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:09,084
I even see why you feel betrayed.

1384
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,137
No one meant to hurt you.

1385
01:18:11,172 --> 01:18:13,081
Quit playing social worker!

1386
01:18:13,116 --> 01:18:14,955
How long have you known?

1387
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,083
It's your mom and your best friend.

1388
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:21,092
I see why it's hard to accept,
but I have nothing to say about it.

1389
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:25,263
She's right.
It wasn't up to her to say it.

1390
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:27,766
It was up to you.

1391
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:32,274
Your mother wasn't ready.
She thought you wouldn't understand.

1392
01:18:32,309 --> 01:18:33,639
That's another matter.

1393
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:37,708
With anybody else, I don't care.
It would be the same.

1394
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:40,214
What?
He's sleeping with Mom!

1395
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:43,446
Stop it with the "Mom, mom".
Grow up!

1396
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:45,219
You're not 8 anymore.

1397
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,079
Your mother loves another man.
So?

1398
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:51,224
Dad should've quit smoking!

1399
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,786
I've been Claude's friend
for 30 years.

1400
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:58,125
Not a day went by
without a call, or a letter.

1401
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,570
All those nights
we spent talking...

1402
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,070
How could you?

1403
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:10,377
How?

1404
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:17,213
Babu...

1405
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:22,280
Try to understand,
it wasn't against you.

1406
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,717
It was his secret, that's all.

1407
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:29,863
Maybe he just needed time.

1408
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:32,196
It takes two to make a secret.

1409
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:38,398
I'm telling Claude
I wished I were that person.

1410
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,437
- I always tell him all.
- Nobody tells all. Nobody.

1411
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:46,248
Everyone has secrets,
moments we don't share.

1412
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:48,716
- Chunks of hidden life.
- He knows all.

1413
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,717
The good, the bad.

1414
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:55,121
Giving birth, the kids' problems,
the hurts, the tears! All of it!

1415
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:00,094
- Even when you had that thing.
- What? Are you crazy?

1416
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:01,428
What?

1417
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,099
That's intimate?
Private? Personal?

1418
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:11,603
What good are friends
if you can't tell them what matters?

1419
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:15,541
I often wanted to tell you,
but I couldn't.

1420
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:17,372
Then why did you tell Anna?

1421
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,214
Babu, he didn't tell me.

1422
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:23,952
No one told me anything.
I just found out.

1423
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:26,655
You found out?
What are you, a medium?

1424
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:28,179
There was no confiding.

1425
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:32,594
Anna found us one day
in the pool...

1426
01:20:32,629 --> 01:20:34,221
Stop it, stop it!

1427
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:41,069
I was afraid you wouldn't
understand the love...

1428
01:20:41,104 --> 01:20:43,196
Franחoise and I have shared.

1429
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:47,234
- Franחoise is...
- Stop!

1430
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:52,546
You're speaking of my mother!

1431
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:56,214
Mom, who took care of you
at La Castide, as a kid.

1432
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:58,347
Made your snacks.

1433
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:02,391
Gave you presents. Henri's wife,
my mother. Ring a bell?

1434
01:21:02,426 --> 01:21:05,824
- You're torturing yourself!
- I will ifl feel like it!

1435
01:21:05,859 --> 01:21:09,222
- You can't understand...
- What can't I understand?

1436
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:13,735
Dad loved you so much.
Defending you, feeling sorry for you.

1437
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:15,896
That kills me. Know what?

1438
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:19,900
You disgust me.

1439
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:22,210
Vincent, calm down or leave.

1440
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:24,645
I'm leaving.

1441
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,678
No! Calm down and stay!

1442
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:30,719
You wanted him to talk.
Now we listen.

1443
01:21:30,754 --> 01:21:33,085
Vincent! Vincent!

1444
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:56,736
Every single day
I think of your father.

1445
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,083
I keep seeing that moment...

1446
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:06,587
your parents at the instant
I first saw them.

1447
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:10,281
In the apartment
on Rue Monge.

1448
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:13,756
Before Christmas. Your dad
on a stool, hanging ornaments...

1449
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,698
on a huge tree.

1450
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,194
He was trying to.
It was a catastrophe.

1451
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:22,463
Franחoise laughing.

1452
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:25,265
They were so good together,
it was incredible.

1453
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,969
It was truly magical.

1454
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,071
Something I had never seen before.

1455
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,507
That day, your parents took me in.

1456
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:38,747
You all did.

1457
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,882
Babu became my best friend.

1458
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,954
An extension of myself.

1459
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,363
Vincent, you protected me.

1460
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:53,458
You always teased me,
always kept your distance...

1461
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,529
but you did it like a brother.

1462
01:22:57,739 --> 01:23:00,040
Franחoise got me into music.

1463
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:02,066
All those years, helping me along.

1464
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:07,215
Thanks to her, I became someone.

1465
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:13,410
Right after Henri's death,
it all changed.

1466
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:22,524
It all came to the surface.

1467
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,202
I knew that...

1468
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,139
I loved a woman
I had no right to love.

1469
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,072
I stopped seeing her.
For you.

1470
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:38,841
I had to forget her.

1471
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:45,118
So, I needed to get away.
I said yes to any tour.

1472
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:46,920
And I left.

1473
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,081
For Canada.

1474
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:52,215
I was running away.

1475
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:57,764
Franחoise thought Henri's death
had driven me away...

1476
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:01,064
that I didn't care for her anymore,
that I threwit all over.

1477
01:24:04,306 --> 01:24:05,796
It was just the opposite.

1478
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:09,601
I really tried to forget her...

1479
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,011
to drive herfrom my thoughts.

1480
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,777
But as months went by,
I was wasting away.

1481
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:18,718
I couldn't play. I quit.

1482
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,744
I came back to Paris,
I was going crazy.

1483
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:24,682
One evening...

1484
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,885
in the middle of a concert...

1485
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:31,465
right in the orchestra pit...

1486
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,801
my hands started shaking.

1487
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,104
I lost it.

1488
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:49,375
I got in the car and drove
straight to La Castide.

1489
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:53,046
I had to see her, to speak to her.

1490
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:55,881
I had to let it out.

1491
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:05,627
I arrived at dawn.

1492
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:09,561
A fog enveloped the house.
You couldn't see 6 feet.

1493
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:14,539
There was a clanging.
The sound of a door.

1494
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:17,838
And Franחoise appeared.

1495
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:21,611
She didn't look surprised.

1496
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,352
She waved me over,
like she'd been expecting me.

1497
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:38,763
Like she'd always expected me.

1498
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,303
We stood there...

1499
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,932
I don't know, maybe a minute,
in the cold, face to face.

1500
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:52,340
I was a wreck.

1501
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:56,049
Exhausted, but...
I felt all right.

1502
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,246
I was where I belong.

1503
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,071
Understand?

1504
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,602
You understand what I felt?

1505
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:30,684
It was stark, so simple.
It was obvious.

1506
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:37,081
The rain started to fall.

1507
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:40,084
Raindrops on Franחoise's face.

1508
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,095
Streaming like tears.

1509
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,621
Or else maybe they were tears.

1510
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:47,431
It was beautiful.

1511
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:50,304
Then...

1512
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:54,469
Franחoise took my hand,
and she said:

1513
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:56,310
Come.

1514
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:57,511
"Come."

1515
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:04,085
I want you.

1516
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,600
"I want you."

1517
01:27:05,635 --> 01:27:07,080
Shut the fuck up!

1518
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:11,281
- Claude!
- Oh shit!

1519
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:14,095
Vincent!
What is wrong with you?

1520
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:15,926
Claude, let me see.

1521
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,967
You chipped a tooth.

1522
01:27:24,002 --> 01:27:26,099
Great! Thanks a lot.

1523
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,674
Now you'll get a visit
from the tooth fairy.

1524
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:34,547
What's going on, Mom?

1525
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:38,246
Nothing. Uncle Claude
tripped on the tablecloth.

1526
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:41,745
- It's noisy.
- Then wear earplugs!

1527
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,880
Calmed down yet?

1528
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:47,629
You realize what you did?
What a state you're in!

1529
01:27:47,664 --> 01:27:49,631
Telling me so
won't calm me down!

1530
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:52,032
Right. I can't say a word!

1531
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,669
- Fine, Anna.
- What you just did isn't fine!

1532
01:27:54,704 --> 01:27:56,903
It's nothing, Anna.

1533
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,973
He decked you, don't defend him!
Maybe you're OK, I'm not!

1534
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:02,431
I want him to apologize.
He will.

1535
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:04,044
Yeah? Or else?

1536
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:06,865
You want to play that?
Look out.

1537
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:09,475
He should apologize.
He started it!

1538
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:12,051
Started it?
Can you hear yourself?

1539
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,447
That can't be you talking!

1540
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:17,682
Not the man I've lived with
for 2 years. The man I love.

1541
01:28:18,093 --> 01:28:20,093
You get that I'm in love?

1542
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:24,632
That's why I've tried for an hour
not to hate you. But it's hard!

1543
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:27,534
You like me childish,
selfish, making faces?

1544
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:30,402
- I'm expecting your child?
- So you say.

1545
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:32,472
What?

1546
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:36,258
- Any more revelations?
- I never lied about us.

1547
01:28:36,293 --> 01:28:39,375
How do I know?
I'm Thomas, I believe what I see.

1548
01:28:39,581 --> 01:28:43,449
- Keep it up, you won't see your son.
- Right, give me a break.

1549
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:45,686
Think it's funny?

1550
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:57,254
What?
You want me to apologize?

1551
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:01,435
Yes.

1552
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:04,963
OK. Claude, sorry for decking you,
though you deserved it.

1553
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:09,177
Sorry you took it hard,
but I don't need your permission.

1554
01:29:09,212 --> 01:29:10,777
We got that.

1555
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:13,280
Franחoise and I are both adults.

1556
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:15,215
She sure is.

1557
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:17,752
- Vincent!
- A 30 year age difference!

1558
01:29:17,787 --> 01:29:18,919
26.

1559
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,187
I see why Franחoise
wouldn't tell you.

1560
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:25,126
- You discussed it?
- Of course. Dozens of times!

1561
01:29:25,161 --> 01:29:28,229
I said: "Trust them.
They'll understand".

1562
01:29:28,264 --> 01:29:30,094
I was wrong!
Look at you!

1563
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:33,600
Stop yelling now.

1564
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:36,396
The kids are in bed,
I'm going too.

1565
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:05,894
Hello?

1566
01:30:09,304 --> 01:30:11,204
Yes, I'll put her on.

1567
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:17,574
Babu, it's your mom.

1568
01:30:25,053 --> 01:30:26,253
Hi, Mom.

1569
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,780
Listen...
Really great.

1570
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,719
The mood was very high.

1571
01:30:33,228 --> 01:30:34,786
Dinner was delicious.

1572
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:39,032
Yes, I followed your recipe.

1573
01:30:39,067 --> 01:30:42,059
Loved it.
I'm holding the empty platter.

1574
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:47,602
The raisins, no.
Not swollen, not shriveled.

1575
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:50,877
Maybe a little squashed now,
on the rug.

1576
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:55,109
Why?
It's sort of a long story.

1577
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:58,777
After Vincent told us
he's naming his son after Hitler...

1578
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:00,220
The dictator, Mom.

1579
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:02,689
Then he and Anna,
who arrived an hour late...

1580
01:31:02,724 --> 01:31:05,591
said they thought our
kids' names were ridiculous.

1581
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,186
You might say, no big deal compared
to Moka's murder. But hey!

1582
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,565
Moka, Mom.
B.B.'s dog.

1583
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:14,801
Right.

1584
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:19,307
I forgot! Your darling son,
who hates the Rosenthals...

1585
01:31:19,342 --> 01:31:22,299
will be there
on the 36th and 37th.

1586
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,606
Although now that he broke
your lover's nose, maybe not.

1587
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:29,405
Claude, Mom.

1588
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,946
How many have you got?

1589
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:35,422
I'll put him on.

1590
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:39,292
It's Mom.

1591
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,128
Yes?

1592
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:49,202
All right.

1593
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:54,274
Yes and no.

1594
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:57,244
More no, actually.

1595
01:31:57,812 --> 01:31:59,541
I'll call you back.

1596
01:32:00,782 --> 01:32:02,113
Right.

1597
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:14,089
Me, too.

1598
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:30,440
Franחoise will be
in Paris tomorrow.

1599
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:33,342
Faster than for
her grandchildren.

1600
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:37,048
Babu, call back and apologize.

1601
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:43,725
Apologize? You want me
to tell my mom I'm sorry?

1602
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,024
Listen...

1603
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:47,084
And me?
Who apologizes to me?

1604
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:50,128
Who will it be?

1605
01:32:50,832 --> 01:32:53,199
- Will you?
- But I...

1606
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:56,498
Why look so stricken?
I'm crazy, too? That it?

1607
01:32:56,533 --> 01:32:59,762
Or body language so they think
you're bewildered?

1608
01:33:02,009 --> 01:33:05,172
You just go wide-eyed
and you're off the hook?

1609
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:11,843
You should see your face.

1610
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,288
Same as school kids cheating.

1611
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:17,957
The text book is open
in their lap...

1612
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:21,060
the math formula
is written on their palm.

1613
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:24,258
But those eyes say:
"I don't know what you mean".

1614
01:33:24,499 --> 01:33:26,467
What can I say?

1615
01:33:27,135 --> 01:33:30,036
No idea what I'm getting at?
Nothing occurs to you?

1616
01:33:31,239 --> 01:33:35,176
I don't know. Start with
how I sacrificed my thesis...

1617
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:36,876
so you could write yours.

1618
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:39,447
While busy with Montaigne,
who graded your papers?

1619
01:33:39,482 --> 01:33:40,780
Prepped your classes?

1620
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:44,251
True, I had maternity leave
so I had lots of time!

1621
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:47,716
The children.
Let's talk about them.

1622
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:51,225
Who begged me to have them,
cause they're a blessing?

1623
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,895
You never care for them.
Yes, you do!

1624
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:55,595
That's not fair.

1625
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:59,225
Sunday nights, at times,
you play with them for 15 minutes.

1626
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:02,099
Get them all wired.

1627
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,400
Right before bedtime.

1628
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,291
Then I get them,
overexcited, sweating...

1629
01:34:07,326 --> 01:34:09,909
book bags to prepare,
stories to tell...

1630
01:34:09,944 --> 01:34:13,147
pee-pee, nightmares.
You're in your study because...

1631
01:34:13,182 --> 01:34:16,412
Seriously,
those brats get tedious.

1632
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:19,954
I'd like to have time to read
nowand then, too.

1633
01:34:19,989 --> 01:34:21,888
But no!
Babu can't.

1634
01:34:21,923 --> 01:34:23,788
No, Babusky doesn't have time.

1635
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:26,225
What good would it do me?

1636
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:30,029
You never took me along
to a conference.

1637
01:34:30,631 --> 01:34:34,089
Because in truth,
you're ashamed of me, too.

1638
01:34:35,102 --> 01:34:38,122
My little job, little school,
in a little suburb.

1639
01:34:38,157 --> 01:34:41,107
Nothing to crow about,
the poorly dressed wife!

1640
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:45,408
With her big ass, 50 lbs. Heavier
since the kid was born!

1641
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:48,211
So who will apologize to me?

1642
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,219
Who will apologize to me?

1643
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,425
Not you, Pierre.

1644
01:35:00,962 --> 01:35:02,190
I can see that.

1645
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:09,735
Claude, I have nothing to tell you.
You know it all already.

1646
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:12,697
Though it's a one-way street.

1647
01:35:14,008 --> 01:35:15,600
As for you, Anna...

1648
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:21,080
I won't say anything.
You and I never found much to say.

1649
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:27,180
You, Vincent.

1650
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,616
The words I long to hear?

1651
01:35:31,092 --> 01:35:33,794
Will you admit
you got away with murder?

1652
01:35:33,829 --> 01:35:36,462
Mommy's little boy.
Daddy's little clown.

1653
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:40,092
Allowed to suck in school,
leave the table without permission.

1654
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:43,271
Answer back, sleep over!
Who was allowed anything!

1655
01:35:43,306 --> 01:35:45,306
Because Vincent's so much fun!

1656
01:35:45,341 --> 01:35:47,365
And girls just adore him!

1657
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:50,338
Must be hard being
a little playboy.

1658
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:54,237
Poor darling, he shouldn't
get worn out clearing the table.

1659
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:57,608
Your sister will do that.

1660
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:00,213
Don't you worry, my big boy.

1661
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:05,058
She won't mind. She likes
playing maid, your oafish sister.

1662
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:07,593
No worries, Vinny boy.

1663
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:10,961
Screw up all you want.
We forgive you in advance.

1664
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:12,622
Well?

1665
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:14,596
Get the picture?
Yes?

1666
01:36:14,902 --> 01:36:16,102
No?

1667
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:18,466
No apology on the horizon?

1668
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,868
Perfect.

1669
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:22,570
That's fine.

1670
01:36:24,078 --> 01:36:25,340
We're all the same then.

1671
01:36:26,581 --> 01:36:28,208
No apologies tonight.

1672
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:35,217
My bitterness, my sorrow, my
hard feelings and I are turning in.

1673
01:36:35,923 --> 01:36:37,590
You do the dishes for once.

1674
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:41,629
Pierre, stay on that couch.
If the kids cry, you get it.

1675
01:36:41,664 --> 01:36:44,359
I'll take a handful of Ativan
and sleep 2 days.

1676
01:36:44,498 --> 01:36:46,625
Go fuck yourselves
and good night.

1677
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:58,603
I just made one joke.

1678
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:06,186
Well...

1679
01:37:06,387 --> 01:37:08,048
I'm going home.

1680
01:37:10,091 --> 01:37:11,581
You're OK?

1681
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:13,159
I'm great.

1682
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,460
I'll drive you, Claude.

1683
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,020
I'm taking your car, get a cab.

1684
01:37:17,965 --> 01:37:19,165
Excuse me?

1685
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,934
That a problem?

1686
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:30,034
See you tomorrow if you're calm.
Otherwise forget it.

1687
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:07,080
- I'm dreaming.
- Vincent...

1688
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:08,844
Did you hear her?

1689
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:17,113
She wants to have the kid alone?
Fine. Let me laugh.

1690
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:20,787
- Want some?
- Yes.

1691
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:23,294
Explain something to me.

1692
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:26,267
Why do women all adore that guy?

1693
01:38:26,302 --> 01:38:27,467
I don't know.

1694
01:38:28,169 --> 01:38:30,296
- Musician?
- A trombone player.

1695
01:38:31,138 --> 01:38:33,072
The trombone, come on.

1696
01:38:33,274 --> 01:38:35,208
It's for marching bands.

1697
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:40,075
Truly disgusting.

1698
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:44,207
Small and drab,
just like him.

1699
01:38:45,152 --> 01:38:48,121
He's a total bore.
Ever hear him crack a joke?

1700
01:38:50,825 --> 01:38:52,122
- No.
- So.

1701
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:55,723
Typical step-father.

1702
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:09,342
Holy shit.

1703
01:39:10,077 --> 01:39:11,277
Holy shit.

1704
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:15,045
Just imagine,
Mom is sleeping with the plum.

1705
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:18,384
Any luck, they won't have kids.

1706
01:39:22,223 --> 01:39:23,884
I'm going to see Babu.

1707
01:39:26,894 --> 01:39:29,475
- Hey, you stay.
- I'll go to a hotel.

1708
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:32,057
Don't be silly.
Stay and help me clean up.

1709
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,298
You're good at sweet-talk.

1710
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:37,297
You'll see, it's a good couch.

1711
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:40,062
Sleep on it often?

1712
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:43,935
Now and then.

1713
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:55,248
- No.
- What?

1714
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,716
Fantastic!

1715
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:03,929
- Give me your eternal gratitude?
- No.

1716
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:07,195
I'll lend it to you.
I'm a tightwad, don't forget.

1717
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:15,033
- Couscous in your hair.
- Whose fault is that?

1718
01:40:18,412 --> 01:40:21,575
- Sorry about the table.
- That's nothing.

1719
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:24,117
Only wood.

1720
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,211
You could make Pick-up Sticks.

1721
01:40:32,259 --> 01:40:33,459
Right.

1722
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:43,870
- Night, Sancho.
- Night, asshole.

1723
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:47,964
- Sancho!
- What?

1724
01:40:50,344 --> 01:40:53,939
Did you know
Gary Grant was a homosexual?

1725
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:58,073
Yes. And it's Cary.
Cary Grant.

1726
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:02,055
With a "C", as in "Cari-bou".

1727
01:41:03,824 --> 01:41:05,257
Night, Mr. Know-Nothing.

1728
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:11,094
Sancho!

1729
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:15,129
What now?

1730
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,230
I just wanted to say...

1731
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:21,138
you know, we all have
our little problems.

1732
01:41:35,623 --> 01:41:37,189
That night...

1733
01:41:37,224 --> 01:41:40,591
my head heavy from mixing
fine and crappy wine...

1734
01:41:40,626 --> 01:41:43,958
my back pulverized
by Pierre's couch of torture...

1735
01:41:44,131 --> 01:41:47,760
as I read the first pages
of Benjamin Constant's novel...

1736
01:41:47,968 --> 01:41:51,631
I had no doubt our family
had reached a point of no-return.

1737
01:42:00,381 --> 01:42:02,081
But life went on.

1738
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:05,703
4 months and 6 days later,
Anna's water broke...

1739
01:42:05,738 --> 01:42:09,290
at a crucial board meeting,
with those same Koreans.

1740
01:42:09,325 --> 01:42:10,290
I'm sorry, I must go.

1741
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:14,461
Babu, Pierre, Mom, and Claude
all rushed to the clinic...

1742
01:42:14,496 --> 01:42:16,588
to meet our new son.

1743
01:42:17,564 --> 01:42:20,100
Push... Stop pushing!

1744
01:42:20,135 --> 01:42:21,863
Blow!

1745
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:24,100
Scissors... Quickly.

1746
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:26,038
Quickly.

1747
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,142
- What's going on?
- Don't worry.

1748
01:42:28,177 --> 01:42:29,541
Is there a problem?

1749
01:42:35,115 --> 01:42:37,879
Everything's fine, just fine.

1750
01:42:38,085 --> 01:42:39,285
Don't worry.

1751
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:42,089
Your little girl is gorgeous.
She's fine.

1752
01:42:42,124 --> 01:42:44,717
We'll clean her up and bring her in.

1753
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:51,430
Fuck.

1754
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:58,701
After thanking hospital staff...

1755
01:42:58,973 --> 01:43:03,110
Years of medical school,
you can't tell a boy from a girl?

1756
01:43:03,145 --> 01:43:04,710
Did the redhead
get his glasses yet?

1757
01:43:04,745 --> 01:43:07,981
Needing a coat of pink paint
for the blue room...

1758
01:43:08,016 --> 01:43:11,183
needing to purchase
all the baby's things again...

1759
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:14,388
we were never the less ecstatic,
hugging this new life...

1760
01:43:14,423 --> 01:43:16,088
when we had a revelation.

1761
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:18,091
What's the little marvel's name?

1762
01:43:20,094 --> 01:43:21,294
Fuck!

1763
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:24,564
Don't worry, you have time.

1764
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,790
I'll be back.

1765
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,402
We no longer had a name.

1766
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:38,169
There we were, wrung out,
all caught up short...

1767
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:40,379
and Anna got the idea.

1768
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:43,178
The right idea.
The one that had to be.

1769
01:43:43,317 --> 01:43:47,253
Proving the mother of my child
is truly a wonderful woman.

1770
01:43:55,429 --> 01:43:57,260
- Well?
- Well?

1771
01:44:05,139 --> 01:44:07,801
The good news is the baby is fine.

1772
01:44:09,176 --> 01:44:10,700
The bad news...

1773
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,345
is it's a girl.

1774
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,041
And she is gorgeous!

1775
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:19,518
You scared me!

1776
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:25,248
A little girl cutems!

1777
01:44:25,492 --> 01:44:28,395
- Is she pretty?
- Ravishing!

1778
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:30,386
- Howbig?
- 7 pounds.

1779
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:33,289
And her name?

1780
01:44:35,002 --> 01:44:36,202
Plum!

1781
01:44:40,474 --> 01:44:42,203
You wouldn't!

1782
01:44:43,343 --> 01:44:44,610
No.

1783
01:44:44,645 --> 01:44:47,375
Actually, her name is Franחoise.

1784
01:44:47,915 --> 01:44:49,448
You bastard!

1785
01:44:49,483 --> 01:44:51,583
Mom gave me a big hug...

1786
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:55,089
Babu had tears in her eyes,
Pierre cried for joy.

1787
01:44:55,124 --> 01:44:56,255
It was Anna's idea.

1788
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:58,192
Claude shook my hand and said:

1789
01:44:58,227 --> 01:45:00,059
"Wonderful idea, Vincent".

1790
01:45:00,094 --> 01:45:04,264
That's when, on my
friend-turned-step-father's face...

1791
01:45:04,299 --> 01:45:06,289
I thought I saw a frown.

1792
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:10,534
Well, not a frown.

1793
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:14,206
More like a little pout.

1794
01:45:16,743 --> 01:45:18,040
WHAT'S IN A NAME?

1795
