3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,356
Sir, do you still remember me?

4
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,714
Let me think

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,231
Have I changed so much?

6
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,154
Let me think again

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,354
Marquis Bardata

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,950
I was unlucky some time ago

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,512
Bardata is a very interesting place

10
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,116
I am excited again

11
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,473
Where is your good spirit?
Disappeared?

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,390
What an annoying loss to those who attend the salon.

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,833
But I have seen

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,479
Many countries since...

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,676
With worse customs

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,431
But I still miss them

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,230
Sir, I am annoying you?

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,958
I will wait for Mrs Blayac in the salon.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,196
She is powdering her nose

20
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,035
I think Mr Blayac should not be forgotten

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,068

22
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,992
Go home... but...

23
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,592
You are in a dither, you have bright eyes

24
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,749
Don't move

25
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,190
You might need an arm

26
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,198
The father has a fever

27
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,709
The King, one says, cures those who he touches. 

28
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,710
We can all do miracles

29
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,439
Don't you believe me?

30
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,638
I'll make a promise

31
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,310
We'll get rid of these fevers

32
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,198
By saying mass?

33
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,190
No

34
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,396
With dykes and canals

35
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,835
Planting trees

36
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,230
You will see, this place will become beautiful

37
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,193
There's home

38
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,909
When you see the King have him bless my medal

39
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,113
I promise, Leonard

40
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,196
You need my blessing

41
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,039
Your mother worries about this trip

42
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,832
Keep your hopes up

43
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,753
Yes, in God

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,232
Versailles was built through the will of one man

45
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,232
A King's will

46
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,073
I'm going to Versailles

47
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,196
The King will understand me

48
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,639
The King will listen

49
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,633
On your knees! Your hat!

50
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,754
In the name of the Father and the Son -Amen

51
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,149
Later...

52
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,196
One of the best among us!

53
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,959
And a good sense of humour

54
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,190
Milletail!

55
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,318
Back from America?

56
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,074
I missed Versailles Mr De Bellegarde.

57
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,398
I am surprised to see you

58
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,435
I would have preferred to bury him alive

59
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,196
But God needs us

60
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,630
Attention please, sirs

61
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,916
Let us dine instead!

62
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,395
We'll do better next to the fowl.

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,958
The Blayacs are suffering a crisis of austerity

64
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,275
Is this Mr Blayac's house?

65
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,278
Are you family?

66
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,833
He invited me to come here

67
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,270
You came at the right moment. he is receiving guests

68
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,956
You can recognize his widow very easily

69
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,076
We cannot forget his wisdom and ability

70
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,196
My husband admired you

71
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,953
The Academy is in mourning

72
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,958
He was so devoted to it

73
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,633
What a loss!

74
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,313
My God!

75
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,034
My condolences, he was a friend of my father.

76
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,633
Mine as well

77
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,193
I come from Dombes

78
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,591
Have you ever been to Versailles?

79
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,070
I happened to have been born here

80
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,832
Courtier by birth!

81
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,389
One may be born in a stable and not be a horse

82
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,712
Only God can judge us

83
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,636
You said?
God only...

84
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,718
God forgives thieves...

85
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,393
when their children are hungry

86
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,078
Since we met each other

87
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,713
Who is the most pleasant?

88
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,556
Who do I have the honour to bleed?

89
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,356
Gregoire
Ponceludon de Malavoy.

90
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,077
Marquis de Bellegarde. Charlotte,
my Nanny.

91
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,753
And his son Paul

92
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,073
Paul is a deaf mute. He is an idiot not a bad person.

93
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,519
Travellers have not been cautious enough

94
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,473
To resist the crime that reigns around Versailles.

95
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The Doctor judges blood...

96
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,309
Nice lively red

97
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,192
Fluid but with a good body.

98
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,079
You are living outdoors... 

99
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
and you eat lean meat.

100
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,955
I live in marsh air and I fish.

101
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,712
Ah?

102
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,393
My God, my plans!

103
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,638
Are you a hydraulic engineer?
Yes, Sir.

104
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,959
I came to submit my plan to drain the marshes.

105
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,278
The difficulty is not in being received
but in being heard.

106
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,956
-I will stick with common sense
They say that Maurepas is a good Minister.

107
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,038
You really don't understand the way things are done in Versailles!

108
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,709
There!

109
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,272
I drained you white

110
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,398
You need rest now

111
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,830
Two days of bed and diet with one glass of wine in the evening. 

112
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,959
The evening is meant for sleep, you hurt uselessly

113
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,835
Thank you

114
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
"Note to the Regent...

115
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
"concerning epidemics in Dombes and a method to remedy the situation",

116
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,956
Written by the Marquis de Gora

117
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,673
Not even opened!

118
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,473
Did your letter fare better?

119
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,432
Thank you Sir, for preventing my humiliation

120
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,159
I have seen many country nobles

121
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,197
I will plead my case clearly

122
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,957
A lock will fill a reservoir and regulate the flow

123
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,190
His majesty might be interested in such a hydraulic project.

124
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,479
The King is amused by technical things

125
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,918
Tell him that malaria is decimating the people of Dombes. I have been told that he is sensitive.

126
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,638
That is his weakness.

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,551
That is why I will not speak of your plans to His Majesty.

128
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,670
In fact, I will hide these plans...

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,232
Whether they describe a tunnel under the English Channel or mapping India.

130
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,356
Very useful proposals

131
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,634
But expensive

132
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,956
At least, let's drain the marsh.

133
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,629
Its money that we'll end up draining.

134
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,992
I respect budgets.

135
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,270
Do you know the present situation?

136
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,756
The cost of living?

137
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,953
It comes after the destiny of France

138
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,478
Except for "philosophers".

139
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,631
Good day Sir, I have work to do.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,956
I will alert the King of the miseries that we hide from him.

141
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,394
Fine.

142
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,479
These gentlemen on the right will lead the Kingdom to bankruptcy.

143
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,200
I am kept busy with military engineering and fortifications.

144
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,839
Mr Maurepas is old and careful.

145
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You are young and passionate.

146
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,755
My responsibility makes me immune to flattery.

147
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,519
In the left wing...

148
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,636
exceptions are not permitted.
Good day, Sir.

149
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,474
But, I will give you some advice:

150
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,997
Write a proposal and I promise you will hear about it.

151
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,475
In the left wing of the palace, we work at the business of the King.

152
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,435
The right wing welcomes the court.

153
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,109
Everyone there tends to their business. 

154
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,470
I wish to see the King and no one else.

155
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,556
"No one else"! You amuse me.

156
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,230
We call you "lobbyists".

157
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,830
How many are you? A thousand?

158
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,592
Some get there.

159
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,994
Help me.

160
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,798
Introduce me to the court.

161
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,795
You'll be more useful to your farmers

162
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,194
Versailles is my last hope.

163
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,315
Everyone's the same!

164
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,597
Heads full of titles, pensions and duties!

165
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,598
The court! The court!

166
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,838
The word will turn you grey!

167
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,878
I doubt that you will succeed in being heard.

168
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,393
Go home.

169
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,228
And thank me.

170
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,156
Excuse me.

171
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,831

172
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,470
Ah yes, the secret!

173
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,594
I tell you:
There is no purgatory!

174
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,394
I believe I recognize your point.

175
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,476
The countryside must sharpen your view on the absurdity of the court.

176
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,474
"Don't judge, and you will not be judged".

177
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,390
If the Gospel had been useful to Versailles I would have known. 

178
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,515
Join us!

179
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,194
We play ten cents a point.

180
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,835
My buckles are all I have.

181
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,191
But...

182
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,278
You can evaluate them better by bending properly.

183
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,919
What do you want?

184
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,238
To be in charge of draining the Dombes marshes.

185
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,756
The farm people only live to 35.

186
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,229
The poor people!

187
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,076
Bad news never travels alone :
It bores us to speak of them.

188
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,799
Other than the mosquitos...

189
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,919
These farmers also feed the aristocracy.

190
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,837
Less stupid than he appears.

191
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,750
That is the difference between us

192
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,432
Her Majesty the Queen!

193
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,879
Ah, Blayac! May I borrow the Abbot?

194
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,158
Your servant, Your Majesty.

195
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,278
I'm in a game of cards, but its nothing but trouble.

196
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,274
I lively spirit would not be too much.

197
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,194
Thank you, my friend, I will return it to you

198
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,590
But... you were busy?

199
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,915
Its of no importance your Majesty.

200
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,915
You recover quickly from the "attack"

201
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,116
Do you care?

202
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,196
Please allow me to hope.

203
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,795
He displays a certain agility for conversation.

204
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,277
You no longer come to my afternoon tea?

205
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,278
If you wish

206
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,311
Do I have to invite you?

207
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,756
Bring your friend.

208
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,629
Double-six!

209
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,756
Your first serve...

210
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,236
can give us hope.

211
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,831
This little Abbot is a friend of the Queen and he hates me.

212
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,270
An open mind opens doors!

213
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,158
You miss nothing.

214
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,231
Who cares about Dombes?

215
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,831
Only you, of course, but patience!

216
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,190
If the court is interested in you,

217
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,832
Then the Dombes have a place at Versailles.

218
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,753
In 8 days I spent year's income!

219
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,116
If you are not comfortable...

220
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,589
I can offer you a place to stay

221
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,359
I wanted to discourage you but you persist so I will help you.

222
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,319
Why are you doing this?

223
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,070
Honesty and intellect can rarely be found together

224
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,956
Too much powder yellows the teeth

225
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,074
Just keep your original skin colour

226
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,674
A little red brightens it.

227
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,154
Does the Countess know the King?

228
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,315
Very serious topics...

229
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,512
Are unpleasant and shouldn't be discussed

230
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,999
I will keep quiet

231
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,636
Be spiritual, delicate

232
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,949
and malevolent.

233
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,112
And your province will improve.

234
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,398
No puns. People despise them at Versailles.
They kill the spirit.

235
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,159
Voltaire, my favourite.

236
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,679
Ah, Voltaire!

237
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,630
Most of all don't laugh at your own jokes!

238
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,519
Oh, gooseberries!

239
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,836
I love gooseberries!

240
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,151
I eat them like Samson kills Philistines!

241
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,319
Gooseberries, we all love them 
and if Samson didn't...

242
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,033
If Samson didn't...

243
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,236
If Samson...uh...

244
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,834
Where is your estate?
In Dombes.

245
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,310
A land of swamps and misery.

246
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,158
That is what brings me here.

247
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,919
The King is...such indigestible points! 

248
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,238
Serve the champagne...

249
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,834
...to Mr Ponceludon.

250
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,277
Baron!

251
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,916
What did you think of the English?

252
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,599
The have a sort of dialogue
that they call "hiouma"...

253
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,955
that makes them laugh ridiculously.

254
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,428
"Hiouma"?

255
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,353
A sort of wit?

256
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,108
Not really.

257
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,557
What do you think it is?

258
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,877
Basically the same thing.

259
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,949
I'm burning with curiosity!

260
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,109
( giggles)

261
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,069
If it makes you laugh,
it has to be wit.

262
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,556
No, "wit" does not describe it,
We don't have an equivalent term in French.

263
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,750
Give us an example, it's easier.

264
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,474
I asked Lord Twickenham how many lovers he had

265
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,758
He answered blandly:

266
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,434
"At what point do we consider them as many?"

267
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,478
This is the only example that comes to mind of English wit.

268
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,716

269
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,519
Drink!

270
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,154
How did Samson kill Philistines?

271
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,956
The Philistines, you recall!

272
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,756
With the jawbone of an ass

273
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,958
With the jawbone of an ass precisely!

274
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,711
"I'd eat as many as Samson killed Philistines"!

275
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,637
With the same jawbone Father?

276
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,236
The jawbone of an ass, therefore!

277
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,756
The court would have loved that word!

278
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,195
Two hours too late!

279
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,669
It?s no fun getting old.

280
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,075
I would not have missed the punch line.

281
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,238
My sense of humour is no longer quick.

282
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,879
No, Ponceludon.

283
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,236
Finally, I congratulate you.

284
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,559
You made a good point with your "To the mouth!"

285
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,831
Too bad you laughed.

286
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,074
A tortoise...

287
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,635
an inkpot...

288
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,795
amethyst...

289
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,752
a porcelain chariot...

290
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,719
a starfish.

291
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,033
A book? No!

292
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,635
Think about it.

293
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,795
A snuffbox!

294
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,598
You are wrong.

295
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,835
Oh, an apple!

296
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,154
How could I forget?

297
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,390
Strange waste of time!

298
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,270
Children have a mind that open and fluid.

299
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,716
As we age...

300
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,719
Our brain becomes calcified.

301
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,639
and...our memory deteriorates.

302
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,908
I class all witticisms:

303
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,839
"Needing attention"
"Alluding sharply"

304
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,554
"puns" and "paradox"

305
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,639
Your "To the mouth!"
is a "Needing attention".

306
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,551
I dreamed my head on the guillotine as the executioner said...

307
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,230
"One good joke and you are free."

308
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,310
We all have dreamed this in the court.

309
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,790
Don't laugh like that, it is vulgar.

310
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,756
(He tries to laugh without a grin)

311
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,234
Mr De Montalieri doesn't like you?

312
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,355
Your letter bothered me.

313
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,670
This place is excellent, Mathilde.

314
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,276
Having been a tutor will be useful to you later.

315
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,719
Sir. de Montalieri is satisfied with the education of his children.

316
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,835
but...

317
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,869
It would be impolite if I overstayed at Madam de Montalieri's.

318
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,756
Sir. de Montalieri...

319
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,919
...will have access twice a month to his wife...

320
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,237
...who cannot refuse without breaking the present agreement.

321
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,715
The rupture of said contract...

322
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,959
...will terminate the alimentary allowance of 2000 per month...

323
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,518
that Sir. de Montalieri has consented to provide to his future wife.

324
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,874
Mathilde, have you carefully considered this?

325
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,758
And the amounts that I have claimed?

326
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,513
For my research.

327
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,953
Are listed in the appendix Madam de Bellegarde.

328
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,715
My future...

329
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,077
for his benefit, I sign.

330
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,839
But I have to add a condition that I am concerned about:

331
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,638
This promise should not...

332
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,994
neither before or after the marriage...

333
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,276
...nor for any reason,

334
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,478
appear in the court.

335
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,559
If it does it shall break our agreement.

336
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,397
Madam de Bellegarde, do you accept these terms?

337
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,873
My daughter does not tolerate the corruption of the court.

338
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,519
Is that not true, Mathilde?

339
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,716
I have not dated this agreement...

340
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,839
Given that Madam de Montalieri is still alive.

341
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,399
How is she?

342
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,029
Yesterday, the unfortunate woman did not recognize me.

343
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,115
Help me!

344
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It is not completely sealed.

345
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,319
Do you know...

346
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,550
...the proper pressure?

347
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,677
3 ounces a square inch. I studied Pascal.

348
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,316
The crab lives under water,
The girl at her parents.

349
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,875
And your people die of fever.

350
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,518
What kind of oil is that? 
Otter oil.

351
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,795
Tar the cuts.

352
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,749
and then,

353
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,836
You had to see it in action.

354
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,239
Please turn around.

355
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,471
Do you love Montalieri?

356
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,394
If I love?
I don't believe in love.

357
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,634
But why this marriage?
Did I have a choice?

358
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,591
Misery or a convent?

359
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,479
My work is very expensive.

360
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,229
One day, you will take a lover.

361
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,759
You may look.

362
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,950
Don't look down!

363
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,197
Now the "volte".

364
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,515
Volte!

365
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,074
Volte!

366
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,276
If only our desires were stronger than a bloodline.

367
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,789
For months I have been waiting for the King.

368
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,079
My family has lost the titles that we have always had.

369
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,514
I have spoken to my cousin, the Archbishop  of Caen.

370
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,516
I believe that I will soon be summoned.

371
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,675
Terrific.

372
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,319
It's very important,

373
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,115
because I should have the title of Executive of the Academy.

374
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,998
A high paying position.

375
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,751
But meanwhile I am poor.

376
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,428
It?s frustrating.

377
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,390
I will sign an IOU.

378
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,677
I'm short of money as well.

379
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,190
If you don't mind my asking,
what are you looking for?

380
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,359
The title of Engineer
to drain the swamps.

381
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,153
Does anyone lobby for you?

382
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,395
No.

383
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,879
From your own desire?

384
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,955
Education and frankness keeps me here.

385
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,439
But it has to also reach the King.

386
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,951
And to do that you must prove your pedigree since 1399.

387
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,837
We are from the House of Savoie.

388
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,958
Not enough to earn "Marquis of Villars".

389
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,758
But we have always used it.

390
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,838
I need written proof...a certificate...

391
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
from Sigismond, the Marquis of Villars,

392
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,433
died in 1507.

393
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,558
Our castle was destroyed by fire around 1680...

394
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,314
Castles are always burning down.

395
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,956
Write to his parish.

396
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,834
Perhaps they kept the certificate of baptism.

397
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,433
Galvani is right. I've already been through it. 

398
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,751
Electricity passes through the souls of animals.

399
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,149
You know,

400
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,838
electricity and the soul could be one and the same.

401
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,113
What fine skin!

402
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,759
One would believe them thighs

403
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,310
You enjoy...

404
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,073
my masterpiece.

405
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,632
This suit is completely crazy!

406
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,798
Mathilde was born when Rousseau published "Emile".

407
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,789
I let her freely choose.

408
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,193
But this marriage?
Is it what she wants?

409
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,952
I told you, no one forces her to do anything.

410
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,355
Thank you.

411
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,074
Sorry.

412
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,036
This is beyond my expectations.

413
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,431
The Duke of Guines has invited us.

414
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,913
Your good spirit has opened doors!

415
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,155
( Paul yells)

416
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,234
Thank you, Paul.

417
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,714
Excuse me Sir, is this boy a deaf mute?

418
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,393
Yes, and remains so.

419
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,760
I can help him.

420
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,194
I have a home for people like him.

421
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,919
They have a kind of language...

422
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,719
He is fine with us.

423
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,951
Let me present myself, Charles Michel de I'Epee.

424
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,999
I am happy to meet you.

425
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,639
If you would excuse me...

426
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,072
Experience and pedigree!

427
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,077
In my family tree:
We are cousins.

428
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,153
My Aunt is a Ballencourt.

429
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,716
Ballencourt...? From Merignac?

430
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,679
 Ballencourt from Tilleul.

431
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,752
That is the same family.

432
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,954
Look at our grandfather.

433
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,552
See his outward appearance.

434
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,033
"Our grandfather"?

435
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,634
His grandfather is undoubtedly similar between the legs.

436
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,758
Your answer, Sir!

437
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,118
The Executive of the Academy will not fall to the weak of heart.

438
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,436
That it will never fall to me,

439
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,991
Then who would be absurd.

440
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,348
Fall to me?

441
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,313
You are skewering the language...

442
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,755
and keeping an eye on the Academy!

443
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,078
Nothing is more normal.

444
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,794
We trust the harem to a eunuch

445
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,314
The guard over there keeps watch on us!

446
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,149
Obviously.

447
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,438
This is a lover's lane.

448
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,636
Our coldness has been noticed.

449
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,676
Act like you are in love.

450
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,516
Think, your most beautiful years...

451
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,518
With an old lecher.

452
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,557
He is a very learned person.

453
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,759
From his lessons, you will perhaps have children. 

454
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,914
I have better things to make than children, don't you?

455
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,029
I try to keep them from dying.

456
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,913
You are missing the point.

457
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,154
Versailles does not save children.

458
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,709
A rotten tree bears no fruit.

459
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,558
Are you done with that?

460
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,069
Almost.

461
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,396
You think I'm cold.

462
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,434
You are young.

463
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,594
You think that you need no one.

464
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,195
The harvest is good, we can go back.

465
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,994
Hurry!

466
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,833
One would say a bee that carries pollen.

467
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,476
These were not seeded.

468
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,912
You don't seem to approve of my marriage.

469
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,278
What is this kind called?

470
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,079
You are not answering.

471
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,792
You are judging me.

472
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,959
Its the fire in your nerves that brings you to me. 

473
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,839
Nothing more.

474
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,717
I forgot my appointment!

475
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,395
We'll start again tomorrow.

476
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,152
It's getting dark.

477
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'll give you the words, you write the poem.

478
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,072
A poem without heart will seriously harm you.

479
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,676
Sometimes a good word comes by accident.

480
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,233
Work kills the inspiration.

481
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,398
Be discreetly courageous.

482
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,230
Watch out for the Abbot. He's a snake.

483
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,312
If he is silent, he is keeping watch on you, 

484
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,317
when he speaks its already too late.

485
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,432
"care...point."

486
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,550
"desire...Eucharist."

487
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,155
Speak!

488
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,319
Alexandrine.

489
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,553
I hoped to see the King here

490
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,072
Listen, speak, and teach me diligently.

491
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,193
Its like Jesus at Mass.

492
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,156
We eat him, we drink him but we never see him.

493
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,998
Very lively!

494
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,554
To you, Baron!

495
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,675
"follow...next."

496
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,270
"health...summer"

497
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,236
May I see your fan?

498
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,833
It comes from Flanders.

499
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,592
What craftsmanship!

500
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,874
State.

501
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,714
An octave.

502
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,835
Always faithful in his behaviour,

503
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,517
Father,

504
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,277
without intending harm,

505
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,714
Could do two words in a row from the heart.

506
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,599
One in winter

507
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,359
Another in summer

508
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,871
I am invited for chocolate from Count d'Artois.

509
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,599
You are leaving us?

510
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,039
The game continues.

511
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,035
Missus!

512
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,959
The Abbot trusts his memory more than his famous spirit.

513
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,270
The price of your discretion?

514
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,393
Don't worry, your method will not be...

515
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,069
...betrayed!

516
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,631
You have to use dolphin skins.

517
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,318
I'll order some.

518
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,039
They come from New France, they will be expensive.

519
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,710
You forgot my property.

520
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,637
I am going to swim here. 
Do you know how to swim?

521
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,874
I'll teach you.

522
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,350
Have you ever seen a drowning? It's horrible.

523
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,638
Don't be afraid of the water.

524
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,913
Its ridiculous. We have boats and bridges. Why swim?

525
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,273
For fun.

526
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,598
There must be carp here.

527
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,558
And the women of the court?

528
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,716
Do they powder their entire body?

529
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,955
Many are married to old monkeys but few can swim.

530
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,672
Do they have a choice?

531
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,994
The "petitioners?...

532
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,716
fight amongst themselves to feed from the hands of Princes.

533
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,233
You have changed.

534
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,397
This farce pleases you.
You are becoming like them.

535
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,549
What are you doing?

536
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,834
One floats thanks to the Archimedes principle.

537
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,953
Just tell me how one swims.

538
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,159
Push away the water with your arms and move your legs like a frog.

539
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,194
I am still convinced that this is against the laws of nature!

540
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I have been here more than an hour and this gentleman is ahead of me.

541
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,959
Your patience is proof of your pedigree.

542
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
They told me that your petition will not be delayed. 

543
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,558
Everything has been prepared.

544
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,796
But...

545
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,756
And the birth certificate?

546
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,756
Look at it too carefully and even the most aristocratic appear common.

547
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,353
Here are your titles,

548
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,192
as permitted by law.

549
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,799
Good luck

550
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,796
I am grateful to you.

551
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,834
It is to the Countess de Blayac

552
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,634
That you should express your gratitude.

553
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,435
A child's godliness is most important.

554
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,318
We neglected her to such an extent.

555
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,036
Your parish will not be forgotten.

556
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,790
I have other business to attend to.

557
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,075
May God be with you.

558
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,280
How can I express my gratitude to you?

559
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,114
I am not happy that you surprised by my charitable work.

560
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,793
Proof of heart.

561
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,592
and discretion.

562
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,874
People say that I am sincere but lack a heart.

563
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,513
To you to judge.

564
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,109
Arts and crafts interest you?

565
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,595
Since you entered.

566
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,238
Discuss with me your plans.

567
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,152
In my region the clay keeps the rainwater on the surface.

568
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,952
in such a way that ...

569
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,034
Nothing but mud in my foyer!
And these new machines?

570
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,830
The King is interested but you can explain it to him better that I can.

571
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,875
The fact is that he spoke to me about it.

572
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,078
There is misery everywhere.

573
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,629
I must go. I have overstayed my welcome.

574
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,075
Only the ungrateful abuse their time. 

575
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,594
Sit down please.

576
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,794
And let us talk.

577
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,710
The word is that Miss de Bellegarde is charming.

578
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,872
But no one sees it.

579
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,511
An intimate discussion is more embarrassing than scandalous.

580
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,235
So you think that I am left...

581
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,431
Because I hold you in high regard...

582
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,797
and the desire that you inspire.

583
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,034
You are medieval!

584
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,669
Where is the man with a heart?

585
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,876
What happened to your ideas?

586
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,036
Don't be so cruel

587
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,519
At some other time I might have been flattered by your moves.

588
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,876
It is quite true that my bedroom lead to the King.

589
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,755
You are offending me!

590
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,436
Put aside your pride and accept that we are helping you.

591
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,000
You need to better hide your cover.

592
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,959
I could lose myself without losing respect.

593
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,954
If that is all that you have learned...

594
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,436
You have not wasted your time.

595
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,310
(Paul yells)

596
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,119
Mathilde!

597
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,673
Mathilde!

598
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,150
Mathilde!

599
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,629
Hurry, Paul!

600
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,118
De Beauve got 14 minutes, we'll do better.

601
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,629
Without Paul you'd be dead.

602
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,956
I warned you not to go down there!

603
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,150
"Prohibited"?

604
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,998
Who gives you this right?

605
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,031
My father never dared.

606
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,952
What's it to you if I died?

607
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,594
To lose another wife would kill your husband.

608
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,116
His wife finally died.

609
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,232
You will soon marry.

610
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,069
After a proper period of mourning, of course!

611
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,113
He is kind and patient person 
and his children love me.

612
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,349
If you want to drown your scarecrow, call me!

613
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,076
This marriage is costing me!

614
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,240
You really are cold-blooded.

615
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,710
Stay with the fish.

616
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,111
Give me the helmet!

617
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,870
I will be good and alone when she leaves.

618
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,957
Is there no part of you with hope?

619
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,672
I have no property.

620
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,839
What can I give her? My struggle with malaria?

621
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,998
Great life for a woman!

622
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,756
Only a woman can make you happy.

623
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,836
For her, a man's tears are never funny.

624
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,357
Prepare the grey horse and a riding hat.

625
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,838
The King wishes to see us.

626
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,194
Do we have a chance?

627
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,555
Slight!

628
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,560
Some have been waiting for months!

629
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,879
Like the Baron of Gueret.

630
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,556
I prefer stinking swamps.

631
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,959
"Similarity is between the thighs" pleased Artois.

632
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,315
That was enough?

633
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,708
Yes.

634
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,436
But "Eunichs in the harem" was very popular.

635
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,150
Madam de Ferrasse.

636
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,555
Madam de Blancfagot.

637
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,154
Mr de Tilly.

638
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,678
Mr de Bouchardol of Aiguillere.

639
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,429
Your Eminence...

640
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,677
...d'Artimont.

641
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,114
Mr de Larousseur.

642
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,519
The Abbot of Vilecourt.

643
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,475
Mr de Champvallon.

644
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,359
Mr Ponceludon of Malavoy.

645
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,436
Mistakes are no longer permitted.

646
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,072
A real Jesus!

647
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,153
Baron of Gueret!

648
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,471
Give me your shoe!

649
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,358
I will be ridiculed. Give me a break!

650
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,238
Your shoe!

651
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,192
Rise, you are being observed!

652
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,393
Louis, King of France, remember that the nobles made you King.

653
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,193
The provincial nobles that you humiliate...

654
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,954
that you exile...

655
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,149
while you decorate a red man with medals!

656
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,629
Come, we don't belong here.

657
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,955
The native people are our friends.

658
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,435
Imagine, half-naked with the name "Stinking Bear"!

659
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,394
But look at this man. To him we are ridiculous.

660
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,392
Ah, Madam de Blayac!

661
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,750
We don't see you often enough.

662
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,115
And here is the Abbot of Vilecourt.

663
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,198
Ah yes, "The Eunuch?s harem".

664
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,590
Baron Ponceludon of Malavoy.

665
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,593
People have spoken of you.

666
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,636
Miss. de Clericourt.

667
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,196
There!

668
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,798
Oh it?s nothing. It?s just the idiot Marquis of Bellegarde!

669
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,993
She is here!

670
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,074
Bring her here.

671
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,112
Miss. de Bellegarde!

672
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,354
Your father sings praises of you.

673
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,153
But he has hidden you.

674
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,198
Would you honour the court with your presence?

675
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,076
Madam...

676
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,677
you asked my father to dismiss Paul.

677
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,998
I request that you not do so.

678
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,551
No, the abuse has occurred.

679
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,995
He is just a poor deaf mute.

680
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,994
He will be far better off with his kind.

681
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,838
But he has always been with us.

682
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,909
You haven't come to see me to talk about him.

683
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,599
Thank you.

684
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,234
You have had a great influence on me.

685
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,790
I like your father very much.

686
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,356
I can do much for my friends.

687
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,756
At the right time, I will prove it to you.

688
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,029
Madame... Paul?

689
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,118
What a child!

690
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,952
Forget this.

691
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,791
And how is Mr Ponceludon of Malavoy?

692
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,558
What a great conversationalist!

693
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,439
The best in the world.

694
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,514
Goodbye, madam.

695
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,155
Your father said you were clever.

696
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,189
He forgot to mention your beauty.
You undoubtedly have plenty of spirit?

697
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,874
No, madam.

698
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,273
Paul!

699
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,875
(Bellegarde)
He will do well there.

700
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,118
You once said that these places were prisons.

701
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,030
Abbott de I'Epee changed my mind.
Apparently his home is excellent.

702
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,597
More straw, less beating...

703
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,709
Mathilde! The Countess is firm.
Proper manners oblige me.

704
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,154
Manners!

705
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,796
Why this kind of expression?
Everyone smiles at you.

706
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,230
You are forgetting this Ponceludon!

707
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,756
He saw our cheating.

708
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,596
With one word he could ridicule me before the King.

709
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,998
Don't worry.
But yes!

710
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,872
He will never see the King. I have my plans.

711
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,434
Do you think that I have lost my claws?

712
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,031
What would you think of dinner?

713
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,796
Where we serve ridicule to Mr Ponceludon of Malavoy.

714
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,639
Yes...

715
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,879
This is yours?

716
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,352
The Countess of Blayac cannot make your appointment.

717
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,598
She wishes to play cards with Madam de Lamballe.

718
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,715
Between two hearts a straight line is not the shortest...

719
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,198
Mr engineer, sir.

720
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,790
I will stick to your geometry.

721
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,397
Tomorrow there will be a dinner with good company.

722
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,512
She hopes...

723
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,955
Come by yourself!

724
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,636
Baron!

725
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,032
I have nothing witty to say.

726
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,753
But at 30 
Mathilde will be a widow...

727
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,230
wealthy...

728
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,434
very wealthy!

729
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,311
With her life ahead of her.

730
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,153
...at the battle of Fontenoy,
a young drummer...

731
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,319
who had lost the right side of his brain to a bullet...

732
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,637
had the time to laughingly shout:

733
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,434
"Oh that, but where's my head?"

734
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,635
(Ponceludon smiles.)

735
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,836
There's a funny thing.

736
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,917
A carriage at this time of day?

737
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,949
Its for me.

738
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,876
A fancy appointment I believe?

739
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,474
I will leave a light on. You will put it out. Good evening.

740
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,073
My God!
We are 13 at the table!

741
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,990
We'll need to invite an attendant.

742
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,959
The remedy is worse than the ill.
An attendant among us!

743
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,277
We would be ridiculous!

744
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,350
One of us must leave.

745
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,678
The one with the least pedigree.

746
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,836
I suggest we play a game.

747
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,391
The one who is the least witty before dinner will have to leave.

748
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,634
A good spirited tournament!

749
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,550
The glove is dropped.

750
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,958
May the champions meet!

751
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,311
How is your wife?

752
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,269
Asking a husband about his wife...

753
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,954
is like talking about last year's fashion.

754
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,989
I sleep at Clermont once a month...

755
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,076
In case my wife...

756
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,713
...might be pregnant.

757
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,559
Sleeping with one's husband...

758
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,318
...now there's a pregnant woman's wish!

759
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,231
Why leave Clermont?

760
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,433
High society is as good there as anywhere else.

761
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,116
And bad society is...excellent.

762
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,399
As for me...

763
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,799
I no longer go to women of ill repute.
They are as bad

764
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,194
...as women of good reputation.

765
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,513
It?s easier to die for a woman than to find a woman worth dying for.

766
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,915
Maidens charge a lot for a treasure
that all men have the key to.

767
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,119
Those who bear women's confessions
Almost all become Bishops.

768
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,191
Women have spirit.

769
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,354
When the fisherman is foolish,
the Bishop repents.

770
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,195
Wit can only be...

771
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,475
boring...

772
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,554
To those who have none.

773
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,954
One says that a witty man...

774
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,479
...who keeps quiet...

775
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,593
does not think himself less.

776
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,918
The fool is silent because he can't think.

777
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,949
Don't talk badly about boring people:

778
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,073
The plain gives the mountain its importance. Wait!

779
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,034
Mr Ponceludon has not yet spoken.

780
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,076
Wit is like money:
The less you have the better it is.

781
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,949
"Wit is the opposite of money."

782
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,117
"The less you have, the more you are happy.:
Voltaire.

783
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,798
Its better to understand those who hoard.

784
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,312
The game is over.

785
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,628
I'm starving.

786
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,800
Let me eat with the servants.

787
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,040
One judges a man by his company

788
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,439
You are wrong. Judas had excellent company.

789
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,835
Forgive me for missing your wedding.

790
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,231
You are in such a hurry to leave me?

791
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,590
Yes.

792
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,595
I know, fawning on a man will make him unhappy

793
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,230
Don't abandon your water lilies for me.

794
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,919
Who is talking of abdication? We join forces!

795
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,318
In an estate crushed by debts?

796
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,750
Your dreams will not survive it.

797
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,270
If only I had never met you!

798
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,194
I could have continued pretending that I was not being bought.

799
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,518
The artist is waiting.

800
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,198
After the seance, are we going for a walk?

801
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,116
I want to leave before dark.

802
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,556
Can you not admit your love for me?

803
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,392
We are alike.

804
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,114
We sacrifice everything for our plans.

805
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,678
(He remembers) 
Can you not admit your love for me?

806
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,920
You are medieval!
Where is the man with a heart?

807
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,196
You have changed. You are becoming like them.

808
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,430
You would be more useful at home.

809
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,276
Bad luck never comes alone.
They bore me.

810
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,238
Our funds are drying up.

811
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,277
This marriage costs me.

812
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,358
I have seen enough provincial aristocrats.

813
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,150
"pretentiousness...

814
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,874
"in the century of Marot...

815
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,592
Gifts of God pass as lotteries.

816
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,036
He gives attention to the Great Lords,

817
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,679
Sometimes bringing aristocratic amusement,

818
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,351
"And who is the most,

819
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,034
"boils the pot.

820
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,718
But, this days are over,

821
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,359
"where one good word,

822
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,274
stanza or octet,"

823
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,795
"We paid his part."

824
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,312
What are you doing here?

825
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,949
You have given up a pension of 2000 pounds?
Have you lost your mind!

826
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,799
I am terminating my contract

827
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,873
In a fit of emotion?

828
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,634
Ask Montalieri's forgiveness.

829
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,516
No, my decision is firm.

830
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,359
I cannot imagine marrying Montalieri.

831
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,391
It's Ponceludon, isn't it?

832
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,440
The timber is gone.

833
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,635
I sold the 100 acres of woodland.

834
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,398
I had to buy a horse and rebuild the bridge.

835
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,593
My poor Gregoire!

836
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,797
You will inherit nothing but ruins.

837
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,676
Tell me about Versailles.

838
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,753
Did you see the King?
He is very busy but likeable...

839
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,991
...to everyone.

840
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,112
Leonard has a fever.

841
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,190
Since when?

842
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,113
About two weeks ago. He drank swamp water.

843
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,754
Did you drink it?

844
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,394
Here, Leonard.

845
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,152
The King blessed it for you.

846
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,069
He wants me to tell you...

847
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,636
that he loves all the children of France.

848
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,790
Now the priest will say the prayers.

849
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,919
And God will hear them.

850
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,115
What does God want
in sending us such a curse?

851
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,436
It would be enough to drain the swamps.

852
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,759
Don't be hard on yourself.

853
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,999
You have selflessly pleaded our case in the court.

854
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,750
Does our cause matter at Versailles?

855
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,356
Yes...

856
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,190
But pray anyway, you never know.

857
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:09,555
"I am everything that is, that has been and will be."

858
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,596
The Egyptians engraved these words...

859
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,109
Believing that there was but one effect...

860
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,113
that we could question its cause.

861
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,679
The universe did not appear to the peasants except...

862
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,432
for a very powerful reason.

863
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,356
Theatre!

864
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,079
We still have the great religions.

865
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,518
...but the initial reason had to be necessarily, perfect!

866
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,871
But you cannot have two perfect beings.

867
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,513
Two does not make one!

868
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,472
The perfect being cannot...

869
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,153
...be divided!

870
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,753
He who is...

871
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,279
cannot change.

872
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,311
Time measures change.

873
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,516
What is perfect does not change.

874
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,792
Unity, immutability, eternity, is...

875
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It's Him! It's God!

876
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,798
"Causa sui"!
His own cause!

877
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,036
Bravo, Vilecourt!
Its clear!

878
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,596
Bravo!

879
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,718
Its really nothing, this evening...

880
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,877
I simply proved the existence of God.

881
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:19,836
But...

882
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,272
I could prove the opposite when it pleases his Majesty.

883
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,915
You will end up in Bastille Prison, "philosopher!"

884
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,560
This was not a work from the heart.

885
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,231
What impiety! Before the King!

886
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,118
A braggart philosopher, I've always said it!

887
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,476
To fail so close to the goal...

888
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,155
Ah, Madam

889
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,756
The King seems morose today.

890
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,672
Will you plead my cause?

891
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,075
Impossible. It had to do with the spiritual!

892
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,078
I don't understand...

893
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,598
the art is in glowing from the place you are.

894
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,116
"More than one woman has been embarrassed in such a manner.

895
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,709
"And you are leaving 

896
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,558
without excusing yourself.

897
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,754
"I'll, let you know that I sacrificed Abbot Vilecourt...

898
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,279
-my confessor-

899
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,358
...uttering these beautiful phrases that tire my entourage...

900
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,034
"to your business.

901
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,000
"I forgive you for having placed my departure in peril...

902
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,151
"If a sign from you can compensate me.

903
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,114
"Our sex...

904
01:09:55,320 --> 01:10:00,348
"would be useless if it couldn't keep an eye on the opinions 
and business of the State.

905
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,835
"I myself have tried it with success.

906
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,949
"For I have been the best at keeping you absent 
from the court of Versailles.

907
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,636
Who is ringing at this hour?

908
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,395
Gregoire Ponceludon of Malavoy
asks to see you.

909
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,758
Let him in, quickly!

910
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,313
Its already done.

911
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,316
...The child died in my arms

912
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,914
That is terrible...

913
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,279
To your canals!

914
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,359
To your locks!

915
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,472
Madam...

916
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,719
What are you doing?

917
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,194
You called me?

918
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,834
My heart... that's better.

919
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,555
I'm sorry to bother you, but I was frightened.

920
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,716
The important thing is to be reassured.

921
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,672
Does this happen often?

922
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,109
(He sings a Mozart melody)

923
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,557
I take it that we are all friends here.

924
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,556
Please allow me to leave.

925
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,759
Worry about Madam's heart.
These palpitations concern me.

926
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,515
What are you staring at?
One would think the devil was before the cross.

927
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,239
Mathilde is here?

928
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,793
Miss de Bellegarde?

929
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,228
You were gone...

930
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,789
when she left Montalieri.

931
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,599
What a schemer!

932
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,878
Patience...you are in no position to complain.

933
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,035
Why is the deaf mute such an isolated being?

934
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,953
He can't communicate with others?

935
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,598
Is he not moved by objects, like us?

936
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,117
How annoying!
Why does he remain stupid?

937
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,230
...when we become smart?

938
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:55,194
"In the beginning was the Word"!

939
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,636
Plato told Socrates:

940
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,118
"If we lose our voice, but want to describe things,

941
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,756
"we will try like the mutes,

942
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,349
"to point them out with hands, with the head...

943
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,789
"and the body".

944
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,994
For example, Simon...

945
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,676
...son of a businessman, 25 years old,

946
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,512
born deaf and dumb.

947
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,275
He came here when he was 15 years old

948
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,919
Thanks to sign language, he can read...

949
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,399
...write, count...

950
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,358
He is a talented artist.

951
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,354
Here is, Antoine, Pierre...

952
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,836
...Therese, 19 years old.

953
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,959
She can calculate to four places in her head!

954
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,639
She is very devout.

955
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,830
(sneers.)

956
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,076
This is Paul, 17 years old... 

957
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,394
an exceptional subject!

958
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,358
He could sign...

959
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,717
...in less that two months and he already converses!

960
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,793
Soon I will join...

961
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,115
...Therese and Paul, before God.

962
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,113
You mock the marriage of these beings!

963
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,950
I have seen "Romeo and Juliet"...

964
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,911
played by a monkey and a cocker spaniel!

965
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,358
Will the newlyweds at least be able to tell time?

966
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,278
Three minutes have passed.

967
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,914
Bravo, Paul!

968
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,799
Louder! He can't hear you.

969
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,469
Ask him Father, what is a violin?

970
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,353
"Watteau preferred seeing it over hearing it."

971
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,992
Do they feel?

972
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,479
their condition?

973
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,749
What did he say?

974
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,755
It's hard to translate. It comes from within him!

975
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,998
How does one say "Bravo!" in your language?

976
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,354
Like this!

977
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,799
Rise my friend!

978
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,510
Here is signor Panella!

979
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,835
You need a suit for court. 

980
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,029
But I need nothing!

981
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,559
Tomorrow at 11, be at the bottom of the Diana Staircase.

982
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,994
You will see the King and his courtiers

983
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,599
Your game.

984
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,994
I must leave, signor Panella.

985
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,431
That is very nice...

986
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:40,950
(The King) Madam de Blayac,
is he the one you were mentioning?

987
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,076
Mr Ponceludon of Malavoy.

988
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:47,910
That is good. They say that you are a man with much spirit.

989
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,553
-Sire...

990
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,109
The Countess does not waste her praises.

991
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,993
Show me that.

992
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,870
Give us a word, improvise.

993
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,193
For example, describe me.

994
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,554
Sire, the King is not a subject.

995
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,350
The King is not a subject.

996
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,390
Wonderful!

997
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,629
I take it it's a pun.

998
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,189
No, Your Majesty, it's a word play.

999
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,469
This one deserves to stay.

1000
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,472
Join us!

1001
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,358
Come, Mr Ponceludon.

1002
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,911
Come closer, you who are an engineer.

1003
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,993
Well designed, Sire.

1004
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,076
Nevertheless, putting it here...

1005
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,516
We'll keep the gear...

1006
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,113
...raised between the pulleys.

1007
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,719
Now this is an invention!

1008
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,398
What do you think,
Chevernoy?

1009
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,630
So you have an interesting hydrographical project?

1010
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,234
For draining Dombes, Your Majesty.

1011
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,119
Come, tell me about it.

1012
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,553
Talk to my secretary.

1013
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,955
Gentlemen...

1014
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:22,319
Canon-Ponceludon! Both with asses bigger than their mouths.

1015
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,070
Does he like it?

1016
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,353
Your ass is bigger than your mouth!

1017
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,513
Please explain yourself.

1018
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,750
Excuse me. I could not keep myself from seeing you.

1019
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,518
I'm listening.

1020
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,635
Mathilde...

1021
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,878
Whatever happens to me.

1022
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,709
stay my friend.

1023
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,272
Is my friendship so important to you?

1024
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,314
The suit seemed to be watertight. Did you succeed?

1025
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,836
Promise me that you will be careful.

1026
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,829
I didn't know that you left Montalieri.

1027
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,554
Once you knew, did you come?

1028
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,276
You say that I played up to the Countess to see the King?

1029
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,914
If that was the price for the lives of your people, I would have approved.

1030
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,230
Your intelligence is being tested.

1031
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,790
I will try to be direct in the future.

1032
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,353
Why these instruments?

1033
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,392
I am witnessing a duel tomorrow.

1034
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,796
Ponceludon

1035
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,757
and colonel de Chevernoy.

1036
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,914
Mathilde!

1037
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,556
If something happens to you,
I will die.

1038
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,069
Run!

1039
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,314
Go to St Bauzile where I have a house.

1040
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,879
I will meet you there!

1041
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,039
If you don't do it for me do it for your farmers.

1042
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,597
You must live for them.

1043
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,877
Pack my bags.

1044
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,077
Victor, prepare the carriage.

1045
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,914
Don't come back except for the appointment with the King.

1046
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,675
Madame,

1047
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:12,559
"if I am killed, take my hat and my spurs to my mother. 

1048
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,638
Stop over there!

1049
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,550
..."the rest to the poor, except for the formal clothes 
which would only add to their misery.

1050
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,676
..."ridicule to their miseries."

1051
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,397
I am supposed to take you to St Bauzile!

1052
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,919
I know, I know!

1053
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I guarantee that you can return.

1054
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,035
Go!

1055
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,640
"A scheming lover and a venomous provocateur will end up
scattered by a pistol shot.

1056
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,916
Yes, yes...can we shoot?

1057
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,795
"Would I be wrong to believe that fruit comes from a rotten tree?

1058
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:44,239
"A lover regrets nothing.

1059
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,672

1060
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,798
"It is thanks to my courtesy that I recognized you.

1061
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,477
" If you have wasted your time,

1062
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,559
"the memory of you will keep me bitter."

1063
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,354
Apologies not having been made,

1064
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,195
draw lots.

1065
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,315
Chevernoy shoots first.

1066
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,034
We have come here without emotion and now we leave...

1067
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,349
"...without regrets.

1068
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,150
"But I dare believe that between the two...

1069
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,553
"pleasure is less important than friendship."

1070
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,389
(Requiem music)

1071
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,039
Ponceludon has killed Chevernoy.

1072
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,919
He is with you?

1073
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,279
No, Madam, he left the meadow with Miss de Bellegarde.

1074
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,039
He will pay for it!

1075
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,118
I hear visitors!

1076
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,829
- The baroness de Boisjoli...

1077
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:06,079
the baron of Malenval,
Sir Milletail...

1078
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,949
Already!

1079
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,036
They have come to see the show, to see me suffer.

1080
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,350
So then, tell them that I am ill.

1081
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,588
(Baroness) Ill?

1082
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,836
Smallpox?
No.

1083
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,639
She was scorned by a commoner.

1084
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,836
The "commoner" favoured by Louis.

1085
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,956
Soon he will receive us.

1086
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,435
He has made a bad move.

1087
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,196
Where I come from, when a dog is mad, we sound the alarm!

1088
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,153
You bested the Knight of Beauve!

1089
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,593
Take some water, remount!

1090
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,231
I love you, Gregoire!

1091
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,439
(Gregoire laughs.)

1092
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,629
His Majesty cannot receive a man who has killed... 

1093
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,194
one of his officers in a duel...

1094
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,158
...at least not for now.

1095
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,234
We should all clean up our dignity.

1096
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,472
You did your duty.

1097
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,958
You are too strong.

1098
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,833
Versailles can give you nothing
Your estate needs us.

1099
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,309
Why abandon things so close to the goal?

1100
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,233
The more we farm the less there are infections.

1101
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,799
I will see the King.

1102
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,516
My appointment has been postponed.

1103
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,516
You don't belong to them.

1104
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,998
I am very good in the court:

1105
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,549
"Those who love the mysteries of autumn, can easily...

1106
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,030
" See both women and leaves twirling at a party...

1107
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,431
"While idiots stay at the side and wait."

1108
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,119
We have been invited.

1109
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,994
But what if you must pass through the bed of a Countess again?

1110
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,039
Mathilde!

1111
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,158
Tomorrow you will be my shining knight.

1112
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,870
It's the red mouth.

1113
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,518
It's the red mouth.

1114
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,836
May I lend it to you?

1115
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,479
You are wearing my colours...

1116
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,877
...in honour of the pleasures that you gave me?

1117
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,598
The trick!

1118
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,508
Here!

1119
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,358
( He yells. )

1120
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,156
What should we call you?

1121
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,472
Accept the title of...

1122
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,232
"Marquis of Opposites!"

1123
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,429
(Laughs.)

1124
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,034
He deserves such a title.

1125
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,236
Like the people from where he comes from...

1126
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,709
...he dances upside down.

1127
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,878
Marquis of Opposites!
How ingenious!

1128
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,114
Worthy of Voltaire!

1129
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,958
We will know who you are.

1130
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,712
The lover of masquerades...

1131
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,877
...will teach us.
Ha! Ha! Ha!

1132
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,118
Don't bother.

1133
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,630
Tomorrow, children will from the humiliation that surrounds me this evening.

1134
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,556
You wish you had the biting wit of Voltaire!

1135
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,112
He would have been in tears!

1136
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,518
He used ridicule to sensitise us to human suffering.

1137
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,831
Who will be the next victim?

1138
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,799
an idea so witty...

1139
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,036
that another family will face a precarious situation?

1140
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,595
You?

1141
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,394
Perhaps you?

1142
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,236
Unless I'm lucky enough to spit up a good joke in the face of your friend here.

1143
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,829
Sir!

1144
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,239
Take off your mask!

1145
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,719
Everyone wants to know who came up with "Marquis of Opposites"!

1146
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,549
I will return to my decaying estate. I belong there.

1147
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,629
I will build dykes and dig canals.

1148
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,397
I will dig them with my bare hands if I must.

1149
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:53,316
Ah!

1150
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,349

1151
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,109
Wit Sir, is the air that we breathe.

1152
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:06,231
Eloquence that swells from Danton and Saint-Just... 

1153
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,438
has replaced wit.

1154
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,709
Ah!

1155
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,918
You will do well here.

1156
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:16,275
On a clear day we can see the French coast.

1157
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,236
Mathilde et Gregoire have stayed there.

1158
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:27,353
She is helping to drain the Landes...and finally...Dombes.

1159
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,635
I don't know anymore.

1160
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,869
Ah!

1161
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,517
I hope they avoid the storm.

1162
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,992
What are you good at?

1163
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:41,909
I can teach French.

1164
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,151
...sciences...physics...physiology...

1165
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,876
I've lost my hat!

1166
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:49,958
Better than your head!

1167
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,073
"Hiouma"?

1168
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,435
Ah, humour?

1169
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,439
Its wonderful!

1170
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
