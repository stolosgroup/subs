3
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,796
Oh, no.

4
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,118
- Cigar?
- No, thank you.

5
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,718
Perhaps wine?

6
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,621
I have one of the finest
collections in all of Colombia.

7
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,026
Okay.

8
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,096
So...

9
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,167
...let's do business.

10
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,404
Jeronimo.

11
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,273
My son.

12
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:23,910
He convinced me
this is the new drug.

13
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,112
Technology.

14
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,316
Faster to grow
and easier to go.

15
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,121
So, this device
can access anything on the net.

16
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:38,825
Targeted power kills,
banking and stock markets...

17
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,763
...blockchains,
encrypted emails,

18
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,299
cyber disruption.

19
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,068
Totally untraceable master key.

20
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,372
Look south.

21
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,806
Here, come.

22
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,745
You're gonna love this.

23
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,049
Okay, three o'clock
from your position.

24
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,918
Okay.

25
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,320
There.

26
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,322
- Cargo plane.
- You see it.

27
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,756
Brazilian Air.

28
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:22,203
Whoa.

29
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,876
Sorry.

30
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,317
And I just blacked out
all of Bogotá.

31
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,530
His little toy can do far more.

32
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,198
This is just a taste.

33
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:55,035
Like we used to... to give
a lick of the coca. Hmm?

34
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,238
And it's the only one, you say?

35
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:01,475
Try and make a copy,
it deletes itself.

36
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,310
I'm the only one
who can make it.

37
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,212
So...

38
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,147
do we have a deal?

39
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,949
Yeah.

40
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,719
Yeah, I think we probably do.

41
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,023
Puta.

42
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,430
Jeronimo.

43
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,767
The drive! Get the drive!

44
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,984
Come.

45
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,155
We got incoming from
the Colombian operative.

46
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,657
He, uh...
he sounds pretty spooked.

47
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,026
Now, he says he's got something
to sell, something that would,

48
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,595
uh, rattle our friends
at the NSA.

49
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:38,165
He's asking for three million,
cash, so he can disappear.

50
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,933
Did he contact
any other agencies?

51
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,403
He doesn't seem
too patient, sir.

52
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,570
That's a yes.

53
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,139
And the Colombians,

54
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,540
- they're coming for him, too.
- Where is he now?

55
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,142
On his way to Paris.

56
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,988
Nice.

57
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,431
Come on.

58
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,669
No close contact, huh?

59
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,473
They get close, I get hurt.

60
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,276
Yeah, you fight like you date.

61
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,245
Oh, you want to talk about
your dating history, big guy?

62
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,946
Another time.

63
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,050
You got a job.

64
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,745
Sight lines here.

65
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,781
Traffic's one-way,
north to south.

66
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,217
Exterior has no clean cover.

67
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,486
Exposure's 360 degrees.
We can't box him in.

68
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,488
No need. He called us.

69
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,122
We trade bags, walk away.

70
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,357
No muss, no fuss.

71
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,758
Why don't we have
a team on this?

72
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,327
It's a simple drop, Mace.

73
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,028
He could've sold that thing
on the black market

74
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,663
for a lot more,
but he just wants three mil

75
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,165
for him and his family
to disappear.

76
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,168
- What a guy.
- You ever consider it?

77
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,770
What? Committing high treason
or starting a family?

78
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,506
Take your pick.

79
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,807
No.

80
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,375
I haven't.

81
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,378
'Cause you love the job.

82
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,379
One of us has to.

83
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,414
Well, if you don't like
the idea of family,

84
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:37,618
you're really gonna love
our cover.

85
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,186
No.

86
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,089
We're, um...

87
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,459
Joel and Ethel Lewis from Iowa.

88
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,428
- On our honeymoon.
- Our honeymoon?

89
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,130
Yeah.

90
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,832
So you crafted this cover?

91
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,602
You wanted me to do more work,
sweetheart.

92
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,738
Try the ring.

93
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,040
See if it fits.

94
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,712
Hmm, it'll do.

95
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,447
Great.

96
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,251
Okay, so, uh, that's
our best access point, huh?

97
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,086
Straight line to the drop.

98
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,588
I'll run lead.

99
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,693
You do know
what honeymooners do, right?

100
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,328
When they're on their honeymoon,

101
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,464
in the most romantic city
in the world, Ethel?

102
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:25,832
You call me Ethel again,

103
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,701
you're gonna wish
you got me a smaller ring.

104
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,170
I want to try something.

105
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,105
No, Nick,
there's no other angles here.

106
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,574
I'm not talking about the job.

107
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,589
What are you doing?

108
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,252
You're my best friend.

109
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,390
I don't have anybody else.

110
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,326
I know.

111
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,498
And I don't want
to mess this up.

112
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,939
Tell me you never
thought about it.

113
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,430
Come here.

114
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,291
It's a little cliché, no?

115
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,326
- What?
- Honeymoon in Paris.

116
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,396
Just 'cause it's cliché
doesn't mean it's not romantic.

117
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,700
Well, that depends
on your definition of romance.

118
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,436
I like the way
that ring looks on you.

119
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,772
That's the spot.

120
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,742
You get us a table.
I'll check out the inside.

121
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,714
Sorry, is this seat taken?

122
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:54,681
No.

123
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,583
Thank you.

124
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,322
Popular area.

125
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,624
Not so bad as the Left Bank.

126
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,028
Hello.

127
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,595
<i>Bonjour.</i>

128
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,831
Uh, two chocolate croissants
and coffee.

129
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,232
<i>Excusez-moi. Et...</i>

130
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:14,735
<i>Merci.</i>

131
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,477
This guy says
stay away from the Left Bank.

132
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,246
Oh, no, we can't skip that.
We're on our honeymoon.

133
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,282
You should have the eggs.

134
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,817
But don't salt them.

135
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:33,887
- <i>Pardon.</i>
- Here it is.

136
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,860
No, I...

137
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:40,894
Where's the bag?

138
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,829
Hey! No, no, no.

139
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,799
Wait!

140
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,603
I'll go after ours!

141
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,492
Where's the drive?! Huh?!

142
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,959
Do you have the drive?

143
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,896
No.

144
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,666
How very disappointing.

145
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:23,803
Luis.

146
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,943
Luis, it's Graciela Rivera.

147
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,612
Open the door.

148
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:38,751
Dr. Rivera.

149
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:40,954
What a surprise.

150
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,622
May I?

151
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,658
Of course.

152
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,035
What are you doing here?

153
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:58,038
This isn't exactly
regular hours.

154
00:18:58,072 --> 00:18:59,639
No, it's not.

155
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,743
You want something to drink?

156
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,979
No, I'm okay, Luis.

157
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:07,680
Are you?

158
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,851
I'm fine.

159
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,024
And where is the package?

160
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:19,093
I don't know
what you're talking about.

161
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,296
They didn't fly me
halfway around the world

162
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,696
for a therapy session.

163
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,766
I never knew
you worked in the field.

164
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,435
No, I never did.

165
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:29,969
Till now.

166
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:35,142
They sent you here because
they thought I would trust you.

167
00:19:36,477 --> 00:19:38,711
Right?

168
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,148
That I would give you
my secrets.

169
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,751
Do you have secrets?

170
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,692
I thought you said
you weren't here for therapy.

171
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,329
I'm not.

172
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,996
I'm here to help you.

173
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:01,101
I'm the only one in the Agency
who really knows you.

174
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,972
Uh, okay.

175
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:59,353
<i>You lost
three million dollars of</i>

176
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,355
- the Agency's money.
- Hey, hey, this isn't an inquisition.

177
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:05,559
We're just making sure we have
all the facts for the report.

178
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:08,128
We lost the package, right?

179
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,830
What did Nick say?
He's been off comms.

180
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,005
Just tell me.

181
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:20,274
Nick didn't make it.

182
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:24,345
He was shot
going after the mark.

183
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:27,014
I I.D.'d his body myself.

184
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:29,882
- I need some water.
- He can get it.

185
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,118
I can get it.

186
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,170
<i>Do you like it?</i>

187
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:52,939
Or is it too much?

188
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:56,909
<i>It's a bit much.</i>

189
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,113
<i>I like it.</i>

190
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,015
I like it, too.

191
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,595
So, it's still out there.

192
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:15,962
We have some leads.

193
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,664
I can find it.

194
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,199
- You're in no shape to...
- I'm fine.

195
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:20,634
- You're the one who lost it.
- Fuck you, Grady.

196
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,069
Dial it down.

197
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:24,304
- This is my...
- I said dial it down.

198
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:28,208
Give us the room.

199
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,150
And turn that thing off.

200
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:38,152
This is my op.
You give it away...

201
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:41,422
The little red light
has to go off.

202
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:53,133
Officially,
I can't put you on this.

203
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:57,237
I said it's not an inquisition,
but there is an investigation.

204
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:00,474
But if you were
to go out on your own,

205
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:05,312
decided you needed to avenge
the death of your teammate...

206
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:09,483
...I could understand
how that might happen.

207
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,252
I would need some help.

208
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,123
<i>It has become undeniable,</i>

209
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:17,458
<i>from the Shadow Brokers</i>

210
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:19,193
and the Vault 7 leaks

211
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:22,229
to new exploits being developed
every day on the dark net,

212
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:25,299
that we need a new solution
in cybersecurity,

213
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:27,401
one that can predict
and intercept

214
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,304
possible cyber threats
passing through any of

215
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:33,207
the 43 access points
that control Internet traffic,

216
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,542
lawfully screen and catalog them

217
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:38,078
to create an adaptive database.

218
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:42,416
Think of it as a Dewey decimal
system for cyberattacks.

219
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,224
I know this may seem
far removed from everyday life,

220
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:53,460
but not when you take
a closer look at reality.

221
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,496
Hey.

222
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:57,231
Dij.

223
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:59,199
I'm guessing
this isn't a social call.

224
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,568
- Ah, and straight to the point.
- So get to it.

225
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:03,504
There's a package...
odds are it's still in Paris,

226
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,539
but I don't know for sure.
We need to retrieve it.

227
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:06,773
"We"?

228
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:07,808
I haven't the faintest idea

229
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,209
what you're talking about.

230
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:11,111
MI6 does,
but this can't be official.

231
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:13,313
- I'm out on my own now.
- Yes, you are.

232
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,115
I'm not in the field anymore.

233
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:17,251
- I'm done with that life.
- Everyone always says that.

234
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:19,119
I say it because it's true.

235
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:20,521
Who's that?

236
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:21,722
I'm sorry you came all this way.

237
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:23,290
Who is that?

238
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:26,059
- My partner.
- Partner in the sense of...

239
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:29,329
- You're my friend from America.
- I am your friend from America.

240
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:31,665
- Hi.
- Hi.

241
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,133
I was talking to some investors.

242
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,768
- They were impressed.
- So was I.

243
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,336
Abdel, this is my friend Mace.

244
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,838
- From America.
- Just passing through.

245
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,239
On her way to Paris.

246
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:40,807
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

247
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,309
I haven't met
many of Khadijah's friends.

248
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:44,177
- No?
- Shame you can't stay.

249
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:47,047
- Well...
- Yes, yes, it is a shame.

250
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:49,383
Until next time.

251
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:51,552
It was good to see you again,
Khadijah.

252
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:53,086
I've missed you.

253
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,388
Safe travels.

254
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:56,623
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

255
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:00,060
Until next time.

256
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:10,571
Hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.

257
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:13,607
Getting into the room
isn't the same as getting in.

258
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:16,310
You didn't ask the question.

259
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:17,878
And you didn't ask
the question because

260
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,746
- you don't want to know the answer.
- Correct.

261
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,114
The package is...

262
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:23,250
- Here we go.
- ...a data key...

263
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:24,718
a set of cyber tools,
exploit kits,

264
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,386
worms, ransomware, you name it...

265
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,189
that can get into any
closed system on the planet.

266
00:26:29,222 --> 00:26:31,191
This suite of tools
is still out there,

267
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:32,726
and I need your help
to track it down.

268
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,696
I haven't heard...

269
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:36,863
I need to take this.

270
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:38,599
They killed Nick.

271
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,848
You know those... the old wars?

272
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:57,751
Cold War, War on Terror.

273
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,219
We knew who we were fighting.

274
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:01,655
But now the enemy's invisible.

275
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,124
Like ghosts in a machine.

276
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,260
If they get their hands on this,

277
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,863
they could control and
destabilize entire city grids,

278
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:13,767
nuclear facilities,
world markets,

279
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,902
anything from a plane in the sky

280
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:18,171
to the phone in your pocket.

281
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:19,506
You know the kind of people

282
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,274
who'll be gunning
to get ahold of this.

283
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,777
And you know
what they'll do with it.

284
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,313
They can control
any part of the world

285
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:27,914
from the simple reach
of their keyboard.

286
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:30,250
Everything you said
on that stage was right.

287
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:32,285
Everything except one thing.

288
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,188
The threat isn't on the horizon.

289
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:37,557
It's here. Right now.

290
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,828
They get this,
they start World War III.

291
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,566
The war would be over before
we could even fight back.

292
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,569
I cannot do this
without you, Dij.

293
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:52,806
You're the best in the world
at what you do.

294
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:02,182
Southwest corner,
around 10:35 a.m.

295
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:06,553
That's her.

296
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,355
Yep, she's the one
who blew the op.

297
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:10,824
Can you find her,
figure out who she is?

298
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,595
Marie Schmidt.

299
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:16,830
Agent with the BND.

300
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,598
- What?
- Demolitions,

301
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:20,434
disobedience, demotions.

302
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,970
Uh, always under suspicion
of being a double agent.

303
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:25,972
Why?

304
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:27,541
Her father.

305
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:30,577
Sold secrets to the Russians
in the early '90s.

306
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,979
Got caught
when she was very young.

307
00:28:33,014 --> 00:28:34,448
Hmm, looks like
it runs in the family.

308
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:36,450
She was working with this guy.

309
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,818
Any known associates
or contacts?

310
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:39,720
One second.

311
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:41,254
Nothing.

312
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:43,290
- What do you mean nothing?
- Nothing.

313
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:46,359
No partner, no husband,

314
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,862
boyfriend, girlfriend,
kids, pets.

315
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,031
Literally nothing.

316
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:52,733
She works alone.

317
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,301
Lives alone.

318
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:56,003
I'm not even finding
a personal email address.

319
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:59,239
Hey, stay on him.

320
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:04,678
How'd he get the drive
in the first place?

321
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:06,480
Hmm, grabbed it
in a cartel raid.

322
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:08,315
Idiot didn't even know
what he had.

323
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:10,550
He tried to sell it
for a lousy three mil.

324
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:15,555
Can you get
another angle in here?

325
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:17,524
It's a blind spot.

326
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:19,060
Can you get
a satellite or something

327
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:21,628
- so we can see in there?
- The definition of "blind"

328
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:22,863
is "can't see."

329
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,435
They knew exactly
where to hit him.

330
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,573
Are you okay?

331
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,643
Yeah.

332
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,882
Stay on him.
He's the one with the drive.

333
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:48,488
He's still in Paris.

334
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:51,092
- He is?
- Registered under Luis Gonzales

335
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,793
at the Hotel Paradis.

336
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:54,095
The program will process

337
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:55,929
his features through
every camera in the city.

338
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:59,432
We can find out where he's been
and track where he's going.

339
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,635
There's a tech conference
in Paris.

340
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:04,538
They had a speaker drop out
at the last second.

341
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:06,073
You sure you don't want company?

342
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:08,408
I'll be back
for dinner tomorrow.

343
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:17,084
You're gonna need these

344
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:19,619
if you're going back
into the field.

345
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:24,925
- I thought this was done.
- So did I.

346
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,831
Dinner.

347
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,033
Tomorrow.

348
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,800
Be safe out there, okay?

349
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:52,946
Luis...

350
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:37,557
There he is. Eleven o'clock,
turning the corner.

351
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:41,561
Will you be
on the plane with me?

352
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:43,630
We go together.

353
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:47,467
I'll take out the guards.
You stay on the bag.

354
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:49,836
They're deploying,
forming a perimeter,

355
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,538
trying to ferret out
surveillance.

356
00:32:51,571 --> 00:32:53,840
- We need a diversion.
- I think we have one.

357
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:13,260
Looks like she's armed.

358
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:14,794
Closing in on the target.

359
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,163
I'll take care of her.
You monitor the bag.

360
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:17,797
Copy that.

361
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,814
Luis.

362
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:57,364
Luis.

363
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:58,798
Luis. Luis.

364
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:30,763
Help!

365
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:33,234
Help!

366
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:36,370
Help! Help!

367
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:38,905
Help!

368
00:35:38,938 --> 00:35:40,040
<i>¡Ayuda!</i>

369
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:42,443
Help! Help!

370
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:50,251
- Mace? Mace?
- Where are you?

371
00:35:50,284 --> 00:35:51,985
Outside, pier three.

372
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:01,928
Gracie.

373
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:22,316
I'm one mike out.

374
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,783
Box him in. Hold steady.

375
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,194
He's made me.

376
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:17,737
- He's heading to the boat.
- I'm on him.

377
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,011
Hey!

378
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:29,596
This is not DGSE headquarters.

379
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,697
It's a safe house.

380
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:33,133
No, I do not feel safe.

381
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:37,104
Do you want to wash off?
I can get you a clean shirt.

382
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:40,574
Drink?

383
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:43,043
No, I... I need to call home.

384
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:45,712
No, wait. We don't know
how deep this goes.

385
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,214
How deep your agency
has been infiltrated.

386
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:49,116
No, I'm not talking about
my agency.

387
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:50,983
I'm talking about my family.

388
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,326
Wrap it up.

389
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,765
Thank you.

390
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,567
What do you know
about the drive?

391
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:46,273
Nothing.

392
00:41:46,306 --> 00:41:48,075
Don't talk to me like
I'm one of your children.

393
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,443
I'm an agent just like you.

394
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:51,778
I'm not an agent.
I'm a psychologist.

395
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:54,615
I was sent here
to analyze one of our agents.

396
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:56,116
What about the men
you were with?

397
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:57,551
Did you analyze them?

398
00:41:57,584 --> 00:42:01,388
I was doing what I was told
to do by my agency.

399
00:42:01,421 --> 00:42:03,190
Do you think I knew

400
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:05,392
they would turn around
and try to shoot me?

401
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:09,196
- Hands!
- You have ten seconds to put your gun down!

402
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:10,797
- Mace.
- You have a new partner.

403
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:13,400
- You got the last one killed.
- What are you talking about?

404
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:14,768
You're working with
the Colombian?

405
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,770
You Americans are so stupid.
Nine.

406
00:42:16,803 --> 00:42:18,438
She was not working with him.

407
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:21,108
- Please put the guns down.
- I would listen to her.

408
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:23,610
- Then by all means do.
- Eight. Seven.

409
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:25,812
- We all want the same thing here.
- No, we don't.

410
00:42:25,846 --> 00:42:27,548
- Six.
- Please.

411
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:28,649
- Five.
- Four.

412
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:30,651
- Three. - Two.
- One!

413
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,690
Go on. Go ahead.

414
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:39,159
Pull the trigger.
Kill each other.

415
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:40,427
Listen, I get it.

416
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,828
You keep botching
each other's ops.

417
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:44,197
I'd be pissed off, too,
but the only way

418
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,633
we are gonna accomplish
anything is if we join forces.

419
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:47,868
Are you crazy?

420
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:50,170
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

421
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:53,407
We have a common enemy.

422
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:57,277
I'm just suggesting
you lower the guns long enough

423
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,346
for us to sort this out
and get on with it.

424
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:00,714
Who are you?

425
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:03,550
Khadijah. MI6.

426
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:10,123
Marie, you've met Mace.

427
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:12,259
- How do you know my name?
- We're spies, asshole.

428
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:14,461
I'm cyber intelligence.

429
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:16,897
Graciela.

430
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,332
That's how you pronounce it,
right?

431
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:20,500
Look, what happened
to you out there,

432
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:21,635
it's terrible.

433
00:43:23,503 --> 00:43:24,738
What do you know
about the drive?

434
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,540
She knows nothing about this.

435
00:43:26,573 --> 00:43:28,342
Well...

436
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,510
that is not entirely true.

437
00:43:30,544 --> 00:43:34,147
- What?
- Luis put a tracker on it.

438
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:35,482
It's linked to his cell phone.

439
00:43:35,515 --> 00:43:37,884
Hey! Slow.

440
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:39,186
- Go ahead.
- How come you didn't tell me

441
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,487
anything about this before?

442
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,922
I didn't know
if I could trust you.

443
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,826
- And now you do?
- No, but I had no choice,

444
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:47,561
and I can't do this myself.

445
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:50,297
- It's encrypted.
- No, no, it works.

446
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:56,937
He installed a fail-safe
to your fingerprint.

447
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,538
I can't breach that.

448
00:43:58,572 --> 00:43:59,773
The drive's on the move.

449
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:02,876
Headed southeast
over the Atlantic.

450
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:04,778
- Middle East?
- Due south.

451
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,880
Africa. Let me check.

452
00:44:06,913 --> 00:44:08,482
Flight plans.

453
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:09,816
Morocco.

454
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,252
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, no.

455
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:14,588
I'm not going with you.
I'm going home.

456
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:15,922
But we can't do this
without your fingerprints.

457
00:44:15,956 --> 00:44:17,658
That is not my problem.

458
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:19,960
Oh, it is if you want to keep
them attached to your body.

459
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,828
I'm sorry. I have a family.

460
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:23,664
I'm not an agent.
I'm a therapist.

461
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:26,566
- And this is really not for me.
- All right, Graciela.

462
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,435
You know what else
may not be for you?

463
00:44:28,468 --> 00:44:31,405
Is explaining to your kids
why the whole world is on fire

464
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:33,407
because the bad guys got ahold
of the device before we did.

465
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,910
We're the only ones who can
prevent that from happening.

466
00:44:36,943 --> 00:44:38,712
- Sorry.
- Okay, how 'bout this?

467
00:44:38,745 --> 00:44:41,915
Those same guys are out there
right now looking for you.

468
00:44:41,948 --> 00:44:45,318
You go home,
you bring them with you.

469
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:46,820
Graciela,
we really need your help.

470
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:50,624
But more importantly,
you need ours.

471
00:44:56,863 --> 00:45:00,467
Okay. I'm gonna need to make
another phone call.

472
00:45:01,435 --> 00:45:03,637
And I'm gonna need a new shirt.

473
00:45:04,638 --> 00:45:05,806
Burners.

474
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:07,874
From now on.

475
00:45:07,908 --> 00:45:10,744
No, I won't be home for dinner.

476
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:13,580
Just a little longer, babes.

477
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:16,650
No one to call?

478
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:19,586
You got him killed when
you blew the op at the café.

479
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,024
Yeah.
That's the thing with partners.

480
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:24,591
They get killed.

481
00:45:27,627 --> 00:45:29,463
Or they kill you.

482
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:32,566
Is that some kind of threat?

483
00:45:34,434 --> 00:45:35,635
Yes.

484
00:45:36,636 --> 00:45:38,638
Yes, it is.

485
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,676
Yes, I'm safe.

486
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:43,977
Look, I have to go.

487
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:46,446
Talk to you later. Bye.

488
00:45:48,348 --> 00:45:50,283
You lie to protect him?

489
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:55,455
You have children?

490
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:57,524
No.

491
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:00,794
It gets harder to lie.

492
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,576
I've got satellite and
surveillance on every angle.

493
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,279
Positive on the drive.

494
00:46:22,716 --> 00:46:24,785
He's clean.

495
00:46:24,818 --> 00:46:26,653
I'm not picking up any tails.

496
00:46:26,686 --> 00:46:27,821
I'm on him.

497
00:46:28,522 --> 00:46:30,057
We know he's armed.

498
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:32,359
He doesn't care about
disturbing the crowd.

499
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:34,594
I really shouldn't be here
for this part.

500
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:37,697
You just handle the phone.
I'll handle the guns.

501
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,103
<i>Ay.</i>

502
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:43,837
- I'm scared.
- Good.

503
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,672
Only an idiot isn't scared.

504
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:55,515
Package is heading north
into the square.

505
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,052
You have him
boxed in from both sides.

506
00:46:58,085 --> 00:46:59,753
You have direct angles to him.

507
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:02,823
You've got a window.
Good to move in.

508
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:07,661
He's reaching for something.

509
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:08,728
Dij?

510
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:16,103
Was that a brush-past?
Dij, you get that?

511
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:17,737
One sec. Let me look.

512
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:20,107
Our targets are heading
in opposite directions.

513
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:21,808
I'm not
going to risk losing him.

514
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:24,078
- We need to split up.
- Fine. You take the courier.

515
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:25,979
Let's go.

516
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:28,115
I have eyes on the new player.

517
00:47:28,149 --> 00:47:30,617
I'll stay on him.
Dij, how you doing?

518
00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:33,120
Still confirming the handoff.

519
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:35,122
All my angles are blocked.

520
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:49,903
Gracie.

521
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,079
It's a kill box.

522
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:05,418
Affirmative.

523
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:06,820
He made a handoff.

524
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:11,925
Mace, your man has the drive.

525
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:19,499
Four killers on the move.

526
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:30,777
They're going after the drive.
We've got competition.

527
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,512
Take this.

528
00:48:32,545 --> 00:48:34,048
- Take it.
- You said I didn't have to do the gun stuff.

529
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:36,850
It changed. The plan changed.
Take it.

530
00:48:45,692 --> 00:48:48,461
Dij, get me a visual
on the building.

531
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:51,865
It's a hammam.

532
00:48:51,898 --> 00:48:54,101
Perfect. I'll take him
in there, away from the crowd.

533
00:48:54,968 --> 00:48:57,971
How's a white woman
gonna get in there unnoticed?

534
00:48:58,005 --> 00:48:59,806
It's a men-only hammam.

535
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,875
I'm on my way.

536
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,083
Hey. You're not
going in there alone.

537
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,850
And you're not
going there at all.

538
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:14,754
The last time
you went into an op alone...

539
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:16,723
Was the last time
I was in the field.

540
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:17,557
Yes, I know.

541
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,693
There's no other play here,
Mace.

542
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:21,995
How do I look?

543
00:49:26,866 --> 00:49:29,036
Hasn't been
my experience with him.

544
00:49:39,879 --> 00:49:41,514
He's heading east.

545
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:03,636
Get out of there.
There's three more coming in.

546
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:08,009
Dij?

547
00:50:31,631 --> 00:50:33,167
He must have made us
in the market.

548
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,635
Using this place as
a cut-through to shake us off.

549
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:37,304
You guys have
eyes on the package?

550
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:38,838
Affirmative.

551
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:40,907
But we're not
the only ones who do.

552
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,652
One down. That leaves three.

553
00:50:52,685 --> 00:50:54,255
We need to stop them
before they get to him.

554
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:55,822
We've got to find them
in this crowd.

555
00:50:55,855 --> 00:50:57,091
One second.

556
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:02,796
Hello?

557
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:10,637
Those two,
not answering their phones.

558
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,739
They must be
on a closed network.

559
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:14,741
We've got two headed east
towards the main square.

560
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:17,111
Package is headed
in the same direction.

561
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,582
Another down.

562
00:51:25,852 --> 00:51:27,088
I have one on the rooftop.

563
00:51:27,121 --> 00:51:28,822
Taking high position to hit him.

564
00:51:28,855 --> 00:51:29,923
Mace.

565
00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:38,598
Just one left.

566
00:51:53,913 --> 00:51:56,317
- It's too exposed.
- Maybe we could...

567
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,818
We don't know if there
are any more men out there.

568
00:51:58,852 --> 00:52:00,387
- We could go into one of those...
- We need clear angles.

569
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:01,788
Checking the exits.

570
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:02,922
Hello.
I'm trying to say something.

571
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:04,891
- Not now, Gracie.
- Yes, now!

572
00:52:05,758 --> 00:52:07,994
Why do you have to be exposed?

573
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:11,764
You don't.

574
00:52:47,201 --> 00:52:49,236
This system is...

575
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:55,309
These algorithms are
beyond anything I've ever seen.

576
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:58,012
Next generation
zero-day data set.

577
00:52:58,045 --> 00:53:01,182
Parallel infinity-bit
encryption systems.

578
00:53:01,215 --> 00:53:02,815
- I mean...
- So this is...?

579
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,053
- Poetic.
- I'll call it in.

580
00:53:06,986 --> 00:53:08,788
Why would your agency
get the drive?

581
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:10,723
What does it matter?
We hand it over, we're done.

582
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:12,193
Look, we have a station
in Rabat.

583
00:53:12,226 --> 00:53:13,294
I can get a guy here in an hour.

584
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:14,461
Where is your closest man?

585
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:16,197
Come on, trust me.

586
00:53:18,132 --> 00:53:20,733
- I knew you'd get it done.
- I had a little help.

587
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,336
Joint-force effort.

588
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,937
I'll contact your agencies.

589
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,939
You'll have commendations
waiting for you back home.

590
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:31,478
And the investigation into me?

591
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:33,314
It's officially closed.

592
00:53:33,347 --> 00:53:36,050
Wheels up in two hours.

593
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:42,356
It was your first time,
you stayed alive,

594
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:44,425
and that's the achievement. Cheers.

595
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:50,030
I remember my first time.

596
00:53:50,064 --> 00:53:52,233
Barely a year out of the Army.

597
00:53:52,266 --> 00:53:53,833
Stationed in Pakistan.

598
00:53:53,866 --> 00:53:55,302
I was on a surveillance
detection run in Pindi.

599
00:53:55,336 --> 00:53:58,138
I realized I had someone on me.

600
00:53:58,172 --> 00:53:59,973
God, I was so nervous.

601
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:01,508
You know how those roads are:
total darkness,

602
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:03,110
stuff coming out of nowhere.

603
00:54:03,143 --> 00:54:05,845
All of a sudden...

604
00:54:05,878 --> 00:54:08,848
I run 35 miles an hour
straight into a cow.

605
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:10,883
Nearly killed me.

606
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:12,019
What about the cow?

607
00:54:12,052 --> 00:54:14,321
My first official agency kill.

608
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:18,891
What was your first time?

609
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:20,094
You don't want to hear about it.

610
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:21,995
You definitely want
to hear about it.

611
00:54:24,198 --> 00:54:25,532
Tell us.

612
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:27,301
Okay.

613
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:29,969
I was tracing intel on a phone,

614
00:54:30,004 --> 00:54:33,274
and I geolocated it to a
detention site in Afghanistan,

615
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:35,009
which didn't make any sense

616
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:38,845
because they don't exactly
allow phones in there, so...

617
00:54:38,878 --> 00:54:41,148
But there was this one gentleman

618
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:46,053
who had hidden it
in a secure location.

619
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,359
- In his...?
- Up his bum.

620
00:54:52,393 --> 00:54:53,527
No way.

621
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,496
All the way up there.

622
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:58,098
I'll never forget it.
Nokia 8850.

623
00:54:58,132 --> 00:54:59,166
Long and slim.

624
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:00,100
You cannot imagine

625
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:02,336
the stench that emanated
from that chipset.

626
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:05,838
I've been attached to
my hand sanitizer ever since.

627
00:55:05,872 --> 00:55:07,308
Okay, I'm done eating.

628
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:10,144
Hey, what about you?
When was your first?

629
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:15,249
Come on, now.
We showed you ours.

630
00:55:15,282 --> 00:55:18,818
Name, age, nationality.

631
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:22,822
Walter.

632
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,859
He was German,
and, um, I was 15.

633
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,029
You were 15?

634
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:32,899
I came down the stairs
from my room,

635
00:55:32,932 --> 00:55:36,470
and I heard my father
speak Russian.

636
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:39,206
I never knew
he could speak Russian.

637
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:43,110
I didn't know those men were
KGB, but I knew they were bad.

638
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:49,049
He was washing blood
off his hands, and, um...

639
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:51,018
there was a body on the floor.

640
00:55:53,986 --> 00:55:56,123
So you turned in
your own father?

641
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:57,324
Yep.

642
00:55:59,992 --> 00:56:01,628
Are you in therapy?

643
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:03,230
Hmm.

644
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:04,365
I should be.

645
00:56:04,398 --> 00:56:06,100
Yeah.

646
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:07,900
I think, I think you should.

647
00:56:07,934 --> 00:56:10,070
I know this is no consolation,

648
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:12,506
but I just have to say
that you are,

649
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:14,874
without a doubt...

650
00:56:15,576 --> 00:56:17,111
...the most...

651
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:20,481
...screwed-up of us all.

652
00:56:21,948 --> 00:56:23,517
Yes.

653
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,219
True.

654
00:56:25,252 --> 00:56:27,020
Cheers to that.

655
00:56:28,021 --> 00:56:29,656
Oh, no. We need another round.

656
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,458
Or like ten. All for you.

657
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:32,959
Thanks.

658
00:56:32,992 --> 00:56:34,428
...to secure their airspaces,

659
00:56:34,461 --> 00:56:36,463
as reports are coming in of a...

660
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,125
I'm not here for you.

661
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,463
Can you turn that up?

662
00:57:09,496 --> 00:57:11,365
Air towers have

663
00:57:11,398 --> 00:57:15,102
multiple fail-safes,
backup power sources,

664
00:57:15,135 --> 00:57:17,638
so the FAA is investigating
what went wrong.

665
00:57:17,671 --> 00:57:19,206
Even with the power outage

666
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,575
- to the whole of the city of Lisbon...
- Dij.

667
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,710
...there should have
been redundancies to prevent

668
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:25,112
this kind of malfunction.

669
00:57:25,145 --> 00:57:26,547
All planes experienced
the outage

670
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,581
that caused them to crash.

671
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:29,049
Phone.

672
00:57:29,082 --> 00:57:30,617
Officials have
yet to make a statement,

673
00:57:30,651 --> 00:57:33,986
but many believe this may have
been a terrorist attack.

674
00:57:34,021 --> 00:57:36,323
So, six passenger planes so far

675
00:57:36,356 --> 00:57:40,093
and two more still missing
we've yet to locate.

676
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:41,328
There should have been

677
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:43,197
fail-safes,
backup power sources...

678
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,199
Tracker's been turned off.

679
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:46,333
Shit.

680
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:47,601
Answer.

681
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:49,236
Answer the phone, Marks.

682
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:57,044
He's here.

683
00:58:02,483 --> 00:58:04,017
Sh...

684
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:05,686
Strip the place. Search it!

685
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:08,121
Gracie. Lock the door!

686
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:22,269
The drive's gone.

687
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,348
We have something.

688
00:58:34,381 --> 00:58:35,782
What?

689
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:37,551
Company.

690
00:58:38,785 --> 00:58:40,387
They're already here.

691
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:43,724
Gracie, get back.

692
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:50,097
Mace?

693
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,331
We didn't do this.
We found him dead.

694
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:54,134
Put your guns down
or we will fire.

695
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:56,270
You're making a big mistake.

696
00:58:56,303 --> 00:58:58,138
The only mistake
that we ever made

697
00:58:58,171 --> 00:58:59,806
was not putting you in a cage
when we had the chance.

698
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,174
Listen to me, Grady.
Don't be an idiot.

699
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,376
- This doesn't track!
- No?

700
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:03,410
No!

701
00:59:03,443 --> 00:59:04,511
Marks was here
investigating you,

702
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:05,779
and now he's dead.

703
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:07,247
And you happen to be
standing with

704
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:08,682
the very people
who killed your teammate.

705
00:59:08,715 --> 00:59:10,584
Well, I'd say it's tracking
pretty well for me.

706
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:11,818
Fine. What's my motive?

707
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,353
I don't know.
I don't care. Money.

708
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:15,856
- Come on!
- Power? I don't care.

709
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:18,026
Put your guns down!

710
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:21,094
I've got four more agents
out on the street.

711
00:59:21,128 --> 00:59:22,362
I counted six.

712
00:59:23,163 --> 00:59:24,464
But thanks for the tip.

713
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:42,849
You have no idea how
much goddamn trouble you're in.

714
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:45,319
Oh, yeah, I do.

715
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:53,393
Come on, Gracie.

716
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:54,461
Let's go.

717
00:59:54,494 --> 00:59:56,263
I'm sorry.

718
00:59:56,296 --> 00:59:58,265
I cannot do this anymore.

719
00:59:58,298 --> 01:00:01,335
I have two children,
and I'm going home.

720
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:04,237
You're never gonna see your
family again if you don't move.

721
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:06,473
I am a normal person.

722
01:00:06,506 --> 01:00:07,507
I can't do this.

723
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:10,143
- I'm... I'm not made for this. I told you.
- Hey!

724
01:00:10,177 --> 01:00:11,612
Listen to me, Gracie.

725
01:00:11,645 --> 01:00:13,146
There are six officers
coming up the stairs right now.

726
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,481
When they blow through
that door,

727
01:00:14,514 --> 01:00:15,749
you do not want to be
on the other side of it.

728
01:00:31,264 --> 01:00:32,699
Three more on me! Come on!

729
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:34,534
Check the bodies!

730
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:37,771
They're alive.

731
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:40,540
They're not in here.

732
01:00:40,574 --> 01:00:42,309
Place is clear.

733
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:00,587
Hey.

734
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,322
We're ready to go.

735
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:05,258
Marie, we got to move.

736
01:02:05,892 --> 01:02:07,728
Ready.

737
01:02:09,796 --> 01:02:11,465
So you got ahold of your boss.

738
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:13,533
- He did what they all do.
- Hey.

739
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:15,769
Are you under control?

740
01:02:17,038 --> 01:02:18,538
Are you?

741
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:22,375
No.

742
01:02:24,978 --> 01:02:26,480
Let's go.

743
01:02:29,382 --> 01:02:30,851
So now what?

744
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:33,787
We have no information.

745
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,689
How do we go forward?

746
01:02:37,058 --> 01:02:38,492
We don't go forward.

747
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:40,560
We go back.

748
01:02:53,573 --> 01:02:54,741
Sit down.

749
01:03:01,115 --> 01:03:03,450
He declines to answer.

750
01:03:03,483 --> 01:03:05,519
That is not what I said.

751
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:07,088
Oh, you speak English.
Great. Enough of that.

752
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:08,655
Yassine, the fact
that you're not dead

753
01:03:08,688 --> 01:03:10,091
means that
somebody's protecting you.

754
01:03:10,124 --> 01:03:11,892
There are two ways
we can go about this

755
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:14,427
but only one outcome.

756
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:15,896
We're going to get what we want.

757
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:19,666
We can do it the easy way
or we can do it the hard way.

758
01:03:19,699 --> 01:03:21,068
You decide.

759
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:22,435
We know you don't care
about the cause.

760
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:23,937
You just care about the cash.

761
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,373
And you damn well know that
your friends don't give a shit

762
01:03:26,406 --> 01:03:27,574
about you now that
you've been caught.

763
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:29,543
So it's just us,
right here, right now.

764
01:03:29,576 --> 01:03:31,444
We are the only ones
who can help you.

765
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,480
Allah will protect me.

766
01:03:33,513 --> 01:03:35,116
What is it
that Allah says about

767
01:03:35,149 --> 01:03:36,583
killing a believer?

768
01:03:36,616 --> 01:03:38,085
"Whoever kills a believer
intentionally,

769
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:39,686
his recompense is hell,
where..."

770
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:41,788
"...he will abide eternally."

771
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:44,658
That package you were
delivering is very dangerous.

772
01:03:44,691 --> 01:03:47,561
Many people will die
if you don't help us find it.

773
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:50,430
Believers. Innocent people.

774
01:03:50,463 --> 01:03:51,865
What do you know about it?

775
01:03:51,898 --> 01:03:54,401
I cannot tell you that.

776
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:57,437
Okay, story time's over.

777
01:04:04,644 --> 01:04:06,580
That's your femoral artery.

778
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:08,748
- You're going to bleed to death in about two minutes.
- No.

779
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:13,620
If we put that tourniquet
on it, you'll live.

780
01:04:13,653 --> 01:04:15,722
But if we don't, you'll die.

781
01:04:17,924 --> 01:04:19,160
Please.

782
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,162
- Save me please.
- I won't be a part of this.

783
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,963
- Please.
- Starting to feel dizzy?

784
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:24,098
Save yourself.

785
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:25,866
If you kill me,
you have nothing.

786
01:04:25,899 --> 01:04:27,434
That's true.

787
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:30,104
But if you live,
we also have nothing,

788
01:04:30,137 --> 01:04:32,106
so based on those two options...

789
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:34,141
Do you mean to die for this?

790
01:04:35,508 --> 01:04:36,776
That light you're seeing...

791
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,512
you're about
to lose consciousness.

792
01:04:40,147 --> 01:04:42,949
Okay! Okay, I'll tell you!

793
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:47,021
There is an auction in two days.

794
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:48,555
Why would there be an auction

795
01:04:48,588 --> 01:04:50,057
- if they already have it?
- The-the planes,

796
01:04:50,091 --> 01:04:51,958
the blackout, that was, um...

797
01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:53,960
Advertisement.

798
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:57,597
Yes, yes. To-to... to show
people what-what it can do.

799
01:04:58,632 --> 01:05:00,901
- Now everybody wants it.
- Where's the auction?

800
01:05:00,934 --> 01:05:02,002
Shanghai.

801
01:05:03,037 --> 01:05:04,671
Li Na Auction House.

802
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:07,908
Please stop me bleeding.
Please, please.

803
01:05:14,614 --> 01:05:16,549
You should've picked
the easy way.

804
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,220
<i>We had a team of men there</i>

805
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:20,854
<i>to guarantee delivery.</i>

806
01:05:20,887 --> 01:05:22,689
Are you telling me
that you've lost the package

807
01:05:22,722 --> 01:05:25,026
to a harem of women
in headscarves?

808
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:28,828
I have shorted the markets
from Nikkei to Wall Street.

809
01:05:28,862 --> 01:05:31,065
I want those women dead.

810
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,866
And I want that drive
in my hand.

811
01:05:32,899 --> 01:05:35,169
Otherwise, the next delivery
will be a bullet to your head.

812
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:36,836
Do you understand?

813
01:05:47,914 --> 01:05:50,251
Can't sleep?

814
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:51,851
Occupational hazard.

815
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:57,524
Like a family vacation.

816
01:05:58,525 --> 01:06:00,527
I wouldn't know.

817
01:06:01,861 --> 01:06:03,797
Me neither.

818
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:09,669
Get some rest. You'll need it.

819
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:45,739
What'd you tell him?

820
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:47,607
That I'd be a bit longer.

821
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,609
And what'd he say?

822
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:52,746
He hasn't been sleeping well.

823
01:06:53,813 --> 01:06:55,016
Without me.

824
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:58,219
That's real love, huh?

825
01:06:58,252 --> 01:07:00,321
That's real life, Mace.

826
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:02,756
James Bond never
has to deal with real life.

827
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:06,060
James Bond always ends up alone.

828
01:07:10,064 --> 01:07:12,665
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

829
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:15,169
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

830
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:16,903
Okay, here's the plan.

831
01:07:16,936 --> 01:07:19,606
They're setting up
for the auction.

832
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:21,208
There'll be security
on all sides.

833
01:07:21,242 --> 01:07:24,577
The best way in
is through the front.

834
01:07:25,279 --> 01:07:27,048
In there is a closed system.

835
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:30,683
I've tried to get in remotely,
but I need physical access.

836
01:07:32,086 --> 01:07:33,753
<i>Once we're all inside,</i>

837
01:07:33,787 --> 01:07:36,756
<i>I can get into the cameras,
power, security systems</i>

838
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:37,924
<i>and steer you
the rest of the way through.</i>

839
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:40,727
You'll have cameras
in your jewelry,

840
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,795
comms in your earrings.

841
01:07:41,828 --> 01:07:43,097
We'll be connected at all times.

842
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,768
<i>How do we
get past the front door?</i>

843
01:07:48,802 --> 01:07:50,570
<i>I can get us on the list.</i>

844
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:53,973
- Thank you.
- It's Anderson. Yeah.

845
01:07:54,008 --> 01:07:55,176
...Z-L-R...

846
01:07:57,044 --> 01:07:59,213
<i>Now, the event
is a legitimate auction</i>

847
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,648
<i>for ancient art and artifacts.</i>

848
01:08:01,681 --> 01:08:04,884
But it's just a cover
for the real proximity auction

849
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:08,122
taking place on the dark net
on their phones.

850
01:08:08,155 --> 01:08:09,889
Silent, invite-only.

851
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:12,193
That's where the real bidding
for the drive

852
01:08:12,226 --> 01:08:13,827
will be taking place.

853
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:16,796
That drive will be hidden
in one of the items for sale.

854
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,798
- Which one?
- I don't know yet.

855
01:08:18,832 --> 01:08:22,869
So, we'll have to rely
on your... social skills.

856
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:25,672
<i>I'll need you
to make new friends</i>

857
01:08:25,705 --> 01:08:27,707
<i>to I.D. the item.</i>

858
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:30,743
This list is like half
the CIA's most wanted.

859
01:08:34,981 --> 01:08:37,650
<i>When it goes up for auction,</i>

860
01:08:37,684 --> 01:08:40,321
<i>I'll create a diversion,
you grab it and go.</i>

861
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,130
Help me. I can't...

862
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:51,031
Why isn't it opening?

863
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:05,845
Okay, I'm in position.

864
01:09:08,449 --> 01:09:11,152
Gray hair,
between the two statues.

865
01:09:11,185 --> 01:09:12,453
He's emitting two signals,

866
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:14,954
and he's focusing too much
on that program.

867
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:19,293
I'll spill my drink on him.

868
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:21,761
- Where'd you learn that move?
- Paris.

869
01:09:21,794 --> 01:09:23,863
Enemy agent.
Ruined my favorite dress.

870
01:09:23,897 --> 01:09:25,332
If that was your favorite dress,

871
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:27,368
she really did you a favor.

872
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:28,935
Oh, no!

873
01:09:28,968 --> 01:09:32,006
- I'm okay.
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

874
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:32,872
It's all right.

875
01:09:36,377 --> 01:09:39,079
God, this is so uncomfortable.

876
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:41,115
It itches so much.

877
01:09:42,782 --> 01:09:46,986
A woman such as yourself
should never be alone.

878
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,927
Gracie, say "thank you." Flirt.

879
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,429
Thank you.

880
01:09:55,462 --> 01:09:58,165
I'm no good at flirting.

881
01:09:58,199 --> 01:09:59,999
Luckily, I am.

882
01:10:00,034 --> 01:10:02,203
Okay, your friend's
name is Pyotr Khasanov.

883
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:03,204
Chechen billionaire.

884
01:10:03,237 --> 01:10:04,938
Just act interested.

885
01:10:04,971 --> 01:10:07,141
Don't think of it as seduction.
Think of it as deduction.

886
01:10:07,174 --> 01:10:09,009
He's just a patient
with a problem.

887
01:10:09,043 --> 01:10:10,710
Find it.

888
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:16,749
What brings you here?
Are you a collector of art?

889
01:10:17,418 --> 01:10:20,354
I'm a collector of...
many things.

890
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,489
Ooh.

891
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,468
Here you go.

892
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:37,137
It really is a very nice suit.

893
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,308
- Thank you.
- Good as new.

894
01:10:41,342 --> 01:10:42,476
Thank you.

895
01:10:42,509 --> 01:10:43,876
I'm scouting out front.

896
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:47,114
I'm just checking something out.

897
01:10:49,882 --> 01:10:51,818
He didn't get past
the third page.

898
01:10:51,851 --> 01:10:53,987
Okay, there's five items
on that page, Gracie.

899
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:56,889
Painting, mirror, dagger,
dragon's head, vase.

900
01:10:57,524 --> 01:10:58,992
What is it you like?

901
01:10:59,026 --> 01:11:01,928
Painting seems too boring...
no surprises.

902
01:11:01,961 --> 01:11:03,796
I do like to be surprised.

903
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,832
Ancient weapons?

904
01:11:07,234 --> 01:11:09,403
No. You seem like
a man of the future.

905
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:13,407
And I have a feeling you have
enough weapons already.

906
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,076
What did you say your name was?

907
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,218
I thought you liked surprises.

908
01:11:25,985 --> 01:11:28,055
Which means an antique mirror

909
01:11:28,088 --> 01:11:30,557
wouldn't be right for you
either since you already know

910
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:32,159
what you're gonna see in it.

911
01:11:32,192 --> 01:11:34,395
His eyes are dilating.
He's more interested in you.

912
01:11:34,428 --> 01:11:35,429
It's not the mirror.

913
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:36,963
I like this game.

914
01:11:36,996 --> 01:11:40,301
Mm, yes.
You do like games, don't you?

915
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:42,869
Well, the game is not over.

916
01:11:42,902 --> 01:11:45,339
I still don't know
what you're here for.

917
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:50,444
A dragon's head.

918
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:52,812
A symbol of power.

919
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,115
Perhaps.

920
01:11:57,484 --> 01:11:59,019
Hmm.

921
01:12:00,354 --> 01:12:01,921
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

922
01:12:01,954 --> 01:12:04,891
Wait. Where are you going?
The game's not over.

923
01:12:04,924 --> 01:12:06,826
It's in the vase.

924
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:12,066
Mace, everyone's in position.

925
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:13,100
The auction's about to begin.

926
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:15,436
Rolling back to you.

927
01:12:16,437 --> 01:12:17,837
Hi.

928
01:12:18,605 --> 01:12:19,640
You're alive.

929
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:21,075
Bloody hell.

930
01:12:21,108 --> 01:12:23,277
It's good to see you, Mace.

931
01:12:24,244 --> 01:12:25,845
Come here.

932
01:12:30,584 --> 01:12:32,386
Oh, my God.

933
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,322
I don't understand.

934
01:12:36,256 --> 01:12:37,890
Hey, Khadij.

935
01:12:38,425 --> 01:12:40,860
I'd like to see her alone now.

936
01:12:42,062 --> 01:12:44,398
Hey, what-what is this?
What is your op?

937
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:46,600
- Mace...
- Why didn't the Agency tell me what was going on?

938
01:12:46,633 --> 01:12:48,569
There's no op. Things changed.

939
01:12:55,942 --> 01:12:57,244
Welcome.

940
01:12:59,513 --> 01:13:01,648
Thank you all for attending.

941
01:13:01,682 --> 01:13:03,983
I will be hosting
tonight's auction.

942
01:13:04,017 --> 01:13:05,252
I'm not getting anything
on the host.

943
01:13:05,285 --> 01:13:07,521
Please take your seats.

944
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:09,889
We are about to begin.

945
01:13:14,027 --> 01:13:15,928
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

946
01:13:15,962 --> 01:13:17,364
We begin tonight's auction

947
01:13:17,398 --> 01:13:19,932
with this Chinese painting
from the third century.

948
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:22,202
We will begin our auction
at 8,000.

949
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:24,505
- We're in position.
- Do I have 8,000?

950
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:26,607
- 8,000...
- Where's Mace?

951
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,208
Following a lead.

952
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:37,984
Uh...

953
01:13:38,018 --> 01:13:39,952
I've lost access to the network.

954
01:13:42,022 --> 01:13:44,024
I'm compromised.
Someone's hacking me back.

955
01:13:44,057 --> 01:13:45,659
I need to reposition,
baseline my gear.

956
01:13:45,692 --> 01:13:47,428
Give me 15 seconds. Do not move.

957
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:49,229
17,000, 18.

958
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:54,334
Any more? 19. Do I have 20?

959
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:56,103
As soon as they wheel
that thing out,

960
01:13:56,136 --> 01:13:57,438
we need to make a move.

961
01:13:57,471 --> 01:13:58,639
No. She said to stay here.

962
01:13:58,672 --> 01:14:00,240
She can't kill the lights.

963
01:14:08,015 --> 01:14:09,383
You're working with murderers?

964
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:11,018
And you're not?

965
01:14:11,051 --> 01:14:13,120
How many people
have the CIA assassinated?

966
01:14:13,153 --> 01:14:14,588
How many states
have they toppled?

967
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:16,190
How many wars have they started?

968
01:14:16,223 --> 01:14:18,058
You're on your own now, right?

969
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:20,960
Off the grid? On the run?

970
01:14:22,362 --> 01:14:23,996
How does it feel?

971
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:26,500
Tell me.

972
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:32,439
How does it feel to be free?

973
01:14:33,373 --> 01:14:35,742
The next item
is a 13th century vase

974
01:14:35,776 --> 01:14:38,512
from the Chinese Yuan dynasty.

975
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:41,348
I'm not losing that drive again.

976
01:14:41,381 --> 01:14:43,050
We will start the bidding

977
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:46,353
at 100,000 U.S. dollars.

978
01:14:47,254 --> 01:14:49,790
100,000. 110, 20. 130,000.

979
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:51,758
130, 140. Thank you.

980
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:53,160
Any more bids from the phones?

981
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:54,628
Khadijah, are we back in?

982
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:58,065
I'm into the cameras,
but I can't get in the lights.

983
01:14:58,098 --> 01:15:00,434
Looks like the real bidding's
started, though.

984
01:15:00,467 --> 01:15:02,402
The hardest thing
about all this, Mace,

985
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:05,005
was thinking
I'd never see you again.

986
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:07,741
Wow.

987
01:15:07,774 --> 01:15:09,776
This is an angle.

988
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:11,545
I can't believe
you're trying to work me.

989
01:15:11,578 --> 01:15:13,413
If I didn't want you to see me,
you wouldn't have seen me.

990
01:15:13,447 --> 01:15:15,249
Oh, you didn't want me
to see you in Paris, did you?

991
01:15:15,282 --> 01:15:16,517
You wanted me to think
that you were dead.

992
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,486
Yeah, so you were clean.
I did that for you.

993
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,455
For me? Uh-huh.

994
01:15:21,488 --> 01:15:24,124
Without any regard
to how it would make me feel.

995
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:27,127
How did it make you feel?

996
01:15:31,398 --> 01:15:33,166
Bitter.

997
01:15:36,803 --> 01:15:39,239
You're still wearing this ring.

998
01:15:40,407 --> 01:15:42,409
The bidding's
over a hundred mil.

999
01:15:44,778 --> 01:15:47,047
What's it gonna be, Mace?

1000
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:50,651
Come with me.

1001
01:15:57,257 --> 01:15:59,393
I need this back.

1002
01:16:04,197 --> 01:16:06,400
Always such a tough guy.

1003
01:16:08,268 --> 01:16:11,605
Okay. Keep her here
out of the way.

1004
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:39,733
- 300,000.
- We have 300,000.

1005
01:16:39,766 --> 01:16:41,868
- Any more from the phones?
- 350,000.

1006
01:16:41,902 --> 01:16:43,470
Thank you, sir.

1007
01:16:43,503 --> 01:16:45,205
Any more on 350?

1008
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:46,607
- Anyone willing to give me more?
- Who's that?

1009
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,542
- Do I have any higher bids?
- A ghost.

1010
01:16:48,575 --> 01:16:50,644
Fair warning with you, sir.

1011
01:16:50,677 --> 01:16:52,145
500,000.

1012
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:54,181
Half a million.

1013
01:16:54,214 --> 01:16:55,515
Currently at $500,000,

1014
01:16:55,549 --> 01:16:57,417
- ladies and gentlemen.
- We're gonna lose it.

1015
01:16:57,451 --> 01:16:58,752
We have to move.

1016
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:00,754
If the drive is in that vase,

1017
01:17:00,787 --> 01:17:02,856
I can tag
the electronic signature.

1018
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:04,625
But you'll have to get closer.

1019
01:17:04,658 --> 01:17:06,760
We can tag it, tail it,
and then we can make a move

1020
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:08,228
as soon as it's clear.

1021
01:17:08,261 --> 01:17:09,529
- Do I have...
- A million.

1022
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:12,532
One million.

1023
01:17:13,533 --> 01:17:15,669
One million U.S. dollars
with the gentleman.

1024
01:17:15,702 --> 01:17:17,771
He's just bid

1025
01:17:17,804 --> 01:17:19,373
$300 million online.

1026
01:17:19,406 --> 01:17:22,242
I have a way to get closer.

1027
01:17:22,275 --> 01:17:25,278
Any further bids on the phones?

1028
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:27,314
It is now or never.

1029
01:17:27,347 --> 01:17:28,515
Did you get what you wanted?

1030
01:17:28,548 --> 01:17:29,783
This is the last bid.

1031
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:32,219
Now I did.

1032
01:17:33,387 --> 01:17:34,921
One million and one, anyone?

1033
01:17:34,955 --> 01:17:36,923
He's at half a billion dollars.

1034
01:17:36,957 --> 01:17:38,725
The gavel is up.

1035
01:17:38,759 --> 01:17:40,293
She's too exposed.

1036
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:42,663
You're not close enough, Gracie.

1037
01:17:42,696 --> 01:17:43,864
Going once.

1038
01:17:43,897 --> 01:17:45,632
Shall we go?

1039
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:47,367
Going twice.

1040
01:17:49,236 --> 01:17:50,637
Going three times and...

1041
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:53,473
...sold.

1042
01:17:53,974 --> 01:17:55,542
Got it.

1043
01:17:55,575 --> 01:17:57,744
Highest bidder
with the gentleman.

1044
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:03,283
- Oh, so sorry.
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1045
01:18:04,451 --> 01:18:06,753
Actually, she's with me.

1046
01:18:06,787 --> 01:18:08,455
Thank you.

1047
01:18:09,456 --> 01:18:10,524
Sorry.

1048
01:18:14,461 --> 01:18:16,697
The package
is rolling to a back area.

1049
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:19,466
I'm on a balcony, first hall
southeast of the auction.

1050
01:18:19,499 --> 01:18:23,203
Marie, meet me here.
Gracie, meet us outside.

1051
01:18:50,031 --> 01:18:52,733
Let's show the people at home
what they won.

1052
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:59,372
500 million's a lot of money,
even for the guy I represent.

1053
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:00,640
Just want to make sure it works.

1054
01:19:00,674 --> 01:19:02,776
The package is in

1055
01:19:02,809 --> 01:19:04,478
an office two halls away.

1056
01:19:04,511 --> 01:19:05,512
Security?

1057
01:19:05,545 --> 01:19:07,748
The buyer has a team.
The seller has an army.

1058
01:19:07,781 --> 01:19:09,016
What do we have?

1059
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,451
Please don't say "each other."

1060
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:18,859
Acetone. Hydrogen peroxide.

1061
01:19:18,892 --> 01:19:20,694
Your file says demolitions.

1062
01:19:20,727 --> 01:19:22,262
Can you make this work?

1063
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:32,906
We will require the full fee

1064
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:34,875
- before you leave.
- Of course.

1065
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,602
What's that?

1066
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,622
Down there, to the left.

1067
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:19,880
Drop your weapons.

1068
01:21:21,514 --> 01:21:22,816
Both of you.

1069
01:21:42,802 --> 01:21:44,437
Go.

1070
01:21:46,706 --> 01:21:48,408
Go.

1071
01:21:56,816 --> 01:21:59,186
Nick!

1072
01:22:01,155 --> 01:22:03,757
I'm going with you.

1073
01:22:06,493 --> 01:22:08,162
I see Mace.

1074
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:10,530
Khadijah.

1075
01:22:14,634 --> 01:22:15,835
The only place
I'll join you is hell.

1076
01:22:23,244 --> 01:22:24,878
Shoot me.

1077
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:29,883
And I'll have him
fire into the crowd.

1078
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:36,523
Can't do it, can you?

1079
01:22:42,929 --> 01:22:44,131
Shit.

1080
01:22:44,165 --> 01:22:45,132
Mace!

1081
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,001
- What are you doing?
- Mace, what happened to you?

1082
01:22:48,035 --> 01:22:49,203
Mace.

1083
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:57,178
- Let's get out!
- Let's get out of here!

1084
01:22:57,211 --> 01:22:58,245
Get in.

1085
01:22:58,279 --> 01:23:00,613
Come with me.

1086
01:23:08,588 --> 01:23:10,991
I can treat her wounds
where we're going.

1087
01:23:11,025 --> 01:23:12,293
And where are we going?

1088
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:13,593
Who are you?

1089
01:23:13,626 --> 01:23:15,996
My name is Lin Mi Sheng.

1090
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:18,099
I work for the Ministry.

1091
01:23:18,132 --> 01:23:20,667
It's nice to finally meet.

1092
01:23:33,646 --> 01:23:34,814
I'm fine.

1093
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,150
Easy.

1094
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:37,650
Yeah.

1095
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:40,520
Would anyone like tea?

1096
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,757
I have a wide assortment
of herbs.

1097
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,192
What the hell is going on?

1098
01:23:45,226 --> 01:23:49,629
We were hoping the CIA would
secure the drive in Paris.

1099
01:23:49,662 --> 01:23:52,866
When that didn't happen,
it was essential we reclaim it

1100
01:23:52,899 --> 01:23:55,236
before it fell into
the wrong hands.

1101
01:24:02,309 --> 01:24:05,046
My father convinced our bosses

1102
01:24:05,079 --> 01:24:07,847
that this could be
a larger opportunity.

1103
01:24:09,116 --> 01:24:10,984
What kind of opportunity?

1104
01:24:15,822 --> 01:24:18,192
I believe you met
Pyotr Khasanov.

1105
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:22,796
If he can disrupt oil
production in the Middle East,

1106
01:24:22,829 --> 01:24:24,664
his profits will skyrocket.

1107
01:24:24,697 --> 01:24:26,699
Raza Magodosh.

1108
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:28,802
Freelance from Dubai.

1109
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:32,639
He promises disruption to any
state willing to pay for it.

1110
01:24:33,873 --> 01:24:36,143
This one is a front
for the Iranians.

1111
01:24:37,111 --> 01:24:39,946
This gentleman is
an international mercenary

1112
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:42,582
specializing in Central Africa.

1113
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:46,820
There are
many rogue players today.

1114
01:24:46,853 --> 01:24:50,690
This was an opportunity
to collect information on them.

1115
01:24:50,723 --> 01:24:54,794
So this was all some kind
of fishing expedition?

1116
01:24:54,828 --> 01:24:56,963
Selling deadly intel
to the highest bidder

1117
01:24:56,996 --> 01:24:58,865
just to see
who's out there bidding?

1118
01:25:00,134 --> 01:25:01,368
We sold them nothing.

1119
01:25:01,402 --> 01:25:03,703
What?

1120
01:25:04,338 --> 01:25:06,107
The drive is right here.

1121
01:25:17,884 --> 01:25:19,853
You killed Marks for that.

1122
01:25:19,886 --> 01:25:21,654
You knocked out the power?

1123
01:25:21,688 --> 01:25:23,090
The planes?

1124
01:25:24,091 --> 01:25:25,625
No.

1125
01:25:27,027 --> 01:25:28,162
Marks did.

1126
01:25:29,163 --> 01:25:31,165
He was working with Nick.

1127
01:25:32,066 --> 01:25:34,801
<i>But if you were
to go out on your own,</i>

1128
01:25:34,834 --> 01:25:37,804
I could understand
how that might happen.

1129
01:25:40,207 --> 01:25:41,875
I knew you'd get it done.

1130
01:25:42,842 --> 01:25:45,045
I stopped him
before they could do more.

1131
01:25:46,913 --> 01:25:49,983
They were working for this man,
Elijah Clarke,

1132
01:25:50,017 --> 01:25:53,887
a known financier for
international terror groups.

1133
01:25:56,423 --> 01:25:58,025
The drive is safe now.

1134
01:25:58,058 --> 01:26:00,161
The world is safe.

1135
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,796
You'll all be going home soon.

1136
01:26:07,067 --> 01:26:08,269
It's done.

1137
01:26:08,302 --> 01:26:10,437
Told you I'd get it.

1138
01:26:10,471 --> 01:26:12,739
Yeah, you did.

1139
01:26:14,141 --> 01:26:15,276
Where's my cut?

1140
01:26:15,309 --> 01:26:17,677
Of course. Your cut.

1141
01:26:27,488 --> 01:26:29,056
We had a deal.

1142
01:26:29,089 --> 01:26:30,757
I got you the drive.

1143
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:32,193
No, you didn't.

1144
01:26:32,226 --> 01:26:37,164
You got me a decoy,
a $500 million paperweight.

1145
01:26:41,168 --> 01:26:43,002
They must have swapped.

1146
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:48,042
They must have swapped it.

1147
01:26:58,018 --> 01:27:00,087
- Hey.
- Hey, it's me.

1148
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:03,224
Listen, I'm sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

1149
01:27:03,257 --> 01:27:06,227
It couldn't be helped.
I don't know what else to say.

1150
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:08,861
I get it. I just, um...

1151
01:27:08,895 --> 01:27:11,498
You know, I just wanted
to know you're okay.

1152
01:27:11,532 --> 01:27:13,367
Well, I'm fine.

1153
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,968
I can handle myself, you know.

1154
01:27:15,001 --> 01:27:16,403
I didn't say you couldn't.

1155
01:27:16,437 --> 01:27:18,771
I'm on the first flight back.

1156
01:27:18,805 --> 01:27:20,107
The sooner I get off this phone,

1157
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:21,975
the faster I can wrap up
and get on that plane.

1158
01:27:22,009 --> 01:27:24,245
Well, I wouldn't want
to keep you.

1159
01:27:24,278 --> 01:27:26,247
I didn't mean it like that.

1160
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,814
No, I get it.

1161
01:27:28,449 --> 01:27:30,117
I'm sorry.

1162
01:27:33,554 --> 01:27:35,089
I'm sorry.

1163
01:27:35,122 --> 01:27:37,258
I'm looking forward
to being home, too.

1164
01:27:37,291 --> 01:27:38,791
Really?

1165
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:43,163
I'll see you soon.

1166
01:27:44,164 --> 01:27:45,299
See you soon.

1167
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:52,239
<i>Hola, mami.</i>

1168
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:21,834
You were dreaming.

1169
01:28:25,004 --> 01:28:27,207
You were having a bad dream.

1170
01:28:29,009 --> 01:28:33,314
Your dream was about how you
didn't see the signs, right?

1171
01:28:33,347 --> 01:28:35,149
When you live a life of lies,

1172
01:28:35,182 --> 01:28:38,085
it's hard to know
what's true and what isn't.

1173
01:28:41,221 --> 01:28:43,223
I thought I knew.

1174
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:49,063
I was in control my whole life.

1175
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:54,134
I took care of myself because...

1176
01:28:59,106 --> 01:29:01,275
...I didn't have anybody.

1177
01:29:04,645 --> 01:29:06,513
I got used to that life.

1178
01:29:06,547 --> 01:29:10,850
It made me
really, really good...

1179
01:29:11,918 --> 01:29:14,054
...at this life.

1180
01:29:15,656 --> 01:29:18,225
I'm sorry you were betrayed.

1181
01:29:21,994 --> 01:29:24,864
I know what that feels like.

1182
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:32,072
Mm-mm.

1183
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:36,009
Maybe you should.

1184
01:29:47,087 --> 01:29:48,255
Mmm.

1185
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,567
Thank you.

1186
01:30:12,746 --> 01:30:14,947
Can I help you?

1187
01:30:14,981 --> 01:30:17,684
Mm. Hoping for some of that tea.

1188
01:30:17,718 --> 01:30:19,119
I'm starting to feel
my face again.

1189
01:30:19,153 --> 01:30:22,456
Chinese herbs
have many qualities.

1190
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:27,194
This will end your pain forever.

1191
01:30:28,462 --> 01:30:31,198
Let me find something
a little less strong.

1192
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,135
So what'd you give 'em?

1193
01:30:35,169 --> 01:30:37,438
You have the drive.
You gave them something else.

1194
01:30:37,471 --> 01:30:39,206
We gave them something close.

1195
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:42,109
That was
a dangerous thing to do.

1196
01:30:42,743 --> 01:30:44,711
That's what we do.

1197
01:30:44,745 --> 01:30:46,079
Right?

1198
01:30:46,113 --> 01:30:49,283
We put ourselves in danger...

1199
01:30:50,217 --> 01:30:52,553
...so that others are not.

1200
01:30:53,454 --> 01:30:57,658
We all look different,
speak different,

1201
01:30:57,691 --> 01:31:00,594
but we are the same.

1202
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:02,563
Thank you.

1203
01:31:08,035 --> 01:31:11,638
Strange how something
so beautiful can be so deadly.

1204
01:31:11,672 --> 01:31:15,108
The way these containers
are set up...

1205
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:19,513
There's no safeguard
for them yet.

1206
01:31:36,663 --> 01:31:38,465
Hands up!

1207
01:31:42,202 --> 01:31:44,238
Clear!

1208
01:31:45,405 --> 01:31:47,374
Clear! Everything's clear here!

1209
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:49,142
That's all of them, boss.

1210
01:31:49,176 --> 01:31:51,011
Well, I guess this is hell.

1211
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,548
Uh-uh.

1212
01:31:54,581 --> 01:31:56,416
Drop it.

1213
01:31:57,684 --> 01:32:02,422
Stop trying to figure a way out
of this and do as you're told.

1214
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:18,071
Where's the drive?

1215
01:32:19,706 --> 01:32:22,309
I took a beating
from my boss for you.

1216
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:30,250
You can be damn sure
the next blood won't be mine.

1217
01:32:33,253 --> 01:32:34,488
Get 'em over there.

1218
01:32:34,521 --> 01:32:36,557
Move.

1219
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:39,059
Move over there. Move.

1220
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,395
Go ahead.

1221
01:32:51,905 --> 01:32:53,440
No, no, no.

1222
01:32:53,473 --> 01:32:55,309
Not my family. No.

1223
01:32:55,342 --> 01:32:58,111
My babies. No, please. No.

1224
01:32:58,145 --> 01:33:00,247
- No, no, no.
- All the people that matter most to you.

1225
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,648
Except for you, Mace.

1226
01:33:01,682 --> 01:33:03,750
You don't have anybody
besides your friends here.

1227
01:33:03,784 --> 01:33:05,285
We understand
you're upset, Nick.

1228
01:33:05,319 --> 01:33:07,688
- We can talk about this.
- I'm gonna ask you again.

1229
01:33:07,721 --> 01:33:09,256
Where's the drive?

1230
01:33:15,762 --> 01:33:16,863
Where's the drive?

1231
01:33:22,202 --> 01:33:24,304
- Shoot him.
- No.

1232
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:29,743
- Where's the drive?
- Wait.

1233
01:33:29,776 --> 01:33:31,912
- Where's the drive?!
- They've got nothing to do with it.

1234
01:33:31,945 --> 01:33:33,880
- Shoot him.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1235
01:33:33,914 --> 01:33:35,415
No!

1236
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:39,486
Where's the drive?

1237
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:43,757
My babies, no.

1238
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,359
Please do something.

1239
01:33:45,392 --> 01:33:46,793
Just so we all
understand each other here,

1240
01:33:46,827 --> 01:33:48,295
I just brokered a sale
that turned out

1241
01:33:48,328 --> 01:33:49,730
to be bad intel
to some people who'd kill

1242
01:33:49,763 --> 01:33:51,665
- everyone you've ever known...
- Please do something.

1243
01:33:51,698 --> 01:33:53,233
- ...to get their hands on that data.
- Please give it to them!

1244
01:33:53,266 --> 01:33:54,735
- Give it to them!
- So if I don't get it

1245
01:33:54,768 --> 01:33:56,670
- before the end of this sentence...
- Give it to them!

1246
01:33:56,703 --> 01:33:57,838
...then that nice woman's gonna
lose that nice little family!

1247
01:33:57,871 --> 01:33:58,572
Stop! Stop!

1248
01:34:00,907 --> 01:34:02,442
Stop it, Nick.

1249
01:34:08,715 --> 01:34:12,252
We'll give it to you, okay?

1250
01:34:17,491 --> 01:34:19,359
May...

1251
01:34:19,393 --> 01:34:21,928
- May I stand?
- No, you may not.

1252
01:34:21,962 --> 01:34:24,264
Where is it?

1253
01:34:40,447 --> 01:34:42,616
Thank you. Now you may stand.

1254
01:34:42,649 --> 01:34:45,452
You're coming with me.
I want to make sure it's legit.

1255
01:34:52,826 --> 01:34:54,327
Now let her family go.

1256
01:34:56,296 --> 01:34:59,533
Please let them go.
Please, please.

1257
01:35:02,869 --> 01:35:04,404
Let 'em go.

1258
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:12,279
It's done.

1259
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:26,259
They're safe, okay?
They're safe.

1260
01:35:26,293 --> 01:35:29,329
Please, please. My babies.

1261
01:35:34,068 --> 01:35:36,503
I'm so sorry.

1262
01:35:56,057 --> 01:35:58,592
Can you turn that off please?

1263
01:36:06,666 --> 01:36:07,701
Mace.

1264
01:36:09,336 --> 01:36:11,304
I didn't do anything.

1265
01:36:11,338 --> 01:36:13,707
Wait a minute.

1266
01:36:17,978 --> 01:36:20,280
It's her glasses.

1267
01:36:22,816 --> 01:36:24,518
She's telling us where to go.

1268
01:36:24,551 --> 01:36:25,685
Right.

1269
01:36:31,424 --> 01:36:32,826
Dijah, what are you doing?

1270
01:36:32,859 --> 01:36:34,761
The job.

1271
01:36:34,795 --> 01:36:36,963
No, you're not in the right
frame of mind for this.

1272
01:36:36,997 --> 01:36:39,699
You need to go home, Khadijah.

1273
01:36:39,733 --> 01:36:41,835
Get out my way.

1274
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:45,072
Dijah, go home.

1275
01:36:45,106 --> 01:36:46,640
Home?

1276
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:23,443
Nanjing Road.

1277
01:37:23,476 --> 01:37:25,679
Six miles west from here.

1278
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:34,654
Look.

1279
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:35,755
It's a hotel.

1280
01:37:38,825 --> 01:37:41,461
Here. Suite. 3004.

1281
01:37:41,494 --> 01:37:44,497
We can access it from the rooms
above and below.

1282
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:46,900
How do we know they're empty?

1283
01:37:47,901 --> 01:37:49,469
They will be.

1284
01:37:52,505 --> 01:37:54,474
I found something.

1285
01:38:05,752 --> 01:38:06,720
Right.

1286
01:38:48,262 --> 01:38:50,664
How much longer
is it gonna take?

1287
01:38:54,534 --> 01:38:57,038
The encryption has
multiple fail-safes.

1288
01:38:57,071 --> 01:38:58,972
It takes time.

1289
01:38:59,005 --> 01:39:00,707
You're running out of it.

1290
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:08,515
I'm sorry that you're here.

1291
01:39:09,549 --> 01:39:11,651
This is my fault.

1292
01:39:11,685 --> 01:39:13,220
I brought all of this
into your life.

1293
01:39:13,254 --> 01:39:15,022
No, you didn't.

1294
01:39:15,056 --> 01:39:16,523
He did.

1295
01:39:17,924 --> 01:39:20,161
You don't have to apologize
for him, Mace.

1296
01:39:20,194 --> 01:39:21,695
We always do that, right?

1297
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:23,830
We think
everything is our fault.

1298
01:39:23,863 --> 01:39:26,167
You didn't bring this
into my life.

1299
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,902
All you did was
trust the wrong guy.

1300
01:39:30,204 --> 01:39:31,905
It's not your fault.

1301
01:39:34,141 --> 01:39:35,942
That's what therapists
always say.

1302
01:39:36,743 --> 01:39:38,611
I'm not a therapist right now.

1303
01:39:47,687 --> 01:39:49,256
Four guards in the main room.

1304
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,790
Six in the street.

1305
01:39:53,027 --> 01:39:54,894
Five minutes,
this will be ready to blow.

1306
01:39:54,928 --> 01:39:56,130
Mace, how's it going?

1307
01:39:56,163 --> 01:39:57,931
I need some more time.

1308
01:39:57,964 --> 01:39:59,766
I can't, I can't get
an angle on it.

1309
01:40:06,773 --> 01:40:08,641
She's almost done
with the decryption.

1310
01:40:09,709 --> 01:40:11,745
Got five percent to go.

1311
01:40:11,778 --> 01:40:13,613
We're not gonna make it, Mace.

1312
01:40:15,049 --> 01:40:16,916
Okay!

1313
01:40:18,718 --> 01:40:20,154
What are you doing?

1314
01:40:20,187 --> 01:40:21,755
Taking the elevator.

1315
01:40:21,788 --> 01:40:23,157
The elevator is the other way.

1316
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:25,825
Mace, don't do this.

1317
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:43,910
We have one minute max.

1318
01:40:43,943 --> 01:40:45,179
I need more time.

1319
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:02,196
We'll take it from here.

1320
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:03,830
Please show our guest out.

1321
01:41:09,103 --> 01:41:10,904
They're taking her out.
We have to move right now.

1322
01:41:25,652 --> 01:41:26,886
I need more time to run the wire

1323
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,988
- to the det cord.
- We don't have it.

1324
01:42:09,163 --> 01:42:10,930
Three seconds.

1325
01:43:05,919 --> 01:43:08,055
Hi.

1326
01:43:08,088 --> 01:43:09,356
Sorry.

1327
01:43:35,216 --> 01:43:37,284
Sorry. This is me.

1328
01:43:48,495 --> 01:43:50,797
I'm out!

1329
01:43:54,568 --> 01:43:56,736
A few more coming through
the front door.

1330
01:44:12,219 --> 01:44:13,920
Incoming!

1331
01:44:20,594 --> 01:44:22,029
You two, on me!

1332
01:44:22,062 --> 01:44:23,464
Come on, let's go!

1333
01:44:23,497 --> 01:44:25,865
Move! Move!

1334
01:44:37,177 --> 01:44:38,245
It's jammed.

1335
01:45:34,268 --> 01:45:37,304
Why didn't you come with me?
Huh?

1336
01:45:41,608 --> 01:45:42,576
Mace!

1337
01:45:57,391 --> 01:45:58,991
I got it.

1338
01:46:01,395 --> 01:46:02,862
I got it.

1339
01:46:06,367 --> 01:46:08,369
No!

1340
01:46:08,402 --> 01:46:10,270
No!

1341
01:46:25,985 --> 01:46:28,955
That was... that was
good shooting, Gracie.

1342
01:46:34,428 --> 01:46:36,430
Here.

1343
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:39,899
Yeah.

1344
01:48:06,153 --> 01:48:08,188
Put a hit out on me.

1345
01:48:09,256 --> 01:48:11,358
A man must cover his tracks.

1346
01:48:11,391 --> 01:48:13,327
Yeah, he does.

1347
01:48:15,095 --> 01:48:17,030
I have ten men outside.

1348
01:48:18,065 --> 01:48:19,800
You had ten men.

1349
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:21,502
Just you and me now.

1350
01:48:26,373 --> 01:48:28,809
You were beaten
by a bunch of girls.

1351
01:48:28,842 --> 01:48:30,777
Should have killed them
when you had the chance.

1352
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:33,013
They're next.

1353
01:48:33,714 --> 01:48:35,249
You're now.

1354
01:48:37,084 --> 01:48:38,785
One reason.

1355
01:48:38,819 --> 01:48:40,821
Give me one reason
you keep breathing.

1356
01:48:40,854 --> 01:48:43,190
I'll give you
a hundred million reasons

1357
01:48:43,223 --> 01:48:45,259
if you carry on working for me.

1358
01:48:46,093 --> 01:48:47,561
I'm good.

1359
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:19,126
Boss, new mission brief.

1360
01:49:19,159 --> 01:49:21,194
It's wheels up in three hours.

1361
01:49:22,829 --> 01:49:24,698
What about Mace and her friends?

1362
01:49:24,731 --> 01:49:26,300
Ah, we're still working on it,

1363
01:49:26,333 --> 01:49:28,335
but they can't
run forever, right?

1364
01:49:28,368 --> 01:49:31,438
I mean, sooner or later,
they got to give up.

1365
01:49:32,472 --> 01:49:34,474
You don't know Mace.

1366
01:49:46,386 --> 01:49:48,355
Nice place.

1367
01:49:55,862 --> 01:49:57,731
I knew you'd show up eventually.

1368
01:49:57,764 --> 01:50:00,200
If you knew I was gonna show
up, one wonders why you didn't

1369
01:50:00,233 --> 01:50:02,703
spend a little bit more
on a better security system.

1370
01:50:03,637 --> 01:50:06,506
You presume
I didn't want you to get in.

1371
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:12,112
You want a drink?

1372
01:50:19,486 --> 01:50:20,687
Ice?

1373
01:50:20,721 --> 01:50:23,223
You know I never take ice.

1374
01:50:24,825 --> 01:50:27,260
Such a tough guy.

1375
01:50:34,635 --> 01:50:37,838
One could ask how is it
you're not behind bars.

1376
01:50:37,871 --> 01:50:39,339
But a better question is:

1377
01:50:39,373 --> 01:50:41,241
How'd you get the Agency
to promote you?

1378
01:50:41,274 --> 01:50:43,477
- It's not much of a mystery.
- No?

1379
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:45,512
Because you were
brokering a deal to sell

1380
01:50:45,545 --> 01:50:47,781
highly classified information
the last time I checked.

1381
01:50:47,814 --> 01:50:51,485
If you think Marks and I are
the only ones that got wise...

1382
01:50:51,518 --> 01:50:54,354
then you never really knew
who you were working for.

1383
01:50:55,989 --> 01:50:58,692
That explains
why I'm on the run.

1384
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:02,262
Well, you broke
a lot of rules, Mace.

1385
01:51:02,295 --> 01:51:04,264
So did your friends.

1386
01:51:04,297 --> 01:51:06,700
You can't expect the guys
in charge to suck that up.

1387
01:51:07,567 --> 01:51:09,770
Because we're not
as useful as you are?

1388
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:15,275
Hey, Nick, remember that story

1389
01:51:15,308 --> 01:51:17,310
that they told us about
in training?

1390
01:51:18,378 --> 01:51:20,847
Washington's female spy.

1391
01:51:20,881 --> 01:51:23,950
During the Revolution. Agent
355's what they called her.

1392
01:51:23,984 --> 01:51:25,919
'Cause they didn't know
her name.

1393
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:28,655
Mm, someone knew her name.

1394
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:31,491
They just didn't want
the world to know it.

1395
01:51:33,794 --> 01:51:37,831
You're mad because I'm on the
payroll and you're on the run.

1396
01:51:37,864 --> 01:51:38,965
It's not right, is it?

1397
01:51:38,999 --> 01:51:41,601
The world's not right, Mace.

1398
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:46,973
The world's changing.

1399
01:51:50,844 --> 01:51:52,746
You okay?

1400
01:51:53,747 --> 01:51:55,682
Yeah.

1401
01:51:57,384 --> 01:51:59,686
Maybe I just need some food.

1402
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,421
Yeah.

1403
01:52:02,556 --> 01:52:05,692
A full day betraying
all that's best in humanity

1404
01:52:05,726 --> 01:52:08,562
really does take it out of you,
doesn't it?

1405
01:52:17,537 --> 01:52:18,705
Wow.

1406
01:52:19,706 --> 01:52:21,475
It's a reunion.

1407
01:52:22,076 --> 01:52:23,677
Sorry about shooting you.

1408
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:25,879
Hmm. It's okay.

1409
01:52:25,912 --> 01:52:27,914
I survived.

1410
01:52:27,948 --> 01:52:29,649
Not sure you will.

1411
01:52:35,689 --> 01:52:36,957
What is this?

1412
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:39,493
Ancient Chinese poison.

1413
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:42,562
Legend says it's
collected by sealing snakes,

1414
01:52:42,596 --> 01:52:45,365
scorpions and centipedes
in a jar,

1415
01:52:45,398 --> 01:52:47,667
forcing them to fight
and devour each other.

1416
01:52:48,802 --> 01:52:51,338
Sort of like the way
you see the world, Nick.

1417
01:52:56,409 --> 01:52:58,311
It was the ice.

1418
01:52:59,546 --> 01:53:00,747
Yeah.

1419
01:53:04,718 --> 01:53:06,787
Heard you were looking for us,
so here we are.

1420
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:11,291
Figured, just like old times,
I'd do the work for you.

1421
01:53:12,126 --> 01:53:14,861
Thanks for everything
you taught me, Nick.

1422
01:53:14,895 --> 01:53:18,832
A girl really does need a guy
to explain it all to her.

1423
01:53:21,935 --> 01:53:23,904
But I'll take it from here.

1424
01:53:24,805 --> 01:53:27,108
Killing me is not gonna
change anything.

1425
01:53:27,141 --> 01:53:28,441
I know.

1426
01:53:28,475 --> 01:53:30,977
I'm not gonna kill you, Nick.

1427
01:53:31,012 --> 01:53:32,712
But you're gonna wish
that I had.

1428
01:53:32,746 --> 01:53:34,881
I have a team coming
to lock you in a cell

1429
01:53:34,915 --> 01:53:36,550
on the other side of the world,

1430
01:53:36,583 --> 01:53:38,718
where you'll spend
the rest of your life.

1431
01:53:38,752 --> 01:53:41,888
You're not the only one
with contacts.

1432
01:53:44,457 --> 01:53:46,560
And I'm not alone anymore.

1433
01:53:50,064 --> 01:53:51,765
Mace.

1434
01:54:01,741 --> 01:54:03,877
See ya, Nick.

1435
01:54:07,081 --> 01:54:08,882
He was right.

1436
01:54:08,915 --> 01:54:10,750
Our agencies are corrupt.

1437
01:54:10,784 --> 01:54:12,385
Everything's corrupt.

1438
01:54:12,419 --> 01:54:13,753
Look at them.

1439
01:54:13,787 --> 01:54:15,589
Taking a walk.

1440
01:54:15,622 --> 01:54:17,624
Living their lives feeling safe.

1441
01:54:18,925 --> 01:54:22,063
They'll never know how close
they came to losing it all.

1442
01:54:22,096 --> 01:54:24,798
And they'll never know
who saved them.

1443
01:54:25,866 --> 01:54:27,168
We've been erased.

1444
01:54:27,201 --> 01:54:28,802
Made invisible.

1445
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:38,845
<i>Hasta nunca.</i> Good luck.

1446
01:54:40,214 --> 01:54:41,748
I'll miss you, Dij.

1447
01:54:41,781 --> 01:54:43,516
Yes, you will.

1448
01:54:44,918 --> 01:54:46,486
Until the next social call.

1449
01:54:46,519 --> 01:54:47,988
Until the next.

1450
01:55:04,804 --> 01:55:06,740
Want to grab a drink?

1451
01:55:07,974 --> 01:55:10,777
Not really.

1452
01:55:10,810 --> 01:55:12,479
Me neither.

1453
01:55:15,482 --> 01:55:17,450
So, I, um...

1454
01:55:17,484 --> 01:55:18,852
Oh, yeah.

1455
01:55:18,885 --> 01:55:20,420
Okay.

1456
01:55:21,755 --> 01:55:23,823
Hey, Marie.

1457
01:55:25,825 --> 01:55:26,726
Bye.

1458
01:55:30,264 --> 01:55:31,932
I doubt it.
