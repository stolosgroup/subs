00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,601
That's not good.

3
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,809
<i>What are you doing, Captain?</i>

4
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,541
I think it's pretty obvious.
I'm stealing this jet.

5
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,750
<i>I think it's pretty obvious</i>
<i>you're trying to.</i>

6
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,673
<i>- You know I can track your jump.</i>
- Yeah, but you know that I know that.

7
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,875
So one of us doesn't know
something else, right?

8
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,541
<i>Ma'am, he's initiated</i>
<i>wormhole sequencing.</i>

9
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,500
<i>Adam, I want you</i>
<i>to listen very carefully.</i>

10
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,958
<i>If you don't abort right now,
I will shoot you out of the...</i>

11
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,041
I'm sorry to interrupt
what I'm sure is gonna be a scary threat,

12
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,625
but if I'm right,
your tracking system is about to…

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,791
…crash.

14
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,250
Okay, let's not die!

15
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,708
Adam!

16
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,583
I'm gonna kill you!

17
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,916
Reed!

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,375
Oh!

19
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,833
Oh no. I'm so sorry.

20
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,375
That's my bad. Hi.

21
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,000
- No.
- Okay. Bye!

22
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,666
Reed! Get your ass back here.

23
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:05,791
Ow!

24
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,000
- Got anything else you wanna say?
- Actually, I...

25
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,375
Huh? No more jokes?

26
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,208
- Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.
- Who talks like that?

27
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,416
Did you order, like, a "Bully Starter Kit"
on Amazon or somethin'?

28
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,791
I mean, do you even hear yourself?
Chuck, we talked about this.

29
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,515
- I didn't say anything.
- Shut up, Chuck.

30
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,500
That's what I'm talkin' about.

31
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,791
<i>There will be an assembly</i>
<i>in the gymnasium now.</i>

32
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,541
<i>Please proceed to the gymnasium.</i>

33
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,375
Not a word.

34
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,666
Mrs. Reed...

35
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,875
See his face?

36
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,625
And, what, you're gonna suspend Adam?
Because what?

37
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,083
You think he started a fight
with that thug Ray?

38
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,333
Was it Ray Dollarhyde again?

39
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,916
It's barely been a year
since we lost his father.

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,625
You could show some compassion.

41
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,958
It wasn't my fault.

42
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,125
I know you, Adam.
I know that mouth of yours.

43
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,750
I know exactly what got you punched.

44
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,000
He was giving me crap
in front of the whole class.

45
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,291
- I couldn't just take it.
- He's twice your size.

46
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,666
Everyone is twice my size.
I've seen babies bigger than me.

47
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,833
- I don't understand you.
- Dad would.

48
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,291
What's going on, honey?
Can you just tell me?

49
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,750
If I keep having to leave work
in the middle of the day,

50
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:28,958
I'm gonna lose my job.

51
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,184
It's the third time
you've been suspended for fighting.

52
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,000
You'd think I'd be better at it by now.

53
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,416
This goes on your permanent record.
Get that? Care about your future?

54
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,291
Do you?

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Son, you'd better start caring,
because the future is coming,

56
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,541
sooner than you think.

57
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,375
Hey, Adam.

58
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,541
Adam, I'm headed out.

59
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,208
Come and have your dinner.

60
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,083
Where you goin'?

61
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,708
Oh, just out to dinner with a friend.

62
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,791
Which friend?

63
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,208
- His name's Derek. We work together.
- You're goin' on a date.

64
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,541
- Not a date. I don't think it's a date.
- Your dress thinks it is.

65
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,958
Oh, it is a date. I am going on a date.
Why am I going on a date?

66
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,666
Can we please stop
saying "date" now? Thanks.

67
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,708
Adam, I'm sorry.
We… we should have spoken about this.

68
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,583
I don't know how to handle it.
Let's talk about it now.

69
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,125
- Dear God, no.
- No! You can have any kind of feeling.

70
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,351
It's normal. As long as we're a team...

71
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,708
Oh! Time to go.

72
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,458
He texted me?

73
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,541
Well, look at that.

74
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,250
It's a whole new world.

75
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,541
- But we will talk about it tonight, honey.
- Mom, wait.

76
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,125
- What?
- Turn around.

77
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,125
- Make good choices, okay?
- Said the boy who got suspended.

78
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,208
I love you, honey.

79
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,291
I love you too, Mom. More than I know.

80
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,500
Listen, while I'm out,
lock up the back.

81
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,791
No ovens, no answering the door,
no video games.

82
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:39,916
Hawking?

83
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,375
What is it? You see something?

84
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,166
Hawking, stop! Hawking!

85
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,833
Hawking!

86
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,041
Whoa!

87
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,500
Oh my God. You scared the crap out of me.

88
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,458
Who's there?

89
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,958
I don't think we should be out here.

90
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,458
We're okay.

91
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,500
Hawking!

92
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,875
Take it easy.

93
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,750
Or, you know, fall down and scream.

94
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,916
- Jeez. Who the hell are you?
- Put the bat down.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,458
Put the bat down.
I'm not gonna hurt you, I promise.

96
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,208
- What are you doing in here?
- Mostly bleeding.

97
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,750
Wait, how old are you?

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,041
- What?
- How old are you?

99
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:08,958
Twelve.

100
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,125
Twelve…

101
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,375
Shit!

102
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,583
- How did you get in my dad's garage?
- I… It was open.

103
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,833
No, it wasn't. And that is a flight suit.
Are you a pilot?

104
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,250
Yeah. Yeah, listen to me. Uh...

105
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,541
Don't... Hey, don't call anyone.
Put the phone down. I won't hurt you.

106
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,833
You said that already.

107
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,125
Well, it bears... God damn it!

108
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,833
Uh, it bears repeating.

109
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,416
That's a lot of blood.

110
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,000
Well… well, I have so much more
in my body. Where's your mother?

111
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,208
On a date.

112
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:40,791
With who?

113
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,166
- What?
- With who? What's his name?

114
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,166
- I don't know. Derek?
- Derek?

115
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,750
Derek. Derek, Derek, Derek.

116
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,791
That's, yes, the guy with the, um…
with the mouth mullet.

117
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,041
- The goatee?
- Yeah.

118
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,291
So say goatee.

119
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,958
- Yeah, he doesn't matter.
- None of them matter.

120
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,541
Oh, uh…

121
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,375
Nice dog.

122
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,458
I'm gonna go inside the house.

123
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,125
I'm gonna get some stuff.

124
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,458
Hey, careful with that.

125
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,583
Stay here.

126
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,291
Come on.

127
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,458
Ah…

128
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,833
Told you to stay in the garage.

129
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,541
And let some creepy dude
just wander around my house alone?

130
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,541
- Yeah…
- I don't think so.

131
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,208
Yeah, believe me. I don't wanna be here
any more than you want me here.

132
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,208
I just gotta stop bleeding long enough.

133
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,083
Gotta dress the wound,
prevent a nasty infection,

134
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,208
and I will be on my merry way.

135
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,041
Don't touch that.

136
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,333
- I was just looking.
- Don't touch my stuff.

137
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,250
- Is this a lightsaber?
- No, it's not.

138
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,833
- Okay.
- No. Enough with the bat!

139
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,375
If I wanted to hurt you, I would have.

140
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:18,000
If I'm being honest with myself,
you have a very punchable face.

141
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,333
- Oh my...
- God! That...

142
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,208
Gah! That bullet
went straight through. Good.

143
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,375
- Cool.
- Wait, wait, wait. Bullet? You were shot?

144
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,500
Yeah... No, actually, no.

145
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:31,333
No, I was stabbed with a bullet.
What do you think, you moron?

146
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,656
- I'm a moron? You're the one who was shot.
- All right, okay, that's it.

147
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,666
That… Wow… That, uh…

148
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,791
That's weird. It farts when I cough.

149
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,125
- Gross.
- Super gross.

150
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,833
I'm gonna go upstairs, grab some stuff.
Stay cool. You can trust me.

151
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,333
Easy for you to say. I'm the one
who ends up in a therapist's office,

152
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,375
telling them about
where the bad man touched me.

153
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh God! That's where you go?
Immediately? You are dark, man.

154
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,333
- Who even are you?
- That is classified.

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,041
Why are you here?

156
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,041
- Also classi… classified.
- Are you in the air force?

157
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,083
When I say "classified,"
what does your brain hear? Chocolate?

158
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,625
- What's with the lightsaber?
- It's not a lightsaber.

159
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,875
Jesus Christ, Adam.

160
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,392
- I need you to play it cool.
- Wait.

161
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,351
- I know playing it cool isn't your thing.
- Wait.

162
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,041
- It never has been...
- Wait, wait! How do you know my name?

163
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,583
You're Adam Reed.
Born February 10th, 2010.

164
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:31,083
Your parents are Ellie and Louis Reed.
Louis would've died about a year ago.

165
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,708
You don't play any sports
because of acute asthma.

166
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,017
Plus you're freakishly small for 12.

167
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,833
You go to Franklin Middle School,

168
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,583
where you've been suspended
two, three times for fighting,

169
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,916
which is ironic
because you can't fight to save your life.

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,375
Hawking! Zip it!

171
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,000
How do you know my dog's name?

172
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,958
Because I named him.

173
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,208
Where are you goin'?

174
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,458
Oh God.

175
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,833
All right.

176
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,833
Here, ready? Deep breath.

177
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:09,916
Hold it.

178
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,291
Three, two, one.

179
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,833
Everybody gets a trophy.

180
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,416
When I was seven,

181
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,083
I ran into a table on the patio.

182
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,750
I got 12 stitches.

183
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,500
Right here.

184
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,708
You knew how to get into my dad's garage.

185
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,291
You knew how to close the fridge.

186
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,208
You knew how to time my breathing.

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,708
We have the same scar.

188
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,041
And you're wearing my dad's watch.

189
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,458
This watch.

190
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,708
This watch.

191
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,250
You're me.

192
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,625
Holy shi...

193
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,541
That's classified. But yes…

194
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,666
I once was.

195
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,916
I can't believe you're future me.

196
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,500
Okay, you came to terms with that
pretty quickly.

197
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,125
It's a little disturbing, actually.

198
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,458
- So why are you here?
- Rescue mission.

199
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,458
I wasn't supposed to land here.
I was aiming for 2018.

200
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,125
- I need to get there as soon as possible.
- Who were you trying to save in 2018?

201
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,125
Really?

202
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,708
Fine. Can you at least tell me
how you got here?

203
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,791
I'll show ya.

204
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,125
What was that?

205
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,458
- Crap.
- What?

206
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,875
Uh, we're gonna switch to plan A,
which is where you come in.

207
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,250
You see, time jets,
like all tech in the future,

208
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,333
is coded to its user's DNA.

209
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,875
Because I'm injured… aah,
the jet won't even clear me to fly,

210
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,875
which means
I can't get in there to fix her.

211
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,458
But guess who can?

212
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,583
There she is.

213
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,708
Away we go.

214
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,208
Okay. Sit down.

215
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,083
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down.

216
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,750
Let's see what we're dealing with here.
All right, some minor shield damage.

217
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,500
Coolant leaks.

218
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,750
I don't know what that is, but when
is a flashing red light ever good?

219
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,875
Ah-da-da-da-da-da.

220
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,333
I know you wanna touch
all the pretty buttons

221
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:13,750
with your sticky little child fingers,
but the reactor has a quantum signature.

222
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,791
You fire it up, they can find us.

223
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,666
If they're here.

224
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,666
Who are "they"?

225
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,958
I'm glad that you didn't ask me that
because "they" are classified.

226
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:25,208
- I already know you're from the future.
- Believe me, I regret that.

227
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,875
I had no intention of coming back
to revisit… this.

228
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,291
Jesus. Okay.

229
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,958
Okay, I've isolated the damaged relays,

230
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,125
so the ship should be able
to start repairing itself.

231
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,541
How long will that take?

232
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,000
Ah, it's at 50% capacity,

233
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,708
so hopefully less time
than it takes me to heal.

234
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,791
Wait.

235
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,458
- Do you remember this?
- Remember what?

236
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,250
This. Right here, right now.

237
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,000
You being here in 2022?

238
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,642
- Know where you're going with this.
- If this is happening to me...

239
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,309
- You're wasting your time.
- That means it already happened to you.

240
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,958
Unless it works like a multiverse,

241
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,892
where each ripple creates
an alternate timeline...

242
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,125
It's not a multiverse!

243
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,500
My God, we watched too many movies.

244
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,833
I just wanna know.

245
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:10,833
Okay.

246
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:16,083
Okay, the prevailing wisdom
is that when I go back to my fixed time,

247
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,291
my memory… our memories,
they reform, they reconcile.

248
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,708
- But not while I'm here.
- Fixed time? What's that?

249
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,333
There's only one place in time
where you belong on a quantum level,

250
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,166
where you're not screwing around
with the cosmos like I am.

251
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,500
That is your fixed time.

252
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,500
Where you actually belong.

253
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,833
So by being here and telling me this,

254
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,416
you may have just changed my whole future?

255
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,625
Honestly? Your future
is pretty tragic either way.

256
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,166
I'm kidding! I'm kidding.

257
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,250
I'm not kidding.

258
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,083
I'm kidding. Let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

259
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,250
So what happens now?

260
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,458
Nothin'. I'm just gonna lay down.
Let this bullet wound heal.

261
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,833
Think about some key
investment opportunities for your future.

262
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,958
- Wait, like Biff from <i>Back to the...</i>
- Are you out of your tiny mind?

263
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,708
Get back in the house before our mother
gets home, and don't make it weird.

264
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,875
Hey.

265
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,458
Yes?

266
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,833
- This is amazing.
- Isn't it, though?

267
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,958
Mind hitting the light on your way out?

268
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,750
Oh, hey. I'm surprised you're still up.

269
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,458
Well, this night's been
full of surprises, mother.

270
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,781
That's chilling. What happened?

271
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:59,166
How was your not-a-date?
Will you be seeing him again?

272
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,583
No. I don't know. I don't think so.

273
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,208
- Hi.
- Hi.

274
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,875
- Me again.
- Yes, it is.

275
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,583
You left your scarf in my car.

276
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,250
- I did. Gosh, thanks.
- Oh, hey there, kiddo.

277
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,083
Oh. This is my son, Adam.
Adam, this is Derek.

278
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,208
Oh, hey, Adam.

279
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,583
Hello. You have a wonderful mouth mullet.
You must be very proud.

280
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh my gosh, Adam.

281
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,250
- Never heard it called that before.
- Well, thanks again.

282
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,333
Sure. See you soon.

283
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,541
Unlikely, but I'll put in
a good word for you.

284
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,791
Okay. Okay. I'll see you at work.

285
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,875
- Yeah.
- Bye.

286
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,458
He seems nice.

287
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,458
What?

288
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,750
You can be a real jerk sometimes.

289
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
You know that?

290
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,458
Hey there. Good morning.

291
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,583
Shouldn't you be at work?

292
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,416
Yeah, I need to pay the insurance
on the house today.

293
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,666
Had it in the calendar,
but I can't find the statement.

294
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,375
With <i>that </i>filing system?

295
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,416
Shocking. It should all be online.

296
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,791
The minute I find myself
with a few extra hours,

297
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,791
I will set up those accounts.

298
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,916
Until then, this is how your dad did it.

299
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,000
Hey, grab a pile.

300
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,041
Sorry. I gotta get to my room
to think about what I've done.

301
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,166
Okay.

302
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,250
I gotta go.

303
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,625
Call me if you need me.

304
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,708
I won't.

305
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,125
Mom's gone to work.

306
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,184
Dad's favorite song.

307
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,767
Yeah, me too.

308
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,125
See, we agreed on something.

309
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,008
Maybe the only thing.

310
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,125
What?

311
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,083
I just… You're… kinda ripped.

312
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,708
Okay.

313
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,000
Do you work out?

314
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,708
- My genetics don't…
- Ever have a thought and not let it out?

315
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,208
Could be fun to just keep it in.

316
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,083
Maybe in the future, there's, like…

317
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,458
like, gene therapy or nanotechnology for...

318
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,181
Don't do it. Don't… don't do it.

319
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,958
So when does… all this happen.

320
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,125
Does everyone skip leg day in the future?

321
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,541
Does it happen in college?

322
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,875
Oh, wait.
Do we get a lot of girls in college?

323
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,625
- I...
- Adam, time travel exists.

324
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,166
It exists. Isn't that crazy?

325
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,166
Every conceptual idea
you have about the universe

326
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,690
has just been thrown out the window.

327
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,541
Yet your big question is, "Do I get laid?"

328
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,083
- Do I?
- Jesus Christ.

329
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,208
- I was just wondering.
- Wonder in silence.

330
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,250
Oh my God! It's gonna happen!

331
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,708
- Where you goin'?
- Drugstore.

332
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,666
I need to get this wound closed up.

333
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,916
You're gonna go dressed like that?

334
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,166
Why don't you wear some of Dad's clothes?

335
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,291
How long ago was Dad's accident?

336
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,458
About a year and a half ago.

337
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,916
She still hasn't cleaned out his closet.

338
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,125
She's not much of a housekeeper.

339
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:05,666
Hey. You have her to take care of you.
She has no one. You understand?

340
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,333
Do you understand?

341
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,625
She wakes up every morning

342
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,833
with a broken heart
and a closet full of his clothes

343
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,796
and gets nothing from you
but a fistful of crap,

344
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,208
and not even, like, ten seconds
of genuine empathy.

345
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,458
I'm you, you know.

346
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:18,583
Tell me about it.

347
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:21,166
You know, 30 years,
you still get sick to your stomach

348
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,583
every time you remember
how you treated her now.

349
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,208
I used to love this jacket.

350
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,000
Dad did too.

351
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,875
I keep waiting to wake up
and miss him less,

352
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,833
but that hasn't happened yet.

353
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,750
Do you still miss him?

354
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,375
Missed him while he was here.

355
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,791
- It's not gonna fit you.
- Sure it will.

356
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,583
How's the jet?

357
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,375
It's gettin' there.

358
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,125
So the person you came to save is in 2018.

359
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:01,416
And somehow, you ended up in 2022.
How does that work? You just missed?

360
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,166
Well, I got shot
when I was stealing the plane.

361
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,416
So, uh… I was losin' blood.
Ship was comin' apart.

362
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,416
I jammed the coordinates.
I didn't have time to double-check 'em.

363
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,666
- Wait, you stole the jet?
- It's encoded to me.

364
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,791
So I didn't exactly steal it.
I borrowed the shit out of it.

365
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,750
- There's a difference. Give me some cash.
- You don't have money?

366
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,416
- We don't use money in the future.
- Really?

367
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,833
Of course we use money in the future.
Stay here.

368
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,041
What's up, Reed?

369
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,375
Crap.

370
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:48,458
Well, look who we have here.

371
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:52,375
Ray, can we just take a break
from the ass kicking today?

372
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,833
I have<i> a lot</i> going on.

373
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:58,083
Hey, guys. Enjoying our suspension?

374
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,208
I am now.

375
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,208
That's my spleen.

376
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,166
I remember these little turd-burpers.

377
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,083
- Hey, man, we're, uh… just playin' around.
- Quiet, Ray. This isn't about you.

378
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Chuck.

379
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,250
Hey, what's goin' on? Huh?

380
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,416
Get it together. Ray's ready.
You're embarrassing yourself.

381
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,166
So you're not gonna break this up?

382
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,458
God, no. That'd be irresponsible of me.

383
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:23,708
You'll just figure out some other way
to pound the crap out of him.

384
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,708
You always do.

385
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,708
He's got a big mouth. I get it.

386
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,291
Point is, this fight needs
to happen right now.

387
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,166
So just give us a second, okay, Ray?

388
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,291
Stretch out. You don't wanna pull a hammy.

389
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,458
What are you doing?

390
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,958
Hey, Ray Dollarhyde has been bullying you
for years

391
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:40,041
because you're small, and fragile,
and you have a big mouth.

392
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,291
But here's the thing.
He doesn't wanna fight.

393
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,833
- I don't wanna fight either.
- He doesn't know that, does he?

394
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:48,250
So you're gonna walk over there,
and you're gonna raise your hands,

395
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,458
and then you're gonna look Ray
right in the eye.

396
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,833
You're gonna smile in a way that says,

397
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:56,916
"I've waited my entire life
for this moment."

398
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,583
Like you can't wait
to watch his soul exit his body.

399
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,291
Then you're gonna drop to your knees

400
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,750
and punch him hard
in the private bathing suit parts.

401
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,353
- I'm sorry, the what now?
- Ah! Are we gonna smoke this banana?

402
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:11,583
Or are we gonna talk about it all day?
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

403
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,583
I'm gonna smoke your banana, motherf...

404
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:20,625
No, no, no, no! No. That…
that's not what we talked about.

405
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,000
Boom!

406
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,291
Oh yeah!

407
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,416
- Nice, man.
- You crying, Reed?

408
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,666
Oh no, Chuck. Look, we made him cry.

409
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,750
It's like he was trying to lose.

410
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,750
Run away, Reed!

411
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:38,833
- What the hell?
- I'm not supposed to do this.

412
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:41,375
Ever hear the expression,
"Every bully has a bully"?

413
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,719
Yours isn't holding up his end
of the bargain, so I'm gonna take over.

414
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:46,391
What are you talking about?

415
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:49,208
You're a good fighter.
You like to kick ass. You're a big kid.

416
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:53,208
But if you go near Adam again,
I'll know, and I will find you, Ray.

417
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:56,541
And it won't be like a couple of kids
in a playground scrap.

418
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,583
I will pull bones out of your body.

419
00:26:58,666 --> 00:26:59,833
I will sharpen them.

420
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:02,833
- I will use them to stab little Chuckie.
- What did I do?

421
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:05,375
Shut your mouth,
or I'll fill it with Ray's feet.

422
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,958
You understand what I'm saying?
Got all of it? The bones?

423
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,517
- Yeah.
- Your feet in Chuckie's mouth?

424
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,625
Good. Are you peeing right now?

425
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,375
- Yeah.
- You're a real streamer.

426
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:17,250
Get yourself home and clean yourself up.

427
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,541
Be the change you wanna see, okay?

428
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,041
God, I hated those assholes.

429
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,541
Oh, come on.

430
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,041
Hey, Adam.

431
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,541
Get out of my stuff and open the door.

432
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:00,125
Put the drone down. It will kill us both.

433
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:03,583
Hey, look, you lost one fight.
I figured you'd be used to that by now.

434
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,083
You coulda helped. You just stood there.

435
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,375
Christ. You're so sensitive.

436
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,375
Hey, you had to lose that fight.

437
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,875
You had to. Trust me.

438
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,625
You don't go from bein' you to bein' me
without gettin' your ass kicked,

439
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,500
a lot, all the time.

440
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,958
I'm sorry if I went too far today.

441
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,458
Shouldn't have done that.

442
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,250
- Who's this?
- Who's who?

443
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,291
Put that back.

444
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,250
You put that back.

445
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,083
As soon as you tell me who she is.

446
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,916
That's my wife, Laura.

447
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:46,791
We have a wife?

448
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,916
No, we do not have a wife anymore.

449
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,708
- Hey.
- Hi.

450
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:18,208
- Aah. Hi, there. How are you?
- Hey, Paul.

451
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:20,250
Been a while.

452
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,291
Yep, how you doin'?
That baby sleeping yet?

453
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,875
Uh, not really. No.

454
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:27,541
No. Well, you'll miss
those days when they're gone.

455
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,208
Ah, I find that hard to believe.

456
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:32,541
Believe it. Babies are pure love.

457
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:36,291
They grow into teenagers,
who grow into be assassins of happiness.

458
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,583
Thank you, thank you.

459
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:40,708
Mm, well,
somethin' to look forward to.

460
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,958
Sorry. It's been a rough day.

461
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,833
Year. Couple of years.

462
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:48,375
Hmm. Your boy still havin' a hard time?

463
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,291
He hates me.

464
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,333
Hmm.

465
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,958
It's not his fault.
He's… he's just dealing.

466
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,291
It's fine. We'll be fine.
It's good. Good, good, good.

467
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,125
I wish I knew what I was doin' wrong.

468
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,708
You're not doin' anything wrong.

469
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,208
Sorry.

470
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,166
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry, you scared me.

471
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,208
- I was eavesdropping. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

472
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,875
You're right, though.
Teenage boys are horrible.

473
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:18,458
It's like living with a urinal cake
that yells at you.

474
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,916
Mothers are usually the ones
who take the hit.

475
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,625
Yeah.

476
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,833
- But I'll tell you somethin'.
- Mmm?

477
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,125
Boys always come back for their mamas.

478
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,666
That's nice.

479
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:38,750
It sounds like
you're speaking from experience.

480
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I am.

481
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,458
You have a good mom?

482
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,083
- I do.
- Oh.

483
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:45,791
I have the best mom.

484
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:49,458
Good.

485
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,333
I hope you're right.

486
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,583
I'm still researching boarding schools
in Fallujah, so…

487
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,333
Good.

488
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:02,291
No, I don't mean that.
He's such a sweet kid.

489
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm crazy about him.

490
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:07,958
We lost his dad in a car accident
year before last.

491
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,625
Yeah. That's tough.

492
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,541
Yeah. You have no idea.

493
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,958
Well, I have some idea.

494
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,333
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

495
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:19,625
Jinx.

496
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,125
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

497
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,291
Aren't you grieving too?

498
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,166
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

499
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,416
I am. Of course I am.

500
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,458
So tell him.

501
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,291
You should tell him.

502
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,000
I don't think he needs it.

503
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,750
You think you're being strong for him,

504
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,458
and the problem with acting
like you have it all together is…

505
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,791
He believes it.

506
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,166
Maybe he needs to know that you don't.

507
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,166
It's okay if you don't.

508
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:18,250
My husband had a jacket just like that.

509
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,500
Oh, this is a classic.

510
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,208
Yeah.

511
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:28,625
It was really nice chatting with you.
I'll see you later.

512
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:30,916
Oh, hey, um…

513
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,375
He doesn't hate you.

514
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,875
He loves you.

515
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,458
More than he knows.

516
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,958
Hey! Hey!

517
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,125
Locked and docked.

518
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,750
Start the area scans for his jet.

519
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,930
Let's find him
and get the hell outta here.

520
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:26,958
Find him.

521
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,500
- So you came back for your wife, Laura?
- We're not getting into that.

522
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:40,958
Hey, she's my wife too.

523
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,708
- You know what? We should get into that.
- Thank you.

524
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,208
Met in the academy.

525
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,333
She was 20 minutes late
to the wrong classroom

526
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,208
in the wrong building.

527
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,333
I offered to walk her
to the right one, and…

528
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,916
Man, I was all in
before we even made it outside.

529
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,708
A couple of years ago,
she didn't come back from a jump.

530
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:10,375
They told me her jet broke up on reentry,
but she was the best pilot in the program.

531
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:14,000
She wrote the book on reentry.
Didn't make sense.

532
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:18,291
And you were trying to get to 2018
'cause that's where she went before?

533
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,541
Yeah.

534
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,083
- What was she doing there?
- I don't know.

535
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,791
They changed the jump logs.

536
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,458
Somebody was hidin' somethin'.

537
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,666
Maybe she saw something
Sorian didn't want her to see.

538
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,333
Wait, "Sorian"?
Maya Sorian, Dad's partner?

539
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,208
- She was always so nice to me.
- Hmm.

540
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,083
Yeah, trust me. She's no friend.

541
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,166
Nope.

542
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,791
After Dad died,
she got rich off of his tech.

543
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,333
Bought all the right people.

544
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,083
Next thing you know,

545
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,583
she has exclusive control
over the most valuable resource on Earth,

546
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,375
time.

547
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:54,416
Wait a minute.
You're saying Dad invented time travel?

548
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Yeah.

549
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,000
Not on purpose.

550
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:01,041
The magnetic particle accelerator.
Remember that?

551
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,500
He called it The Adam Project.

552
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:05,333
Yeah, or as I like to call it,
his favorite child.

553
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,083
So what happened to Laura?

554
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:12,166
Mmm. Well, I think your nice friend Maya
had her killed.

555
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,000
- What?
- Yeah.

556
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,416
That's why I gotta get back to 2018
as soon as possible.

557
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,625
The jet's almost ready.
I'll lay low in the shed.

558
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:21,333
I'll heal for a few more days
until I can get a clean read

559
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,791
and then fly out of your life.

560
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,791
But going back to save her.

561
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,291
Talking to me.

562
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,958
Everything you're doing right now
just to rescue one person.

563
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:33,125
You're changing the future.
That's gotta be against the rules.

564
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,291
You'll feel differently when you meet her.

565
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,125
- And when you lose her.
- What?

566
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:42,875
Grab that bag. Get ready to run.

567
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,416
Why? What's happening?

568
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,791
We're going that way. Be ready.

569
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,583
Move!

570
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:29,000
Stay behind me.

571
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:31,625
Don't you do it! Don't you do it, Reed!

572
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,041
Wanna see something cool?

573
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,541
- That's a lightsaber, dude.
- Quiet now.

574
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,041
Time to go. Let's go.

575
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,333
Hello, Adam.

576
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,125
Reed, don't move!

577
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:07,291
Christos. They'll let anyone
into this time stream.

578
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,000
Who's that?

579
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,166
That's Christos.
We were in the academy together.

580
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,375
He's a decent pilot but a terrible person.

581
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,958
He runs security for Sorian.

582
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,416
Ouchie, with the face. Did I do that?

583
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,041
God, I hope the boss lets me kill you.

584
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,708
In fairness,
though, you did shoot me first.

585
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:27,041
On the bright side, your…
your face now matches your soul.

586
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,965
- Anyone say you talk too much?
- All the time.

587
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,875
- It's come up.
- That's enough.

588
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:35,666
Adam, before this goes any further,
let's just go home, please.

589
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,083
Uh, no!

590
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:39,916
Just… just no.

591
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,916
So you're risking your own young life

592
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,875
over some paranoid delusion
that I somehow killed Laura.

593
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:51,791
I loved Laura.
You were both like family to me.

594
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:55,500
I would never have hurt her.
I hate that it's come to this.

595
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:56,916
Guns.

596
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:02,833
Christos, please escort Adam back to 2050.

597
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:06,041
- You're up.
- Yeah. All right, drop the Mag-Cyl.

598
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,083
- This?
- Yeah.

599
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,958
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right.

600
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,791
Wanna start low or go high?

601
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,583
Stop! Get off him!

602
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,791
Come here!

603
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,166
Move!

604
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:14,333
- What is happening?
- Dying outside your fixed time is messy.

605
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:18,416
- What are you doing here?
- Saving your ass, honey. Behind you!

606
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:27,666
I can't believe…

607
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:32,250
I can't believe you're here.

608
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,166
- Hey.
- Hi.

609
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:49,916
That was awesome.

610
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,166
- We should go.
- Yep. Let's go.

611
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,791
Come on, come on, come on!

612
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,541
Go. Go!

613
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,875
I knew you'd come someday.
I just didn't know when.

614
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,000
Of course I came.

615
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,958
Eyes on the road, please.

616
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,601
They said you lit up on reentry.

617
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,083
That's crap. I have the top reentry stats
in the program.

618
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,166
Oh yeah.

619
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,625
Laura, this is… me.

620
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,708
- Hi.
- Parallel contact, babe?

621
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:44,083
Well, you've always said
that you wished you'd met me earlier.

622
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,416
- Here I am.
- Yeah.

623
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,166
All right, can we maybe
slow down a bit now?

624
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,791
There's no one even following us.

625
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,875
Don't look back. Look up.

626
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,125
Gotta get off this road.
We're too exposed.

627
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,291
Okay, baby, it's about to get busier.

628
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:23,916
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

629
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:39,125
Stop the car.

630
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,291
- What?
- What?

631
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,375
Stop!

632
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,500
Okay, back, back. Go, go, go! Reverse!

633
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,375
Back! Back!

634
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:56,416
Go, go, go, go!

635
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,750
They're leaving.

636
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:18,166
They're not leaving. They're regrouping.

637
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,250
- We have to get off this road fast.
- What road?

638
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:29,208
I… I don't understand.
How did you find us?

639
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:32,333
You don't think I'd be
watching your back, even in the past?

640
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,791
Why did you make the jump back
in the first place?

641
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:38,333
I was analyzing data when I found
something strange in the jump logs.

642
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:40,916
A time jet returning from 2018.

643
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:42,958
How's that strange?

644
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:46,000
Because no one ever flew to 2018.

645
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:48,875
I don't get it.
How did it come back if it never left?

646
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,833
Unless someone went back
and altered the time stream,

647
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:55,583
so the future the jet had left from
had already been changed.

648
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,041
God, it's like I traded my brains
for those muscles.

649
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:03,625
It's a shit deal.

650
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,958
- Cute kid.
- Precious, isn't he?

651
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,541
Don't you just wanna hold him underwater
till the bubbles stop?

652
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,500
Oh, I freakin' hate myself.

653
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,875
How did this happen?

654
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:24,750
That jet that went back?
It was Sorian's.

655
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:27,875
She went back to November 2018
for a reason.

656
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,833
What happened in November 2018?

657
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:32,083
I'll tell ya.

658
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:34,166
This happened.

659
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,958
Your father's
magnetic particle accelerator,

660
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,250
The Adam Project, had just gone online.

661
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,000
That was the first step
toward practical time travel.

662
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,916
Sorian must've come back to 2018

663
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,666
and given her younger self
some kind of future intel.

664
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,750
What for?

665
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,666
My guess is enough future stock tips
to amass her fortune

666
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,666
and get rid of
whatever political obstacles

667
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,031
were keeping her from gaining control
of the time program.

668
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,083
She already had that.

669
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,875
But did she?

670
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:02,416
No.

671
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:04,625
No, she didn't.

672
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,625
No.

673
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:08,000
So this world, our world,

674
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,375
everything has already been changed
by Sorian.

675
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:13,208
And your fixed time, 2050,
is it bad there?

676
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:15,666
- We've seen <i>Terminator,</i> right?
- Obviously.

677
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,291
That's 2050 on a good day.

678
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:22,958
Sorian must've spotted me
and planted an altitude bomb on my jet.

679
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:24,625
Here, eat something.

680
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:27,500
I managed to eject, but it didn't matter.

681
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:29,708
Without my jet,
I was a permanent castaway.

682
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:35,416
So I had to follow protocol,
you know, live out my life here,

683
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,833
avoid contact, minimize my footprint,

684
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:40,500
and hope you were crazy enough
to come look for me.

685
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,291
Alone. All this time.

686
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:44,875
Four years.

687
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,000
That's the job, right?

688
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:49,250
- Yeah, but, baby...
- It's…

689
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,916
It's fine. I got used to being alone.

690
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,750
Not anymore.

691
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:57,541
Hey.

692
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:00,166
I found you.

693
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,833
I found you.

694
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,333
You found me.

695
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:14,416
- I'll take my eyes and ears for a walk.
- Bye now.

696
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,791
You kids have fun.

697
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:22,125
- Hey.
- Hi.

698
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:28,416
Ah, da-da-da-da...

699
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,833
- What's wrong?
- I got shot.

700
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:32,250
- You got shot?
- By a gun, yeah.

701
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,458
- Reed?
- Yeah?

702
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:34,958
- Suck it up.
- Yes, ma'am.

703
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,500
Yes, boss.

704
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,500
- You know what you have to do.
- Nooooo.

705
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,166
No, I came back for you.

706
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:59,083
I know.

707
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:03,125
But we can't have a life here.
Not like this.

708
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:07,833
Now you have to go back to 2018,
and you have to put things right.

709
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:11,333
- You have to put an end to all this.
- What do you mean "put an end to it"?

710
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:14,166
I mean, stop time travel

711
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,541
from ever being invented
and save the future.

712
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,833
Fine, come with me, and we'll...

713
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:22,125
Your jet is meshed for your DNA.
It won't fly with anyone else.

714
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:24,166
- You're smart. You can figure it out.
- Adam!

715
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:28,041
We meet in the program. We meet there.
Do you understand that? We can't…

716
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,583
If I go back and stop time travel,

717
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:33,958
and that's an extremely big "if"
with Sorian on my ass,

718
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:35,791
we never meet.

719
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:38,083
We never happen.

720
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,541
We never happen, Laura.

721
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:42,708
We did happen.

722
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:48,166
Every moment we ever had
will always have happened.

723
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:51,125
Even if we correct the time stream,

724
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:54,875
somewhere in us
will be the echo of this one.

725
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,541
And we will find each other.

726
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:00,708
I really believe that.

727
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:04,208
What if we don't?
What if… what if you're wrong?

728
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:05,625
And you're probably wrong.

729
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,833
When am I ever wrong?

730
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,458
Hey, hey.

731
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,416
I can't do this again, okay?

732
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:21,458
I can't do this again, please.
I can't afford to lose you. Don't do this.

733
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:30,291
What is that?

734
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:32,916
They found us.

735
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:46,583
Damn it!

736
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,666
There's a dirt road around the bend.

737
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,750
- I'll buy you time to get to your jet.
- No, no, no. Hey. I'm not leaving.

738
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,666
- You have to.
- What are you talking about?

739
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,670
- Those guys'll kill you.
- No! I've had years...

740
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,230
I've had years to rig my defenses.
They'll never see me coming.

741
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:01,476
- If they catch you, it's over.
- That's the only reason...

742
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Adam! Stop it! Please.

743
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:06,083
I know you came for me.

744
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,583
Now you have
to leave for me, please.

745
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:10,666
Please.

746
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:18,125
We can fix this.

747
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,333
Hey, I love you.

748
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:24,125
That's why I know
you're gonna find me again.

749
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:26,791
Go.

750
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,458
Go!

751
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:34,791
God damn it!

752
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:15,625
Come on.

753
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:18,666
Come on.

754
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,125
Boom.

755
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:31,125
Jet's not reading me
because of my vitals.

756
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:32,625
I'll need your DNA to start her up.

757
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:36,333
When we get to altitude, the bio stop
will come down, and then I can take over.

758
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:39,375
We have to move fast, or they'll be on us
before we can jump to 2018.

759
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:42,708
- Wait. What? I'm not coming with you.
- Yes, you are. Let's go. We need to go.

760
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:44,291
Christos!

761
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,416
It's good to see you, buddy.

762
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,666
Laura, is that you?

763
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,875
You're not still mad at me
for blowing up your jet, are you?

764
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:56,833
If I'm being honest,
yeah, I'm still kinda pissed.

765
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:09,250
Will you stop and listen to me?

766
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,958
This is my fixed time.
You already had my childhood.

767
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,875
You had adventures, you flew planes,

768
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:17,000
and I'm still the nerd with an inhaler
who gets his ass kicked.

769
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,083
I want the rest of it.

770
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,291
- Want the rest?
- Yeah.

771
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:23,250
Here's the rest of it. Dad's death
screws you up more than you ever realize.

772
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:24,958
You get depressed. You get angry.

773
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:27,625
You wander around school
without making a social dent.

774
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:30,875
College is a high point, until
after a year, you lose your scholarship

775
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:33,708
for something
that is so unbelievably stupid

776
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:35,958
I cannot even say it out loud right now.

777
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:39,458
You end up in the air force.
Turns out you could really fly.

778
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:42,958
And then along comes time travel,
and the whole world starts to fall apart

779
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,583
until the only woman you have…

780
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,000
The only woman you ever loved
gets taken away.

781
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,458
Do you understand me?

782
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,083
Till you lose…

783
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,958
She… she just gets taken away.

784
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:01,125
- There's gotta be more than that.
- There is, kid.

785
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,750
And thanks to Sorian, none of it's good.

786
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:06,458
We can fix it.

787
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,333
- By destroying time travel?
- That's right.

788
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:11,708
How are we gonna do that?
What's your plan?

789
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:14,958
I'm not gonna explain my plan
to a nerd with an inhaler...

790
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:17,184
- You don't have a plan.
- Because I do not have a plan.

791
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,267
- Exactly.
- That is correct.

792
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:20,416
But I know somebody who might.

793
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:24,500
Dad.

794
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,375
Dad.

795
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:28,583
You're gonna find Dad.

796
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,125
Nope.

797
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,375
<i>We're</i> gonna find Dad.

798
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,625
So are you in or are you...

799
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:47,541
Tell your husband
to get his bitch ass out here.

800
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,958
He's busy right now,

801
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,541
but I'll tell him you stopped by.

802
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:14,125
Hello, Laura.

803
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:17,083
You should have stayed dead
the first time.

804
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,208
Now, where is your husband?

805
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,250
Okay.

806
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,166
Here we go. All right, give me your hand.

807
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:30,333
Like that, yep.

808
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,458
Nice, healthy DNA right there.

809
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:36,291
Okay, we'll park it down there,

810
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:37,833
grab on to that railing,

811
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:41,083
hold on for dear life, and try
not to pass out from the G's, okay?

812
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,916
What's a… Jesus!

813
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:25,416
- What's happening?
- That.

814
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,791
What are you doing?

815
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,166
Gotcha!

816
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,541
Hang on.

817
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:07,166
I told you to hang on.

818
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,291
Don't give me that stink eye.

819
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,750
Where you going?

820
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:16,416
Shit!

821
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:21,041
Okay, hold tight.
I've always wanted to try this.

822
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:29,750
Did you just
turn the plane off?

823
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:31,833
Yes, I did.

824
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:36,791
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,

825
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:39,416
oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,

826
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,208
oh my God, oh my God!

827
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,458
Where the hell are they?

828
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:58,750
- They gotta be here somewhere.
- Adam, check your ion readings.

829
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,625
<i>The reactor's damaged.</i>

830
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:03,875
You have one jump left.

831
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,791
If you don't come back now,
you never will.

832
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,333
What do you say, kid? Your call.

833
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:18,083
We don't pull this off,
we're not gettin' back, either one of us.

834
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:28,750
- Punch that shit.
- Oh yeah!

835
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,833
Gotcha.

836
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,041
Come on!

837
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,000
Adam!

838
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,125
I got this.

839
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:09,750
Come on, Reed. Come on.

840
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,000
- Adam!
- I got it!

841
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,333
- Adam!
- I got it!

842
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:17,000
Adam!

843
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,416
Come on!

844
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,375
Let's not…

845
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:21,458
Die!

846
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,958
{\an8}It's not meant to be easy.

847
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:40,916
{\an8}Listen, guys, instead of moaning about it,

848
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,583
{\an8}give yourself permission to be inadequate,
and then get to work.

849
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:47,333
You can't be good at something
unless you're willing to be…

850
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:49,216
…at it first.

851
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:50,958
- Professor Reed.
- Sophie.

852
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,125
It'll take two semesters
just to begin solving that.

853
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:55,208
Oh, good God, at least that.

854
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:58,208
Even then, we'll fail the class,
because this is bonkers.

855
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,625
Sophie, you can do this.

856
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:03,000
Listen, guys,
that is the beauty of physics.

857
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,333
That is the beauty of life…

858
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:19,625
It's really him.

859
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,083
Now, guys.

860
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:23,416
- Yep.
- If you think you've got…

861
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,375
He's so…

862
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:25,625
Yeah.

863
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,791
Alive. Come here for a second. Hey.

864
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:33,041
- Let me do the talking in there.
- We have to tell him what happens.

865
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:35,208
- He doesn't have to die.
- We say nothing, okay?

866
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:37,500
Only what he needs to know.
Everything else…

867
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:39,625
We can't.

868
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,125
I wanna hear you say it,
"I won't tell him." Say it.

869
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,041
- Say it.
- I won't tell him.

870
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,541
Physics is a slog. It's a slog.

871
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:57,625
We are meant to work on problems
that our children will solve.

872
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,416
You might find the odd solution
here or there.

873
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,333
I just got your shirt, by the way.
It's very clever.

874
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:07,708
But you will die
before your life's work is done.

875
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:11,083
Your cold, lifeless husk
will be moldering in the ground

876
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,833
while generations that come after you

877
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:16,166
will be finishing the work
that you started.

878
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,250
To quote the Romans,

879
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:20,500
"Enjoy yourselves.

880
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,833
It's later than you think."

881
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,166
Guy Lombardo.

882
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:28,958
- I am s… I'm sorry?
- Guy Lombardo. That was… Yeah.

883
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:32,125
The quote, um… "It's later
than you think." It's not the Romans.

884
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:35,375
It's a singer.
Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians.

885
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,166
It was Guy Lombardo,

886
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,875
and it was from his 1949 classic,
"Enjoy Yourself."

887
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:42,333
But long before that,

888
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:45,458
it was the Romans
who etched it on their sundials.

889
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:46,791
So, uh… so we're both right.

890
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:49,625
It's interesting that you, uh…
you know that.

891
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,708
I'm sorry, do I know you?

892
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,416
Just auditing the class.

893
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:58,666
Any other questions?

894
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,083
All right, the, uh, reading's
on my website, and I'll see you Tuesday.

895
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:20,958
Adam?

896
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:24,541
Dad.

897
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:26,416
Dad.

898
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,291
Adam?

899
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,833
Is… is this time travel?

900
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:46,541
- He came from 2050 and got you?
- Yes.

901
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,385
- How old are you now?
- Twelve.

902
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:51,125
- Why did you need your 12-year-old self?
- I didn't.

903
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:54,250
- You needed me to fly the jet.
- Jet? There… there's a jet?

904
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:55,208
- My jet.
- Oh.

905
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,091
What I meant was
I didn't need you originally.

906
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,500
- 2022 was a mistake.
- Wh...

907
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:00,500
And you flew this jet?

908
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:02,041
- Yes.
- Did you, though?

909
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:05,416
- Is that my jacket? Looks tight on you.
- That's what I said.

910
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,140
- It's fine.
- Like a condom with buttons.

911
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,101
- This is fun. I'm having fun, are you?
- Condom!

912
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:11,208
And why was 2022 a mistake?

913
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:13,958
- I wasn't supposed to be there.
- You're not supposed to be <i>here.</i>

914
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:16,458
- You don't say.
- They shot him when he stole the jet.

915
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:18,625
- Please don't tell him that.
- You stole a jet?

916
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:22,375
- Why would he need to know that?
- Okay, stop. Both of you stop talking now.

917
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,291
Do you realize
how absolutely wrong this is?

918
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:28,583
You can't be here. You can't be anywhere
but your own timeline.

919
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:32,333
What do you think we're doin' here?
Think we're short of hugs in the future?

920
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:35,208
- There's a reason I need to talk to you.
- I don't... I don't care.

921
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:37,041
- He doesn't care.
- Don't get me wrong.

922
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:40,291
I'm very happy to see you,
and I mean this in the best possible way,

923
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:42,791
but you need to piss off
to where you came from.

924
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:45,958
Anything you say or do
could cause a divergence.

925
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,875
Can you please shut up for a second?

926
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:50,041
- I'm not gonna listen...
- For a second and listen.

927
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:53,208
- Shut the physics fountain in your face.
- What you are doing is reckless.

928
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:54,125
Dad!

929
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:55,208
You okay?

930
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:57,000
God damn it!

931
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:59,000
- In fairness, I...
- It's okay.

932
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:01,125
I asked him nicely
to shut up and listen.

933
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:03,708
- He did no such thing, so…
- It's okay. It's fine. I'm fine.

934
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:05,333
So... Oh, you…

935
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:08,333
That's what you get.
We don't hit people in this family.

936
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:09,416
What was that?

937
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,083
- That's what you get.
- God!

938
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:14,083
How did you turn out to be an asshole?
I thought you loved me.

939
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:15,875
- I do!
- None of it matters anymore.

940
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,666
- Are you kidding me? Of course it matters.
- Dad.

941
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,666
They don't have safeguards
where you come from?

942
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,583
- Dad.
- Protocols?

943
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:22,833
- Maya and I agreed.
- Dad.

944
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:24,500
- There'd be an ethics panel...
- Dad!

945
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:25,708
With real oversight.

946
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,500
None of it matters anymore.

947
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:37,416
Wait. It already happened?
Somebody already altered time?

948
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,291
- Who?
- Sorian.

949
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,166
- Maya?
- Maya.

950
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:44,916
She'd never do that.
She knows the consequences.

951
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,958
- She's been funding my work for years.
- The Adam Project.

952
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:51,375
Yes, I theorized
that with a powerful enough pulse,

953
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,875
we could generate
utilitarian wormholes in space.

954
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:56,375
And we did it four weeks ago.

955
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:59,833
But I was…
I was just playing with the theory

956
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,208
that you can use wormholes
for time travel.

957
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:03,625
That part's theoretical.

958
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:04,809
- Right.
- Still theoretical.

959
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,916
This theory needs to take a leak.
So let's go.

960
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,666
Holy shit!
I'm the godfather of time travel?

961
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,708
Nice hit, Dad.

962
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:15,666
I think I broke my hand.

963
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:21,250
I'm… I'm sorry. This is my fault.

964
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,250
My… my ego. My hubris.

965
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:26,625
My need to be best, to be first,
to be the smartest guy in the room.

966
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:27,541
And here we are.

967
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:29,666
- A disgusting character flaw.
- He didn't know.

968
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,416
- But I should have.
- Yeah.

969
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,458
Mankind has no business tampering
with the mechanics of the universe.

970
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:37,541
There are forces greater than science.

971
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:40,105
Right. That's why we're gonna
put the genie back in the bottle.

972
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:42,833
Destroy time travel
before it's even invented.

973
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:43,916
Uh...

974
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:47,083
What's done, no matter how terrible,

975
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:50,583
should not and cannot be undone
under any circumstance.

976
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,250
Even us being here, talking like this,
we're perverting fate and time.

977
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:57,708
I told you Sorian already did that.
She's had the world by the balls since.

978
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,250
And you know that for a fact?

979
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:01,958
Do you have scientific proof
that she changed things?

980
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:05,250
No, you don't because you can't know.
But I will tell you this.

981
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:10,250
You being here opens up the potential
for catastrophic reconfiguration.

982
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,666
- And that <i>is </i>quantifiable, that...
- Stop. Stop.

983
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:13,958
- Stop.
- Stop what?

984
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,166
- Stop being a scientist.
- But I am a scient...

985
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,250
Be a father.

986
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:22,500
You were always more interested
in the universe than your son.

987
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,059
- That's not true.
- That is true.

988
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,375
And when you're older,
you'll realize that. It...

989
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,708
You know what? It's…

990
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:32,750
That ship has sailed. It's too late
for me. So, you know, whatever. I'm fine.

991
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:34,875
But he needs you.

992
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:40,583
Hmm.

993
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,583
And you? What do you need?

994
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:53,083
I need to go for a walk.

995
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,833
I can't be here, Adam. I… I have to go.

996
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:12,875
- Please don't go.
- I have to.

997
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:15,125
- Please.
- This is… this is bigger than any of us.

998
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:17,916
It's too dangerous
what he's asking me to do. I can't.

999
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:26,500
All right. We'll see each other again.

1000
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:32,166
Wait.

1001
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,041
- I need to tell you something.
- No, you can't say anything else to me.

1002
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,958
I can't know the future.

1003
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:43,708
I'm sorry.

1004
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:47,333
I have to go home.
Your mom and you are waiting.

1005
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:03,541
Yes, Senator.

1006
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:07,375
Except the stability of these wormholes
is no longer a hypothetical,

1007
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:11,708
and the work we are doing here
is simply ahead of the current statutes.

1008
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:15,625
So you can either support my program
and be a part of the future,

1009
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,875
or you can get left behind in the past.

1010
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,333
Hang up the phone.

1011
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:26,625
What are you doing here?
You said I wouldn't be seeing you again.

1012
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:28,208
Did I? Hmm.

1013
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,250
When was that? Remind me.

1014
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:33,541
The last time
you just showed up, two months ago.

1015
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:37,541
Oh, well, for me, it was 32 years ago.

1016
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:40,291
So sorry if I'm a little fuzzy
on the details.

1017
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:43,583
Anyway, times have changed.

1018
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:44,958
You can't be here.

1019
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:49,125
You know the potential for
catastrophic changes to the time stream.

1020
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,934
- It's incalculable.
- God, I was such a nerd.

1021
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:52,416
Will you please just stop talking?

1022
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,875
Everything you asked me to do.

1023
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:58,000
The stock buys, the offshore accounts,
all of it. It's unethical.

1024
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:01,666
- And illegal.
- This isn't a joke. It's dangerous.

1025
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:06,000
The environmental impact alone
from the companies you had me pick

1026
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:07,458
could be devastating.

1027
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:08,625
In fairness to us,

1028
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:11,375
the environment was pretty much toast
before we came along.

1029
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:14,583
And by the way, Maya,
you did it, all of it,

1030
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:19,916
because somewhere inside that cheap suit
and ridiculous ponytail is me.

1031
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,375
I'm leaving.

1032
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:24,875
Where you going?

1033
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:27,708
You seeing someone?

1034
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,041
No, you're not. You're too busy.

1035
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:33,750
Thing is,
you always will be.

1036
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,041
This company is all you will ever have.

1037
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,916
It is your personal life.

1038
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,083
It's your family.

1039
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,916
But this is our legacy.

1040
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:50,166
And if we had let the government
take it from us,

1041
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,458
then everything we sacrificed,

1042
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:55,291
all that loneliness,

1043
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,208
all that loneliness,

1044
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:00,708
would've been for nothing.

1045
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,916
And I did it.

1046
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,708
I fixed that future
where we had been forgotten.

1047
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,458
Then why are you back here now?

1048
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:13,583
I'm back

1049
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:17,791
because we can't control time travel
if it never existed.

1050
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:21,291
And your buddy Adam Reed
is about to betray you.

1051
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,625
Adam? He's just a little kid.

1052
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,791
Yeah, well, that little kid…

1053
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:30,000
…he grows up
to be a very big pain in our ass.

1054
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:33,458
Trust me. You're gonna want this.

1055
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:55,875
What?

1056
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:59,458
I know you think you know more than me
because you're older.

1057
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:01,291
Go away, Adam.

1058
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,958
And I know why you hate him so much.

1059
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:06,916
Really?

1060
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,208
Well, do tell.
I'm on the edge of my seat here.

1061
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:14,083
Holy shit. I wonder what it i...
Was it because he's narcissistic,

1062
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:16,375
or, uh, never came home from work

1063
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,208
or cared more about his job than his son...

1064
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:19,541
It's because he died.

1065
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:23,333
You hate him

1066
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:25,666
because he died.

1067
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:31,083
You <i>made </i>yourself hate him

1068
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,083
because it was easier than missing him.

1069
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,458
And I remember some stuff
that you maybe don't wanna.

1070
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:38,541
Oh yeah?

1071
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:40,583
Like what?

1072
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:42,708
He played catch with us

1073
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,166
almost every night.

1074
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,250
Catch.

1075
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,083
He'd get home from work,

1076
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:53,875
be so tired, and I'd be in the yard
throwing the ball against the pitch back.

1077
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:57,333
- You remember the pitch back, right?
- Oh, I… I remember the pitch back.

1078
01:08:57,416 --> 01:09:00,125
Yeah, he bought it
so he didn't have to play with me.

1079
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:01,208
Nope.

1080
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:06,250
He bought it because they had one
in the window of Altman's.

1081
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:11,583
And every time we passed that store,

1082
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:14,083
I begged him to buy it for me,

1083
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:15,625
so that's what Dad did.

1084
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:21,333
He'd see me throwin' in the yard,
and no matter how tired he was,

1085
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:24,541
he'd always grab his mitt
to come out for a catch.

1086
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:28,625
Things happened to you, to us.

1087
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,541
And we suck at dealing with it.

1088
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,430
I'm starting to think
it's something we do.

1089
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,375
I give Mom a hard time now, and…

1090
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:40,375
I think…

1091
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:45,833
I think it's easier to be angry
than it is to be sad.

1092
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,375
And I guess, when I get older,

1093
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:52,583
I forget that there's a difference.

1094
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,291
How'd you get to be so smart?

1095
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:02,291
How'd you get to be so dumb?

1096
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:21,708
Nice try, asshole.

1097
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,666
Adam, make sure you feed Hawking
before you leave for school, honey.

1098
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:28,666
Oh.

1099
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,500
- You're still here.
- Oh.

1100
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:32,500
And you're cooking.
What are you making? Hi.

1101
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:34,625
Uh, I know you like the Denver omelet.

1102
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,583
That's not a Denver omelet.
That is a cry for help.

1103
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:41,625
The eggs are burnt, and the bacon's
still somehow totally raw.

1104
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,666
Oh, you… Oh, no, no. No, no, no. Wha...

1105
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,833
Do you wanna talk about
why you're still here

1106
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,291
instead of being at work?

1107
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:50,583
I… I… Well, I just wanted to stay home
with you today.

1108
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:54,291
You don't say. I like this guy.

1109
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:56,041
This guy likes you.

1110
01:10:58,208 --> 01:10:59,958
What's going on with you, honey?

1111
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:04,583
Does he seem, uh… does he seem sad to you?

1112
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,208
No.

1113
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:09,916
He's an odd duck, like his dad.

1114
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,250
I happen to collect odd ducks.

1115
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,500
I don't know
if I should've built that game for him.

1116
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:20,166
Shouldn't he be outside,
playing with the rest of the kids?

1117
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,291
How is he gonna find his place
in the world?

1118
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:26,166
"His place in the world"?
He's a kid. We're his place in the world.

1119
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,000
<i>You're</i> his place in the world.

1120
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:33,875
Okay, whatever is going on,
listen, I can tell you the truth

1121
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:36,708
or something
that's gonna make you feel better.

1122
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:39,351
I'd rather cut to it and tell you
the truth, if you're up for it.

1123
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:41,708
I… I'd rather something
that'll make me feel better.

1124
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,125
Yeah, I know.

1125
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:45,250
Kidding. Sort of.

1126
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,291
Okay, tell me.

1127
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:49,708
When you are with us…

1128
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,041
…you're with us 100%.

1129
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:53,958
It's amazing.

1130
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:56,333
And when you're not…

1131
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,875
…it's like… pfft.

1132
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,500
So is he a little lonely?

1133
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,666
Yeah, probably.

1134
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:06,208
But does that make you a shitty guy? No.

1135
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:07,791
I've gotta do better.

1136
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:10,958
Hey, buddy, I have good news for you.

1137
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:14,333
He doesn't need perfect.
He just needs you.

1138
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:18,000
Your cooking makes you
a borderline serial killer,

1139
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:20,333
but the rest of you is pretty awesome.

1140
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:21,958
Ellie.

1141
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:25,000
You know I love you.

1142
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:26,333
Yeah, I know.

1143
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:28,375
I'm extremely lovable.

1144
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Yeah.

1145
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:41,750
Hmm.

1146
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,708
I have to go to work.

1147
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,250
Okay, okay, okay.

1148
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:47,791
And, hey, you got time.

1149
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,333
"It's later than you think."

1150
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:06,375
Really think we can?

1151
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:09,291
Maybe, maybe not. We'll see.

1152
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:11,916
But we're gonna try anyway.

1153
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,916
Destroy time travel. How will we do that?

1154
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,250
This is the world's largest
electromagnetic accelerator.

1155
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:20,416
It's 2018,
so EM technology isn't stable yet.

1156
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,750
So here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna blow this bitch up.

1157
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:25,291
- Blow it up?
- Yep.

1158
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:28,000
How did I live this long?
That's a terrible idea.

1159
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:31,916
Yeah, well, when a bad idea
is the only idea, it becomes a great idea.

1160
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,875
Who said that?

1161
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:35,666
You. Nine years from now,
right before you get arrested.

1162
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:36,875
- What?
- Try to focus.

1163
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:40,166
We'll have to deal with security.
You know this bag of toys you love?

1164
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,416
Yeah.

1165
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,958
Being a geek is about to pay off.

1166
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:50,875
- Reading me?
<i>- Roger that, Red Leader.</i>

1167
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:53,708
This is Butternut Sippy Cup.
Ten-four, over.

1168
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,833
Let's just talk like normal people, okay?

1169
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:56,958
<i>Copy that…</i>

1170
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,458
<i>Red Leader.</i>

1171
01:13:58,875 --> 01:13:59,958
Somethin's wrong.

1172
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:02,666
There's nobody here.

1173
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,666
Which means <i>they're </i>here.

1174
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,791
<i>Sorian warned her younger self
we were coming.</i>

1175
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:07,875
Are you sure?

1176
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:12,500
Oh, pretty sure.

1177
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,875
- Don't move. On your knees.
- I'm sorry. What?

1178
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:19,375
We're taking you back to 2050, Reed.

1179
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:23,125
I can't hear you through the helmet.
It muffles a bit. It's hard to hear you.

1180
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,666
Don't get me wrong,
your outfits are incredible though.

1181
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,625
They're intimidating but also scream,
"Please don't hurt me."

1182
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,958
On your knees.
I won't tell you again.

1183
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:33,083
Well, you… you're right about that.

1184
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:36,333
<i>Adam, what are you doing?
I'm about to get my ass kicked.</i>

1185
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:38,208
Don't worry. He doesn't wanna fight.

1186
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:40,541
They wanna fight.
They really, really wanna fight.

1187
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:42,750
Just look him in the eyes and smile.

1188
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:44,958
<i>Smile in a way that says, "I want this."</i>

1189
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:48,041
"I've been waiting my whole life
for this."

1190
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:50,291
<i>Then hit him
in the private bathing suit parts.</i>

1191
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:51,750
- Adam!
- Roger that.

1192
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:52,833
Pyeow!

1193
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,958
Yeah!

1194
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:18,250
Adam, you're on those cars, right?

1195
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:19,833
Roger that, middle-aged Adam.

1196
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:27,000
Bye. Pfft.

1197
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:32,583
Adam!

1198
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:41,250
Whoo!

1199
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,000
That was invigorating!

1200
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:45,166
- Dad?
- Dad?

1201
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,166
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- This close!

1202
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,625
- That was amazing.
- This close!

1203
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:50,500
- Where's little Adam?
- He's fine!

1204
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:52,000
- Hey, hey!
- Hey?

1205
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:53,125
That's your mother's car.

1206
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:55,708
The car?

1207
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:58,166
What are you doin' here?

1208
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,750
I went to the motel,
and when I didn't find you there,

1209
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:02,666
I… I figured I'd find you here.

1210
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,416
It's not like
you're keeping a low profile, obviously.

1211
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,500
What the hell is this?

1212
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:10,666
Tell you what? You come up with a plan,
and we'll do it your way. Sound good?

1213
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,791
Oh God. Thank God. There's a plan.

1214
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:16,000
I was beginning to think
you were making this up as you went along.

1215
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,041
Adam, I'm goin' inside.
Cover the perimeter.

1216
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:20,291
- No one gets in behind me.
- Sorry. That was harsh.

1217
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,500
Roger Dodger.

1218
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:23,916
<i>Harsh?</i>
<i>You shaved my ass with a Subaru.</i>

1219
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,750
I… I <i>saved</i> your ass with a Subaru, son.

1220
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:27,916
What's Dad doing?

1221
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,416
- Dad's being critical. Big surprise.
- Okay, I...

1222
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,375
You're trying to break into
a highly sensitive, secure facility

1223
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:34,458
with a sixth-grader.

1224
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,375
I am not being critical.
I'm… I'm narrating.

1225
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:41,291
Will you just stop? Stop.
Where the hell are you going?

1226
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,708
To destroy your accelerator,
and I'm gonna enjoy it.

1227
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:45,916
Do you realize
that you have broken every rule?

1228
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,708
You've blown past every conceivable
ethical boundary like it wasn't there.

1229
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:52,125
Yeah? Then why are you here, Dad?

1230
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,666
Because you can't do it without me.

1231
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:04,208
<i>Some people dream of the future.</i>

1232
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:08,458
<i>Here at Sorian Technologies,
we're building it.</i>

1233
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,625
If you destroy the accelerator,
Sorian will simply rebuild it.

1234
01:17:11,708 --> 01:17:14,375
- So what will work?
- What you're after is ISPCA.

1235
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:16,708
Infinitely Shifting
Plasma Containing Algorithm,

1236
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:19,000
which I designed
to stabilize the wormholes.

1237
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:22,666
That is the mathematical equation
that will make time travel possible.

1238
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,250
How do you destroy math?

1239
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:28,708
I've never written the algorithm down
or demonstrated it to another human being,

1240
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,708
so it lives here in the old bean,

1241
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:34,583
and in the subbasement
in a diamond-hard neuromorphic processor.

1242
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:36,541
Are you talking about your penis?

1243
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,291
Can… can we be serious now?

1244
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:39,833
Yes. No. Yes.

1245
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:41,791
It's a hard drive, okay?

1246
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,500
- God, you're such a child.
- Sorry.

1247
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:46,666
There is a crystal hard drive
running the algorithm in a closed loop.

1248
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,125
That is the nerve center
of the accelerator.

1249
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:53,458
So we go there, destroy the hard drive,
prevent time travel from being invented.

1250
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:54,708
Theoretically, time travel...

1251
01:17:54,791 --> 01:17:57,333
Oh my God! You're killing me
with the theoretical.

1252
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,666
- Yes, that should do it.
- Good. Let's do that.

1253
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,250
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1254
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,750
Okay.

1255
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,583
- This is where you work.
- Yes.

1256
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:14,041
Only took you 44 years to bring me here.

1257
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:16,125
Fair.

1258
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,916
I am so keeping this thing.

1259
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,416
- So this is it?
- This is it.

1260
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:04,375
I gotta hand it to you, Dad.
You were not messin' around.

1261
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:07,791
This is where we house the hard drive.

1262
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:10,517
- What happens if you pull it out?
- One of two things.

1263
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:13,125
The accelerator will continue to run
on a dormant loop.

1264
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:16,833
But without the algorithm, no one
will ever be able to program it again.

1265
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:18,958
Or?

1266
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:21,666
Or there's a cataclysmic meltdown

1267
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:25,000
that will destroy all living things
within 100 miles.

1268
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,208
Well, let's hope it's the first thing.

1273
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:49,916

1274
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Maya?

1275
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:53,125
Long time no see.

1276
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:56,125
Oh, this shit's about to get weird.

1277
01:19:56,208 --> 01:20:00,541
Were you really gonna steal that from us?
Destroy everything we've worked for?

1278
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:03,333
Our work was supposed to have
moral ground rules.

1279
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:05,791
- We were gonna change the world.
- Change the world?

1280
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:08,666
The only thing that's changed is you.
Have you lost your mind?

1281
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:11,541
All these years, I funded your work.

1282
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:14,125
I'm not the villain here.
I spent millions...

1283
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:17,041
Hundreds of millions
of my money, my wealth.

1284
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,833
- Mmm.
- Just to fund your every indulgence.

1285
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,250
But this…

1286
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:27,708
This is mine to do with as I please.

1287

1289
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:34,458
give me… the drive.

1290
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,500
No.

1291
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:41,291
Just… no.

1292
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:43,208
I thought you were gonna say that.

1293

Come here.

1294
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,375

What are you doing? Are you crazy?

1297
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:03,041
Oh, I think that's well established.

1298
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,666
Adam, just listen to her.

1299
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,583
It's okay. It's all right.

1300
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:10,208
'Cause Adam's gonna
give me the drive right now.

1301
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:13,916
Shhh.

1303

- Adam?
- Adam?

Hey, beautiful idiot.
If I shoot him, you die too.

1305
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:24,791
Adam?

1306
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,166
I'm thinking it over.

1307
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,101
- What? What do you mean you're thinking?
- Yeah.

1308
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:30,625
- It's a complicated issue.
- What is there to think over?

1309
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:32,142
- It's a big decision!
- No, it's not!

1310
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:34,083
- It's not.
- I need to think it through!

1311

01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:03,250
because no one has a right
to change the future, including us.

1408
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:04,208
It's your future.

1409
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,291
No.

1410
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:07,708
You're my future.

1411
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:09,625
Both of you.

1412
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:12,791
And how lucky am I

1413
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:15,791
that I got to see it?

1414
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:20,958
I haven't been there for you.

1415
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:22,583
And I'm sorry.

1416
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:25,541
But I saw you being born.

1417
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:27,833
I watched you take your first breath.

1418
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,750
And after that happens,
nothing is ever the same again.

1419
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:35,375
You're my son, Adam,

1420
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:37,083
and I love you.

1421
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:41,916
- You're my boy, and I love you.
- Okay. You don't have to do all...

1422
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,416
I loved you
from the first minute that I saw you.

1423
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,583
- And that will never change.
- I… I get that.

1424
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:50,750
- Adam, you're my boy.
- Dad? We really don't have to do all...

1425
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:52,666
- You're amazing.
- Okay.

1426
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,541
- I love you.
- I get it, Dad.

1427
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:55,833
I don't think you do.

1428
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:58,125
- I am proud of you.
- Okay.

1429
01:29:58,208 --> 01:29:59,958
I love you, son.

1430
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:03,458
Know that inside your heart.
Know… Come here.

1431
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:04,583
Come here.

1432
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:09,750
You're my boys,
and you'll always be my boys.

1433
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:11,416
Throughout all time.

1434
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,666
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, buddy.

1435
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:19,916
Don't carry this
around anymore.

1436
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:27,916
I need you, Dad.

1437
01:30:29,666 --> 01:30:31,166
It's so hard without you.

1438
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:34,291
I know.

1439
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:36,333
You're gonna be okay.

1440
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:39,875
- You're gonna be better than okay.
- You don't know that.

1441
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:42,500
Are you kidding me?

1442
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:44,041
Have you seen this guy?

1443
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,625
There's gotta be somethin' we can do.

1444
01:30:53,208 --> 01:30:54,500
I can think of somethin'.

1445
01:30:58,708 --> 01:31:00,166
You really gonna do this?

1446
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,375
Oy.

1447
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:04,958
All right.

1448
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:08,166
All right. Can you do me a favor?

1449
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,708
I don't know if we're gonna
remember any of this,

1450
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:15,500
but maybe there'll be an echo
or somethin', like Laura said.

1451
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:16,833
But just in case,

1452
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,041
give Mom a hug for me.

1453
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:22,708
Would you do that?

1454
01:31:23,541 --> 01:31:26,208
Not one of your lame-ass side hugs either.

1455
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:28,500
I'm talkin'
the break-a-rib kinda hug. Yeah?

1456
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:29,583
Yeah.

1457
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:31,750
Holy shit.

1458
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:33,375
What?

1459
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:39,250
I spent 30 years trying to get away
from the me that was you.

1460
01:31:41,166 --> 01:31:42,833
And I'll tell you what, kid.

1461
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:47,458
I hate to say it,
but you were the best part all along.

1462
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:51,833
- Are we gonna smoke this banana or sit...
- Play ball!

1463
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:07,583
Hey there.

1464
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:09,416
Aren't you late for work?

1465
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,708
Yeah. I need to pay the insurance
on the house.

1466
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:14,500
It's in the calendar,
but I can't find the statement.

1467
01:33:14,583 --> 01:33:17,166
With that filing system? Shocking.

1468
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:19,791
- Shocking.
- It should all be online.

1469
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:21,208
This is how Dad did it.

1470
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:24,083
- Grab a pile, would you?
- I'll be late for school.

1471
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:27,458
Oh my gosh. You're right.
Okay. Have a great day, honey.

1472
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,291
Adam.

1473
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:44,250
Yeah?

1474
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:48,083
Just making sure I wasn't getting mugged.

1475
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:50,083
Maybe you are.

1476
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:55,583
Get over here! Get over here!

1477
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:57,083
Aaargh!

1478
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,083
I love you, honey.

1479
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:04,708
Love you too.

1480
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:08,833
So, as I said earlier,

1481
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:13,000
our goal is to calculate
the variability of gravitational force,

1482
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:16,250
which depends entirely
on whether your path of motion

1483
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:18,791
is toward the Earth or away from it.

1484
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:23,083
So let's define the gravitational force
of the Earth on an object

1485
01:34:23,166 --> 01:34:25,875
by Newton's gravitational formula.

1486
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:30,625
F is equal to big G,
Newton's gravitational constant,

1487
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:33,708
multiplied by m sin 1 times m sin 2

1488
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:35,500
divided by r squared.

1489
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:38,833
And m sin 1 is the mass of the Earth,
m sin e,

1490
01:34:39,583 --> 01:34:44,000
m sin 2 is the mass of the object
the Earth is exerting force on.

1491
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:46,208
- And r...
- Can you believe this guy?

1492
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:51,125
He's been talking for 15 minutes.
Managed to put the entire class to sleep.

1493
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:52,500
…force is directly…

1494
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:53,500
You look awake.

1495
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:54,750
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1496
01:34:54,833 --> 01:34:56,291
I've trained myself to…

1497
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:59,375
To fall fast asleep but keep my eyes open.

1498
01:34:59,458 --> 01:35:00,458
Check it out.

1499
01:35:02,291 --> 01:35:03,916
…gotta believe in the miracle…

1500
01:35:04,541 --> 01:35:07,875
Are you serious?

1501
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:10,208
- Cool, right?
- Yeah.

1502
01:35:10,291 --> 01:35:12,291
- Yeah.
- Super cool.

1503
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:14,375
I'm Adam. Adam… Adam Reed.

1504
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:16,083
Laura Shane.

1505
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:18,208
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1506
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:21,958
- I'll, um… I'll be quiet.
- Okay.

1507
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:24,541
Where do they find these guest lecturers?

1508
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:25,625
Right?

1509
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:30,333
It's like they're genetically engineered
to bore us to death.

1510
01:35:30,416 --> 01:35:32,375
You're totally a guest lecturer,
aren't you?

1511
01:35:33,416 --> 01:35:35,625
- Yes, I am. Yeah.
- Shit.

1512
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:36,708
What's your field?

1513
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:39,000
Um… computational linguistics.

1514
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:40,083
- No way!
- Yeah.

1515
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:42,000
- I don't know what that is. Um…
- Oh.

1516
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:46,375
- What does that have to do with flying?
- Uh… not a damn thing.

1517
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:47,875
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1518
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:51,416
Oh. You're in the wrong place, I think.

1519
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:55,291
- That's subjective. This is Schaefer 309?
- Literally in the wrong place. Farrel 309.

1520
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:56,375
- No.
- Yep.

1521
01:35:56,958 --> 01:35:58,083
- No.
- Yeah.

1522
01:35:58,166 --> 01:36:00,333
I don't think that…

1523
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:01,666
- Yeah. Oof.
- Okay. Oh.

1524
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:03,250
- I knew it.
- Okay. All right.

1525
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:04,833
- Bingo. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

1526
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:06,750
Then I'm in the wrong building.

1527
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:08,791
Actually, you're in the wrong campus.

1528
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:11,958
Then I'm lost.

1529
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,166
Not anymore. I found you.

1530
01:36:24,041 --> 01:36:26,000
I can… I can walk you to Schaefer.

1531
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:30,666
Are you sure? I mean,
I would hate to disturb your sleep.

1532
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,250
I've, uh…

1533
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:36,375
I've got time.

1534
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,541
Plus…

1535
01:36:45,416 --> 01:36:46,333
Okay.

1536
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:47,916
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1536
01:36:48,305 --> 01:37:48,582
