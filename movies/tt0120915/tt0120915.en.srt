2
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,431
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,841
Tell them we wish to board at once.

4
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,665
With all due respect...

5
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:11,006
...the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor
wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,994
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

7
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:16,395
<i>As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...</i>

8
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,290
<i>...and we'd be happy to
receive the ambassadors.</i>

9
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,512
I'm TC-14 at your service.

10
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,593
This way, please.

11
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,795
We are greatly honored
by your visit, Ambassadors.

12
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,666
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:01,390
My master will be with you shortly.

14
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,264
I have a bad feeling about this.

15
00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:09,215
I don't sense anything.

16
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:14,561
It's not about the mission, Master.
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:17,070
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:20,301
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

19
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:23,412
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,440
But not at the expense of the moment.

21
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:28,391
Be mindful of the living
Force, young Padawan.

22
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,427
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:36,413
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

24
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:38,626
These Federation types are cowards.

25
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:41,217
The negotiations will be short.

26
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:44,743
What? What did you say?

27
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:48,016
The ambassadors are Jedi
knights, I believe.

28
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,091
I knew it.

29
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:52,292
They're here to force a settlement.

30
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:56,695
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

31
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:58,450
Are you brain-dead?

32
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,246
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

33
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,778
Send a droid.

34
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:11,518
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

35
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:16,923
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear
for something as trivial as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,297
<i>What is it?</i>

37
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:32,098
This scheme of yours has
failed, Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:35,795
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,181
<i>Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.</i>

40
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:44,473
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.</i>

41
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:48,822
<i>We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.</i>

42
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:52,751
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,510
<i>I will make it legal.</i>

44
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,514
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:02,352
<i>The chancellor should never have
brought them into this. Kill them immediately.</i>

46
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,331
Yes. Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

47
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,243
Captain, look!

48
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,794
Shields up!

49
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:21,692
Dioxis.

50
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,035
<i>They must be dead by now.</i>

51
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,500
<i>Destroy what's left of them.</i>

52
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:42,274
Oh... excuse me.

53
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:45,309
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

54
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:48,765
Blast them.

55
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:55,444
What is going on down there?

56
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,505
We lost the transmission, sir.

57
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:05,045
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

58
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:08,116
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

59
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,619
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

60
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,916
I want droidekas up here at once!

61
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,575
We will not survive this.

62
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,681
Close the blast doors!

63
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,407
That will hold them.

64
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:48,570
They are still coming through.

65
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,702
This is impossible!

66
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,293
Where are those droidekas?

67
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,366
Master! Destroyers!

68
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:09,938
They have shield generators!

69
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,982
It's a standoff. Let's go.

70
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:20,073
They're no match for droidekas.

71
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:21,691
<i>Sir!</i>

72
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,553
They've gone up the ventilation shaft.

73
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,622
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

74
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:40,585
This is an odd play for
the Trade Federation.

75
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:43,705
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

76
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:45,176
<i>Let's split up.</i>

77
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:48,560
<i>Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.</i>

78
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,513
You were right about one thing, Master.

79
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:55,234
The negotiations were short.

80
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:58,768
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

81
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,099
It's Queen Amidala herself.

82
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:04,768
At last we are getting results.

83
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,988
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

84
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,166
<i>You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.</i>

85
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,993
<i>Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.</i>

86
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,657
I was not aware of such failure.

87
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:20,558
<i>I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...</i>

88
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:23,311
<i>...and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.</i>

89
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:26,047
<i>I know nothing of any ambassadors.</i>

90
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,191
You must be mistaken.

91
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,438
<i>Beware, Viceroy.</i>

92
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,133
<i>The Federation has gone
too far this time.</i>

93
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,192
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

94
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,997
You assume too much.

95
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:42,098
<i>We will see.</i>

96
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,145
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

97
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,230
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

98
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,549
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

99
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:04,144
<i>Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?</i>

100
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,165
<i>How could that be true?</i>

101
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:10,592
<i>I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.</i>

102
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:17,352
Senator Palpatine.

103
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,283
What's happening?

104
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,768
Check the transmission generator.

105
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:26,378
<i>A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.</i>

106
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,747
The Federation would not dare go that far.

107
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,948
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

108
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,668
We must continue to rely on negotiation.

109
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:38,956
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

110
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:41,707
And where are the chancellor's ambassadors?

111
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:45,402
This is a dangerous
situation, Your Highness.

112
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:50,218
Our security volunteers will be no match
against a battle-hardened Federation army.

113
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:55,479
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

114
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,874
<i>Yes, Viceroy?</i>

115
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,912
<i>Captain, we've searched the ship
and there is no trace of the Jedi.</i>

116
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:39,631
<i>They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.</i>

117
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:42,209
If they're down here, sir, we'll find them.

118
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:46,863
<i>Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.</i>

119
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,779
Get away!
Get out of here!

120
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:16,637
Was'n dat?

121
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,387
Hey, wait!

122
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:20,666
Oh, mooie-mooie, I love you.

123
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,967
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

124
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,612
I spake.

125
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:26,813
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

126
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,982
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

127
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,169
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

128
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,270
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

129
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:38,213
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

130
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:41,072
Stay down!

131
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,562
You saved my again.

132
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:52,513
- What's this?
- A local.

133
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,232
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

134
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:58,470
More?
"More" did you spake?

135
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,835
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

136
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:07,661
Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city.

137
00:12:08,787 --> 00:12:10,188
A city?

138
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,574
Can you take us there?

139
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,612
On second thought, no.

140
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,313
- Not really, no.
- No?

141
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,510
'Tis embarrassing...

142
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:23,511
...but my afraid my've been banished.

143
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:26,890
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

144
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,850
Terrible tings to me if me goen back dare.

145
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,627
You hear that?

146
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:37,132
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

147
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,710
If they find us, they will crush us...

148
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,323
...grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

149
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:48,445
Yousa point is well seen.

150
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,895
Dis way. Hurry!

151
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:59,463
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

152
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:01,069
Ah, my warning you.

153
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:05,831
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

154
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:09,282
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

155
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,244
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

156
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,132
So good bein home!

157
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:27,754
Hey, yousa.

158
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,161
Stopa dare.

159
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:32,098
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

160
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:33,613
Mesa back.

161
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:36,850
Noah gain, Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

162
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,413
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

163
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:47,159
How wude.

164
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:58,043
Yousa cannot bees hair.

165
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:02,461
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

166
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:07,689
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

167
00:15:07,798 --> 00:15:10,560
Wesa no like da Naboo.

168
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:14,089
<i>Da Naboo tink day so smarty.</i>

169
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,142
Day tink day brains so big.

170
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,671
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

171
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:23,922
Mesa no tink so.

172
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,911
Day not know of uss-en.

173
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,050
You and the Naboo
form a symbiont circle.

174
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:33,651
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

175
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:38,496
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

176
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,999
Then speed us on our way.

177
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,769
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

178
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:46,676
We could use a transport.

179
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:49,706
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

180
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,869
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

181
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:54,601
...'tis goen through...

182
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,697
...the planet core.

183
00:15:58,141 --> 00:15:59,701
Now...

184
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,520
...go.

185
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,055
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

186
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:06,110
Master, what's a bongo?

187
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,241
A transport, I hope.

188
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,337
Deysa setten yousa up.

189
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:14,641
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

190
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:18,353
Any help here would be hot.

191
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,140
Master, we're short on time.

192
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:25,510
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

193
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:27,762
This Gungan may be of help.

194
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:32,861
What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?

195
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,822
Hisen to be pune-ished.

196
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,058
<i>I saved his life.</i>

197
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:42,919
He owes me what you call a "life-debt."

198
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,781
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

199
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:48,925
Binks...

200
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:53,495
...yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

201
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,072
Begone wit him!

202
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:06,868
Count me outta dis one.

203
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:10,039
Better dead here than dead in da core.

204
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,503
Yee gods! What mesa sayin?

205
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:34,466
Dis is nutsen. Oh, gooberfish!

206
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:37,788
- Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o, buta...

207
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:43,039
...a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

208
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:47,868
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

209
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:05,477
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

210
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,298
Yud-say boom da gasser...

211
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:10,399
...den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

212
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:19,683
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

213
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,562
There's always a bigger fish.

214
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:34,642
Mesa tink we goen back now.

215
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:49,246
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

216
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,915
<i>I have the senate bogged
down in procedures.</i>

217
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:56,591
<i>They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.</i>

218
00:18:56,745 --> 00:19:01,191
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

219
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,449
<i>Queen Amidala is young and naive.</i>

220
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,003
<i>You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.</i>

221
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,930
Yes, my lord.

222
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,550
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

223
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:18,968
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

224
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,232
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

225
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:30,472
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

226
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,140
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

227
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,959
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

228
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,970
Wesa dyin' here.

229
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,897
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

230
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:51,018
<i>Monsters out dare. Leak'n in here.</i>

231
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:56,317
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

232
00:19:57,504 --> 00:19:59,331
Power's back.

233
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,501
Monster's back!

234
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,473
Relax.

235
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:13,114
You overdid it.

236
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,690
Head for that outcropping.

237
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,371
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

238
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:14,244
Victory.

239
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:29,211
Dis'n loverly.

240
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,253
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

241
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,677
The queen and I will sign a treaty
that will legitimize our occupation here.

242
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,816
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

243
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:49,407
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

244
00:21:49,604 --> 00:21:54,026
In time, your people's suffering
will persuade you to see our point of view.

245
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,900
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,752
Process them.

247
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,598
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

248
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:02,481
Roger, roger.

249
00:22:57,622 --> 00:22:59,909
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

250
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,540
Get their weapons.

251
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,835
Oh! Yousa guys bombad!

252
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,131
We're ambassadors for
the supreme chancellor.

253
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,359
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

254
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,333
The negotiations never took place.

255
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:15,702
<i>It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.</i>

256
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:17,981
They've knocked out
all our communications.

257
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:21,595
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

258
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:29,418
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

259
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:33,288
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

260
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:36,296
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

261
00:23:36,425 --> 00:23:39,177
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

262
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,656
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

263
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,001
They can't afford to kill her.

264
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:45,205
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

265
00:23:45,236 --> 00:23:47,336
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

266
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:49,407
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

267
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,931
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

268
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,720
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

269
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:58,722
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

270
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,559
We are brave, Your Highness.

271
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:03,869
<i>If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.</i>

272
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:06,740
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

273
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:09,361
Be careful, Governor.

274
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:20,821
We'll need to free those pilots.

275
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:23,592
I'll deal with that.

276
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:27,984
Halt.

277
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,596
I'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor.
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

278
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,543
Where are you taking them?

279
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:34,885
To Coruscant.

280
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:37,638
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

281
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:39,739
Uh, wait. U h, you're under arrest.

282
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:21,750
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

283
00:25:25,403 --> 00:25:27,464
Hello, boyos.

284
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:35,877
There's the blockade.

285
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,856
The shield generator's been hit!

286
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:57,692
How wude!

287
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:09,486
We're losing droids fast.

288
00:26:10,145 --> 00:26:12,606
<i>If we can't get the shield generator fixed,
we'll be sitting ducks.</i>

289
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,168
The shields are gone.

290
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,709
The power's back!

291
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,706
That little droid did it.

292
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,702
<i>He bypassed the main power drive.</i>

293
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:34,373
Deflector shields up at maximum.

294
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:47,908
<i>There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.</i>

295
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:50,911
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

296
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:53,029
Here, Master. Tatooine.

297
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,959
It's small, out of the way, poor.

298
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,260
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

299
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,821
How can you be sure?

300
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:00,722
It's controlled by the Hutts.

301
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:03,675
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

302
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,106
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than landing...

303
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,507
...on a system
controlled by the Federation...

304
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:12,674
...except that the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us the advantage.

305
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,165
<i>And Queen Amidala, has
she signed the treaty?</i>

306
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:23,709
She has disappeared, my lord.

307
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:28,160
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

308
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,476
<i>I want that treaty signed.</i>

309
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:36,114
My lord...
it's impossible to locate the ship.

310
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:38,336
It's out of our range.

311
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,937
<i>Not for a Sith.</i>

312
00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:43,308
<i>This is my apprentice...</i>

313
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:45,391
<i>Darth Maul.</i>

314
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:50,061
<i>He will find your lost ship.</i>

315
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:56,539
This is getting out of hand.

316
00:27:56,616 --> 00:27:58,816
Now there are two of them.

317
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:02,065
We should not have made this bargain.

318
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,649
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

319
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,443
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

320
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:17,284
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

321
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,853
R2-D2, Your Highness.

322
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:23,814
Thank you, R2-D2.

323
00:28:27,432 --> 00:28:28,733
Padmי.

324
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:32,162
Clean this droid up as best you can.

325
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:34,534
It deserves our gratitude.

326
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,161
Continue, Captain.

327
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:42,167
Your Highness, with your permission...

328
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:45,568
...we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

329
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:48,888
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

330
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:51,681
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

331
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,806
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

332
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:59,447
<i>Hello.</i>

333
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,209
Sorry.
Husa are yousa?

334
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:05,462
I'm Padmי.

335
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:08,533
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

336
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:10,939
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

337
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:16,607
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

338
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:20,452
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

339
00:29:20,543 --> 00:29:23,243
Den boom! Getten berry scared...

340
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:26,990
...and grabben dat Jedi,
and pow... mesa here.

341
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,544
Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

342
00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:40,188
- That's it... Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

343
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:44,199
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

344
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,393
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

345
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:08,809
That'll complicate things. Be wary.
I sense a disturbance in the Force.

346
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:13,046
- I feel it also, Master.
- Don't let them send any transmissions.

347
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:20,714
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

348
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:22,415
<i>Wait!</i>

349
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:25,000
Wait.

350
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:31,298
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

351
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:34,441
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

352
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:37,585
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.

353
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:39,466
The queen wishes it.

354
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,607
She's curious about the planet.

355
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:45,212
This is not a good idea.

356
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:47,355
Stay close to me.

357
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:03,831
Moisture farms, for the most part.

358
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:08,548
Some indigenous tribes and scavengers.

359
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:10,814
The few spaceports like this one...

360
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:13,155
...are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

361
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,016
Like us.

362
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:19,387
Dissen berry, berry bad.

363
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,333
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

364
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:45,430
Good day to you.

365
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:48,553
What do you want?

366
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:51,714
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

367
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:55,996
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

368
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:58,495
Boy, get in here now!

369
00:31:58,646 --> 00:32:01,146
My droid has a readout of what I need.

370
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:04,828
What took you so long?

371
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,122
I was cleaning the fan switches.

372
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:09,923
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

373
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:13,633
Let me take thee out back, huh?

374
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:16,537
We'll find what you need.

375
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,790
Don't touch anything.

376
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,919
- Are you an angel?
- What?

377
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,708
An angel. I heard the deep space pilots
talk about them.

378
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,651
They're the most beautiful creatures
in the universe.

379
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:42,489
They live on the moons of Iego, I think.

380
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:44,812
You're a funny little boy.

381
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,736
How do you know so much?

382
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:50,787
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

383
00:32:50,892 --> 00:32:55,188
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

384
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,301
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

385
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:01,636
How long have you been here?

386
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:05,780
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

387
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:08,631
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

388
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,366
...but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

389
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:13,465
You're a slave?

390
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:18,193
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

391
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:21,976
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

392
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:27,841
I got ya.

393
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:37,592
Hit the nose.

394
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:45,594
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

395
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:48,158
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

396
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:52,581
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

397
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,087
Saying of which...

398
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:57,588
...how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?

399
00:33:57,731 --> 00:33:59,891
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

400
00:33:59,982 --> 00:34:01,678
Republic credits?

401
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:04,779
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

402
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,906
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

403
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:11,768
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

404
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:13,685
No, they won't!

405
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:17,981
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

406
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:22,745
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

407
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:26,616
No money, no parts, no deal.

408
00:34:26,787 --> 00:34:31,349
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

409
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:42,402
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

410
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:48,303
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

411
00:34:50,741 --> 00:34:53,035
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

412
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,128
I was glad to meet you too.

413
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:08,216
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

414
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,185
They seemed nice to me.

415
00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:12,147
Clean the racks...

416
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:13,948
...then you can go home.

417
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:24,042
<i>And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?</i>

418
00:35:24,143 --> 00:35:26,143
A few containers of supplies.

419
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:29,439
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

420
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
...not in the amount you're talking about.

421
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,649
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

422
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,200
I'll check back later.

423
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:41,881
Noah gain. Noah gain.
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

424
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:44,397
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

425
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:47,398
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

426
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:04,632
Are you going to pay for that?

427
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:08,201
It costs seven wupiupi.

428
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:21,053
Is this yours?

429
00:36:21,194 --> 00:36:22,894
Who, mesa...

430
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,272
Careful, Sebulba.

431
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:31,366
He's a big-time outlander.

432
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:34,836
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

433
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:39,173
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

434
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:42,194
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

435
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,839
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

436
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,440
- Hi.
- Hi there.

437
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,772
<i>Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.</i>

438
00:36:52,812 --> 00:36:56,531
He picked a fight with a Dug,
an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

439
00:36:56,702 --> 00:37:00,605
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

440
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:04,594
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

441
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:07,094
Thanks, my young friend.

442
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:11,607
But mesa doen nutten!

443
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,689
This storm will slow them down.

444
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,793
Looks pretty bad.

445
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:25,603
Panaka.

446
00:37:25,614 --> 00:37:27,017
<i>Receiving a message from home.</i>

447
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:28,608
We'll be right there.

448
00:37:35,592 --> 00:37:37,852
<i>Here, you'll like these pallies.</i>

449
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:40,402
- Here.
- Thank you.

450
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:43,686
<i>My bones are aching.</i>

451
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:48,341
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

452
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:51,515
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

453
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:54,459
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

454
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,783
You'll never reach the outskirts in time.

455
00:37:56,893 --> 00:38:00,705
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

456
00:38:00,876 --> 00:38:03,612
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

457
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,240
Mom!

458
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:22,778
<i>- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cozy.</i>

459
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:25,622
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

460
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:29,352
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

461
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:31,825
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

462
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,131
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

463
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:46,735
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

464
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,296
He's wonderful.

465
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:51,106
<i>You really like him?</i>

466
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:54,832
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

467
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,583
Where is everybody?

468
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:05,739
Oh, hello.

469
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,340
I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations.

470
00:39:09,498 --> 00:39:11,027
How might I serve you?

471
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:13,238
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

472
00:39:13,257 --> 00:39:17,794
When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer.
I'm building a Podracer.

473
00:39:19,102 --> 00:39:21,606
I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.

474
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,114
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

475
00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:29,075
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

476
00:39:29,156 --> 00:39:32,356
I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations.

477
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:38,428
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

478
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:43,547
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

479
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:52,659
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.
We must bow to their wishes.</i>

480
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:54,753
<i>You must contact me.</i>

481
00:39:55,071 --> 00:40:00,118
It's a trick. Send no reply.
Send no transmissions of any kind.

482
00:40:02,077 --> 00:40:05,146
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

483
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:08,967
What if it is true, and
the people are dying?

484
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:12,241
Either way, we're running out of time.

485
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:27,408
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

486
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,209
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

487
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:32,199
Move against the Jedi first.

488
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,845
You will then have no difficulty in taking
the queen to Naboo to sign the treaty.

489
00:40:37,095 --> 00:40:39,389
At last we will reveal
ourselves to the Jedi.

490
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:42,015
At last we will have revenge.

491
00:40:42,136 --> 00:40:44,936
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

492
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,352
They will be no match for you.

493
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:56,328
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

494
00:40:57,733 --> 00:41:00,569
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

495
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:04,672
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!

496
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,678
How wude!

497
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:09,286
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

498
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:11,207
The Republic's antislavery laws...

499
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:13,455
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

500
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,756
<i>We must survive on our own.</i>

501
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:18,812
Xcuse me.

502
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:22,899
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

503
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,883
<i>They have Podracing on Malastare.</i>

504
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:27,629
Very fast, very dangerous.

505
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,310
I'm the only human who can do it.

506
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:33,388
You must have Jedi
reflexes if you race pods.

507
00:41:34,649 --> 00:41:37,469
Don't do that again.

508
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,952
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

509
00:41:47,085 --> 00:41:48,561
What makes you think that?

510
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:52,791
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

511
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:56,168
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

512
00:41:56,736 --> 00:41:58,096
I don't think so.

513
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:00,271
No one can kill a Jedi.

514
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,932
I wish that were so.

515
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,054
I had a dream I was a Jedi.
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

516
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:11,995
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

517
00:42:12,304 --> 00:42:16,316
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

518
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:24,116
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

519
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,333
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

520
00:42:27,404 --> 00:42:29,404
...on a very important mission.

521
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:32,461
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

522
00:42:32,752 --> 00:42:36,562
<i>Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.</i>

523
00:42:37,566 --> 00:42:38,593
I can help.

524
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,592
<i>I can fix anything.
- I believe you can.</i>

525
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,356
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

526
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:48,137
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

527
00:42:48,293 --> 00:42:51,746
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

528
00:42:51,922 --> 00:42:56,375
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

529
00:42:56,526 --> 00:42:57,726
<i>Podracing.</i>

530
00:42:58,332 --> 00:43:00,525
Greed can be a powerful ally.

531
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:03,575
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

532
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:06,276
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

533
00:43:06,356 --> 00:43:07,800
You could enter my pod.

534
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:12,272
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

535
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:14,183
You could make him think
it was yours...

536
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,462
<i>...and get him to let me pilot it for you.</i>

537
00:43:16,473 --> 00:43:18,073
<i>I don't want you to race.
It's awful.</i>

538
00:43:18,198 --> 00:43:20,801
<i>I die every time
Watto makes you do it.</i>

539
00:43:20,951 --> 00:43:22,995
<i>But, Mom, I love it.</i>

540
00:43:23,695 --> 00:43:26,548
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

541
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,999
Anakin.

542
00:43:29,576 --> 00:43:31,636
Your mother's right.

543
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:35,753
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

544
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:38,109
No.

545
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:48,320
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

546
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:55,985
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

547
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:58,095
We'll find some other way.

548
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:02,450
There is no other way.

549
00:44:02,926 --> 00:44:07,088
I may not like it, but he can help you.

550
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:10,417
He was meant to help you.

551
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:25,537
Are you sure about this?

552
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:28,428
<i>Trusting our fate to a boy
we hardly know?</i>

553
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:30,411
The queen will not approve.

554
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:32,631
The queen doesn't need to know.

555
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,490
Well, I don't approve.

556
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:38,837
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

557
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:40,647
How can you do this?

558
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:43,874
Not on the Republic credits, I think.

559
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,203
My ship will be the entry fee.

560
00:44:47,914 --> 00:44:51,814
Not bad! Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

561
00:44:52,105 --> 00:44:54,942
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

562
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:59,089
<i>What would the boy ride?
He smashed up my pod in the last race.</i>

563
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:01,360
It would take some long time to fix it.

564
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,922
It wasn't my fault. Really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

565
00:45:06,092 --> 00:45:08,236
<i>I actually saved the pod.</i>

566
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,918
Mostly.

567
00:45:10,402 --> 00:45:12,582
That you did.

568
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:15,733
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

569
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:20,145
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance.
The fastest ever built.

570
00:45:20,504 --> 00:45:25,533
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

571
00:45:27,306 --> 00:45:30,902
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee...

572
00:45:31,043 --> 00:45:32,443
...and I supply the boy.

573
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:36,036
We split the winnings 50-50, I think, huh?

574
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,796
If it's going to be 50-50,
I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

575
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,204
If we win...

576
00:45:43,438 --> 00:45:47,138
...you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

577
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:50,732
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

578
00:45:53,078 --> 00:45:55,081
Either way, you win.

579
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:01,835
Deal!

580
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:10,662
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

581
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:21,813
What if this plan fails, Master?

582
00:46:21,974 --> 00:46:24,579
We could be stuck here a very long time.

583
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,390
<i>Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...</i>

584
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:30,707
...and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

585
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,853
And...

586
00:46:33,154 --> 00:46:35,354
...there's something about this boy.

587
00:46:41,784 --> 00:46:44,095
You should be very proud of your son.

588
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:47,075
<i>He gives without any thought of reward.</i>

589
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:50,089
He knows nothing of greed.

590
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,720
He has...

591
00:46:52,504 --> 00:46:54,665
He has special powers.

592
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,259
Yes.

593
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:00,061
He can see things before they happen.

594
00:47:00,182 --> 00:47:02,882
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

595
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,832
<i>It's a Jedi trait.</i>

596
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:07,553
<i>He deserves better than a slave's life.</i>

597
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:11,365
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

598
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:17,185
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

599
00:47:17,854 --> 00:47:19,731
Who was his father?

600
00:47:22,212 --> 00:47:24,006
There was no father.

601
00:47:25,537 --> 00:47:28,990
<i>I carried him, I gave birth,
I raised him.</i>

602
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:32,077
I can't explain what happened.

603
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,781
Can you help him?

604
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:37,766
I don't know.

605
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:43,554
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

606
00:47:57,168 --> 00:47:59,329
Wow, a real astro droid!

607
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:04,559
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

608
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,886
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

609
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:09,421
With this?

610
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:12,125
You're such a joker, Ani.

611
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:15,713
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

612
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:17,923
<i>Come on.
Let's go and play ball.</i>

613
00:48:18,223 --> 00:48:22,086
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

614
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:30,318
Hey, Jar Jar!

615
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:32,237
Keep away from those energy binders.

616
00:48:32,286 --> 00:48:36,122
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

617
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:43,890
My tongue is fat.

618
00:48:44,234 --> 00:48:46,778
My tongue... Wrench.

619
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:49,512
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

620
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,635
I'm stuck.

621
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:59,965
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

622
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:04,561
You don't even know if
this thing's gonna run.

623
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,664
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

624
00:49:06,723 --> 00:49:09,076
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

625
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,340
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

626
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:13,387
My mouth.

627
00:49:13,608 --> 00:49:15,608
<i>Ani, I'm stuck.</i>

628
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,217
My tongue is fat.

629
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:25,332
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

630
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:29,736
Thank you.

631
00:49:46,194 --> 00:49:49,681
It's working! It's working!

632
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:02,519
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

633
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:07,123
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

634
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:08,742
Most of them.

635
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:11,996
Has anyone been to 'em all?

636
00:50:12,454 --> 00:50:13,897
Not likely.

637
00:50:14,256 --> 00:50:17,309
I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.

638
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,442
<i>Ani, bedtime!</i>

639
00:50:20,702 --> 00:50:23,155
There we are. Good as new.

640
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:26,193
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

641
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:30,096
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

642
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:31,555
Go on.

643
00:50:31,706 --> 00:50:33,550
You have a big day tomorrow.

644
00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:35,619
Sleep well, Ani.

645
00:50:38,525 --> 00:50:40,744
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

646
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,385
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

647
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:45,619
Wait a minute.

648
00:50:46,932 --> 00:50:48,992
I need a midi-chlorian count.

649
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:56,428
The reading is off the chart.
Over 20,000.

650
00:50:56,563 --> 00:51:00,143
<i>Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.</i>

651
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:02,004
No Jedi has.

652
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:04,171
What does that mean?

653
00:51:05,038 --> 00:51:06,941
I'm not sure.

654
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,606
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

655
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:21,307
Patience, my blue friend.

656
00:52:21,466 --> 00:52:23,779
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

657
00:52:23,899 --> 00:52:25,695
And we'll be far away from here.

658
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,651
Not if your ship belongs
to me, I think, huh?

659
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:33,558
I warn you, no funny business.

660
00:52:33,752 --> 00:52:36,921
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

661
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:39,343
I have great faith in the boy.

662
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:41,329
He's a credit to your race.

663
00:52:41,478 --> 00:52:45,081
But Sebulba there is going to win, I think.

664
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,723
Oh, no!

665
00:52:53,223 --> 00:52:54,683
Why do you think that?

666
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,054
He always wins!

667
00:52:58,504 --> 00:53:01,317
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

668
00:53:03,034 --> 00:53:05,719
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

669
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:11,875
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say... the boy and his mother.

670
00:53:11,979 --> 00:53:16,065
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

671
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,273
The boy, then.

672
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:27,098
We'll let fate decide, huh?

673
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:30,835
I just happen to have a chance cube here.

674
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:33,773
Blue, it's the boy.

675
00:53:33,974 --> 00:53:35,474
Red...

676
00:53:36,491 --> 00:53:38,301
...his mother.

677
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,969
You won this small toss, outlander,
but you won't win the race!

678
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:54,593
So it makes little difference!

679
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:09,713
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

680
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,660
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

681
00:54:15,741 --> 00:54:17,141
Good morning.

682
00:54:19,284 --> 00:54:22,328
Oh, my. Space travel
sounds rather perilous.

683
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:28,159
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

684
00:54:28,277 --> 00:54:32,063
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

685
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:35,805
- Do what?
- Finish the race, of course.

686
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:40,469
- You've never won a race?
- Well, not exactly.

687
00:54:40,954 --> 00:54:42,767
Not even finished?

688
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,300
Kitster's right. I will this time.

689
00:54:45,651 --> 00:54:47,444
Of course you will.

690
00:55:17,267 --> 00:55:18,787
<i>That's absolutely right.</i>

691
00:55:18,846 --> 00:55:24,434
<i>And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.</i>

692
00:55:24,515 --> 00:55:28,585
<i>I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.</i>

693
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,926
<i>I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.</i>

694
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,240
<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.</i>

695
00:55:43,828 --> 00:55:45,228
<i>Sebulba!</i>

696
00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:58,750
<i>And in the front row,
nearside pole position...</i>

697
00:55:58,925 --> 00:56:01,186
<i>Mawhonic!</i>

698
00:56:02,631 --> 00:56:04,175
<i>A hearty hello...</i>

699
00:56:04,286 --> 00:56:08,156
<i>...to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!</i>

700
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,104
<i>And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...</i>

701
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:19,095
<i>...with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.</i>

702
00:56:22,154 --> 00:56:24,506
<i>And hoping for a big win today...</i>

703
00:56:24,675 --> 00:56:29,554
<i>...Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.</i>

704
00:56:33,954 --> 00:56:39,050
<i>And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker, a local boy.</i>

705
00:56:41,118 --> 00:56:43,545
<i>I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.</i>

706
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:05,450
Be safe.

707
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:08,319
I will, Mom. I promise.

708
00:57:23,969 --> 00:57:26,488
You won't walk away from this one...

709
00:57:26,688 --> 00:57:28,915
...you slave scum.

710
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:32,227
Don't count on it, slime ball.

711
00:57:32,477 --> 00:57:35,480
You're bantha fodder!

712
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,783
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

713
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,131
Remember, concentrate on the moment.

714
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:54,207
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

715
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:55,997
I will.

716
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:58,587
May the Force be with you.

717
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,044
Welcome.

718
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:27,576
Begin the race!

719
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,550
<i>Hey, looks like they're clearing the grid.</i>

720
00:58:42,922 --> 00:58:45,375
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

721
00:58:46,563 --> 00:58:49,449
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

722
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,342
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

723
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:54,443
You should too.

724
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,811
You assume too much.

725
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,183
<i>Start your engines.</i>

726
00:59:39,253 --> 00:59:42,623
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

727
01:00:09,976 --> 01:00:13,196
<i>Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.</i>

728
01:00:23,607 --> 01:00:27,494
<i>It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.</i>

729
01:00:29,051 --> 01:00:30,418
Come on, Ani!

730
01:00:36,821 --> 01:00:38,415
<i>And there goes Skywalker!</i>

731
01:00:38,816 --> 01:00:39,716
Go, Ani, go!

732
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,217
<i>He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.</i>

733
01:01:56,246 --> 01:02:01,549
<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out on the canyon dune turn.</i>

734
01:02:13,158 --> 01:02:16,795
<i>There goes Quadinaros' power coupling.</i>

735
01:02:51,453 --> 01:02:53,689
Where is Master Anakin?

736
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:58,673
Look. Here he comes.

737
01:03:01,715 --> 01:03:04,159
<i>It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.</i>

738
01:03:13,704 --> 01:03:17,240
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

739
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:26,875
<i>Skywalker's spinning out of control!</i>

740
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,653
<i>I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!</i>

741
01:05:35,661 --> 01:05:36,987
Here he comes!

742
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:40,402
<i>At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...</i>

743
01:05:40,491 --> 01:05:43,201
<i>...followed closely by Skywalker!</i>

744
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:44,602
Go, Ani!

745
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:14,158
<i>Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!</i>

746
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,624
<i>It's Skywalker!</i>

747
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:43,516
<i>Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!</i>

748
01:06:43,737 --> 01:06:45,297
Did he crash-ed?

749
01:07:26,138 --> 01:07:29,324
<i>Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!</i>

750
01:08:22,561 --> 01:08:24,354
<i>He's catching Sebulba!</i>

751
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:27,790
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

752
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:01,058
<i>That little human being
is out of his mind!</i>

753
01:09:01,559 --> 01:09:03,159
<i>They're side by side!</i>

754
01:09:37,695 --> 01:09:39,305
I can't believe it.

755
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:41,852
<i>The crowds are going nuts!</i>

756
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:56,262
Mom, I did it! Yay!

757
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:09,060
Good going, Ani!

758
01:10:13,505 --> 01:10:15,398
We owe you everything, Ani.

759
01:10:18,295 --> 01:10:20,189
It's so wonderful, Ani.

760
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:22,910
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

761
01:10:23,215 --> 01:10:25,868
I'm so very proud of you.

762
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:37,604
You!

763
01:10:38,155 --> 01:10:40,249
You swindled me.

764
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:44,019
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

765
01:10:44,445 --> 01:10:45,988
I lost everything.

766
01:10:46,347 --> 01:10:49,567
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

767
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:52,311
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

768
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:55,231
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

769
01:10:55,648 --> 01:10:59,534
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

770
01:11:01,879 --> 01:11:04,498
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

771
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,605
I'm sure they can settle this.

772
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,063
Take him.

773
01:11:20,906 --> 01:11:23,009
Well, we have all the
essential parts we need.

774
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:26,170
I'm going back.
Some unfinished business. I won't be long.

775
01:11:26,335 --> 01:11:29,972
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

776
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:33,802
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

777
01:11:33,894 --> 01:11:38,274
- Get this hyperdrive generator installed.
- Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

778
01:11:46,727 --> 01:11:48,537
These are yours.

779
01:11:52,054 --> 01:11:55,157
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

780
01:11:55,266 --> 01:11:57,626
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

781
01:11:57,685 --> 01:12:00,395
- And he has been freed.
- What?

782
01:12:00,546 --> 01:12:02,356
You're no longer a slave.

783
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:05,968
Did you hear that?

784
01:12:06,852 --> 01:12:09,396
Now you can make your
dreams come true, Ani.

785
01:12:10,155 --> 01:12:11,807
You are free.

786
01:12:15,806 --> 01:12:17,102
Will you take him with you?

787
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:19,633
- Is he to become a Jedi?
- Yes.

788
01:12:20,307 --> 01:12:24,153
Our meeting was not a coincidence.
Nothing happens by accident.

789
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:28,043
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

790
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,717
Anakin...

791
01:12:31,335 --> 01:12:34,739
...training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge.

792
01:12:34,897 --> 01:12:37,600
And even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

793
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:41,111
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

794
01:12:41,754 --> 01:12:43,622
Can I go, Mom?

795
01:12:44,803 --> 01:12:46,383
Anakin...

796
01:12:46,454 --> 01:12:49,354
...this path has been placed before you.

797
01:12:49,561 --> 01:12:51,964
The choice is yours alone.

798
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,725
I wanna do it.

799
01:12:59,831 --> 01:13:02,458
<i>Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.</i>

800
01:13:09,146 --> 01:13:10,723
What about Mom?

801
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:15,651
Is she free too?

802
01:13:16,022 --> 01:13:19,466
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

803
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:22,764
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

804
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:33,629
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

805
01:13:34,014 --> 01:13:36,275
<i>It is time for you to let go.</i>

806
01:13:37,429 --> 01:13:41,709
- I don't want things to change.
- But you can't stop the change...

807
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:45,543
...any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

808
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:48,329
I love you.

809
01:13:53,826 --> 01:13:55,828
Now hurry.

810
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:02,418
Thank you.

811
01:14:02,626 --> 01:14:06,047
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

812
01:14:07,757 --> 01:14:10,176
Will you be all right?

813
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,935
Hello, Master Anakin.

814
01:14:19,059 --> 01:14:23,881
Well, 3PO, I've been freed,
and I'm going away in a starship.

815
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:26,850
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

816
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:31,299
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

817
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:34,282
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

818
01:14:34,475 --> 01:14:36,479
<i>...give you coverings and all.</i>

819
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,280
<i>I'm gonna miss working on you.</i>

820
01:14:38,337 --> 01:14:40,700
You've been a great pal.

821
01:14:40,941 --> 01:14:43,441
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

822
01:14:44,215 --> 01:14:45,324
Sell me?

823
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:46,885
Bye.

824
01:14:47,598 --> 01:14:49,074
Oh, my.

825
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,628
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

826
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:17,287
Ani...

827
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,840
Will I ever see you again?

828
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:25,906
What does your heart tell you?

829
01:15:27,515 --> 01:15:29,742
I hope so.

830
01:15:30,281 --> 01:15:31,909
Yes.

831
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:33,630
I guess.

832
01:15:34,777 --> 01:15:37,346
Then we will see each other again.

833
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:42,711
I will come back and free you, Mom.

834
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,572
I promise.

835
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:55,923
Now, be brave...

836
01:15:56,707 --> 01:15:58,936
...and don't look back.

837
01:15:59,437 --> 01:16:01,337
Don't look back.

838
01:16:45,898 --> 01:16:47,857
Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!

839
01:16:47,867 --> 01:16:49,687
Anakin! Drop!

840
01:16:53,451 --> 01:16:55,736
Tell them to take off!

841
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,072
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

842
01:17:10,648 --> 01:17:12,016
Take off.

843
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:14,402
Over there. Fly low.

844
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:39,176
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

845
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:42,563
- What was it?
- I'm not sure.

846
01:17:42,722 --> 01:17:47,868
But it was well-trained in the Jedi arts.
My guess is it was after the queen.

847
01:17:48,185 --> 01:17:50,438
What are we gonna do about it?

848
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:54,059
We shall be patient.

849
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:55,490
Anakin Skywalker...

850
01:17:56,018 --> 01:17:58,145
...meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

851
01:17:59,697 --> 01:18:02,717
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

852
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:13,896
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

853
01:18:13,947 --> 01:18:18,247
...and you, Governor, are going to die
much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

854
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:23,988
This invasion will gain you nothing.
We're a democracy. The people have decided.

855
01:18:24,146 --> 01:18:26,090
Take him away.

856
01:18:29,393 --> 01:18:31,873
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

857
01:18:32,024 --> 01:18:34,424
...for these rumored underwater villages.

858
01:18:34,582 --> 01:18:37,301
They will not stay hidden for long.

859
01:18:48,788 --> 01:18:50,998
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

860
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,662
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

861
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:56,070
<i>You must contact me.</i>

862
01:19:10,733 --> 01:19:12,234
You all right?

863
01:19:13,345 --> 01:19:15,398
It's very cold.

864
01:19:23,188 --> 01:19:25,825
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

865
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:30,454
A little too warm for my taste.
Space is cold.

866
01:19:30,996 --> 01:19:32,790
You seem sad.

867
01:19:34,457 --> 01:19:39,094
The queen is worried.
Her people are suffering, dying.

868
01:19:39,555 --> 01:19:42,575
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

869
01:19:44,111 --> 01:19:46,372
I'm not sure what'll happen.

870
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,974
I made this for you...

871
01:19:51,575 --> 01:19:53,385
...so you'd remember me.

872
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:56,539
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

873
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:59,275
It'll bring you good fortune.

874
01:19:59,717 --> 01:20:01,288
It's beautiful.

875
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:04,389
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

876
01:20:07,563 --> 01:20:11,284
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

877
01:20:11,462 --> 01:20:14,440
...but my caring for you will remain.

878
01:20:16,584 --> 01:20:19,778
I care for you, too, only I...

879
01:20:20,162 --> 01:20:22,014
Miss your mother.

880
01:20:40,649 --> 01:20:44,528
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

881
01:20:44,737 --> 01:20:46,517
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

882
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:50,400
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

883
01:21:19,371 --> 01:21:22,316
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

884
01:21:22,425 --> 01:21:25,495
<i>With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.</i>

885
01:21:25,596 --> 01:21:28,096
<i>I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.</i>

886
01:21:28,272 --> 01:21:32,760
- May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
- Welcome, Your Highness.

887
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:35,070
It's an honor to finally
meet you in person.

888
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:36,506
<i>Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.</i>

889
01:21:36,715 --> 01:21:40,259
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

890
01:21:40,468 --> 01:21:43,971
<i>I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.</i>

891
01:21:44,813 --> 01:21:47,917
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

892
01:21:48,205 --> 01:21:50,126
There is a question of procedure...

893
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:52,997
...but I'm confident we can overcome it.

894
01:21:53,581 --> 01:21:55,608
I must speak with the
Jedi Council immediately.

895
01:21:55,766 --> 01:21:58,494
The situation has become
much more complicated.

896
01:22:04,421 --> 01:22:06,240
Ani, come on.

897
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:20,231
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

898
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:23,546
Pitty hot.

899
01:22:51,505 --> 01:22:54,933
<i>There is no civility, only politics.</i>

900
01:22:55,818 --> 01:22:59,497
<i>The Republic is not what it once was.</i>

901
01:22:59,905 --> 01:23:04,951
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

902
01:23:05,732 --> 01:23:09,061
There is no interest in the common good.

903
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:11,809
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

904
01:23:11,868 --> 01:23:14,648
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

905
01:23:14,799 --> 01:23:17,599
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

906
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:21,896
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

907
01:23:21,965 --> 01:23:25,971
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

908
01:23:26,107 --> 01:23:29,952
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

909
01:23:30,569 --> 01:23:33,433
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

910
01:23:33,534 --> 01:23:35,634
...of a stronger supreme chancellor...

911
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:40,012
...one who could control the bureaucrats
and give us justice.

912
01:23:40,681 --> 01:23:46,370
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

913
01:23:46,549 --> 01:23:49,009
He has been our strongest supporter.

914
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:54,109
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

915
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:58,103
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

916
01:23:58,669 --> 01:24:01,113
<i>Our people are dying, Senator.</i>

917
01:24:01,475 --> 01:24:04,453
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

918
01:24:04,704 --> 01:24:07,300
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

919
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,101
...I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

920
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:12,329
...for the time being.

921
01:24:14,348 --> 01:24:16,642
That is something I cannot do.

922
01:24:23,773 --> 01:24:26,067
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

923
01:24:26,275 --> 01:24:30,171
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

924
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:31,708
Impossible.

925
01:24:31,809 --> 01:24:34,409
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

926
01:24:34,825 --> 01:24:38,704
<i>I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.</i>

927
01:24:39,696 --> 01:24:41,916
Hard to see, the dark side is.

928
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:44,894
<i>We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.</i>

929
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:48,486
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

930
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:50,430
May the Force be with you.

931
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:55,513
Master Qui-Gon.

932
01:24:56,472 --> 01:24:58,883
<i>More to say have you?</i>

933
01:25:00,351 --> 01:25:02,295
With your permission, my master...

934
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,799
I have encountered a vergence
in the Force.

935
01:25:07,942 --> 01:25:10,002
A vergence, you say.

936
01:25:10,111 --> 01:25:12,271
Located around a person?

937
01:25:12,379 --> 01:25:13,823
A boy.

938
01:25:13,971 --> 01:25:18,175
His cells have the highest concentration
of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form.

939
01:25:18,304 --> 01:25:21,398
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

940
01:25:22,999 --> 01:25:26,669
<i>You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.</i>

941
01:25:27,645 --> 01:25:29,663
You believe it's this boy?

942
01:25:29,941 --> 01:25:32,760
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.

943
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,944
Revealed your opinion is.

944
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:37,179
I request the boy be tested, Master.

945
01:25:39,321 --> 01:25:42,616
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

946
01:25:42,935 --> 01:25:47,381
Finding him was the will of the Force.
I have no doubt of that.

947
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:56,115
Bring him before us, then.

948
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:08,992
The boy's here to see Padmי.

949
01:26:09,105 --> 01:26:10,705
<i>Let him in.</i>

950
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:17,094
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmי's
not here right now.

951
01:26:18,187 --> 01:26:19,638
<i>Who is it?</i>

952
01:26:19,973 --> 01:26:23,668
<i>Anakin Skywalker to see
Padmי, Your Highness.</i>

953
01:26:23,776 --> 01:26:27,455
- I've sent Padmי on an errand.
- I'm on my way to the Jedi temple...

954
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:30,658
...to start my training, I hope.

955
01:26:30,817 --> 01:26:34,495
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

956
01:26:35,587 --> 01:26:39,308
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

957
01:26:40,284 --> 01:26:41,702
Thank you, Your Highness.

958
01:26:55,494 --> 01:26:59,915
<i>The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.</i>

959
01:27:06,527 --> 01:27:09,830
<i>Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate.</i>

960
01:27:11,023 --> 01:27:13,067
A tragedy has occurred...

961
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:16,696
...which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

962
01:27:17,144 --> 01:27:22,349
...and has now engulfed our entire planet
in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

963
01:27:22,952 --> 01:27:24,431
This is outrageous!

964
01:27:24,685 --> 01:27:27,185
I object to the senator's statements.

965
01:27:27,315 --> 01:27:31,252
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

966
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:35,189
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

967
01:27:35,298 --> 01:27:39,961
...recently elected ruler of the Naboo,
who speaks on our behalf.

968
01:27:45,482 --> 01:27:48,310
Honorable representatives
of the Republic.

969
01:27:48,828 --> 01:27:51,482
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

970
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:54,494
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

971
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:57,945
<i>I object!
There is no proof!</i>

972
01:27:58,362 --> 01:28:00,181
This is incredible.

973
01:28:00,389 --> 01:28:04,243
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

974
01:28:04,336 --> 01:28:05,690
The Congress of Malastare...

975
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:08,691
...concurs with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

976
01:28:08,828 --> 01:28:10,757
A commission must be appointed.

977
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:13,458
- The point...
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

978
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:15,230
<i>Enter the bureaucrat.</i>

979
01:28:15,404 --> 01:28:17,925
The true rulers of the Republic.

980
01:28:18,055 --> 01:28:22,124
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

981
01:28:22,303 --> 01:28:26,982
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

982
01:28:28,255 --> 01:28:30,483
<i>The point is conceded.</i>

983
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:36,135
Will you defer your motion to allow a commission
to explore the validity of your accusations?

984
01:28:36,475 --> 01:28:38,075
I will not defer.

985
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:41,605
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

986
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:45,222
<i>I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...</i>

987
01:28:45,242 --> 01:28:48,722
<i>...while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.</i>

988
01:28:50,623 --> 01:28:55,261
If this body is not capable of action
I suggest new leadership is needed.

989
01:28:58,455 --> 01:29:03,110
I move for a vote of no confidence
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

990
01:29:15,831 --> 01:29:17,466
Order!

991
01:29:17,942 --> 01:29:22,830
Now they will elect a new chancellor...
a strong chancellor.

992
01:29:22,938 --> 01:29:25,983
One who will not let
our tragedy continue.

993
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:31,900
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

994
01:29:32,064 --> 01:29:35,001
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

995
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:37,853
Do not defy the council, Master, not again.

996
01:29:38,154 --> 01:29:40,614
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

997
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:46,462
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

998
01:29:46,727 --> 01:29:49,414
They will not go along with you this time.

999
01:29:50,032 --> 01:29:53,303
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1000
01:29:56,047 --> 01:29:57,289
A ship.

1001
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,835
A cup.

1002
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:02,795
<i>A ship.</i>

1003
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:05,423
A speeder.

1004
01:30:13,272 --> 01:30:17,059
- How feel you?
- Cold, sir.

1005
01:30:18,853 --> 01:30:21,389
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1006
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:26,851
- See through you we can.
- Be mindful of your feelings.

1007
01:30:27,019 --> 01:30:29,655
<i>Your thoughts dwell on your mother.</i>

1008
01:30:31,349 --> 01:30:33,701
I miss her.

1009
01:30:34,034 --> 01:30:36,354
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1010
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:38,689
What has that got to do with anything?

1011
01:30:38,898 --> 01:30:41,024
Everything.

1012
01:30:41,592 --> 01:30:44,554
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1013
01:30:44,712 --> 01:30:47,357
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1014
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:50,743
Hate leads to suffering.

1015
01:30:57,433 --> 01:31:00,461
I sense much fear in you.

1016
01:31:13,573 --> 01:31:16,710
Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die?

1017
01:31:16,844 --> 01:31:18,279
I don't know.

1018
01:31:19,188 --> 01:31:21,657
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1019
01:31:23,806 --> 01:31:25,683
I hope not.

1020
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:30,734
Gungans no die'n without a fight.
Wesa warriors.

1021
01:31:30,842 --> 01:31:33,886
Wesa got a grand army.

1022
01:31:34,437 --> 01:31:37,523
<i>Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.</i>

1023
01:31:37,782 --> 01:31:39,784
<i>Your Highness?</i>

1024
01:31:41,651 --> 01:31:43,619
Your Highness...

1025
01:31:43,938 --> 01:31:48,292
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum as supreme chancellor.

1026
01:31:48,473 --> 01:31:52,418
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1027
01:31:52,596 --> 01:31:57,076
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1028
01:31:57,254 --> 01:31:58,714
Who else has been nominated?

1029
01:31:58,853 --> 01:32:02,998
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1030
01:32:03,382 --> 01:32:08,153
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1031
01:32:10,013 --> 01:32:11,906
I will be chancellor.

1032
01:32:12,033 --> 01:32:14,877
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1033
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,046
<i>...there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.</i>

1034
01:32:18,222 --> 01:32:20,157
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1035
01:32:20,266 --> 01:32:23,586
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1036
01:32:25,618 --> 01:32:27,119
Senator...

1037
01:32:27,478 --> 01:32:29,482
...this is your arena.

1038
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:31,833
I feel I must return to mine.

1039
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,066
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1040
01:32:37,157 --> 01:32:38,157
Go back?

1041
01:32:38,224 --> 01:32:41,420
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1042
01:32:41,604 --> 01:32:43,798
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1043
01:32:43,956 --> 01:32:46,693
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1044
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:48,330
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1045
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:50,750
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1046
01:32:50,822 --> 01:32:53,675
Stay here where it's safe.

1047
01:32:54,393 --> 01:32:57,463
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1048
01:32:58,126 --> 01:33:02,597
<i>I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.</i>

1049
01:33:12,113 --> 01:33:14,684
The Force is strong with him.

1050
01:33:14,765 --> 01:33:16,665
He is to be trained, then?

1051
01:33:18,683 --> 01:33:21,018
No, he will not be trained.

1052
01:33:21,502 --> 01:33:22,853
No?

1053
01:33:25,047 --> 01:33:26,941
He is too old.

1054
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:30,920
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1055
01:33:32,223 --> 01:33:35,734
Clouded this boy's future is.

1056
01:33:38,244 --> 01:33:40,121
I will train him, then.

1057
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:46,593
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1058
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:52,396
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.
Impossible to take on a second.

1059
01:33:52,466 --> 01:33:54,135
The code forbids it.

1060
01:33:54,443 --> 01:33:57,638
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1061
01:33:58,064 --> 01:34:01,492
Our own counsel we will
keep on who is ready.

1062
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:06,814
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force, but he is capable.

1063
01:34:07,023 --> 01:34:09,692
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1064
01:34:11,636 --> 01:34:15,364
<i>Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.</i>

1065
01:34:15,705 --> 01:34:18,182
Now is not the time for this.

1066
01:34:18,843 --> 01:34:20,914
<i>The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...</i>

1067
01:34:21,015 --> 01:34:23,415
<i>...and Queen Amidala is returning home...</i>

1068
01:34:23,489 --> 01:34:27,134
...which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1069
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,578
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1070
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:34,338
<i>Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.</i>

1071
01:34:35,368 --> 01:34:39,363
This is the clue we need
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1072
01:34:40,114 --> 01:34:42,408
May the Force be with you.

1073
01:34:55,921 --> 01:34:58,499
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1074
01:34:58,638 --> 01:35:00,409
From your point of view.

1075
01:35:00,487 --> 01:35:03,908
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1076
01:35:04,009 --> 01:35:07,109
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1077
01:35:07,216 --> 01:35:09,461
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1078
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:13,031
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1079
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:21,897
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1080
01:35:22,103 --> 01:35:23,896
You won't be, Ani.

1081
01:35:24,433 --> 01:35:28,662
I'm not allowed to train you,
so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

1082
01:35:28,963 --> 01:35:30,693
Always remember:

1083
01:35:31,694 --> 01:35:34,194
Your focus determines your reality.

1084
01:35:34,582 --> 01:35:37,910
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1085
01:35:38,189 --> 01:35:39,607
Master, sir...

1086
01:35:39,874 --> 01:35:43,219
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1087
01:35:43,347 --> 01:35:46,992
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?

1088
01:35:48,115 --> 01:35:53,353
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form
that resides within all living cells.

1089
01:35:54,428 --> 01:35:57,289
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1090
01:35:57,490 --> 01:36:00,852
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1091
01:36:00,978 --> 01:36:04,899
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1092
01:36:04,999 --> 01:36:07,770
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1093
01:36:07,871 --> 01:36:10,771
...and we would have no
knowledge of the Force.

1094
01:36:10,921 --> 01:36:12,648
They continually speak to us...

1095
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:15,478
...telling us the will of the Force.

1096
01:36:15,876 --> 01:36:20,055
When you learn to quiet your mind,
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1097
01:36:20,214 --> 01:36:21,849
I don't understand.

1098
01:36:22,203 --> 01:36:25,764
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1099
01:36:29,323 --> 01:36:33,260
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1100
01:36:33,811 --> 01:36:35,120
I welcome your help.

1101
01:36:35,329 --> 01:36:39,075
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1102
01:36:39,383 --> 01:36:42,094
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1103
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:45,294
Wesa goin' home!

1104
01:36:45,414 --> 01:36:47,291
Come on, R2.

1105
01:36:57,334 --> 01:36:59,779
<i>Is the planet secure?</i>

1106
01:36:59,971 --> 01:37:03,891
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1107
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:07,011
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1108
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:12,941
<i>Good. I will see to it that in the senate
things stay as they are.</i>

1109
01:37:13,592 --> 01:37:17,079
<i>I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.</i>

1110
01:37:17,238 --> 01:37:18,992
Yes, my lord.

1111
01:37:19,093 --> 01:37:20,993
A Sith here?

1112
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:28,866
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1113
01:37:29,338 --> 01:37:32,058
And those two control the pitch?

1114
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:34,855
You catch on pretty quick.

1115
01:37:35,356 --> 01:37:36,656
<i>As soon as we land...</i>

1116
01:37:36,723 --> 01:37:39,635
<i>...the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.</i>

1117
01:37:39,736 --> 01:37:40,936
<i>I agree.</i>

1118
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:43,464
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1119
01:37:43,998 --> 01:37:46,459
I will take back what's ours.

1120
01:37:46,937 --> 01:37:49,006
<i>There are too few of us,
Your Highness.</i>

1121
01:37:49,145 --> 01:37:51,065
We have no army.

1122
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:52,766
<i>And I can only protect you.</i>

1123
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:54,852
I can't fight a war for you.

1124
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:57,003
Jar Jar Binks.

1125
01:37:57,811 --> 01:37:59,847
Mesa, Your Highness?

1126
01:38:00,264 --> 01:38:03,067
Yes. I need your help.

1127
01:38:08,376 --> 01:38:10,469
I have one battleship on my scope.

1128
01:38:10,905 --> 01:38:12,726
<i>It's a droid control ship.</i>

1129
01:38:12,795 --> 01:38:14,895
<i>They've probably spotted us.</i>

1130
01:38:15,062 --> 01:38:16,689
We haven't much time.

1131
01:38:28,481 --> 01:38:31,268
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1132
01:38:31,389 --> 01:38:32,689
Good.

1133
01:38:32,747 --> 01:38:34,967
Do you think the queen's idea will work?

1134
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:36,918
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1135
01:38:38,839 --> 01:38:41,826
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1136
01:38:44,463 --> 01:38:46,318
I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1137
01:38:46,359 --> 01:38:49,759
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1138
01:38:51,999 --> 01:38:55,528
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1139
01:38:56,337 --> 01:38:58,539
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1140
01:38:59,657 --> 01:39:02,351
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1141
01:39:02,985 --> 01:39:06,080
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1142
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:21,591
Desa nobody dare!

1143
01:39:21,737 --> 01:39:23,865
The Gungan city is deserted!

1144
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:26,554
<i>Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.</i>

1145
01:39:26,876 --> 01:39:29,854
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1146
01:39:30,012 --> 01:39:32,189
More likely they were wiped out.

1147
01:39:32,331 --> 01:39:35,376
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1148
01:39:35,827 --> 01:39:39,171
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1149
01:39:39,297 --> 01:39:42,317
Mesa show you. Come on.
Mesa show you!

1150
01:40:00,421 --> 01:40:04,492
Your Honor,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1151
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:13,931
Heyo dadee Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1152
01:40:14,849 --> 01:40:16,926
Jar Jar Binks.

1153
01:40:17,919 --> 01:40:20,922
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1154
01:40:21,851 --> 01:40:24,094
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1155
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,120
I come before you in peace.

1156
01:40:28,211 --> 01:40:29,922
<i>Naboo biggen.</i>

1157
01:40:30,629 --> 01:40:33,366
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1158
01:40:33,534 --> 01:40:36,937
Yousa all bombad.

1159
01:40:38,064 --> 01:40:40,959
<i>We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.</i>

1160
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:42,410
Your Honor.

1161
01:40:44,779 --> 01:40:47,214
Whosa dis?

1162
01:40:47,865 --> 01:40:50,109
I am Queen Amidala.

1163
01:40:51,494 --> 01:40:57,157
This is my decoy,
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1164
01:40:57,253 --> 01:41:01,465
<i>I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.</i>

1165
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,044
<i>Although we do not always agree,
Your Honor...</i>

1166
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:07,234
...our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1167
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:11,710
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1168
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:15,002
<i>If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.</i>

1169
01:41:15,109 --> 01:41:17,363
I ask you to help us.

1170
01:41:17,504 --> 01:41:20,104
No, I beg you to help us.

1171
01:41:20,314 --> 01:41:22,951
<i>We are your humble servants.</i>

1172
01:41:25,911 --> 01:41:28,731
Our fate is in your hands.

1173
01:41:45,798 --> 01:41:50,486
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1174
01:41:53,072 --> 01:41:56,217
Mesa lika dis!

1175
01:41:57,676 --> 01:42:03,323
Maybe... wesa...
being friends.

1176
01:42:11,799 --> 01:42:13,634
We've sent our patrols.

1177
01:42:14,427 --> 01:42:19,432
We already located their starship
in the swamp. It won't be long, my lord.

1178
01:42:20,061 --> 01:42:24,832
<i>This is an unexpected move for her.
It's too aggressive.</i>

1179
01:42:25,171 --> 01:42:27,848
<i>Lord Maul, be mindful.</i>

1180
01:42:28,036 --> 01:42:30,148
<i>Let them make the first move.</i>

1181
01:42:30,302 --> 01:42:32,302
Yes, my master.

1182
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:37,359
Deysa comin!

1183
01:42:42,424 --> 01:42:43,968
They're here!

1184
01:42:44,326 --> 01:42:45,777
Good. They made it.

1185
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:52,953
Yousa doen grand.

1186
01:42:53,054 --> 01:42:56,154
Jar Jar bring uss-en and da Naboo together.

1187
01:42:56,255 --> 01:42:58,155
Oh, no, no, no.

1188
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:03,725
So, wesa make you...
bombad general.

1189
01:43:03,925 --> 01:43:05,468
General?

1190
01:43:08,365 --> 01:43:09,865
<i>Captain.</i>

1191
01:43:09,966 --> 01:43:12,468
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1192
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:14,497
Almost everyone's in camps.

1193
01:43:14,556 --> 01:43:17,984
A few hundred police and guards have formed
an underground resistance movement.

1194
01:43:18,105 --> 01:43:20,605
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1195
01:43:20,864 --> 01:43:25,685
The Federation army's also much larger
than we thought and much stronger.

1196
01:43:26,732 --> 01:43:29,784
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1197
01:43:30,102 --> 01:43:32,202
The battle is a diversion.

1198
01:43:32,255 --> 01:43:35,027
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1199
01:43:35,385 --> 01:43:36,669
<i>R2.</i>

1200
01:43:37,751 --> 01:43:41,263
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1201
01:43:41,664 --> 01:43:43,164
<i>Once we get to the main entrance...</i>

1202
01:43:43,302 --> 01:43:46,171
<i>...Captain Panaka will create a diversion.</i>

1203
01:43:46,285 --> 01:43:49,405
<i>Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.</i>

1204
01:43:50,164 --> 01:43:52,952
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1205
01:43:53,443 --> 01:43:55,043
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1206
01:43:55,102 --> 01:43:56,979
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1207
01:43:57,212 --> 01:43:59,709
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1208
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:02,250
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1209
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:06,928
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1210
01:44:07,081 --> 01:44:10,251
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1211
01:44:10,434 --> 01:44:13,629
<i>We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.</i>

1212
01:44:13,984 --> 01:44:15,847
We will send what pilots we have...

1213
01:44:15,898 --> 01:44:18,798
...to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1214
01:44:18,901 --> 01:44:22,029
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1215
01:44:22,087 --> 01:44:25,050
<i>The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.</i>

1216
01:44:25,251 --> 01:44:27,051
<i>There's an even bigger danger.</i>

1217
01:44:27,161 --> 01:44:31,432
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness,
he will return with another droid army.

1218
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:34,650
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1219
01:44:34,952 --> 01:44:37,104
Everything depends on it.

1220
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:44,765
<i>She is more foolish than I thought.</i>

1221
01:44:44,793 --> 01:44:49,573
We are sending all troops to meet
this army assembling near the swamp.

1222
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:52,501
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1223
01:44:53,055 --> 01:44:55,324
<i>This will work to our advantage.</i>

1224
01:44:55,384 --> 01:44:58,428
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1225
01:44:59,012 --> 01:45:01,014
<i>Wipe them out.</i>

1226
01:45:02,465 --> 01:45:04,326
<i>All of them.</i>

1227
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,369
Starting up the shield.

1228
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:12,940
Open fire.

1229
01:46:28,956 --> 01:46:32,243
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1230
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:34,979
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1231
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,658
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1232
01:47:04,491 --> 01:47:06,035
This is too close.

1233
01:47:12,015 --> 01:47:13,784
Ani, find cover.

1234
01:47:14,585 --> 01:47:17,037
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1235
01:48:15,446 --> 01:48:16,630
Fighters straight ahead.

1236
01:48:16,841 --> 01:48:18,042
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1237
01:48:18,142 --> 01:48:19,410
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1238
01:48:28,029 --> 01:48:29,164
Cease fire.

1239
01:48:36,947 --> 01:48:39,391
Steady. Steady.

1240
01:49:12,227 --> 01:49:15,272
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1241
01:49:31,994 --> 01:49:33,687
Ouch time.

1242
01:49:48,026 --> 01:49:49,269
Fire!

1243
01:50:11,245 --> 01:50:13,038
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1244
01:50:13,147 --> 01:50:16,358
<i>Red group! Blue group!
Everybody, this way!</i>

1245
01:50:17,121 --> 01:50:18,825
Hey, wait for me!

1246
01:50:18,956 --> 01:50:21,256
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1247
01:50:21,397 --> 01:50:24,000
- But I...
- Stay in that cockpit.

1248
01:50:35,419 --> 01:50:39,047
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1249
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,179
We gotta do something, R2.

1250
01:51:23,676 --> 01:51:26,428
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1251
01:51:31,065 --> 01:51:33,392
Wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1252
01:51:34,271 --> 01:51:36,696
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1253
01:51:45,179 --> 01:51:46,697
Let's go!

1254
01:51:48,110 --> 01:51:50,237
It's on automatic pilot.

1255
01:51:59,165 --> 01:52:01,150
Try to override it.

1256
01:53:01,031 --> 01:53:02,916
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1257
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:11,070
Look, there they are.

1258
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:13,579
<i>That's where the autopilot's taking us.</i>

1259
01:53:30,525 --> 01:53:33,125
Dumb droid. Take that!

1260
01:53:33,166 --> 01:53:35,366
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1261
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:49,061
The deflector shield is too strong.

1262
01:53:58,122 --> 01:53:59,848
This is tense!

1263
01:54:02,165 --> 01:54:06,186
R2, get us off this autopilot.
It's gonna get us both killed.

1264
01:54:08,199 --> 01:54:09,708
<i>You did it, R2!</i>

1265
01:54:10,459 --> 01:54:11,902
OK, let's go left.

1266
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:18,055
<i>Go back?</i>

1267
01:54:18,135 --> 01:54:22,348
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1268
01:54:29,375 --> 01:54:31,810
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1269
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:39,783
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1270
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:54,418
Ascension guns!

1271
01:57:00,610 --> 01:57:02,495
Retreat! Retreat!

1272
01:57:04,019 --> 01:57:05,470
Dis is nutsen.

1273
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:17,801
Big boomers.

1274
01:57:38,402 --> 01:57:40,002
Give me a lift!

1275
01:57:47,962 --> 01:57:51,582
- Jar Jar, usen da booma!
- What? Mesa no have a booma!

1276
01:57:51,722 --> 01:57:53,732
Here. Taken dis one.

1277
01:58:10,168 --> 01:58:11,368
Jar Jar!

1278
01:58:11,509 --> 01:58:13,927
Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1279
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:26,331
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1280
01:58:39,078 --> 01:58:41,171
We're hit, R2!

1281
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:57,287
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1282
01:59:04,662 --> 01:59:06,806
Everything's overheated.

1283
01:59:08,298 --> 01:59:09,732
This is not good.

1284
02:00:22,206 --> 02:00:26,643
No giben up, General Jar Jar.
Mesa think of something.

1285
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,031
Hands up.

1286
02:00:28,090 --> 02:00:30,843
My give up. My give up.

1287
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:42,635
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1288
02:00:42,693 --> 02:00:46,714
<i>Time for you to sign the treaty
and end this pointless debate in the senate.</i>

1289
02:00:46,815 --> 02:00:48,415
<i>Viceroy!</i>

1290
02:00:48,624 --> 02:00:50,643
Your occupation here has ended.

1291
02:00:52,203 --> 02:00:55,714
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1292
02:01:02,046 --> 02:01:03,589
<i>Captain!</i>

1293
02:01:12,915 --> 02:01:14,791
Jam the doors.

1294
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:21,236
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1295
02:02:24,450 --> 02:02:27,069
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1296
02:02:30,142 --> 02:02:31,427
Take this!

1297
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:34,563
And this!

1298
02:02:43,031 --> 02:02:44,031
We're losing power.

1299
02:02:44,102 --> 02:02:46,055
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1300
02:02:46,096 --> 02:02:47,396
<i>Impossible!</i>

1301
02:02:47,653 --> 02:02:49,540
Nothing can get through our shield.

1302
02:02:50,823 --> 02:02:52,499
Let's get outta here.

1303
02:03:00,831 --> 02:03:03,659
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1304
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:07,946
We didn't hit it.

1305
02:03:10,881 --> 02:03:13,141
Now, this is Podracing.

1306
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,230
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1307
02:03:39,862 --> 02:03:41,422
Was'n they doing?

1308
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:45,184
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1309
02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:49,096
They all broke-ed.

1310
02:04:38,596 --> 02:04:41,057
No, it's too late.

1311
02:04:41,336 --> 02:04:43,705
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1312
02:04:45,016 --> 02:04:46,616
Promise...

1313
02:04:47,079 --> 02:04:49,349
Promise me...
you will train the boy.

1314
02:04:49,585 --> 02:04:51,011
Yes, Master.

1315
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:57,581
He... is the chosen one.

1316
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:01,148
He... will bring balance.

1317
02:05:02,495 --> 02:05:03,989
Train him.

1318
02:05:31,202 --> 02:05:32,970
Now, Viceroy...

1319
02:05:33,264 --> 02:05:36,542
<i>...you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.</i>

1320
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:41,669
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise good-bye.

1321
02:05:55,511 --> 02:05:58,881
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1322
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,359
And you, young Skywalker.

1323
02:06:01,691 --> 02:06:04,712
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1324
02:06:11,514 --> 02:06:13,991
Congratulations on your
election, Chancellor.

1325
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:19,416
Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty.
It's you who should be congratulated.

1326
02:06:19,456 --> 02:06:24,109
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1327
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:33,804
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1328
02:06:34,095 --> 02:06:38,491
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1329
02:06:38,591 --> 02:06:40,369
...I do not.

1330
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:42,520
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1331
02:06:45,606 --> 02:06:48,209
The chosen one the boy may be.

1332
02:06:48,417 --> 02:06:49,913
Nevertheless...

1333
02:06:50,014 --> 02:06:53,214
...grave danger I fear in his training.

1334
02:06:53,352 --> 02:06:57,197
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1335
02:06:57,343 --> 02:06:59,470
I will train Anakin.

1336
02:07:01,492 --> 02:07:03,811
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1337
02:07:03,949 --> 02:07:08,646
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.
Need that you do not.

1338
02:07:10,894 --> 02:07:13,839
Agree with you the council does.

1339
02:07:15,184 --> 02:07:18,804
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1340
02:07:46,183 --> 02:07:47,927
What will happen to me now?

1341
02:07:48,181 --> 02:07:51,237
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1342
02:07:51,395 --> 02:07:54,695
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1343
02:08:04,076 --> 02:08:07,496
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1344
02:08:07,655 --> 02:08:10,084
Always two there are.

1345
02:08:10,265 --> 02:08:13,365
No more, no less.

1346
02:08:13,577 --> 02:08:16,555
A master and an apprentice.

1347
02:08:16,684 --> 02:08:21,121
But which was destroyed?
The master or the apprentice?

1348
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,651
Peace!

1349
02:09:37,305 --> 02:10:37,217
