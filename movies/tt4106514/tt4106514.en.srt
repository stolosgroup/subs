1
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,588
The owner of the flat discovered
them late Wednesday night.

2
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,275
It's him.

3
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,569
Yeah.

4
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,073
<i> The owner of the flat</i>

5
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,676
<i>discovered them
late Wednesday night.</i>

6
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,664
Come on,
it's gonna go.

7
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,521
- It's a really good one.
- Sylvia!

8
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,905
So loud in there.

9
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,742
Are these free?

10
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,777
They're all yours.

11
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,984
Football fans on trains
are the worst.

12
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,655
Yeah.
I'm Pieter.

13
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,590
I'm Mac.

14
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,392
And this is Sylvia.

15
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:56,762
On a tight budget, huh?

16
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:58,930
Scrapbook.

17
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,804
Nice tats, man.

18
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:07,939
Thanks.

19
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,676
I'm almost done
with both sleeves.

20
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,879
Like a living canvas.

21
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,647
They're beautiful.

22
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,450
My wife appreciates art.

23
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,827
Oh, Jesus!
Thank you.

24
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,708
Get up.

25
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:32,964
I've been
trying to call you.

26
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:35,901
I want to see Kimberly.

27
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,917
Hey, what time is it?

28
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,453
9:00.
You look like shit.

29
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,976
Oh, fuck.

30
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,112
Oh, I feel like shit.

31
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,615
Get ready, I'll
order you something to eat.

32
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,997
Oh, okay. God damn it,
I'm not hungry. Stop.

33
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,355
Fine. I won't get you
anything to eat.

34
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,990
Fuck. Valerie.

35
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,729
Get off! No!

36
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,665
It doesn't help.

37
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,603
I need to see her.

38
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,007
You shouldn't.

39
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,677
Okay?
Just trust me.

40
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,614
Then I want to see
where it happened.

41
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,058
Give me a minute.

42
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,939
This is highly
unconventional.

43
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,386
I don't give a damn.

44
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,653
I want to see it.

45
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,444
Just cut the tape.

46
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,780
It is still
a crime scene.

47
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,427
Yeah. I've been
a cop for 30 years.

48
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,050
I know how to
walk through a crime scene.

49
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:04,934
Okay.

50
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,059
I'm afraid you'll have
to wait downstairs.

51
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,530
We have dusted
for prints, but...

52
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,065
It's been rented
by hundreds of people.

53
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,948
You've questioned everyone
in these buildings?

54
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,038
Yes.

55
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,774
No one saw
or heard anything.

56
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,610
There were two
glasses in the sink,

57
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,212
only the victims' prints.

58
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,659
No one saw anything,
no one heard anything,

59
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,116
and there was
no forced entry...

60
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,618
My daughter
knew the killer.

61
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,522
She's a cop's kid, she would
never let some stranger in.

62
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,669
We need to check
their credit cards,

63
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,205
social media, everything.
Find out where they were.

64
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,562
It's all in motion.

65
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,198
Where's the blood?

66
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,601
Their blood
was completely drained.

67
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,848
<i>The victims
were on the bed.</i>

68
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,474
<i>The male victim's eyes
were held open with pins.</i>

69
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,676
<i>His lips had something
attached to them.</i>

70
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,546
<i>The female victim
was in his arms.</i>

71
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,794
The arms were severed
below the elbow.

72
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,887
The left upper arm was inserted
into the male victim's mouth.

73
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,525
Why do you think
he posed them?

74
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,173
Because he's extremely sick,
I'd imagine.

75
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,564
But he was
saying something.

76
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:21,978
A highly organised crime scene

77
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:31,054
like this is done for a
specific reason.

78
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,144
The couple that was
murdered in Madrid,

79
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,960
are there similarities?

80
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,027
A few.

81
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,662
Were they staged, Inspector?

82
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,763
I can't say.

83
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,499
At this stage, it's not clear

84
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,267
whether or not
these are isolated incidents.

85
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,993
We both know this is not
the MO of a random killer.

86
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,864
America's
an arrogant country.

87
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,866
I hope
I don't offend you.

88
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,635
No.

89
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,303
Where are you headed
actually, man?

90
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,006
Working my way north.

91
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,552
You?

92
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,709
Erm...
Same. No real plans.

93
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,547
We should all
hang out together.

94
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,016
Pick a place
to get off.

95
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,252
Come on,
it'll be fun.

96
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,287
Venture into
the unknown.

97
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,761
Let's get some drinks and then
we can discuss it. Vodka?

98
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,195
What else?

99
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,215
I can't believe you almost
invited him to come with us.

100
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,684
I just didn't think,
okay? I'm sorry.

101
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,219
Hmm.

102
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,988
Like obviously, I'd much rather
spend every second with you.

103
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,612
You only.
Hmm.

104
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,125
I just thought he was
a bit strange,

105
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,748
didn't you, Mr
Randolph?

106
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,586
You know what?
I did, Mrs Randolph.

107
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,196
You remember
when she was eight...

108
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,066
Karate class?

109
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,036
She loved that class.

110
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,773
Hmm. You mean
she loved making you proud.

111
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,312
You couldn't just

112
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,993
let them go to Hawaii

113
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,861
or the Caribbean
for their honeymoon?

114
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:19,985
No...

115
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,198
You had to be the hero,

116
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,789
buy her
the big Euro adventure.

117
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,770
That's one of the reasons
it didn't work out,

118
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,662
you always had to be
the one she loved the most.

119
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,037
Why did you have to
send her here? Hmm?

120
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,641
Why?

121
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,143
Why did you have to
send her here?

122
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,391
Why? Why!

123
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,860
I just... I feel like

124
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:55,632
I'm going crazy.

125
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,921
I'm so sorry.

126
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,825
How did this
happen to us?

127
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,834
One bottle of vodka,
and three cups...

128
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,175
I guess one cup then.

129
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,013
I...

130
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,182
I feel like
I'm abandoning her.

131
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,018
No. You're not.

132
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,222
I'm here, okay?

133
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,057
This is what I do.

134
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,942
You'll...

135
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,734
You'll let me know everything,
right, no matter what?

136
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:17,936
Of course I will.

137
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,140
No, you won't.

138
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,377
I heard
everything, Jacob.

139
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,149
Someone mutilated
our daughter.

140
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,019
Find him.

141
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,121
<i>Over two weeks
after the gruesome murder</i>

142
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,956
<i>of a young American couple,</i>

147
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,465
Sir.

148
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,016
Get your
hands off me.

149
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,590
Give me half an hour, I'll...
I'll call you back, thanks.

150
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,597
Would you get
Mr Kanon a coffee?

151
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,503
Sorry about that.

152
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,139
I'm sure he's just
trying to do his job.

153
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,420
Yeah.

154
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,578
Well, we're all trying to do
that. Why don't you take a seat?

155
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,120
It's been over two goddamn weeks
since my daughter's murder.

156
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,718
You've been
avoiding me,

157
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:54,237
and I know that
you have new leads.

158
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,638
Absolutely, we do,

159
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,241
but nothing I can share with a
member of the public,

160
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,877
however close they are
to the case.

161
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,166
How about
a fellow cop?

162
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,648
This postcard that I
hear about on the news,

163
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,484
when I should be hearing from
you... What does it say?

164
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,142
You know
I can't tell you that.

165
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,361
Is that it? Is that what
you're gonna tell me?

166
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,550
That's everything.

167
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,901
Okay.

168
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:29,027
The questions that I have
that need to be answered?

169
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,963
I will find
the answers myself.

170
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,199
I don't recommend
you do that.

171
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,068
You had
your chance.

172
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:08,132
<i>Floor
minus three. Doors open.</i>

173
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,294
Hey.
Hi, can I help you?

174
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,408
I'm waiting
for him actually.

175
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,298
Me?
Charles Hardwick?

176
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,734
You received
a postcard, right?

177
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,514
You're on
private property.

178
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,565
My daughter is dead.

179
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,639
And you received a postcard from
the person that killed her.

180
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,742
I'm not at liberty
to talk about this.

181
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,789
Look, sir,
all I wanna know is

182
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,347
if anyone in Madrid
received a postcard?

183
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,550
Do you have kids?

184
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,554
It's okay,
I'm good.

185
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,519
I've been told that it's

186
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,238
breaking the law if I discuss
the details.

187
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,661
How many kids
do you have?

188
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,632
One... Baby girl.

189
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:52,670
There is nothing more special
to a father than a daughter.

190
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,377
A Spanish reporter

191
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,312
got a postcard
of the Prado.

192
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,217
The victims,

193
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,454
apparently,
they had their lips...

194
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,690
Severed.

195
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,873
I'm sorry,
that was our last flight.

196
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,220
We have one leaving
tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.

197
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,778
Yup, you have told me
this now numerous times.

198
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,482
Listen to me.
This is a police matter.

199
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,751
An emergency. You have
to get me on a plane.

200
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,522
Sir, please, I've told you
that was our last flight.

201
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,291
I know. It's your job to
be helpful, right?

202
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,171
Be helpful.

203
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,307
Do me a favour,
and get on your computer

204
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,875
and find me
a connecting flight.

205
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,344
I don't even care
where it connects from,

206
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,769
I just can't have it be
tomorrow. I need it to be now.

207
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,650
All other flights
are full. I'm sorry.

208
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,853
I need
to get to Madrid.

209
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,655
What part of that
do you not understand?

210
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,524
Sir, you need
to calm down.

211
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,816
I am calm! Can someone
just get me a fucking flight?

212
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,719
Is everything
okay, madam?

213
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,016
Perfect.

214
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,323
Sir, you
need to come with us.

215
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,359
Yeah.

216
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,162
Thank you
for your help.

217
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,247
Hi there. Can I see
your passport?

218
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:31,869
Yup.

219
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,805
Torturing yourself,
Detective.

220
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,444
I do understand
how hard this is.

221
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:41,779
Really?

222
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,748
Do you?

223
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,319
See, I don't think you have
any idea how hard this is.

224
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,957
Go home
and mourn, sir.

225
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,926
"Go home"?

226
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,464
I'm not going anywhere
without my little girl.

227
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,713
I am sympathetic, Mr
Kanon, I assure you...

228
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,604
"Detective Kanon".

229
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,134
It's Detective Kanon.

230
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:10,708
And the last thing I want is
your sympathy.

231
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,587
Your daughter's
personal belongings.

232
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,259
Now please, think
about what I said.

233
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,387
<i>Reports suggest the couple were</i>

234
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,088
<i>backpacking through Europe.</i>

235
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,790
<i>They had been staying
at the Cathedral youth hostel</i>

236
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,875
<i>in Munich for a week.</i>

237
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,961
<i>Early speculation indicates
that this is the third</i>

238
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,963
<i>in a series of brutal murders.</i>

239
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,030
Hey!

240
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:24,802
Detective Kanon.

241
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,449
There's still
a restaurant in Munich

242
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,874
where you can drink a cup of
coffee and smoke a cigarette.

243
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,143
You look like
you could use both.

244
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,619
This must be
a very painful time.

245
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,993
Did you find
her hands?

246
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,463
No.

247
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,468
But there were...

248
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:04,108
There were body parts
that didn't belong?

249
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,129
<i> Let me guess,</i>

250
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,132
<i>there were no liquor
bottles at the scene,</i>

251
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,866
<i>but the victims,</i>

252
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,602
<i>they had high levels
of alcohol in their system.</i>

253
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,992
<i>They were
probably drugged.</i>

254
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,010
We found traces
of cyclopentolate.

255
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,733
It's an agent
in eye drops.

256
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:34,839
And they were a young...
A young, married couple?

257
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,677
Crazy people often obsess
about youth and beauty.

258
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,090
But they don't all
mutilate their victims.

259
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,883
This bastard, he's very
selective about his targets.

260
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,863
Certainly his actions

261
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,687
don't fit
with existing profiles.

262
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,258
The postcard,
then the photograph.

263
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,194
What photograph?

264
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,642
I wish
I could tell you.

265
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,566
Is there a photograph
of my daughter?

266
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,002
Yes.

267
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,637
Is she alive?

268
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,675
I need to see it.

269
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,858
It's already been
marked as evidence.

270
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,615
It's part of
the London investigation.

271
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,217
I'm sorry.

272
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:36,000
The eyes. They don't
belong to the victims.

273
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,238
Jesus!

274
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,793
Detective Kanon, now
I have someone to question.

275
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,102
You're wasting
your time.

276
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,238
He's moved on.

277
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,076
Ms Lombard,

278
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,850
you are now part of
an ongoing investigation.

279
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,219
It is a criminal offense to
reveal what is on the postcard.

280
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,121
Understand?

281
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,168
Each day your mail
will be opened

282
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,136
by a police officer,
morning and afternoon,

283
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,259
starting tomorrow.

284
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,295
Okay.
Okay?

285
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:23,085
<i>Police
sources have confirmed</i>

286
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,387
<i>that an American journalist
living in Stockholm,</i>

287
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,044
<i>received a postcard
this morning.</i>

288
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:47,175
Good night,
Ms Lombard.

289
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,132
Night.

290
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,239
Ms Lombard.

291
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,152
What?
What do you want?

292
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,553
My name is Detective Kanon,

293
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,955
and I just want to ask you
about the postcard.

294
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,012
If you're a detective,
talk to the detectives.

295
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,026
Please, they're gonna
send you something else,

296
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,850
and by then,
they'll be dead!

297
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,955
Please, I just
want to help.

298
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,263
I'm leaving you
my card.

299
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,960
Er...
Well...

300
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,329
Well, maybe it's fate,
running into him twice.

301
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,399
Well, he's seen us now. So,
we don't have much choice.

302
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,170
Hey, man. How bizarre
bumping into you!

303
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,172
And you thought
you'd ditched me.

304
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,386
No, God, we just... We got
off the train last minute.

305
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,977
You were at the bar.
So... We left a note.

306
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,079
No note.

307
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,994
Mac, I assumed
that you...

308
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,184
No, I left it
to you.

309
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:24,188
You Americans
crack me up.

310
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,857
Come, let's go for drink,
life's for the living.

311
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,062
So, er, how long have you
been here for, man?

312
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,531
A couple of days.

313
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,433
Yeah? Us too.
Where are you staying?

314
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,604
By the, er...
Stortorget.

315
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:43,919
You?

316
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,909
Oh... Just a place
back there.

317
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,445
The Six, fancy.

318
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:51,582
How do you know that?

319
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,385
I'm stalking you.

320
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,369
Ah, the bag.

321
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,300
The first murders
were eight days apart.

322
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:46,147
Munich was exactly
16 days after London.

323
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,549
It could be a pattern.

324
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,484
Which means there are
undiscovered victims out there.

325
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,575
We're working closely
with the joint task force.

326
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,655
This is a Europe-wide
investigation.

327
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,523
You do understand that this
would explain

328
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,392
why my daughter's hands are
still missing.

329
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,326
Detective Kanon...

330
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,144
Did you hear
what I just said?

331
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,963
All our units have been
provided with the profile.

332
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,965
Your profile
is wrong.

333
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:07,068
Look, this killer's brand
of murder is very specific,

334
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,603
extremely hard
to profile.

335
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,339
People like him can be
charming, dynamic.

336
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,941
I have worked
cases that are...

337
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,498
I'm sure you are
a hotshot detective,

338
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:18,068
but we don't conduct ourselves
like the American police.

339
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,581
What the fuck
does that mean?

340
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,604
Shoot
first, ask questions later.

341
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,976
I don't give a rat's ass
what either of you think.

342
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,556
You've got exactly four
days to prevent a murder.

343
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,293
It's not personal. I do
sympathise, of course,

344
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,460
but your
objectivity has...

345
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,228
Fuck!

346
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:46,690
Tilda, I have a human interest
piece on the killings.

347
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,692
No.
Wait, please.

348
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:50,921
I...

349
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:51,673
The reporter
I interned for in Chicago,

350
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,030
he did a similar piece

351
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,065
and it out-sold
everything that year.

352
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,736
So, you found it okay?

353
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,649
Yeah.

354
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,184
People are helpful and thank God

355
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,388
they speak a little
bit of English.

356
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,779
Why didn't you tell me about
your daughter last night?

357
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,449
Because it's hard.

358
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,218
It's not something
I want to open with.

359
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,723
What do you
want from me?

360
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,427
I want to know what
was on the postcard.

361
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:28,065
What do you
want from me?

362
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,345
I've been thrown into this mess,

363
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:33,181
and nobody is telling
me anything.

364
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,639
Look, I write
a weekly piece

365
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,685
at a newspaper about
being an American

366
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,155
living in a strange
country.

367
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,222
Why would
something like this

368
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,379
happen to
someone like me?

369
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,417
I'm sorry, I know it's
hard being on the outside.

370
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,588
And I feel like that too,
and... And I want to help.

371
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:15,212
So, I, erm... I contacted
this Spanish journalist

372
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,148
and that guy Hardwick
from<i> The Guardian.</i>

373
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:21,351
But you know, it doesn't
make much sense.

374
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,753
I mean,
there seems to be

375
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:27,357
no connection between
what we do as journalists.

376
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,793
You know,
one covers politics,

377
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,629
one covers finance,
one culture.

378
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,264
And the postcards?

379
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,867
Well, what do
we have?

380
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,169
In Madrid, it said,

381
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,715
"Till death
do us part."

382
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:43,640
In London,
"Watch the innocent die,"

383
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:47,144
in Munich it said,
"Feel the pain, see the truth."

384
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,247
And here,
"Love will never die."

385
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:54,451
And every sentence is always
followed by an ellipsis.

386
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:55,897
"Dot, dot, dot".

387
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,554
A continuation.
Yeah.

388
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:01,391
He announces his arrival in
a city with the postcard.

389
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:03,627
Selects a couple...

390
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,564
Young, newly married,
happy...

391
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,839
You like herring?

392
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,310
It's the worst decision
I've ever made.

393
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,413
I was trying
to be polite.

394
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,450
Why did he say
she wasn't with him?

395
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:29,719
They're very
independent people.

396
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,322
She likes to fly,
and he likes trains.

397
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:34,524
Here he comes.

398
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:37,772
Mac, Sylvia,

399
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:41,498
meet my wife and the artist
behind my tattoos, Nienke.

400
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,444
It's a pleasure
meeting you both.

401
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,313
He kept your
existence very quiet.

402
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:46,748
Well, in my
husband's defence,

403
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,316
it sounds as if
you two ditched him

404
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,817
before he could
reveal very much.

405
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:53,476
Touche.

406
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,312
Would you like
another drink?

407
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:56,846
Maybe
something stronger?

408
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,194
Yes, we would.

409
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,194
Yeah.

410
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,194
Absolutely.

411
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,217
Okay, let's go.
Tequila!

412
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,471
Have you guys
been to Bjorkskar yet?

413
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,739
Is that the island?
Yes.

414
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,330
Part of the archipelago.

415
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,298
This time of year,
it's really something.

416
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,944
Desolate, moody.

417
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,468
It's just a short ferry
ride. You should come.

418
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:21,542
The finger in the
wound I recognise,

419
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,366
but the woman's hand...

420
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,503
No.

421
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,848
<i>The Incredulity
of Saint Thomas.</i>

422
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,597
It has been depicted
by many artists.

423
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:43,787
This is by Caravaggio.

424
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:45,767
Thomas the Apostle,

425
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,558
skeptical of Jesus'
resurrection.

426
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,672
You see here,

427
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:53,063
he is testing the wound
to see if it bleeds.

428
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,743
"Unless I see the nail marks
in his hands"

429
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,979
"and put
my hand into his side,"

430
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,703
"I will not believe it."

431
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,838
Hence the phrase,
"Doubting Thomas."

432
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:05,520
<i>Saturn Devouring His Son,</i>

433
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,089
by Francisco Goya,
exhibited in London.

434
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:09,713
Postcard said,

435
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,082
"Watch the
innocent die."

436
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,119
This,<i> The Incredulity</i>
<i>of St Thomas,</i>

437
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,922
on display, right there
in that building.

438
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,895
Why didn't you bring this to
the Stockholm task force?

439
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,431
Because they're
by the book,

440
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,133
and you seem...

441
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:33,636
You seem open
to possibilities.

442
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:42,746
Whoa, stop.

443
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:46,744
I've seen him before.

444
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:47,729
This woman is
moving off with him.

445
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:48,796
That's not a "him."

446
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,132
It's a "them."

447
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:52,889
Go back,
to the day before.

448
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:56,760
Stop.
There they are.

449
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,163
Come on.

450
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,400
Pick up
your goddamn head!

451
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:36,666
Forty-odd cameras and not one
of them picked up their faces!

452
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,637
Seriously, you must
take it easy on yourself.

453
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,440
You've gotten us somewhere,
and that's a good thing.

454
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,559
Detective Hoglund promised me

455
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:54,429
she will include you in all
intelligence going forward.

456
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:55,985
Big fucking deal.

457
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:58,822
Tomorrow, at this time,
another couple will be dead.

458
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:02,770
Look, have them
cross-reference passports.

459
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,908
Any couples that have been to
Madrid, London, Stockholm, here,

460
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,910
it can't be that hard
to find them.

461
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:12,702
The European Union operates a
freedom of movement agreement.

462
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,104
We still
have porous borders.

463
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,852
Are you telling me
there's no fool-proof way

464
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:20,009
of registering people's
comings and goings?

465
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,912
With terrorism
and the refugee crisis,

466
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:26,516
some countries have reinstated
temporary controls.

467
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,651
But generally
speaking, no.

468
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,756
You have to let me
see all the files.

469
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,237
You want me to retire
immediately, huh?

470
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:37,660
No, I don't.

471
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,663
I want to
help you catch them.

472
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:20,603
Sylvia?

473
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,773
Did you lose
a little thing?

474
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:26,009
That's my hat.
Where did you get it?

475
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:27,977
It's your
so-called note.

476
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,180
Give it to me.
Yeah.

477
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,733
You weirdo.

478
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:41,024
You know what?
A gift.

479
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:45,795
You're not gonna
get it back though.

480
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:48,598
Going to keep it.

481
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:00,021
<i>Twenty-six, and
twenty-three. They're Dutch.</i>

482
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,289
He gave
his passport information

483
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:03,157
to rent an apartment
on Kindstugatan.

484
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:04,314
According to the owner,

485
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,683
they arrived
separately from Germany.

486
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:11,098
At the airport,
we have evidence

487
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,156
she changed sterling
into Swedish krona.

488
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:16,292
He has two recorded offences
for drug possession.

489
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:19,941
She works at
a tattoo parlour,

490
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,865
and has spent two years at
the Gerrit Rietveld Academie.

491
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,278
What's that?

492
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:25,635
It's an art school.

493
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,226
Welcome.
We got jobs to do.

494
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,634
The owner says they
haven't been here all day.

495
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,341
This hat...

496
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,913
It's Kimberly's.

497
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,049
Detective
Kanon, I'm so sorry.

498
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,194
The ears...

499
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:34,297
They're from
the Munich murders.

500
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,066
Yeah, you may be right.

501
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:39,335
Somewhere, there are
undiscovered victims.

502
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,939
This is
Antonio Canova,

503
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:45,775
<i>Psyche Revived
by Cupid's Kiss.</i>

504
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,889
Let me guess,
exhibited at...

505
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,313
Here in the National
museum in Stockholm.

506
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:55,985
And it represents Cupid
waking Psyche's lifeless corpse,

507
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:58,955
<i>and reuniting
the torn apart lovers.</i>

508
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:01,324
"Love will never die."

509
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:03,526
Hmm.

510
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:06,874
So do you think that the ears

511
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:09,744
are supposed to
represent the wings?

512
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,000
I guess so.

513
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,469
I also think that...

514
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:16,506
Madrid is a sculpture.

515
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:18,541
This one,
Rodin's<i> The Kiss.</i>

516
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,278
I mean,
look at the lips.

517
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:25,982
They don't actually touch, like
they were interrupted...

518
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,951
"Till death do us part."

519
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,420
Yeah.

520
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:38,361
Messages
on the postcards...

521
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:41,964
Death, pain, I...

522
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:44,867
I get it, but...

523
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:47,537
- But love?
- I just...

524
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,473
I don't understand
what they're trying to say.

525
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:55,389
Er, that love
is deadly,

526
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,947
that love is painful?

527
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,082
I...

528
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,187
I think they're trying
to destroy joy.

529
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:08,591
I'm... I'm sorry. I...

530
00:47:10,028 --> 00:47:11,427
I forgot
for a moment.

531
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:15,097
It's okay.

532
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:20,002
I just want
to bring her home.

533
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:25,408
I fell asleep, God knows
how. I feel like...

534
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,288
I haven't
slept in weeks.

535
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:30,223
<i>I get dressed
and go to the office,</i>

536
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,181
<i>just so that I don't
sit at home feeling useless.</i>

537
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:37,565
I think that "useless" is

538
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:41,402
exactly how we're
supposed to feel.

539
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:44,104
Hey, I got to go.
I will keep you posted.

540
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:45,194
I promise, okay?

541
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:54,615
Okay, see, this is footage from
a storefront security camera,

542
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,539
one block away
from the ferry terminal.

543
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:58,574
So, we slowed it down
and had it enhanced.

544
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,083
Have you got the keys?
No, you have the keys.

545
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:08,517
I have a key.

546
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,564
Erm, hi, we are checking
out of room 418.

547
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,100
Let me get
your bill ready.

548
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:26,981
Mr and Mrs Randolph.

549
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,137
Mmm-hmm.

550
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,240
"Mr and Mrs Randolph."

551
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:32,987
I love
the sound of that.

552
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,377
Hmm?

553
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:50,070
Police! Police!

554
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,193
What is going on?

555
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:54,597
Can you tell us
what's happening?

556
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,501
Can somebody please tell
me what's going on?

557
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:04,373
Can you tell us
who they are?

558
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:07,310
Yeah, that's Pieter
and Nienke, from Amsterdam.

559
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:09,290
Wait, why?
Did they do something?

560
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:10,579
Is that why
you brought us here?

561
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,485
Fuck!
Jesus Christ!

562
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,167
You took a ferry with
them to Bjorkskar.

563
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:27,430
That happened there?

564
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:28,698
You were with them?

565
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:32,268
We have you
on surveillance footage.

566
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:37,952
Yeah. Yeah, we were with them.
We... We took a ferry,

567
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:40,120
we planned to
explore and stay over.

568
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,144
But then Mac wasn't
feeling well, so we left.

569
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,024
So you left
on the next ferry?

570
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:45,659
There's something about being
sick in a foreign country,

571
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,750
you know, it's like,
double worse.

572
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,064
You just want to be at
home in your own bed,

573
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:51,465
eating room service.

574
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,500
We went back
to the hotel.

575
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,536
<i>I had chicken soup
and I barely touched it,</i>

576
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,394
<i>and Sylvia had
burger and fries.</i>

577
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:01,063
Yeah, we got the ferry back.
I have a receipt.

578
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:03,510
Mac always makes fun of me

579
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,479
because I save everything for a
memory book.

580
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,403
I can show you.
It's with my things.

581
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:09,205
We will check.

582
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:12,675
She seems
genuinely distressed.

583
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:15,011
I agree.
He seems unsettled.

584
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,645
Should just
play along,

585
00:50:17,749 --> 00:50:19,382
empathise with her.

586
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,450
She is
a clever girl.

587
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,665
I can see
her wheels turning.

588
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:27,568
I wonder,
how you liked Madrid?

589
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:30,459
Madrid?
I don't understand.

590
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:32,506
Are we
making you nervous?

591
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,231
Well, I mean, yeah. You know,
I've seen these movies.

592
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,127
<i>You know,</i>

593
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:38,579
<i>Americans thrown in jail
in a foreign country</i>

594
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:39,780
<i>for something they didn't do.</i>

595
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:41,615
There's no way these kids
are responsible for

596
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,250
what I saw five weeks ago.

597
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:44,807
No. I've never even
been to Spain.

598
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:49,045
Look, we landed in Rome.
We spent a while there,

599
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:51,747
then we got a train to Paris
and rented a little apartment.

600
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:54,116
Do we have proof
they were in Paris?

601
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:57,686
Anyone can rent an apartment
and not stay in it.

602
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,388
He's right.

603
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,135
What was
that, Pierce?

604
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,391
He said you're right.

605
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,470
Ask her
about the details.

606
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:04,371
Yes.

607
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,241
Ask her about the details.
Make her be specific.

608
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:09,209
We ate at the same
restaurant every day,

609
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,577
Le Comptoir.

610
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,668
If you get me my bag,
I can show you the receipts.

611
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,349
<i>Like I said, I'm a
bit of a collector.</i>

612
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:16,605
<i>Yeah,
we'll have it checked.</i>

613
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:18,641
She is lying.

614
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:20,521
Perhaps...
No.

615
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:22,778
She's too polished,
it's rehearsed.

616
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:25,347
You've got to push her
harder, trip her up.

617
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:27,394
Let me in there.

618
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,596
Detective Kanon, please,
we have a process.

619
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,120
Your process sucks!

620
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,225
So where did you
travel to from Paris?

621
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:38,138
Luxembourg,

622
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:40,663
which I did not expect
to like, but we did.

623
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:44,144
The exhibits, the
museums, Notre-Dame...

624
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:45,813
Not the
Notre-Dame,

625
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,514
<i>but, beautiful.</i>

626
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:50,084
It is possible, I mean,
maybe it is not them.

627
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:52,386
No. They would have you
believing that up is down,

628
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,421
that black is white.

629
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:55,544
That girl...

630
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,281
That girl,

631
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:03,719
she killed
my daughter.

632
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,496
I will stake
my life on it.

633
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:17,800
<i>Show me receipts
from the museums you visited.</i>

634
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:19,869
I'm really tired.

635
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:21,871
Please,
have a look.

636
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:24,573
Okay.

637
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,181
I love museums.

638
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,553
See?

639
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:40,222
Forum d'art
in Luxembourg.

640
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:41,735
I still don't know
how any of this

641
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,559
is relevant to what
happened.

642
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:45,794
<i>Hey, I am really trying
to be helpful here,</i>

643
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:48,531
<i>but can we
please go now?</i>

644
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:49,865
Once again,

645
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,735
you arrived to London.
And then?

646
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:55,771
From London,
back to Luxembourg,

647
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,552
then Czech Republic,
and now we're here.

648
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:00,442
And everywhere you went,
you paid with cash?

649
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:02,945
You must admit
that's not common.

650
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:05,481
Do you know what credit card
companies charge in fees?

651
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,561
<i>It's the only way to travel and
not come back</i>

652
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:08,829
<i>to a mound of debt.</i>

653
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:11,287
A prepared answer
for everything!

654
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,200
<i>Each of us lost
our parents young</i>

655
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:15,257
<i>and we both got
a small inheritance.</i>

656
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:17,526
<i>Being alone
in this world,</i>

657
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,361
<i>it's made us
very, very close.</i>

658
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,363
Can we go now?

659
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,764
Everything
they say checks out.

660
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:50,993
Sylvia and Mac Randolph, 22
and 19, reside in Los Angeles.

661
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,907
They have proof
of being in places far away

662
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,809
from when and where
the crimes took place.

663
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,378
They could've stopped in Paris
on their way from Madrid.

664
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,479
But we can't
prove it.

665
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:01,515
Well, hold them
until we can.

666
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,906
But why would they go to London,
where passports are required,

667
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:05,686
or book a hotel
like the Six,

668
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,287
if they're trying to stay
under the radar?

669
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,245
To make it appear as if
they've got nothing to hide.

670
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,425
Their luggage
contains no match

671
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,915
for the clothes
in the museum footage.

672
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,362
At least
hold them overnight!

673
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:17,431
I can't hold suspects
more than 12 hours

674
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:18,998
without a formal arrest,

675
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,567
which I can't make
without sufficient evidence.

676
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,238
Best we can do is order them
to remain in Stockholm

677
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,661
as persons of interest,

678
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:27,696
mark their passports

679
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:29,431
and keep them
under surveillance.

680
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:35,037
I mean, have you ever
seen a file so thin?

681
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:38,574
It's like until four years
ago, they didn't exist.

682
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:42,745
Interpol is coordinating
with the US.

683
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,048
If there is something
out there, they'll find it.

684
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:52,788
Listen,

685
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:55,524
I had this case once.

686
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,373
The beautiful daughter of
the most celebrated architect

687
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:03,377
in Germany, beaten to death.

688
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:05,679
Her father hunted down
the guy who did it

689
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,336
and shot him 12 times.

690
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:11,874
Later, after the whole
thing calmed down,

691
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:14,443
he shot himself.

692
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:16,945
Well...

693
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,584
I'm not real sure how you
want me to respond to that.

694
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:27,056
Getting justice
won't be the end.

695
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:33,028
You see, the problem is
every time I close my eyes,

696
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:35,764
the image
that I see

697
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:38,901
is my daughter
laying on a cold slab.

698
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,470
And that's never
gonna go away.

699
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:49,545
I have to go now.

700
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:53,649
Safe travels.

701
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:57,820
Wait.

702
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:10,099
Think of her smiling.

703
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:15,871
How did you
get this?

704
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:18,574
Don't ask.

705
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,830
It is like I am bashing
my face into a wall

706
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:31,387
over and over again.

707
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:34,523
<i> Hey, it's okay.</i>

708
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:36,759
No, Val.

709
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:39,706
It's not okay.
I am telling you,

710
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,431
everyone has a history.
Everyone.

711
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:46,380
But these two,
there is just nothing.

712
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,837
It's like they're
goddamn ghosts.

713
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,407
<i>Maybe I can
call in a favour.</i>

714
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:55,956
<i>Jacob?
You still there?</i>

715
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,514
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here.

716
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,850
<i>I have some influence
with the DA's office.</i>

717
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,422
Thanks for
doing this, Bill.

718
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,526
People keep asking what
they can do to help, and...

719
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:14,163
There really isn't
anything. But I thought,

720
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,965
just maybe,
you might.

721
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:20,569
Does the name Simon Haysmith
mean anything to you?

722
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:23,550
You mean the guy
who defrauded some of

723
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:24,684
the richest men on Wall Street

724
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,819
for, like, 300 million?

725
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:27,370
Yeah, that's him. Yeah.

726
00:57:27,394 --> 00:57:28,922
The Feds spent a fortune in
taxpayer dollars

727
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,857
preparing to prosecute him.

728
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,692
They didn't have
the case they wanted,

729
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:34,550
so they squeezed his employees,
his accountants, attorneys...

730
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:36,963
But none of them
said anything, so,

731
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:38,932
one of the biggest white-collar
criminals in history

732
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,189
was about to walk away.

733
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,558
What does this have
to do with Kimberly?

734
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:44,571
Well, they were just about
to drop the charges

735
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:46,562
when out of nowhere, the
case was just given to them.

736
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,209
Bank account numbers
in Brussels, Cayman Islands,

737
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:50,911
and so on, and so on, and so on.

738
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:52,201
Somebody gave him up?

739
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,002
Who?

740
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:57,806
His son.

741
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:00,242
The son of a bitch's son.

742
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:02,811
Kid detests him,
wants him destroyed.

743
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:07,649
Are you telling me
that Mac is Haysmith's son?

744
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:09,218
Yes, I am.

745
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:12,566
Do you have any idea
why he gave him up?

746
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,023
No, not from the little bit
I've been able to access.

747
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:17,103
The real story is behind a
shit-load of

748
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,660
redactions in that file.

749
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:21,997
Witness protection.

750
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:25,178
Was he a minor
at the time?

751
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:26,079
Yup.

752
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:29,004
That's why the Bureau has kept
tight-lipped about everything.

753
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:32,274
And how old
was he then?

754
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,576
Fifteen.
<i>And the wife?</i>

755
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:35,944
No mention.

756
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,546
<i>And where's Haysmith?</i>

757
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:39,648
Doing life at Osborn.

758
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:42,762
<i>Well, can you
get in to see him?</i>

759
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,186
Oh, I'm trying.

760
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:05,207
Did you
sleep at all?

761
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:09,177
You know when you look
in someone's eyes

762
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,246
and you know
they're lying to you?

763
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:14,049
They're guilty.

764
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:17,553
I've never been more sure
about anything in 30 years.

765
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:34,636
<i>They've discovered
a fifth couple.</i>

766
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:37,105
<i>Outside Amsterdam.</i>

767
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:42,344
<i>Artist's studio, a bit
away from everything.</i>

768
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:50,953
The targeted journalist
was away on assignment.

769
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,222
You know what
I'm gonna ask.

770
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:57,993
At least
now you know.

771
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:06,034
Yeah, at least
I know.

772
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,794
She collects them.

773
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:36,732
Receipts. She collects
other people's receipts!

774
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:39,334
Museums,
ferries, restaurants.

775
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,815
Physical proof
of places

776
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,338
they were
supposed to have been!

777
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:49,655
<i> The artist must be</i>

778
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,258
<i>prepared to sacrifice
everything,</i>

779
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:53,849
<i>even life itself.</i>

780
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,298
No weakness!

781
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:13,268
"Art is a wound
turned into light."

782
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:19,441
Room service.

783
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:20,942
Come in.

784
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:27,994
How are we tonight?

785
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,184
Very well,
thank you.

786
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:35,268
Okay, so
they confirmed

787
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:38,226
the room service order was
placed from outside the hotel.

788
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,996
Apparently it's more
common than you'd think.

789
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:44,099
I need to see
a detailed map.

790
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,902
Use my computer.
I got to pee.

791
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:52,234
Excuse me.
Mac and Sylvia Randolph.

792
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,186
<i>Detective Kanon,
do not go to that room.</i>

793
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,188
No, they crafted
their own alibi.

794
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:04,179
You have no idea what's
staring you in the face.

795
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,282
Do you think
he saw?

796
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:09,284
Not sure.

797
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:11,019
We'll take
care of it.

798
01:03:30,174 --> 01:03:31,951
Police! Police!

799
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,850
They're gone.

800
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:44,319
We've marked their passports.
They can't go far.

801
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:47,889
They can go anywhere
they damn well please.

802
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,029
Jacob!

803
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:35,971
Jacob, I'm sorry.

804
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:38,184
I don't know
how much you read,

805
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,976
but it's not just
some tabloid expose.

806
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:44,145
It's about your loss and your
strength in the face of it.

807
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:48,227
Do what
you have to do.

808
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,085
I don't have to do anything.
I'm not going to submit it.

809
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:55,523
They got away.

810
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58,226
What?

811
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:00,362
Good night, Dessie.

812
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:02,497
Jacob.

813
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:08,503
I'm going to bed.

814
01:05:15,112 --> 01:05:17,379
<i>I mean, who knows if
Haysmith will agree to see me.</i>

815
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:19,981
I just can't sit at home
doing nothing anymore.

816
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,320
<i> Valerie...</i>
It's probably locked.

817
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:26,688
Right?

818
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,257
Yes.

819
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:34,095
Okay, should I try
the back?

820
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:43,638
<i>You know, breaking and entering,
that is 10 to 15 minimum.</i>

821
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:45,273
That's all?

822
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:56,284
Wow, this place is massive.

823
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,433
Just another empty room.

824
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:19,040
<i>Wait, wait, wait, slow
down. What is that?</i>

825
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:23,044
I don't know but there's a lock
on the outside. It's weird.

826
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:27,115
Hello? Hello?

827
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:29,317
I have called
the police!

828
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:31,252
Oh, shit,
I got to call you back.

829
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:36,302
We're always having
trouble with squatters,

830
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,159
what with the house being empty
for nearly four years.

831
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:40,373
And if it's not them,
it's the press...

832
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,464
You know, what with
what happened here.

833
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,478
Will you forgive me?
Please forgive me.

834
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:46,980
Of course.
Let me make you a coffee.

835
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:48,403
Oh, you're so sweet,
thank you.

836
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:50,316
I'm your new
neighbour, Nancy.

837
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,773
Oh, Valerie.
So nice to meet you.

838
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,519
I didn't really call
the police, by the way.

839
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:54,709
Thank God.

840
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:59,325
The boy, Simon Jr, was
friends with my son, Evan.

841
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:02,717
He was a sweet child.
Very smart, good at sports.

842
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,387
He came over here sometimes,
to do his homework.

843
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:07,700
And then something
changed, around...

844
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:09,502
I don't remember exactly,

845
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,792
maybe when
he was 10?

846
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:12,794
What changed?

847
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,263
He kind of
went quiet.

848
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:18,033
I knew something was wrong,
but it didn't make any sense.

849
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:20,468
Not then, at least.
What do you mean?

850
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:24,450
Well, Simon Sr was on two
boards with my husband,

851
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:27,175
a big philanthropist and an
active member of the church.

852
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:29,689
His wife, Irina, was
a stay-at-home mom.

853
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:31,524
Oh, she was beautiful.

854
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:33,593
She looked a bit like
Melania Trump,

855
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:35,316
with those big
Slavic eyes.

856
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:38,620
She used to be a model, I
think, from Russia originally.

857
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:41,823
Mmm, more wine?

858
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,369
Oh, I shouldn't.

859
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,428
If you want the whole story,
you most definitely should.

860
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:47,796
Thank you.

861
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:52,267
She loved to bake pies.

862
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:55,437
Around Thanksgiving, she would
bake five different kinds.

863
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:57,639
They seemed to be
the perfect couple.

864
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:00,553
And then
she killed herself.

865
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,411
Oh, my God. How?

866
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,747
Hanging.
The kids found her.

867
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:08,127
Oh, "kids." Simon...

868
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:09,651
Simon had
an older sister, Marina.

869
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,086
Ah.

870
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,656
Their father
was so strict,

871
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:17,202
the kids were always,

872
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,138
"Yes, please" and
"Thank you, ma'am."

873
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:21,262
He pushed them to be
the best at everything,

874
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:25,100
forever dragging them to
some art exhibition or lecture.

875
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:27,302
Didn't seem to
want them to have any fun.

876
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:29,270
Never, ever
went on holidays.

877
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:33,341
One time, Marina dripped
ice cream on her top.

878
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:35,877
And Simon Sr
took her inside the house.

879
01:08:36,847 --> 01:08:39,247
And when they came out,
she wouldn't speak,

880
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,149
wouldn't say a word.

881
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,751
Did you find out
what happened?

882
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,668
I found out later, he
had beaten her so hard,

883
01:08:48,692 --> 01:08:51,471
she had welts on
her backside.

884
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:52,861
My neighbour
was cruel...

885
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,208
He demanded perfection
from his family,

886
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:57,143
especially his children,

887
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:59,212
and if they didn't achieve
his high standards immediately,

888
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:00,802
he would
whip it out of them.

889
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,872
I told my husband
I had suspicions,

890
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:06,886
but he just told me
to mind my own business.

891
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,521
Do you know
where they are now?

892
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,556
Haven't seen Marina since she
left for boarding school,

893
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,348
and I think Simon was taken
by Child Protective Services.

894
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,932
<i>It's a break in the pattern.</i>

895
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:34,335
Not a married couple, fewer
days between murders,

896
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,516
and no real
signs of violence.

897
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,274
Actually, Mr Melitz and Mr
Riniker were recently married.

898
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:40,653
Belgium was one of
the first countries

899
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,755
to allow
same-sex marriage.

900
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:44,279
This is where
it happened.

901
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:54,600
We found this postcard
at the CNN offices.

902
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:56,391
Wait, was there
a photograph with it?

903
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:57,725
No photo.

904
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:01,262
"It has come full circle."

905
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:04,632
The handwriting
looks different.

906
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:08,670
No photograph.
No unconnected body parts.

907
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:10,850
Gay couple...

908
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:12,552
You think
it's a copycat?

909
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:15,810
How could the Randolphs
have left Stockholm undetected?

910
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:17,779
Look.

911
01:10:18,582 --> 01:10:21,382
Bouguereau's
<i>Dante and Virgil in Hell.</i>

912
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:25,253
Bill's got me in to see
Haysmith. I got to run.

913
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,299
<i> Valerie...</i>

914
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,656
Yes, yes,
I'll be careful.

915
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:35,597
Bublitz sent the photos,
and also

916
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:38,399
the crime scene photos
of Amsterdam.

917
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:40,969
Look.

918
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,975
Wait, wait, go...
Go back.

919
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:54,916
That's my
grandmother's ring.

920
01:10:55,986 --> 01:10:57,897
That's my
daughter's hand!

921
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,332
I'm so sorry.

922
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:01,356
That's my
daughter's hand.

923
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:03,591
No.

924
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:07,462
I'm sorry.

925
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,399
My daughter's hand...

926
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:18,784
Got 15 minutes, ma'am.

927
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:30,563
Forgive me
for staring.

928
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:31,697
You're the first
good-looking woman

929
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:35,901
I've seen in a very long time.

930
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:39,060
Do you have a mind
to match that face?

931
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,965
A mind brilliant enough
to get me out of here?

932
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:48,703
We're building a case
to launch an appeal.

933
01:11:49,572 --> 01:11:51,572
I found a number
of inconsistencies

934
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:53,775
in the evidence
provided by your son.

935
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:57,545
Did they tell you
he defiled a de Kooning?

936
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:01,449
Those two had everything.
Everything!

937
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:04,752
You cannot buy the kind
of education they had.

938
01:12:06,056 --> 01:12:09,057
Respect for money
is important to you, isn't it?

939
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:10,658
Of course.

940
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:15,697
Listen to me
very carefully.

941
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,468
The sins of the father
this is not.

942
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:26,941
Care to elaborate?

943
01:12:27,577 --> 01:12:28,688
Oh!

944
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:30,323
We have 15 minutes
together, Ms Kanon,

945
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:31,891
can we please not spend it
talking about

946
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:33,426
these ungrateful
bastards?

947
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,761
Let's talk about
politics, art.

948
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:39,498
Let's talk about the late
works of the Cubists,

949
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:43,391
how the Expressionists
were a reaction to fascism.

950
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:46,861
Or how being sent to boarding
school affects your child?

951
01:12:48,765 --> 01:12:50,409
What happened
to your daughter?

952
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:51,799
There seems
no trace of her.

953
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:56,749
We're looking for cause.

954
01:12:56,773 --> 01:12:59,574
Why would Simon Jr
make up stories about you?

955
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:03,845
Did you know your senses get
heightened in this place?

956
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:07,548
I don't know why.

957
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,485
Perhaps it's all the noise,

958
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:12,987
followed by
the silence.

959
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:17,903
A father's duty is to
teach, and I did just that.

960
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:21,863
I taught them culture,
ethics, morality, discipline.

961
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:23,498
Is that right?

962
01:13:26,136 --> 01:13:27,702
Oh, you're just like her.

963
01:13:31,107 --> 01:13:32,907
Devious little bitch.

964
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:39,447
Young girls
need to be just that.

965
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:42,049
Young girls.

966
01:13:53,163 --> 01:13:54,695
You'll find them together.

967
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:57,832
You can't
keep them apart...

968
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:00,701
Except by force.

969
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,670
That's something
you're very good at.

970
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:04,572
Oh, are you
judging me?

971
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:07,675
Oh, I think
a court already did that.

972
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:10,623
Well, society is
full of wrong decisions

973
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:13,181
made by decent people.
Take me, for example.

974
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,982
I met with you

975
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:17,952
because I actually thought
you might be able to help me.

976
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:20,855
Well, that was a huge error
of judgement on your part.

977
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,758
So I take it you won't
be handling my appeal.

978
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,230
<i>Enchante, madame.</i>

979
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:33,234
<i>Enchante.</i>

980
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:42,721
It seems the majority of
Haysmith's rage was...

981
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:44,890
Was focused on the girl.

982
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:46,959
So, Marina gets sent away
to boarding school,

983
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,817
and Simon stops at
nothing to get her back.

984
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:52,620
That is
one hell of a brother.

985
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:54,689
Unless...

986
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,626
Unless it's
more than that.

987
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:00,728
What do you mean?

988
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:05,233
Valerie said that Haysmith
called Marina "a devious bitch",

989
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:06,679
but he also said
something about

990
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:09,248
young girls needing to be
young girls,

991
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:11,906
and that it would take force
to keep them apart.

992
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:17,011
Christ.

993
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,181
Mac and
Sylvia Randolph...

994
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:26,787
They are Marina
and Simon Haysmith.

995
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:29,768
What?

996
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:31,770
I mean, our suspects that we've
been chasing across Europe,

997
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:32,905
they're not married,
they're not...

998
01:15:32,929 --> 01:15:34,507
They're not husband and wife,

999
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:36,264
they are
brother and sister.

1000
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:38,933
<i>Head of
Saint John the Baptist.</i>

1001
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,235
What?

1002
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:46,541
<i>Head of
Saint John the Baptist.</i>

1003
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:51,779
A fitting tribute
to that sadistic bastard.

1004
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:55,883
We have to make sure
that everyone knows,

1005
01:15:56,586 --> 01:15:58,119
and most importantly, why.

1006
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,924
He took beauty and made
it cruel and ugly.

1007
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:07,762
Will they even let him see,
do you think?

1008
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:12,600
I want him to see
the destruction, Marina.

1009
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,070
I want him to hurt

1010
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,573
like we did.
Hey, hey.

1011
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:20,875
I'm here.

1012
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,011
I'm right here.

1013
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:28,883
We have fucked with
his notion of perfection.

1014
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,754
That'll get inside his mind
like no incarceration can.

1015
01:16:49,038 --> 01:16:51,172
I know I shouldn't,
but I almost feel...

1016
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:55,076
They're playing out
their story.

1017
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:59,614
Look,<i> The Kiss,</i>
the pain of lovers torn apart.

1018
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:02,083
<i>Saturn Devouring
His Son,</i>

1019
01:17:02,352 --> 01:17:04,285
the father that
destroyed their lives.

1020
01:17:06,723 --> 01:17:08,756
It all makes
horrible, twisted sense.

1021
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,325
Love, pain, death...

1022
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:14,172
Completion.

1023
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:16,163
Yeah, but the last postcard
still had an ellipsis.

1024
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:20,167
They're not
finished yet.

1025
01:17:21,671 --> 01:17:23,771
The message they're sending
is that their love is valid.

1026
01:17:24,841 --> 01:17:27,720
They are angry at the world
for not accepting them.

1027
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:30,723
I think the murders in Brussels
were exact and purposeful,

1028
01:17:30,747 --> 01:17:31,323
not random.

1029
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:32,358
Why?

1030
01:17:32,382 --> 01:17:35,761
Because other forms of love,
for centuries forbidden,

1031
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:37,818
are now accepted by most,

1032
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:42,934
but not theirs.

1033
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,858
To feel powerful in the
face of powerlessness.

1034
01:17:45,428 --> 01:17:46,927
Yeah, exactly.

1035
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:51,132
What if we took that
away from them?

1036
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:53,078
How do you mean?

1037
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:54,969
That article you were
going to write about me...

1038
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:29,048
<i>My name is Dave Bennings and
I'm with my brothers,</i>

1039
01:18:29,072 --> 01:18:31,005
<i>Brian and Jesse, and our
partner, Peter.</i>

1040
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,376
Simon, babe,
come here.

1041
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:41,482
"Over the last
two weeks,

1042
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,897
"I've had a front-row seat
to the investigation

1043
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:46,432
"of the serial murders

1044
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:48,289
"dubbed 'The Postcard Killings'.

1045
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,769
"They've dominated our
headlines,

1046
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:52,705
"but the media
analysis is wrong.

1047
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:55,207
"As odd as it sounds,

1048
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,733
"these crimes are not driven
by bloodlust or cruelty.

1049
01:18:59,836 --> 01:19:02,181
"Instead, they are
a cry for understanding..."

1050
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:05,172
"I've had a front-row seat via
Detective Jacob Kanon,

1051
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:07,441
"the American father
of one of the victims.

1052
01:19:08,344 --> 01:19:10,311
"He's an
outsider here, like me,

1053
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,225
"but he will not let
the grimness of this world

1054
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,793
"distract him from
his commitment

1055
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:17,096
"to find justice for
his daughter.

1056
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,220
"Because unlike
the killers' family,

1057
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:22,356
"this father's love
is 100%..."

1058
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,737
"It is obvious from
the brutality of the crimes

1059
01:19:24,761 --> 01:19:27,762
"that the killers had a
horribly abusive childhood.

1060
01:19:28,898 --> 01:19:31,043
"The words on their postcards
have been kept guarded,

1061
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:32,900
"but they reveal
a rage

1062
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:35,114
"and passionate commitment
to the validity

1063
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:38,016
"of their own struggle...

1064
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,107
"And that struggle
is their message.

1065
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:43,377
"And that message
is justice..."

1066
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,181
"But now we have heard
you, and you can stop.

1067
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:51,786
"This has been difficult
for me, and frightening,

1068
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:54,355
"but Jacob has shown me

1069
01:19:56,058 --> 01:19:59,894
"what it means
to be really good.

1070
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:01,896
"A good detective,

01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:04,031
"a good father,

1072
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,134
"a good man."

1073
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:17,978
We make her
our final piece.

1074
01:20:19,282 --> 01:20:20,915
She makes
everything complete.

1075
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:22,283
Maybe we
should stop.

1076
01:20:24,387 --> 01:20:26,298
Get a car,
disappear.

1077
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,321
No.

1078
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:29,434
Maybe we
should split up?

1079
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:30,969
We're not splitting up!

1080
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,887
I want to
live a normal life.

1081
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,828
That's what we are doing,
creating a chance for that.

1082
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:37,464
Artists were judged
in their lifetimes,

1083
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,278
just as we are.

1084
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:41,335
My God, do you really
care about this?

1085
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:45,272
All I care about
is losing you.

1086
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:58,419
We shouldn't
have to hide anymore.

1087
01:20:58,588 --> 01:20:59,948
I went to the police

1088
01:20:59,972 --> 01:21:01,333
so that we didn't
have to live like this.

1089
01:21:22,411 --> 01:21:25,156
"Thank you, Ms Lombard,

1090
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,926
"for telling our story with the
meaningful heart it deserves.

1091
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,583
"The curtain is
pulled back."

1092
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:33,120
I don't
understand.

1093
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,522
Iron Curtain.
Mother was Russian.

1094
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:39,638
Irina Smirnova, she, erm,
was born in St Petersburg.

1095
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:41,039
She moved to the US
with her parents

1096
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,975
after the Soviet Union
collapsed.

1097
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:44,993
My guess is
they're travelling

1098
01:21:45,017 --> 01:21:47,012
under the name Simon
and Marina Haysmith again,

1099
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:48,502
using their
Russian passports.

1100
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:51,105
Which would explain
how they left Sweden.

1101
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:53,340
And how they
passed across borders.

1102
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:57,205
If we checked,

1103
01:21:57,229 --> 01:21:59,391
I'll bet Haysmith is using
a bank account in Brussels.

1104
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:02,227
Or what if Brussels was
not to throw us off,

1105
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,629
just to redirect
our thinking.

1106
01:22:03,653 --> 01:22:06,064
No, look, we know
that they're heading northeast.

1107
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,533
They cross the border on
the other side of Helsinki,

1108
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,691
they're damn near
in St Petersburg.

1109
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:14,662
If they make it to Russia,
they're virtually untouchable.

1110
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:16,497
No extradition treaties.

1111
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:19,099
Jesus. Why can't we
catch a break here?

1112
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:23,537
A postcard turned up at a
newspaper in Paris this morning,

1113
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,518
and in Hamburg,
and in Budapest...

1114
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:27,942
What did they say?

1115
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,209
All the same.

1116
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,189
"Now we are reborn."

1117
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:32,424
With a "dot, dot, dot"?

1118
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,014
No, just a single dot.

1119
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:44,002
I'll loop in Hoglund
and Interpol,

1120
01:22:44,026 --> 01:22:47,205
see if we can trace
the email.

1121
01:22:47,229 --> 01:22:49,229
There's a manhunt
across Europe.

1122
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:51,732
In the meantime
sit tight, my friend.

1123
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:54,601
Not a
chance in hell.

1124
01:22:56,072 --> 01:22:57,404
I'm going back
to Munich.

1125
01:22:57,606 --> 01:22:59,039
Understood.

1126
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,641
You do
what is expected.

1127
01:23:01,577 --> 01:23:03,210
I'm going to
do what's needed.

1128
01:23:15,591 --> 01:23:17,491
I know you know
how to use this.

1129
01:23:19,762 --> 01:23:21,595
Only you can determine
if you should.

1130
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,681
<i>How far
to the Russian border?</i>

1131
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,372
<i>Around three hours.
There's only one road.</i>

1132
01:25:40,436 --> 01:25:42,202
Is it them?
Yeah, it's them.

1133
01:26:40,496 --> 01:26:41,662
Dessie!

1134
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:43,864
Dessie!

1135
01:27:28,844 --> 01:27:30,344
Morning.

1136
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:35,782
We knew
you'd figure it out.

1137
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:39,820
It was Mac's idea to mention
the curtain being pulled back.

1138
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:43,635
Our mother was the one
good thing in our lives.

1139
01:27:43,659 --> 01:27:45,559
She tried to
protect us from him.

1140
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:48,673
But monsters
will remain monsters,

1141
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:50,497
no matter what you try
to do to tame them.

1142
01:27:59,624 --> 01:28:01,341
For centuries, artists have
killed things in a moment.

1143
01:28:02,544 --> 01:28:03,810
We reinvented that.

1144
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:08,315
When you wrote about the
intensity of our rage,

1145
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:10,384
it was
so perceptive.

1146
01:28:13,422 --> 01:28:14,921
You were lucky
to have each other.

1147
01:28:16,725 --> 01:28:18,725
My father wasn't
a good man either.

1148
01:28:19,728 --> 01:28:21,962
If I'd had a brother, it
would have been easier.

1149
01:28:22,598 --> 01:28:24,564
That man deserves
to rot in hell.

1150
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,579
Who can say how we feel
is "unacceptable"?

1151
01:28:27,603 --> 01:28:28,969
Love is love.

1152
01:28:31,907 --> 01:28:33,307
I like you.

1153
01:28:36,712 --> 01:28:38,378
So why don't you
let me go?

1154
01:28:48,724 --> 01:28:50,457
Hey, stop, stop!

1155
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:51,992
I wouldn't...
Mac, this is good.

1156
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,307
Mac, stop the car.

1157
01:28:55,331 --> 01:28:56,496
Listen...

1158
01:28:58,967 --> 01:29:01,835
Sylvia, listen,
please... Let me go!

1159
01:29:02,071 --> 01:29:03,537
Shh.

1160
01:29:10,579 --> 01:29:11,712
Please.

1161
01:29:13,716 --> 01:29:14,748
I'm so cold...

1162
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,516
It won't take very long.

1163
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,731
And I promise, you won't
feel any pain.

1164
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:20,954
Okay?

1165
01:29:22,758 --> 01:29:24,057
We good to go?

1166
01:29:27,563 --> 01:29:28,662
Perfect.

1167
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:32,577
There they are.

1168
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:34,601
Modigilani's
<i>Reclining Nude.</i>

1169
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,373
"Art is a wound
turned into light."

1170
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:59,493
Look, you drink this, you
won't feel any pain. Okay?

1171
01:30:01,997 --> 01:30:03,508
Come on.
Come on.

1172
01:30:07,469 --> 01:30:08,935
Christ!
Fuck you!

1173
01:30:19,181 --> 01:30:21,615
Do you think
that you can stop this?

1174
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:28,889
Now, one more time.

1175
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,858
Step away from her.

1176
01:30:32,127 --> 01:30:33,627
Hands where
I can see them.

1177
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:43,770
Your daughter
was lovely.

1178
01:30:44,673 --> 01:30:46,417
Shut up.

1179
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,208
She had the longest
fingers, so graceful.

1180
01:30:51,013 --> 01:30:52,490
You didn't know
my daughter.

1181
01:30:52,514 --> 01:30:53,814
You don't get
to talk about her.

1182
01:30:54,082 --> 01:30:55,715
But she
talked about you.

1183
01:30:56,852 --> 01:30:58,218
She talked
about you a lot.

1184
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:05,058
She said she wished kids had a
say in their parents' divorce.

1185
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,464
Our father
was nothing like you.

1186
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:13,834
But your mother...

1187
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:17,637
It must have really hurt
when she died, huh?

1188
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:23,243
He took
everything from her,

1189
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,580
till there
was nothing left.

1190
01:31:42,631 --> 01:31:44,130
Marina,
we okay?

1191
01:31:57,713 --> 01:31:58,857
No!

1192
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:02,716
No!

1193
01:32:02,885 --> 01:32:04,829
No! No!

1194
01:32:18,834 --> 01:32:20,534
You're not gonna
go after them?

1195
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,603
Nowhere
for them to go.

1196
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,547
Marina,
are we going home?

1197
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:37,117
Yes. The sun
never sets there. Never.

1198
01:32:38,654 --> 01:32:39,786
We'll be accepted.

1199
01:32:40,556 --> 01:32:41,788
No one can
hurt us again.

1200
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:20,638
Hello.

1201
01:33:20,662 --> 01:33:21,861
Hey.

1202
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:25,332
I was worried I wasn't
gonna get to see you again.

1203
01:33:27,302 --> 01:33:28,702
Ready to go?

1204
01:33:29,137 --> 01:33:30,704
Yes, I am.
Let me carry that.

1205
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:35,987
Your countrymen will be
reading the salacious details

1206
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:37,377
over their cornflakes.

1207
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,947
Somehow just compounds
the tragedy of it all.

1208
01:33:41,717 --> 01:33:44,351
Haysmith has enormous amounts
of blood on his hands.

1209
01:33:45,754 --> 01:33:46,987
And really,

1210
01:33:47,856 --> 01:33:49,856
no family
connection at all?

1211
01:33:50,826 --> 01:33:52,359
They were
adopted at birth

1212
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:55,362
three years apart,
from two different states.

1213
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:57,642
According to
press reports,

1214
01:33:57,666 --> 01:33:59,633
he had this attorney
on retainer.

1215
01:33:59,968 --> 01:34:02,335
Was very specific
on what he wanted.

1216
01:34:02,671 --> 01:34:04,104
Sign, please.
Looks, background...

1217
01:34:05,941 --> 01:34:09,142
Early genetic engineering
at its finest.

1218
01:34:10,012 --> 01:34:10,910
Exactly.

1219
01:34:12,214 --> 01:34:13,825
Seemingly, he was
impotent in more

1220
01:34:13,849 --> 01:34:18,363
than just the
emotional sense.

1221
01:34:18,387 --> 01:34:19,919
Damn, you know...

1222
01:34:21,223 --> 01:34:22,822
Simon and Marina, they
could have gotten married,

1223
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:25,036
lived happily
ever after,

1224
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:26,893
and my daughter
and all those others...

1225
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:31,331
They would
still be alive.

1226
01:34:33,235 --> 01:34:34,734
Ah.

1227
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:39,005
Everything is arranged,
car to the airport,

1228
01:34:39,775 --> 01:34:42,175
a plane to take you
to London so that you...

1229
01:34:43,111 --> 01:34:44,744
Well, you know,

1230
01:34:46,114 --> 01:34:47,313
bring her home.

1231
01:34:48,884 --> 01:34:50,083
Yeah.

1232
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,352
You're a good man.

1233
01:34:53,388 --> 01:34:55,055
Thank you
for everything.

1234
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,760
And you'll let me know
when they find their bodies?

1235
01:35:03,432 --> 01:35:05,832
It was nice to have you
with me on my last case.

1236
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,003
What will
you do tomorrow?

1237
01:35:12,474 --> 01:35:13,951
Fire my dog walker.

1238
01:35:17,846 --> 01:35:19,179
Don't end up like me.

1239
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:22,115
Find a new
beginning.

1240
01:35:36,732 --> 01:35:38,031
We raised
a great kid.

1241
01:35:40,435 --> 01:35:41,712
She was happy.

1242
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,036
Well, at least
we got something right.

1243
01:35:46,775 --> 01:35:48,308
I think
we got it all right.

1244
01:35:50,212 --> 01:35:51,444
Till we didn't.

1245
01:35:53,515 --> 01:35:54,948
"We"?

1246
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:03,189
You probably don't
want to, but,

1247
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,158
people are coming
back to my place...

1248
01:36:05,527 --> 01:36:08,828
Oh... I will see
you there in a bit.

1249
01:36:46,802 --> 01:36:48,034
Oh, kiddo.

1250
01:36:50,105 --> 01:36:51,938
I'm gonna
miss you so much.

1251
01:37:10,192 --> 01:37:11,324
Yeah?

1252
01:37:16,832 --> 01:37:18,598
Haysmith?
Yeah?

1253
01:37:19,067 --> 01:37:20,233
You got a call.

1254
01:37:26,374 --> 01:37:27,473
Thanks.

1255
01:37:28,977 --> 01:37:31,344
Hello? Hello?

1256
01:37:34,216 --> 01:37:35,359
Hello?
