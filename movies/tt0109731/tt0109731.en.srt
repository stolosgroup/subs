2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,000
HELL

3
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,600
- Like it?
- It's perfect

4
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,600
You have visitors

5
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,700
Are we in the way?

6
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,700
- Are you pleased?
- So far. Want to see?

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,600
- That's why we're here
- Follow your guide

8
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,100
Big, isn't it?

9
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,900
You haven't seen half of it.
That's to be my apartment

10
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,700
With two rooms for kids

11
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
There's a room almost ready here

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,900
It must be costing a packet

13
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
It's really comfortable

14
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
- I renewed all the bedding
- Where's the money coming from?

15
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Fifteen years of hard-earned savings,
plus what my mother left me

16
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,900
Most of it's thanks to my bank;
I'm in debt to here!

17
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,300
Got a light?

18
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,900
Next year I'll build a
landing-stage here

19
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,200
I'll buy you an electric razor

20
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,000
No, this is perfect

21
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,700
Come here, let me see

22
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,900
He's walking, Nelly, come and look

23
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,800
I know he's walking

24
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,700
The light... I'd rather it was off

25
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,400
Just a bad dream; I won't be long

26
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,500
- "What are you doing here?"
- The kid crying... I can't sleep

27
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,700
I'm sleeping very badly just now

28
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,900
- What are you doing here?
- What was up with him?

29
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Just a bad dream. Come to bed

30
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Coming to bed?

31
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,900
I think you've lost it

32
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,500
- I feel I won't get to sleep all night
- Yes, you will

33
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,300
I'll get a pill for you;
I'm good at that

34
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,300
You work too hard,
so you're over-tired

35
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,900
But you'll sleep with what I gave you

36
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,500
Put out the light

37
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,900
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well

38
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,700
Even my husband, who's so
susceptible to noise

39
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,400
Luckily the planes had a quiet night

40
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,900
That's not all I'm susceptible to

41
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,800
Waking here in the morning is pure joy

42
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,200
Then you must come again
during the season

43
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,900
My husband would really like it

44
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,700
With a month's notice, I can
see you get a good room

45
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The same one, if possible

46
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,300
He's put chocolate on your face

47
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
- A bit behind, aren't you?
- Vincent wanted chocolate

48
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,700
- You'll be late for school
- I'm always early

49
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,900
- You'll be right back?
- No, I've things to do

50
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
- For the hotel?
- No, for me

51
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,600
Clothilde will be in at ten
to finish the accounts

52
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,300
That's just a curtain-raiser

53
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Open wide, boy

54
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,600
Sleeping pills can backfire on you

55
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,100
Nothing serious this time

56
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,000
What did I tell you?

57
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,900
You can open the curtains, Nelly

58
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,200
He was imagining cancer of the throat

59
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,900
Right now he makes mountains out of
everything, for no reason

60
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,400
I don't do it for fun

61
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He can't relax, that's all

62
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,900
- Relaxing isn't the problem
- What is, then?

63
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,800
I don't know

64
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,900
Here's the prescription

65
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,900
Why not go with the doctor, get the
medicine and collect our car?

66
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,900
- Would you mind, Doctor?
- Not at all, if we go now

67
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,500
Leaving me without a kiss?

68
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,300
Monsieur and Madame Vernon!

69
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,900
We told you we'd come back

70
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,300
I had to juggle, but you've
the same room

71
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,900
Come and see the view, darling

72
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
Finished the letters?

73
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,900
No, I was seeing to the insurance
cards first

74
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,900
My wife didn't do that?

75
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,100
She was at the beach

76
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,600
I must get these X-rays to
Madame Point

77
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,900
Please tell that child to do
her aerobatics elsewhere

78
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,400
Your X-rays, Madame Point

79
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,500
Madame Point wants you to
play elsewhere

80
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,900
- Where can I go?
- Try the tarred road, that's smooth

81
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,200
- Have you tried skating on it?
- Yes, well, go on anyway

82
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,400
- Life's too short for abstinence
- I don't abstain

83
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,300
Two cognacs, Julien

84
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
And one for the boss

85
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,200
- A drink, Doctor?
- Never on duty, like the cops

86
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,700
Nothing for me, then

87
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm going to town; is my car ready?

88
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,900
I'm having the weekend off

89
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
- When did Dad say it would be ready?
- Yesterday

90
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,300
So it's ready; you can trust him

91
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,700
The baby's all right?
So Nelly can join us

92
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,100
No, she should stay with him

93
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,900
We were expecting her to join us

94
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
It was great this morning

95
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Another time, all right?

96
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,600
Watch out: That's what
having kids means

97
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,600
I'Iljust go and see her

98
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,900
She's busy; go and enjoy yourself

99
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,700
- You're pretty curt with your guests
- She's a friend

100
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,900
I hope she knows that

101
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,300
Vincent's not really ill?

102
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,800
It's your pills that worry me

103
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,900
- I need them to sleep
- Well, just watch it

104
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
Not overdoing your drinking?

105
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,200
In this business you can't
always refuse

106
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
You've got problems?

107
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,500
Money problems, I mean.
How's business?

108
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,500
As good as can be expected

109
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,100
I'm not ill, Doctor

110
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Are your competitors hurting you?

111
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,100
They're amateurs

112
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
But doing well?

113
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,900
Well, it's easy to sweeten the coach-
drivers and serve the customers shit

114
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,900
You sweat blood for years,
setting up a decent business...

115
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,700
...and some ponce muscles in

116
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,200
Where's the justice in that?

117
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,900
You waste no time, Monsieur Duhamel!

118
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,600
It's the magic hour, Monsieur Prieur

119
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,200
Things are already starting to change

120
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,000
- Haven't you a camcorder?
- Never, Monsieur Prieur

121
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Big screen cinema, that's the thing

122
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,300
- What's new?
- The Duchemins called, hopping mad

123
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,100
They should have booked earlier.
I'll write to them

124
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,200
But the Mayor of Villeneuve's
daughter's wedding is on Saturday

125
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,300
- Did my wife speak to him?
- No, I rang her but got no reply

126
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
She'll have been with Vincent

127
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,200
No, Julie was looking after him

128
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,900
Never mind... I'll take the medicine up

129
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,200
Paul... what's up?

130
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
He was showing me his slides

131
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,400
In the dark?

132
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,300
Yes, they show up better

133
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,700
Did you get the medicine?

134
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,300
Do you know the time? You should be
in the dining-room

135
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,200
Already?

136
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,100
Did you get your car?

137
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,600
Yes, of course

138
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,900
- Out for a bit of air, Monsieur Paul?
- Lovely day, isn't it?

139
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,400
<i>Now you know where you are</i>

140
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,800
She didn't look guilty

141
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,100
<i>No, she didn't. Do you find that
reassuring?</i>

142
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,300
But in the lounge... she's not a fool

143
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,200
"No," she "isn't"

144
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,200
Is the menu to your liking?

145
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,600
No meat at night for me.
May I have an omelette?

146
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,800
- Of course. With ham, herbs, cheese?
- No, just eggs

147
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,600
- We searched everywhere for you
- I went for a walk, didn't feel well

148
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,500
What's wrong?

149
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,200
Just tired; I feel better now

150
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,100
More moonshine!

151
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,200
- Let me carry your things
- No, let me. I was extravagant today

152
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,800
It's the privilege of pretty women
to ruin us

153
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,200
You look better, my pet.
Have you been good?

154
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Angelic

155
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,500
Here's a good cure

156
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
What do you say?

157
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Don't ask too much of him

158
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,500
This is yours

159
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
- I'll bet it's a nightdress
- See-through!

160
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Thanks for keeping me company

161
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,900
It was a pleasure; think of me
the next time you go

162
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,600
Aren't you putting it on a bit?

163
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,900
He likes to play the gallant.
Where's the harm?

164
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,900
Bathtime, you

165
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,700
No more sore throat?

166
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,400
Give me your other foot

167
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,700
- Did you pay the printer?
- Yes, I went just after lunch

168
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,600
He called at three, wanting his money

169
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
I must have arrived just after

170
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,200
You stayed at mother's till three?

171
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,900
Of course not

172
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,200
Weren't you lunching with her?

173
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,500
It's too hot for that

174
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,400
Weren't you lunching with her?

175
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,600
She had a new pupil

176
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,100
Endless scales... so I ate
at the shop with Marilyn

177
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,900
You be a big boy and ask Clothilde
or Marie to cook you something

178
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,200
How about a kiss for daddy?

179
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,800
I feel like a shower. How about you?

180
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,900
What did the customers do
while you ate in the shop?

181
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,700
Nobody turned up

182
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,500
Until three o'clock?

183
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,900
I don't spend my time watching clocks

184
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Now hold on...

185
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,300
Let me have a look

186
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,400
Come into the light

187
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,000
- I don't believe it
- What?

188
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,900
You're jealous

189
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,700
I'm so glad; it proves
you care for me

190
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,900
I'll be catching cold

191
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,400
Don't mind me

192
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,600
Sorry, it was pure curiosity

193
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,300
- Nice, isn't it?
- Must have cost a packet, though

194
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Guess

195
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,300
5,000 francs

196
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,300
Where would I get that much?
Dry me, instead of talking nonsense

197
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,700
- What "did" it cost?
- You never let an idea go, do you?

198
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,300
1,500 francs. Surprised?

199
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,300
You bet I'm surprised

200
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,900
Old Montignac took some beating down

201
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,600
- There's mail?
- A letter from my brother

202
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,400
- Where is he right now?
- In Germany, at Koblenz

203
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,900
I'll take the stamp to my dressmaker
for her son

204
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,200
- Where are you going?
- My mother's

205
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,600
- Again?
- To help. I told you she wasn't well

206
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,700
You told me that?

207
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,800
The doctor's right; you're not well

208
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,600
My bus! Call and say I'm coming

209
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
My wife's just coming

210
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,500
<i>Alibi</i>

211
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,800
Don't do it, watch out

212
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,400
Don't do it, watch out for yourself

213
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,400
<i>Now, if she's not ather mother's,
you'll know</i>

214
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,100
She's out, giving a lesson in town

215
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,700
Daydreaming as usual

216
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,000
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for mother

217
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,400
- I thought she wasn't well
- You know that doesn't stop her

218
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,300
Why are you here? Is Vincent ill?

219
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,900
No, I was just passing

220
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Why?

221
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,400
I was at the Hoteliers' Association

222
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:58,300
I don't want to seem picky, but
that's across town. Where's the car?

223
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,700
Place Jeanne d'Arc

224
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,200
The bus terminal

225
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,300
Could you be following me?

226
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Have I any reason to?

227
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,200
No, but I could arrange it if you like

228
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,600
This is silly; let's drop it

229
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,300
Say something nice

230
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,200
- Is your brother still liking Germany?
- He sends his love

231
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,300
What else? Treat me to some of
his deathless prose

232
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,600
How stupid... Mum has it

233
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,900
She was out

234
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,800
- I put it through her letter-box
- You think fast... like the handbag

235
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,200
It cost 4,000 francs.
I called Montignac

236
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,400
Such trust you have

237
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,200
The fact is, I won on the horses

238
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,600
You gamble?

239
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,900
From time to time

240
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,200
Why didn't you tell me?

241
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,500
You'd have blamed Marilyn

242
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,700
Where did you place the bet?

243
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,200
The café across the bridge

244
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,300
They're closed this week

245
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,700
Granny died. Water's leaking, too

246
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,700
Is that you, Paul?

247
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,200
It's all finished, nothing left.
I'm closing

248
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,900
What's wrong, Paul?

249
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,600
Are you ill? An accident?

250
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,600
Answer me... say something

251
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,900
Where have you been?

252
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,900
You scare me, just standing there

253
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,900
Can I help?

254
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,900
Do you want to be on your own?

255
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,000
What is it, Paul?

256
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,200
We looked everywhere for you,
on the road, by the lake...

257
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,900
...in town, the police station,
the hospital

258
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,200
I was hanging on to the phone

259
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,200
Weeping like a fountain

260
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,100
All our guests looked, found nothing...

261
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,900
I couldn't bear to see them return

262
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,600
Then night fell...

263
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,900
You're here, you're here!

264
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,900
My poor Nelly. I saw you and
Martineau, on the river

265
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,600
What of it?

266
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,500
Please, I don't want to talk about it.
I followed you, isn't that enough?

267
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,900
When you landed, was it to play cards?

268
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,700
I saw you... I "saw" you

269
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,900
Saw what? Is that why you
ran off like a maniac?

270
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,300
Why I've been shaking all day,
and you're in this state?

271
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,900
Yes, we landed on the island...

272
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
...because I needed a rest

273
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,900
Lying on the grass

274
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,600
No, standing on one leg!

275
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Look at me, you fool!

276
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,800
Can't you see I love you,
that I'm your wife?

277
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,700
Look at my eyes... it's for you
I've been crying

278
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,800
What if he doesn't come back,
I thought. Without him I'm nothing

279
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,700
No, you don't love me any more.
Leave me alone

280
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,900
If I didn't love you,
I wouldn't be here

281
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,900
I wanted to die, too...
do you hear me?

282
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,200
It hurts so

283
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,600
Hush, it's all over now.
I'm here and I love you

284
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Come on, darling

285
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,500
What are you dreaming?

286
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,500
No, it's over... it's all over

287
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,500
- Back already?
- I haven't time to waste

288
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,200
- Can I christen it?
- Of course

289
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,700
It must have cost

290
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,300
I'll go and change

291
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,900
Sorry, the weekends are fully booked

292
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,700
No. 4 is free. Martineau phoned
to cancel

293
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,600
These shirts won't last another winter

294
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,100
It's full of holes

295
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
When did Martineau call?

296
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,200
I said that for Clothilde's sake.
"I" called "him"

297
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,200
I told him not to come back, right?

298
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,900
This pillowcase has had it

299
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,700
I said he was nice, but
too full of himself

300
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,900
He got the point, all right

301
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,000
What will people think,
you calling him?

302
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,800
That I'm scared and leave
the dirty work...

303
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,600
...to you?

304
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
I couldn't let you suffer

305
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,600
So you make me a laughing-stock?

306
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,000
Martineau's got himself snagged,
for once

307
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,500
He won't say a word

308
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,500
That's what you think

309
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,600
So your love depends on
what people think?

310
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,200
Keep your jewels

311
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,600
Help me

312
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,500
Don't... I was wrong

313
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,600
It won't come off, anyway

314
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,900
Who said you could take my doll?

315
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,200
- You're mean
- You're the nasty one

316
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,900
Your boy's a poet, says it's a train

317
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,900
- What's wrong?
- He took my doll

318
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,900
Children squabbling over their toys?

319
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,200
Just hold it, right there

320
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,500
It's my doll

321
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,900
Couldn't you lend it?

322
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,600
What a pest

323
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,100
It's the magic hour, Monsieur Prieur

324
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,300
Sorry, I've work to do

325
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,500
Where's he off to?

326
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,400
He's so busy, Monsieur Duhamel

327
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,400
Lights, please!

328
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,500
I'll only be a second

329
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,300
Choc-ices, caramels...

330
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,400
Is there much more?

331
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,700
It's the last reel

332
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,200
Look at that zoom!

333
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Pity Martineau's not here

334
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,200
I filmed his garage

335
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,500
A real star turn

336
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,900
You ought to be in films

337
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,400
- That's you!
- Yes, the day mother was ill

338
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,900
Less than I wanted...

339
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,400
...but I couldn't follow them

340
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,000
<i>Have the courage to face the truth</i>

341
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,400
A narrow squeak, my love

342
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,200
You can't come again,
he's watching me

343
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,900
I'll spin a yarn and
we can meet in town

344
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,900
Yes, I'll alert Marilyn

345
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,900
Stop it... yes, of course I want to...

346
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,700
Stop it, for God's sake!

347
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,100
What's got into you?

348
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,600
Don't worry, he'll get over it

349
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,500
Forgive me... forgive me

350
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,000
Proud of yourself?

351
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,200
What will people think?
You don't care, do you?

352
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,900
Duhamel wanted to leave.
He's staying, but not for you

353
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,500
I told him you'd been drinking

354
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,800
Am I entitled to an explanation?

355
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,900
Talk to me, Paul

356
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,600
I'm jealous

357
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,900
Jealous of whom? Of what?

358
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,900
I don't know, but it's killing me

359
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,300
It's killing me

360
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,200
I almost jumped from the window

361
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:02,900
I can't bear to see you like this,
Paul. Hit me if you want

362
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,900
I'd prefer that

363
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,300
But it's inside me, I know that

364
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,900
You're exhausted, my love,
come and get some sleep

365
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,300
You think I can sleep?

366
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,200
Just relax... let yourself go

367
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,200
Have you seen Martineau again?

368
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,300
Oh really, Paul, I was asleep

369
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,600
Have you seen him again?

370
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,600
No, because I called to say
not to come again

371
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,600
Because it's dangerous here

372
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,900
So you see him in town.
That's logical, isn't it?

373
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,900
Yes, it's logical, but it's untrue

374
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,900
Can you prove it?

375
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,500
How can I?

376
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,400
If you won't be reasonable,
let me do it for both of us

377
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,500
It bothers you if I go into town?
Then I won't. Ever

378
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,900
Not ever?

379
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,900
Not ever

380
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,900
Feel better now?

381
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,200
Sort of

382
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,400
- What more can I do?
- It's too late; what's done is done

383
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,600
But what did I do?

384
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,500
You can ask after your island trip?

385
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,200
Not that again. I told you
I was tired and had to rest

386
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,800
- Aren't you drinking too much?
- I'm cold

387
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,200
- I'm cold, too
- You want some?

388
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,000
So you had a rest?

389
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,900
- For half-an-hour?
- No, for five minutes

390
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:37,400
Wrong. You left at 11.30,
I arrived on the stroke of midday

391
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,200
Listen...

392
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,700
One last time. We left at 11.30...

393
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,600
...and had a rest on the island...

394
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:56,500
...that's true, but it was
because I was tired

395
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:01,500
- So you lay down in the grass
- I did not lie down in the grass

396
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,200
You're lying

397
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:13,900
I'm sick of your lies. Come on,
you're going to tell me the truth

398
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,500
All right, so I slept with Martineau...

399
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:23,200
...on the island, in his car, at his
place, on our bed. Now are you happy?

400
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,900
Open up

401
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,100
I was wrong

402
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,700
I'm past that now... I love you

403
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,100
Don't be silly... let me in

404
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,700
Idiot

405
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,500
Got my lambs, boss?

406
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:39,900
I left them at the butcher's. I'll
call him... my head's like a sieve

407
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,600
I'm so sorry

408
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,900
You're leaving? Nothing wrong
at home, I hope

409
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,900
Wrong here, I'd say, with
that row last night

410
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,900
Take their luggage to their car

411
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,600
Anyone can drink too much, but
with a sweet girl like that...

412
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,300
Good morning, all

413
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,900
- How are you, Nelly dear?
- Fine, thanks

414
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,600
I doubt if you slept well

415
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,600
That happens

416
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,200
- Stop it
- I'm an aeroplane

417
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,400
Vincent, please, I've a headache

418
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,400
Make me some bread-and-butter, Dad

419
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,600
Bread-and-butter

420
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,600
Can you take him to his grandmother
later?

421
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,700
Who, me?

422
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,800
Since I can't go out

423
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,600
- Have what you like... on the house
- How nice and how unusual

424
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,700
- Going for a walk?
- Is getting a breath of air forbidden?

425
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,200
I can't see Mum or Marilyn,
or take my son out

426
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,200
For two weeks you've kept
an eye on me

427
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,200
No, I can't take it any more

428
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,900
You want to pick a fight with me,
well, I'll give you cause

429
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:14,300
I don't know how or who with,
but I will

430
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:09,500
Are you saving on lights?
It'll be our pensions next

431
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,900
- The fuses?
- No, it's the region

432
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:18,600
It was the same during the last storm

433
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,800
- Have a drink with us, boss
- Thanks, but I must see to this

434
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,600
It's really no joke... it's been
like this for an hour

435
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,200
- What do they say?
- The number's still engaged

436
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,500
Trust French workers to strike

437
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,600
No, it's a power cut

438
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,700
- Seen my wife?
- Not for a while

439
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,200
Thirty-five minutes I've been
calling you

440
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,700
I know you're busy, but...

441
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,000
Isn't Mum here?

442
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,300
I don't know

443
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:09,400
As you see, just us menfolk

444
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,000
Mama's gone, vanished into the night

445
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,200
Move over, I'll play you something

446
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:22,600
It's good news... I hope

447
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,900
They say it won't be long now

448
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,900
Vanished into the night...
providential night

449
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,200
- Won't you come in?
- Is this really the moment?

450
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,300
- You're always so rushed
- Yes, I'm always rushed

451
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,900
- About time, too
- Sorry, I can't be everywhere

452
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,700
Is my husband coming soon?

453
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,800
I saw you sniggering together

454
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,300
He didn't say

455
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,600
- Oh, sorry, sir!
- What's wrong?

456
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,500
It's our customers...
they have wandering hands

457
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,300
- You startled me
- What were you doing in there?

458
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:10,900
A candle for the new guest, the
captain. What a night to arrive

459
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,400
- Why did you go in?
- He asked me to

460
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,900
- You didn't with the others
- Yes, but he was in bed

461
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,900
I wasn't to know. It's no better,
is it?

462
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,900
- What was he doing in bed?
- Waiting for me

463
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,300
Isn't it over, Paul?

464
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,900
You're right, it's stupid

465
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,300
I love you

466
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,200
You'd better hurry, Monsieur Chabert

467
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,400
- Your wife will be grumbling
- I'm used to that

468
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,600
Clothilde, send Vincent up for supper

469
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:10,900
You've got candle grease on
your skirt... on the back

470
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,300
I must have done that in the cellar

471
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,900
- You went to the cellar?
- Yes, to check the fuses

472
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,900
- Julien said he did that
- We had the same idea

473
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:13,300
- Now my ceiling's wet. What a country!
- The idiots didn't close the skylights

474
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,000
<i>They're all after her</i>

475
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,900
Were you in the loft today?

476
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,400
No, why?

477
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,200
You're lying

478
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,200
Think carefully: Were you
in the loft today?

479
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,500
Oh yes, looking for lamps

480
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,200
- Alone
- Yes, alone

481
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,200
You're lying. Where's your bracelet?

482
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,900
- What bracelet?
- The one I gave you

483
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,100
- Lost
- When?

484
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,500
I don't know, a day or two ago

485
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,500
Liar

486
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,800
You're lying. I found it in the loft

487
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,900
Where is it?

488
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,600
- You're pathetic
- Be quiet

489
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,900
Every time you open your mouth
you lie

490
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,300
Yes, I lie, because I'm
sick of your scenes...

491
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,200
...worrying what to say
or not to say

492
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,700
Don't touch me

493
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,400
I'll say anything to end
your questions

494
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:20,400
Yes, I lie and I couldn't care less

495
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,800
You hate me? Go on, say you hate me

496
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:33,000
If I had money enough for Vincent
and my mother, I'd leave you

497
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,100
I can't believe that.
Is that why you stayed?

498
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,700
Why do you think I married you?

499
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,300
I don't believe that...
I can't believe you there

500
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,100
I'm sorry, but I'm all out.
Go to sleep

501
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,600
Yes, it's Paul

502
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:50,000
- Congratulations, the bird has flown
- What bird?

503
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,300
What on earth has got into you?

504
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,400
You're rich, so you can screw
the innkeeper's wife?

505
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,800
Try to calm down. Where is your wife?

506
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:09,600
You're asking me? What's "that," then?

507
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:15,600
That's nothing, just Lenoir...

508
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:24,100
...joining me for a game of cards
after dinner. Be serious, man

509
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,000
Don't make a joke of it

510
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:33,900
You've all taken advantage of me long
enough. Tomorrow: Everyone out!

511
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,200
You're really beginning to
get up my nose

512
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:46,700
First thing tomorrow I'm off,
and I won't be back

513
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,600
Now get out

514
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:59,700
If I ever kill myself,
it'll be on your conscience

515
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,900
Paul, don't play the fool

516
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,900
Be reasonable

517
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,800
Where have you been?

518
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,900
Me? Where have "you" been?

519
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,100
I was letting the cat in

520
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,400
Seeing Duhamel on the way

521
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,400
I know; I was there just now

522
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,900
You're crazy, Paul

523
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:37,600
You want every last one of them,
don't you? Old, young, employees

524
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:46,900
I have my rights, I'm going to
exercise them now

525
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,300
Stop it, Paul, please

526
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,400
<i>Forget the sweet talk</i>

527
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,600
<i>Don'tlisten to the tart</i>

528
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,400
Bitch!

529
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:52,300
I know she came here because she left
this on my pillow. You're hiding her

530
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,600
Sit down

531
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:59,300
You could be held responsible
for her desertion

532
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:03,000
I could have you charged

533
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,400
Come and sit down

534
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:19,600
I mustn't be angry, but if she
leaves me I have nothing

535
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,100
I can't live without her

536
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,800
Stay calm

537
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,600
Please give her back, Doctor

538
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,100
Come, Nelly, don't be afraid

539
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,800
What do I owe you for your labours?

540
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,400
Stop joking. You hurt Nelly...

541
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,700
...and I had to examine her

542
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,600
You've had your fill, I see

543
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:55,500
Go on like this and I'll
have you locked up

544
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:01,700
She's sick and I get locked up.
That's a good one

545
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:09,000
Don't get the idea that
I'll take this lying down

546
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,900
You may not think so,
but I know my rights

547
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,700
Arbitrary sequestration,
that's not on

548
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,200
Do you get me?

549
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:23,300
Don't you realize she's lying
to both of us?

550
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,500
She's a born liar

551
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,300
You beat her, Paul

552
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,500
I slapped her once in
six years of marriage

553
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:35,600
She asked for it,
and I'll do it again

554
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,600
You nearly maimed her

555
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,600
You have no idea what I went through

556
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:52,300
At first I believed her,
but then realized...

557
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,200
...and forgave her

558
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,400
But getting out of bed to meet lovers
in the attic, that's unforgiveable

559
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,300
What is one supposed to do?

560
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:12,300
It took me a long time to catch her,
because she's cunning

561
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,800
She'd pretend to sleep...

562
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:19,300
...but I'd programme myself
to wake up

563
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,700
Her feet would feel frozen

564
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,600
Proof she'd been up, see?

565
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,700
But, Doctor...

566
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,300
Quiet, let him talk;
this is interesting

567
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,300
It's not her fault. She loves me
in her way

568
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:45,300
But when the fit takes her,
it's anywhere and with anyone

569
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,000
She is sick

570
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:53,300
Just look at her... it's
undermining her health

571
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,900
It's hysteria

572
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,700
She's hysterical

573
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:10,000
Maybe you find this hard to believe?

574
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,300
No, I believe you, Paul

575
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,700
But it's monstrous... he is mad

576
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:25,500
There's your proof: Now she
wants me locked up

577
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,900
Yes, this demands immediate attention

578
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,100
See? What did I tell you?

579
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,000
- I'm calling the clinic
- Clinic? What for?

580
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,300
She needs a psychiatrist

581
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,400
Dumesnil? Arnoux here. I've a case
for you, same as last week

582
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:54,200
The husband's told me
a very revealing story

583
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,400
You understand? Yes, it's urgent

584
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,800
Really urgent

585
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,600
I'll bring them both tomorrow

586
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:13,000
Neither of us is going to any clinic

587
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,300
It's tough, Nelly, but
there's no other way

588
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I'll protect you, Nelly.
They can't force us

589
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,900
I'll call for you,
seven tomorrow morning

590
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,600
I'll set the alarm for six

591
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,700
If it makes you happy

592
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,700
It doesn't, but we're getting up early

593
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,300
Look at this

594
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,000
Maybe I could give you another chance

595
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,500
I forgive you

596
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,800
It'll be like before

597
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,900
But be careful

598
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:12,800
I'll be severe; any lapse
and you're under lock and key

599
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,100
Can I have two sleeping pills?

600
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,700
Sleeping pills? Why two?

601
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,600
I need sleep. So do you

602
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,800
I need advice from no one

603
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,800
Do as you like, then

604
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,100
He told you not to upset me?

605
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:58,900
- Who?
- Arnoux

606
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,300
No, I've been here since
this afternoon

607
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,800
You could have telephoned

608
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:11,300
You can ask Clothilde if you like.
Come on, let's wake her

609
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,800
It was I who locked it

610
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,700
Do you mind?

611
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,000
Mind if I take precautions?

612
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:32,300
In case you start prowling
the bedrooms again

613
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:39,100
I know what your game is,
begging me to go to sleep

614
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:46,100
Listen, Paul... Vincent is feverish,
I must go to him

615
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,300
Will you let me out?

616
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,400
I'll give you two minutes

617
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,700
Give me the key now

618
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,200
The key, or I'll yell

619
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,100
One step and I yell for help

620
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,300
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

621
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,900
Give it to me

622
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,200
Poor Nelly, Arnoux was right

623
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,300
You're not normal

624
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,300
I'm waiting

625
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,000
Well played!

626
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
We'll see about this

627
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:05,300
You should trust me.
I wasn't long, was I?

628
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,700
Want to know about Vincent?

629
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,900
- Is Vincent all right?
- Yes, Vincent is all right

630
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,800
Don't sulk. Can I have the key back?

631
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,300
Listen, I'm tired

632
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:23,000
So you won't mind me locking up.
I'd feel safer

633
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:29,300
- Didn't I take my sleeping pills?
- Seems not. Can I have it back?

634
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,700
The key!

635
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:40,300
All right, I'll sleep in the armchair,
in front of the door

636
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:43,500
That'll leave you fresh
for leaving early

637
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,000
I won't be going

638
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:50,300
- You're leaving me to go alone?
- Don't worry, you're not going either

639
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,400
- But if I'm ill...
- Home remedies suit your illness best

640
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,800
A good beating will do it

641
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,400
You can enjoy stripping off
for the doctors next time

642
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,600
Arnoux can lump it

643
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,200
You can tell him tomorrow

644
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,300
No, because I won't be seeing him

645
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,300
Telephone's confiscated

646
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,000
- Are you scared?
- I'm not scared

647
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:26,600
I'm neither mad nor a monster;
get that into your head

648
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,600
I know, Paul

649
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,700
Then why try to call a doctor
at this hour?

650
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,600
I can't take any more

651
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,700
A great fiddle, that clinic

652
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:42,300
I'm talking to you.
Did you think I'd go?

653
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:48,800
Fell for it, didn't you? But
you won't get me; I'll fight

654
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:54,300
First, give me that key. Where is
that key, for God's sake?

655
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,300
Where is that key, for God's sake?

656
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,400
In the corridor, under the statuette

657
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,300
<i>She's been telling fibs</i>

658
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:30,700
<i>"Doctor"... "they're here. He's shut us"
in, the key's under the carpet</i>

659
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,300
<i>He's mad. I'll let them in
when he falls asleep</i>

660
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:48,800
<i>Wild beasts should be trussed</i>

661
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,600
So you want to let them in?

662
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,900
You asked for it, slut!

663
01:30:54,400 --> 01:31:00,100
<i>Doctor? He's tied me up. Come quickly
and break the door down</i>

664
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:28,300
My poor darling

665
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:38,300
Wake up, my love. It's six o'clock...
do you hear?

666
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,600
I'm so sleepy

667
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:48,300
You can sleep in the car. We can't
waste any more time. Come on, baby

668
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,700
Open your eyes. Arnoux will be
here soon

669
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:56,700
What happened?

670
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,800
Nothing. Come on

671
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,600
It's dark. I'm scared when it rains

672
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:11,000
Yes, it's raining, but don't worry,
I'll drive carefully. We must hurry

673
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,300
Wipe your face, it'll waken you up.
I'll run a bath for you

674
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,300
Get a move on, my love

675
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,300
Don't push me, let me get used to it

676
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,600
Why are you looking at me as if
you'd never seen me before?

677
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:53,600
I haven't, not like today.
It's been so long, like a dream

678
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,800
If only that were true

679
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,700
It is true

680
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,600
Isn't it obvious?

681
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:06,600
It's been so long... I thought
everything was lost

682
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,400
There's nothing to cry about

683
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,700
I'm not... I'm happy and
I'm not crying

684
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:21,200
We'll start all over again

685
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:25,000
- Wait till I get back from Clermont
- You really want to go now?

686
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,100
You bet, as soon as possible

687
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,600
It's true, Paul

688
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,300
I can't wait to be safe

689
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,600
<i>Your wound has reopened</i>

690
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,400
"Look"...

691
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,100
But I'd untied her

692
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,900
What's happening to me?

693
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:56,100
We were on the point of leaving
for the clinic at Clermont...

694
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,300
...both of us

695
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,100
But we're still here

696
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,100
It's like before

697
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,700
Like before what?

698
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,400
I no longer know... I'm lost

699
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,600
I only hope she isn't thinking of...

700
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,100
I must get my ideas straight...

701
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:38,100
Must be careful... mustn't...

702
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,600
...if I should ever...

703
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,400
Let me see...

704
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,400
WITHOUT END

705
01:36:00,305 --> 01:37:00,332
