I uh...

3
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:32,527
Uh, he was asking if we have
any family left in Romania.

4
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,094
You don't speak Romanian?

5
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:37,164
Um, no, I don't. Sorry.

6
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,571
Hey, easy.

7
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,210
What did he say?

8
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,412
He said he hates you.

9
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,682
No, no, no, I say
you are beautiful.

10
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:57,184
<i>- Frumoasa.

00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,962
Thank you.

13
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,166
Oh...

14
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,380
Is this it?

15
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:28,616
Uh... I think so.

16
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,535
Julia.

17
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:12,093
Hey, not bad.

18
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,602
Hm, it's from work.

19
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,041
You don't like?

20
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,744
No. No, it's lovely.

21
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,047
Um... <i>frumoas...</i>

<i>- Frumoasa.
- Frumoasa.</i>

23
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,879
I smell like plane.

24
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,915
Oh, well, that's my favorite.

25
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,250
Stale peanuts and
sweaty strangers.

26
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,486
Why did she think I
didn't like the place?

27
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,156
Because you smile too much.

28
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,992
Are you telling me that I walk
around grinning like an idiot?

29
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,160
Only around me.

30
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,633
Mm... you're insufferable.

31
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:45,438
Can't sleep?

32
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:49,977
No.

33
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,047
Sorry if I woke you.

34
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,248
Come here.

35
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,126
When do you have to
wake up tomorrow?

36
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,395
Early.

37
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,463
Wake me up before
you leave, okay?

38
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,066
Okay.

39
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:15,468
I will.

40
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:23,476
Oh...

Sorry.

Hello, darling.

Any reason in particular
you're standing in the dark?

63
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,953
Just people watching.

64
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,457
How was work?

65
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:12,026
Exhausting.

66
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:14,629
But good.

67
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:21,935
Is this for me?

68
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:23,672
It's for you.

69
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:26,675
It's kind of silly.

70
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,176
Yes.

71
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,647
It is. Very silly.

72
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,015
And I love it.

73
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,328
For you.

74
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:48,896
What is it?

75
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:53,033
It's a... It's a symbol.

76
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,902
A symbol of what?

77
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,471
That spring has arrived.

78
00:13:57,806 --> 00:14:00,007
Isn't it obvious?

79
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:24,865
What's happening?

80
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:31,740
They're not sure.

81
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,876
- Hey.
- Hey, come look at this.

82
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,339
I think this is what we
passed by the other night.

83
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,385
What are they saying?

84
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,758
They're talking about the
last time she was seen.

85
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,460
- She was murdered?
- So it seems.

86
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,999
That guy was there.
What is he saying?

87
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,335
He found the body.

88
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,037
How did she, uh...

89
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:41,509
They didn't say.

90
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,246
They're gonna be here at 7:00.

91
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,484
Okay.

92
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,187
I can't figure out
if Simion likes me

93
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,089
or if he thinks I'm an idiot.

94
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:58,636
I swear, every time I think
I'm getting in with him,

95
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,728
he shuts the door in
my face like I'm...

96
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:03,865
fuckin' Diane Keaton at
the end of <i>The Godfather.</i>

97
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,706
Hey.

98
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,809
What?

99
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,311
What's up?

100
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,547
Nothing.

101
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,323
There's this guy that
lives across the street,

102
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,793
and he's always
looking over here.

103
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,395
Looking in over here how?

104
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:39,166
Every time I look over
there, he's just...

105
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,400
standing in his window

106
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,169
and it's like he's
staring right at me.

107
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,372
Which window is it?

108
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:53,982
Right there.

109
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,889
- I can't see anything.
- Because it's day.

110
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,525
He only looks in at night?

111
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,359
I can only see him at night.

112
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:08,028
Doesn't mean that he's not...

113
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,265
You know what? Forget it.

114
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,100
No. Come on.

115
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:15,445
If you're feeling
uncomfortable about something,

116
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,638
we should talk about it.

117
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:18,272
Really. I'm fine.

118
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,876
So you're Diane Keaton now?

119
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,879
Mm-hm. That's
exactly what I said.

120
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:41,328
I'm... I'm sorry, I was just
telling your husband that

121
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,864
he needs some new accounts.

122
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,566
What else do they have you on?

123
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,400
Uh... Frosty Cakes,

124
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,402
and some company that
sells office supplies

125
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,805
marketed towards women.

126
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,240
You just need to make a
better impression on Simion.

127
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,818
Oh, that's a really
good idea. Thank you.

128
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,109
I hadn't thought of that.

129
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,146
And don't confuse
<i>chinui</i> with <i>se chinui.</i>

130
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,916
What happened?

131
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,652
Nothing, I just made this
silly mistake earlier

132
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:05,920
during a presentation

133
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:08,022
and I'm never gonna
hear the end of it.

134
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:09,757
He was trying to say to a client

135
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,992
that he'd fight for them,

136
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:12,827
but instead he said
he'd torture them.

137
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,335
Oh, uh, is it okay
if I smoke in here?

138
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,572
Uh, well, Julia gave up
smoking a few months ago.

139
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,674
Really? I don't see
you as a smoker.

140
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,241
I'm trying not to be.

141
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,612
- I... I don't have to.
- No. No, really.

142
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,046
It's totally fine.

143
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,423
I don't want to be
a bad influence.

144
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,382
- No, it... it's fine.
- All right. Thanks.

145
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,150
Francis told us
you're an actress.

146
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,988
Oh, um, yeah. I... I was.

147
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,990
Um...

148
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,758
Wasn't really for me,

149
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,628
so I'm, um, reevaluating.

150
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:50,865
Uh, Jules and I had an interesting
experience the other night, didn't we?

151
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,141
We were walking just
a few blocks away,

152
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,134
we go past this crime
scene, a bunch of cops.

153
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,207
This afternoon, we turn on
the news and there it is.

154
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,073
- What happened?
- -They found a woman murdered in her apartment.

155
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:01,809
Yeah, you heard about it too?

156
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:09,182
Bullshit.

157
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,621
What?

158
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,894
Do I need to leave so
the grownups can talk?

159
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,730
They're saying the woman
had her head cut off.

160
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,884
- You didn't tell me that.
- They didn't say anything about that.

161
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,403
It must be related
to the other attacks.

162
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,406
So, uh, they found a
woman about a month ago

163
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,174
with her throat slit
in her apartment

164
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,510
around the same age.

165
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:38,112
So, but this one,
he cut so deep,

166
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:40,114
it was essentially
a decapitation.

167
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:41,816
They're calling him The Spider.

168
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,263
- Do you need help?
- No, no, no, I'm fine.

169
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,086
<i>Scuzi.</i>

170
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,056
You must be the new neighbor.

171
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,324
Oh, yeah.

172
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,093
- You two just moved in, right?
- Yeah.

173
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:00,895
Can you hear me?

174
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:03,765
Um, yes, your
English is perfect.

175
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:05,432
Thank you, but I meant

176
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,865
can you hear me
inside my apartment?

177
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:09,904
Oh, um... no. Not really.

178
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,005
Hm.

179
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,907
Can you hear us?

180
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,576
No. You are
suspiciously quiet.

181
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,477
And I love you for this.

182
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,479
- I'm Irina.
- Julia.

183
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:23,084
Just bang on my wall if I'm
ever making too much noise.

184
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:24,417
Okay.

185
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,004
<i>I woke up and saw a man
standing over me in the dark.</i>

186
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:18,739
<i>He put a pillow
case over my head</i>

187
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,174
<i>so I couldn't see his face.</i>

188
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,679
<i>He held a knife to my
throat and pressed down.</i>

189
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:27,347
<i>I thought I was going to die</i>

190
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,684
<i>because I felt it
going into my skin.</i>

191
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:31,185
<i>But then he stopped</i>

192
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,254
<i>and just sat next
to me, watching me.</i>

193
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:36,724
<i>It felt like he was
there for hours.</i>

194
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:44,364
<i>I think he was
watching me before.</i>

195
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,200
<i>I just had a sense that...</i>

196
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:49,770
<i>someone was always behind me,</i>

197
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:52,405
<i>even when I was alone.</i>

198
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,791
<i>Where is it, lady?</i>

199
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:17,959
<i>I don't know.</i>

200
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:23,230
<i>Give it to me.</i>

201
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:26,334
<i>- It's mine!
- No!</i>

202
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:30,304
<i>Peter! Peter!</i>

203
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:32,206
<i>A man tried to kill me!</i>

204
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:58,199
<i>Peter?</i>

205
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:01,402
<i>Peter?</i>

206
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,638
<i>Peter, are you all right?</i>

207
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:09,910
<i>Lock the door. Don't
let anyone in except me.</i>

208
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:11,679
<i>And close these
windows after me.</i>

209
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,514
<i>Be careful.</i>

210
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:15,783
<i>You just took the words
right out of my mouth.</i>

211
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,576
Uh... Marlboro.

212
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:56,624
Uh, no, I'm... I'm
good. Thank you.

213
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:23,771
Hey!

214
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:27,274
Is... Is there a back door?

215
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:36,793
Simion says they
like to be wooed,

216
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,520
so we're going to
headquarters in Sofia

217
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:40,020
to do the whole song and dance.

218
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:42,569
I don't know yet if it's
gonna be Nicolae or me.

219
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:45,527
That's great.

220
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,297
You're not hungry?

221
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,268
Uh... not really.

222
00:28:57,706 --> 00:29:00,341
This, uh, weird thing happened.

223
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:03,511
Um... there was this guy
at the movie theater,

224
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:06,413
and then he...

225
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:08,282
followed me into
the supermarket.

226
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:12,419
Followed you?

227
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:14,421
Yeah.

228
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,010
Did he say something to you?

229
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,828
Uh, no.

230
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,329
No.

231
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,835
Did he follow you here?

232
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,937
No, I don't think so.

233
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,349
You okay?

234
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,085
Yeah.

235
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,955
I think I just need
to sleep it off.

236
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:51,526
Come here.

237
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:56,163
The good news is, if
he ever comes here,

238
00:29:56,598 --> 00:29:58,832
you have your big strong
man to protect you.

239
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:02,202
Okay.

240
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:05,674
I'm gonna pretend you
didn't just laugh at that.

241
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:15,684
I'm sorry.

242
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,054
No, um...

243
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:23,123
No, you... You don't
have to apologize.

244
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:24,597
I don't know why I
reacted like that.

245
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:27,161
No, no, I... I totally get it.

246
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,535
Do you want to go back
to the supermarket?

247
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:36,003
I mean, they gotta have
security tapes, right?

248
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:58,703
He thought you were
trying to steal.

249
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:00,170
Oh, I wasn't trying
to steal something.

250
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,929
There was a man that
was following me,

251
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:03,197
I was just trying to hide.

252
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:13,675
Uh, what time were you in?

253
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,677
Uh, around four, I think.

254
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:26,053
What'd he look like?

255
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:28,222
Uh, he was white,

256
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:30,391
mm, older.

257
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,292
He was wearing a brown jacket.

258
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,432
No.

259
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,985
That's him.

260
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,395
Oh, okay, watch.

261
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,172
Wait for it.

262
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:25,279
Just wait.

263
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:30,250
There. See?

264
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:38,425
He's staring right at me.

265
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,995
Maybe, or...

266
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:44,632
Or what?

267
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,469
Or he's staring at the
woman who's staring at him.

268
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:41,823
You gonna be okay?

269
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:44,526
Of course. I'll be fine.

270
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,705
I have to go to dinner
with some clients tonight,

271
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,096
so I'm gonna be
out kind of late.

272
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:51,699
Okay.

273
00:33:58,506 --> 00:33:59,741
Bye.

274
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:52,092
Hey.

275
00:34:54,194 --> 00:34:56,263
I was just wondering when
you're gonna be back home.

276
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,267
Yeah, I figured.

277
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:03,403
Do you know when you'll be back?

278
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,941
No, it's just, um...

279
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:12,446
No, it's fine. Um, it's fine.

280
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:16,751
Yeah, I'll see you
when you're back.

281
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,090
You too.

282
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:58,186
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

283
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:11,866
I...

284
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,503
- Elvis?
- Elvis.

285
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:18,539
It's her cat.

286
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:22,110
- What?
- Elvis is her cat.

287
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,249
He's gone missing and
she's trying to find him,

288
00:37:24,277 --> 00:37:25,913
and she wants to know
if you've seen him.

289
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,483
Uh, I'm sorry, I...
I haven't seen him.

290
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:31,619
Oh...

291
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:47,702
Poor Eleonora. That cat is
always trying to escape her.

292
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:49,804
Thanks, by the way.

293
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:52,372
My husband usually
translates, but...

294
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:53,440
still at work.

295
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,243
Working at 10 p.m.?

296
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,611
Is he a stripper?

297
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:58,880
No, no, works in marketing.

298
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:00,413
- With a client.
- Mm.

299
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:04,752
Do you feel like
coming in for a drink?

300
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,755
I feel like another
one, and it's less sad

301
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,422
if there's another
person with me.

302
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:11,025
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah?

303
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:12,425
Sure. Yeah. That sounds nice.

304
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:13,493
Okay.

305
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:24,605
Come in.

306
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:33,714
I should have stayed out longer.

307
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:35,883
I look radiant with vodka.

308
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,323
Do you like port?

309
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,026
Yeah. Sure.

310
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:50,631
<i>- Noroc.
- Noroc.</i>

311
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:55,503
See? You do.

312
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:57,705
I'm trying to learn.

313
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:00,508
I wanted to surprise Francis.

314
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:03,410
One day, just say
something very casually.

315
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:06,013
So your husband's Romanian?

316
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:08,883
Uh, his mother is but
he grew up in the US.

317
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:13,420
And he brought you back
to the home country.

318
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:15,455
Yeah. Got a promotion,

319
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:18,159
and they needed someone
in the Bucharest office.

320
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:21,229
It must be hard for you, though.

321
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:24,866
It was hard for me when
I first moved away.

322
00:39:25,465 --> 00:39:28,536
I studied ballet in London
before I injured my knee.

323
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:30,571
My English was terrible.

324
00:39:30,905 --> 00:39:32,773
I fell madly in love
with it eventually,

325
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,710
but the first few months,
I was terribly lonely.

326
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:37,545
Yeah, me too.

327
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,379
Definitely be lonely.

328
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:41,883
At least you have
your husband with you.

329
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:47,121
I'm sorry, did I say
something to upset you?

330
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:49,023
- No.
- Are you sure?

331
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:53,194
Irina.

332
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,210
Is everything okay?

333
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:11,379
Yeah. It's just my ex.

334
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:14,715
He sounds kind of scary.

335
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:17,018
Yeah, he just sounds like that.

336
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:18,119
It's all a show.

337
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:21,289
He's actually very sweet.

338
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:24,659
Anyway, he knows not
to cross the line.

339
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:25,960
And what if he does?

340
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:31,632
I'm serious.

341
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:35,468
Open it.

342
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,010
Whoa.

343
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:45,212
He gave it to me as a
present when we were together

344
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:46,781
to defend myself.

345
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,950
I think he regrets
it now but, uh,

346
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:50,418
it just makes it easier for me

347
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,953
to tell him to go fuck himself.

348
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:54,288
I should tell more people
to go fuck themselves.

349
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:55,790
- You should.
- Mm-hm.

350
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,359
You should say...

351
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,231
Perfect!

352
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,539
Fuck this.

353
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:33,220
You're not really
looking in here, are you?

354
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:32,480
Jules?

355
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,015
What's goin' on?

356
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,889
I saw the man in
the window again.

357
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:21,662
I waved at him.

358
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,234
And he waved back.

359
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:40,047
Which one is it?

360
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:42,349
One floor up to the left.

361
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,621
His light's off.

362
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:48,055
He's in there.

363
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:51,560
Don't...

364
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:00,501
Do you see him?

365
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,774
No, I can't see anything.

366
00:45:06,974 --> 00:45:08,409
It's too dark.

367
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:10,344
I want to call the cops.

368
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:12,713
- Is that really necessary?
- Yes.

369
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:15,849
So he followed you
from the theater

370
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,519
across the street to the market?

371
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:19,954
I think so.

372
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:22,223
You think so?

373
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,867
Mm-hm. Can you
describe him please?

374
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:35,604
I have a photo.

375
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:43,410
So you think this is the same
man you saw in the window?

376
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:44,912
I think it could be.

377
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,148
You could identify
his face in a window

378
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:49,783
in the building
across the street?

379
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:52,253
Not exactly.

380
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:55,089
It was dark. It was
his silhouette mostly.

381
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:58,392
- Mostly?
- Look, this isn't normal.

382
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:01,663
He's always there
looking in here.

383
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:05,899
I... I can feel him.

384
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:07,768
Okay. Okay, okay.

385
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:10,104
I'll go over there, see if
he's looking in the window.

386
00:46:10,137 --> 00:46:12,574
That's not polite, so...
I'll talk with him.

387
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,542
If you want, you
can come with me,

388
00:46:14,576 --> 00:46:16,877
see if it's the same
man as in the picture,

389
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,581
so I think so can
become yes or no.

390
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:22,416
I don't think
that's a good idea.

391
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:24,852
I'll go.

392
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:27,288
I'd like to get a look at him.

393
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:29,923
Maybe I could just hang back,

394
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:31,437
get a glance of him
around the corner.

395
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:33,127
Right?

396
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:35,296
Yeah, sure.

397
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,026
Was it him?

398
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:48,202
Francis, was it him?

399
00:47:52,406 --> 00:47:55,008
Listen to me for a second.
Even if it was him,

400
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,378
the guy lives in
our neighborhood.

401
00:47:57,645 --> 00:48:00,948
It's not crazy to think that he'd
be shopping at the same store.

402
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:04,619
I need you to stop
rationalizing this all away.

403
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:09,022
You want me to stop
being rational?

404
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:12,426
To just jump to the craziest
conclusion like you?

405
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,261
You think I'm crazy?

406
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:16,964
No, I think...

407
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,465
I think you're stressed,

408
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:20,367
and you're alone
here all day long...

409
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:21,746
- Stop.
- You're in this new country...

410
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,970
Stop!

411
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:26,273
Stop talking to me like
I'm a fucking child.

412
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:38,686
I can't... I can't stay here.

413
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,655
Julia.

414
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:42,489
I want to leave.

415
00:48:42,524 --> 00:48:44,859
Leave, like pack
our bags right now?

416
00:48:44,893 --> 00:48:47,027
You want to head to
a hotel or... or,

417
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,229
what, you want to get on
a plane back to New York?

418
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:52,600
Please, just tell me
what you want me to do?

419
00:48:52,634 --> 00:48:54,501
I want you to
fucking believe me!

420
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:55,904
God.

421
00:48:57,971 --> 00:48:59,774
This is just a bad night, Jules.

422
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:01,843
It's not a bad night.

423
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:07,281
I can't think here,
I can't breathe,

424
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:10,484
I mean, I... I feel
like I'm losing my mind.

425
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:15,523
What... What can I do?

426
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,991
What can I do to help?

427
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:27,167
Nothing.

428
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:56,129
Hey, Jules, I'm headin' out.

429
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:37,719
Do you speak English?

430
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:39,887
Yes.

431
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:42,456
What is this place?

432
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:45,258
Museum.

433
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:48,228
It's a museum?

434
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:50,965
No. Museum, it's a club.

435
00:53:53,935 --> 00:53:55,870
- Can I go in?
- Yeah, sure.

436
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:21,889
Julia?

437
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:28,296
You followed him here?

438
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:32,900
Francis thinks that
I'm overreacting.

439
00:55:33,201 --> 00:55:35,136
But he's been watching
us since we moved in.

440
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:38,471
Do you know him?

441
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:40,340
I think he works
here as a cleaner.

442
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:42,310
People come and go
here all the time.

443
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:44,645
I never really get a
good look at their faces.

444
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:47,081
They all have the
same dumb expression,

445
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:48,549
and they start to
blend together.

446
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:52,086
Have you noticed anyone
watching you in your apartment?

447
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:54,989
No.

448
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:57,191
But maybe I've gotten
used to having eyes on me.

449
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:04,665
Do I just sound paranoid?

450
00:56:06,334 --> 00:56:08,102
Let's just hope
you'll never find out.

451
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:10,437
The best outcome might be

452
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,273
having to live with
the uncertainty.

453
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:15,877
Better than getting
raped and strangled,

454
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:18,646
and dying with the words "I told
you so" on your lips. Right?

455
00:56:22,817 --> 00:56:24,719
Sorry. I have to
get back to work.

456
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:31,959
Thank you for looking after me.

457
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:35,129
I'll try and do
the same for you.

458
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:53,868
Irina?

459
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:57,271
Irina?

460
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,874
Irina?

461
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:08,482
I heard yelling. I heard
screaming from in here, okay?

462
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:10,618
- If we can just get the key.

463
00:59:10,885 --> 00:59:12,453
He's hurting her, okay?

464
00:59:12,486 --> 00:59:13,988
Can we get the key, please?

465
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:17,391
Just open the door, please!

466
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:39,280
I heard the scream
from the bedroom.

467
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:02,269
It was cat.

468
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:14,615
Elvis. Elvis.

469
01:00:39,006 --> 01:00:40,441
What did she say?

470
01:00:40,774 --> 01:00:43,512
She said she didn't want
tenants who created trouble.

471
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:47,616
I can imagine.

472
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:54,488
I'm sorry I've been
working so much.

473
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:56,625
It's your job.

474
01:00:57,191 --> 01:00:59,960
I know but you moved
here to be with me.

475
01:01:00,361 --> 01:01:02,496
Well, that's presumptuous.

476
01:01:03,164 --> 01:01:05,499
Maybe I've always wanted to live

477
01:01:05,534 --> 01:01:07,768
an aimless existence
in Bucharest

478
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:09,003
smoking cigarettes

479
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:12,173
and scaring my neighbors
with my hysterics.

480
01:01:12,373 --> 01:01:14,509
You thought she needed help.
I don't blame you for it.

481
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:20,447
I gotta go into work
for a few hours today,

482
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:22,716
but we have cocktails tonight.

483
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:26,353
- If you're up for it.
- Yeah, I'm good.

484
01:01:32,026 --> 01:01:33,761
Hi. <i>Vorbesti engleza?</i>

485
01:01:33,794 --> 01:01:36,197
I was wondering if you know
a woman that works there?

486
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,766
Her name's Irina. She
didn't come home last night

487
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,001
and I was just wondering
if you've heard from her

488
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:42,236
or seen her?

489
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:48,742
Okay. All right. Thank you.

490
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:01,922
Are you looking for Irina?

491
01:02:03,558 --> 01:02:04,758
You know where she is?

492
01:02:05,226 --> 01:02:07,461
No, I just saw her
last night at work.

493
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:11,098
We were supposed to meet at my
apartment after she finished.

494
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:13,767
She never came?

495
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:18,540
It's not the first time,
but, no, she never came.

496
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:20,675
Do you know where she would be?

497
01:02:20,709 --> 01:02:22,109
I think she's inside.

498
01:02:22,843 --> 01:02:24,555
I don't think so. I would
have heard her come in.

499
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:26,213
Do you have her phone number?

500
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:28,749
Yeah, but... she
doesn't answer me.

501
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:30,784
Do you mind if I
try and call her?

502
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,786
Yeah.

503
01:02:48,802 --> 01:02:50,739
Mm-hm. You hear that?

504
01:03:00,147 --> 01:03:01,248
Wait.

505
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:06,353
Could you help me
with something?

506
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,075
So you want me to
knock on his door

507
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:29,877
and get the guy to come out?

508
01:03:30,911 --> 01:03:33,047
Yeah, I just need to see him.

509
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:35,916
Why?

510
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:37,851
I think that he's
been following me.

511
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,887
The police say they
can't do anything,

512
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,123
but I need to know for myself
that it's the same person.

513
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:45,893
Fucking cops are useless.

514
01:03:57,204 --> 01:03:58,506
So which one?

515
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,975
Hm... that's the corner.

516
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:05,580
That one there.

517
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:07,582
Four doors down.

518
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:09,483
On the left?

519
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,085
Yeah.

520
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:35,610
I think there is someone inside.

521
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,945
But they don't answer.

522
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:50,424
Uh, sorry, I gotta go.

523
01:04:51,492 --> 01:04:53,060
Can you just try one more time?

524
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:55,963
Okay.

525
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,988
Sorry. I tried.

526
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,924
Wh... What did you say?

527
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:27,161
Uh...

528
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:28,996
To stop bothering you.

529
01:05:29,564 --> 01:05:30,799
But don't worry.

530
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:33,167
He probably has a
little crush on you.

531
01:05:36,704 --> 01:05:39,507
Um, if you see Irina,

532
01:05:40,073 --> 01:05:41,609
can you tell her that I came by?

533
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:44,144
Okay.

534
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:55,349
I'm sorry. Sorry.

535
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,048
Julia?

536
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:23,236
Julia, this is Daniel Weber.

537
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,673
He lives in the building
across from you.

538
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:30,277
Mr. Weber made a
complaint with us today

539
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:32,747
about a neighbor who
has been harassing him.

540
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,949
- Harassing him?
- Yeah.

541
01:08:34,983 --> 01:08:37,719
Looking at his window,
following him around,

542
01:08:37,752 --> 01:08:40,420
showing up at his door and
threatening his father.

543
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:43,625
And I remember Mr. Weber
from your complaint,

544
01:08:43,658 --> 01:08:47,227
and I wanted to resolve this
before it goes any further.

545
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:52,165
So if you both can agree that
this was misunderstanding,

546
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,369
and, uh, that's not
gonna go any further,

547
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:57,505
we can all go on with our lives.

548
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:41,214
Let me know when they're gone.

549
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:55,663
You okay?

550
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:02,937
I saw this today.

551
01:10:08,543 --> 01:10:09,811
What is this?

552
01:10:09,844 --> 01:10:11,378
It says they caught The Spider.

553
01:10:11,846 --> 01:10:13,380
Remember the guy who found her?

554
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:15,083
He was a plumber.

555
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:17,018
Did a job for the last victim.

556
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:19,954
They found a bunch of her
clothes in his apartment.

557
01:10:19,987 --> 01:10:21,756
He'd already been
in prison for rape.

558
01:11:04,532 --> 01:11:06,768
Simion. My wife, Julia.

559
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:10,037
She is as beautiful as you
described her, Francis.

560
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:11,906
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

561
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:14,407
We were just talking
about the big news.

562
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:16,476
Did Francis get a promotion?

563
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:18,613
No, no, they caught The Spider.

564
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:20,948
So Francis and Julia live
near one of the victims.

565
01:11:20,982 --> 01:11:22,449
So they saw the crime scene.

566
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:24,185
We just walked past it, really.

567
01:11:24,218 --> 01:11:25,418
- Oh.
- That's all

568
01:11:35,129 --> 01:11:36,774
Francis said that you
are having some trouble

569
01:11:36,798 --> 01:11:37,878
with one of your neighbors.

570
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:41,501
Maybe it was him.

571
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:44,038
Can you imagine?

572
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:18,405
What did you just say?

573
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,876
It's just a stupid work joke.

574
01:12:23,476 --> 01:12:25,546
- What did he say?
- Jules. Come on.

575
01:12:25,947 --> 01:12:28,216
No, no, really, it was
just some office gossip.

576
01:12:28,783 --> 01:12:31,418
How about more champagne?
I need a refill.

577
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:34,322
At least I have The Spider to...

578
01:12:35,957 --> 01:12:37,558
- To what?
- Julia.

579
01:12:38,526 --> 01:12:40,094
At least I have The Spider to...

580
01:12:41,896 --> 01:12:43,363
to keep me company?

581
01:12:44,232 --> 01:12:45,398
Is that what you...

582
01:12:53,574 --> 01:12:54,876
At least I have that.

583
01:13:02,415 --> 01:13:03,718
Julia, where are you going?

584
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:06,354
- Will you please stop?
- What?

585
01:13:07,822 --> 01:13:09,123
I can't take a joke?

586
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:10,876
Is that what you're
gonna tell me right now?

587
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:16,731
I don't know what to
do anymore, Julia.

588
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:22,069
I'm tired.

589
01:13:24,372 --> 01:13:25,806
I'm tired of feeling like this

590
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,309
because you can't let go
of some fuckin' fantasy.

591
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:47,801
It's probably an animal.

592
01:17:48,637 --> 01:17:49,737
What?

593
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,906
The cause of the delay.

594
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:54,275
It could be signal
problem or repairs

595
01:17:54,308 --> 01:17:57,546
or sometimes it's because
an animal is on the tracks.

596
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,782
There could be a
couple subway workers

597
01:18:01,815 --> 01:18:03,552
chasing a dog as we speak.

598
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:09,023
So...

599
01:18:09,056 --> 01:18:10,525
how long does it take?

600
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:12,359
To catch a dog?

601
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:13,861
Not long.

602
01:18:14,495 --> 01:18:15,564
If you're fast.

603
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:21,402
Usually, it just
takes a few minutes.

604
01:18:22,903 --> 01:18:24,506
Even if it seems longer.

605
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,374
Thanks.

606
01:18:27,841 --> 01:18:29,009
You're welcome.

607
01:18:33,414 --> 01:18:35,282
Why are you following me?

608
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:38,587
I don't control the trains.

609
01:18:42,691 --> 01:18:43,791
Let me explain.

610
01:18:44,559 --> 01:18:47,461
I spend all day looking
after my father,

611
01:18:47,494 --> 01:18:48,796
he's very sick.

612
01:18:50,097 --> 01:18:52,466
And so sometimes I...

613
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:55,069
go to the window and...

614
01:18:57,706 --> 01:18:59,440
just look at people...

615
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:01,909
going about their day.

616
01:19:03,511 --> 01:19:05,946
I know it is a sad hobby.

617
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:12,621
But no one has really
noticed before.

618
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:18,158
"You've really become sad
old man now," I thought.

619
01:19:19,628 --> 01:19:21,829
Dreaming up a...

620
01:19:21,862 --> 01:19:24,331
pretty girl who's...

621
01:19:24,365 --> 01:19:27,434
finally looking back at you.

622
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:32,172
But then you waved.

623
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:36,910
And I thought...

624
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,846
that you were saying...

625
01:19:38,879 --> 01:19:39,913
hello.

626
01:19:43,484 --> 01:19:45,953
That's why I was
so... So surprised

627
01:19:45,986 --> 01:19:48,889
when your husband
came to my door

628
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:50,692
with the police officer.

629
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:53,260
I did not understand

630
01:19:53,294 --> 01:19:55,095
what I had done that was so bad.

631
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:58,600
And why you kept following me.

632
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:03,137
I wondered if you were
trying to embarrass me.

633
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:08,275
Or if you were
trying to scare me...

634
01:20:08,309 --> 01:20:10,645
when you came to my
door with that man...

635
01:20:11,746 --> 01:20:15,316
and cursed at my father.

636
01:20:16,584 --> 01:20:19,554
I had hoped that after
I involved the police

637
01:20:19,587 --> 01:20:21,388
that would be the end of it.

638
01:20:21,656 --> 01:20:23,290
But I felt...

639
01:20:23,324 --> 01:20:25,359
I felt that what
I really needed...

640
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,497
was an apology.

641
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:36,571
I'm sorry.

642
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:39,152
Irina?

643
01:24:53,226 --> 01:24:55,495
Be careful about
breathing too hard.

644
01:24:55,964 --> 01:24:58,098
I left enough holes
for you to get air,

645
01:24:58,131 --> 01:25:00,768
but you will pass out if
you start hyperventilating.

646
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:02,837
Or scream.

647
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:04,739
Help! Help!

648
01:25:04,772 --> 01:25:06,574
Shh. Shh.

649
01:25:06,608 --> 01:25:07,976
Irina screamed.

650
01:25:09,944 --> 01:25:12,013
We had to hide in that closet...

651
01:25:13,213 --> 01:25:15,182
while you were all
looking around.

652
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:19,921
For a moment, I was
sure that you'd see me.

653
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:25,125
Imagine...

654
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:27,160
how awkward that
would have been.

655
01:25:40,173 --> 01:25:41,274
Hello.

656
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:54,522
- Julia?
- He...

657
01:26:25,053 --> 01:26:26,186
