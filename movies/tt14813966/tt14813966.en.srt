[man] Mabel. You ain't gonna believe this.

7
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:45,879
Yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,466
You won't believe this. Look here.
Look at what Brown's doing.

9
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:50,466
What he doin'?

10
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,679
He gettin' ready to burn down
the whole damn neighborhood.

11
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,807
Go out there and tell him
that's too much damn lighter fluid.

12
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,100
What's wrong with Brown?

13
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,435
I ain't finna go out there.

14
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,238
He's getting ready
to start a chemical fire.

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,870
You think I wanna be in a chemical fire?

16
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,691
That happened to me
in 1972 when I was on that oil rig.

17
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,068
Burned up all my gonads.

18
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,988
Joe, if he burn down the damn house,
where you gonna live?

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,910
Under that big-ass dress
with the rest of them critters. [chuckles]

20
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,621
You know, I don't know
why the hell I let you live in my house.

21
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,415
'Cause you can't afford
to stay here by your damn self.

22
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,125
You wanna bet? You know what I'mma do?

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,970
I'mma take you upstairs and put you
in one of them trunks in the attic

24
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,172
and let your ass
dry rot and get your check

25
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,883
till them white folk
figure out what the hell happened to you.

26
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,469
You right. I'mma go on out there.

27
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,931
Joe, you better get on outta here,
do what I tell you to do up in my house.

28
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,682
Hell, I gotta be up in here cooking

29
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,143
like I'm damn Aunt Jemima
or somebody for this boy

30
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,353
- Brown?
- Huh?

31
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,481
- The hell you doin'?
- I'm makin' a fire.

32
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:50,235
See, I'm gonna make this big for
my great-grandson's graduation barbecue.

33
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,738
If you gonna make smoked ribs,
you got to make a big fire.

34
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,342
You 'bout to kill your damn...
You 'bout to kill your damn self.

35
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,909
No, Joe. If you make it like...

36
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,121
This how you make holy meat.
You ever made holy meat?

37
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,804
If you gonna do that, you got to have
a fire like a fiery furnace.

38
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,918
- That's what you gotta do.
- Brown, you gettin' ready to k...

39
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,401
Lucky you didn't mess up my damn...

40
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,463
Are you puttin' gasoline?
You lost your damn mind.

41
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,381
This how you make it.

42
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,675
If you ain't gonna come and help,
just go in the house.

43
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,593
Okay. Great, great. I'mma help you.

44
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,762
- You got a match?
- Yes. Here's a match.

45
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,222
- Thank you.
- Do me a favor.

46
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,473
- What?
- Praise the Lord.

47
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,618
- Praise the Lord.
- Don't light it until I get inside.

48
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,893
- Okay, okay.
- Here you go.

49
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,436
- Give me that, Joe.
- Okay.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,772
This how you make meat.
You gotta have your smoke wet.

51
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,858
Taste it on your finger like that, Joe.

52
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,527
- [Joe] Mabel!
- It just need a little more.

53
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,988
I just wanna ask you something.

54
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,615
I know you want barbecue ribs,
barbecue pork and beans,

55
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,119
barbecue all that stuff
for this boy's graduation party,

56
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,247
but do you have any room
for a roasted nigga?

57
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,125
- What?
- He about to...

58
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,751
- [explosion]
- [Brown screams]

59
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,003
The hell?

60
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,671
[screaming]

61
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,423
What I tell ya? He on fire.

62
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,135
He on... [chuckles] He on fire.
[chuckles] He on fire.

63
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,555
- [screaming]
- Hey, hey, boy, hey.

64
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,308
This motherfucker is actually on fire.

65
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,434
[screaming]

66
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,852
He on fire.

67
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,104
[Joe] The hell wrong with you?

68
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,857
- [Brown] I'm burning!
- Hold on. Hold on. I'm comin'.

69
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,192
[faucet runs]

70
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,528
Okay, I'mma put him out.

71
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,822
[Brown screaming]

72
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,990
The hell?

73
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,035
I told your dumb ass not to get over
that flame with that lighter fluid.

74
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:26,748
- Brown? Brown? Oh hell. Brown?
- [Brown shouting] Help me! [screaming]

75
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,666
- Oh hell!
- [Brown screaming]

76
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,336
- [Brown] Help, I'm burning!
- Gonna burn up my tree.

77
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,046
[Joe] You worried about a tree?

78
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,256
- One of y'all put me out! Joe!
- [grunts]

79
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,591
- Catch his ass.
- Get him.

80
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,176
I got a light though.

81
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,762
- Yo, trip him, trip him.
- I got it.

82
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,474
[screaming] Joe! [grunts]

83
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:45,974
Help!

84
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,895
[spitting]

85
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,730
You gonna buy me another damn tree.

86
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,650
[Brown] Mabel, nobody gonna buy no tree.
I'm burnin' over here.

87
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,110
I hope you don't keloid, Brown.
It's all right.

88
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,112
I just planted this tree.

89
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,866
- Shit! I gotta pay the water bill.
- [Brown] Help.

90
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,493
Hush your mouth, hell.

91
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,661
[Brown] Help.

92
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,453
Help!

93
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,913
Get him up.

94
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,355
[man] Can you believe we're graduating?

95
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,841
[scoffs] Yes, I can, man.
That was a lot of hard work.

96
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,093
Well, you aced it.

97
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,177
And so did you.

98
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,055
I did okay,
but you were the valedictorian.

99
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,974
[chuckles] Hey, that's right.

100
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,269
- [clicks tongue] Ah!
- [both laughing]

101
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,605
Let's get to your great-grandma's house.
All right, let's go.

102
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,983
Hey, look, what is the rush, man?
Look, we...

103
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,112
Dinner's not till seven.
We will get there. It will be great.

104
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,907
I don't know what the rush is,
but I know what the delay is.

105
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,410
- You don't wanna tell them.
- No, I don't.

106
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,162
I don't wanna pressure you into this,
but it's 2021.

107
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,081
We graduate in two days. They should know.

108
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,959
I know, dude, I know. It's just that like...

109
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,920
Look, my family is different, okay?

110
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,921
Look at my family.

111
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,632
My father is West Indian,
my mother is from Ireland,

112
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,302
and I grew up in the Netherlands,
until my dad passed.

113
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,387
And because my mom
had passed years earlier,

114
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,639
I moved to Ireland
to live with my great-aunt Agnes

115
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,142
until I came here to go
to a historically Black college.

116
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,662
Now who's the one with the family
with the different opinions?

117
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,563
- Yeah.
- It's Davi for the win.

118
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,246
- You win. You win on that. You're right.
- [chuckling] Thank you.

119
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,192
I do look forward to meeting them someday.

120
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,194
Well, yeah. Well, let's not rush that.

121
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,991
Mmm. So... so I can confront my family,

122
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,785
but you can't confront
your great-aunt Agnes? Is that what I got?

123
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,205
No, that's a completely different story
because I feel like your mom

124
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,350
is really open-minded,
so she will be okay with this.

125
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,208
- I know it.
- Ah.

126
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,377
Okay, yeah, but my dad will not be.

127
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,004
Well, to hell with your dad.

128
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,215
Davi, why do you hate my dad so much?

129
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,093
You really have to ask?
After all he did to you and your mom?

130
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,679
See, you know, that's why
I'm not telling you nothin' else.

131
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,014
You don't forget nothing.

132
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,975
Look... [sighs] ...he will be there tonight.

133
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:55,063
So please, whatever you do,
do not get into it with him.

134
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,940
Okay? Good?

135
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,361
- [woman] It's hot out here today.
- [Brown] I know, Cora. I was hotter.

136
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,445
[Cora] You was hotter?

137
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,248
[Joe] You ain't gonna
believe what happened.

138
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,325
Brown tried to go all rotisserie
on us and shit.

139
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,743
- Uncle Joe.
- [Joe] What? Hell.

140
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,703
Cora, I don't wanna go to hell.

141
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,538
Hell, no. I don't wanna go.

142
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,334
Cora, I was lighting that fire to make
the barbecue for my... my famous chicken,

143
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,044
and boom, it got me, girl.

144
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,338
- [Cora] What?
- [Brown] I feel bad for them chickens.

145
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,507
- I feel bad.
- Chickens? What are you talkin' about?

146
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,050
[Joe] Set hisself on fire.

147
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,803
He gonna be a jigga now.
He ain't finna eat no more chicken.

148
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,405
- [Brown] Yes...
- He put gasoline on...

149
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,240
- What?
- [Joe] He put everything on the grill...

150
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,368
Thought I was makin' it big, Joe.
I was makin' it big.

151
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,395
- Wait a minute now...
- Well, your ass got burned big, big-time.

152
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,478
Are you all right?

153
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,481
Oh, yes. Thank you so much
for asking, baby.

154
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,644
I'm good, but my knee
been bothering me a little bit.

155
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,443
I gotta go to a doctor
and get it looked at.

156
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,487
Uncle Joe, I'm talking to Mr. Brown.
Are you okay?

157
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,783
Ah, Cora, yes, I'm... Well, yes and no.
I'm not fine. It's like I went to hell.

158
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,285
- You went...
- Yes, I went to hell, and Madea was there.

159
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,913
And I said, "This definitely not
the right place for me."

160
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,416
- Ooh.
- Here.

161
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,501
Now you wanna bring him some damn water.

162
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,961
- Yeah.
- Joe, shut the hell up.

163
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,754
I done burnt up already.

164
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,172
Hey, Cora. How you doin', baby?

165
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,176
- Hey, Madea. Can you take this bag?
- Ooh, girl, I like that green dress.

166
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,737
I'm not gonna take nothing.
I like the dress though. [chuckles]

167
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,138
Aw, Madea, you can take this bag.

168
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,941
What the hell I look like to you,
a bellman?

169
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,517
Yeah, well, you look like
two or three bellmans if you ask me.

170
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,537
- She look like bells-men.
- [Cora] Would y'all...

171
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,830
She... she look like horsepower.

172
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,606
Say somethin' else, Joe.
Just shut up. Shut up while you livin'.

173
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,983
Shut up while you got your nuts.

174
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,569
Please, please shut up.
I'll put 'em in that nutcracker.

175
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,279
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, Joe.

176
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,031
Madea, now look, I went to the store
to get everything we needed.

177
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,784
You could just hold this bag.
I had to drive way across town.

178
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,668
I know you had to drive
way across town, Cora.

179
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,903
Every time I go to the store,
something done burned down

180
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,835
or boarded up
'cause people protesting all over.

181
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,749
I don't understand

182
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,673
why they didn't burn up
the whole neighborhood.

183
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,750
We don't need that store.
We need to burn everything

184
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,672
in the neighborhood down.
Burn it all down.

185
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,549
Joe, what kind of sense it make to burn up

186
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,385
your own damn neighborhood
'cause you upset about something?

187
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,513
What the hell kind of sense it make
what these police doin' to Black people?

188
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,849
- Burn it all down.
- Oh, I'mma... I'm finna punch him.

189
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,311
Well, I'm just glad they didn't burn down
the church 'cause it's in the same block.

190
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,230
You know that's right, Cora.
Thank God that church did not burn down.

191
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,690
- Hallelujer.
- Yes.

192
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,941
- Hallelujer.
- Yes!

193
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,110
Hallelujer, thank God
that church didn't burn down.

194
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,154
Madea, I'm so glad
you standin' up for the church.

195
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,071
That's beautiful.

196
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,199
- I don't care nothin' about that church.
- What?

197
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,385
It's just right next door
to my favorite liquor store.

198
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,849
So, you more concerned
about the liquor store than the church?

199
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,912
That's wrong, Madea.

200
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,956
Nothing's wrong.
Here's what you don't understand.

201
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,125
- Jesus, the Lord God Almighty...
- Uh-huh.

202
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,710
He can turn water into wine.

203
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,628
- He did.
- Yes, he did.

204
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,431
I got to go
to the liquor store to get mine.

205
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,257
Won't somebody praise Him? [laughs]

206
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,967
What? You need to stop that foolishness.

207
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,091
Come on, Madea,
we gotta get started on this dinner.

208
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,347
That's all right, Cora.
We'll go to Red Lobster tonight,

209
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,310
and we come back here tomorrow
for the barbecue.

210
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,852
Yeah, oh, I like Red Lobster, yeah.
That's where me and B go all the time.

211
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,812
Oh, B? Who is B?

212
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,773
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

213
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,958
- [chuckles]
- [flies buzzing]

214
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,045
- Give me that bag. Let's go in the house.
- Is it me, or is Mabel drawing bugs?

215
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,113
Would you stop that? I need y'all
to go get the stuff out the car.

216
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,865
Go on, get the stuff out the car.

217
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,326
- [grunts]
- [Cora] We can get started on this.

218
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,494
[Brown, Joe] All right.

219
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,888
Hurry up and get the stuff out...

220
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,206
Mr. Brown, what is goin' on
with the back of your clothes?

221
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,707
All your behind is out.

222
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,292
Cora, I thought I felt a breeze.

223
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,878
It must've been when I burnt, Cora.
Can you see anything?

224
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,213
I see everything.

225
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,967
- [Brown] Can you see anything, Cora?
- Yes. You need to cover yourself up.

226
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,636
You got all kinda hair back...
You need to shave that.

227
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,031
- Cora, can you see?
- [Cora] Look like a baboon back there.

228
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,658
- Cora, you see?
- [Cora] Lord have mercy.

229
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,850
[Cora] Yes, I see it. It looks terrible.

230
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,520
I don't know how the hell
she get chairs in that damn car.

231
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,105
- At church...
- Get the groceries.

232
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,792
- [Brown] I'll get the bags.
- Take 'em all around to the backyard.

233
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,486
Okay. Joe, you didn't...
Why you didn't tell me my butt was out?

234
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,114
I... I been trying not to look
at that ugly mother...

235
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,197
Okay.

236
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,618
Well, come to think of it,
I have done a couple mothers.

237
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,454
Hey, what you keep bending over...

238
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,872
I'm trying to get the stuff, Joe.

239
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,251
You 'bout to make me throw the damn up.
I'm about to throw the damn up.

240
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,045
Well, just get the chairs
and put all the chairs up.

241
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,214
You move the chair. I can't look at you.

242
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,692
- You ain't got...
- Hush, hush, hush.

243
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,384
- What?
- Hush, hush, hush, hush.

244
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,136
Ooh, smells Cajun back here.

245
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,554
- Hey.
- What y'all cooking? Hey!

246
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,181
- [laughing]
- Hey there, baby. How you doin'?

247
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,766
Uh, hello,

248
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,186
uh, baby, my name is Joe. I'm a Capricorn.

249
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,398
- Uh, I'm Mr. Brown, and I'm a... a...
- Asshole.

250
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,233
- Leo.
- [Joe] Oh, he's a Leo.

251
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,694
- How you doin', Mr. Brown and Mr. Joe?
- [Joe] Depend on...

252
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,487
Wait, you know my name?

253
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,989
Of course.

254
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,657
Yes, this is Sylvia.

255
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,411
Oh, that's right, baby. I'm so sorry.
I remember, Coachella or...

256
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,830
- No.
- [Joe] Oh no. No, no. Super Bowl?

257
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,833
All-Star Weekend. [chuckles]
You sexy as hell. What's your name?

258
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,127
- Okay, I'm sick to the stomach.
- [Brown] Joe.

259
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,838
I wish... I was a mirror

260
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,050
so I can see myself
inside of you. [chuckles]

261
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,719
- Is he serious?
- I wish you would stop that.

262
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,637
- Joe.
- Huh?

263
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,680
- That's your grandniece.
- What is happening?

264
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,098
[Brown] That's kin to you.

265
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,225
[Joe] My grandniece?
What the hell is a grandniece?

266
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,479
I'm from Alabama.
After daughter, it don't damn matter.

267
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,065
- When you get to cousin, you good.
- Oh Lord.

268
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,233
That's just terr... Joe, that's ridiculous.

269
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,028
- Y'all go in the house.
- I'm not here for this incest.

270
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,113
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

271
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,367
Go on. Ooh, go in there. [grunts]

272
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,578
Damn, look at you walking like...

273
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,997
Damn, Brown! Hell! Shit!

274
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,915
What?

275
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,916
Shit.

276
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,876
- [indistinct chattering]
- Hey!

277
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,378
Hey, look at her.

278
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,797
Look at this. Hey, babe, how you been?

279
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,507
- Hi!
- Good to see you.

280
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,716
Sit down, Sylvia.

281
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,468
- Oh, thank you.
- Sit down.

282
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,470
You look so good. Both of y'all look good.

283
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,433
- [Sylvia] Thank you.
- Did y'all ride together?

284
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,434
Yes. I told her I was fine,
but she insisted on picking me up.

285
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,937
You know I didn't want you
on the road in that old car alone.

286
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,896
- That's sweet.
- Thanks.

287
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,540
- That is so sweet.
- [Sylvia] I got you.

288
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,167
There's nothing like a good girlfriend...

289
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,025
That's right.

290
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,402
[Cora] ...to look out for you.

291
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,904
- That's so sweet.
- Thank you for letting me stay here.

292
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,280
[Madea] Oh, you're so welcome.

293
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,450
You can come here
anytime you want, day or night.

294
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,578
Long as you don't stay too long.
You leavin' right after graduation, right?

295
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,746
Ma...

296
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,332
- Yeah.
- Okay, good. Just right after, right?

297
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,751
- As soon as it's over, y'all going home.
- [Cora] Madea!

298
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,086
Oh, is Ellie here?

299
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,839
Oh, well, she called
and said that she was on her way,

300
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,924
but she's gettin' off work.
She just got off duty.

301
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,761
[sighs] Okay. I worry about my sister
being a cop with all that's goin' on.

302
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,139
Me too, sweetheart. I worry about her.

303
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,783
- Know what I worry about?
- [Cora] What?

304
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,684
- I worry about her comin' up in here.
- Why?

305
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,538
With all these damn warrants I got,
every time I see her, I be worried.

306
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,564
I be like, "Baby don't come up in here."

307
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,649
"I wanna hug you, but don't frisk me."

308
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,527
I know that's your daughter,
but Lord have mercy, Cora. Mm-mm.

309
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,528
[chuckles]

310
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,990
- Well, she just be looking out for you.
- No, no. I... I got too many warrants.

311
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,576
Sylvia's a lawyer.
She can help you out with that.

312
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,493
[Cora] Yeah.

313
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,829
Last time Brown tried to help me,
I went down to court,

314
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,039
they told me that I had to, uh... uh, pay a...

315
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,892
What they call... what they call...
Oh, a fine.

316
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,227
- I gotta pay a fine.
- [Laura] Oh.

317
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,646
I'm like, "You want me
to pay a fine to get a driving license

318
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,088
so I can get insurance?"

319
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,532
"After I done bought my damn car?"

320
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,802
Hell, no, I'm not finna to pay a fine, my...
No. We not do... we don't pay no fines.

321
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,721
They gotta catch me first.

322
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,765
You getting too old for that, Madea.

323
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,351
Sometimes you gotta get
some thrills in your life. Do crazy stuff.

324
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,747
I don't wanna die old and...
That's what's keeping me young.

325
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,189
- Running from the police.
- What?

326
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,690
- Yes.
- Is that the trick?

327
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,902
- Yes. That keep your heart strong.
- [Cora] Don't listen to her.

328
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,046
- You be like this all the time.
- [Cora] Don't listen.

329
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,299
- You been teaching me wrong.
- Don't you listen to that.

330
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,968
- I need some warrants and tennis shoes.
- That's right. That's right.

331
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,787
No, but I called Tim,
and he said he's on his way as well.

332
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,747
- [squeals]
- Yes, my grandbaby.

333
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,792
My baby is graduating.
Oh my God. Can you believe that?

334
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,715
Oh, he said
he wants to tell us an announcement

335
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,754
in front of the whole family
while he here so...

336
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,548
- What you think it is?
- I have no idea, but...

337
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,718
Whatever it is, you know it's good news.
We all know Tim's a great kid.

338
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,179
- His mama did a good job.
- Yes, you did.

339
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,514
In spite of that daddy.

340
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,808
Ooh, baby, don't talk about him.

341
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,393
Speaking of that,
how you doin' after that divorce?

342
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,188
- Lord have mercy.
- Yes, 'cause we know it was bad.

343
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,648
- I'm fine.
- That's good.

344
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,316
- You sure?
- I'm really good. I am.

345
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,295
No, 'cause after that divorce,
you was just looking... [voice drops] ...bad.

346
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,319
- Madea!
- What?

347
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,758
- She was just looking... [voice drops] ...bad.
- [Cora] Yeah, 'cause we know it was bad.

348
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,617
I'm good. I really am.

349
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,661
Sylvia, she represented me,

350
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,497
and without her I don't know
where or what I would be right now.

351
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,582
Well, I just wish
I could've gotten you more.

352
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,669
What'd I tell you? I told you she
wasn't gonna be able to do right by you.

353
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,670
What do you mean?

354
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,514
How she gonna do right by her
when she going through the court system?

355
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,758
If you go through the court,
they tell you what to do.

356
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,011
How the hell a judge gonna make
a decision on what you could and can't do?

357
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,389
Hell no to the judge.
I ain't going with the judge.

358
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,308
You should've come to me.
I'd have got you half of everything.

359
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,853
I'd have got you half of the sofa...
Ask somebody.

360
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,313
In 2004, I took a chainsaw to some shit.

361
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,250
- You better ask somebody.
- I know that's right.

362
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,276
There's the legal way,
then there's the Madea way.

363
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,819
That's right. That's right.

364
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,239
Right, exactly. Don't follow her tr...
Don't do that. Don't do that.

365
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:29,243
Oh, sorry. But you look like this divorce
is not affecting you at all, sweetie.

366
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,036
- I'm so happy for you.
- Unbothered.

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,706
- That's right. You look so good.
- [Madea] No.

368
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,374
- But she do look good.
- No.

369
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,543
- [Cora] What?
- You look good, but some... Mm-mm.

370
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,878
Uh-uh what?

371
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,256
Baby, after somebody had a divorce,
and they go through a bad, rough time,

372
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,193
and they start looking this good,
they usually done found somethin' else.

373
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,530
When you're trying to get over something,
they slip under a man with legs wide open.

374
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,764
- Madea!
- Cora, I can say what I wanna say.

375
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,268
All that money I spent helping that girl
pay for that boy to go through college.

376
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,351
"All that money"?

377
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,854
Yes, I spent...

378
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,937
What? How much was...

379
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,292
- I got to go... I got to add it up.
- [Cora] Please add it up.

380
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:04,737
It was $37.95, is what I sent to you
to help put that boy through school.

381
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,280
What's she gonna do with $37?

382
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,925
Ain't about where it come from.
It's what you had to do to get it.

383
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,242
- I see.
- So y'all come on.

384
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,244
Listen, we get some stuff
ready for tomorrow.

385
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,289
You sit here, baby. You look so pretty.
Y'all get them 'matoes ready.

386
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,499
- Help your mama.
- [Cora] I'm slicing them.

387
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,918
[Madea] Go on, get that ready.

388
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,187
- You're right.
- [Cora] I'm gonna slice these tomatoes.

389
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,671
[Tim] Hey.

390
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,548
- Hey.
- [squeals]

391
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,507
Mama.

392
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,093
Oh, my baby. My baby!

393
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,095
- Look at them.
- [Cora] How you doin'?

394
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,097
- [Tim] Hey.
- It's so good to see you.

395
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,349
Look at my baby.

396
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,683
- Good to see y'all.
- Come in.

397
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,727
- [chuckling]
- Hi.

398
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,355
- Hey.
- Hi, Mama. [laughing]

399
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,941
[laughing] They look good.

400
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,944
That's my baby. The graduate.

401
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,027
[Madea] Let them take a picture.
Go take a picture.

402
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,114
[all laughing]

403
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,033
Uh! Valedictorian.

404
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,284
- [Cora] Yes!
- [laughing]

405
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,955
Hi, I'm so glad that you're here, Sylvia.

406
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,165
And thank you
for all that you did for her.

407
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,502
Will you stop it?
Y'all do not have to keep thanking me.

408
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,753
I do, though.

409
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,297
Tim, boy, I am so proud of you.

410
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,592
I mean, all that money we spent
puttin' you through school.

411
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,096
- You better do something with yourself.
- I do. I will. I promise.

412
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,639
You better. [laughing]

413
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,848
I believe you now.

414
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,100
You remember my friend Davi?

415
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,935
- "Davi"? His name Davi?
- [Tim] Yes.

416
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,771
I been calling that baby Davey.
I... I'm so sorry.

417
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,272
[all laughing]

418
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,025
- Good to see you, Laura.
- It's good to see you too.

419
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,778
[Joe] I got a question.

420
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,181
- [Cora] What is it?
- Why all these Negroes in this house?

421
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,549
- Is this a homicide?
- [Cora] No...

422
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,616
Y'all need to go home.

423
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,036
Uncle Joe, watch your mouth.
Did y'all finish everything outside?

424
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,415
I did the best I could.
I couldn't look at Brown's ass no more,

425
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,666
so I sent him home.

426
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,127
Brown went home
to wash the soot off his ass.

427
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,964
- Uh, I think it was soot.
- No, Joe, I don't know if that was soot.

428
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,175
I've known Brown a long time.
They call him Brown for a reason.

429
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,927
- Oh my Lord.
- [all laughing]

430
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,095
Oh Lord.

431
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,223
Hey, Uncle Joe.

432
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,394
I know damn well
you ain't come in here in that uniform.

433
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,896
[Cora] My baby can wear
her uniform if she wants.

434
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,858
She's an officer,
and I'm so proud of you, baby.

435
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,484
Thank you, Mama.

436
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,861
You're welcome, sweetheart.

437
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,572
You the reason everybody getting
to the end of the damn street

438
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,842
and backing up and turning around.
That's 'cause of you.

439
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,950
That's what they do here.

440
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,178
They'll back up in a minute
when they see a police car.

441
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,622
Tear up damn light poles, everything
to get away. You better ask me. I know.

442
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,266
[Joe] You need to take that uniform off

443
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,061
and move that police car before you have
everybody in this neighborhood

444
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,856
trying to kill somebody 'cause you
in the neighborhood. Get outta here.

445
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,798
I am not moving, Uncle Joe.

446
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,802
If my weed man can't get here to give me
my weed, we gonna have a problem.

447
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,472
Freddy coming over?
Tell him to get me about four...

448
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,148
- [whispers] I'll tell you later.
- So you need to move that police car.

449
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,438
You know, I... I can actually arrest you.

450
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,566
And I'll protest all over your ass.
I'll protest all over your ass.

451
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,525
[Ellie] What for?

452
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,863
Violation of my civil right
on January 6th on the US Capitol.

453
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,156
That I can smoke weed

454
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,365
if the weed is right.

455
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,493
- [Cora] What?
- Tell your weed man to come see me.

456
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,577
What you gonna do?

457
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,455
- Bring him on over.
- Don't be threatening my weed man.

458
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,083
- I'll show you what...
- Threatening my weed man.

459
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,628
But, Uncle Joe, you would be
in the wrong. Weed is illegal here.

460
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,588
I got a subscription.

461
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,091
Uh, I... I think
you mean prescription, right?

462
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,259
- Right. Right.
- Who... who the hell is that?

463
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,970
- That's Tim.
- The educated one who we're celebrating.

464
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,764
Don't correct him. He's stupid.

465
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,184
I know what I said. Don't correct me
'cause you went to college.

466
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,269
I know what I'm saying.
I got a subscription.

467
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,562
Valedictorian.

468
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,732
Well, valedict your ass out of here
before you get kicked in it.

469
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,359
[Cora] What is wrong with you?

470
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,861
Now, you move that damn car right now.

471
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,323
I am not.
And tell your weed man, come see me.

472
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,161
You know what I'm gonna do?
If I count my joint, and I'm running low,

473
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,790
and I run out
'cause you here in your uniform, we... we...

474
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,292
- We gonna have a problem.
- [Ellie] You know what?

475
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,728
- I'mma go change...
- [Cora] Okay.

476
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,462
...before I have to arrest somebody.

477
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,964
I'm so sorry.

478
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,317
- So that's my Uncle Joe.
- [Laura] Yes, that's Uncle Joe.

479
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,468
Come on, watch... watch this. Uncle Joe?

480
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,552
[Joe] What?

481
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,012
[Tim] How you doin'?

482
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,683
Uh, fair to middlin'.
Nuts don't work, but they still trying.

483
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,144
They'll crank out a little
now and then to make her happy.

484
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,229
Okay... Uh, I didn't need to know that.

485
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,512
What the hell you ask me for
if you didn't want to know?

486
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,565
- Fair enough.
- Okay.

487
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,860
- This is my friend Davi.
- [Davi] Hello, sir.

488
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,445
Get your hand away.
You ain't heard of COVID-1920.

489
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,322
I tried to tell you. [chuckles]

490
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,408
- [Davi clears throat]
- [Tim sighs]

491
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,410
Why... why you... why you talk so funny?

492
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,995
I'm from Europe.

493
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,873
Oh, you're from Europe?
That why your pants so tight?

494
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,792
What? Son, I can see your camel toe.

495
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,876
[chuckles]

496
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,630
- This is what our generation's wearing.
- What your generation is wearin'. I see.

497
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,009
Your generation
is turning nuts into nutmeg. Just powder.

498
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,928
Back in the day, we had nuts.
We had balls. We had sacks.

499
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,890
Now everybody just got powder.
Y'all ain't got no balls.

500
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,642
Y'all, everybody woke.
Y'all need to go back to sleep.

501
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,478
All right. Would you leave
my roommate alone, please?

502
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,190
Oh, your... Oh, he's your roommate?

503
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,650
- Yeah. Yeah.
- We share a dorm room on campus.

504
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,612
[Joe] Your uncle Peaches
shared a dorm room on camper too.

505
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:01,408
It was about, uh, 40 years he shared
that dorm room with that dude on camper.

506
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,203
He liked them tight britches.
He had a camel toe too.

507
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,121
Joe, leave them damn children alone.

508
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,391
Y'all get up and bring
them bags upstairs for your mama.

509
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,917
Don't be talking to that fool.

510
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,002
Go on upstairs. Get the bag right there.

511
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,396
- [Tim] Okay.
- Bring it upstairs.

512
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,838
Don't... don't hurt yourself.

513
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,673
Don't break your fingernail.

514
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,009
Don't strain your camel toe.

515
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,345
The hell is wrong with them?

516
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,638
[woman] Hootie-hoo!

517
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,556
[Madea] Oh, that Bam.

518
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,099
Oh yeah. Hey, everybody.

519
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,143
- Hey! Good to see you, Bam.
- [Ellie] Hi.

520
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,646
Good to see you too.
I wanna sit down. I'm sore.

521
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,316
- Sit down right here.
- Oh, thank you for coming today, Aunt Bam.

522
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,860
Thank you for the invite.
We gonna be out here?

523
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,112
- I'm gonna sit here then.
- Yeah, rest yourself.

524
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,781
Oh yes!

525
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,408
Oh, I knew she was gonna be here.

526
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,702
- Hey, Syl. Look at you, girl.
- Hey, Miss Bam.

527
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,580
- Still pretty. Yeah, you still pretty...
- Yeah.

528
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,165
[all laughing]

529
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,251
Still nasty too. [chuckling]

530
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,711
- And you wear it so well.
- Yes. Thank you.

531
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,046
All of y'all was pretty.

532
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,549
- Even your mama was pretty.
- Yes, she was, but she was a ho.

533
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,344
- [Bam] She was.
- Just saying. It ain't my business.

534
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,555
Uh, somebody here invited a man.

535
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,639
[Cora, Laura] Ooh.

536
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,101
Ooh, that new man you're seeing?

537
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,144
No. Too new to invite him.

538
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,439
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about Laura.

539
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,151
- You seein' somebody, baby?
- No, she's talkin' about Richard.

540
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,946
What? [splutters] Madea, just calm down.

541
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,156
Uh-uh. You back with him?

542
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,241
Oh, absolutely not.

543
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,952
- But he is Tim's father.
- That's right.

544
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,246
And Tim wanted him there,
so I said, "Yes."

545
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,540
No, ma'am. Did anybody think to ask me?

546
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,125
- This is my damn house.
- Madea...

547
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,768
You gonna let that man come up in here?

548
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,422
That boy left you broke and had nothing.
And I was having to take care of you.

549
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,841
I gave you $37
to help put that boy through school.

550
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,361
You let him come in my house
when he ain't do nothing for you?

551
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,887
- Madea, you...
- He better keep his ass away from me.

552
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,392
Y'all better keep his ass away from me.
That's all I'm saying.

553
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,310
[Laura] I'm sorry.

554
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,894
Oh yes. Ooh.

555
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,688
Wait. I thought you was tired.

556
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,816
[chuckles] Shut up. [chuckles]

557
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:58,775
- Tim?
- [Tim] Huh?

558
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,859
So,

559
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,947
who is this right here, Tim?
Looking like a snack.

560
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,991
- Bam.
- Aunt Bam.

561
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,619
Ellie, leave me alone.
You know I like 'em fine and little.

562
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,164
- Hi, I'm Davi.
- You Da... Oh.

563
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,665
And... and he French.

564
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,042
- What?
- [Bam] Davi.

565
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,544
- [Tim chuckles]
- [chuckles] I'm Irish and Dutch.

566
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:22,049
[splutters] Dutch?
Well, you can be my lucky charm anytime.

567
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,676
- [Cora] Bam.
- And I'll be your double Dutch.

568
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,387
- [Joe] Who the hell left the gate open?
- [laughing]

569
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,555
Joe!

570
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:32,184
That's the corniest shit I ever heard.
I thought I had some corny lines.

571
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,269
You better watch her. She... she...

572
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,272
Oh, never mind.
Y'all ain't gotta be careful.

573
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,816
[chuckles] Never mind. Never mind.

574
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,402
- [Cora] Uncle Joe.
- All right, now. Come on.

575
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,364
Close the damn door!
Got the air conditioner, everything.

576
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,824
Boy comin' out the damn house.
Close the door!

577
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,118
Joe, shut up.
You don't pay no bill no way.

578
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,119
Y'all go ahead.

579
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,122
- We gotta get ready for dinner. All right?
- Okay.

580
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,124
Well, all right then, see y'all.

581
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,210
Bam, where you goin'?

582
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,505
I am going in here to my future.

583
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,506
[Laura] Oh, well...

584
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,715
[Cora] To your future?

585
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,258
Baby, let her go. She high as hell.

586
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,469
- I ain't got no time for y'all.
- [Cora] What?

587
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,389
I don't know what y'all sittin' here
looking at me for.

588
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,472
[Bam] Tim?

589
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,600
- Who that?
- [Bam] Oh, Tim?

590
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,268
- Oh Lord.
- [Tim] Auntie?

591
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,436
- Oh.
- Hey.

592
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,562
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey.

593
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,650
Hey, Tim. Congratulations, baby.
That's for you.

594
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,776
Thank you.

595
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,320
- Oh, ain't no money in it.
- [Tim chuckles]

596
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,198
He opened it like there was
some money in it, didn't he?

597
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,991
- I was ready.
- [Joe, Bam chuckle]

598
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:35,205
But if I could, I would've folded myself
up in there for you as your gift.

599
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,250
Bam. you couldn't fold
yourself up in a pickup truck.

600
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,586
You may wanna ask
your daddy how I folds up.

601
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,090
Oh yeah. He would know.
My daddy was a pimp. [chuckles]

602
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,966
[chuckles]

603
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,387
[Joe] What you batting your eyes
and fixing your hair for?

604
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,889
You bark...
Bam, you barking up the wrong trees.

605
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,434
Tapping you out. Be quiet.

606
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,768
Hush, haterer.

607
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,022
So, guys, you think
I could fit right here?

608
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,149
- Well...
- I think I can.

609
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,632
- I wanna see this.
- I think I can.

610
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,861
I may be able to.
I'll put that right here.

611
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,778
Okay.

612
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,222
- [Bam] Look at that.
- [Tim] Yeah.

613
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,281
[Bam] I got down there.

614
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,909
[chuckles] Squoze right on in there,
didn't I?

615
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,829
Just like an apple trying
to get through the eye of a needle.

616
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,582
[groans] Listen,
don't... don't sit like this.

617
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,958
Manspread.

618
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,919
Spread. Manspread...
Spread it out. Air it out.

619
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,046
- Air this out.
- [Tim exhales]

620
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,799
- [chuckles] Oh.
- The hell?

621
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,261
If I was just five years older...

622
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,554
What you talkin' about?

623
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,474
That's when
my double social security kick in.

624
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,557
Huh.

625
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,268
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

626
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:42,022
From when I worked
at the post office, licking stamps.

627
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,148
Oh hell.

628
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,652
Then at Party Central,
I was blowin' balloons.

629
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,029
- Mmm.
- [Bam] Sure was.

630
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,949
I was just lickin' and blowin'
and blowin' and lickin'

631
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,618
for about ten years.

632
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,329
- And I'm good at it too.
- Okay.

633
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,666
I don't know why I'm getting turned on.
I think I wanna send some mail out.

634
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,834
Okay.

635
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,172
Let me just save you
a whole bunch of time, okay?

636
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,175
They share a apartment.

637
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,968
Oh, you're roommates?

638
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,970
- Yes.
- You're just roommates.

639
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,430
- [Joe] Bam?
- Huh?

640
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:20,810
Remember Peaches and Harold
shared an apartment for 40 years?

641
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,521
- Oh.
- [Joe] Uh-huh.

642
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:27,359
Remember that time I was telling you,
you wanted to buy that Beetle Bug car?

643
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,318
Oh, yes.

644
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:32,489
And I said, "Don't get it
'cause the motor is in the back."

645
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,408
That's where all the power come from.

646
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,787
- In the back... side of it.
- [Tim groans]

647
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,704
[Joe] Right.

648
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,498
- Okay.
- [Joe] Uh-huh.

649
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,291
- Well...
- [Joe] Yeah.

650
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,045
- I'mma go on to the "back" yard.
- Yeah.

651
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,090
- Yes. Well, I'mma go on and go.
- [Tim] Thank you for the card.

652
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,424
- Okay.
- We know.

653
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,093
- Joe?
- Yeah?

654
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,176
[Bam] Good luck.

655
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,596
I... I ain't got nothing to say to them.

656
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,558
- Hell y'all looking at?
- Uh...

657
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,268
- Just...
- Yeah. [chuckles]

658
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,019
- Okay.
- Okay.

659
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,856
Great. Uh, I'll give you a lesson in life.

660
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,026
In the morning, the sun will rise,

661
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,070
and if it don't,

662
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,406
you have died.

663
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,533
[grunts]

664
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,785
There you go. All I got. Ah, shit.

665
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,665
And there's my family.

666
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,748
Yeah.

667
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,336
[woman 1 in Irish accent]
Now, Mummy, don't embarrass us.

668
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,964
- [woman 2 in Irish accent] Me?
- [woman 1] I mean it.

669
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,464
[woman 2] I won't.

670
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,010
Just knock at the door.

671
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,511
- [sighs]
- [farts]

672
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,054
Sorry, sorry.

673
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,974
[knocking on the door]

674
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,226
Whoo! [clears throat]

675
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,272
Wakanda forever! [chuckles]

676
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,523
[grunts]

677
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,775
- Who she think she is?
- [Joe] Right.

678
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,114
- [grunts] Hi.
- Hi.

679
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,533
I'm Cathy Brown. This is my mother, Agnes.

680
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,078
- Oh. [chuckles nervously] Hello.
- Hello, everybody. Hello. [chuckles]

681
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,831
Whoa. Wait a minute now.
Where you think you're going?

682
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,167
- [Joe] The hell?
- They just walked in. I don't know.

683
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,418
[Agnes] How do you do?

684
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,462
Cora, who you let in my house?
What the hell?

685
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,379
[Cora] H... how...

686
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,823
- Mabel...
- Y'all with the census?

687
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,008
- No.
- [Agnes laughs]

688
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,344
"The census?" [laughing]

689
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,970
Wow, you're a big woman.

690
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,097
- [Cora splutters] What?
- Mummy!

691
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,601
I'm just saying. She's a big woman,
and I mean big, like, wow!

692
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,104
[chuckles] Is the air
thin up there? [chuckles]

693
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,525
Oh, ha ha. Hell! Who is this?
Somebody tell me who is this?

694
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,985
[Cora] How can we help you?

695
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,612
- We're here to surprise...
- Oh.

696
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,322
- Davi!
- Cousin Cathy!

697
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,032
Oh, hi.

698
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,325
[Davi] Aunt Agnes.

699
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,994
- [Agnes chuckles]
- What are you doing here?

700
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,163
We came for your graduation.

701
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,166
Of course. We had to.
For your grandfather's sake.

702
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,794
[splutters] Great. What a surprise.

703
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,545
Surprise.

704
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,130
- [Davi] Great. [splutters]
- Oh!

705
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,966
[Madea] Oh hell, I didn't mean
to drop her, break her damn bones.

706
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,551
[Agnes] I'm fine. [chuckles]

707
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,720
- Madea?
- What? She was heavy. Shit.

708
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,591
How did you know I was here?

709
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,475
That's why I was asking so many questions.

710
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,977
Really? You didn't suspect a thing?

711
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:08,895
Oh!

712
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,022
And we came all the way from Dublin.

713
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,482
- Well, she...
- [Davi chuckles]

714
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,608
In a hairy plane.

715
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,527
- [Davi] Yes.
- [Cora] Hairy plane?

716
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,088
- What's a hairy plane?
- I don't know.

717
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,363
You must be Tim.

718
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,989
- Yes.
- Hello.

719
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,118
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- Davi's told us so much about you.

720
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,953
- Likewise.
- Yes, I have.

721
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,372
- And this is his family.
- [chuckles]

722
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,458
How do you do?

723
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,044
[chuckles]

724
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,587
[crickets chirping]

725
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,426
Why do you all look like
you have your knickers in a bunch.

726
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,220
What? I know damn well what she said, Joe.

727
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,972
Joe, I heard her. What'd she say?

728
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,224
- Wait one damn minute.
- What... what... what...

729
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,893
What... what did you just damn say?

730
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,021
- She called us a bunch of niggers.
- Did I say something wrong?

731
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,585
What'd you mean, if you don't know
if you said something wrong?

732
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:58,027
Yeah, you said something wrong
up in this bitch!

733
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,446
No, she said "knickers."

734
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,157
- I heard her say we're a bunch of n-words.
- Oh no, no, no, no.

735
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,783
That's not what she said.

736
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,286
Don't tell me I didn't hear what I heard.

737
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,247
She said, "Y'all a bunch of niggers."

738
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,958
- No, no, no. "Knickers." "Knickers."
- Yes.

739
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,209
C-K. "Knickers."

740
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,171
Don't be calling us no niggers
up in this nigga.

741
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,715
Hold on, it's "knickers." It's underwear.

742
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,968
Yes, yes. It's "knickers."
These are knickers.

743
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,553
- [all exclaiming]
- Ooh!

744
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,513
[Joe] And she just damn flashed me.

745
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,599
Actually, that almost turned me on
a little bit.

746
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,623
- [Bam] What'd it look like?
- [Joe] It looked like a knicker.

747
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,728
She don't shave.

748
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,938
Black is black. Completely black.

749
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,106
Black. Bad cop.

750
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,190
I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance
to tidy myself up.

751
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,736
It does look like a busted mattress.
But I'm sorry.

752
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,238
Well, say that.
Hell, say panties or something.

753
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,366
Baby, them ain't no panties.
Them some big-ass drawers.

754
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,870
It's just... look, it's just a language gap.
That's all.

755
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,873
That language gap almost got you capped.
You better be careful here.

756
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,101
- You better not say that again.
- Well, you know, I...

757
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,125
She won't. Right, Mummy?

758
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,879
[Madea] She better not, Cathy B...
whatever your name is.

759
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,047
I won't. I'm sorry.

760
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,216
Well, now all that's cleared up. Um...

761
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,675
Is it, Cora? Is it clear?

762
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,385
Is it really cleared up, Cora?

763
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,264
Yes, it's cleared up, Madea.
It's clear, Uncle Joe. It was a mistake.

764
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:13,978
I'm still offended by being called
a nigger up in my house full of niggas.

765
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,182
[Cora] It's okay, Uncle Joe.

766
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,691
Well, we were about to take the boys
to dinner down at Red Lobster.

767
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,318
We would love for you to come.

768
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,444
[Joe] Cora, hold on.

769
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,532
Now you want me to sit
at a table with white folk from Europeo?

770
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,910
And I gotta sit there
with a police officer from the popo?

771
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,079
You just hold on
one cotton-pickin' minute.

772
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,372
No, no!

773
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,624
- She said "cotton-pickin'."
- Excuse me.

774
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,334
[Madea] Now she say "cotton-pickin'"?

775
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:40,755
We came here to celebrate
our nephew's graduation.

776
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,050
[sniffles] Tomorrow
he's going to be a proud boy.

777
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,760
Now she called him a proud boy.

778
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,637
Now she called him a damn proud boy.

779
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,389
Oh, hell no!

780
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,872
- [Cora] Calm down. Your pressure!
- I gotta get out of here.

781
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,686
I'm gonna represent.
I'm gonna put on all my Black shit.

782
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,188
Every Black shit I've got, I'm puttin' on.

783
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,152
If it's more convenient,
we can stay at a hotel.

784
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,692
- No. Madea?
- What?

785
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,611
- They talking about...
- All right, all right. That's fine.

786
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,615
Y'all came all the way from, uh, Iran.
You may as well come down to Red Lobster.

787
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,950
Ireland.

788
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,994
She gon' be correcting me too
after what I said?

789
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,371
I know what I said. I said Iran.

790
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,833
I said the same damn thing you said.
You don't know where you're from?

791
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,477
- Okay, do you wanna ride with us?
- Sure.

792
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,878
Great. Okay. Leaving.

793
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,463
[Madea] Try to correct me
when I know I'm saying Iran right.

794
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,233
- [Laura] We'll meet you there.
- [Tim] Okay.

795
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,217
- [Bam] All right. I got shotgun.
- [Ellie] You can ride with me, Aunt Bam.

796
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,096
Why do I feel like I've just been invited
to the Last Supper?

797
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,179
I'm coming.

798
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,100
["Beautiful" by MC Lyte playing]

799
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,355
- [laughing]
- [Agnes] Oh my God.

800
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,107
[Brown] What, uh, Agnes? Agnes?

801
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,400
Yes. Agnes Brown.

802
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,945
Oh! Shut up! I'm a Brown too.

803
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,405
- Really?
- Yes.

804
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,115
No, you're more Black.

805
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,076
Mummy, he is Mr. Brown.

806
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,371
Oh, yes. [laughs]
Of course. Maybe we're related.

807
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,584
[both laughing]

808
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,004
Shut up! Look at you,
looking like you looking.

809
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,925
Well, it looks like your great-aunt Agnes
and Mr. Brown are hitting it off.

810
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,008
Looks that way.

811
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,219
Mr. Brown, it's good
to see you gettin' along.

812
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,889
Well, yeah, Cora,
I speak all kinds of languages.

813
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:17,185
I speak, uh, high brew,
low brew, Hebrew, cold brew.

814
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,978
I speak 'em all, Cora. [laughs]

815
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,356
She's speaking English, Mr. Brown.

816
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,566
Half the time
I don't know what she saying.

817
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,295
I just look at her and laugh.
She be saying stuff I don't even know.

818
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,236
Watch this, Cora.

819
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,199
[both laughing]

820
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,077
- I don't understand a word he's saying.
- I know.

821
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,037
Is... is he speaking English?

822
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,539
Yes, but you have to listen very closely.

823
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,167
I am, Cathy. My ears can't hear that fast.

824
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,670
- Cora, my sugar level is low.
- Let me check my...

825
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,004
My sugar gets low sometimes

826
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,298
when I get excited
or get anxious about something.

827
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,385
Hand me Madea's purse.
I'mma check to see if she got some sugar.

828
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,470
- She usually...
- I did not pass you that purse.

829
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,430
You did. I'mma see if she got some candy.

830
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,226
Give me something, Cora. Hurry,
I'm fading down. I'm going low-low.

831
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,561
- Here, get a few. Hurry up.
- Okay. Give me some.

832
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,064
- Before she come back from the restroom.
- Hurry up.

833
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,525
Okay, all right. Mmm. Oh yeah.

834
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,777
- Get you a chocolate.
- Right before dinner?

835
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,406
Yeah, yeah. It'll... it'll help cleanse
your Pil... your Pilates.

836
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,907
No, I don't do yoga.

837
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,659
He means cleanse your palate.

838
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:15,576
- Oh.
- [Brown] Yeah.

839
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,414
- I need a feckin' dictionary.
- No, no, your diction is just fine.

840
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,375
Just go on and take it.
Take it, right. Just eat it. Mmm.

841
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,710
- Hurry up.
- [Agnes] Thank you.

842
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,129
Yeah. Ooh, Cora, this is crunchy.

843
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,091
- Mmm. Mmm. [crunching] Mmm.
- You like that?

844
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,843
- What's that in the middle?
- Huh?

845
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,679
- In the middle. What's that?
- Deez nuts.

846
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,015
- Did you get a nut?
- Not yet.

847
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,017
[both laughing]

848
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,780
- That's enough.
- [Cathy] What did he say?

849
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,854
I don't know. Something about his nuts.

850
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,939
Apparently, they eat
chocolate before dinner.

851
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,567
- Do you want some?
- No, that'll ruin my figure.

852
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,154
Seriously, Cathy. [chuckling]
It's a bit late for that now.

853
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,197
[Brown laughs]

854
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,035
[Madea] Oh Lord.
The line to the bathroom so long.

855
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:01,289
Hey, there. Look at Agnes over there.
How y'all doing, babe?

856
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,876
Ooh, Lord. Long lines at bathroom.

857
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,421
- Everything come out all right?
- Always do, Cora. Hell.

858
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,841
Me, I've been eating here a long time.
You remember I was working at The Field.

859
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,804
I was on The Field,
all the time, I'd come here.

860
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,429
Oh, I used to play rugby. Did you play?

861
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,682
No, baby, I didn't rug nobody.
No, I was a...

862
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,517
A big Black linebacker for the Bears.

863
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,604
I'm about to play
stab a Black bastard for the Saints.

864
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,105
Say one more damn thing.

865
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,108
No, baby. I worked at a club
called The Field. It was for strippers.

866
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,027
Right. Sure was.

867
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,695
Back in the day. I didn't make it rain,

868
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,864
but I sure made it drizzle.
I could get that change.

869
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,467
They didn't throw no dollars.
They'd throw the rolled-up nickels

870
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,037
and hit me with them quarters and stuff.
It hurt, but I got that money.

871
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,455
- I paid my bills.
- [Brown] Yes.

872
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,291
Madea, now you want to come
to this place and have a nice dinner,

873
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,668
and you gonna sit at the table
and talk about strippin'.

874
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,796
- Hos got to eat too.
- [Cora] What?

875
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,549
This Red Lobster full of hos.

We're at this nice restaurant now.
Don't do that, Madea.

881
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,273
It's okay. Mummy's no spring chicken.

882
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,484
Oh no. I've been around the block before.

883
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,652

On a bike with no saddle.

885
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,029
[Brown] Get out!

886
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,365
Hoo! That ain't a spring chicken.
That's an old crow.

Well, you might wanna get real full.
You know what's about to happen?

899
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,984
You about to lose your job.

900
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,445
You about to lose your job.

00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,995
- You with him too?
- I like that, Joe.

904
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:07,206
Defund this shit. Get rid of the police.

905
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,750
The same way that we're
saying "defund the police,"

906
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,794
there are criminals saying the same thing.

907
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,339
That's why crime has gotten
so much worse. Think about it.

908
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,152
I don't know the answers, but somebody
needs to have some conversation

909
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,696
'cause you'll never figure nothing out

910
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,180
as long as everybody
screamin' and yellin' at each other.

911
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,390
My tax dollar, my tax dollar...

912
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:28,102
Joe, let me ask you something, babe.
When's the last time you paid a tax?

913
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,562
You don't pay no damn tax.

914
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,063
Can we just let this go, please?

915
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,649
Well, uh, do you want
there to be lawlessness then?

916
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,776
Hey, babe, you think that scare me?

917
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,697
Bring it. Look, I know lawlessness.
I spent my whole life in lawlessness.

918
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,967
- Look who I live with. That's my sister.
- [Brown] Yes.

919
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,869
- Braless and lawless. Yep.
- [Brown] Lawless and braless.

920
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,163
Them titties ain't never been captivated.

921
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,624
They been running free all the time.

922
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,919
You want me to feel sorry for y'all?
No, I ain't finna feel sorry for y'all.

923
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,423
Well, now you're doing the very thing
that you don't want us to do.

924
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,301
You don't want them to judge
all Black people as criminals,

925
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,845
but you wanna judge all police as killers?

926
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,431
- Madea, say something to stop this.
- I got it. I got it.

927
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,391
Set of his keys are in here. Look.

[click, car alarm honking]

929
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,687
Oh, call the police.
That my car alarm. That my car alarm.

930
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,482
- See? See? See?
- [Cora] You want the police now?

931
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,818
Oh, never mind. It went off.
Okay, what was I saying?

932
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,238
Not a damn thing.
You see? You see? You see?

933
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,799
- You mad at the police till you need 'em.
- [Cora] That's true.

934
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,510
You say, "I don't take a stand,"
till somebody break your damn house,

935
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,495
steal your shit,
they're the first thing you call.

936
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,830
- [Cora] Ooh, here come the food.
- There the food, baby.

939
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,127
- [Madea] That look good.
- [Cora] Look at her.

940
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,339
- [Brown] This is hot.
- [Laura] Oh, we got that surf and turf.

941
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,633
[indistinct chattering]

942
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,596
Hey. Hey, don't you tell her
I opened the door and let you in.

943
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,840
[Madea] That was a good meal.

944
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,100
- Yeah, that was good.
- Sorry I'm late.

945

947
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,231
- I am full.
- [Cora] I mean it.

948
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,524
[Richard] My graduation boy.

949
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,695
Yo, I'm sorry I'm late. All right?
I had to miss dinner. I got caught up.

950
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,547
- It's all good.
- I thought I would come here.

951
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,115
Hey, Dad, you remember my friend Davi?

952
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,409
What's up, Davi? Huh?

953
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,745
You ain't gonna even shake his hand?

954
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,123
- Hi, Richard.
- What's up, Laura?

955
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:16,752
Um, this is Agnes and Cathy,
Davi's family from Ireland.

956
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,689
- They came for the graduation.

957
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,589
[Richard] Okay, okay.
Nice to meet you. Yeah.

958
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,673
Bam, he up in my...
I know Joe let his ass in here.

959
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,077
- It's okay. Mabel, just calm down.
- No, I know Joe did it.

960
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,055
He ain't stealin' nothin'.
You ain't got nothin' to steal.

961
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,850
What the hell do you mean?
All the collector's items I have in here.

962
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,020
I done collected this stuff
from all over the world of Georgia.

963
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:38,607

- [Madea] He better not say nothing to me.

964
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,234
Is that Madea over there?

965
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,111

00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,529
Don't go over there, baby.

967
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,716
- Gonna say hey to her.

969
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,701
Hey, Bam, how you doin'?

970
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,287
- Talk to somebody else. Go on.

981
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,941
Oh, Kamala, I did it.
Oh, Kamala, I did it.

982
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,735
You did it, Joe.

983
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:26,072
Down my leather pants.
All down my leather pants.

984
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:31,827
[laughs] Well, Joe, it's a good thing
you got on them boots. [laughs]

985
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,705
Baby, you almost scared
the sugar out of me.

986
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,416
Y'all act like that boy
did not just walk in here and assault me.

987
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,751
He assaulted me.

988
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,378
We better get the feck out of here.

989
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,587
I think you're right.

990
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,715
He just assaulted me.
He just put his hand, it just swole up.

991
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,802
No, I was not tryin' to assault you,
Madea. I was just sayin' hi.

992
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,637
"Hi" is two letters, an H and I.

993
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,808
No, Mabel, high is

994
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,434
but I ain't high now.

995
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,603
Madea, I'm sorry, okay? I'm...

996
00:39:58,854 --> 00:39:59,854
My bad.

997

It was lovely meeting you.
We have to go back to the hotel.

998
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,945
And, Davi, if you want to live,
get your arse into that car now.

999
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,072
We'll see you at the graduation.

1000
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,824
Please, please stay.

1001
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,950
It's, uh...

1002
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,535
Aunt Agnes, I'm going to stay here.

1003
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,222
Well, I'm telling you now.
If you don't turn up to that graduation,

1004
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,622

1005
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,834
- No, no, no. Please. Uh, she's sorry.

1006
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,085
It won't happen again.

1007
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,336
Well, I...

1008
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,630
It's okay, Aunt Agnes. It's okay.

1009
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,466
- Yeah. Come on. Relax. Have a seat.
- Yeah. Have a seat.

1010
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,176
- Okay.
- Don't slide off the plastic.

1011
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,179
Get comfortable.
Look at these smiling faces.

1012
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,433
[Madea] Cora, you better come get
this bastard before I gut him like a fish.

1013
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,436
Hell, I don't want him here,
and he's still here.

1014
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,518
Get his ass outta here.

1015
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,623
- You 'bout to scare our guests again.
- [Madea] I don't give a... if I scare 'em.

1016
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,482
Get him outta here. He shouldn't be here.

1017
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,817
We got guests in the house.

1018
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,777
Richard, I told you
not to come. Get on out.

1019
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,655
You just spoke to him earlier
like he's supposed to be here.

1020
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,992
I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean
to scare you, but I don't give a damn.

1021
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,743
- [Bam] Mabel.
- [Madea] What?

1022
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,662
That's a shame.

1023
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,622
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

1024
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,086
Laura, I want to thank you and your family

1025
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,255
for the care you took with Davi.

1026
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,340
Ah, he's very special.

1027
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,386
Yes. You know I worried about him
coming over to America on his own.

1028
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,930
- I didn't know what to expect.
- Well, he is doin' great.

1029
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,517
Yes. You'll have to come
and visit in Ireland.

1030
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:22,396
What? Oh, I like that.
Yeah, I heard it's beautiful there.

1031
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,985
It is. So, you, Tim, and all the family
come and visit Davi on the farm.

1032
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,070
The farm?

1033
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,781
Yes, he's goin' home
to take over the family farm.

1034
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,784
Oh, I didn't... I didn't know that.

1035
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,621
Yes, that was the deal.
He went to school here,

1036
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,040
and then he comes home
and takes over the family farm.

1037
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,416
He's a good boy.

1038
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,626
Uh, yeah, he is.

1039
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,378
Um... So, does he know this?

1040
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,630
That he's a good boy?

1041
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:52,009
[chuckles] Uh, no,
I mean about the family farm.

1042
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,553
[chuckles] Oh, yes.
We talk about it every day.

1043
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:56,971
Cool, I see.

1044
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,561
- [gasps] Oh, lookit, that is one big cock.
- [Laura chuckles]

1045
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,481
You know, they've said that
a few times about me. [chuckles]

1046
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,108
I'm glad you notice a king
when you see one.

1047
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,403
[chuckles] Yeah. [chuckles]

1048
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,907
[exhales] It's hot.
Is it hot in here, or is it me?

1049
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,784
I feel... I'm sweating bullets.

1050
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,955
Maybe I'm going through the change again.
This'll be the third time.

1051
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,332
- Oh.
- Could be the long flight. [clears throat]

1052
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,959
- Yeah.
- Maybe I need fresh air.

1053
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,293
Yes. Yes, then let's...

1054
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,836
- We'll go to the yard.
- Yes.

1055
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,120
Why we sittin' here like this?

1056
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,024
- [Cora] Madea.
- They finna run an intervention?

1057
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,401
- Tim want to talk to us.
- That's why the chairs like this?

1058
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,511
- Yes.
- I guess he gotta tell us something.

1059
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,596
[Laura] Ooh, all right, uh... [chuckles]

1060
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,599
I don't think
your Aunt Agnes is feeling too well.

1061
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,561
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just... I just need some fresh air.

1062
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,939
- [Madea] Come on, sit down.
- Come on over here, fresh. Sit by me.

1063
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,441
Oh, uh, thank you very much, sir.

1064
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,652
[Brown laughing]

1065
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,697
- Fresh air. Maybe I get you sunglasses.
- Sit by me, girl.

1066
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,366
Tim, remember
when your great-grandmother shot that gun,

1067
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,489
and your father jumped
out of the way like a coward?

1068
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,705
- Now that was funny.
- There weren't nothin' funny about that.

1069
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,791
- Yes, it was, and I'm not your son.
- Hey, what are you doin'?

1070
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,293
- [Davi chuckles]
- [Tim] Stop it.

1071
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,670
Look at him, he's a coward. He's a loser.

1072
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,690
- Watch your mouth.
- Richard, what are you doing?

1073
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,881
Stop this, okay?

1074
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,735
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- I'm talking to you, little boy.

1075
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,154
- I'm old enough to be your father.
- What the hell goin' on?

1076
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,972
Davi, Davi, stop.

1077
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,825
- You act like you...
- This is about your son.

1078
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,393
I told you not come in here
with that mess. Now just stop.

1079
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,645
You act like you don't hear this boy
talking like that.

1080
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,398
- What are they arguing about?
- I don't know.

1081
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:33,360
He's sorry, okay?
Can we all just sit down and... and talk?

1082
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,204
I just... I need to tell you guys something.

1083
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,947
- I think that's a good idea.
- Okay.

1084
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,617
Yeah, we better do that
because y'all gotta get him outta here.

1085
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,637
Whatever you wanna tell us, you better
tell us quick to get him outta here.

1086
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,331
So whatever you have to say,
baby, say it, 'cause he got to go.

1087
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,626
- I'm runnin' out of patience.
- I came... I came here for my son.

1088
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,645
- I ain't come here for all this.
- [Bam] Hey, Tim.

1089
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,422
There's a lot of us
that don't want your Black ass here.

1090
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,923
- You understand?
- [Cora] Madea!

1091
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,593
He comin' up in here
with all that damn attitude.

1092
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:01,055
Baby, say what you gotta say
before I have to hurt your daddy.

1093
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,098
I'm not like your mama,
who gonna be all kind.

1094
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,809
- Shut up. Say what you gotta say, son.
- Okay.

1095
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,604
Are there gonna be guns again?
Because Mummy can't take anymore.

1096
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,333
- I would love to say no, but...
- [Madea] I can't make no promises.

1097
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,734
- I stay locks and loaded.
- [Bam] Probably.

1098
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,985
He's sorry.

1099
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,528
You ain't gotta apologize for me.

1100
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:20,324
You mad at her too 'cause of how she got
you in the divorce helpin' my sister?

1101
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,825
- She didn't get me.
- Please.

1102
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,661
- You better tell 'em.
- Can you stop?

1103
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,120
- Can you?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1104
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,998
You right. We talked about this.
I will try. I will try.

1105
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,957
[Madea] What the hell?

1106
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,210
- Wait, Mabel.
- I'm trackin' with you, Bam.

1107
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,213
- Right, right.
- We talked about this. What's goin' on?

1108
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,923
Are they not divorced?

1109
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,301
- Wait, now Irish is catchin' up with us.
- I need subscripts.

1110
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:43,639
I... I'm not fully caught up
'cause I don't know what, mm, is goin' on.

1111
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,350
Okay, look,
can we all just please listen to Tim?

1112
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,978
Please, this is about Tim, okay?

1113
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,647
Can you all just chill?

1114
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,731
All right, great.

1115
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,650
Tim, baby, you got the floor, okay?

1116
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,985
Maybe only ten seconds, but please go.

1117
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,783
I've done this before. [slurring speech]
My name is Agnes, and I am an alcoholic.

1118
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,786
- [Madea] That ain't what this is.
- Okay, sorry.

1119
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,620
I'm sorry.
Whatever you got to say, say it.

1120
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,915
Okay, um...

1121
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,499
Uh...

1122
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,002
Okay, uh...

1123
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,381
You got this.

1124
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:23,846
Uh, family, um, this is
really hard for me to say,

1125
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,307
and I've been struggling
with how to tell you this.

1126
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,517
So, uh...

1127
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,271
I'm...

1128
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,606
I'm just gonna say it.

1129
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,276
Uh, I'm...

1130
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,238
I'm... I'm gay.

1131
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,366
[sighs] So...

1132
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,589
That's it? That's all you wanna say?
Well, baby, we knew that.

1133
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,549
- [Bam] Right.
- We already knew that.

1134
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,010
Wait. You guys don't wanna talk
about me being gay?

1135
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,262
We been talking about that for years.
We all knew that.

1136
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,515
We all talked about it.
We were waitin' on you to say somethin'.

1137
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,560
We don't rush nobody. You come out
when you want to. That's fine.

1138
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,896
- You all right. We know that.
- Mom, really?

1139
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,773
[Madea] We knew when you was a little boy.

1140
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,857
We knew.

1141
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,777
Yeah, baby, when somebody love you,
it don't matter if you gay or not.

1142
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,653
They gonna love you anyway.
And we love you.

1143
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,947
- Your family loves you, okay?
- I'm so proud of you.

1144
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,783
[Madea] You ain't good at being down low.

1145
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,785
- Oh man.
- [chuckles]

1146
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,079
- That's embarrassing.
- No, don't be embarrassed. Proud of you.

1147
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,791
- I love you, guys.
- [Madea] I love you too.

1148
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,125
But back to my question.

1149
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,604
Why the hell was y'all two talking?
What y'all talking about?

1150
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,880
- Tim.
- Richard, don't.

1151
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,132
Told you I didn't wanna come here.
But for you, I came.

1152
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,402
- [Sylvia] Richard.
- I came for you. No, I came for you.

1153
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,426
Damn this family.

1154
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,054
- Damn the family?
- [clamoring]

1155
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,097
I... I... I told you this wouldn't work.

1156
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,893
We're supposed to be celebrating
Tim tonight, okay? Can we focus on him?

1157
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,354
Now Sylvia, she wants
to beat around the bush.

1158
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,315
- I'm gonna be straight up and tell y'all.
- What are you doing?

1159
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,025
- We gettin' married.
- What?

1160
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,485
[Brown] Shut up!

1161
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,153
He getting married to your best friend?

1162
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,617
I am so glad that you are not refunded.

1163
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,618
[Madea] Refunded?

1164
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,786
[Bam] Yes.

1165
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,540
'Cause it's so good
to have a policeman right in your family

1166
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,042
for such a time as this.

1167
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,710
- It sure is. Thank you.
- [Brown] True.

1168
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,963
Just... just take a second.

1169
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,798
Laura, you gonna say something?

1170
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,884
Hell, no! You... Are you kidding me?

1171
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,137
Look, you need to get out now.

1172
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,638
Now.

1173
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,474
Ellie, sweetie...

1174
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,934
- [Ellie] Yeah...
- Sweet baby sis.

1175
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,854
It's all right. It's fine.
I'm happy for you two.

1176
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,938
[Madea] Stop that lyin'.

1177
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,983
Walk over there, punch that girl
in her throat and knock them teeth out.

1178
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,569
Then I'mma go and grab her
and knock her ass down.

1179
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,404
I got him.
You just do what you need to do.

1180
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,072
- [Cora] Madea!
- We all got your back.

1181
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,907
[Madea] Put them stilettos
down her throat.

1182
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,785
Madea, please. All right?
Everybody just chill out.

1183
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,121
Nobody's thinkin' and carin' about this.

1184
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,832
- This weekend is about my baby.
- [Cora] That's right.

1185
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,209
- I have waited for this a long time.
- Yeah.

1186
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,462
Graduating valedictorian.
This is Black boy joy at its finest.

1187
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,800
If we could please
act like family for two seconds.

1188
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,303
- Fake it till we make it?
- That's right.

1189
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,430
That's fine, but they're not our family.

1190
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,432
[Madea] That's right,
not our family. Got to go.

1191
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,349
Got to.

1192
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,476
My son want me here.
I ain't goin' nowhere.

1193
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,561
[Madea grunts]

1194
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,563
[shotgun cocking]

1195
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,806
- [Brown shouts]
- [clamoring]

1196
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,817
- Madea! What are you doin'?
- What you say about stayin'?

1197
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,943
I guess we be goin'.

1198
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,987
I'll see you at graduation, son.
I'm proud of you.

1199
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,822
All right. Let's go. Babe, let's go.

1200
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,700
[Bam] She's so pretty. [laughs]

1201
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,660
Cora, I got to pee.

1202
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,722
- Don't do that.
- Don't want me to say it out loud?

1203
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,122
- No.
- Cora, I gotta pee.

1204
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,790
- What you...
- Cora, I got to pee.

1205
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,584
- Would you go on?
- I'mma go pee.

1206
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,169
- What the hell?
- Don't be long.

1207
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:46,590
And if you are long,
bring it back. [laughing]

1208
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,343
What a wonderful family.
I really like them.

1209
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,719
They're so funny.

1210
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,554
[laughing]

1211
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,598
- Aunt Bam.
- [Davi] You seem a bit off.

1212
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,224
I just like dark humor.

1213
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,517
[Cora] Oh, what...

1214
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,979
Wait a minute. I...
Somethin' is wrong with Mr. Brown.

1215
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,398
I think it's sugar.
I need to check his sugar.

1216
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,485
You have candy. I need to give him
some more candy. Where's your purse?

1217
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,862
- Cora, you been in my purse?
- Yes.

1218
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,531
- You gave them candy out of my purse?
- Yes.

1219
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,302
- [Madea] How many you give 'em?
- [Cora] They had four or five of 'em.

1220
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,536
Oh, hell, no.
Cora, that's weed you gave 'em.

1221
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,789
- [splutters] What? Weed!
- Yes, they high as hell.

1222
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,248
My great-aunt is high?

1223
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,542
Eh, I love you. I love you.

1224
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,794
Davi, I love you.

1225
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,712
I love him. I love him.

1226
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,715
I love you too.
I feel like I'm 16. I love you.

1227
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,717
Let me go check on Mr. Brown.

1228
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,636
[screams] Cora!

1229
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,262
Oh, hell, Brown.

1230
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,639
Oh, hell, no. Hold on.

1231
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,808
- They call me the Brown Panther!
- [Agnes] Jump!

1232
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,251
- Watch me fly!
- [Cora] Mr. Brown!

1233
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,019
Agnes, catch me, baby.

1234
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,730
I'mma fly. Can I fly? I can fly, Cora!

1235
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,274
[screams] Watch me fly!

1236
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,777
- Cora, I'mma fly.
- [laughs] Burn yourself up.

1237
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,738
- Now you jump off a roof. [laughs]
- [Brown screaming]

1238
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,701
Hey, I need to get some of what
you've been out there gettin', Brown.

1239
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,703
- Somebody, help him down.
- [screaming]

1240
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,247
- [all scream]
- [body thuds on ground]

1241
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,917
- [Brown grunts]
- Now that looked like it feckin' hurt.

1242
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,502
- I missed.
- [Brown coughs]

1243
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,005
- Sorry, Brown.
- Should've got a video.

1244
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,382
Can you believe they got high?

1245
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:15,220
I mean, come on. You never know
what you're gonna find in a Madea purse.

1246
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,681
Mm-hmm. Ain't that the truth?

1247
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:19,890
You okay, though?

1248
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,978
Yeah, um, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1249
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,188
No.

1250
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,106
What?

1251
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,024
You... [chuckles]

1252
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,651
You were so happy,
but after dinner you got sad.

1253
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,695
[sighs] No, it's okay.

1254
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,406
I mean, it... it's been a day, you know?

1255
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,283
There's a lot going on and...

1256
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:40,537
Now Davi's family is talking about
he needs to go back to Europe and...

1257
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,205
And that makes you sad?

1258
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,291
Well, I mean...

1259
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:49,546
I know how much Davi loves Tim.

1260
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,964
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1261
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,133
Yeah.

1262
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,801
I'm glad they came out.

1263
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,970
[chuckles] Did they, though?

1264
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,139
Well, where were you? [chuckling]

1265
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,766
Oh, I was there.

1266
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,476
- I was there.
- Uh-huh.

1267
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,311
But did Davi come out?

1268
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,022
- [laughs]
- Or just my baby. I'm just saying.

1269
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,608
- Yes, you... Actually, you are right.
- Mm-hmm.

1270
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,528
Maybe he didn't want his family to know

1271
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,364
that he was...
You know, he wasn't expecting them.

1272
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,116
Maybe.

1273
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,951
I just want them to be happy.

1274
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,954
So, how about, uh, Sylvia and Richard?

1275
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:27,793
Mm. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
I don't wanna think about him or her.

1276
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:32,589
[inhales] I just want to focus
on my baby's graduation. [groans]

1277
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,008
- That's it.
- [knocking on door]

1278
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,718
Come in.

1279
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,428
- Hey there.
- [chuckles] Hey.

1280
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,515
I was getting ready to go to bed,
but I wanted to come check on you.

1281
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,308
I know this been a rough day.

1282
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,477
- [Laura] Yeah. I'm good.
- You good?

1283
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,354
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1284
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,564
I don't wanna talk about it. I'm good.

1285
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,650
- You don't wanna talk about it?
- Mm-mmm.

1286
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,736
Okay, well, my house, my rules,
so we're gonna talk about it.

1287
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,196
Oh, okay.

1288
00:51:56,279 --> 00:52:00,075
That man ran off with your best friend.
I don't understand. That's horrible.

1289
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,303
Just terrible
that they would just leave you like that.

1290
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:06,498
Well, they didn't steal
or run off or any of that.

1291
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:10,335
I just... I mean... I just wish
they'd told me about it. That's it.

1292
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:13,922
[chuckles] Let me tell you two things.
I want you to remember this here.

1293
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,258
You always know.
God always send you a sign.

1294
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,469
People look for a oak tree,
and God dropped a little acorn.

1295
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,139
You got to pay attention to the acorn.
That's number one, okay?

1296
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,262
And number two, if you don't remember
nothing else I tell you, remember this.

1297
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,768
I learned this a long time ago.

1298
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,605
Never let your girlfriend
and your man hang out too often.

1299
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:35,110
So you think
this all happened before my divorce?

1300
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,781
Sometimes I think that the mall is open,
but ain't nobody shoppin'.

1301
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,783
I sti... I don't...

1302
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,119
- O... o... okay.
- [Ellie] What?

1303
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,580
Okay. Nothing.
[chuckles] You like your mama.

1304
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,956
Think about it, baby.

1305
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,759
You and this girl talk every day
while she helping with your divorce.

1306
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,961
When did they find time
to start dating, fall in love,

1307
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,297
and do all this if it wasn't before then?

1308
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,715
That's what I'm saying.

1309
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,050
- [Madea] See, I knew it.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1310
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,469
And baby, it hurts.
My girlfriend stole my man.

1311
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,221
I mean, we were so close.

1312
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,183
I mean, she just...
Ooh, she walked out with him.

1313
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,477
It was bad. Real bad.
I don't wanna talk about it.

1314
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,523
- I think she wants to talk about it.
- Uh, Madea?

1315
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,524
[Madea] Hmm?

1316
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,318
Would you like to talk about...

1317
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,987
- I said I don't want to talk about it.
- Okay.

1318
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,324
It was December 1st, 1955.

1319
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,742
[women laughing]

1320
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,410
Bye, Laverne and Shirley.

1321
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,287
[classical music playing]

1322
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,456
Archie?

1323
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,834
<i>I'll never forget it.
There I was in Montgomery, Alabama.</i>

1324
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,960
Archie, where are you?

1325
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,879
<i>And my girlfriend Rose, we was roommates.</i>

1326
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:36,796
Archie?

1327
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,048
<i>And she left me.</i>

1328
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,466
Archie, where are you?

1329
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,050
Archie?

1330
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,221
<i>He had moved out.
Took everything out of the damn house.</i>

1331
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,641
Why are all your clothes gone
from the dresser? Oh no.

1332
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,976
Whatever am I going to do? Archie?

1333
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,561
<i>I was like, what is going on?</i>

1334
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,648
Archie? Are you in the kitchen?

1335
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,651
Archie, where are you?

1336
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,736
<i>I started looking all around.
I can't find nothing.</i>

1337
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,321
<i>I'm looking for my man. He was gone.</i>

1338
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,698

Black people. That is not what happened.

And you know why she's a shero?

1413

Look at what has happened for Negroes

00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,715
- Cause and effect.
- [Madea] I did that. Right.

1423
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:52,135
So, when we get to the graduation,
I want you to have some cause and effect.

I was young and sexy. I was 20 years old.

00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,318
Okay. So if you were about 20 back then,

1429
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:12,238
if I do the math and I carry the one,
you'd be about 95 by now.

Honey, ain't nothing
to be embarrassed about. Okay?

1456
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,105
I was a foolish old woman.

Don't worry. We all been
foolish old women for somebody.

- Yes. Oh, and thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

You know, when you get old,
you get stiff and achy.

Truth be told, that's why I use it.

I was singing and dancing.

I haven't felt that alive in years.

Oh, you want some more, don't you?

00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,136
Oh, like an addict.

1471

Ok... [chuckles] Okay. I'mma give it to you,

1472
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,976
but you gotta be careful with this stuff.
Let me tell you, the key is this,

1473
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:08,080
you eat a little bit something before
then take a little now, a little later.

1474
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,857
- You got to microdose it, understand?
- Yes, thank you.

1475
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,067
Go on, take a little bit.
I'm just gonna give you one.

1476
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,569
- Thank you very much.
- Just one.

1477
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,947
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mmm.

1478
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,699
Oh, that is gorgeous.

1479
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,535
Yep. You know, I make this myself.

1480
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,787
- Do you?
- Yes, I got the recipe.

1481
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,631
I'll give it to you,
but you gotta be careful

1482
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:30,043
because if you do too much, you'll get
five to ten. [chuckles] Be careful.

1483
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,712
- Thank you very much, you know.
- You welcome.

1484

01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:16,931
'cause she gettin' that Similac
with vitamin... [voice drops] ...D. [chuckles]

1634
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:20,017
Oh, I see you, Laura. I see you.

1635
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:26,065
Yeah. Now... now I know
why you not mad about them.

1636
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:26,983
[Joe] Right.

1637
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,443
[Bam] <i>♪ Lean with it
Rock that baby with it ♪</i>

1638
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,822
- [Joe] Hey! Hey! [laughs]
- <i>♪ Lean with it, rock that baby with it ♪</i>

1639
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,156
[Tim] Mama, is that true?

1640
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:39,704
Yes, baby. It's true.

1641
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,540
Mabel, I'm so confused.

1642
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:45,084
I don't know... I don't know what to do.

1643
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,255
I thought the two boys was the lovers.

1644
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:52,216
Aunt Agnes, I'm s... sorry. I will explain.

1645
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,385
- [Agnes] No. No, you won't explain.
- Aunt Agnes...

1646
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,095
So you and my mother?

1647
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:58,472
We were gonna tell you.

1648
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,559
[scoffs] He was gonna tell me. [scoffs]

1649
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:06,063
This is wrong. He's... he's my age.
He's three years older than me.

1650
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,774
[Bam] Wait a minute. [chuckles]

1651
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,359
You mad, ain't you, baby?

1652
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,445
"We the same age."

1653
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:15,239
"He just three years older than me."

1654
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,658
[chuckles] You trying
to trick me, ain't you?

1655
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:21,245
That means y'all
not the same age. [chuckles]

1656
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,997
No, that ain't what he's...

1657
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,375
He trying to trick me.
I'm... I'm high, but I ain't that high.

1658
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,711
Are you telling me
you seeing this li'l baby?

1659
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:29,879
You talkin' to me?

1660
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,006
Richard, you judging me?

1661
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,089
Hell, yeah.

1662
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,119
I mean, you're seeing this child.

1663
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,136
- What? You couldn't find a real man?
- Richard.

1664
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,847
Apparently, she couldn't get one
when she ran up on your ass.

1665
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,432
Damn, this is funny.

1666
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:43,934
[Laura] You standing there
with my best friend,

1667
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,686
but you think this is funny.

1668
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,730
You wanna know what I find funny?

1669
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,484
Is how Sylvia helped me with my divorce,

1670
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,029
but you the one
who got away with everything.

1671
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:56,947
- There it is.
- [Bam] Tell him, Laura.

1672
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,408
- Tell it, Laura.
- I got your back, baby. Tell it.

1673
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:01,827
You wanna know what else I find funny?

1674
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,888
How I'm gonna go down to her law firm
and tell them what she did.

1675
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,750
And that this is ineffective council.

1676
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,753
And then I'mma haul
your ass down to the court

1677
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,380
and get everything I got coming to me.

1678
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:16,133
Then we gonna see
who get the last "ha ha."

1679
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,302
Yeah, I'm seein' him.

1680
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,596
And let me tell you, this 26-year-old

1681
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,432
is more of a man than you've ever been.

1682
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,393
And probably more of a man
than you ever can be.

1683
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,229
This man sees me.

1684
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,814
This man hear me.

1685
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,192
And this man reminded me
that I'm alive and I can stand on my own

1686
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,902
before you tried to gut me.

1687
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:39,198
So maybe you can take some lessons
from this little 26-year-old

1688
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,158
with your little triflin' ass.

1689
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,702
- She went off on him, didn't she?
- [Bam] Yeah.

1690
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,426
- She went off.
- [Brown] That's terrible.

1691
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,040
I guess she told you, stuck-ass.

1692
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,291
That boy...

1693
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,711
- That boy is...
- Is gonna be her husband.

1694
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:53,838
[Brown] Oh.

1695
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,297
Oh. What?

1696
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,049
- Oh.
- Wait a minute now.

1697
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:57,967
What happened?

1698
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,510
- Baby.
- Ooh.

1699
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,889
[Bam] Oh crap!

1700
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,393
This is no time for Black Lives Matter.

1701
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,478
Don't do that romantic shit.

1702
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:12,898
Player, don't do the romantic...
He on one knee.

1703
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,275
Davi, please.

1704
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,153
Say you'll marry me.

1705
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:26,619
Say yes.

1706
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,080
Say yes.

1707
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,376
And go!

1708
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:34,628
What the feck is going on?

1709
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,966
- I think it's beautiful.
- She's old enough to be his mother.

1710
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,886
Nobody ever won a race
in a second-hand car.

1711
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,512
But he loves her.

1712
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,891
What would you know about love?
You couldn't get yourself a feckin' man.

1713
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:47,975
Arse.

1714
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,565
- [Davi] Say yes.
- I gotta go.

1715
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,525
No. [chuckles]

1716
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,445
That's embarrassing as hell.

1717
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,529
[Brown chuckles]

1718
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,534
Baby, I think that's a no.

1719
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,038
[sighs] I see.

1720
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,874
I'm sorry.

1721
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,752
- [Bam] She said, "I'm sorry."
- [Brown] She said, "I'm..."

1722
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,670
You could've said something.

1723
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,547
[Bam] She said, "I'm sorry."

1724
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,506
[Brown] Yes.

1725
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,343
- That's like the <i>Runaway Bride.</i>
- What the hell was that? Poor baby.

1726
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,220
[Bam] Mabel, leave him alone.

1727
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,143
[Joe] She didn't have to do you
like that, man.

1728
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,140
I'm sorry. You down there
on one knee. I'm sorry.

1729
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,517
- That's embarrassing.
- She could've said something.

1730
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,771
- Somethin' to him. Damn, I'm sorry.
- She didn't want to.

1731
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:36,106
- I'm sorry.
- That's none of your business. Eat.

1732
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,859
What the hell y'all watching them for?
Eat something. Hell.

1733
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,653
All up in my family business.

1734
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,365
Well, can you pass me a beer?

1735
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,495
- [Ellie] Laura?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1736
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,538
- Baby...
- Look, I love him.

1737
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,082
Why didn't you say anything?

1738
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:56,835
[sighs] There's just too much going on.

1739
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,297
What? You gotta figure out
what you wanna do.

1740
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,550
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

1741
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,512
Well, then the only person
who can fix this is you.

1742
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:09,472
So fix it.

1743
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:11,891
Come on, baby.

1744
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:26,407
I didn't ask y'all
to bring y'all children here.

1745
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,492
This is a party for adults, half adults.

1746
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:30,286
- Not all adults.
- [flies buzzing]

1747
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,620
Flies.

1748
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,914
I should have changed me drawers.

1749
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:34,915
[chuckles]

1750
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,960
Ooh, Agnes. You funny child. [chuckles]

1751
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,378
I need more "chocolate."

1752
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,981
- Do you?
- This stuff isn't kickin' in.

1753
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,365
I'm thinkin' about giving you one,

1754
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,967
but I want you to understand this,
and hear me good.

1755
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,052
This chocolate,
you gotta be careful with it.

1756
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,306
I remember one time I had too much,
and it snuck up on me all at once.

1757
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:54,059
Next thing I know, I found myself
in Mexico chained to a mule named Arriba.

1758
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,602
- Oh!
- Yes, honey.

1759
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,188
I was selling tequila
from between my breasts there.

1760
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,399
Didn't know what happened.
So I'mma give you one,

1761
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,610
but you gotta be responsible
for what happens to yourself.

1762
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,529
- Just the one.
- Okay.

1763
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,657
I don't know if I should.
Maybe I shouldn't. [munching]

1764
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,868
- You know you should.
- What is he thinkin' of, Davi?

1765
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,537
He has to come back to Ireland.
His granddad needs him.

1766
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,788
What?

1767
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:17,041
That was the deal back then.

1768
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:20,085
When Davi's parents passed away.
Lord rest them.

1769
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,754
Oh, yeah. Oh, rest them.

1770
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:26,008
- I'll never forget his last words.
- Mmm. What was it?

1771
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,509
"Oh feck, it's a bus!"

1772
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,595
[both laughing]

1773
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,347
- Yeah. But...
- Well, it'll kill him.

1774
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:35,517
When they passed, the deal was
that Davi's granddad would run the farm

1775
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,519
until such time as Davi was old enough

1776
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,480
and the time was right
for him to take over.

1777
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:40,898
And the time is right now.

1778
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,191
- Oh.
- And he knows it.

1779
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,485
Oh, that's sweet. That's so sweet.

1780
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:46,862
But what if his heart
wants something else now, baby?

1781
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:47,945
Feck his heart.

1782
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,283
Sometimes I'm sorry I had six children.

1783
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,329
Listen, baby, these children
have their own lives to live, honey.

1784
01:12:55,412 --> 01:13:00,042
- You got to let them live their life.
- I know, but they owe us.

1785

You can't tell me that your Cora
doesn't owe you something.

1786
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,130
[scoffs] Hell, yeah, she owe me.

1787

All them years I had to spend
on that pole trying to take care of her.

Do you know how many splinters
I had to get removed from my inner thighs?

Splinters?

1790
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,683
They didn't have brass poles back then.
Hos got it so easy right now.

1791
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:19,186
Back in the day,
all we had was telephone poles.

1792
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:20,562
And they didn't shellac em'.

1793
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,941
You had to get on and ride that thing
and spin around and get that money.

1794
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:27,194
And I did. I paid for it.

Listen. I had to do
what I had to do, but I did it.

He has to come back and run that farm.

1799
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:38,330
Let me ask you something.
What if that ain't his dream?

1800
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,541
Feck his dream. He has to run that farm.

1801
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:44,586
How you gonna feel if that boy's
sittin' there runnin' the farm,

and he don't wanna be there.

- Cows.
- Say what?

1804
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,050
Cows. Milking cows.

1805
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,052
Not milking a bull. Milking cows.

1806
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,804
Oh. Well, whatever the hell it is.

1807
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:56,598
What will it matter if he did
what you and his granddaddy want

1808
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,268
if his happiness is over here
in America with that girl?

1809
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,145
You know how hard it is to run a farm?

1810
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,730
How hard it is
to get a bull to mate with a cow?

1811
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,899
I had to French kiss a bull once.

or stand there with 'em

She don't wanna marry me.

Aw. [scoffs] It's just low-down, man.

How can you say that, Davi? Huh?
You've been lying to me this whole time.

1841
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:40,577
- I never lied to you.
- I don't know who you are.

So, all the weekends you were gone,

You didn't tell me.

She didn't want me to, but I wanted to.

No, I'm just telling you.

01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:28,805
But his great-aunt Agnes said
he's supposed to go to Ireland

1932
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,098
and run a farm.

1933
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,684
Like, a farm. He didn't tell me that.

1934
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,438
- I didn't know you know that.
- Yeah, well, I know now.

1935
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:38,231
Agnes on that shit, just so you know.

1936
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:41,485
[scoffs] The shit I don't want her
to be on is being mad at me.

1937
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:44,905
Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Sounds like
you need to have a conversation.

1938
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:47,115
Talk to him about going
to Iran and everything.

1939
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,325
Ireland. Uh-huh.

1940
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:51,328
- That's what I said. Ire-land. Ire-land.
- Yep. You said it.

1941
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:53,538
Yeah, but, you know, talk to him about it.

1942
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,123
Maybe you can go over there with him.

1943
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:56,124
What?

1944
01:19:56,208 --> 01:20:00,170
Baby, sometime you just gotta take
a chance on love. Love is worth it.

1945
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,464
You really think I should do that?

1946
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:05,300
[Madea] What's keeping you here?
Your child is graduating.

1947
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:06,885
You sacrificed for him. Hell.

1948
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,638
And that damn raggedy car,
raggedy house of yours,

1949
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:10,889
that ain't worth keeping.

1950
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:14,059
You ain't got no man.
Your job is piss-poor.

1951
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:17,979
- Why not just go on over there with him?
- Yeah, my job is pretty bad.

1952
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,940
I don't know,
but that farm might be worse.

1953
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:21,233
[scoffs]

1954
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:24,361
Last time a Black woman was on a farm,
it didn't turn out too well, so...

1955
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,665
But just think about it.
Especially in Iran.

1956
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:29,282
- Yeah, I have my freedom papers this time.
- Mm-hmm.

1957
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,785
My question, though,
was that something you would do, Madea?

1958
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,495
I mean, should I really do that?

1959
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:35,413
What do you mean, baby? That's love.

1960
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,207
Love is worth it. Hell, yeah.

1961
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,459
I wouldn't do it at this age,
but when I was your age,

1962
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:41,711
I took some chances,
and that's why I live my life,

1963
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,048
now I ain't got no regrets.
I got out there, and I did the damn thing.

1964
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,676
Have fun. Just don't do nothin'
that's gonna ruin your life.

1965
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,886
But at least take some chances on love.

1966
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:52,305
That's love, baby.
That don't come around all the time.

1967
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:53,557
Yeah, I hear you.

1968
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,640
I'm just...

1969
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:59,688
Oh, I'm just scared. [exhales deeply]
I'm 12 years older than him, you know?

1970
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:04,276
I don't think it's age you worried about.
I think it's the heartbreak you done had.

1971
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,152
Let me tell you about heartbreak.

1972
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:08,738
It'll spit you out,
make you not wanna love nobody.

1973
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:11,116
It'll make you not wanna trust
nobody ever.

1974
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,199
That's what I tell women
when they get heart broke.

1975
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:16,079
If you get your heart broke,
please have the courage to try it again.

1976
01:21:16,162 --> 01:21:18,762
If that person break your heart,
have the courage to try it again.

1977
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:21,310
Next person break your heart,
have the courage to try it again.

1978
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:23,461
I'm gonna tell you,
you keep getting your heart broke,

1979
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,385
pretty soon you gonna run up
on a heart surgeon

1980
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:28,049
who know how to fix all them breaks
you done been through.

1981
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,468
That's why you can't just stop, baby.

1982
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,929
Love is worth fighting for.
Do you hear me?

1983
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:33,847
Yeah.

1984
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,600
So I get it. Get your heart broke,
don't wanna trust nobody else.

1985
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:39,311
Buildin' all them walls.
Let me tell you something about a wall.

1986
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:43,023
It'll keep everything out.
Stop building walls and build some fences

1987
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:46,318
so you can look over and see if that's
who you wanna see or not. Do you hear me?

1988
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:49,278
You're so wise.

1989
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:51,531
Thank you. I know.

1990
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:52,949
It's the weed.

1991
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:55,201
I'mma tell you this now,
speaking of wisdom,

1992
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:58,496
when you get married, make sure you
say "I do" to more than one person.

1993
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,875
"I do" to one person ain't gonna work.
You gotta say "I do" to several people.

1994
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,043
You understand?

1995
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,294
No, I do not.

1996
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:06,658
That's why so many people
are getting divorced these days.

1997
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,548
They just say "I do" to one person.

1998
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:11,259
Okay, I... I'mma take back
what I said about you being wise

1999
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,219
'cause I feel
like you're going off the rails.

2000
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:16,890
If you was high, you'd be with me.
But let me break it down for you.

2001
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:20,518
When you marry somebody, ten years later,
that person gonna be somebody else.

2002
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,563
Ten years after that, somebody else.
People evolve. They change.

2003
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,327
That's why so many people
renew their vows,

2004
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:28,693
'cause the person they say "I do" to
ain't the same person they with now.

2005
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,612
Do you hear what I'm telling you?

2006
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:33,531
Take a chance on love.
You gon' be all right.

2007
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,015
That boy too young to know,
but you old enough to understand.

2008
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:40,121
You old enough to know what I'm sayin'.
So, baby, y'all take your time, you hear?

2009
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:42,374
Now, if you don't mind, I was sewin'.

2010
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:45,543
I was, uh, net... net... I was net...

2011
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,338
Needle netting,
and I'd like to get back to it.

2012
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:50,256
- Would you mind just...?
- Yes.

2013
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,384
- Thank you. I love you.
- I love you too.

2014
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:55,136
You've been here a long time.
It's been over a day.

2015
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,640
- Almost time to go. [laughs]
- All right. I figured my time was up.

2016
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:00,517
- Yeah, but I love you.
- I love you.

2017
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,936
- Talk to that boy, you hear me?
- I will.

2018
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:06,272
- [Madea] Okay. Talk to him.
- All right. Enjoy your weed.

2019
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:08,191
Eh... Oh... How you know?

2020
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,318
You think I didn't smell that?

2021
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:16,282
I got a prescription
'cause it ain't legal in Georgia yet.

2022
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:19,452
Don't be telling your sister. Damn cop.

2023
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:21,954
[sighs]

2024
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:30,755
This park close at nine o'clock, son.

2025
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:34,467
Nine o'clock. They trying to gentle-fy
the whole neighborhood.

2026
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,927
Yeah. Gentrified?

2027
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,489
Yeah, that's when they try
to make everything gentle.

2028
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:40,056
Like gentrified?

2029
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,434
That's what I said, gentle.

2030
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,811
They gon' make it gentle.
It used to be rough.

2031
01:23:44,894 --> 01:23:46,896
That's why I go out and shoot in the air.

2032
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,315
I don't want nobody
to move here to make it gentle.

2033
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:51,484
- I like it rough, like it used to be.
- Got it.

2034
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:54,154
They come in here and raise
the property taxes and everything.

2035
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:55,280
Take over your damn house.

2036
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:57,449
Put basketball courts in,
change the neighborhood.

2037
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,993
Build pretty house all around.
I ain't selling shit.

2038
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:01,369
Gentrification.

2039
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,415
Whatever it is, I ain't selling.
I'mma hold on to what I paid for.

2040
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:06,875
- Got you.
- Mm-hmm.

2041
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:09,169
Uh, Madea, is my mom still up?

2042
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:10,252
Why?

2043
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,755
I gotta talk to her.

2044
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,424
No, your mama done had a rough day.
Go on home.

2045
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:17,635
- What about me?
- What about you? Don't go upsetting her.

2046
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,304
I'm not. I just wanna talk to her.

2047
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:21,890
You go home,
get ready for your graduation.

2048
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:25,101
Learn your speech, you understand?
Don't worry about this.

2049
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:28,605
Parents are not perfect.
Parents make all kind of mistakes.

2050
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:30,732
Your mom, your dad. Children think,

2051
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:33,568
"My mom should've been better.
My dad should've been better."

2052
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:35,153
They did the best they could.

2053
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:38,156
Just growing up, raising children,
nobody tell them how to do nothing.

2054
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,634
Sometime people just doin'
the best they can, you understand?

2055
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,786
- Yes, ma'am.
- You had no idea they was together?

2056
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:45,955
No, I mean, like,
he... he talks about her a lot,

2057
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:48,792
but I... I... I just never put it together.

2058
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:51,294
He talks about your mama a lot?

2059
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,920
Yeah.

2060
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:54,002
- And... and...
- I mean...

2061
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:56,966
You didn't think something's goin' on?
Let me understand.

2062
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,803
Two children in college
talkin' about your mama,

2063
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:02,347
a man, and you don't think
something's goin' on?

2064
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:04,389
[scoffs]

2065
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:06,893
And, baby, you goin' to law school?

2066
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:09,938
- [scoffs]
- Listen to me. Do me a favor.

2067
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:12,982
Don't try no cases right now.
Don't do no criminal cases.

2068
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,527
Get some slip and falls.
Something you can handle.

2069
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,154
- I'm just gonna go talk to her.
- No. I said it.

2070
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,449
You ain't gonna talk to her.
You gon' go home and rest for tomorrow.

2071
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,868
Make all of us proud
with your big ol' speech.

2072
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:28,248
I... I'm gonna go stay at a friend's house.
I... I can't even look at Davi right now.

2073
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:31,000
So come on, come on.
Go on home. Come on, come on.

2074
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:32,084
Leave that basketball.

2075
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,921
I don't want people saying
we stole it from the gentri-people.

2076
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:37,090
Gentri-people trying to steal everything.

2077
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,592
- Open the gate for a lady.
- [Tim] Yes, ma'am.

2078
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:41,436
- [Madea] Pull it this way.
- [Tim] This way?

2079
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:44,097
[Madea] I can't get out of there.
Pull it this way.

2080
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,849
This ain't going through there.

2081
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:46,932
Go on home now.

2082
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:47,975
[Tim] Okay.

2083
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:52,647
[crowd cheering]

2084
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:53,982
[announcer] Derick Reed.

2086
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,531
[announcer] Tory Edwards.

2087
01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:03,774
The graduation's taking a long time.
You like my dress?

2088
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,743
Oh, Miss Madea, you look very nice.

2089
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:09,414
Thank you. Thank you so much. I try.
I got this from Aretha Franklin.

2090
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:10,623
- It's beautiful.
- What?

2091
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:13,126
She willed it to me.
Aretha knew fashion, baby.

2092
01:26:13,209 --> 01:26:15,295
- Wow.
- She willed it after she died.

2093
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:17,839
Yes, indeed. How's your mama doin'?

2094
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:22,343
She still has her knickers...
Her panties in a bunch.

2095
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:25,096
- Okay, panties, baby. Panties.
- She'll be fine.

2096
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,598
How you doin', Agnes?

2097
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:27,891
I'm fine.

2098
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,476
Don't look like you enjoying yourself,
twisted up in the mouth.

2099
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,522
No, no, no. [splutters] It's not true.
The sooner this is over, the better.

2100
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,065
We can all get on that plane.

2101
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:37,817
- Including Davi.
- [camera clicks]

2102
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:39,235
Mmm. Mmm.

2103
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,696
I think it got chilly
over here in the hot sun.

2104
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:45,533
- I'm sorry you didn't have a good time.
- Oh, I did. I did have a good time.

2105
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:46,659
I just... I...

2106
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,786
I wasn't expecting this.

2107
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,710
- [Cora] Wait a minute, that's my baby.
- This?

2108
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:51,831
[Madea] Incoming.

2109
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,959
Davi O'Malley!

2110
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,587
- Yes!
- [crowd cheering]

2111
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:59,756
- Proud of him.
- Well-done, Davi.

2112
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,217
[shouting indistinctly]

2113
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,176
Go, Davi!

2114
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:04,636
Okay. He know.

2115
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:09,098
- [Ellie] He isn't even looking at him.
- I know. I ruined his graduation too.

2116
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,308
No, you didn't.

2117
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,769
You ain't ruined nothing.
That boy be all right.

2118
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:16,064
He better be glad. All that money
we done spent putting him through sc...

2119
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:21,194
I spent $37.49
putting that boy through school.

2120
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:23,404
Timothy Marshall!

2121
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,783
[crowd cheering]

2122
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:29,953
[Richard] You did it! You did it!

2123
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:36,751
That's my baby! That's my baby boy!

2124
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:39,087
[cheering, whooping]

2125
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,256
Yes!

2126
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:43,007
Go, Tim! [laughs]

2127
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,571
[Madea] Y'all get the picture? Smile.

2128
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:46,803
- He ain't smile? Did he get the diploma?
- Yes.

2129
01:27:46,886 --> 01:27:49,097
Great. I'm getting ready
to go and whoop her ass.

2130
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,140
[Cora] Madea, would you just stay seated?

2131
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:53,393
Don't do that at the graduation.

2132
01:27:53,476 --> 01:27:54,936
- [Cora] Yes!
- Don't do that.

2133
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:56,914
- That's right!
- You already ruined two dinners.

2134
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:59,565
- Oh my God.
<i>- </i>You got to act up everywhere you go.

2135
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,329
- You know what you ruined?
- [Brown] What?

2136
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,861
My appetite with that ugly ass suit.
Please be quiet.

2137
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,822
Will you stop? He has to say his speech.

2138
01:28:05,905 --> 01:28:07,991
I'm tired of you
talking to me like a child.

2139
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:10,368
- I don't meant to ta...
- I'mma take you to the cane.

2140
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,578
I don't mean to talk
to you like a kid, Madea,

2141
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,330
but this is a big day for him!

2142
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:16,183
- [Bam] The way she actin'.
- [Madea] Shut up.

2143
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:19,669
[announcer] Now, we are pleased to present
the valedictorian of our graduating class,

2144
01:28:19,752 --> 01:28:21,421
Timothy Marshall.

2145
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,172
[crowd cheering]

2146
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:27,176
- Yeah! Valedictorian!
- That's my son! That's my son!

2147
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:30,179
- That's my son!
- He about to say his speech.

2148
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:32,324
- He about to say his speech.
- [Richard] That's mine.

2149
01:28:32,348 --> 01:28:35,351
"That's your son."
He done talking about that's his son.

2150
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:36,644
Well, it ain't your son.

2151
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:40,023
You ain't did a thing for him.
Talk about your son. Hush! Hush!

2152
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:41,774
[sighs]

2153
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,837
- [Madea] He ain't saying his speech?
- [Cora] He ripped it up.

2154
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:46,446
[Bam] What he gon' say now?

2155
01:28:46,529 --> 01:28:48,614
Maybe he got it memorized.
He got it memorized.

2156
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:49,698
Maybe so.

2157
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:54,078
[sighs] I was gonna get up here
and talk about life

2158
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,999
and all of the great things that await us.

2159
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,543
About jobs, about hope.

2160
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:03,963
But these last two days, you guys,

2161
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,134
I was lied to by my best friend.

2162
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:13,931
Well, I shouldn't say lied to.
Deceived by him and my mother.

2163
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,224
- [Cora] Oh.
- [Richard] Yep.

2164
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:16,142
[Madea] Ooh.

2165
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:19,187
- You see, I didn't know they were dating.
- Oh my gosh.

2166
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,731
- Put all our business...
- He putting all this in the street.

2167
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:23,232
He don't have to say all that.

2168
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:25,651
- [Madea] Are you recording it?
- Yeah. [splutters]

2169
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:28,988
I spent all of last night mad.

2170
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:32,825
Mad at them. Mad that I didn't know.

2171
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:36,621
But then I... I... I realized that I, too,

2172
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,539
am harboring a secret.

2173
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,084
At... at... at least
I thought it was a secret.

2174
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:43,628
My whole family already knew.

2175
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,046
Yeah, we knew. We knew.

2176
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,007
You see, I'm gay,

2177
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:51,344
and I was really worried
about what they would think.

2178
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:53,179
I didn't care what I thought.

2179
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:56,724
When I came out to them,
they showed me so much love,

2180
01:29:56,808 --> 01:30:00,728
and it... it just made me realize
how fortunate I am to have them.

2181
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,483
And so, as we start
this bright future of ours,

2182
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:10,613
I just want to take the time
to thank my mother, who always loved me,

2183
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:15,410
stood by me, worked, did whatever
she could to help put me through school.

2184
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:20,915
- And to my dad, thank you.
- [Madea] He ain't done nothing for you.

2185
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:22,291
- [sighs] Madea.
- What?

2186
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:23,375
Agree.

2187
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:26,712
Even though they were divorced
and he didn't have much,

2188
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,090
he still tried to be there for me.

2189
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:32,301
And to my best friend Davi,

2190
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,887
who never once judged me

2191
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,389
but was always a friend.

2192
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:40,977
Even though he was sneaking around
with my mother.

2193
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:41,894
[Madea] Damn.

2194
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,789
- [Cora] Why does he keep saying that?
- I mean...

2195
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:45,916
- [Bam] 'Cause he was.
- [Madea] He was whoring around.

2196
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,776
He talk too damn much. What goes on
in the house stay in the house.

2197
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:49,777
[Cora] Amen!

2198
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:53,197
I thought about what kind of guy he is.

2199
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,950
He's mature. He's a good man.

2200
01:30:56,033 --> 01:31:00,037
And I thought to myself, how lucky am I

2201
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,999
that the two people I love
the most in this world

2202
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:05,209
found each other because of me.

2203
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:07,795
Would I rather have known?

2204
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:09,130
- Yes.
- [chuckles]

2205
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,674
[Tim] But I'm okay with it.

2206
01:31:11,757 --> 01:31:14,427
And I wanna apologize
to them for how I acted.

2207
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:19,182
A future isn't a future without a past.

2208
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,811
And I'm just so thankful
that I have a family.

2209
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,314
For my great-grandmother, Madea.

2210
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:30,318
My grandma, Cora,
Mr. Brown, Aunt Ellie, Aunt Bam.

2211
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:32,653
And of course, Uncle Joe.

2212
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:35,656
[Madea] Baby, Joe ain't here.
He was too high to come.

2213
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,701
And I just wanna let the world know that

2214
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:43,748
I love them,
and I'm so thankful to be born to them.

2215
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,500
And as we start this future,

2216
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:50,004
I start mine standing on the shoulders
of regular, hardworking people

2217
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:51,589
who didn't have much.

2218
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:53,257
They are giants to me.

2219
01:31:54,133 --> 01:31:56,260
And I love them with my whole heart.

2220
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,012
Thank you.

2221
01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:01,349
- [crowd cheering]
- ["Pomp and Circumstance" playing]

2222
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:05,895
Beautiful.

2223
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:08,940
- Tim, Tim, Tim!
- [mouthing] Thank you, Jesus.

2224
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:11,609
[mouthing] Yes.

2225

01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:19,909
Hallelujah!

2227
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:26,290
- That was all right. That was beautiful.
- That was beautiful.

2228
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,000
- Yes, it was.
- [Madea] Yeah.

2229
01:32:31,462 --> 01:32:33,673
- [Davi] Hey.
- Hey. Come with me.

2230
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:38,511
I thought I was the one
with the big secret.

2231
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:41,847
Oh. [scoffs]
We didn't wanna hurt you, baby.

2232
01:32:42,848 --> 01:32:43,849
Do you love him?

2233
01:32:45,142 --> 01:32:46,769
Yes, I do.

2234
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,314
Do you love her?

2235
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:51,857
Yes, I do.

2236
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:55,403
You should've told me.

2237
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:56,571
I... I know. I'm sorry.

2238
01:32:57,738 --> 01:33:00,116
We're sorry. I'm sorry.

2239
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:03,035
Look, trust me. We were gonna tell you.

2240
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:06,789
Don't... don't be sorry. I...

2241
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:09,208
I know what it's like to have a secret,

2242
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:12,878
and I feel so good now
that my family knows.

2243
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:16,424
And I... I don't want you to hide it.

2244
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:20,094
I'm so proud of you, baby.
I stay proud of you. Come here.

2245
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:21,887
- I love you.
- [Laura] I love you.

2246
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:23,514
[Tim, Laura exhale]

2247
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,808
- I'm not calling you Dad.
- I wouldn't want you to.

2248
01:33:25,891 --> 01:33:27,268
And... and if you hurt her...

2249
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:29,687
- Hey.
- I wouldn't do that.

2250
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,440
But it doesn't matter now.
She won't marry me.

2251
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:33,983
What?

2252
01:33:34,066 --> 01:33:36,861
Mom, you... you just said you loved him.
What's the problem?

2253
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:39,822
[scoffs] He has to go back to Ireland.

2254
01:33:39,905 --> 01:33:42,074
His great-aunt made that very clear to me.

2255
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:43,075
What?

2256
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,619
Is that why you said no?

2257
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:47,496
Well, I don't want us
to be a rift in your family.

2258
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,791
- Don't you...
- Oh, Davi, son, congratulations.

2259
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:54,462
You did the family
and the whole country of Ireland proud.

2260
01:33:54,545 --> 01:33:57,590
Thank you.
Aunt Agnes, I need to speak with you.

2261
01:33:57,673 --> 01:34:00,426
There's nothing left to be said, son.
I'm delighted to be here.

2262
01:34:00,509 --> 01:34:01,802
And I'm delighted you were here.

2263
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:02,720
Well, there we go.

2264
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:05,222
Mummy, will you let Davi speak, please.

2265
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:08,768
- Thanks, Cathy. I...
- Go on, say what you want to say.

2266
01:34:08,851 --> 01:34:10,895
- I knew I was...
- Wait, hold on a second.

2267
01:34:10,978 --> 01:34:12,521
I forgot your card.

2268
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,982
- Here's your graduation present. Open it.
- What...

2269
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:21,113
What's this?

2270
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:25,242
- It's your ticket to Ireland. Canceled.
- What?

2271
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:27,869
- But...
- But nothing.

2272
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:30,706
Davi, you know how much
I want you to come home,

2273
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:33,709
and you know how much
I respect family tradition.

2274
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:35,961
But a wise woman told me,

2275
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:40,007
"Children have to live their own lives.
They have to make their own decisions."

2276
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:43,177
And she said something about
being a Black whore's...

2277
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,887
Anyway, that's irrelevant.

2278
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,055
The thing is,

2279
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,557
your life is here, son.

2280
01:34:49,725 --> 01:34:51,560
And I think your happiness is here too.

2281
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:54,522
- [chuckles]
- And that's all I want for you.

2282
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,110
[Brown] Oh, that's good. That's, like...

2283
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:00,528
That's so good.

2284
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:03,489
- [sniffles]
- [sighs]

2285
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,617
[chuckles] So you don't mind
if we get married?

2286
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,661
I don't think
that's a question for Aunt Agnes.

2287
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:11,205
I think that's a question
for the beautiful lady right here.

2288
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:12,707
What you got to say?

2289
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,125
Laura...

2290
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:17,878
Don't you get down on your knee again.

2291
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,171
She already said no.

2292
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:21,132
Yeah, you done embarrassed yourself once.

2293
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,526
- Would you two hush?
- But Cora...

2294
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,219
- You wasting time.
- He can propose and marry my daughter.

2295
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:26,982
I'm keeping him from embarrassing himself.

2296
01:35:27,012 --> 01:35:29,140
Yeah, I'mma take a picture.
Hush. Go ahead, baby.

2297
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:30,474
- Do it. Do it
- Just ask.

2298
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,560
- [Cora] I'mma see if she gon' say yes.
- Laura.

2299
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:35,896
[breathes deeply] Will you marry me?

2300
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:36,980
[Brown] Shh.

2301
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,066
Yes.

2302
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,068
- Yes!
- Yes!

2303
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:44,697
[Cora] Yes, we'll marry you.
Yes, we'll marry you.

2304
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:49,201
I want you to tie that knot.
And y'all will go to holy mattresmony.

2305
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:51,871
- What are you gonna tell his grandpa?
- Nothing.

2306
01:35:51,954 --> 01:35:53,080
Nothing?

2307
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:54,874
His granddad is in jail.

2308
01:35:54,957 --> 01:35:57,585
He was found in a hotel room
naked with a drunk sheep.

2309
01:35:57,668 --> 01:35:59,044
- Shut...
- [Cora, Brown] What?

2310
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:00,421
- A sheep?
- [Agnes] Hmm.

2311
01:36:00,504 --> 01:36:02,131
- That's nasty.
- Yeah.

2312
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,092
He brought the sheep in hisself?

2313
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:08,220
- No, no. It was a... it was a... a blind date.
- Oh.

2314
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,347
I done seen that movie and the sequel.

2315
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:12,057
- [Agnes chuckles]
- [Cora] Ooh!

2316
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:15,269
I love you, Aunt Agnes.

2317
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:18,272
- I know, son, and I love you.
- [Bam] Congratulations.

2318
01:36:18,355 --> 01:36:21,066
Now, we have a plane to catch.
Cathy, come on.

2319
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,401
That is so nice.

2320
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:25,279
God bless y'all.
I'm so proud of y'all. Whoo!

2321
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:27,198
- Laura.
- Where's Madea?

2322
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:29,200
Over there asleep.

2323
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,243
I wanna say goodbye. Cathy, come on.

2324
01:36:32,077 --> 01:36:32,912
Wait here.

2325
01:36:32,995 --> 01:36:35,206
Oh, baby, I'm so proud of you.

2326
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,082
Man, let me do y'all wedding.

2327
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:41,128
Mmm. Yeah. Jay, thank you, Jay.

2328
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:42,212
Madea.

2329
01:36:42,671 --> 01:36:46,801
Oh, you... you scared me.
I fell asleep on that indica. Mmm.

2330
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:48,260
- Is it over?
- Yes.

2331
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:50,221
Oh, okay. Okay.

2332
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:52,348
- We have to get to the plane.
- Mmm.

2333
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:53,599
I'm letting Davi stay.

2334
01:36:53,682 --> 01:36:55,562
I knew you would.
That is the right thing to do.

2335
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:56,881
I knew you'd do the right thing.

2336
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:58,604
[chuckles] Madea, thanks very much.

2337
01:36:58,687 --> 01:37:01,398
You were a wonderful hostess,
and thank you for the talks...

2338
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,067
I'm a wonderful ho-stess?

2339
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:04,652
Ho-stess.

2340
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:07,863
Oh, that's hos, plural.
Okay, yes. I get it.

2341
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:10,908
Thank you so much for the talks,
and thank you for the recipe.

2342
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,785
Oh, you welcome. Don't go to jail.

2343
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:15,287
You get five to ten
if you make too much. [chuckles]

2344
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:18,290
When you gonna come across the pond?
Come and visit us.

2345
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:20,042
- Hmm.
- It'd be nice to show you around.

2346
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:21,961
- I'll show you everywhere.
- Hmm.

2347
01:37:22,044 --> 01:37:24,672
Maybe Mrs. Brown and Madea do Europe.

2348
01:37:24,755 --> 01:37:26,715
- Ooh, I love that.
- [chuckles]

2349
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:28,519
I can't wait to show you
my beloved Ireland.

2350
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:31,971
Oh, you had me till you started talking
about Iran. Baby, I can't go to Iran.

2351
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:35,558
- Ireland.
- I know, too much sand in that Iran-land.

2352
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:37,518
Fuck's sake.

2353
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:38,853
- Whatever.
- Mmm.

2354
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:41,146
- Right. Well, I better go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

2355
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:43,607
- Thanks for everything.
- You travel safe. Fly.

2356
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,067
- Bye.
- Bye.

2357
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:48,153
Listen. Thank you so much
from the bottom of my heart.

2358
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:49,071
I appreciate it.

2359
01:37:49,154 --> 01:37:51,490
- Thank you.
- I'm high as hell, or I'd walk you out.

2360
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,701
- I'm going now.
- Okay, I gotta find the steps.

2361
01:37:53,784 --> 01:37:55,953
That's why I falled asleep up here.
I'm high as hell.

2362
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:57,204
- Okay.

- Bye.
- Bye, Agnes.

- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- You did, baby.

2367
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:05,170
- Oh, did I?
- Twice. Okay. All right.

You all up in my space. [chuckles] Bye.

Mabel, did you...
What you dreaming up here about?
