3
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:12,946
Mrs. Price, you can't just show up
unannounced in the middle of a semester

4
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,614
and remove your son from the school.

5
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:17,659
I don't wanna fill these out
and I'm not going to.

6
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,829
And I'm afraid that concludes the tune.

7
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:22,456
Good morning.

8
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,008
- What do you wanna do?
- I don't know.

9
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,097
You wanna come away with me?

10
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,016
These rules are put in place
for a reason, Mrs. Price.

11
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,146
- What about my clothes?
- I'll buy you new clothes.

12
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:42,251
Did you drink to the brink
of sound reasoning?

13
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:49,509
Were you driven to insomnia
by the violence of your muse?

14
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:51,761
No.

15
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,640
Menstruating?

16
00:02:58,185 --> 00:02:59,853
How are things with Susan?

17
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:02,940
We're in our holding pattern,
as if you didn't know.

18
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,320
Oh, to be young-ish and in love-ish.

19
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:11,658
Will you see her today?

20
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:21,293
I can't join you anyway.
Mr. Baker insists on a meeting.

21
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:22,920
Another plea for thrift?

22
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:27,550
Wait and see.

23
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:33,014
It's all gone.

24
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:36,059
What's all gone?

25
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:39,604
Not the money in my account.

26
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:44,235
- It's not your account for long.
- It's in my name.

27
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,239
The name you get to keep,
but every penny in that account,

28
00:03:48,322 --> 00:03:50,658
in addition to the investments
and properties,

29
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,493
are going back to the bank.

30
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:54,288
The properties...

31
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:59,168
You'll be locked out
on the first of January at the latest.

32
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,591
Certainly I'll be able to keep the money
I brought to the marriage.

33
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:11,931
That was shuffled into the estate
a long time ago.

34
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:15,852
And it wasn't, excuse me,
a very large sum.

35
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:18,856
And Malcolm's legacy?

36
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:21,650
No.

37
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:28,824
I spoke to you about this
as a possibility for seven years.

38
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:33,371
And then an eventuality for three.
What did you think was going to happen?

39
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:37,751
Frances, what...? What was your plan?

40
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,588
My plan was to die
before the money ran out,

41
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:43,466
but I kept, and keep, not dying.

42
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,219
And here I am.

43
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:00,692
All right.

44
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:04,571
It's all been settled, then.

45
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:09,702
So now I want you to tell me what to do.

46
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:13,581
- Do?
- Yes, tell me, please.

47
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:16,668
What can I say? Take a loan from a friend.

48
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:20,506
Impossible. Name something else.

49
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:23,968
There's only one thing you can do,
Frances. Sell it all.

50
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:27,429
Sell the jewelry, the art, the books.

51
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:30,976
Sell them privately, quietly. Cheaply.

52
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:35,605
Bring me the checks and I'll have it all
transferred to cash for you.

53
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:43,990
And then what?

54
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:45,116
And then...

55
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:47,869
whatever you wish.

56
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:53,709
Watch it.

57
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,306
- Susan...
- What if we went to Frances

58
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:08,057
and told her about our engagement?

59
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,310
You know, together.

60
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:14,230
- What, you and me?
- Together. Yes.

61
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,275
- When?
- Now.

62
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,446
Talk to my mother together now?

63
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:25,701
No.

64
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,579
- Why?
- It's a bad idea.

65
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:32,292
The only way it will work
is if I tell her myself.

66
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:36,421
- What exactly are you afraid of?
- The same thing you're afraid of.

67
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,178
I'm gonna tell her now.

68
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,572
Listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

69
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:04,117
Are you cooking?

70
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:05,662
No.

71
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:08,957
I just like the sound it makes.

72
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:15,463
What is it?

73
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,010
What's that, Mr. Mumbles?

74
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:24,473
Well, my news trumps yours.

75
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,518
Are you ready for this?

76
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:34,192
We're insolvent.

77
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:39,197
We've nothing left.

78
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:42,702
Nothing left!

79
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,876
<i>...precious metals
because they're long-term assets.</i>

80
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,128
<i>I mean, gold is money.</i>

81
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:34,007
<i>So if you wanna hold gold,
you hold gold as a reserve asset.</i>

82
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,883
<i>You don't buy it today and sell tomorrow.</i>

83
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,302
About my fee.

84
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:44,060
A straight 30 percent,
and that is non-negotiable.

85
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,063
- Isn't it?
- Nope.

86
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:53,820
Mightn't it be? Well, it's going to
have to be if you wanna work with me.

87
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,659
Twenty-seven percent.

88
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:01,829
I'll give you 15 percent
or I'll thank you for your time.

89
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:03,831
- Twenty-five.
- Oh, Mr. Rudy...

90
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:07,293
If you name another figure
that isn't 15 percent, I'll go to 14.

91
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:10,088
Name another,
I'll go to 13 and on down the line

92
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:11,965
until your payment...

93
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:16,010
and your sole function
in regard to my life,

94
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,721
disappears altogether.

95
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:21,475
Well, that's no way to negotiate.
It's a tricky job.

96
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,186
It could be detrimental to my reputation.

97
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,437
Your reputation?

98
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,399
- That's humorous.
- Is that right?

99
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:35,407
Have you heard any rumors
regarding my mental health?

100
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,284
No.

101
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:41,204
Well, I heard that you are odd.

102
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:44,208
- Odd?
- Odd, yes. Difficult.

103
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,835
Difficult.

104
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,297
And then there's the story
about your husband.

105
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,675
Oh, which story is that?

106
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,262
You finding him.

107
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,055
Yes?

108
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,933
You know.

109
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:05,607
I found him, but then I left the body
for a while, didn't I?

110
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:10,111
- People still talk about that?
- Sure they do. Of course.

111
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:14,073
Well, I'm going to tell you
a private truth now.

112
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:15,950
I'm more than odd.

113
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:20,456
There's a goodly part of me
that wants to set this building on fire

114
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:22,499
with myself and my son locked in.

115
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:25,628
What do you think of that?

116
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,967
That's none of my business.

117
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,594
I say it is.

118
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:34,971
Because if I don't get my price,

119
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:38,099
this goodly part of me
will become ever more goodly.

120
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:46,025
The hens are clucking, Frances.

121
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:49,737
- Are they saying I'm broke?
- They are. Are you?

122
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,802
A plan is coming to me.

123
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:14,848
Possibly idiotic. I don't know.
But the more options, the better, right?

124
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,478
What about my apartment in Paris?

125
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:23,816
I haven't been there in a year.
It's just sitting empty.

126
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,069
To get out of New York
is the thing, honey.

127
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:29,531
It's sensible.

128
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,158
Sensible.

129
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:34,536
- Sensible.
- Sensible.

130
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,627
- I'll get this.
- No.

131
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:43,671
Frances...

132
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:48,593
Thank you.

133
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:07,113
The check bounced again, Mrs. Price.

134
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:13,161
Mrs. Price?

135
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:27,801
Could I have cash?

136
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:32,557
Do you have any cash for Sylvia?

137
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,685
- How much?
- Six hundred.

138
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,069
Thanks, Malcolm.

139
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:50,868
There's been a change in plans, pal.

140
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:56,375
I didn't know there was a plan
to begin with.

141
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:01,213
Yes, well, it's been decided
that we're going to go to Paris.

142
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:03,090
We are?

143
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,010
For how long?

144
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:11,850
Difficult to say.
Perhaps for the rest of our lives.

145
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:49,473
So, what do you have to report, Malcolm?

146
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:55,439
Have you told your mother
about our engagement?

147
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,443
I want to.

148
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:03,864
The thing that I can't figure out

149
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:07,702
is whether or not you expect me
to wait for you.

150
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:08,786
Of course I do.

151
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:13,625
But that wouldn't be very chivalrous
of me to ask, would it?

152
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,630
Is chivalry an interest of yours?

153
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:21,425
I have many interests.

154
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:27,473
Would you describe yourself as a coward?

155
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:29,601
No.

156
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,979
How would you describe yourself?

157
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,150
I don't know that I'd bother to
in the first place.

158
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:43,199
I want you to know that I am trying
to fall out of love with you.

159
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,159
- Susan...
- What?

160
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:47,078
I'm going to Paris.

161
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:49,372
Paris.

162
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,002
When are you going to Paris?

163
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:56,922
Soon.

164
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,216
- How soon?
- I think tomorrow.

165
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,842
You think tomorrow?

166
00:15:05,682 --> 00:15:07,183
When are you coming back?

167
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:11,271
That's the thing. I don't really know.

168
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,275
Well.

169
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:22,533
It's all very moving, I'm sure.

170
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:25,160
What?

171
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:26,704
Your devotion to a woman

172
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:30,542
who didn't hardly introduce herself to you
until you were 12 years old.

173
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:35,422
Your refusal to live beyond the rules
that she's written for her own benefit.

174
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:42,513
You don't bring flowers to someone
you're saying goodbye to, Malcolm.

175
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:48,352
Please leave.

176
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:26,310
All good things must end.

177
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:31,650
- But are you certain you have to go?
- Yes. And we're very sorry about it.

178
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:35,237
What a shame,
we were having such a lovely evening.

179
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,782
- Were you really?
- Oh, such a lovely evening.

180
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:44,163
And I do hate to go, but it sounds like
we've got a proper emergency at home,

181
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:46,332
and what can be done in the face of that?

182
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:48,167
Nothing.

183
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:08,981
I'll miss this.

184
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:11,150
What?

185
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:13,528
This.

186
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,206
Got anything to spare tonight, folks?

187
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,380
Possibly we do.

188
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,551
But may we ask
what you need the money for?

189
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:38,513
I guess I'd like a little wine,
if you wanna know.

190
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:41,976
What's your name?

191
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,186
Dan.

192
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,567
Daniel, what would you do
if we gave you $20?

193
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:57,659
I could get a gallon of Three Roses,
a pack of cigarettes and a weenie.

194
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,787
And where would you take it all?
Back to your room?

195
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,539
I'd take it into the park.

196
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,002
That's where I sleep most nights,
in the park.

197
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:13,760
So you'd lie under a bush...

198
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:18,265
and smoke your cigarettes
and drink your wine.

199
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,685
Look up at the stars.

200
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:23,270
Why not?

201
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:40,957
That guy wasn't bothering you two, I hope?

202
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:45,169
- Looked like he was putting a bite on you.
- Who? Daniel?

203
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:48,297
No, not at all. He's a friend of ours.

204
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,679
I thank God for the fact
of a man like him.

205
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,640
Not that it's any of your business.

206
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,734
Let's.

207
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:59,917
- Why euro, Frances?
- I'm going to Paris.

208
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,837
Oh, that's right,
you talk the talk, don't you?

209
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:07,800
Little prince.

210
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,726
- I'm going to miss you, Frances.
- Won't you all.

211
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:22,316
They broke the mold with that one.

212
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:24,818
<i>"Cochon"</i> means pig.

213
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,742
I'm sorry.

214
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:50,578
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

215
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:54,666
I'm sorry!

216
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:06,137
I shouldn't have done it.

217
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,185
What?

218
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:25,032
Excuse me.

219
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:27,326
Whose cat is this?

220
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:08,746
I'm Malcolm.

221
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:14,669
- Will you tell me your name?
- Madeleine.

222
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:17,798
Madeleine. Will you have a drink with me?

223
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:19,925
No.

224
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:26,015
- Who's this person?
- Madeleine.

225
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:28,517
She tells fortunes on the ship.

226
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,146
What's she doing?

227
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:34,232
I'm sorry.

228
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,569
Do you not know?

229
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:40,781
We know.

230
00:23:42,074 --> 00:23:44,619
We're going to lie down.
You can visit us later.

231
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,627
What's she paying you?

232
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,504
- Paying me?
- Aren't you her gigolo?

233
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:57,758
Oh, God, no. That's my mother.

234
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:03,221
Excuse me, but you'd be surprised
at how common it is.

235
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:07,936
What was that woman
so upset about before?

236
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:15,693
A third of the people onboard this ship
are in the presence of death.

237
00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:19,823
But if I say a single word about it,
off I go.

238
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:21,700
You told that woman that she's dying?

239
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:25,996
She'll never see land again.

240
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:31,628
Dry gin martini.

241
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:35,548
Two.

242
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,509
Okay.

243
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,146
I won't be needing these.

244
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,691
It's like retirement in a way.

245
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:58,073
Though, no, I've never worked a day,
so, what mantle is being retired, even?

246
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,581
I'm not sure how we're going
to get you into France.

247
00:25:19,513 --> 00:25:21,473
All that lovely money.

248
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:51,130
I understand you're moving to Paris.

249
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:56,178
- Are you very excited?
- I suppose I should be.

250
00:25:57,888 --> 00:26:00,933
I admire you carving out
a second act for yourself.

251
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:03,810
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

252
00:26:04,436 --> 00:26:08,942
But it's the third, if we're to be honest.
Or the coda, if you'd rather.

253
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,697
Is it true that it's five miles
to the bottom of the ocean?

254
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,203
At its deepest, it's shy of that,
but only just.

255
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,416
Five miles is an uncommon depth, however.

256
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,836
Where we are now,
it's more along the line of two miles.

257
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,131
You can take some solace in that.

258
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:32,592
A little bit.

259
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:34,928
Are you all right?

260
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,100
I'm the ship's doctor, right?

261
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:41,018
Right.

262
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:44,438
Well, yesterday some moron
posing as a gypsy

263
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:47,358
told one of the passengers
that she was dying.

264
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:51,279
Which is bad enough.
Then the woman really did die.

265
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:54,491
- Do you mean Madeleine?
- The gypsy?

266
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,619
Yeah. I think that was her name.
You know her?

267
00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:03,542
- Well, they just threw her into the jug.
- The jug?

268
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:05,795
The brig.

269
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,424
- Can they do that?
- Goddamn right they can.

270
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:13,052
A middling lawyer could prove
that your buddy murdered that woman.

271
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:17,600
The threat of violence
leading to cardiac arrest.

272
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:21,895
These old birds, they spook.
Just say boo at them.

273
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:26,400
And with death on deck
and a contained environment...

274
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:29,029
they freak fucking out.

275
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:31,823
I've seen it, it's grim.

276
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:43,002
I could show you something very terrible,
if you'd like.

277
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:50,676
What happened to them?

278
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,721
Oh, just that they died.

279
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,433
- We've been at sea for three days.
- Two bodies a day.

280
00:27:57,017 --> 00:27:59,645
That's the industry standard
for an Atlantic crossing.

281
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:07,236
I don't want any.

282
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,155
- But you have to.
- Why?

283
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,950
Because it's fun.

284
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:15,370
You and me, drinking drinks.

285
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,211
Thank you for showing me all of this.
I won't tell anyone about it.

286
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:24,672
Yeah, tell who you want.

287
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:36,977
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
Your attention, please.</i>

288
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:39,062
<i>Welcome to France.</i>

289
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:43,067
<i>And thank you for sailing
with</i> Sovereign Star Cruises.

290
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:01,735
Here's our jailbird now.

291
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:04,989
Here I am.

292
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:08,368
And you've paid your debt to society?

293
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,246
How did you even know to tell her?

294
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:17,002
I've always been able to see
what is gonna happen.

295
00:30:17,753 --> 00:30:19,880
- Towards the end, a color comes.
- What color?

296
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:22,633
Green.

297
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:24,843
It's your little witchy friend.

298
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:27,096
How do you do?

299
00:30:27,846 --> 00:30:31,017
Hi. Hope you haven't lost that cat.

300
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:37,440
He's having his siesta
until we get through customs.

301
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:46,075
What is the purpose of your trip?

302
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:50,496
We're vacationists.
I wanna see the Eiffel Tower and die.

303
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,416
Madame?

304
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,712
Chasing after youthful fantasies.

305
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:43,577
- I can't sleep.
- Me neither.

306
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:31,004
It's cold.

307
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:52,903
We're ready for the bill.

308
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:55,280
Yes, yes. Soon, buddy.

309
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:56,490
Soon. Okay?

310
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,506
Madame!

311
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,053
What are you doing? You're fucking crazy.

312
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,889
The check, please.

313
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:01,184
You're insane. Get the fire extinguisher!

314
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:00,499
For walking around.

315
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,716
Did you know it's Christmas Eve?

316
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:36,496
Come and get it away from me.

317
00:36:37,914 --> 00:36:39,290
Christ, I'm dying!

318
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:01,106
Oh, don't you like it?

319
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:09,806
- What is it?
- An invitation to a party.

320
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:12,850
"Madame Reynard." Who is she?

321
00:38:14,227 --> 00:38:16,188
She likes her exclamation points.

322
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:29,327
{\an8}Your father and I stayed around here
in a hotel for our honeymoon.

323
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:33,164
I can't imagine you two on a honeymoon.

324
00:38:33,832 --> 00:38:36,584
Yeah. It was all the normal things.

325
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:41,549
Hotels and the flowers and the champagne.

326
00:38:42,717 --> 00:38:45,011
It's strange to think he was actually fun.

327
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:48,889
But in the beginning, he really was.

328
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:57,816
Hey! You made it.

329
00:38:58,817 --> 00:39:02,362
Come in! Let me take your coats.

330
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,164
Thank you.

331
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,500
We're not early.

332
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:17,463
No! You're right on time.

333
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:20,341
But where are the others?

334
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,300
It's just us.

335
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:25,054
Would either of you like a martini?
I've been waiting all day for mine.

336
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:27,974
- I would like a martini.
- All right.

337
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,601
Frances?

338
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:38,151
What the fuck is going on here?

339
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:40,655
My husband died this summer.

340
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:45,660
After, I realized that our friends
were actually his.

341
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:49,747
And not only that I didn't like them,
but they didn't like me either.

342
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:54,920
I don't miss them particularly,
but I miss the noise they made.

343
00:39:55,003 --> 00:39:56,463
That's why I invited you over.

344
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:58,840
You want us to make noise.

345
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:03,637
No.

346
00:40:05,223 --> 00:40:07,266
I'm lonely.

347
00:40:09,394 --> 00:40:11,854
- How'd he die?
- He choked to death.

348
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:15,233
That's a new one.

349
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,530
Please don't be cruel to me.

350
00:40:19,613 --> 00:40:22,408
It was difficult to get up the nerve
to ask you over.

351
00:40:22,491 --> 00:40:23,909
I suppose I...

352
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:27,413
I don't see why we're here, is all.

353
00:40:27,496 --> 00:40:30,375
Well, just I was curious to meet you.
Of course, I know who you are.

354
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:34,546
I grew up in New York City, and, you know,
we're the same age, about,

355
00:40:34,629 --> 00:40:37,257
and we just thought you were so wonderful,
my friends and I.

356
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,591
So wonderful.

357
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:41,762
And when I'd heard you'd come to Paris,
I thought we might become friends.

358
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:44,932
I appreciate that.

359
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:49,061
But the fact is, I've no need of friends
in my life at the moment.

360
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:57,404
Well...

361
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:02,492
I'm sorry to hear that's the way you feel.

362
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,955
But you're here now...

363
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,709
and I've made a cassoulet
and I vote we make the best of it.

364
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:10,877
What do you think?

365
00:41:13,046 --> 00:41:15,214
Malcolm, shall we make the best of it?

366
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:16,842
Of course.

367
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:19,178
Would you like another martini
before the wine?

368
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:22,598
- Yes, please.
- Okay. All right.

369
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:30,899
You're being a dick.

370
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:32,525
Isn't it awful?

371
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:39,784
All right, I'll stop. I'm sorry.

372
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:49,335
You know, he died in that very chair.

373
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:53,840
Here.

374
00:41:57,803 --> 00:42:02,391
- What, may I ask, did he choke on?
- Lamb.

375
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,480
And have you eaten lamb since?

376
00:42:07,563 --> 00:42:11,651
No, but, you know, I never liked lamb much
in the first place.

377
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:14,278
Yeah. No. I don't either.

378
00:42:14,362 --> 00:42:19,493
The gamey meats somehow
summon the fact of the animal's existence,

379
00:42:19,576 --> 00:42:22,871
which puts me in mind of its death.

380
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:29,379
- I've never thought of it before.
- Whereas a steak is simply a steak.

381
00:42:29,462 --> 00:42:31,756
Yes. That's right.

382
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,985
I was just going to use
the powder room myself.

383
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,279
I won't be a moment.

384
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,958
Go look in the freezer.

385
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:06,210
What?

386
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:07,670
- Go look.
- Why?

387
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:10,006
Go look.

388
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:41,832
I've never understood them.

389
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,126
What's to understand?

390
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:52,344
Is it something one uses alone,
or with someone there to help?

391
00:43:52,427 --> 00:43:53,637
Either or.

392
00:43:59,226 --> 00:44:01,436
But why would you want it cold?

393
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,565
That's the mystery.

394
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:16,954
I'm a little crocked, I think.

395
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,916
Malcolm, would you mind
serving the cassoulet?

396
00:44:22,418 --> 00:44:25,462
Thank you. I'll scald myself if I try.

397
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:27,423
Everything's ready for you in the kitchen.

398
00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:43,357
Becomes like water, doesn't it?

399
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:45,943
It's better than water.

400
00:44:55,078 --> 00:44:57,372
Can I share a recollection I have of you?

401
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:00,375
All right.

402
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:04,130
It was about a dozen years ago,

403
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:06,674
in the months after your husband's death.

404
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:14,474
I was eating with a group at Le Circe,
and a man at my table

405
00:45:14,557 --> 00:45:19,146
was speaking poorly
of your husband when you came in.

406
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:23,192
You looked so smart.
I couldn't help but stare.

407
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:29,866
Then you passed by the table,
and the man stopped you

408
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:34,621
and said, "Mrs. Price,
I knew your husband well,

409
00:45:34,704 --> 00:45:39,125
and it's all I can do
not to dance on his grave."

410
00:45:39,209 --> 00:45:40,544
Do you remember it?

411
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:43,339
No. I don't.

412
00:45:43,422 --> 00:45:45,132
Really?

413
00:45:45,216 --> 00:45:47,385
And what did I say to him?

414
00:45:47,468 --> 00:45:49,720
That's the thing.

415
00:45:49,804 --> 00:45:53,767
You didn't say a word.
You drank his drink.

416
00:45:54,768 --> 00:46:01,108
Straight Scotch, and you stared at him

417
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,776
with a look of...

418
00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:07,073
absolute indifference.

419
00:46:07,156 --> 00:46:12,829
The poor man didn't know what to do.

420
00:46:12,912 --> 00:46:16,959
He was so ashamed.

421
00:46:26,427 --> 00:46:28,638
I'm sorry I was rude to you.

422
00:46:33,935 --> 00:46:35,854
My life has...

423
00:46:38,314 --> 00:46:40,484
fallen completely to pieces.

424
00:46:41,152 --> 00:46:46,073
And I'm upset about it.

425
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:53,832
I... I know just what you mean.

426
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,793
I'm sure you do.

427
00:46:58,253 --> 00:47:00,297
Oh, here comes Malcolm.

428
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:03,718
Sustenance!

429
00:48:08,663 --> 00:48:10,832
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hi, Sudsy.</i>

430
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:12,875
<i>What are you doing?</i>

431
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:16,171
<i>It's 6:30 in the morning.</i>

432
00:48:16,672 --> 00:48:17,715
Right.

433
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:20,008
Shit. I'm sorry.

434
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:22,886
<i>Where are you?</i>

435
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,847
I'm by the canal.

436
00:48:27,392 --> 00:48:30,478
I'm calling because I wanted
to hear your voice.

437
00:48:30,562 --> 00:48:33,898
- <i>Here it is. Here's my voice.</i>
- <i>I'm out.</i>

438
00:48:34,983 --> 00:48:36,526
Who's that?

439
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:37,777
<i>Tom. Wait.</i>

440
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:40,823
<i>Good luck today.</i>

441
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:46,078
<i>Good going, Malcolm.</i>

442
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:51,793
<i>Were you expecting me
to mourn my loss in perpetuity?</i>

443
00:48:52,753 --> 00:48:54,004
Yes, I was.

444
00:48:54,087 --> 00:48:58,133
<i>Well, it's beyond all reason for you
to try and make me feel bad about this,</i>

445
00:48:58,216 --> 00:48:59,134
<i>so don't you dare.</i>

446
00:48:59,217 --> 00:49:01,219
Fine. But...

447
00:49:03,514 --> 00:49:05,600
Who is this person?

448
00:49:05,683 --> 00:49:09,854
<i>Tom. I've told you about Tom before.
He was my fiancé in college.</i>

449
00:49:15,736 --> 00:49:17,821
What were you wishing him luck for?

450
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:19,907
<i>He has an important meeting today.</i>

451
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,700
Oh, an important meeting?

452
00:49:21,784 --> 00:49:24,703
- That sounds important.
- <i>Enough, Malcolm.</i>

453
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,625
<i>Listen, he says he wants to marry me.</i>

454
00:49:38,218 --> 00:49:39,804
<i>Hello?</i>

455
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:49,730
- Do you wanna come visit me in Paris?
- <i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

456
00:49:49,814 --> 00:49:53,402
Yeah, I heard you.
But you're already engaged to me.

457
00:49:54,778 --> 00:49:57,280
That's polygamy. It's illegal.

458
00:49:57,364 --> 00:49:59,116
- <i>Malcolm.</i>
- It's a felony.

459
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,659
- <i>Malcolm.</i>
- What?

460
00:50:00,742 --> 00:50:02,244
<i>Will you...?</i>

461
00:50:02,327 --> 00:50:08,000
<i>Can you please not call here?
At least not for a while?</i>

462
00:50:08,084 --> 00:50:10,294
<i>I've been feeling better
in the last couple weeks,</i>

463
00:50:10,378 --> 00:50:12,880
<i>and I'd appreciate
you keeping some distance.</i>

464
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,554
<i>Hello?</i>

465
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:42,853
Is he back yet?

466
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:44,563
No.

467
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:47,525
Does that hurt?

468
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:49,026
No.

469
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,240
Thank you.

470
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:56,493
What are you thanking me for?

471
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:54,306
Perhaps you could take
Small Frank's departure

472
00:52:54,389 --> 00:52:58,226
as a signal to welcome
another animal into your lives.

473
00:52:59,603 --> 00:53:02,355
A kitten is an agent of great good.

474
00:53:02,439 --> 00:53:06,569
I didn't want a cat in the first place.
I don't like cats.

475
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:11,741
It was only that Small Frank
impressed himself upon us,

476
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:14,327
and there was nothing to do
but endure him.

477
00:53:15,871 --> 00:53:19,208
All right, but if you feel that way,
and now that he's run off,

478
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:20,626
can't you simply let him go?

479
00:53:20,709 --> 00:53:22,419
No!

480
00:53:27,592 --> 00:53:29,552
I've upset your mother.

481
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:33,264
Well, she's upset in the general sense.

482
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:37,644
We're out of champagne.

483
00:53:38,353 --> 00:53:45,152
Do you ever feel that you've had adulthood
thrust upon you at too young an age

484
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:51,243
and that you're still
essentially a child...

485
00:53:52,244 --> 00:53:56,164
mimicking the behaviors
of the grown-ups all around you,

486
00:53:56,248 --> 00:54:00,919
so they won't uncover
the meager contents of your heart?

487
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:05,341
The witch you fucked on the boat!

488
00:54:07,301 --> 00:54:10,179
Malcolm fucked a witch on the boat over.

489
00:54:11,097 --> 00:54:13,975
She understood him, didn't she?

490
00:54:14,058 --> 00:54:15,102
I think she did.

491
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,311
Well?

492
00:54:16,395 --> 00:54:18,564
Why can't we ask her where he is?

493
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:23,152
I don't know that she'd know,
and I don't know how we'd find her either.

494
00:54:23,235 --> 00:54:26,739
I would like for one of you to
please explain what you're talking about.

495
00:54:26,822 --> 00:54:29,492
Well, the fucked witch
and Small Frank were connected.

496
00:54:29,576 --> 00:54:31,619
Let's not call her that.

497
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:33,788
She understood about him.

498
00:54:33,872 --> 00:54:37,333
What is there to understand
about Small Frank, exactly?

499
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:40,129
I'm puzzled,
and this is what's puzzling me.

500
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:50,389
It's not something we typically discuss.

501
00:54:51,016 --> 00:54:54,269
But the long and short of it is...

502
00:54:55,562 --> 00:54:58,774
that my dead husband
lives inside of that cat.

503
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:02,861
Is that a fact?

504
00:55:02,945 --> 00:55:05,656
- An unfortunate fact.
- How do you know this?

505
00:55:06,491 --> 00:55:07,784
It's an understood thing.

506
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:09,285
Can you make it understood to me?

507
00:55:09,368 --> 00:55:12,872
I don't know. I wish you'd be good
and take my word for it.

508
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:17,503
I'll try.

509
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:26,053
Frank ran away because I told him
something he didn't like.

510
00:55:26,428 --> 00:55:27,597
And what was that?

511
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:33,520
I'm sorry, but I choose not to say.

512
00:55:36,606 --> 00:55:42,196
Anyway, I believe she might be able
to help and that we should seek her out.

513
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:44,907
- Seek out the fucked witch?
- That's right.

514
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,660
Let's find something besides that
to call her.

515
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:50,079
How do we find her, is the question.

516
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,461
I got it!

517
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:02,467
Private investigator.

518
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:05,513
Who may I do what for?

519
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:09,434
I and my son need to find a girl,
a young woman.

520
00:56:09,517 --> 00:56:14,230
She's a clairvoyant from the United States
living in Paris.

521
00:56:14,313 --> 00:56:18,485
Or is she not living here,
but visiting, Malcolm?

522
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:22,281
- I don't know.
- Anyway, she's around.

523
00:56:22,364 --> 00:56:25,242
What is your relationship
to this woman, madame?

524
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:27,829
None whatsoever.

525
00:56:27,912 --> 00:56:29,914
My son knows her, though, carnally.

526
00:56:42,428 --> 00:56:45,473
It can be helpful for me to understand

527
00:56:45,556 --> 00:56:48,893
the nature of your desire
to find this person.

528
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,271
Well...

529
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:55,150
we've lost our cat.

530
00:56:55,233 --> 00:56:56,318
Yes?

531
00:56:56,401 --> 00:57:02,950
And this woman, we believe, might be
of some assistance in locating him.

532
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:05,036
She knows the cat's whereabouts?

533
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,206
Not at the moment,
but it's come to our attention

534
00:57:08,289 --> 00:57:14,045
that this woman can speak to the cat
in her mind, you see.

535
00:57:22,137 --> 00:57:24,515
What is the name of this woman?

536
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:27,227
Madeleine.

537
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,853
We don't know her surname.

538
00:57:33,066 --> 00:57:36,861
- This is far too much, madame.
- Keep it. It's like a tip.

539
00:57:36,945 --> 00:57:39,990
Just you find our little witch for us,
all right?

540
00:57:40,408 --> 00:57:41,909
All right.

541
00:58:22,244 --> 00:58:24,496
<i>I saw a man's penis yesterday.</i>

542
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,916
<i>It was pissing in the park
opposite the apartment.</i>

543
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,837
<i>Have you noticed men simply
take them out and use them here?</i>

544
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:36,593
<i>There's no harm in it, I suppose,
but it does take some getting used to.</i>

545
00:58:36,676 --> 00:58:39,513
<i>Yesterday's was memorably large.</i>

546
00:58:39,597 --> 00:58:44,602
<i>What a gift that must be for a man.
What a lottery life is.</i>

547
00:58:45,728 --> 00:58:47,855
<i>It was nice to see it, I'll admit.</i>

548
00:58:49,231 --> 00:58:54,613
<i>Oh, Joan... When the money runs out,
I'm going to kill myself.</i>

549
00:58:54,696 --> 00:58:57,866
<i>But I want you to know
that you were the only one,</i>

550
00:58:57,949 --> 00:59:03,372
<i>other than Frank, when he was himself,
and Malcolm.</i>

551
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:07,210
<i>Please, will you take care of him,
if you can, somehow?</i>

552
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,962
<i>I've always admired your heart.</i>

553
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,507
<i>Your heart is the rightest of all.</i>

554
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:06,691
Madame, this is too much.

555
01:00:30,508 --> 01:00:32,761
I don't know who's famous anymore.

556
01:00:33,219 --> 01:00:35,722
These people are all strangers to me.

557
01:01:24,858 --> 01:01:25,692
Entrée!

558
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:41,710
Would you mind telling me the story?

559
01:01:43,504 --> 01:01:44,380
All right.

560
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:48,843
Well, I was...

561
01:01:49,677 --> 01:01:52,180
I was leaving for Vail that weekend,

562
01:01:52,264 --> 01:01:57,477
and the car was idling in the street,
and the driver was loading up my luggage.

563
01:01:58,228 --> 01:02:00,355
And I remember thinking,

564
01:02:00,439 --> 01:02:05,027
it was silly to explain to Frank
that I was going because he wouldn't care.

565
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:07,029
And what was the point?

566
01:02:10,408 --> 01:02:13,035
But I decided I would tell him.

567
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,705
And...

568
01:02:15,706 --> 01:02:20,461
<i>up the stairs I went, and he was dead...</i>

569
01:02:23,464 --> 01:02:24,756
<i>in our bed.</i>

570
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,386
There was a cat...

571
01:02:29,804 --> 01:02:32,432
sitting on his chest.

572
01:02:36,561 --> 01:02:38,898
<i>Licking his face.</i>

573
01:02:38,981 --> 01:02:43,152
<i>Making the most awful noise.</i>

574
01:02:46,322 --> 01:02:51,161
I couldn't seem to feel anything
but a sense of hopelessness and...

575
01:02:52,162 --> 01:02:55,332
I mean, that there was nothing to be done.

576
01:02:57,501 --> 01:03:03,132
<i>And then came the feeling
of just wishing to go.</i>

577
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:07,345
<i>Then needing to.</i>

578
01:03:11,891 --> 01:03:15,562
When I returned Monday evening,
he was exactly where I left him,

579
01:03:15,646 --> 01:03:19,274
only he was blown up like a balloon,

580
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:21,110
and the color of one too.

581
01:03:22,361 --> 01:03:25,322
Well, I called the paramedics,
who called the police.

582
01:03:27,283 --> 01:03:29,786
When I returned home from the precinct...

583
01:03:33,373 --> 01:03:36,793
paparazzi were on the stoop.

584
01:03:36,876 --> 01:03:38,419
And so was the cat.

585
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:43,926
He followed me inside
as though it was a natural thing.

586
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:48,013
I knew just to look at him.

587
01:04:09,537 --> 01:04:11,289
<i>Franklin?</i>

588
01:04:12,123 --> 01:04:13,207
<i>Franklin?</i>

589
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,170
<i>Are you there?</i>

590
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:19,590
<i>We're here with you, Franklin.</i>

591
01:04:22,176 --> 01:04:24,428
Won't you please speak with us?

592
01:04:34,606 --> 01:04:36,107
<i>Who are you?</i>

593
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:39,945
Madeleine.

594
01:04:40,946 --> 01:04:43,365
We met on the boat on the way to France.

595
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:44,533
Do you remember?

596
01:04:46,035 --> 01:04:47,453
<i>What do you want?</i>

597
01:04:47,536 --> 01:04:48,996
Just to speak with you.

598
01:04:50,164 --> 01:04:52,209
I'm here with Frances and Malcolm.

599
01:04:52,876 --> 01:04:54,169
Hello, Frank.

600
01:04:55,754 --> 01:04:56,755
<i>Hello.</i>

601
01:04:56,838 --> 01:04:57,798
How are you?

602
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,342
<i>Well, you know.</i>

603
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:03,137
<i>Malcolm?</i>

604
01:05:03,221 --> 01:05:04,555
Yeah, Dad?

605
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:06,474
<i>What's this all about?</i>

606
01:05:06,557 --> 01:05:07,642
All what about?

607
01:05:07,725 --> 01:05:09,393
<i>The hocus-pocus.</i>

608
01:05:11,395 --> 01:05:13,731
Just that you ran off, you know?

609
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:17,402
We were curious where you'd gone off to.

610
01:05:17,486 --> 01:05:19,071
<i>No one place.</i>

611
01:05:19,154 --> 01:05:20,906
<i>I'm behaving nomadically.</i>

612
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:23,117
You're living by your wits. I admire that.

613
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,785
<i>Who said that?</i>

614
01:05:24,868 --> 01:05:28,414
Madame Reynard is my name.
I'm so very happy to meet you.

615
01:05:28,498 --> 01:05:31,042
I'm a great friend of your wife and son.

616
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:34,170
Honestly, they've had
a remarkable influence on me.

617
01:05:34,254 --> 01:05:36,631
I believe that friendship
is a greater force for good

618
01:05:36,714 --> 01:05:39,260
than any religion ever was.
Don't you agree?

619
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,888
<i>Frances, please.</i>

620
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,144
Why'd you run away, Dad?

621
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,355
<i>Good question.</i>

622
01:05:50,438 --> 01:05:51,940
<i>Great question.</i>

623
01:05:52,023 --> 01:05:53,817
<i>Why don't you ask your mother?</i>

624
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,277
Why did Dad run away?

625
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:03,828
- It's pretty complicated.
- <i>It's not that complicated.</i>

626
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:06,038
Where are you, Frank?

627
01:06:06,122 --> 01:06:10,042
<i>I choose not to answer that.
Does anyone wanna know why?</i>

628
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:12,003
- I do.
- I do.

629
01:06:16,383 --> 01:06:17,759
I do too.

630
01:06:17,843 --> 01:06:19,261
I do and I don't.

631
01:06:19,344 --> 01:06:24,266
<i>It's just a small matter of Frances'
intention to kill me with her bare hands.</i>

632
01:06:42,787 --> 01:06:43,788
<i>Hey, Malcolm.</i>

633
01:06:43,871 --> 01:06:45,080
Yes, Dad?

634
01:06:45,164 --> 01:06:49,168
<i>What do you think of all this?
Your mother wants to kill your father?</i>

635
01:06:49,251 --> 01:06:50,252
Yeah.

636
01:06:51,463 --> 01:06:52,798
<i>Any thoughts on it?</i>

637
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,510
To be honest, Dad...

638
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,640
I'd just as soon not get involved.

639
01:07:01,765 --> 01:07:05,728
<i>Nice. That's nice. That's family for you.</i>

640
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:09,232
I guess what I mean to say, Dad,

641
01:07:09,315 --> 01:07:13,653
is I don't think it's really fair for you
to ask me to weigh in on this,

642
01:07:13,736 --> 01:07:16,406
considering the fact
that I don't know who you are,

643
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:20,202
have never known who you are,
and not because I didn't want to,

644
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:23,914
but because you never so much as
parted the curtain for me.

645
01:07:23,997 --> 01:07:27,961
Never showed me the slightest preference
or kindness,

646
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,547
even as a child, when I worshiped you.

647
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:34,592
All I ever wished for was for you
to take me by the hand and walk me

648
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:39,140
through any motherfucking park,
pat me on the fucking head.

649
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:44,520
For chrissakes, was I that repellent
a creature to you?

650
01:08:10,882 --> 01:08:12,633
<i>What's eating him?</i>

651
01:08:12,717 --> 01:08:17,181
He just told you what's eating him, Frank.
He hates you.

652
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:20,350
<i>Fuck you.</i>

653
01:09:42,148 --> 01:09:43,566
The woman in the window.

654
01:09:50,198 --> 01:09:52,324
Can I offer you an orange, madame?

655
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:56,121
No, thank you.

656
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:06,632
Forgive me for my state.
I am normally quite handsome.

657
01:10:07,466 --> 01:10:10,219
Not just my friends would say it.

658
01:10:12,054 --> 01:10:15,976
Do you know,
I saw what happened yesterday.

659
01:10:16,059 --> 01:10:17,603
Is that right?

660
01:10:17,686 --> 01:10:19,938
What did you make of it?

661
01:10:21,315 --> 01:10:25,569
Just that I thought
you behaved very bravely.

662
01:10:30,742 --> 01:10:32,994
How is it that you're not in jail?

663
01:10:37,874 --> 01:10:39,251
Thick wrists, madame.

664
01:10:40,711 --> 01:10:43,672
I just slip out of my handcuffs,
like Billy the Kid.

665
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:50,055
I've changed my mind about the orange.

666
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:55,101
Only the finest orange for you, madame.

667
01:10:56,561 --> 01:11:00,232
The finest, most delectable orange
in the sack.

668
01:11:00,315 --> 01:11:02,443
For you, my guest.

669
01:11:03,736 --> 01:11:07,198
The mysterious,
beautiful woman in the window.

670
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:11,035
Hold your hand.

671
01:11:17,584 --> 01:11:20,420
May I have some of your orange, madame?

672
01:11:44,738 --> 01:11:46,448
I'm very ill.

673
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:53,039
I haven't got much longer to live,
actually.

674
01:11:53,748 --> 01:11:58,253
You'd be doing me a great favor
if you would accept this.

675
01:12:00,005 --> 01:12:00,839
Why?

676
01:12:00,922 --> 01:12:02,550
It would make me happy.

677
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,322
- Won't you take it all?
- No.

678
01:12:23,989 --> 01:12:25,407
See that man over there?

679
01:12:32,999 --> 01:12:33,958
He'll take your money.

680
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:31,294
Where is she?

681
01:14:31,377 --> 01:14:32,378
In the bath.

682
01:14:39,053 --> 01:14:40,054
What?

683
01:14:58,365 --> 01:15:00,408
How long will you be staying in Paris?

684
01:15:02,703 --> 01:15:03,996
I...

685
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:07,041
I can't say.

686
01:15:09,544 --> 01:15:12,630
- May I ask who you are?
- Madame Reynard is my name.

687
01:15:13,673 --> 01:15:14,633
How do you do?

688
01:15:14,716 --> 01:15:15,801
I do well.

689
01:15:15,884 --> 01:15:17,386
In fact, I do very well.

690
01:15:19,888 --> 01:15:21,640
Where will you be staying?

691
01:15:21,723 --> 01:15:25,310
It can be difficult finding a hotel
at the last minute.

692
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,231
This is my apartment.

693
01:15:30,942 --> 01:15:33,862
Who is this horrible woman in my home?

694
01:15:35,196 --> 01:15:38,450
Give her a chance. She isn't so bad.

695
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:42,121
Since when do you humor your admirers?

696
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,748
Strange, isn't it?

697
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:51,631
Perhaps I'm simply tired.
Yes, I think that's what it is.

698
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:52,966
And this?

699
01:16:02,852 --> 01:16:06,355
Well, I have no idea how that was sent.

700
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:10,276
Its delivery doesn't concern me
so much as its contents.

701
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:13,279
A low day, and the mood has passed.

702
01:16:13,362 --> 01:16:14,990
Has it?

703
01:16:15,073 --> 01:16:16,658
Yes, dear.

704
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:26,878
It's very nice to meet you.

705
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:30,173
- Likewise. It's a pleasure meeting you.
- I slept in.

706
01:16:32,091 --> 01:16:33,259
Who are you?

707
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:38,766
Ballpark figure,
how many people are staying here?

708
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:41,268
This is it.

709
01:16:41,852 --> 01:16:43,354
Entrée!

710
01:16:57,202 --> 01:16:58,453
Well...

711
01:16:58,537 --> 01:17:01,540
But this is everyone. I promise.

712
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:13,678
Oh, before I met Susan, I thought
I knew what it was to be in love.

713
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,222
Said it and meant it.

714
01:17:15,305 --> 01:17:17,766
Heard it said to me, and so glad to know.

715
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:22,145
But what are those feelings
compared to this?

716
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:27,527
This, this is something else.
This is a love poets aspire to.

717
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:30,238
- Are you a poet?
- I work in finance.

718
01:17:30,822 --> 01:17:34,993
There is, I feel,
a certain poetry in numbers.

719
01:17:35,076 --> 01:17:35,910
Gross.

720
01:17:35,994 --> 01:17:37,370
What'd you say?

721
01:17:37,453 --> 01:17:39,123
I said, gross.

722
01:17:40,457 --> 01:17:44,003
I asked Susan to marry me,
and it was looking good.

723
01:17:44,086 --> 01:17:46,922
Then she gets this early-morning
telephone call.

724
01:17:48,215 --> 01:17:50,552
Since she hung up the phone,
I've been playing catch-up,

725
01:17:50,635 --> 01:17:52,637
trying to figure out what she wants.

726
01:17:52,721 --> 01:17:56,349
And if I'm not mistaken, she wants him.

727
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:57,517
Well?

728
01:17:57,601 --> 01:17:59,060
I thought I was happy.

729
01:17:59,144 --> 01:18:01,731
I was happy.

730
01:18:01,814 --> 01:18:04,525
But then Malcolm called, and...

731
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:08,529
now I don't know what I'm doing.

732
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:12,158
What am I doing, Malcolm?

733
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:21,251
I wonder if you could take your head out
of your ass for just the briefest moment!

734
01:18:21,335 --> 01:18:22,169
Wait.

735
01:18:23,253 --> 01:18:24,588
It's a complicated situation,

736
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:27,258
but I believe we can express
our respective points of view

737
01:18:27,342 --> 01:18:28,927
while maintaining our dignity.

738
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:31,221
- Bravo.
- Which isn't to say we hide our emotions.

739
01:18:31,304 --> 01:18:32,222
Oh, never.

740
01:18:32,305 --> 01:18:37,393
For example,
I feel that I could kill Malcolm.

741
01:18:38,395 --> 01:18:41,023
Actually murder him, here and now.

742
01:18:41,106 --> 01:18:44,485
But, no, I won't do that.

743
01:18:45,736 --> 01:18:48,572
- You're lucky.
- I've always been lucky.

744
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:50,534
Have you?

745
01:18:51,826 --> 01:18:54,913
I've been neither lucky nor unlucky.

746
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:56,831
I've been luckless.

747
01:18:56,915 --> 01:18:59,042
I've been incredibly lucky at times and...

748
01:19:00,043 --> 01:19:03,005
well, tragically unlucky at others.

749
01:19:03,089 --> 01:19:05,174
I've only been unlucky.

750
01:19:05,258 --> 01:19:09,470
But I have a sense that this will change
suddenly and permanently.

751
01:19:09,554 --> 01:19:11,347
Anyway, that's what I tell myself.

752
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:18,313
I've only been unlucky,
and I believe I will always be.

753
01:19:26,865 --> 01:19:29,158
It's not big enough for the two of us.

754
01:19:29,242 --> 01:19:31,536
No, it's not.

755
01:19:38,836 --> 01:19:40,045
I talk in my sleep.

756
01:19:41,171 --> 01:19:43,173
That's all right.

757
01:19:47,887 --> 01:19:50,849
Also, I gnash my teeth.

758
01:19:50,932 --> 01:19:51,933
All right.

759
01:19:56,313 --> 01:19:59,774
And I have sleep apnea,
and sometimes I sleepwalk.

760
01:19:59,858 --> 01:20:02,695
If you see me set out to wander,
you mustn't wake me.

761
01:20:02,778 --> 01:20:03,779
Okay.

762
01:20:05,406 --> 01:20:07,992
Sweet dreams, Madame Reynard.

763
01:20:37,357 --> 01:20:40,778
We're just two...

764
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:44,365
Two little old ladies.

765
01:21:52,314 --> 01:21:54,649
Saffron is not on the list.

766
01:21:54,733 --> 01:21:56,359
It's a needed thing.

767
01:21:56,985 --> 01:21:58,278
Three bottles?

768
01:21:58,361 --> 01:22:01,866
We'll use it, later or sooner.

769
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:14,546
Darling, would you please
grab us a cheese plate?

770
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:22,471
Pardon.

771
01:22:23,597 --> 01:22:27,310
Do you have something for...

772
01:22:28,019 --> 01:22:29,062
Five hundred?

773
01:22:29,938 --> 01:22:32,398
- Case or bottle?
- Bottle.

774
01:22:39,365 --> 01:22:41,825
€2012.73, please.

775
01:22:43,494 --> 01:22:45,454
We'll need these delivered.
Is that all right?

776
01:22:47,206 --> 01:22:48,832
<i>Oui,</i> madame.

777
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:55,715
I told Don I had to run to Paris
because I thought you might kill yourself.

778
01:22:55,799 --> 01:22:57,884
He was fiddling with the remote.

779
01:22:57,968 --> 01:23:01,556
He told me, "Tell her hello
if you get there in time."

780
01:23:06,394 --> 01:23:08,354
I had a moment earlier this year...

781
01:23:08,938 --> 01:23:13,276
when I realized, you get older,
you don't even want love.

782
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:16,488
Not the kind we believed in
when we were younger.

783
01:23:16,572 --> 01:23:18,615
Who has the energy for that?

784
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:21,493
When I think of the way
we used to carry on about it.

785
01:23:21,577 --> 01:23:22,703
I know.

786
01:23:22,786 --> 01:23:25,665
Men and women throwing themselves
out of windows.

787
01:23:26,666 --> 01:23:29,502
What you want is to know someone's there.

788
01:23:29,586 --> 01:23:32,380
But you also want them to leave you alone.

789
01:23:32,463 --> 01:23:34,132
I have that with Don.

790
01:23:35,466 --> 01:23:37,636
We allow ourselves contentment...

791
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:42,308
and the heart brings us ease
in its good time.

792
01:23:44,977 --> 01:23:46,353
It's a nice thought.

793
01:23:48,022 --> 01:23:49,399
You don't agree with me?

794
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:54,237
It hasn't been that way for me.

795
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,201
I'm sorry.

796
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,955
I just find the whole thing
so contemptuous.

797
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:09,795
The very idea of a suicide note.
The idea of suicide, coming from you.

798
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:13,800
And it's such a cliché, isn't it?

799
01:24:13,884 --> 01:24:15,844
Someone so bright and promising

800
01:24:15,928 --> 01:24:19,097
killing themselves
after the glamour has passed.

801
01:24:21,808 --> 01:24:22,809
Well...

802
01:24:24,645 --> 01:24:25,688
for one...

803
01:24:28,024 --> 01:24:31,694
that's an extremely shitty thing
to say to me.

804
01:24:34,656 --> 01:24:35,782
Two...

805
01:24:37,283 --> 01:24:41,664
the glamour passed a long time ago,
and you know very well that it did.

806
01:24:43,499 --> 01:24:44,333
Third...

807
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:47,336
Three, yes...

808
01:24:48,212 --> 01:24:52,634
my life is riddled by clichés.

809
01:24:54,177 --> 01:24:56,471
But you know what a cliché is?

810
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:03,020
It's a story so fine and thrilling

811
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:07,233
that it's grown old
in its hopeful retelling.

812
01:25:11,028 --> 01:25:12,321
People tell it.

813
01:25:14,074 --> 01:25:16,159
Not so many live it.

814
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:24,084
<i>Two, three, go.</i>

815
01:25:25,461 --> 01:25:29,674
I can't claim to know
either of you well, or at all.

816
01:25:30,675 --> 01:25:33,344
But I see
you're above such petty jealousies.

817
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:36,389
Ugliness begets ugliness.

818
01:25:36,472 --> 01:25:39,101
I volunteer we strive for grace.

819
01:25:39,184 --> 01:25:41,812
Neither of us is bothered, Madame Reynard.

820
01:25:42,813 --> 01:25:46,442
You say that,
but obviously you don't mean it.

821
01:25:46,525 --> 01:25:49,279
But I'm not in love with Malcolm.

822
01:25:50,363 --> 01:25:53,408
To be honest,
I don't even like him very much.

823
01:25:57,162 --> 01:25:58,163
Malcolm.

824
01:26:05,546 --> 01:26:06,380
Ready?

825
01:26:07,882 --> 01:26:09,300
Go.

826
01:26:10,551 --> 01:26:11,761
- You win.
- Come on!

827
01:26:13,012 --> 01:26:14,014
Do it right.

828
01:26:22,064 --> 01:26:26,694
- Two, three, go!
- He's not even trying.

829
01:26:26,778 --> 01:26:30,406
- You're the big winner.
- It's not winning if I win like that.

830
01:26:41,335 --> 01:26:42,461
If I win...

831
01:26:44,129 --> 01:26:48,008
you take your bags, and you leave, alone.

832
01:26:54,683 --> 01:26:55,559
Okay.

833
01:26:59,271 --> 01:27:00,647
Ready?

834
01:27:02,358 --> 01:27:05,278
Two, three, go!

835
01:27:11,409 --> 01:27:12,243
Wait a minute.

836
01:27:13,035 --> 01:27:15,372
- What did I win?
- Nothing.

837
01:27:15,622 --> 01:27:19,209
Everything is exactly the same
as it was before.

838
01:27:21,003 --> 01:27:22,004
This...

839
01:27:22,671 --> 01:27:27,635
This reminds me of the performance artist
I saw on the television.

840
01:27:28,052 --> 01:27:31,347
She walked the length
of the Great Wall of China.

841
01:27:31,973 --> 01:27:34,767
Then she broke up with her boyfriend,

842
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:41,233
and then people paid good money
to see her go to the bathroom in a bucket.

843
01:27:41,817 --> 01:27:44,028
In a museum.

844
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:49,242
I used to worry about my
not understanding modern art.

845
01:27:54,122 --> 01:27:55,790
I don't like you people.

846
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:59,628
I don't like these people.
They're not normal people.

847
01:27:59,711 --> 01:28:03,799
Couldn't you please find it in your heart
to like us just a little bit?

848
01:28:03,883 --> 01:28:05,301
No.

849
01:28:06,302 --> 01:28:07,678
Where's your bag?

850
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,934
Time to say goodbye, Susan.

851
01:28:15,646 --> 01:28:17,731
- Susan?
- Tom...

852
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,115
We're leaving, Susan.

853
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:28,534
You go ahead.

854
01:28:29,744 --> 01:28:31,955
No, I'm really gonna go.

855
01:28:32,038 --> 01:28:33,706
This is your last chance.

856
01:28:34,999 --> 01:28:36,793
It's now or never.

857
01:28:36,876 --> 01:28:39,630
Never, please. Thank you.

858
01:29:08,077 --> 01:29:10,871
<i>I sing to use the Waiting</i>

859
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:13,834
<i>My Bonnet but to tie</i>

860
01:29:15,085 --> 01:29:18,255
<i>And shut the Door unto my House</i>

861
01:29:18,338 --> 01:29:20,257
<i>No more to do have I</i>

862
01:29:21,758 --> 01:29:25,722
<i>Till His best step approaching</i>

863
01:29:25,805 --> 01:29:28,474
<i>We journey to the Day</i>

864
01:29:29,642 --> 01:29:32,979
<i>And tell each other how We sang</i>

865
01:29:33,062 --> 01:29:36,649
<i>To Keep the Dark away.</i>

866
01:30:16,151 --> 01:30:20,239
I'm bothered by the thought of you
hating your father.

867
01:30:22,532 --> 01:30:25,286
I don't like you carrying that around
with you.

868
01:30:28,706 --> 01:30:29,707
Also,

869
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:32,919
I don't quite feel
your father warrants it.

870
01:30:37,925 --> 01:30:41,595
This coming from the person
who wants to strangle him?

871
01:30:47,643 --> 01:30:50,230
Can I ask you a very dramatic question?

872
01:30:50,313 --> 01:30:51,690
Yes.

873
01:30:56,069 --> 01:30:58,613
Why did you have me in the first place?

874
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:01,450
Well, that is...

875
01:31:03,619 --> 01:31:04,745
dramatic.

876
01:31:09,542 --> 01:31:13,714
Well, it wasn't planned, of course.

877
01:31:14,256 --> 01:31:15,924
I thought I couldn't have children.

878
01:31:17,551 --> 01:31:19,219
I'd never wanted one.

879
01:31:20,929 --> 01:31:24,224
Then when it happened, we thought...

880
01:31:26,436 --> 01:31:29,939
your presence could help us come together.

881
01:31:30,023 --> 01:31:34,652
And, well, you were a last-ditch effort,
in effect.

882
01:31:36,821 --> 01:31:40,367
But then, when he saw you, it...

883
01:31:41,452 --> 01:31:44,079
I don't know, clarified something for him,

884
01:31:44,163 --> 01:31:47,917
and he turned away forever
from you and me. Both.

885
01:31:53,757 --> 01:31:56,259
But I shouldn't hate him?

886
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:08,981
Your father is an emotional moron,
but he isn't evil.

887
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:14,905
What happened when you saw me?

888
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:23,705
I've never been so hurt...

889
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:26,292
by something in my life

890
01:32:26,376 --> 01:32:29,504
as when I saw your face
for the first time.

891
01:32:33,299 --> 01:32:34,217
Why?

892
01:32:36,469 --> 01:32:38,597
Because you were your father.

893
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:45,187
Because you were me.

894
01:32:48,732 --> 01:32:51,861
Because you were all three of us.

895
01:32:53,863 --> 01:32:55,490
So ruinous.

896
01:33:01,622 --> 01:33:04,041
And why did you come to me when you did?

897
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:07,336
That was strange, wasn't it?

898
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:11,007
It was unexpected.
I wanted you to come, you know?

899
01:33:11,799 --> 01:33:15,846
But I wanted you to come for so long
that when you finally did, I was confused.

900
01:33:17,389 --> 01:33:18,557
I'm sorry.

901
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:20,392
I know.

902
01:33:21,268 --> 01:33:22,603
But don't be.

903
01:33:22,686 --> 01:33:24,856
I was happy. Really.

904
01:33:24,939 --> 01:33:26,774
- Were you?
- Yes.

905
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:29,485
I didn't know you were you.

906
01:33:30,236 --> 01:33:32,822
I'd have come right away if I had.

907
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:36,827
I'd never have let you go
in the first place.

908
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:45,127
You understand what it did for me.

909
01:33:48,297 --> 01:33:49,215
Yes.

910
01:33:50,634 --> 01:33:52,844
- I hope you do.
- I do.

911
01:34:30,593 --> 01:34:32,011
I love you, pal.

912
01:34:33,179 --> 01:34:34,597
I love you too.

913
01:35:01,669 --> 01:35:03,004
Good night.

914
01:35:04,171 --> 01:35:05,881
- Good night.
- Good night.

915
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:34,746
Madeleine.

916
01:35:36,874 --> 01:35:37,916
Madeleine.

917
01:35:49,929 --> 01:35:51,640
Were you sleeping?

918
01:35:51,723 --> 01:35:52,849
<i>No.</i>

919
01:35:52,933 --> 01:35:54,225
What are you doing?

920
01:35:56,144 --> 01:35:58,855
<i>Just sitting here under this bench.</i>

921
01:36:00,775 --> 01:36:05,613
Well, I was just thinking about you.
I thought I'd give you a ring.

922
01:36:06,697 --> 01:36:09,408
Don't you wanna know
what I was thinking about?

923
01:36:09,492 --> 01:36:12,036
- <i>All right.</i>
- There's three things, actually.

924
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:16,291
- Do you remember our first date?
- <i>I don't. No.</i>

925
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:19,086
Yes, you do. You took me
to Tavern on the Green.

926
01:36:19,169 --> 01:36:22,464
You ate your cupcake
with a fork and knife. No?

927
01:36:22,547 --> 01:36:24,591
- <i>No.</i>
- Why did you do that?

928
01:36:25,301 --> 01:36:27,053
The fork and knife, I mean.

929
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:32,016
<i>I don't know, Frances. Who knows?</i>

930
01:36:34,602 --> 01:36:37,106
The second thing is,

931
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:41,735
I'm feeling badly
about our last conversation.

932
01:36:44,488 --> 01:36:46,782
And I want you to know

933
01:36:46,865 --> 01:36:48,910
I don't hate you anymore.

934
01:36:50,912 --> 01:36:53,331
<i>It's late to be telling me this.</i>

935
01:36:53,415 --> 01:36:55,542
Late at night, or late in life?

936
01:36:56,167 --> 01:36:59,129
<i>Both, but mainly late in life.</i>

937
01:37:00,923 --> 01:37:04,093
I can't understand that as an attitude.

938
01:37:04,176 --> 01:37:07,221
Your wife of long years,

939
01:37:07,305 --> 01:37:11,434
who only days earlier
wanted to murder you...

940
01:37:12,143 --> 01:37:16,315
has had a sudden shift in feeling
for the good.

941
01:37:16,857 --> 01:37:18,567
Is that not noteworthy?

942
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:21,486
- <i>I guess so. But, Frances...</i>
- What?

943
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:23,989
- <i>I'm a cat.</i>
- I know that.

944
01:37:24,072 --> 01:37:25,491
<i>I'm a cat.</i>

945
01:37:25,575 --> 01:37:27,660
<i>And I've got worms and fleas.</i>

946
01:37:27,744 --> 01:37:30,538
<i>And, you know, I'm not much concerned
about anything</i>

947
01:37:30,622 --> 01:37:33,291
<i>besides the unhappy fact of my horrible,</i>

948
01:37:33,374 --> 01:37:36,712
<i>my truly horrible,
miserable fucking existence.</i>

949
01:37:36,795 --> 01:37:37,796
I see.

950
01:37:38,589 --> 01:37:39,840
Well...

951
01:37:41,467 --> 01:37:43,636
are you ready for the third thing?

952
01:37:44,345 --> 01:37:45,220
<i>Sure.</i>

953
01:37:47,431 --> 01:37:50,310
When I came to Paris the first time,

954
01:37:50,393 --> 01:37:52,145
do you remember what I told you about it?

955
01:37:52,228 --> 01:37:56,775
About how I felt startled to be here.

956
01:37:57,901 --> 01:37:59,736
<i>I remember you telling me.</i>

957
01:37:59,819 --> 01:38:01,989
Oh, you remember something.

958
01:38:02,073 --> 01:38:04,617
How nice that is for you and me.

959
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:08,204
Oh, it's nice for the both of us.
Hail, hail.

960
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:13,085
Well, I figured out
what I was startled by.

961
01:38:13,168 --> 01:38:14,461
<i>And what's that?</i>

962
01:38:15,879 --> 01:38:21,176
I recognized Paris
as the eventual location of my death.

963
01:38:23,136 --> 01:38:24,346
<i>What does that mean?</i>

964
01:38:25,181 --> 01:38:29,435
Something in the sight of this city...

965
01:38:30,895 --> 01:38:32,689
sent up an alert.

966
01:38:35,608 --> 01:38:38,612
It was the presentiment
of what was to come.

967
01:38:39,989 --> 01:38:41,198
Do you see?

968
01:38:42,574 --> 01:38:43,701
<i>Frances...</i>

969
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:51,334
Thank you.

970
01:38:53,253 --> 01:38:54,212
That's all.

971
01:39:56,404 --> 01:39:57,656
Excuse me.

972
01:40:01,535 --> 01:40:03,162
Are you all right, madame?

973
01:40:06,999 --> 01:40:08,334
Why wouldn't I be?

974
01:40:09,085 --> 01:40:11,295
Just that it's quite late to be out.

975
01:40:12,714 --> 01:40:13,882
You are.

976
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:16,134
That's true.

977
01:40:19,972 --> 01:40:21,848
I've lost my cat.

978
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:29,065
Yes.

979
01:40:29,983 --> 01:40:31,901
You've got the look of someone who has.

980
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,699
And that's why you are out
so late on your own?

981
01:40:38,617 --> 01:40:40,327
You want me to help you look?

982
01:40:41,453 --> 01:40:44,707
No. No, thank you.

983
01:41:34,469 --> 01:41:35,637
Frances?

984
01:41:52,822 --> 01:41:55,992
We'll fan out and meet back here
in an hour, right?

985
01:41:56,076 --> 01:41:57,535
- All right.
- All right.

986
01:42:02,792 --> 01:42:05,628
Susan, will you stay here
in case she comes back?

987
01:42:07,546 --> 01:42:09,674
Madeleine's bag isn't here.

988
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:12,803
Well, there you go.
Frances probably walked her to the train.

989
01:42:16,765 --> 01:42:18,684
Malcolm, put your coat on.

990
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:25,548
So how was it?

991
01:43:26,132 --> 01:43:27,342
How was what?

992
01:43:27,425 --> 01:43:31,220
Your educational experience.

993
01:43:31,304 --> 01:43:32,472
I don't know.

994
01:43:32,555 --> 01:43:35,350
Don't say "I don't know."
Of course you know. What was it like?

995
01:43:35,433 --> 01:43:37,061
Not really very much fun.

996
01:43:38,062 --> 01:43:40,064
Didn't you have any friends?

997
01:43:40,773 --> 01:43:42,149
Some.

998
01:43:42,232 --> 01:43:45,736
But you found the relationships
unfulfilling?

999
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:46,737
I don't...

1000
01:43:48,113 --> 01:43:49,449
I don't...

1001
01:43:50,450 --> 01:43:52,535
What was the food like?

1002
01:43:53,078 --> 01:43:54,663
The food was awful.

1003
01:43:56,665 --> 01:43:58,208
Your father's dead, pal.

1004
01:43:58,291 --> 01:43:59,167
I know.

1005
01:44:00,001 --> 01:44:01,504
How do you know?

1006
01:44:01,587 --> 01:44:02,797
Kids told me.

1007
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,423
They showed it to me in the paper.

1008
01:44:08,386 --> 01:44:10,054
What'd the paper say?

1009
01:44:10,137 --> 01:44:12,683
- That he died a while ago.
- About me.

1010
01:44:12,766 --> 01:44:15,769
I mean, what did it say about me?

1011
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:18,939
It's okay.

1012
01:44:20,357 --> 01:44:21,316
Go ahead.

1013
01:44:22,275 --> 01:44:23,819
It said you were arrested.

1014
01:44:24,612 --> 01:44:26,030
Why was I arrested?

1015
01:44:26,906 --> 01:44:29,033
It said you didn't do
what you were supposed to do.

1016
01:44:35,081 --> 01:44:36,208
Look...

1017
01:44:36,917 --> 01:44:40,087
what was done and not done
was done or not done for a very good...

1018
01:44:40,796 --> 01:44:41,964
very real reason.

1019
01:44:42,047 --> 01:44:44,008
- All right?
- All right.

1020
01:44:44,091 --> 01:44:47,344
And what you have to understand
is that I was not wrong.

1021
01:44:49,264 --> 01:44:50,890
If this is going to work...

1022
01:44:52,809 --> 01:44:54,144
You and me, I mean.

1023
01:44:54,227 --> 01:44:57,689
You're going to have to take my word
for that. All right?

1024
01:44:57,772 --> 01:44:58,815
Okay?

1025
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:03,446
Okay.

1026
01:45:06,741 --> 01:45:08,117
What was jail like?

1027
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:11,329
Not really very much fun.

1028
01:45:12,247 --> 01:45:13,623
What was the food like?

1029
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,086
You're getting it.

1030
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:22,174
Now, let's have that tie.

1031
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:24,177
- Why?
- Oh, it's...

1032
01:45:59,517 --> 01:46:04,517
