00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:17,163
What's your resolution?

3
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:18,363
I'm gonna cut carbs.

4
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:22,020
But, you're Mexican.
You can't eat nothin yo grandma makes.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,081
It only takes 30 days to form a habit.

6
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:26,268
And then, it becomes second nature.

7
00:00:26,468 --> 00:00:29,110
Who said that?
- ... Oprah.

8
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:36,532
What's yours?
- I'm gonna quit selling trees.

Every time you touch me,

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,178
all I can think about is how you was touchin that Bitch.

Hmm?

21
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:05,044
No, you got caught, one time.

And you gonna sit here and tell me,
that was the first time you kicked it with that Bitch.

23
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:16,104
You ain't never seen her before that huh?

24
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,738
That shit is over.

25
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,781
All I want is you...

00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:15,450
What's up?

33
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,650
I can't sleep...

34
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,438
<i>Can't sleep.</i>

35
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:26,183
You want to sleep in here with Mommy and Daddy?

81
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:50,544

Dude. I hired somebody else.

140
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,633
For me to bring you back,
that means I have to let someone else go.

141
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:21,823
Someone... Who's never showed up late,
once.

00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:16,170
Give me the bad news first.

171
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,934

172
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:21,134
How much?

173
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:25,198
Like $300. But, I can get you back
in a couple of weeks.

174
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:26,432
Okay. So, What's the good news.

175
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:29,696

203
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,290
Alright, turn around.

204
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,204

00:22:37,843 --> 00:22:38,973
Happy Birthday.

207
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:40,733
What happened to your face?

208
00:22:45,837 --> 00:22:47,270
You look nice today.

209
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:50,729
My girls come over last night?

210
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:52,890
We played board games.

211
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,090
I bet, Y'all let her win too.

212
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,290
Of course.

213
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,668
Yall hella weak for that.
She gets no easy wins with me around.

214
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,677
What?

215
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:04,130
Do you remember that microwave popcorn
you bought a while back?

216
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,330
Hella good.

217
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,497
Yeah. While I was putting it into a bowl.

218
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:11,635
Tatiana's just standing there..
Staring up at me;

219
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:13,884
Looking like she wants something.

220
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:17,417
Okay, what?
C'mon mom.

221
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:18,617
She says..

222
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:21,362
"Grandma, do we have any dark butter?"

223
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:24,083
What's Dark butter?

224
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,794
I'm thinking, maybe she watch
"Food Network" or something.

225
00:23:27,994 --> 00:23:30,646
So I say, "what's dark butter sweetheart?"

226
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:36,402
She says, "When Daddy took me to see WALL.E
he asked for light butter,

227
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:39,192
so I want to try some dark butter this time."

228
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:40,288
She too smart.

229
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:41,413
This moms right here?

230
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:45,843

233
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,230
Is there a problem here?

234
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,430

00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,759
Calm... down!

238
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,959
Oscar...

239
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,215
What happened to your face?

240
00:24:27,978 --> 00:24:29,458
Dark butter.

241
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,140
She always listening?
Too damn smart for her own good.

242
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,189
The preschool said we should think about
starting her in school early.

243
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:40,389
Phina tell you that?

244
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:44,408
Yeah, we're gonna put her in private school.

245
00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:48,825
Uniforms...

246
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:53,236
I was lookin at St. Bede the other day.
It's this other school that starts them off learning Spanish,

247
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:56,340
and they back going on English -
- I'm not coming to see you anymore.

248
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,540
What?

249
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,533
I'm not coming here, to these visits anymore.
This is the last time.

250
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:06,101
I know I know I know. This is my last time too.
I told you that.

251
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:08,835
I ain't goin down no more.
- You want to keep putting Sophina through this...

252
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,340
you go on right ahead. Okay?

253
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,623
But Tatiana,

254
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:14,800
that baby doesn't deserve this, Oscar.

255
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:16,938
She don't know what's going on.

256
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:21,894
So, I guess that's why she asked me
why you love taking your vacations more than being with her.

257
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:23,094
She aint say that.

258
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:25,342
Oh, So I'm the liar now.

259
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:30,944
Ma you gotta tell her that I love her.

260
00:25:32,963 --> 00:25:35,741
Tell her, I ain't gonna leave her.
- Tell her yourself!

261
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:37,608
The Next time you call home you tell her yourself.

262
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,628
Or better yet, let her come visit you here.

263
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:49,108
She don't need to be exposed.
- You've already exposed--!

264
00:25:49,963 --> 00:25:52,373
You've already exposed her to this.
- So, you gonna leave me?

265
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:54,804
You gonna leave me again, What kinda mom is you?

266
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:56,727
You wanna fuck around and leave me in here?

267
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,190
You ain't never have my fuckin' back anyway.

268
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:06,433
I'm being here by myself.

269
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:14,197
I love you Oscar..
I do.

270
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:16,629
And, I'm praying for you.

271
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:20,713
I'll see you when you get home.

272
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:24,403
Ma, hold up. Let me get a hug, Ma.

273
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:27,018
- Grant.
- I can't get a hug?

274
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:33,369
Ma, let me get a hug..Ma!

275
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:34,569

00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:49,013
Sold it to a white boy.
- For real..For how much?

282
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:53,840
Gave me a rack for it.
- I was'nt gonna pay that high.

283
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,035
But, I still needed that though...

Carrot cake.

293
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,463
Why you didn't get ice cream?

294
00:29:21,963 --> 00:29:25,303
Cause it aint your birthday.

295
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:29,425
You know it would be hella easier
if you just had your stuff at my spot right.

296
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,573
When you gonna move in.

297
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:35,433
Maybe, when you stop having trees
in the car before we pick up T.

298
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:48,502
Can you roll down the window, please?

299
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:35,172
Hey T. T, come here.

We played "Freeze Tag" today.

301
00:30:47,824 --> 00:30:50,722
Did you win?
- They couldn't catch me.

302
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:51,953
You think you're fast huh?

303
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:55,753
Faster than daddy?

304

308
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:08,968
Ask your sister.
- But Rose got hella kids to watch.

309
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:13,455
But what's the difference between watching
six kids or watching seven kids?

310
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:26,076
<i>Quieres pasar la noche con sus primos?
- Si, si.</i>

311
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:34,003
Daddy, what's that on your shirt?

312
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,931
Daddy had an accident at work.

313
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:42,801
How's work? By the way.

314
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,858
Work is... work.

315

318
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:24,118
There a shirt on the bed for you, if you want.

319
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,332

I lost my job.

323
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:03,673
For what?

324
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,656
Being late.

325
00:34:08,383 --> 00:34:10,327
Missed a couple days when I had to get some money.

326
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:13,122
They told you today?

327
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:14,322
On your day off?

328
00:34:15,243 --> 00:34:17,723
Keep it real, they told me two weeks ago.

329
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:23,089
My bad Phina -

330
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,483
I though I was gonna get my job back.

331
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:30,333
I thought I could talk to Emi...
- You think life a fucking joke...

332
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:34,466
You think you're gonna get fired and then
somebody is gona give you thier job back?

333
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:40,287
What?

334
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,782
You aint shit, you know that?

335
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,305
You lie to me, you lie to your fucking daughter.

336
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,639
I didn't have to tell you nothing!

337
00:34:51,653 --> 00:34:53,749
I coulda kept gettin' it.
I don't wanna know shit.

338
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:55,149
So you would have just kept faking..

00:34:55,903 --> 00:35:01,656
You been out bustin nocks? And doing whatever else,
or WHOEVER else you do while I'm at work?

340
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,441
You ain't even listening to me.

341
00:35:05,641 --> 00:35:10,244
Not after you lie for two weeks get cornered,
and don't have a choice.

342
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,444
That's some pussy act shit.

343
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:15,879
What did you today. Hmm.

344
00:35:18,218 --> 00:35:21,330
I bet you sold that fucking zip.
- I dumped that shit, Phina.

345
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:22,983
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

346
00:35:26,163 --> 00:35:27,403
I'm tired.

347
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:34,159
Thought I could start fresh.
But that shit aint working like that.

348
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:50,160
You threw a whole zip of weed.
And you don't got a job.

349
00:35:55,955 --> 00:35:57,979
I could slap you right now.

350
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:07,259
What are you gonna do?

351
00:36:10,354 --> 00:36:11,809
Something legal.

352
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:17,248
Maybe if I can just not fuck up, for 30 days..

353
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:24,992
That's how long Oprah said to form a habit, right?

354
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,697
Look at me.

355
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:37,817
Don't make me have to do this shit alone, again.

356
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,196
You guys are just in time.

357
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:41,873
Oh my god, you guys got a cake too?

359
00:38:03,168 --> 00:38:05,784
Baby, You know all I needed was two,
you didn't have to spend so much money.

360
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,051
You ain' gotta worry about that.

361
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:28,269
A Raiders fan, cheering for the Steelers.

362
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:30,882
Yes, A Raiders fan, cheering for the Steelers.

365
00:39:34,564 --> 00:39:38,868
Coach even has a black wife.
I'm going with the Steelers.

366
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:41,900
You're insane, you know that?

367
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:09,292
Thanks for your help tonight.

368
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,062
Oh, Come'on Ma, You ain't gotta thank me.

369
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,396
You shouldn't even be doing this.

370
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:16,596
Relax.

371
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,717

00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:44,273
Catch the fireworks
Probably roll around a bit after that.

379
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:45,473
Roll around?

380
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:49,371

Plus, Sophina's got work in the morning anyway.

382
00:41:55,392 --> 00:41:56,656
You guys gonna be drinking?

383
00:41:56,856 --> 00:42:00,029
Mom, there ain't gonna be drinking.

384
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:01,229
Phss..I can't even remember.

385
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:06,923
Why don't you take the train out there?

386
00:42:07,453 --> 00:42:12,514
That way you guys can drink and hang out,
and not have to worry about anything.

387
00:42:17,176 --> 00:42:18,521
No traffic either.

You know its gonna be crazy.
Going and coming back.

389

00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:30,000
Don't make me follow you guys to make sure.

No you don't. Because then-
THE GUMBO MONSTER WILL GET YOU!!!!!

413
00:45:43,902 --> 00:45:45,677
You had gumbo, too.

Me and mom are gonna take off, okay?

415

Scared of what?

00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:55,793
You know what, baby?

423
00:46:55,993 --> 00:46:58,596
Those are just firecrakers.

424
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:01,413
You'll be safe inside, with your cousin.

Hey, listen.
None of that.

641
01:10:55,695 --> 01:10:56,695
None of that.

642
01:10:56,895 --> 01:10:58,713
It's not the time or the place.

643
01:11:10,303 --> 01:11:11,803
Hey, we gotta keep him positive.

644
01:11:13,413 --> 01:11:16,252
We gotta.we gotta let these
people do their job.

645
01:11:16,452 --> 01:11:17,452
He's gonna be fine.

646
01:11:17,652 --> 01:11:20,562
Let's put all our energy toward Oscar right now.

647
01:11:20,762 --> 01:11:21,762
I know y'all are upset.

648
01:11:21,962 --> 01:11:25,715
We gotta lift him up.
Let's keep him lifted up.

649
01:11:27,248 --> 01:11:28,776
Let's keep him lifted up.

650
01:11:40,599 --> 01:11:41,585
Mrs.Johnson?
- Yes.

651
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:44,731
How is he?
How is he?

652
01:11:44,931 --> 01:11:47,237
Mrs.Johnson, as you know..

653
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:48,437
Your son has been shot.

654
01:11:48,753 --> 01:11:50,567
We've stabilized him,

655
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:51,767
but he's critical.

656
01:11:54,065 --> 01:11:55,161
Critical. What is that?

657
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:58,999
Well, he has massive internal bleeding
and we had to remove the right lung.

658
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:03,664
His lung? How is he...
How is he going to be able to breathe?

659
01:12:04,103 --> 01:12:06,558
He's on a breathing machine, right now.

660
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:07,758
His breathing is stable.

661
01:12:09,151 --> 01:12:11,343
The main problem is the internal bleeding.

662
01:12:12,563 --> 01:12:15,978
We've had some difficulty stopping the bleeding..

663
01:12:16,178 --> 01:12:17,279
That's getting his blood to clot.

664
01:12:17,953 --> 01:12:21,050
He hasn't fully responded to the transfusions, yet.

665
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,953
But he's going to make it right?

666
01:12:23,153 --> 01:12:24,153
But he's going to make it.

667
01:12:24,353 --> 01:12:26,581
I promise you, we're gonna do everything we can okay?

668
01:12:33,513 --> 01:12:36,522
Please do whatever you can, please.

669
01:12:44,343 --> 01:12:45,506
We gotta lift him up, you all.

670
01:12:45,706 --> 01:12:48,123
We gotta lift Oscar up.

671
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:32,495
You all, let's pray.

672
01:13:42,103 --> 01:13:43,343
<i>Heavenly father...</i>

673
01:13:43,543 --> 01:13:47,922
<i>We kneel before you..
And ask you..</i>

674
01:13:48,122 --> 01:13:51,220
<i>To put your healing hands around your child.</i>

675
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,458
<i>We ask you dear Lord...</i>

676
01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:57,263
<i>to operate through these doctors;</i>

677
01:14:00,154 --> 01:14:04,113
<i>Breathe strength into their hands Lord,
as they work on him.</i>

678
01:14:06,251 --> 01:14:08,795
<i>We are asking you right now, to heal him.</i>

679
01:14:10,563 --> 01:14:15,929
<i>Oh, Heal him lord,
so we can hold him and see his smile again.</i>

680
01:14:16,129 --> 01:14:20,106
<i>In your name, we pray. Amen.</i>

681
01:15:12,024 --> 01:15:13,185
He didn't make it.

682
01:15:19,997 --> 01:15:22,022
I need to see him.

683
01:15:24,081 --> 01:15:25,375
Okay, you can see him.

684
01:15:25,575 --> 01:15:28,264
But they don't want you go into the room and detach him.

685
01:15:28,464 --> 01:15:30,476
Cos they ruled it a homicide.

686
01:15:30,676 --> 01:15:33,011
I need to see him.

687
01:15:35,024 --> 01:15:37,024
I need to see him.

688
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:38,224
I can take her.
- Okay.

689
01:16:21,204 --> 01:16:23,116
I told him to catch the train.

690
01:16:24,755 --> 01:16:27,354
I told him to catch BART!

691
01:16:27,554 --> 01:16:30,449
I didn't know they were gonna hurt him.

692
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,665
I should have just let him drive.

693
01:16:34,865 --> 01:16:38,245
I should have let him drive.
I wanted him to be safe.

694
01:16:44,026 --> 01:16:45,544
You gotta let me hug him.

695
01:16:45,744 --> 01:16:48,697
Please, let me hug him.
Please.

696
01:16:50,379 --> 01:16:52,970
He didn't like to be alone!!

697
01:17:12,173 --> 01:17:13,619
Come on, T.

698
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,772
Where's Daddy?

699
01:17:38,305 --> 01:18:38,301
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
