3
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:30,738
Hello, sir.

4
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:32,807
Hello, I'm with Estelle.

5
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:34,909
Ah. She's right this way.

6
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:43,951
Estelle?

7
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:47,922
I'm Brian.

8
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:50,224
Don't tell me I'm late.
I am never late.

9
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,560
No, no. I'm early.

10
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:55,029
Oh, I see. Yes.

11
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:57,599
Well, I'll tell you the truth,

12
00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:00,268
I walked around the place
a couple of times.

13
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,770
Butterflies in my tummy.

14
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:04,705
Ah. Vodka martini.

15
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:16,250
Oh!

16
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:17,685
Not driving then?

17
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:19,020
No, no.

18
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:21,456
My grandson's picking me up.
Stephen.

19
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:22,658
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.

20
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,759
Is he your only grandchild?

21
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,728
Yes. The only one.

22
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:31,699
He's all I've got left.

23
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:34,936
You've got a son, I remember.

24
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:38,473
Yes. Robert.
He lives in Australia.

25
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,510
My Harriet has been gone
for three years now,

26
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:43,978
and your husband, Alasdair...

27
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:45,313
Alasdair. That's right.

28
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,714
Yes, a year.

29
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,822
So, tell me,
have you done this a lot?

30
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,925
Met people
on the computer service?

31
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:01,162
Yes. I have.

32
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:04,333
Don't you find
it's always the same?

33
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,202
You mean the anticipation
followed by the letdown?

34
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:11,105
Though we never say it,
of course.

35
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:13,207
"If you'd only
described yourself,

36
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:16,210
shall we say,
more accurately,

37
00:05:16,277 --> 00:05:19,013
we could have avoided wasting
all this time and energy,

38
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,116
which, at our stage in life,
we cannot afford to do."

39
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:24,752
I believe it's the system
for mismatching

40
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:27,321
the delusional
with the hopeless.

41
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,490
But I tell myself,

42
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:30,091
"Brace up. Be positive.

43
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:31,892
This time
it will be different."

44
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,696
You know, so do I.
I am the eternal optimist.

45
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:37,432
I thought as much.

46
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:42,036
Which is why
I must now confess to you

47
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:46,040
a deception on my part.

48
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:49,877
What I deplore most in life
is dishonesty.

49
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:52,780
My name is, in fact,
not Brian.

50
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:55,316
It's Roy.

51
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:56,984
Roy Courtnay.

52
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:59,521
Oh, I see.

53
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:03,057
Well, I suppose now's the time

54
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:07,061
that I tell you that my name
actually isn't Estelle.

55
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:08,697
Well, only if it isn't.

56
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:10,998
It's not.

57
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,234
It's Betty.

58
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:15,771
Betty McLeish.

59
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:17,071
Betty.

60
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:19,206
Oh, I think
I can handle that.

61
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:22,143
Hello, Betty.

62
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,057
Is that your grandson?

63
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:37,693
Yeah. He's been waiting.

64
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,293
Can we give you
a lift home?

65
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:40,429
What? Oh, no, no.

66
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:42,196
It's just a nip across
to the station,

67
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:44,499
a quick walk from Paddington,
and Bob's your uncle.

68
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:46,468
So, <i>au revoir,</i> Betty.

69
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,002
Until next time, Roy.

70
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,582
Will you call?

71
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:24,905
Go to Stringfellows, please.

72
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,753
Thank you, sir.

73
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,354
Follow me, please.

74
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:56,738
I'm sorry to hold you up.

75
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:59,039
Unavoidably detained.

76
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:02,309
How old was she?

77
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:05,146
Old enough.

78
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:07,716
Now we'll have champagne
all around.

79
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:09,316
Thank you.

80
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:11,252
I was just explaining
the rules.

81
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:14,523
As a precaution, no names.

82
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:17,559
The two of us have made a good
deal of money in the past,

83
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:20,127
which is why I thought
to give you the opportunity

84
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:23,097
to buy into
this new investment group.

85
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:25,199
Yes. I have made,
quite recently,

86
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:27,669
the acquaintance
of certain gentlemen,

87
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:31,373
who have £800,000
to invest.

88
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,209
They know me as a banker,
slightly bent,

89
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:37,077
who has guaranteed them

90
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:38,480
a quick doubling
of their money

91
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:42,484
if they invest it
in the limited partnership.

92
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:43,618
Which would be us.

93
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,953
But before they put
their money in,

94
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,956
they want to see us
put some money in.

95
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,792
Only 200,000.

96
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,993
50,000 from each of us.

97
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,697
No one here is uncomfortable
with that figure?

98
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:59,568
Good.

99
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:00,635
Well, now...

100
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:02,337
Got a question for you.

101
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:04,673
Not that I expect
a straight answer.

102
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:08,309
This proposition,
just how dodgy is it?

103
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,146
Well, it's rather difficult
to say.

104
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:14,081
See, I rest my case.

105
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:15,650
Another question,

106
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:17,719
which I doubt you'll answer
any more than the first.

107
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:19,286
Who are they?

108
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:21,322
Well, like all of us
at this table,

109
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,925
these men prefer anonymity.

110
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:26,495
And to your point, um...

111
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,530
Bryn.

112
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:31,433
Oh, dear.
The first to break a rule.

113
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:36,203
But to your point, Bryn,

114
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,707
I can say
they are foreign nationals,

115
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:43,445
who desire to become a part
of the English investor class.

116
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:44,779
Russians.

117
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:45,914
Got it in one.

118
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:48,617
Cossacks.
I fucking hate Cossacks.

119
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:54,321
Well, if you can't
join us, Bryn,

120
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:56,190
I suggest that
you remove yourself

121
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,527
from any further discussion.

122
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:03,130
I didn't say that,
did I? Mmm?

123
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,165
Good.

124
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:06,902
Because the money you put in,

125
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:10,237
you'll get back
four times over at the payout.

126
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:14,709
Ah, thank you, dear.

127
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:17,111
Excuse me.

128
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:21,248
You called.

129
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,316
Thank you.

130
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:23,585
Thanks, love.

131
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,133
Well, I may have
missed a step,

132
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,135
but I am fairly certain
that Adolf Hitler

133
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:42,704
was not machine-gunned
to death

134
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:44,271
in a French cinema.

135
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,774
Well, it would have been
rather good if he had been.

136
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,942
Yeah, but young people,

137
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:48,476
they go and see a film
like that

138
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:50,445
and they think that
that's what actually happened.

139
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:52,514
Oh, no, no.
I taught for 40 years

140
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:54,616
and this generation
are far less likely

141
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,083
to believe everything
they're told

142
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,619
than we were.

143
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:58,753
Oh, God!

144
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:01,288
Roy, what is it?

145
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:02,824
No, no. It's my knee.

146
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:06,260
It gives way
sometimes and then...

147
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:08,295
No, it will be fine
in a minute.

148
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,799
Here. Here.
I've got you. I've got you.

149
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,099
- Thanks.
- All right.

150
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:15,036
All right now?

151
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,504
Yeah.

152
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:38,827
A titch down on the right.

153
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:40,562
That's it.

154
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,366
Thank you.

155
00:11:44,432 --> 00:11:47,335
Now, the purpose
of this joint investment

156
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:49,571
is the purchase
of this property

157
00:11:49,638 --> 00:11:50,605
in the Caribbean.

158
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:52,507
Once the purchase
goes through,

159
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:54,141
the property will be resold

160
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,946
by prior arrangement
at twice the price.

161
00:11:58,013 --> 00:11:59,381
When do we get profit?

162
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:01,416
In one week's time.

163
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:08,089
All transactions
are done electronically

164
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:09,824
via these keypads.

165
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:12,994
I will now transfer...

166
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,462
...our £200,000...

167
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:19,467
...into the joint
investment account.

168
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:24,973
And all you do now
is transfer your funds

169
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,942
in the amount of £800,000

170
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,745
and, oh, we're tickety-boo.

171
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:33,313
You put in 200,000.

172
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:35,784
We put in 800,000.

173
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,152
Right.

174
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:38,620
Your investment
is the greater,

175
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:41,856
but then so is your profit.

176
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:48,195
Well, if there are
no more questions...

177
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:49,464
Yeah, I've got a question.

178
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,500
See, all this money
you're gonna make,

179
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,436
what's Putin's cut?

180
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:14,589
What the fuck was that?

181
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:16,057
I'll see you out.

182
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:17,759
They were not amused by you.

183
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:19,327
How'd you know?
You don't speak Russian.

184
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:20,595
Don't have to.

185
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:24,766
Well, how do we get them back?

186
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,701
We'll have to regain
their trust,

187
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:28,002
won't we, Bryn?

188
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:30,638
Yeah.

189
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:31,806
Bryn.

190
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:43,551
Heigh-ho!

191
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:46,855
Oh.

192
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:49,724
Has your knee gone again?

193
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,994
Well, it's been like this
for a few days now.

194
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:54,329
Why didn't you take a cab?

195
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:56,231
Oh, I made it here, didn't I?

196
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:58,265
Yes, and you've probably
made it worse.

197
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,001
Anyway, it's bloody closed.

198
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,670
Oh, and I didn't call
to bloody check.

199
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:05,573
I have made a hash of things,
haven't I?

200
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,781
Watch this.

201
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,317
Well, this is unexpected.

202
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:18,419
I bought it today.

203
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:19,888
Did he give you good terms?

204
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:21,089
You know, these dealers,

205
00:14:21,156 --> 00:14:22,457
they like to take advantage
of our sorts.

206
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:23,792
Oh, no, I paid cash.

207
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,927
You stay here,
I'm gonna pick you up.

208
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,532
You paid cash?

209
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:38,373
What I love most
is how quiet it is.

210
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,875
Mmm.

211
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,410
Took some
getting used to,

212
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:44,078
but now I really enjoy it.

213
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:54,856
Wait. Wait, Roy.
I'll get you.

214
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,323
Just a sec.

215
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,694
- Okay.
- You're all right?

216
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:02,163
Oh, dear.

217
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,431
Yes.

218
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:05,233
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
There.

219
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,002
- Don't you...
- No steps. Oh, well done.

220
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:09,137
- Okay.
- You're okay?

221
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:10,572
Yes, yes.

222
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:20,081
Very up-to-the-minute,
isn't it?

223
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,683
Thought I'd start afresh.

224
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:22,750
Yeah.

225
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:32,328
Jesus.

226
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:38,600
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, Betty.

227
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,468
This has been a feast.

228
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:41,836
Just leftovers.

229
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:44,439
Yes. No, but it's what
you did with them.

230
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:45,940
Betty, are you back?

231
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:48,009
We're here!

232
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:51,913
Ah. Stephen. The grandson.

233
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:54,649
Roy Courtnay.

234
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:58,119
I thought
you were out tonight.

235
00:15:58,186 --> 00:15:59,621
No, no. We're in.

236
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:00,989
Roy's knee went out on him.

237
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:03,091
Oh, really? Should we call
for an ambulance?

238
00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:04,326
Oh, no.

239
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:06,060
It's nothing
as dramatic as that.

240
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:08,796
Does Stephen live here
with you?

241
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:10,899
No, no. He's doing his
doctorate at Royal Holloway.

242
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:12,901
He just sleeps over
on occasion.

243
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,836
- Ah.
- Can I give you a lift?

244
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:15,803
To?

245
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,540
To wherever it is
that you live.

246
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:22,543
Stephen, we haven't
finished dinner yet.

247
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,047
Oh. I suppose I should be
getting along, yeah.

248
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:29,117
Then I insist that
Stephen drive you home.

249
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:32,720
I think I'll come along
for the ride.

250
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:39,427
Many, many thanks.
Here we go.

251
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:40,495
Good night.

252
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,432
What floor do you live on?

253
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:45,867
On the top floor.

254
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:48,069
You can't go up and down
all those stairs.

255
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:49,971
What would you have me do?

256
00:16:50,038 --> 00:16:51,773
Sell up and move?

257
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,841
No, for God's sake.
Come and stay with me.

258
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:55,243
- What?
- I've got a spare room.

259
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,611
What are you doing?

260
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:58,146
I mean, just till
you get back on your feet.

261
00:16:58,212 --> 00:17:01,783
Betty, you are as generous
as you're beautiful.

262
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:02,951
But no.

263
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:10,925
Whoops.
There we go.

264
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:27,909
This is ridiculous!

265
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:32,080
I'm afraid I haven't
got around to this room yet.

266
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:35,116
So, it's a bit bare.

267
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:38,219
But you can use
all the drawers

268
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,788
and, of course, there's the
wardrobe, that's empty.

269
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:42,590
Yeah.

270
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:44,792
So, I'll get you some towels.

271
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:46,494
Make yourself comfy.

272
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:51,165
Fat chance of that.

273
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:57,105
That's very kind.

274
00:18:03,412 --> 00:18:04,912
Keep up.

275
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:07,215
Plenty of time
for rest afterwards.

276
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:10,352
All there?

277
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,719
Ready?

278
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:13,721
Two more kilometers.

279
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:18,993
No dilly-dallying.

280
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,296
Well, I don't speak
to him either, I just...

281
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:26,368
Yes, she's so big,
I can't believe it.

282
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:28,370
Come on, ladies.

283
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:32,540
Here we are.

284
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:51,360
Inviting him
to move in,

285
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:52,660
what were you thinking?

286
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:54,496
Oh, please,
what's the harm?

287
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:55,663
When's the wedding? Huh?

288
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,098
Saturday week?

289
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:01,936
No, it's too soon
to be getting so close to him.

290
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:03,805
I would have thought
that was the whole point.

291
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:05,206
Yes, of course
it is the whole point,

292
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:08,343
but I didn't think
it would get this intimate.

293
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,777
Are you talking about me?

294
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,980
Albert Speer.

295
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:14,749
He's my dissertation subject.

296
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:16,050
- I was saying...
- Ah.

297
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:17,386
...the closer one gets,

298
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:19,654
the more
one loses perspective.

299
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,223
You've lost perspective
on Albert Speer?

300
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,291
Mm-hm.

301
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:24,692
I'm trying to determine

302
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,828
whether he was the innocent
he claimed to be.

303
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:28,863
Oh, I thought
that had been sorted out

304
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,665
when you were in nappies.

305
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:32,934
I think these sorts
of questions

306
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,937
are rarely completely
sorted out, are they?

307
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:38,706
Was it history
that you taught in school?

308
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:39,974
School?

309
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:43,778
No, Roy,
Betty taught at Oxford.

310
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:51,219
You hide your light
under a bushel, don't you?

311
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,628
There he goes,

312
00:20:00,695 --> 00:20:04,065
trailing his cliches
behind him.

313
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:06,100
I think he's quite charming.

314
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:08,604
You did not just say that.

315
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:11,739
Do I detect
a touch of jealousy?

316
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:26,954
Hello.

317
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:29,790
Betty says
wherever you need to go,

318
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,058
I'm to take you.

319
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,162
Where to?

320
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:37,566
Departure lounge
on the River Styx.

321
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:40,868
An old friend's got pancreatic cancer.
Said I'd drop by.

322
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:44,473
Nice. Can I take your bag?

323
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,940
Thank you, Stephen.

324
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:49,043
- It is very kind.
- You're welcome.

325
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:55,016
- Thank you.
- Mind your fingers.

326
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:09,964
Would you like to come
and see him?

327
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,700
Uh, no. I wouldn't want
to intrude.

328
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:42,763
Shall we resume?

329
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,834
Uh, I've got something to say.

330
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:52,407
I'd like to thank everyone
for making the effort

331
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:56,244
to convene us again today
after our first meeting.

332
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,213
We got off on the wrong foot.

333
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,619
Well, I know I did.
Unintentionally.

334
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:08,457
As a gesture of this,
and to decrease your risk,

335
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:14,529
we have increased our stake
to 100,000 each.

336
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:17,633
Doubling it to £400,000.

337
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,166
Well said, Bryn.

338
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:46,160
Well.

339
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:49,897
Let's crack the vodka!

340
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:54,469
All right.

341
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:55,771
Bryn!

342
00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:56,738
The second time's
a charm.

343
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:57,673
Good day's work.

344
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:59,508
I'm pleased.

345
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:09,116
He's wearing a fucking wire!

346
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:12,053
Police.

347
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:14,889
Police!

348
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:16,157
Fuck!

349
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:21,797
Police!

350
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:22,764
- Freeze!
- You! Freeze!

351
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,831
Get back!

352
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:24,965
No, no, no!

353
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:26,435
That way!
Use the back stairs!

354
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:28,002
Use the back stairs! Stairs!

355
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:29,870
You're under arrest!
Don't move!

356
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:31,072
Stop!

357
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:32,239
Freeze right where
you are!

358
00:23:32,873 --> 00:23:34,075
Stop!

359
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,455
Stop! Stop! Stop!

360
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:49,691
Stop! Stop!

361
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:52,226
English investor class.

362
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:01,370
Vlad.

363
00:24:01,436 --> 00:24:03,705
Thank you.
Well done. Well done.

364
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:07,342
Tickety-boo!

365
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:19,388
And? Was he glad to see you?

366
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:23,324
Poor sod didn't even know
I was there.

367
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:34,301
Really? Another bottle?

368
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:36,904
Your grandmother's
throwing caution to the wind.

369
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:37,972
Fine.

370
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:39,508
No, thank you.

371
00:24:39,574 --> 00:24:41,208
Oh, don't be such a prig!

372
00:24:41,275 --> 00:24:43,043
This is your
going-away dinner.

373
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,979
Yes!

374
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:47,849
Where is it
that you're off to?

375
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:49,116
Uh, some...

376
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:50,251
Spandau Prison.

377
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:52,387
Is it for a long stretch?

378
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:55,690
That's funny.

379
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:57,492
Spandau was where
Albert Speer

380
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:00,027
and the rest of the Nazi war
criminals were imprisoned.

381
00:25:00,094 --> 00:25:02,196
Return to the scene
of the crime?

382
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:04,900
Stephen believes
in the power of place.

383
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:06,167
It's mostly rubble now.

384
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:08,370
But the past becomes
more tangible

385
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:09,704
when one experiences
the environments

386
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:10,906
in which they occurred.

387
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:13,542
I never was one for history.

388
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:17,244
I mean, what is the point
in looking back?

389
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:22,884
What's done is done,
and you won't undo it.

390
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,353
You may begin
to understand it, though.

391
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,421
Ah.

392
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,862
Seems like you've had
quite a past, Roy?

393
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:35,430
Oh, my!

394
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:37,532
Enough to last
several lifetimes.

395
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,267
Were you in any branch
of the services?

396
00:25:42,002 --> 00:25:43,204
The armed services?

397
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,306
Yeah. The ones
with guns, yeah.

398
00:25:45,373 --> 00:25:49,444
I did serve in the army,
as it happens.

399
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:52,914
The war.

400
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,749
Is that how you got the scar?

401
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:02,357
On your neck, there.

402
00:26:07,995 --> 00:26:12,266
I told your grandmother
when we met,

403
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:16,303
what I deplored most
in this life was a lie.

404
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:19,474
So instead of making up
some story,

405
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:22,042
I'm going to say that
I prefer not to discuss

406
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:26,681
the circumstances
under which I was wounded.

407
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:30,184
I withdraw the question.

408
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:40,127
I did it shaving.

409
00:26:40,662 --> 00:26:41,963
Ah.

410
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:53,642
Yes, yes. Very good.
Very good.

411
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:57,111
Bye! Good luck!

412
00:26:58,413 --> 00:27:00,015
Well, that was lovely,
wasn't it?

413
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,181
Did you enjoy that?

414
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,817
That's twice now.

415
00:27:02,884 --> 00:27:04,151
Twice what?

416
00:27:04,218 --> 00:27:07,087
Twice that car's come
sneaking around.

417
00:27:07,154 --> 00:27:08,723
Are you sure
it's the same car?

418
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,028
Yes. Silver Audi
with a scratch on both sides.

419
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:14,829
Well, I don't know who it is.

420
00:27:30,077 --> 00:27:31,846
Tickety-boo?

421
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:34,015
Tickety-fucking-boo.

422
00:27:36,484 --> 00:27:38,787
<i>Oh, it's good to be back
in the city.</i>

423
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:42,256
<i>I don't know how much more
I can take of that place.</i>

424
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:45,527
<i>It's like being smothered
in beige.</i>

425
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:50,365
Any grumblings
from our investment group?

426
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:53,868
As far as they know,
you and I are in custody.

427
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:55,302
Their funds are frozen solid,

428
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,771
and the police
are on the lookout for them.

429
00:27:57,739 --> 00:27:59,608
Lose a 100 grand apiece.

430
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:03,044
They've got no one to blame
but themselves.

431
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,013
Call it a lesson learned.

432
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,648
Well, it is that.

433
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:11,218
Should we take care
of our problem?

434
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,851
Vlad?

435
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,590
Vinnie here says that you're
displeased with your fee.

436
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:51,893
I don't want a fee.
I want a cut.

437
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,828
A share in the profits?

438
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:55,229
Well, same as you.

439
00:28:55,295 --> 00:28:56,831
Same as Vinnie.

440
00:28:56,898 --> 00:28:59,134
I value the verisimilitude

441
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:02,103
that you bring to the party,
but I...

442
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:03,772
Don't fuck with me, Roy.

443
00:29:03,838 --> 00:29:06,007
The store is closed.
Please move on.

444
00:29:06,074 --> 00:29:07,809
I know things about you.

445
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:10,378
Who you really are.

446
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:18,153
I make allowances
for poor manners.

447
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:20,355
I tell myself,
cultural differences.

448
00:29:22,424 --> 00:29:24,392
Do you know what you'd get

449
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:27,495
back in Shittingrad
for what you said just now?

450
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:33,401
Your head in a bag
with your balls in your mouth.

451
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:38,740
I, by contrast,
prefer an appeal to reason.

452
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:43,044
No!

453
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:52,387
Since when do you do
the shopping?

454
00:29:52,454 --> 00:29:55,523
I'm exploring
the joys of domesticity.

455
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:07,368
To new pastures.

456
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:09,170
How much do you think
she's worth?

457
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:11,706
Half a million at least.

458
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:13,942
The only challenge
is the grandson.

459
00:30:14,008 --> 00:30:17,011
The little shit's off
on a wank for a few days,

460
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:19,013
so this is an ideal window.

461
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm back!

462
00:30:20,348 --> 00:30:22,951
Here in the kitchen!

463
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,529
Ah, Betty.

464
00:30:34,596 --> 00:30:36,263
- I hope you don't mind...
- Oh!

465
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:38,399
...but I've invited
a friend over.

466
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:41,301
Vincent Halloran.

467
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:42,403
Betty McLeish.

468
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,972
- Hello.
- Hello.

469
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:45,173
Vincent is my...

470
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,908
What is it
you call yourself?

471
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:49,844
The investment advisor.
It means glorified accountant.

472
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:51,980
I'm just helping Roy
get sorted.

473
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:53,448
You know, it's my will.

474
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,450
It's not a fortune,

475
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:58,720
but I've saved all my life,
and I am thrifty.

476
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:00,522
As anyone who's ever been
to a restaurant

477
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:02,590
with Roy can attest.

478
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:03,958
It all sounds
very complicated.

479
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:05,026
I'll leave you to it.

480
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:06,361
It's very simple, really.

481
00:31:06,427 --> 00:31:09,130
The goal is just
to minimize exposure.

482
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:10,565
Taxes and such.

483
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:12,033
Truth be told,

484
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,336
I was hoping you'd let me
leave something to you.

485
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:20,408
What? Roy!

486
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:22,677
What are you talking about?

487
00:31:22,744 --> 00:31:24,679
How long have we known
each other?

488
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:27,482
No! You've got your son
to think about.

489
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:30,285
Robert? Oh, no.

490
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:32,487
He's not in my will.

491
00:31:32,554 --> 00:31:34,689
I don't approve
of his lifestyle.

492
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:39,227
He designs kitchens.

493
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:43,698
Granted my little pot probably won't
make a ripple in what you've got.

494
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:45,433
People don't like to talk
about money.

495
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,303
It's a taboo subject,
but it's so important.

496
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:50,505
True. Like sex.

497
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,108
Or going to the lavatory.

498
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,010
Critically important,

499
00:31:56,077 --> 00:31:58,546
but not a subject
for polite conversation.

500
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:01,482
Yes, well, it isn't.

501
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:04,953
Well, what I think
Vincent means is

502
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:08,323
that we have to look after
what we worked to secure.

503
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:13,995
That's right! One's interest,
one's assets, family.

504
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:16,931
Might I ask what
the strategy has been

505
00:32:16,998 --> 00:32:18,166
vis-a-vis your estate?

506
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,835
I don't think you could
call it a strategy.

507
00:32:20,902 --> 00:32:22,036
Uh...

508
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:23,538
I've got my savings,

509
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:26,541
and then I've got the fund
that Alasdair set up.

510
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:28,042
And, of course,
I own this house

511
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:30,812
because I paid cash for it.

512
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:36,951
So, if we include the savings,
the fund, and the house,

513
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:39,787
your total assets
might come to...

514
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:45,793
It's about 2,700,000.
Something like that.

515
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,863
Maybe 800, I think,
the last time I looked.

516
00:32:49,797 --> 00:32:51,833
May I call you Betty?

517
00:32:53,268 --> 00:32:54,636
Well, over a 5-year period,

518
00:32:54,702 --> 00:32:56,771
I will project
an annual return

519
00:32:56,838 --> 00:32:58,840
of 15 to 20%

520
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:03,511
That is a doubling
of your money in five years.

521
00:33:03,578 --> 00:33:05,079
Is there a risk?

522
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:07,181
Well, there's a risk
in crossing the road.

523
00:33:07,248 --> 00:33:10,418
Another benefit is that
our investments assist

524
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:12,787
in the growth
of underdeveloped nations.

525
00:33:12,854 --> 00:33:15,957
So, your money would be
helping those in need.

526
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:18,593
That's nice to know,
isn't it?

527
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,662
Double my money in five years?

528
00:33:22,563 --> 00:33:24,666
A little more
wouldn't go amiss.

529
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:26,501
Now, something for you
to think about,

530
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,404
and you too, Roy,

531
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:31,906
is a way to manage
your overheads

532
00:33:31,973 --> 00:33:33,708
and streamline
the investments.

533
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:35,510
Oh, yes, what's that?

534
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:38,380
Well, to limit the administrative
costs and your tax liability,

535
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:42,550
you could both open
a joint portfolio.

536
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:45,019
You mean combine my money
with Roy's?

537
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:48,089
I'm sure you had something
similar with your late husband.

538
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:51,993
Well, yes,
but we were married.

539
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,795
Yes. True.

540
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:57,665
But a combining of the assets
is the best way

541
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:59,701
of confounding
the Inland Revenue.

542
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:08,176
Well, you certainly have given
one a lot to think about.

543
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:10,945
Thank you, um, Vincent.

544
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,825
Vincent.

545
00:34:48,883 --> 00:34:51,786
Do you ever get lonely
in here?

546
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:54,188
What?

547
00:34:54,255 --> 00:34:57,291
Oh, this room. So quiet.

548
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:03,131
Roy, it's lovely of you
to think of me,

549
00:35:03,197 --> 00:35:04,232
but if you want sex,

550
00:35:04,298 --> 00:35:06,034
I'm afraid
I'm going to have to pass.

551
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,902
Oh, no, no, no.

552
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:10,138
No, I wasn't going
to suggest that.

553
00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:14,443
Just a little cuddle.

554
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,613
I do appreciate it,
but I've always felt our relationship

555
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:21,916
was more along the lines
of a companionship.

556
00:35:21,983 --> 00:35:25,853
We've moved on
from there, surely.

557
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,891
It's not a swollen knee
that's keeping me here now.

558
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:33,495
We've developed an intimacy,

559
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:34,796
closeness.

560
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:37,632
We're close enough
that I clean your toilet.

561
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,601
And you do miss on occasion.

562
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:43,704
I apologize.

563
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:46,207
I shall attempt
to make true my aim.

564
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,611
But as to the two of us...

565
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:53,714
No, Roy. I do.
I know what you're saying.

566
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:55,583
It's just that...

567
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:58,953
Well, Alasdair and I...

568
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:02,056
Yes, I understand.

569
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:04,926
Thank you.

570
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:09,597
I know I'm no treat,

571
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:13,167
but I've grown
very fond of you, Betty.

572
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:17,439
"Fond"?
That's such an English word.

573
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:18,940
Hmm.

574
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:24,346
I've never been comfortable
with the word "love."

575
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:28,182
Not even with my wife.

576
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,820
Roy.

577
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:36,624
You just opened up to me.

578
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:42,263
Well, we should do something
to mark the occasion,

579
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:45,467
but you've already
turned me down.

580
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,839
Look, if you would like me
to say "I love you,"

581
00:36:51,906 --> 00:36:54,142
I'll certainly have
a go at it.

582
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:58,779
When the time comes.

583
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,231
Roy!

584
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:20,234
Roy!

585
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:21,603
Betty!

586
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,639
What is it?

587
00:37:23,704 --> 00:37:24,839
There was a man.

588
00:37:24,906 --> 00:37:26,941
Hang on. Okay.

589
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:54,202
Somebody tried to break in
last night.

590
00:37:54,268 --> 00:37:55,736
Do you know who?

591
00:37:55,803 --> 00:37:57,772
There's a cunt in a silver
fucking Audi keeps coming around.

592
00:37:57,838 --> 00:37:59,441
It could've been him,

593
00:38:00,975 --> 00:38:02,944
but I can't work out why.

594
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,812
Should we put it off?

595
00:38:06,348 --> 00:38:07,583
No, no.

596
00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:10,718
She'll be back from
the hairdresser's at 1:00.

597
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:13,788
So, Roy's had a doubling
of his investment.

598
00:38:13,854 --> 00:38:16,724
It's what we like to call
a "windfall."

599
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:18,627
How often
do these windfalls come?

600
00:38:18,694 --> 00:38:21,229
Oh, once or twice a year.

601
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:22,997
Oh, my God!

602
00:38:23,831 --> 00:38:25,634
£20,000?

603
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:27,502
That's like winning
the lottery.

604
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:30,171
Investing with Vincent
is like winning the lottery

605
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:31,806
and Royal Ascot.

606
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:33,808
Given the size
of your estate,

607
00:38:33,874 --> 00:38:35,377
there'd be a windfall
every week.

608
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:37,812
So, what would you...

609
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:38,879
- Mmm?
- Stephen?

610
00:38:38,946 --> 00:38:41,048
I thought you were in Spandau.

611
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:43,117
Oh, did you?

612
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:44,586
Well, they let me out early.

613
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:46,120
Oh, Stephen.

614
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:48,457
Why didn't you let me know
you were back?

615
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:49,857
You should have called.

616
00:38:49,924 --> 00:38:51,259
What have you got her doing?

617
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:53,362
So, he moves in here
with his gammy leg,

618
00:38:53,428 --> 00:38:54,929
and the first time
I leave you alone with him,

619
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:56,964
he's got you giving him
all your money.

620
00:38:57,031 --> 00:38:58,266
- No!
- No, no, no...

621
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,568
That's not what's
going on here!

622
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:01,637
That's jumping a few fences.

623
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:04,506
Listen, Roy,
do you know what?

624
00:39:04,573 --> 00:39:05,873
This isn't your house.

625
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,942
- Stephen!
- He's an intruder.

626
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:09,344
Can you see that?

627
00:39:09,411 --> 00:39:11,647
You're embarrassing me
in front of Mr. Halloran

628
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:14,048
and Roy who I...

629
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:15,316
Look, I'm sorry...

630
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:17,051
Don't touch me.

631
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:25,259
Mr. Halloran, I am very sorry.

632
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:34,469
Stephen, I know my appearance
on the scene

633
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:37,339
has altered your relationship
with your grandmother,

634
00:39:37,406 --> 00:39:42,511
but I do have an advantage
over you.

635
00:39:42,577 --> 00:39:44,211
My age.

636
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:47,482
I'm of your
grandmother's time.

637
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:50,184
The world we grew up in,
the world we knew.

638
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:54,523
And not being
a member of the family,

639
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,090
there's an added compensation

640
00:39:56,157 --> 00:39:59,226
which you might call
a romantic possibility.

641
00:40:00,995 --> 00:40:02,963
If Betty gains by something

642
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,933
that you couldn't possibly
give her,

643
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,102
good for her.

644
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:10,838
God knows it's good for me.

645
00:40:18,747 --> 00:40:20,047
Sorry.

646
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:23,217
Listen, my dear,

647
00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:25,654
what if you gave the windfall
to Stephen?

648
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:27,356
£20,000, it'd be far too much.

649
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:28,956
He wouldn't know
how to spend it.

650
00:40:33,294 --> 00:40:34,295
Then half.

651
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:38,132
10,000 for Stephen,
10,000 for us.

652
00:40:40,802 --> 00:40:41,803
Us?

653
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:43,472
That trip you mentioned.

654
00:40:43,538 --> 00:40:47,007
The one you were planning
before Alasdair died.

655
00:40:49,644 --> 00:40:51,446
Oh, Roy.

656
00:40:54,716 --> 00:40:56,618
You are the kindest person.

657
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:03,358
My own Delilah.

658
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:04,860
Can't have you going
on holiday

659
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:07,194
with all these shaggy bits.

660
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:09,230
So, where do you think
we should go?

661
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,733
Alasdair and I were planning
on going to Paris, Venice,

662
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,868
and then Berlin.

663
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:15,002
Oh, Berlin.

664
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:16,705
It's all so gray.

665
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:19,341
No, no. It's the most exciting
city in Europe at the moment.

666
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:21,942
Oh, yes.
Incredible architecture.

667
00:41:22,009 --> 00:41:24,513
And the restaurants,
and the history.

668
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:27,749
Suppose we went
the warm and sunny route?

669
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:30,585
Like Costa del Sol,

670
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:32,286
or some Greek island.

671
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:36,123
What would you think of that?

672
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,327
Betty?

673
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:42,898
Betty, are you all right?
I'll call an ambulance.

674
00:41:42,963 --> 00:41:43,964
No.

675
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:46,300
No, no, no. Call my doctor.

676
00:41:46,368 --> 00:41:48,302
His number's
on the noticeboard.

677
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:02,751
Likely you've had
another stroke.

678
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:03,819
Oh, good Lord!

679
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:05,219
Oh, I've had them before.

680
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:07,054
Very small, very tiny,

681
00:42:07,121 --> 00:42:08,723
little minor strokes.

682
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,124
Yes.

683
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:12,727
And the more you have,
the more damage they do.

684
00:42:12,794 --> 00:42:15,363
Have you been taking
the pills I prescribed?

685
00:42:17,064 --> 00:42:18,265
No.

686
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,669
There must be some treatment.

687
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:23,705
Yes. Bedrest. Surgery.

688
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:25,139
Reducing the tensions

689
00:42:25,206 --> 00:42:26,775
and activities
of my life till...

690
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:28,075
Mrs. McLeish.

691
00:42:28,142 --> 00:42:29,411
I'm not gonna do it, Doctor.

692
00:42:29,478 --> 00:42:33,348
I'm not gonna live
as if I'm already dead.

693
00:42:33,415 --> 00:42:36,384
And if you don't,
you won't live out the year.

694
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:45,259
One, two, three.

695
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:53,401
Are you all right?

696
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:57,772
When I saw you
on the floor...

697
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,476
I mean, just a blink

698
00:43:01,543 --> 00:43:03,512
and your life's
changed forever.

699
00:43:05,413 --> 00:43:06,615
You win.

700
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,550
Paris, Venice...

701
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:10,150
<i>Und</i> Berlin.

702
00:43:11,653 --> 00:43:13,153
Berlin?

703
00:43:13,688 --> 00:43:15,055
Good.

704
00:43:22,162 --> 00:43:23,598
Here you are, sir.

705
00:43:34,108 --> 00:43:35,610
No.

706
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:36,811
Um...

707
00:43:36,878 --> 00:43:38,078
Mmm.

708
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,551
Ah.

709
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:47,389
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

710
00:43:47,455 --> 00:43:50,257
And that umbrella looks as
though it's seen better days.

711
00:43:50,324 --> 00:43:51,726
That's seen me through
the war.

712
00:43:51,793 --> 00:43:54,128
Yes. On the losing side,
by the looks of it.

713
00:44:02,737 --> 00:44:03,738
Perfect.

714
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:08,476
- Thank you very much indeed.
- Thank you.

715
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:12,047
It looks very good.

716
00:44:12,112 --> 00:44:13,748
Yeah.

717
00:44:13,815 --> 00:44:17,852
Now, I'm going to show
you a pair of walking shoes

718
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:19,788
that I'm absolutely craving.

719
00:44:19,854 --> 00:44:22,357
They're right here.
There they are.

720
00:44:22,424 --> 00:44:24,158
Aren't they beautiful?

721
00:44:24,224 --> 00:44:26,328
I've had my eye on them
for ages.

722
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:27,829
But they're very expensive.

723
00:44:28,863 --> 00:44:30,197
What do you think?

724
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:33,902
Look, why don't you go in
and treat yourself?

725
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:36,638
And I'll meet you at Fortnum's
in an hour.

726
00:44:36,705 --> 00:44:38,073
For tea.

727
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:41,308
- Do you know, I think I will.
- Come on.

728
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:44,278
- In an hour. Fortnum's.
- Yes. Fortnum's.

729
00:45:15,076 --> 00:45:16,511
Excuse me!

730
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:19,514
Excuse me!

731
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,017
<i>This is Charing Cross.</i>

732
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,918
<i>This is
the Bakerloo Line train</i>

733
00:45:23,985 --> 00:45:25,487
<i>to Elephant and Castle.</i>

734
00:45:27,622 --> 00:45:29,457
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

735
00:45:29,524 --> 00:45:32,494
<i>Stand clear
of the doors, please.</i>

736
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:45,807
That was a good one
you pulled, Roy!

737
00:45:47,174 --> 00:45:48,443
The other bloke was all,

738
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,879
"Oh, don't make a fuss.
It's only money."

739
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,014
Then it hit me.

740
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:55,083
If the Russians were wired,

741
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:59,454
why didn't the police nick us
at the first meeting?

742
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:03,058
We committed fraud.
Pure and simple.

743
00:46:03,124 --> 00:46:07,261
The second meeting was
so you could double the take.

744
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:09,296
Greedy old Roy.

745
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:11,666
What do you expect me
to do?

746
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:13,601
Give me back
my 100,000 quid.

747
00:46:13,668 --> 00:46:14,836
I don't have it.

748
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:16,371
Get it!

749
00:46:16,438 --> 00:46:19,507
Or I'll tell the old bitch
you're shacked up with.

750
00:46:19,574 --> 00:46:22,977
I'm gonna break something
other than a bloody flowerpot.

751
00:46:24,112 --> 00:46:25,312
So that was you?

752
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:28,750
Clever Bryn.

753
00:46:39,293 --> 00:46:40,862
- Help, help!
- Help!

754
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:42,262
Help!

755
00:46:43,665 --> 00:46:46,701
Please, an ambulance!
We need an ambulance!

756
00:46:49,204 --> 00:46:50,304
Thank you.

757
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:51,740
God bless you.

758
00:47:00,648 --> 00:47:02,316
Out of the way, please.

759
00:47:02,383 --> 00:47:03,752
Out of the way!

760
00:47:03,818 --> 00:47:05,285
Step aside, please.

761
00:47:05,353 --> 00:47:06,654
Out of the way.

762
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:07,856
Gentleman at Charing Cross.
Responding.

763
00:47:07,922 --> 00:47:09,457
Watch out!
Out of the way, please.

764
00:47:09,524 --> 00:47:10,792
To one side.

765
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:20,869
Oh, there you are.

766
00:47:23,238 --> 00:47:24,439
New raincoat?

767
00:47:24,506 --> 00:47:26,608
Well, it seemed
necessary somehow.

768
00:47:27,242 --> 00:47:28,443
Shall we?

769
00:47:30,945 --> 00:47:33,047
I think we should move up
our flight.

770
00:47:33,114 --> 00:47:34,215
- What?
- Yes.

771
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:35,984
I've got a sudden urge
to leave.

772
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,152
Let's go tomorrow.

773
00:47:37,218 --> 00:47:38,419
Why not?

774
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:45,426
Thank you.

775
00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:57,071
Alasdair was here
at the end of the war.

776
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:01,509
He was always talking about
the Brandenburg Gate.

777
00:48:01,576 --> 00:48:04,746
What it stood for.
How it was fought over.

778
00:48:04,813 --> 00:48:07,949
And you wish he were here
to share it with you.

779
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:09,017
Don't you?

780
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:11,152
Yes.

781
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:14,355
But if he were,
I wouldn't be here with you.

782
00:48:14,956 --> 00:48:16,591
All right.

783
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:17,692
Stephen!

784
00:48:19,194 --> 00:48:20,261
Hey. I made it.

785
00:48:20,328 --> 00:48:21,529
Hello. You did.

786
00:48:23,631 --> 00:48:25,466
What are you doing here?

787
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:27,101
We thought we'd surprise you.

788
00:48:27,168 --> 00:48:30,805
Yeah. I wanted to apologize
for being an absolute shit.

789
00:48:30,872 --> 00:48:33,541
You don't know Berlin,
but I do.

790
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:36,978
So, what's first on the list?

791
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:39,247
Well, Brandenburg Gate.

792
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:40,515
Yeah.

793
00:48:50,158 --> 00:48:52,227
All that power.

794
00:48:52,293 --> 00:48:53,595
Yeah.

795
00:48:54,729 --> 00:48:56,865
All that confidence.

796
00:48:56,931 --> 00:48:58,099
Mmm.

797
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:02,437
Little did they know.

798
00:49:08,076 --> 00:49:09,410
True.

799
00:49:11,913 --> 00:49:13,448
You speak German?

800
00:49:16,484 --> 00:49:17,719
Sorry?

801
00:49:19,254 --> 00:49:21,189
I wasn't really listening.

802
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:22,857
Will you say that again?

803
00:49:22,924 --> 00:49:26,127
When they burn books,
in the end,

804
00:49:26,194 --> 00:49:27,862
they also burn people.

805
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:29,130
Yeah.

806
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:35,337
Not exactly what I was hoping
to hear on holiday.

807
00:49:44,913 --> 00:49:48,283
I didn't expect there'd be
quite so many balloons.

808
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,251
Looks like Disney runs it.

809
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:52,787
Still, preferable
to being shot at.

810
00:49:52,854 --> 00:49:54,856
Well, I wouldn't mind
shooting a few.

811
00:49:54,923 --> 00:49:56,358
I think someone's
getting cranky.

812
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:57,692
Why don't you go back
to the hotel?

813
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,494
Would you mind taking him?

814
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,962
I think I'm gonna
go exploring.

815
00:50:01,029 --> 00:50:03,598
Doctor said you weren't
to push yourself too far.

816
00:50:03,665 --> 00:50:05,466
Well, the doctor
can bugger off.

817
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:07,001
Oh.

818
00:50:08,736 --> 00:50:09,938
Do you know
how many people were shot

819
00:50:10,004 --> 00:50:11,373
trying to escape
over the wall?

820
00:50:11,439 --> 00:50:13,308
No, Stephen. I don't.

821
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,843
I suppose
you're about to tell me.

822
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:49,310
Hello?

823
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:51,279
Went the day well?

824
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:52,480
What happened?

825
00:50:52,547 --> 00:50:54,015
Oh, it's just,
I took a tumble.

826
00:50:54,082 --> 00:50:56,250
I tripped on a paving stone.

827
00:50:56,317 --> 00:50:58,186
Oh! Let me clean those hands.

828
00:50:58,252 --> 00:51:00,588
No, no, no. I can handle it.
It's fine.

829
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:02,657
No. You can sit down.

830
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,593
Oh, you're huffing
and puffing.

831
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,062
Your heart's
going a mile a minute.

832
00:51:10,198 --> 00:51:12,100
Now, come on.

833
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:13,634
It has to be done.

834
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:24,679
Ooh. Hmm?

835
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:28,049
oh.

836
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,686
- Was it one of your spells?
- No.

837
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:34,522
One minute I was up,
the next minute I was down.

838
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:37,892
It's this place.
There's so much history.

839
00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:40,895
Everything is built
on a heroic scale

840
00:51:40,962 --> 00:51:42,764
that makes you
feel powerless and...

841
00:51:44,298 --> 00:51:45,600
There we are.

842
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:47,635
All done.

843
00:51:50,738 --> 00:51:53,041
Roy's made it all better.

844
00:51:57,145 --> 00:51:58,646
Hey, hey. Sorry.

845
00:51:58,713 --> 00:52:00,815
Have you got
the address, Stephen?

846
00:52:00,882 --> 00:52:01,783
Uh, yes.

847
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:03,651
But first,
a stop along the way.

848
00:52:03,718 --> 00:52:05,086
The restaurant's
booked at 8:00.

849
00:52:05,153 --> 00:52:07,655
Yeah, trust me,
it will be worth it.

850
00:52:37,352 --> 00:52:38,986
What is this place?

851
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:40,721
Humor me.

852
00:53:09,617 --> 00:53:13,121
The owner's allowed us
use of this flat.

853
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:50,791
It's changed a bit.

854
00:53:52,693 --> 00:53:53,895
Hmm?

855
00:53:53,961 --> 00:53:56,831
Since you were
last here, Roy.

856
00:53:56,898 --> 00:53:58,400
Stephen, what are you doing?

857
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:01,135
I accessed
his service records.

858
00:54:02,404 --> 00:54:03,738
Roy Courtnay.

859
00:54:03,804 --> 00:54:07,409
Born Dorset. Only child.
Father a vicar.

860
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:10,178
Lieutenant British Army
of the Rhine.

861
00:54:10,244 --> 00:54:13,981
Wounded. Berlin.
At this address.

862
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:17,151
Well, yes. Roy told us
he was wounded in the war.

863
00:54:17,218 --> 00:54:21,022
Yes, but this was three years
after the war.

864
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:24,892
And it involved a murder.

865
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:26,794
See, at that time,
Berlin was cut into zones.

866
00:54:26,861 --> 00:54:28,664
American, French,
Russian, British.

867
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:30,131
Lieutenant Roy Courtnay
was assigned

868
00:54:30,198 --> 00:54:32,300
to something called
V Section,

869
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:33,569
headquartered here.

870
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:35,604
Oh, Stephen,
I must correct you.

871
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:38,706
V Section was not
headquartered in Berlin,

872
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:40,308
it was a division
of intelligence,

873
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:43,144
based in Hanover,
reporting directly to London.

874
00:54:43,211 --> 00:54:47,416
We were in the business
of hunting Nazis.

875
00:54:48,816 --> 00:54:50,151
V Section had got wind

876
00:54:50,218 --> 00:54:52,286
that there was a man
hiding out in Berlin.

877
00:54:52,354 --> 00:54:54,356
Martin Geiger.

878
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:56,991
Not a trivial catch.

879
00:54:57,058 --> 00:55:00,795
No. He'd been an administrator
at Bergen-Belsen.

880
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:09,504
<i>So, I was driven
into the Soviet Zone</i>

881
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:13,007
<i>by my German translator,
Hans Taub.</i>

882
00:55:16,177 --> 00:55:18,614
<i>It was my first time
in Berlin.</i>

883
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,718
<i>But Taub, Taub had come home.</i>

884
00:55:22,783 --> 00:55:25,454
Must be strange
coming back to all this.

885
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,556
I hate this city.

886
00:55:27,623 --> 00:55:29,857
People who lived here
deserved what they got.

887
00:55:29,924 --> 00:55:31,393
But surely your family...

888
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,295
My father died before the war.
The rest soon after.

889
00:55:35,796 --> 00:55:37,098
I have no family.

890
00:55:45,273 --> 00:55:47,842
<i>Taub was a lost soul.</i>

891
00:55:47,908 --> 00:55:51,212
<i>The war had left him old
before his time.</i>

892
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,148
Once we finish,

893
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:56,984
find a nice bar,
chat up a couple of girls.

894
00:55:57,051 --> 00:55:58,620
What do you think?

895
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:00,187
Better to pay for one.

896
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,125
The price these days
is not so much.

897
00:56:08,363 --> 00:56:10,332
<i>And to arrest Geiger,</i>

898
00:56:10,399 --> 00:56:12,967
<i>we needed
the Soviets' approval.</i>

899
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:14,969
<i>We had to wear
civilian clothes.</i>

900
00:56:15,036 --> 00:56:17,372
<i>No dogtags.
Nothing to identify us.</i>

901
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,977
<i>Geiger was staying
with a friend, Franz Konig.</i>

902
00:56:23,044 --> 00:56:25,380
Here. You're right.

903
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:27,616
In this flat.

904
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:29,551
<i>The plan was that
we would come here</i>

905
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:31,420
<i>while Geiger was at work,</i>

906
00:56:31,486 --> 00:56:34,989
<i>say that we were German police
and wait for him.</i>

907
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:39,093
<i>A routine lift.</i>

908
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:45,266
<i>Except that the war
hadn't really ended in Berlin.</i>

909
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:48,269
Make the smallest mistake

910
00:56:48,337 --> 00:56:52,774
and you could end up
in enemy territory.

911
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,912
I didn't speak German,
so I left the talking to Taub.

912
00:57:23,772 --> 00:57:26,107
<i>Taub did the heavy lifting.</i>

913
00:57:26,173 --> 00:57:29,411
<i>All I had to do
was keep my bloody mouth shut.</i>

914
00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:20,227
Uh... <i>Ja. Danke.</i>

915
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:55,430
English.

916
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:00,234
Geiger.

917
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:01,536
Come in.

918
00:59:10,177 --> 00:59:11,546
Put the gun down.

919
00:59:13,214 --> 00:59:14,416
Just leave.

920
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,050
Gun!

921
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,087
Okay. All right.

922
01:00:11,105 --> 01:00:12,774
Hans Taub was killed.

923
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:16,243
Geiger got away.

924
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,780
Actually, no.

925
01:00:22,249 --> 01:00:24,251
Martin Geiger
was caught two weeks later

926
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:26,588
by a Soviet patrol.

927
01:00:26,655 --> 01:00:32,694
His confession was very clear
about what had taken place.

928
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:35,262
Who was dead.

929
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:39,467
And who wasn't.

930
01:00:48,175 --> 01:00:50,210
It all happened so quickly.

931
01:01:06,595 --> 01:01:10,264
<i>When I opened my eyes,
I saw him lying there.</i>

932
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:15,036
<i>Courtnay. Roy Courtnay.</i>

933
01:01:15,102 --> 01:01:16,805
<i>His face shot off.</i>

934
01:01:18,473 --> 01:01:21,776
<i>I don't know how long
it took me to work it out.</i>

935
01:01:25,814 --> 01:01:28,450
<i>Nothing could bring
Roy Courtnay back.</i>

936
01:01:28,516 --> 01:01:31,620
<i>His family would never
set eyes on him again.</i>

937
01:01:31,686 --> 01:01:34,321
But Taub, his...

938
01:01:36,825 --> 01:01:38,493
My family,

939
01:01:39,828 --> 01:01:41,128
they were all dead.

940
01:01:41,195 --> 01:01:42,864
No one was waiting.

941
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:45,900
No one would mourn.

942
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:50,170
<i>Becoming an Englishman
wouldn't be difficult.</i>

943
01:01:50,237 --> 01:01:53,375
<i>I'd been teaching the language
since I was 14 years old.</i>

944
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:54,943
<i>At headquarters,</i>

945
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,645
<i>people had often remarked
on the resemblance</i>

946
01:01:56,711 --> 01:01:59,914
<i>between Lieutenant Courtnay
and me.</i>

947
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:04,919
<i>This was my chance
to get out.</i>

948
01:02:04,986 --> 01:02:06,454
<i>To leave behind the country</i>

949
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,556
<i>that had given me
a lifetime of misery.</i>

950
01:02:11,493 --> 01:02:13,728
<i>I could start over.</i>

951
01:02:13,795 --> 01:02:16,731
<i>Be on the winning side
for once.</i>

952
01:02:19,134 --> 01:02:21,503
I crossed into
the British Zone,

953
01:02:21,569 --> 01:02:23,203
talked my way
onto a transport plane

954
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:27,241
and I was in England
by next morning.

955
01:02:27,307 --> 01:02:31,446
I typed a letter to the reverend and Mrs.
J. L. Courtnay

956
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:34,248
on their son's Remington

957
01:02:34,314 --> 01:02:37,085
informing them
that my experiences in Germany

958
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:39,354
had changed me irrevocably.

959
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:42,189
That I saw
a different future for myself,

960
01:02:42,256 --> 01:02:45,160
and that as my decision
was final,

961
01:02:45,225 --> 01:02:49,296
a clean break
was the best solution.

962
01:02:49,364 --> 01:02:52,634
All expressed kindly,
rationally.

963
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:56,270
With love.

964
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:01,241
When that was over,

965
01:03:01,308 --> 01:03:05,647
I changed my name
to Roy Manning

966
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:09,784
and I waited for them to die.

967
01:03:09,851 --> 01:03:14,355
Yes. And when they did,
Roy Courtnay reemerged.

968
01:03:16,157 --> 01:03:17,692
May I ask,

969
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:21,162
what it is you hope
to accomplish with all this?

970
01:03:21,228 --> 01:03:22,764
Justice.

971
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:25,299
A man named Hans Taub,
presumed dead,

972
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:27,602
has been roaming the earth
for 60 years,

973
01:03:27,669 --> 01:03:31,106
not having paid the price for
a single crime he committed!

974
01:03:31,172 --> 01:03:34,943
Hans Taub wasn't
a war criminal.

975
01:03:35,009 --> 01:03:36,377
He was conscripted.

976
01:03:36,444 --> 01:03:38,847
He served in the infantry,
both fronts!

977
01:03:38,913 --> 01:03:42,617
Oh, you think you've caught
yourself a Nazi, don't you?

978
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:44,753
Well, have you looked
in the <i>Dienststelle?</i>

979
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:46,621
The personnel files,
the military trials?

980
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:48,056
Yes.

981
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:50,024
And did you see anything there
that implicated Hans Taub?

982
01:03:50,091 --> 01:03:52,727
- No.
- The Russian files?

983
01:03:52,794 --> 01:03:53,862
Anything there?

984
01:03:53,928 --> 01:03:56,397
Well, not that
I can find. No.

985
01:03:56,464 --> 01:03:57,732
Nothing then.

986
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:01,069
For the last half century,

987
01:04:01,136 --> 01:04:02,771
I have lived as honestly

988
01:04:02,837 --> 01:04:04,506
and as decently
as any Englishman.

989
01:04:04,572 --> 01:04:06,007
Honestly? You may not be
a war criminal,

990
01:04:06,074 --> 01:04:07,408
but there are plenty
of other crimes...

991
01:04:07,475 --> 01:04:08,676
Stephen, enough!

992
01:04:10,912 --> 01:04:12,680
You assume it's necessary
to save your grandmother

993
01:04:12,747 --> 01:04:14,415
from all sorts
of imaginary dangers.

994
01:04:14,482 --> 01:04:16,551
Look, you don't know him!

995
01:04:16,618 --> 01:04:18,787
I make my own choices.

996
01:04:18,853 --> 01:04:20,722
And I don't need
your permission.

997
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:22,657
If you can't respect that,
then I think it's just as well

998
01:04:22,724 --> 01:04:25,460
that we don't
see each other for a while.

999
01:04:35,937 --> 01:04:37,872
Obviously, I'm intruding.

1000
01:04:50,018 --> 01:04:51,352
Mmm.

1001
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,789
Do you know who you are?

1002
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:01,729
You're the only person
on this planet

1003
01:05:01,796 --> 01:05:04,399
who makes me feel
that I'm not alone.

1004
01:05:09,237 --> 01:05:12,073
Oh, to hell with
Venice and Paris,

1005
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:14,976
let's go home.

1006
01:05:26,154 --> 01:05:27,989
Oh.

1007
01:05:28,056 --> 01:05:29,123
Glad to be home.

1008
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:30,692
Oh, yes.

1009
01:05:31,726 --> 01:05:33,595
Roy.

1010
01:05:33,661 --> 01:05:36,531
- Why don't you call Vincent?
- What?

1011
01:05:36,598 --> 01:05:38,967
Let's go forward
with the joint account.

1012
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,539
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1013
01:06:02,991 --> 01:06:05,793
So, we're going
to do the usual?

1014
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:11,199
I transfer my funds,
she transfers hers,

1015
01:06:11,266 --> 01:06:15,103
and then I suck the money
out of the account.

1016
01:06:15,169 --> 01:06:16,704
You're gonna take the lot?

1017
01:06:16,771 --> 01:06:19,841
It's nearly £3,000,000.

1018
01:06:19,908 --> 01:06:21,576
After a lifetime of effort,

1019
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:26,581
where a good score is 100,000
split too many ways,

1020
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:30,184
yeah, you bloody bet
I'm gonna take it all.

1021
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:33,221
It's what we like to call
a windfall.

1022
01:06:33,288 --> 01:06:34,555
Oh, it wouldn't hurt

1023
01:06:34,622 --> 01:06:36,524
to leave her a bit though,
would it?

1024
01:06:36,591 --> 01:06:37,892
When I'm running down
the hill,

1025
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:39,361
I don't want to
have to depend

1026
01:06:39,427 --> 01:06:40,662
on the fucking
National Health Service.

1027
01:06:40,728 --> 01:06:42,463
I plan on having enough money

1028
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:45,266
to just sit on a beach,
sipping champagne.

1029
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,536
Is that why you think
you do it? For the money?

1030
01:06:48,603 --> 01:06:51,973
It's the game.
It's the adrenaline rush.

1031
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,207
What if it is?

1032
01:06:53,274 --> 01:06:55,143
You get just as big a jolt

1033
01:06:55,209 --> 01:06:57,679
if you left her
a little bit to live on.

1034
01:06:57,745 --> 01:06:59,314
What am I now, a charity?

1035
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:00,715
No.

1036
01:07:00,782 --> 01:07:04,519
But, this one,
she's pretty ill, isn't she?

1037
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:06,955
Well, do you think
I don't know that?

1038
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:10,258
And who do you think's
been caring for her?

1039
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,526
I see to it that she gets

1040
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:12,961
the right pills
at the right time.

1041
01:07:13,027 --> 01:07:16,332
I make certain
she's in bed at a decent hour.

1042
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:19,300
No refined sugar, no caffeine.
No talk of politics

1043
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,370
or her bloody blood pressure
goes through the roof!

1044
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,972
I don't need you to tell me
that she's ill for...

1045
01:07:28,643 --> 01:07:30,511
You don't wanna do this, Roy.

1046
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,814
Don't I?

1047
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:45,093
Don't tell me
what I want, Vin.

1048
01:07:46,127 --> 01:07:48,830
I'll do what I do.

1049
01:07:49,864 --> 01:07:51,232
If your feet
are getting cold...

1050
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:52,500
No.

1051
01:07:53,034 --> 01:07:54,168
Mmm-mmm.

1052
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,209
I'm in.

1053
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:02,877
Good.

1054
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:07,582
I'll just close up here and
then it's onto the next flat.

1055
01:08:09,451 --> 01:08:11,119
And the next Roy.

1056
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,120
Are you having
second thoughts?

1057
01:08:46,187 --> 01:08:48,656
No. Not a bit.

1058
01:08:56,864 --> 01:08:58,833
To the matter
of the joint trust.

1059
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,168
Are you both agreed

1060
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:03,004
to the combining
of your individual assets?

1061
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:05,573
I am.

1062
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:06,974
I am.

1063
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:10,546
Please, sign here.
Here and here.

1064
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:12,180
Both copies.

1065
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:29,230
So, shall we effect
the transfer?

1066
01:09:31,366 --> 01:09:33,167
Yes.

1067
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:35,903
The bank here is Hayes &
Paulsen in the Caribbean,

1068
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:39,740
and with these keypads, you can log
into your joint account at any time

1069
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:42,844
to see how well
your investments are doing.

1070
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:45,813
Betty, will you please
transfer your funds

1071
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,715
into the joint account?

1072
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,750
Uh...

1073
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:51,619
Um...

1074
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,256
I wonder, I mean,

1075
01:09:55,323 --> 01:09:57,593
is it wise
to transfer all of it?

1076
01:09:57,692 --> 01:10:00,462
To take it
right down to zero?

1077
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:05,299
I mean, wouldn't it be a good
idea maybe to leave a bit?

1078
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:08,102
That would be prudent,
wouldn't it?

1079
01:10:13,841 --> 01:10:17,111
True. It might be.

1080
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:19,780
But, um, it's also true
that the less one puts in,

1081
01:10:19,847 --> 01:10:21,517
the less one gets in return.

1082
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,751
Ah, well, that is a point.

1083
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:25,153
Mmm.

1084
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,055
It's just that...

1085
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:32,727
Well, I had a recent...

1086
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:34,061
Um...

1087
01:10:35,196 --> 01:10:36,365
Vincent...

1088
01:10:36,431 --> 01:10:39,434
Betty has had some
health issues of late.

1089
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:41,002
Nothing terribly serious,

1090
01:10:41,068 --> 01:10:44,005
but it does make one think
twice before taking a risk

1091
01:10:44,071 --> 01:10:47,108
even on such
sound investments.

1092
01:10:47,175 --> 01:10:52,180
Which is why I've been
holding back a bit myself.

1093
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,228
1-7-1...

1094
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:12,401
7-7-6.

1095
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:15,136
I put in everything.

1096
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,411
Everything.

1097
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,082
You certainly have.

1098
01:11:33,287 --> 01:11:35,056
Ooh!

1099
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:37,959
You've been hiding your light
under a bushel as well.

1100
01:11:38,025 --> 01:11:40,629
No, no. I said I was thrifty.

1101
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:42,930
And then some.

1102
01:11:49,303 --> 01:11:51,105
I'm all in, too.

1103
01:11:54,175 --> 01:11:57,278
Roy, will you now
deposit your funds?

1104
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:00,248
Um...

1105
01:12:05,152 --> 01:12:07,021
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1106
01:12:07,088 --> 01:12:09,257
So, now for security
and so that only

1107
01:12:09,323 --> 01:12:11,259
you two have access
to the joint account,

1108
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:13,662
you need to create a passcode.

1109
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,997
Um, six letters.

1110
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,033
Uh, some...

1111
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:21,168
What about that?

1112
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,006
Well, flowers?

1113
01:12:25,072 --> 01:12:27,643
No, that's seven letters,
isn't it? It is.

1114
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:29,910
No, no. The kind of flowers.

1115
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,414
Oh, lilies! Oh.

1116
01:12:34,181 --> 01:12:35,350
Nice.

1117
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,051
Well, if that's your choice,

1118
01:12:37,118 --> 01:12:40,121
please type "lilies"
into your pads.

1119
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:47,529
I. L. L.

1120
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:51,566
- Done! Ha! Congratulations!
- Yes.

1121
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:03,911
I think we should celebrate
with champagne.

1122
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:06,782
Well, I would,
but I'm afraid I'm driving.

1123
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:08,517
Oh.

1124
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:09,718
Don't you want to get that?

1125
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,920
What? Oh! No. Right.

1126
01:13:14,188 --> 01:13:16,525
Vincent, thank you.

1127
01:13:18,926 --> 01:13:20,562
Thank you.

1128
01:13:30,938 --> 01:13:32,507
Until next time.

1129
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:05,940
What are we drinking to?

1130
01:14:06,006 --> 01:14:07,642
What we must always
drink to,

1131
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:08,976
the future.

1132
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:11,078
The future.

1133
01:14:11,145 --> 01:14:12,279
How should we spend
the profits

1134
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:13,648
when they start to come in?

1135
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,417
I thought maybe
we could book a cruise,

1136
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,486
or we could get one of those
timeshares in Mallorca.

1137
01:14:17,552 --> 01:14:18,953
Yes, we could.

1138
01:14:19,019 --> 01:14:20,756
Anyway, we don't
have to decide now.

1139
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:22,923
Oh, no, no, there's plenty
of time for all that.

1140
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:24,793
The important thing is

1141
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,061
it's all packed away
in one place,

1142
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:28,663
where it's safe and sound.

1143
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,365
Like us.

1144
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:32,166
Oh, hadn't you better
check your mobile?

1145
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:34,201
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

1146
01:14:34,268 --> 01:14:36,303
That call.
Was there a message?

1147
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:39,073
Was there? I don't know.

1148
01:14:42,977 --> 01:14:44,413
Mmm.

1149
01:14:45,913 --> 01:14:48,115
- It's my son.
- Robert?

1150
01:14:48,182 --> 01:14:50,184
Yeah. He's in London.

1151
01:14:54,155 --> 01:14:56,056
Had some kitchen show.

1152
01:14:56,123 --> 01:14:57,992
He's flying away
to Canada tomorrow,

1153
01:14:58,058 --> 01:15:00,595
wants to know would I
like to see him tonight.

1154
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,564
- Oh, you must!
- No.

1155
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,436
We're not close.

1156
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:10,171
Roy, he's your son.
I'll drive you.

1157
01:15:10,237 --> 01:15:11,773
I'd love to meet Robert.

1158
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,008
Oh, no, no.

1159
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:19,180
I'll take the train.

1160
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,698
I doubt there's
much chance of it,

1161
01:16:09,764 --> 01:16:13,100
but if we go to dinner
and it gets late,

1162
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:15,370
well, then I might stay over.

1163
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:17,572
- Oh, yes, that's a good idea.
- Yeah.

1164
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,407
Why don't you grab some water
for the journey?

1165
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:20,976
You don't want
to get dehydrated.

1166
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:23,010
Oh, thank you.

1167
01:16:23,077 --> 01:16:24,379
- Cupboard on the left.
- Right.

1168
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,013
Top shelf right at the back.

1169
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,249
Oh, dear, this one?

1170
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,084
Oh, yeah.

1171
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,498
I don't think I'll go, um...

1172
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:50,539
Why should I when I can
stay right here with you?

1173
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:57,278
I do love you, you know.

1174
01:17:01,081 --> 01:17:02,484
Stick to the plan, Roy.

1175
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:06,086
Go to London.
See your son.

1176
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:13,160
<i>Train now
approaching Platform 4.</i>

1177
01:17:30,378 --> 01:17:32,347
- After you.
- Oh, thank you.

1178
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:52,961
<i>This is Vincent Halloran.</i>

1179
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:55,295
<i>Please leave your name
and number after the tone.</i>

1180
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,432
Get over to the fucking flat.

1181
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:00,335
I don't have
the fucking keypad!

1182
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,437
Cunt's got
one fucking thing to do.

1183
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:03,805
Stay near the fucking phone!

1184
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:08,376
Fucking cunt
can't even get that right.

1185
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:09,744
<i>Hayes & Paulsen.</i>

1186
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,513
<i>This is Shayla.
How may I help you?</i>

1187
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:14,082
Yes. My name's Roy Courtnay.

1188
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:18,520
I'm trying to transfer
some funds from my account.

1189
01:19:18,586 --> 01:19:21,623
And I've left
my keypad at home.

1190
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,025
<i>We can courier
another keypad to you.</i>

1191
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:27,429
<i>I just need to ask you
a few security questions.</i>

1192
01:19:27,495 --> 01:19:31,132
And how long would it take
to get the new pad to me?

1193
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:32,734
<i>A couple of days.</i>

1194
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,469
Hmm.

1195
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:39,407
Is there any way I can do
the transfer over the phone?

1196
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,409
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1197
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,310
<i>But I'm afraid you're gonna have
to go home and get that pad.</i>

1198
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:46,114
Yes, you're right. I am.

1199
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:25,920
Betty?

1200
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,635
Betty!

1201
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:57,185
What are you doing here, Roy?

1202
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,387
Oh, Robert's flight
was delayed.

1203
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:01,990
Oh, dear.
How did you find out?

1204
01:21:02,056 --> 01:21:02,924
He called.

1205
01:21:05,326 --> 01:21:09,063
Betty. Where is everything?

1206
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,667
What's that you're doing?

1207
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:14,636
Oh, I was looking
at our joint account.

1208
01:21:14,702 --> 01:21:18,640
I've entered the passcode,
so I am as you say "in."

1209
01:21:18,706 --> 01:21:22,210
Now, every time you lie,
I press this button

1210
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:25,280
and £50,000
leaves our joint account

1211
01:21:25,346 --> 01:21:26,881
and goes into another account.

1212
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:29,851
Different passcode,
different bank.

1213
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:31,820
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1214
01:21:33,354 --> 01:21:35,223
You just lost £50,000.

1215
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,559
I haven't the slightest idea.

1216
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:42,096
- Another 50.
- Betty, it's me.

1217
01:21:43,731 --> 01:21:45,500
Roy.

1218
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:48,236
I mean Hans.

1219
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:49,804
Now, tell me again,

1220
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,006
how did Robert let you know
his flight was delayed?

1221
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,775
Well, he called me.

1222
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:56,077
Well, I mean that he left
a message for me.

1223
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:57,345
Oh, Betty.

1224
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:59,714
Oh, for God's sake.
I don't know.

1225
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,083
I don't know.

1226
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:03,551
So, now you're calculating

1227
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:07,322
how much you can lose
before it gets serious.

1228
01:22:07,388 --> 01:22:09,357
Let me save you some money.

1229
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:13,561
You came back for this.

1230
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:17,999
Oh, well, I did notice
that I didn't have it with me.

1231
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,201
Mmm, you thought
you'd taken it to London.

1232
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,970
I thought I had.

1233
01:22:22,036 --> 01:22:25,473
And it was so important
you came all the way back.

1234
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,675
Well, no reason
to spend the night in town,

1235
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:30,078
if you can come home.

1236
01:22:30,144 --> 01:22:31,746
Does this look like home?

1237
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:37,552
Isn't it beginning to sink in
just a little bit?

1238
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:42,957
Betty, what the hell
is going on?

1239
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:46,561
Oh, my, you are slipping,
aren't you, Roy?

1240
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,429
Robert didn't call
or leave you a message

1241
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:50,565
because there is no Robert.

1242
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,433
You have no son.

1243
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:56,271
Come on, Roy,

1244
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:57,906
you must see it.

1245
01:22:57,972 --> 01:23:00,909
It's been right in front
of you the whole time.

1246
01:23:11,185 --> 01:23:12,687
Flowers?

1247
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,789
Lilies.

1248
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:27,669
Lili?

1249
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,244
Hans.

1250
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,180
<i>Back then, Friday was
my favorite day of the week.</i>

1251
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:42,850
<i>Friday was when Hans Taub
came to teach me English.</i>

1252
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,391
<i>I wanted
to greet you myself,</i>

1253
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:50,725
but you came early
and I wasn't ready.

1254
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,293
So Mother had you wait.

1255
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:07,842
Your daughter is a
very good pupil, <i>Frau</i> Schroder.

1256
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:11,579
She says you speak
in English only.

1257
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:14,482
That is the point
of learning it.

1258
01:24:53,654 --> 01:24:55,757
<i>I've often wondered</i>

1259
01:24:55,823 --> 01:24:58,559
<i>what if I'd been
ready earlier.</i>

1260
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:01,129
If you'd never seen
my sisters that day.

1261
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,199
Hmm.

1262
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:35,696
Hans.

1263
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:10,091
Hans!

1264
01:27:12,226 --> 01:27:14,195
I am ready
for my English lesson.

1265
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:37,118
It's pretty, isn't it?

1266
01:27:42,723 --> 01:27:45,193
This is the lock of hair
that you gave me.

1267
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:52,334
<i>I suppose
I worshipped you.</i>

1268
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:55,036
But you never noticed.

1269
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,007
Do you like me, Hans?

1270
01:28:01,842 --> 01:28:02,910
The look on your face.

1271
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:04,245
You never
considered the question.

1272
01:28:07,349 --> 01:28:09,183
I'm fond of you.

1273
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:14,789
Does "fond" mean "love"?

1274
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:22,897
Stand up.

1275
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:27,969
Here.

1276
01:28:37,044 --> 01:28:39,880
"Stand absolutely still,"
you said.

1277
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,650
Close your eyes.

1278
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:44,151
"And close your eyes."

1279
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:22,790
And then you raped me.

1280
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:30,565
<i>As consolation
for your humiliation.</i>

1281
01:29:30,632 --> 01:29:32,166
<i>As revenge.</i>

1282
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,369
I was small.

1283
01:29:34,436 --> 01:29:37,773
I was easier to manage
than my sisters.

1284
01:29:39,441 --> 01:29:41,809
<i>I was less of a stranger.
Less of a challenge.</i>

1285
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,516
It was over very quickly.

1286
01:29:49,418 --> 01:29:51,952
<i>When you were finished,
I remember thinking...</i>

1287
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,356
<i>"I must put on a clean dress."</i>

1288
01:29:58,959 --> 01:30:00,194
Lili?

1289
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:02,624
Hans!

1290
01:31:07,362 --> 01:31:08,530
Lili?

1291
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:39,361
<i>Two days
later, my father was arrested.</i>

1292
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:45,567
<i>Someone had denounced him
as a traitor.</i>

1293
01:31:45,634 --> 01:31:48,570
<i>He was tried, found guilty,
and hanged.</i>

1294
01:31:48,637 --> 01:31:53,007
<i>The money, the factory,
everything was confiscated.</i>

1295
01:31:53,073 --> 01:31:54,843
<i>It was all too much
for my mother,</i>

1296
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:57,446
<i>so she committed suicide.</i>

1297
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,047
And then it was
just the four of us.

1298
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:01,450
Well, we took in boarders.

1299
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,984
First they paid,
but then they couldn't.

1300
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:07,254
And then towards
the end of the war,

1301
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:08,657
my sisters were
in the kitchen

1302
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:11,793
trying to make three eggs
feed a dozen people.

1303
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,695
And a bomb struck.

1304
01:32:14,596 --> 01:32:16,297
Killed them all.

1305
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,302
They'd let me sleep,
so I was unharmed.

1306
01:32:23,672 --> 01:32:27,442
Two weeks later,
Hitler committed suicide.

1307
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:33,482
And then the Russians came.

1308
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:38,285
You know, it's very peculiar
doing things

1309
01:32:38,353 --> 01:32:40,922
you'd never
in your life imagined,

1310
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:44,024
just so that you can live
another day

1311
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:46,461
to do them all again,
and more.

1312
01:32:46,528 --> 01:32:47,662
And worse.

1313
01:32:49,698 --> 01:32:56,338
Secrets between you, God,
the devil and the dead.

1314
01:32:58,974 --> 01:33:00,107
Lying.

1315
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:03,378
Becoming a very good liar.

1316
01:33:04,546 --> 01:33:05,714
Betty...

1317
01:33:06,648 --> 01:33:07,716
Lili...

1318
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:12,354
I never intended you any harm.

1319
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,489
When you denounced my father,

1320
01:33:14,556 --> 01:33:16,223
what did you imagine
would happen?

1321
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:17,692
Well, I suppose
I should have known

1322
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:20,662
that your family would be
in some kind of trouble.

1323
01:33:20,729 --> 01:33:23,565
How could I calculate
these things? I was a child.

1324
01:33:23,632 --> 01:33:24,966
You were 15!

1325
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:28,035
You knew exactly what
you were doing, didn't you?

1326
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:30,438
Well, I suppose...

1327
01:33:30,505 --> 01:33:31,840
Well, I don't know.

1328
01:33:31,907 --> 01:33:34,943
Do not do that
one more time.

1329
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:39,381
Your sisters humiliated me.
Your father wronged me.

1330
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,783
I wanted to teach you
a lesson.

1331
01:33:42,517 --> 01:33:44,786
And there it is.

1332
01:33:44,853 --> 01:33:46,053
Oh, Betty.

1333
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,122
Why did you go
to all this trouble?

1334
01:33:48,188 --> 01:33:49,491
Once you'd found me,

1335
01:33:49,558 --> 01:33:51,292
you could have
just talked to me.

1336
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:53,562
Well, I doubt
whether I would have

1337
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:55,062
accomplished very much
if I'd said...

1338
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:56,998
"Hello, I'm Lili Schroder.

1339
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:59,834
"I'm the girl you raped
in 1943."

1340
01:33:59,901 --> 01:34:03,705
Talk to you, Roy? No.
First I needed to study you.

1341
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:06,441
<i>Fortunately, Stephen</i>

1342
01:34:06,508 --> 01:34:08,810
<i>is an absolutely
brilliant researcher.</i>

1343
01:34:08,877 --> 01:34:12,914
<i>So it wasn't difficult for him
to track your criminal career.</i>

1344
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:15,850
<i>You even appeared in
the newspaper a few times,</i>

1345
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:18,053
<i>which helped me
become precisely</i>

1346
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:20,120
<i>the kind of naive
older woman</i>

1347
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:23,223
- <i>you like to victimize.</i>
- Estelle?

1348
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:27,562
Well, you've had your fun.

1349
01:34:27,629 --> 01:34:29,664
But so what? Hmm?

1350
01:34:29,731 --> 01:34:32,367
There's nothing to connect me
with Taub.

1351
01:34:32,434 --> 01:34:33,702
Do you remember
our last day in Berlin

1352
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:34,836
when I went exploring?

1353
01:34:34,903 --> 01:34:36,438
When you fell.

1354
01:34:37,906 --> 01:34:40,875
<i>I went back
to my family's house.</i>

1355
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:44,446
<i>You'd barely recognize it.</i>

1356
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,114
<i>It's a children's charity.</i>

1357
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:50,518
Hello, I'm Betty McLeish.

1358
01:34:51,987 --> 01:34:53,187
<i>Danke schon.</i>

1359
01:35:02,831 --> 01:35:04,366
<i>There was no reason
to believe I'd find</i>

1360
01:35:04,432 --> 01:35:06,534
<i>what I was searching for.</i>

1361
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:46,741
Ahh!

1362
01:36:29,417 --> 01:36:34,556
<i>My silver locket
with your hair in it.</i>

1363
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,092
You see,
I already had a sample.

1364
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:44,264
Oh, Betty,

1365
01:36:44,332 --> 01:36:45,400
you know I could have kept

1366
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:47,234
going tonight,
but I came back.

1367
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:50,171
You came back for this.

1368
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:52,272
But I'd moved
all of my money out

1369
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:53,842
as soon as your train
left the station.

1370
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:57,345
Vincent helped me with
the very, um, technical bits.

1371
01:36:57,412 --> 01:36:59,080
- Vincent?
- Yes!

1372
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:02,350
<i>Stephen had a word with him
before we left for Berlin.</i>

1373
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:03,818
<i>I think he put it to him</i>

1374
01:37:03,885 --> 01:37:05,520
<i>that multiple charges
of forgery,</i>

1375
01:37:05,587 --> 01:37:06,788
fraud, and extortion

1376
01:37:06,855 --> 01:37:08,556
were not the legacy
he might want

1377
01:37:08,623 --> 01:37:10,525
to leave his children.

1378
01:37:10,592 --> 01:37:11,826
Did he try to warn you?

1379
01:37:11,893 --> 01:37:13,862
We were rather afraid
that he might.

1380
01:37:13,928 --> 01:37:15,130
Oh, and by the way,

1381
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:16,431
you know Stephen's
not my grandson.

1382
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:18,066
I mean,
I do have grandchildren,

1383
01:37:18,133 --> 01:37:20,735
too many of them to count,
but Stephen's not one of them.

1384
01:37:20,802 --> 01:37:23,638
Oh, you did meet one
actually. Michael.

1385
01:37:23,705 --> 01:37:25,940
You know, the chap
in the silver Audi.

1386
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:29,010
<i>He's very protective
of his gran.</i>

1387
01:37:29,077 --> 01:37:30,979
Stephen's his partner.

1388
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:35,750
Yes, they were very helpful in
setting the stage for our little play.

1389
01:37:35,817 --> 01:37:39,521
<i>Every bland detail
carefully chosen</i>

1390
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:42,157
<i>to lull you into
a sense of complacency.</i>

1391
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:44,192
There.

1392
01:37:44,259 --> 01:37:47,428
Boring Betty
in her boring house.

1393
01:37:47,495 --> 01:37:49,063
What an easy mark
she'll make.

1394
01:37:50,565 --> 01:37:52,734
Your strokes? That doctor.

1395
01:37:52,801 --> 01:37:54,803
I suppose
all that was a lie, too?

1396
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:57,705
Yes, of course.
He's a friend of mine.

1397
01:37:57,772 --> 01:37:59,140
We wanted to soften you up

1398
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:00,942
so you'd put all of your
money into the account.

1399
01:38:02,644 --> 01:38:04,546
And why,

1400
01:38:04,612 --> 01:38:06,781
after all these decades?

1401
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:10,985
Why do all this?

1402
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:13,755
Because for 60 years,

1403
01:38:13,822 --> 01:38:16,524
I've been locked in that room
with you.

1404
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:21,763
And the only way to free
myself was to face you.

1405
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:23,965
Do you want me
to ask forgiveness?

1406
01:38:24,032 --> 01:38:26,501
I will. Yeah.

1407
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:31,840
I beg you.

1408
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:36,544
Oh, Roy. I forgave you
a long time ago.

1409
01:38:41,182 --> 01:38:43,618
I'm beyond you now.

1410
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:50,326
Tonight when I saw that I
didn't have that bloody keypad,

1411
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:51,826
you know, I was elated.

1412
01:38:51,893 --> 01:38:53,595
What I said at the station,
I meant every word.

1413
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:55,396
And that's why I came back.

1414
01:38:56,531 --> 01:38:58,099
I'm leaving you this.

1415
01:38:59,367 --> 01:39:01,169
You may well need it.

1416
01:39:01,236 --> 01:39:02,971
Where are you going?

1417
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:04,372
Home.

1418
01:39:28,897 --> 01:39:31,299
There are people outside
just waiting for me to call.

1419
01:39:31,367 --> 01:39:32,667
With this?

1420
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:35,770
- Help!
- Come here.

1421
01:39:35,837 --> 01:39:37,339
- Help! Help!
- Shut up.

1422
01:39:37,405 --> 01:39:38,673
Shut up.

1423
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:40,575
Help! Help!

1424
01:39:55,723 --> 01:39:56,791
Help!

1425
01:39:56,858 --> 01:39:58,259
- I said shut up!
- Help!

1426
01:39:58,327 --> 01:40:01,229
Help! Help! Help!

1427
01:40:02,931 --> 01:40:05,233
My God!

1428
01:40:28,089 --> 01:40:30,525
Well done, Betty.

1429
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:41,569
Are you going to give me
my money, Roy?

1430
01:40:43,271 --> 01:40:45,407
I don't have it.

1431
01:40:45,473 --> 01:40:50,412
I think you'll find he's got
exactly what you're owed.

1432
01:40:50,478 --> 01:40:53,147
And if he says otherwise,

1433
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:54,916
he's lying.

1434
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:05,159
Are you gonna hand it over?

1435
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:09,797
<i>Nein.</i>

1436
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:52,607
A person lives a long,
full life, with barely a scratch

1437
01:41:52,673 --> 01:41:56,544
just to get beaten by hooligans
and have himself a stroke.

1438
01:41:56,611 --> 01:41:58,713
It makes you almost
doubt the world.

1439
01:42:02,784 --> 01:42:06,788
The generation
that won the war.

1440
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:10,324
He can't talk or move much,
but he can hear you.

1441
01:42:12,428 --> 01:42:13,895
Hello, Roy.

1442
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:16,597
You can hear fine,
can't you, Roy?

1443
01:42:19,368 --> 01:42:20,601
You a relative?

1444
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:22,703
No.

1445
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:24,839
But I'll have to do.

1446
01:42:40,288 --> 01:42:41,589
Here.

1447
01:42:42,357 --> 01:42:44,326
Pretend it's champagne.

1448
01:43:16,624 --> 01:43:19,727
It is so good to see you back
in your natural surroundings.

1449
01:43:19,794 --> 01:43:21,195
Yes, you prefer tea
on the lawn

1450
01:43:21,262 --> 01:43:23,931
to a beer hall.
That's because you're English.

1451
01:43:28,337 --> 01:43:32,807
You know, any mistakes
that I made in Berlin...

1452
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:35,410
were because...

1453
01:43:37,379 --> 01:43:39,180
I'm so fond of you.

1454
01:43:41,450 --> 01:43:43,951
Hmm. "Fond."

1455
01:43:48,756 --> 01:43:50,691
Mwah.

1456
01:43:50,758 --> 01:43:54,228
- Here. Take this.
- Yes.

1457
01:43:56,264 --> 01:43:57,765
Off we go.

1458
01:43:59,767 --> 01:44:02,203
She's always been
that sort of person.

1459
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,838
Oh, I'll have one.

1460
01:44:03,905 --> 01:44:07,275
Now she's going to force me
to go outside.

1461
01:44:08,876 --> 01:44:10,978
Look what I've got.

1462
01:44:11,045 --> 01:44:12,813
Oh, yes, please. Lovely.

1463
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,182
You can have him back now.

1464
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:17,051
Aw, I was hoping
you'd keep him.

1465
01:44:17,118 --> 01:44:19,187
Shut up.

1466
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:21,255
Michael,
give your mum one first.

1467
01:44:21,322 --> 01:44:22,491
Okay, fine.

1468
01:44:22,558 --> 01:44:26,027
There you go, Mum, for you.
More champagne?

1469
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:27,362
Dad, you're all right?

1470
01:44:27,429 --> 01:44:28,530
Drink?

1471
01:44:48,749 --> 01:44:50,718
Be careful!

1472
01:44:54,755 --> 01:44:57,024
It's deeper than it looks.

1473
01:44:57,091 --> 01:44:59,328
It's all right, Gran.

1474
01:45:12,037 --> 01:45:17,037
