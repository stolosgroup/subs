2
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,420
So this Irish guy knocks on
this lady's door and says,

3
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,340
you know, "Have you
got any, uh... Any, uh...

4
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,541
work for me?"

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,180
And she says, "Um, well, you know,

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,747
as a matter of fact,
you could paint the porch."

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,669
But two hours later,
the guy comes back and says,

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,740
"I'm already finished, ma'am,

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,025
but just for your information,
it's not a Porsche, it's a BMW."

10
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,831
OK, asshole.

11
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,987
Giddyap.

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,740
The female lemur is a better jumper

13
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,060
and more efficient forager
than her male counterpart.

14
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,150
She has dominance over the male...

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,020
Oh, my God... feel this.

16
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,580
Baby's kicking. Feel.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,020
Touch it. No, not my boob.

18
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,220
Here.

19
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,468
Sorry we woke you up.

20
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,828
It was him, this asshole.

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,951
- What's this?
- I'm a little tight right now.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,300
My shit is not layaway.
I'm not JCPenney.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,020
You know I'm good for it.

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,702
I don't make like before, Vin.
Only a few freaks like the belly.

25
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,066
I have to save for maternity leave.

26
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,504
Hey, I like the belly, OK?

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,180
I'll see you next Tuesday.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,826
Extra when you do, OK? Double.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,940
This one here says the line is frozen.

30
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,180
Yes, with these reverse mortgages,
you can only borrow a percentage

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,260
of the equity you have in the house.
That's called the loan-to-value.

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,300
But now, since you've been
getting monthly payments from us

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,180
for the last... eight years,

34
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,900
you've reached the cash-out limit.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,580
That's that loan-to-value thing
I just mentioned.

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,220
- The house is worth...
- It was worth.

37
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,661
Whatever it was worth.

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,747
I need that money.

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,060
I'm sorry, Mr. MacKenna,
but there's really nothing I can do.

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,980
- It is what it is.
- "It is what it is"?

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,860
Everyone's saying that now.
You know what it means?

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,224
"You're screwed,
and you shall remain screwed."

43
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,060
I want to close this account.

44
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,580
I'm so sorry to hear that, sir.
May I ask why?

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,740
Lady, you're just a spoke on a wheel,

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,540
trying to make a living
like the rest of us schmucks.

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,820
I do not want to tell you
to go fuck yourself, so let's...

48
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,340
I'm closing it, OK?
Let's just leave it at that, please.

49
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,144
OK.

50
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,425
$112.14.

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,140
- All right, small bills.
- No, sir.

52
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,500
You're overdrawn that much.

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,020
What does that mean?

54
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,420
You took out more money
than you actually have in your account.

55
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,860
Here's zero. You went below zero.

56
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,220
So I... can't close this account?

57
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,700
You can.

58
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,584
Once you get it back to zero.

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,064
Hey, you taking care of yourself, Vin?

60
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,471
Yeah, blurry eyes.

61
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,540
I'm doing aerobics, can't you tell?

62
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,780
I'm doing the Jane Fonda workout.

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,940
A one, two, three, and stretch.

64
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,420
Janie's still looking good.

65
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,140
Roger, is there any chance
you could ever make one of these

66
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,980
that's strong enough for someone
that's not... your sister?

67
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,860
Why don't we give it a break
for a minute.

68
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,180
- Give what a break?
- The liquor.

69
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,420
You're not gonna serve me?

70
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,140
Don't be like that.

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,860
I'm watching out for you here.

72
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,860
You watching out for me?

73
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,100
You serve poison all day to all these
people that don't know no better.

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,540
So they can die while they're living.

75
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,140
And you're watching out for me.
You phony.

76
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,264
Oh, Blanche, these are my friends,
Rose and Dorothy.

77
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,020
Come here.

78
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,820
Shut up!

79
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,226
People are sleeping!

80
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,261
Piss.

81
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,860
Hey! What's going on?

82
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,060
You habla English?

83
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,740
Yes, we speak English, señor.

84
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,102
Then what the hell are you doing here?

85
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,150
That's my tree you assholes hit.

86
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,750
And my fence.

87
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,587
And my damn car.

88
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,180
Do you speak English?

89
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,906
- Stay here.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,020
I'm calling the cops.

91
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,580
- Is everybody OK?
- What do you want?

92
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,545
- I'm Maggie. I'm your new neighbor.
- So?

93
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,020
Well, we're moving in.

94
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,340
I can see that, yeah.
Are these dipshits with you?

95
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,386
Yes, they're the men I hired
from the moving company.

96
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,100
Oh, boy.

97
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,300
"Oh, boy"? No.
"Oh, shit" is more like it.

98
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,860
This fence is 20 years old.

99
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,780
The car's 30.

100
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,268
The tree is older than I am.

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,100
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what I'm...

102
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,380
This is not how I wanted
to meet, either.

103
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,780
- Did you do this?
- Of course they did it.

104
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,100
What are you, stupid?
Look at the crime scene.

105
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,060
OK, you don't have to be rude to me!
I'm just trying to move in here.

106
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,150
I hired these guys to do it.
And accidents happen.

107
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,340
Well, the car is an antique, missy.
I mean, it's worth a lot.

108
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,020
- Then I'll take care of it.
- You?

109
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,580
You don't got no money.

110
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,140
What? I mean, no offense, but you just
don't look like you do. OK?

111
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,468
And I'm sure Chico and the Man here
are off the books.

112
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,671
No, I will sue the moving company.

113
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,140
You can buck up for the fence
and the tree.

114
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,021
Fine.

115
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,460
Toodles.

116
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,020
Is that our new neighbor?

117
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,500
Yep.

118
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,240
It's gonna be a long life.

119
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,980
"'Well,' said the tree,

120
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,340
straightening herself up
as much as she could,

121
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,980
'An old stump is good
for sitting and resting.

122
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,700
Come, boy, sit down. Sit down and rest.'

123
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,940
And the boy did.
And the tree was happy."

124
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,460
God, that's depressing.

125
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,020
No, it's not.

126
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,380
The tree was meant to give,

127
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,340
so to be able to give everything
and have nothing left

128
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,269
is the best life
the tree could ever have.

129
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,300
Well, your father must think I'm a tree.

130
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,980
- Why would he think that?
- Nothing. Nothing.

131
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,580
It's good you think good things.
Come on.

132
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,066
Get in there.

133
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,580
All right, big day tomorrow.

134
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,380
Yeah, I know, first day.

135
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,980
Yeah, for me, too.

136
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,780
And I can't be late, all right?
It's just me and you now.

137
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,060
- I know.
- Set your alarm

138
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,469
and make sure I don't oversleep.
Good night.

139
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,380
All right. Here, I made you
peanut butter and banana.

140
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,580
- Thanks, Mom.
- OK.

141
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,340
Do you have your snack money
in your pocket?

142
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,260
- And your keys?
- Yep.

143
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,380
You got your phone? Map?

144
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,900
- Yep, on the phone.
- OK, what time do you get out?

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,660
- 2:45.
- All right, come straight home,

146
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,860
start your homework, and I'll be home
a couple hours after that.

147
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,340
Wait, Ma, you're not gonna
pick me up or anything?

148
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,147
I'm in the bus lane! I'm not gonna get
another ticket, Oliver! Bye, be good!

149
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,580
OK, settle down!

150
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,300
Settle down! Settle down!
Settle down! Settle down!

151
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,980
I know it's hard to contain yourselves
when you're so, so young

152
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,460
and full of sugar juice,

153
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,580
but we must concentrate on our studies
or we will what?

154
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,860
We will die dumb.

155
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,980
Yes, we will, and dumbness
does not play well in Heaven.

156
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,500
This is Oliver.

157
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,100
Oliver is joining us midstream
here at St. Patrick,

158
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,900
and we are very happy to have him,
are we not?

159
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,060
Welcome to St. Patrick, Oliver.

160
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,660
Such genuine caring. Thank you.

161
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,860
I think you feel touched? Right?
You feel touched by that?

162
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,906
Maybe as a thank you,
you can lead us all in morning prayer.

163
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,700
I think... I think I'm Jewish.

164
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,100
OK.

165
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,950
Good to know.

166
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,660
Oliver thinks he's Jewish.

167
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,500
- So am I.
- I'm Buddhist.

168
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,740
There is no God.

169
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,940
Yes. You get the idea.

170
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,060
We celebrate all the religions
of the world in this room, Oliver.

171
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,220
I'm a Catholic, which is the best
of all the religions, really,

172
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,100
because we have the most rules

173
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,700
and the best clothes,

174
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,820
but among us there is also
a Buddhist, agnostic.

175
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,620
We have a Baptist,
and we have an "I don't know,"

176
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,340
which seems to be the fastest
growing religion in the world.

177
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,460
And now we have "I think I'm Jewish,"

178
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,980
which is a new one for the class,
Oliver, so thanks for that,

179
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,020
but it does not preclude you
from giving us a morning prayer.

180
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,746
Let us bow our heads and pray.

181
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,425
Dear...

182
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,106
God, et cetera.

183
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,909
Dear... Dear God... thank you?

184
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,260
- Amen.
- Amen.

185
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,740
- Amen! Amen, thanks be to God.
- Amen.

186
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,940
All right, stirring stuff.

187
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,380
Well done, Oliver.
Go grab yourself a seat.

188
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,380
And everybody else
dust off those textbooks

189
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,100
and go to chapter 12.

190
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,668
That's chapter 12, Catholic saints.

191
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,264
All right, I'm here.

192
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,102
I'm here. I'm ready. I'm able.

193
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,787
Let's get this. Come on.

194
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,300
Look at that, it's Ground Pepper
sprinting ahead on the inside!

195
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,220
Come on, dig in.

196
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,785
Come on.

197
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,381
Come on!

198
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,781
One time!

199
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,070
One damn time!

200
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,308
You son of a bitch!

201
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,100
I don't know why you get
so pissy, Vinny.

202
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,791
You always lose. It seems like
you'd be comfortable by now.

203
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,510
Yeah, tough day.

204
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,231
Help yourself.

205
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,940
I'm thirsty. And you owe me money, Vin.

206
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,180
I got a situation I'm working out.

207
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,940
You know, I'm not
the sole proprietor here.

208
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,660
I've got other people to answer to.

209
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,620
I just need a little time, that's all.

210
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,185
So what do I tell them?

211
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,381
A month.

212
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,590
We'll split the difference.

213
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,021
Make it two weeks.

214
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,024
Watch out!

215
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,383
All right, how many?

216
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,340
And time!

217
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,940
You can let go now.

218
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,540
Did they have physical education
in the last school you went to?

219
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,020
- Yes.
- Did you take it?

220
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,745
Yes, sir.

221
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,140
Look who it is. There's the strong man.

222
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,620
"I think I'm Jewish."

223
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,151
My name's Oliver, by the way.

224
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,860
"My name's Oliver."

225
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,540
You little turd.

226
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,700
- Where'd you come from, anyway?
- Hello.

227
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,500
Did you guys hear the bell?

228
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,540
That means to move, go to class.

229
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,424
Come on, let's go.

230
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,187
Can't even do a sit-up.

231
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,620
- Do you need a map?
- No, sir.

232
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,630
Well, you better double-time it,
or you're gonna be late. Let's go.

233
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,585
Shit.

234
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,261
Who took his clothes?

235
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,981
Nice shorts.

236
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,830
Sir?

237
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,820
Take me, God. Don't play with me.

238
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,351
It's me, sir.

239
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,900
Yeah, what?

240
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,940
I was wondering
if I could use your phone?

241
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,142
- My phone?
- Yes.

242
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,100
- In my house?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,500
I need to call my mom.
I'm locked out of the house,

244
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,540
'cause these guys in gym class
took my keys and my phone

245
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,580
and I can't get in.
And they also took my wallet.

246
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,300
I don't need to hear
the whole story, OK?

247
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,104
One call.

248
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,140
Hi. It's Maggie.
Can't take your call right now.

249
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,220
Please leave a message.

250
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,700
Oh, hey, Mom. I, lost my keys
for the house and my wallet

251
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,860
and my phone, and I'm at the...

252
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,260
old guy's next-door.

253
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,300
Sir, what's your name?

254
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,061
- Vincent, the old guy.
- Vincent, the old guy.

255
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,303
The mean one.

256
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,180
What's your name?

257
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,269
It's Oliver, sir.

258
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,180
They let you wear
those shorts to school?

259
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,620
Well, it's a long story, sir.

260
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,822
I'm sure it is.

261
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,580
Yeah?

262
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,380
Hi. This is Maggie, Oliver's mom.

263
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,180
Your kid's here.

264
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,460
Yeah, I know. I got his message.
I hope that's all right.

265
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,980
Is what all right?

266
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,980
- That he stays there.
- Stays here?

267
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,500
- Like what, stays here?
- I'm at work.

268
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,220
I've got three or four more cases, and
I'm not gonna be home for a few hours,

269
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,260
so I'm kind of in a jam here.

270
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,020
You want me to babysit?

271
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,660
Well, it's not...
It's not like he's a baby.

272
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,500
I mean, he's just probably gonna
sit quietly and do his homework.

273
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,260
He's... he's really easy.

274
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,746
Sir, is that...

275
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,980
- How much you paying?
- What?

276
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,340
You want me to babysit.

277
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,620
I'm not a philanthropy.

278
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,630
- I don't... Ten dollars an hour?
- Twelve.

279
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,660
OK, $12 an hour. Can I talk to him?

280
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,589
It's for you.

281
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,300
...I said, sit up!

282
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,945
Up!

283
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,300
He doesn't like many people.

284
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,540
I'm good with animals, sir.

285
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,903
Yeah. He doesn't usually like people
who say they're good with animals.

286
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,060
OK, pal...

287
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,020
You never seen Abbott and Costello?

288
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,940
No, sir. Are they old?

289
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,260
No.

290
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,100
They're dead.

291
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,620
That's the oldest you can be.

292
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,948
Or the youngest.
Time freezes when you're dead.

293
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,900
Where'd you learn that?

294
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,180
A book.

295
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,740
What book?

296
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,023
A kids book, sir. I doubt you'd know it.

297
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,301
It's dinnertime.

298
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,300
- You hungry or something?
- A little, sir.

299
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,380
That figures.

300
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,104
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

301
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,101
You're getting sushi.

302
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,025
You see, your troubles are all over.

303
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,580
That's probably your mother.

304
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,460
Probably, sir.

305
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,669
- Don't get up.
- OK.

306
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,225
Hi. I...

307
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,700
- Hi. Vincent?
- Yep.

308
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,900
Maggie. I...

309
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,900
Thank you for watching him.

310
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,260
You know, with the new job and...
my boss, you know...

311
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,827
- I don't need to hear the whole story.
- OK.

312
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,540
Oh...

313
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,901
Here.

314
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,540
What'd we say? Was that...

315
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,260
...that three hours at... at $12...

316
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,827
- $36.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

317
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,105
- I've got two twenties.
- I don't have change.

318
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,540
That's fine.

319
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,060
How come you don't have anyone
to watch this kid after school?

320
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,220
We just moved in.

321
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,620
Where's the father?

322
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,020
We met in college,
and it turns out that...

323
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,300
- he had been seeing someone...
- Don't need to tell it, then.

324
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,100
You gonna pay for my fence?

325
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,700
Yeah, I... yes,

326
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,900
- I said I was going to.
- And my tree?

327
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,183
I'm not sure how...
I can pay for a branch.

328
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,627
Everything has a price.
You're an adult, you should know that.

329
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,500
All right. Let me know.

330
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,220
I can watch the kid after school,
a few hours.

331
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:37,660
Same price.

332
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,181
I can do $11 an hour,
you pay the snacks.

333
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,906
Your kid ate my last can of sardines.

334
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,541
Really?

335
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,223
- Smell his breath.
- They have those options...

336
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,220
I thought you ate at Vincent's house.

337
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,500
We had sushi.

338
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,860
You had sushi?

339
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,020
Well, sardines. He calls it sushi.
Didn't want to hurt his feelings.

340
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,506
So, you like him?

341
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,625
Well, he's interesting.

342
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,540
Sort of cool, in a grouchy sort of way.

343
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,629
Yeah, I'll bet he is.

344
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,260
He has a cool cat, though, Felix.

345
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,100
You know, he...

346
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,380
offered to watch you after school.

347
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,947
- He did?
- That's a horrible idea, right?

348
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,660
Well...

349
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,460
he lives right next door.
You can't get closer than that.

350
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,140
Yeah, I had thought about that.

351
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,390
You know, it would save me
from having to find a babysitter.

352
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,780
You'll be home, though, right?

353
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,940
Yeah, I'm gonna come home,
but sometimes late.

354
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,260
You know, I'm the one that has to work
now. Your father's not helping.

355
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,740
I don't know if he ever is going to.
And your school's not exactly cheap.

356
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,500
I guess he's too old to be dangerous,

357
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,820
and not too old to be
too dangerous, either.

358
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,704
If you know what I mean.

359
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,700
Stupid place.

360
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,743
Who pissed in your Cheerios?

361
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,260
I can't dance no more.

362
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,740
Oh, that's a surprise.

363
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,669
We need the money, Vin!

364
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,180
The quality of mercy
is suddenly strained.

365
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,700
I should sue these assholes!

366
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,180
What's the word?

367
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,620
Discrimination against
pregnant woman! Yes?

368
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,580
I think you got a real good case.

369
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,420
This stupid bump
is costing me much money.

370
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,220
Well, he's gonna cost you
a lot more pretty soon.

371
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,980
It's not "he."

372
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,380
it's a she?

373
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,420
How I know this?

374
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,180
I look like psychic to you?

375
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,780
No, you don't. But they have technology.

376
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,220
Yeah, I know what they have.

377
00:26:58,503 --> 00:27:00,300
Well, maybe I call stripper employer

378
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,940
and ask them to fax insurance card
to pay ultrasound.

379
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,260
Yes?

380
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,827
So, the question I suppose is...

381
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,140
what is a saint? What is a saint?

382
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,980
Does anybody know what a saint is?

383
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,740
I don't think they do. Ooh, Rachel.

384
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,620
Individuals who display and act
out of exceptional holiness.

385
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,580
That's pretty perfect.
Thank you, Rachel.

386
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,380
Who can name a saint?

387
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,220
- Jeremiah.
- Saint Jude?

388
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,500
Saint Jude, yes.
And what is Saint Jude known for?

389
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,380
I think he owns a hospital, right?

390
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,380
And a golf tournament, right?
That's what... Yeah, OK.

391
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,980
Anyone know any modern-day saints?

392
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,300
Bridgette.

393
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,340
- Mother Teresa.
- Mother Teresa, yes.

394
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,220
The big MT is a modern-day saint.

395
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,940
So, a saint is a human being

396
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,340
we celebrate for their commitment
and dedication

397
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,020
to other human beings,

398
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,980
for the sacrifices that they make,
for their hard work

399
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,500
in making the world a better place
for those around us

400
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,180
and for those who will follow them.

401
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,021
Good night.

402
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,940
- Maggie Bronstein?
- Hi.

403
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,420
Robin called in sick.
Got six cases backed up.

404
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,740
Yeah, I have to go
pick up my son, though, so...

405
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,460
Sorry, can't let you clock out
without the shift being covered.

406
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,741
Hospital policy.

407
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,981
Oh...

408
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,706
Come on, coward,
try to sell me something.

409
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,500
Yeah?

410
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,820
- Vincent?
- You evil witch.

411
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,940
I'm gonna listen to your whole
goddamn spiel,

412
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,500
and then I'm gonna hang up.

413
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,860
- Vincent, it's Maggie.
- Maggie? That's a good one.

414
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,620
Wait, is it Maggie from Calcutta,
or is it Maggie from New Delhi?

415
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,780
No, it's your neighbor, Maggie.

416
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,221
What the hell do you want?

417
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,466
Let's go!

418
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,582
You better buckle up.

419
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,340
You're not buckled.

420
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,588
My life is my problem.

421
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,542
- This the way home?
- No.

422
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,260
Hey, let's lay down some S.O. P.

423
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,580
I don't know what S.O.P. means, sir.

424
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,820
Standard operating procedure.

425
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,060
You go where I go, you do what I say,

426
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,380
get your homework done somewhere
along the way, but most importantly,

427
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,420
you don't annoy me.

428
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,100
I am not happy when I'm annoyed.

429
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,507
Are you annoyed right now?

430
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,023
Not particularly.

431
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,507
Really?

432
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,460
Here's a dime.

433
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,061
Call your mom,
tell her you're wearing your seat belt.

434
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,380
It costs more than a dime.

435
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,020
Since when?

436
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,984
Since before I was born.

437
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,940
What is this country coming to?

438
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,585
Right here.

439
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,549
If it costs more than that,
call collect.

440
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,620
- Hey, look. It's dipshit.
- You live in this neighborhood?

441
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,180
I probably got detention
'cause of you, asshole.

442
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,060
You got detention
'cause you took my stuff.

443
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,150
How do you know I took it, you narc?

444
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,426
Oh, yeah!

445
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,026
He just slapped you!

446
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,620
Stop!

447
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,025
You got him.

448
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,380
Listen, the next time the teachers
ask you what happened,

449
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,940
you don't say anything! You got me?

450
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,420
- Get off me!
- No! I don't care!

451
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,980
So you can go crying
to your mommy! Cry...

452
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,340
What are you little shit heels doing?

453
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,060
Is that you, Robert Ocinski?

454
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,060
No, sir. My name's John.

455
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,700
Bullshit, you little prick.

456
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,020
You're Briana's kid.

457
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,020
Only Puerto Rican Polack in Brooklyn.

458
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,100
Well, I got a deal
for you little bully shit heels.

459
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,860
Whatever you do to this guy here,

460
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,820
I'm gonna do to your mothers.

461
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,500
You understand? And in the meantime...

462
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,220
ride this.

463
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,180
- What the...
- Run!

464
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,900
- Come on, let's get out, man!
- Run, you little...

465
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,060
Get out of here!

466
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,780
Get moving, you little shits!

467
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,267
Let's get out of here!
The old man's crazy!

468
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,545
What, you waiting
for a paper invitation?

469
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,500
Who taught you to slap?

470
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,700
I don't know, sir.
Just an instinct, I guess.

471
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,426
Yeah, well, you need to unlearn that.

472
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,820
I'm allergic, sir.

473
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,704
To what?

474
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,703
Cigarette smoke.

475
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,860
Your father never taught you
to defend yourself?

476
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,940
No, sir. He's a pacifist.

477
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,340
Well, this country wasn't founded by
tree huggers, that's for sure.

478
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,940
No, you need to defend yourself,
or you get mowed down.

479
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,300
I'm small, if you haven't noticed.

480
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,780
- Yeah, so was Hitler.
- That's a horrible comparison.

481
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,380
Indeed. Making a point, though.

482
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,581
Small means nothing.

483
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,906
It's what's in here.

484
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,665
Or here, sir.

485
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,020
OK, powerhouse.

486
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,461
Grab the basket.

487
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,707
- Hey.
- Hey, Vin.

488
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,420
This place is like a mansion.

489
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,220
OK, when we get in there, no talking.

490
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,220
Where are we going?

491
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,391
You know, this is a great chance
for you to practice no talking.

492
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,429
Come on.

493
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,740
Sorry I'm late.

494
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,820
There you are, Doctor.

495
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,500
Nice to see you, Sandy.

496
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,100
How you feeling?

497
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,060
Today is my birthday.

498
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,460
OK.

499
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,460
Happy birthday.

500
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,503
What are you, 17?

501
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,228
Oh, will you put those things
in those drawers?

502
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,862
All right, Sandy.

503
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,591
Let's see how the old ticker's working.

504
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,740
Can you... tell them I don't like...

505
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,300
the green beans

506
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,100
when they put the bacon bits

507
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,711
chopped up in there with them?

508
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,110
It's too greasy for me.

509
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,665
Will do, Sandy.

510
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,228
Well, as near as I can tell...

511
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,983
you're still beautiful.

512
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,747
Perhaps you require a second opinion
from my associate.

513
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,231
Beautiful.

514
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,500
You know, we can do
the laundry here, Vin.

515
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,380
- We have a service.
- Thanks.

516
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,060
It gives me something to do.

517
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,180
Who's your helper?

518
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,620
He's 11 bucks an hour.

519
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,820
It's Oliver, actually.

520
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,740
Nice to meet you, Oliver. I'm Ana.

521
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

522
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,500
OK, thanks.

523
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,700
OK.

524
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,220
Oh, wait.

525
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,380
She don't like the string beans.

526
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,700
- I'll make a note. What's she prefer?
- Broccoli.

527
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,020
Broccoli's good.

528
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,224
- OK, thanks.
- Take care, Vin.

529
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,749
And time.

530
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,620
OK. Well, that's just gonna
get you beat up pretty bad.

531
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,540
I don't want to fight, anyway.

532
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,940
Well, nobody wants to fight. You know?
You think I wanted to go to war?

533
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,740
You think an 18-year-old kid wants
to sit in a rice paddy

534
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,380
- with bullets whizzing by his head?
- When was that?

535
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,420
- Vietnam.
- You were there?

536
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,060
I think I'm imagining it.

537
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,940
All right, I'm gonna show you one thing,
and it's probably your best shot.

538
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,420
If you do it right,
you can break the guy's nose.

539
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,180
- Break his nose?
- Relax. You're not gonna get it right.

540
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,940
All right. OK.

541
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,780
He's bigger than you,
so you get down below him like this,

542
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,460
you squat like this...

543
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,100
just crouch...

544
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,100
and you stand up real hard,

545
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,500
and you push all the way
through your legs,

546
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,340
all the way up, your shoulders,
your butt, everything pushes up,

547
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,340
and you push all the way up through that
arm and go whack, right in the snoot.

548
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,063
Right? Try it on me. Ready?

549
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,463
OK, but you got to do it
faster than that, right?

550
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,860
OK. All right, now...

551
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,380
Maggie Bronstein?

552
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,460
- I have Mace!
- OK.

553
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,140
I've got papers.
Kings County Family Court.

554
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,263
As they say, you've been served.

555
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,420
Yeah, I know you worked
some extra hours, so...

556
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,622
I'm gonna cover it.

557
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,785
I wasn't offering a discount.

558
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,820
So, what have you been crying about?

559
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,340
- It's a long story.
- OK.

560
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,271
What's the punch line?

561
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,145
My ex wants custody.

562
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,941
There goes my job security.

563
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,827
Thanks, you asshole.

564
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,660
That could've gone either way.

565
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,740
It's gonna be cold for a second, OK?

566
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,625
See there? That's the baby's head.

567
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,060
This is very big head.

568
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,220
Maybe good, no?

569
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,580
It's the biggest part at this age.

570
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,466
And these... are her little legs.

571
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,100
She?

572
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,540
You didn't know?

573
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,663
Sorry. Did you not want to know?

574
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,541
No. It's good to know.

575
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,300
I couldn't verify with your insurance,
Mr. MacKenna.

576
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,100
We are just married.

577
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,860
- That happened.
- Really?

578
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,620
Yeah, I told insurance.
You know how slow they are.

579
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,300
I mean, the bureaucracy
and the paperwork.

580
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,709
I mean, what is a co-pay running,
anyway?

581
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,987
Twenty dollars.

582
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,100
This is good price, no?

583
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,740
For you, only the best.

584
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,940
You're worth it.

585
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,580
Thank you, sugarplum.

586
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,860
You owe me, lady.

587
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,471
Here.

588
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,907
- See you later.
- OK. Take care of yourselves.

589
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,140
Hey!

590
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,100
- Hi, Ma.
- What are you doing?

591
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,380
I'm mowing Vin's lawn.

592
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,151
Well... Hey, Vin!

593
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,660
I was sleeping. Thanks for that.

594
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,180
Why is he mowing your dirt patch?

595
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,940
Oh, yeah, he's paying me hourly.

596
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,260
I'm showing him how the world works.

597
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,940
You work, you get paid, you drink.

598
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,029
Are you drinking alcohol?

599
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,380
I honestly don't remember.

600
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,900
All right, let's go.
I'm gonna make dinner.

601
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,980
- You can do homework.
- I already ate.

602
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,420
Stop mow... You're mowing dirt.
Let's go.

603
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,700
He's fed, the homework's checked,
I've done my job, I'm taking a break.

604
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,020
- Payday tomorrow.
- OK. Come on, let's... Leave it.

605
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,710
There's no grass.

606
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,690
Bye, Vin.

607
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,911
Come on, come on.

608
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,020
- You're out!
- Good luck.

609
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,780
Get ready for a red ass,
you little shit bag.

610
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,108
- All right, we got him.
- Come on, come on.

611
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,122
Missed it!

612
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,265
Say your prayers, you little pussy.

613
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,340
- What happened? What happened here?
- I don't know.

614
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,780
- You don't know?
- It's not my fault.

615
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,186
Let me see.

616
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,940
You asshole, dick bag, son of a whore!

617
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,141
Whoa! Bronstein!

618
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,420
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

619
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,460
I am Daka.

620
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,060
Who are you?

621
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,389
- I'm Oliver.
- Oliver.

622
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,260
Why you bang this door so much?

623
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,940
He's hard of hearing!

624
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,580
Let him in!

625
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,703
Don't yell at me!

626
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,300
You broke his nose?

627
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,460
Yes, sir, I think so.
There was blood everywhere.

628
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,100
- You should've seen it.
- I wish I had.

629
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,060
You must have got him
just right. Show me.

630
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,261
OK.

631
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,627
Ha-yah!

632
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,500
You teach him fighting?

633
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,980
He's a little runt, you know?

634
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,148
He's got to learn how to defend himself.

635
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,304
Fighting is for assholes.

636
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,908
Where's my money?

637
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,260
It's on the dresser.

638
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,300
Minus the co-pay.

639
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,580
You don't teach children.

640
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,781
Yah!

641
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,107
Look at you.

642
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,623
Breaking his nose!

643
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,342
Who is she?

644
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,780
A lady of the night.

645
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,940
What's that?

646
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,500
It's one of the more honest ways
to make a living.

647
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,340
The board tells you
the action for the day,

648
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,540
race number, who's running,

649
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,660
who's riding, and so forth.

650
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,380
What's 20-slash-one?

651
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,980
That's odds.

652
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,660
Some bookie out of Vegas thinks

653
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,100
that that horse has
a one-in-20 chance of winning.

654
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,500
What do you get if he does?

655
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,980
20 times your money.

656
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,380
That's a good deal.

657
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,389
If you win, sure.

658
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,900
That one with the wraps is a dog.

659
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,740
Doesn't sound like a compliment.

660
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,420
Not for a horse. No, the odds
of him winning are astronomical.

661
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,220
Long odds, bigger payout.

662
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,787
We should take him across the board.

663
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,986
Well, don't get ahead of yourself, kid.

664
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,220
- Are you praying?
- Praying?

665
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,500
That's what it looks like.

666
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,580
I thought we talked about
you not talking.

667
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,589
What's a trifecta?

668
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,660
You pick, three horses: one, two, three,

669
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,420
in the order they finish,
and it's a high risk, high reward.

670
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,985
Sounds improbable.

671
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,066
Well, if you're gonna gamble, you might
as well have a chance to win big.

672
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,660
Harvey Knows Best, Sweeter Lady,

673
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,460
Champagne Flute.

674
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,300
One, two, three.

675
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,100
800-to-1.

676
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,020
You got any money?

677
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,346
Sure.

678
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,380
- Seven dollars.
- What is that, lunch money?

679
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,740
Yes, sir.

680
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,022
Well, you might as well
learn the hard way.

681
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,705
I'll throw in some, too.
That's called mitigation.

682
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,220
What's... mitigation?

683
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,549
That's where you throw in seven
and I throw in three.

684
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,860
And they're off!

685
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,060
Sweeter Lady takes the lead
by a length and a half...

686
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,300
Come on. Come on.

687
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,070
...and here comes Harvey Knows Best!

688
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,220
Harvey Knows Best making a final surge
as they come around for the line!

689
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,581
This is ridiculous!

690
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,060
This is really happening! Don't stop!

691
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,100
Don't stop!

692
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,500
Don't stop! Don't stop!

693
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,940
This is ridiculous!

694
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,380
- Yeah! Yeah!
- This is ridiculous!

695
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,060
- Go! Go!
- Yeah!

696
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,820
Don't stop! Just hang on, please!

697
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,683
And it will be Harvey Knows Best

698
00:46:30,783 --> 00:46:33,780
followed by Sweeter Lady
and Champagne Flute.

699
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,260
- This isn't fair! It's not fair!
- We won, didn't we?

700
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,340
Just roll with this,
just roll with this, man.

701
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,540
Just roll with this,
and act like you didn't win it.

702
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,380
- Shit!
- No, no, it didn't work for us.

703
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,940
Do you understand me?

704
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,580
It didn't happen. We didn't win at all.

705
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,460
We didn't win anything, OK?

706
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,181
Thank you.

707
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,220
Good afternoon... Mr. MacKenna.

708
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,660
I need to open up
a savings account for my grandson.

709
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,780
Oh...

710
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,740
And this'll get my account up to zero.

711
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,147
Close me out
while you're tapping away over there.

712
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,540
Don't ever become a pencil pusher, kid.

713
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,708
They're spineless.

714
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,940
Hello, Mrs. Bronstein.

715
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,907
This is Dan O'Brien,
principal here at St. Patrick.

716
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,780
A few days ago, your son, Oliver,
was involved in a fight at school.

717
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,500
- We've tried to reach you...
- What?

718
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,220
If you're a telemarketer,

719
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,060
please leave a message
so I can not return your call.

720
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,140
Vin.

721
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,263
Vin? Oliver?

722
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,188
Oliver, it's Mom. Pick up.

723
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,670
Hello?

724
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,703
You want another?

725
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,540
Yes, please.

726
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,788
Go for it. We're living today.

727
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,940
Excuse me, sir?

728
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,661
You kids. Damn small talkers.

729
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,020
There's no point in yapping
if no one's listening.

730
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,700
- Let's hear it.
- Excuse me, sir!

731
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,380
You can't get nothing in this world
without being heard.

732
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,940
Another Coke, please.

733
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,540
And you can hit me, too, Rog.

734
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,180
We're out of your bourbon.

735
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,030
You cleaned me out.

736
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,660
Rog... don't lie to me. Be a man.

737
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,860
Vin. And he's not supposed
to be sitting at the bar.

738
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,980
You're right. We're gonna go
somewhere else to spend our money.

739
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,900
Hey, he's only doing his job there, Vin.

740
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,020
Be nice.

741
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,380
Oh!

742
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,786
Damn!

743
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,900
- Amber, get the first-aid kit.
- OK.

744
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,220
But it's just a cut. I got lots of 'em.

745
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,620
Here, here.

746
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,180
Man, you're bleeding all over the bar.

747
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,860
That's fine. Kid's got to do homework.

748
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,346
Come on, let's go.

749
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,140
- Hi, Mom.
- Where were you?

750
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,860
Where the hell is your car, Vin?

751
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,860
- It broke down.
- Broke down.

752
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,903
Oh, it broke down? Really?

753
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,942
I don't appreciate you
taking him anywhere without asking me.

754
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,900
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

755
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,140
Could you not be a smart-ass,
just for once? OK?

756
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,540
I want to know where my son is
at all times, OK?

757
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,180
- We just went to... eat.
- He should starve?

758
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,860
Go in the house, Oliver.

759
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,740
- Mom...
- Go in the house, Oliver.

760
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,540
Good night, Vin.

761
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,742
Yeah, we'll see about that.

762
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,420
You know, he's getting in fights
at school. Did you know that?

763
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,060
Yeah, he mentioned something like that.

764
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,100
Yeah? Well, he didn't mention
anything to me about it.

765
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,900
Oh, well, maybe you haven't noticed,
but you haven't been home much.

766
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,980
It's difficult to have a conversation
with someone that's not here.

767
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,341
Oh, we're gonna do that?

768
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,980
God, I love when somebody like you
tells somebody like me advice,

769
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,180
especially on parenting.

770
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,940
I didn't sign on for the hormones,
dearie,

771
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,260
so that's gonna cost you
15 bucks an hour.

772
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,980
You know why you never had kids?

773
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,540
Because you don't want to think
about anybody other than yourself.

774
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,630
What do you know about me, really?

775
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,190
Tell me. I'd love it.

776
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,140
Nothing. I don't know a thing about you,
just the way you want it.

777
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,150
Then you can act like a prick
and it keeps everybody away.

778
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,980
If it ain't broken...

779
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,180
it is broken, Vin. Take a look at it.

780
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,660
All right, I'm at 40 hours
for this week.

781
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,147
At 41, I go to time and a half.

782
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,308
Excuse me, is someone gonna pay me?

783
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,984
You've got to be kidding me.

784
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,100
I can't even say these words.

785
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,745
They're creative.

786
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,380
- Yes.
- That's one way to put it.

787
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,940
Well... adjusting to a new school

788
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,980
- is tough on children at this age.
- Yep.

789
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,380
At any age, really,
and I don't want to minimize that.

790
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,340
But is there anything else going on
that we should be aware of?

791
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,220
Oh, I wouldn't even know where to start.

792
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,340
- How about his father?
- Well,

793
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,860
I don't want to take up all your time.

794
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,869
We have loads of time.

795
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,420
We're in the middle of a divorce.

796
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,940
Oliver's father was having
an affair with his assistant,

797
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,580
and our accountant,

798
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,100
and my hairdresser,
while she was still doing my hair,

799
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,820
so that was fun.

800
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,260
And now he's filed for custody
of Oliver,

801
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,180
full custody.

802
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,740
And he won't pay any support
until he gets what he wants.

803
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,980
- Plus, he's a lawyer.
- Shit.

804
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,900
So I just had to get out of there
as fast as I could,

805
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,420
and I took Oliver with me,

806
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,100
and I got a job at Mission Hills.

807
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,060
I'm a CAT scan tech.

808
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,620
So I just see...
really rough stuff all day.

809
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,060
You know, cancer and tumors

810
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,380
and cysts and clots,
and I see what I'm looking at,

811
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,900
but I can't tell, you know, the people

812
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,420
that are laying there,
so that's... miserable all day.

813
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,780
And I work really late,

814
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,668
because I'm trying
to get our act together.

815
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,940
That's why he's here,
so he can have a good education,

816
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,060
and I'm trying to just give him
a semi-normal life,

817
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,980
and I'm dealing with this shit
from David and... custody.

818
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,182
I'm sorry about swearing.

819
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,940
I know he didn't even want kids.

820
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,220
He didn't want them.

821
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,740
He's just doing this so I'm not happy.

822
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,700
You know Oliver's adopted.

823
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,500
- Did you know that?
- I didn't.

824
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,980
I don't know how you would, but he is.

825
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:27,220
And... I cannot have... kids.

826
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,060
You know, something about
my fallopian tubes being twisted.

827
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,500
I think, what I really think,

828
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,909
is that they were just recoiling
from David's sperm.

829
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,860
Can I... Can I just have one?

830
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,740
Thank you. Thank you for that.

831
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:47,300
So I just think that all of this
has kind of permeated, you know,

832
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,820
Oliver's whole little being, right?

833
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,820
I mean, it has to.

834
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,180
He's like a little,
like a little sponge.

835
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,740
My real name's Robert.

836
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,180
Ocinski's my last name.

837
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,900
People call me that ever since Geraghty
called me that last year.

838
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,820
Now everyone calls me that.

839
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,380
It's not like I can
go around and tell them,

840
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,580
"Hey, dickwad, don't call me Ocinski.

841
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,500
My name's Robert."

842
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,340
'Cause I would spend
my whole life doing that.

843
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,140
You taking a wiz?

844
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,183
Sorry, can't hold it.

845
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,260
Robert was my dad's name.

846
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,540
So I'm a junior.

847
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,020
He's not around, though.

848
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,064
I don't really know him,
'cause he left when I was a baby.

849
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,460
Yeah, my dad's not around, either.

850
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,700
He did some bad things to my mom,
so we left him.

851
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,141
Haven't seen him in a while.

852
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,187
I kind of miss him, though.
My mom's being a jerk.

853
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,461
They do that, man.

854
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,620
Hey, your dad the one
that taught you how to fight?

855
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,788
No, my babysitter.

856
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,345
Tide comes in twice a day, Doctor.

857
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,109
Yeah, that's the tide, comes and goes.

858
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,740
I can't wait for autumn.

859
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,260
They plant the most beautiful mums
all around the water.

860
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,380
- Yeah?
- Every color you can imagine.

861
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,708
I don't know where they get them all.

862
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,664
At the garden store.

863
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,907
You've always been so funny, Vin.

864
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,980
Vin?

865
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,547
Vin, it's Vin, Sandy.

866
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,707
The ducks eat them, though.

867
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,460
We have to shoo them away.

868
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,105
It's such a shame.

869
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,988
It's a shame.

870
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,260
There's plenty of affordable
health care options, Vin.

871
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,100
I'm sure you know that.

872
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,340
Sunnyside is pricey.

873
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,941
Not for everyone.

874
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,620
Well, my Sandy gets the best.

875
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,100
I just, I'll just have to figure it out.

876
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,060
I understand that,
but you're months behind,

877
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,140
and we are not in the credit business,
as you know.

878
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,820
- What's that mean?
- We need payment in full

879
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,460
and three months in advance.

880
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,820
Got it.

881
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,060
By next week.

882
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,866
- Next week?
- Yeah, next week.

883
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,991
Well, I can give you 20 percent...

884
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,141
- ...in good faith?
- Vin, we're past good faith. I'm sorry.

885
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,500
We will transfer Sandy
wherever you want to put her.

886
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,420
Put her?

887
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,146
That's it or we get the boot?

888
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,020
I don't think that's the best way
to phrase what's happening.

889
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,030
OK, what's the best way to phrase it?

890
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,544
It is what it is.

891
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,740
Let's get some new plants
for the room, OK?

892
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,300
I can have the desk order something.

893
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,980
Well, I was hoping maybe for mums.

894
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,980
Sure.

895
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,700
And here's a little something
for your trouble.

896
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,620
Oh, no. Vin, this is my job.
I take care of people. Please.

897
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,980
- You go way beyond your job, Ana.
- Oh!

898
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,660
You've been an angel to my Sandy.

899
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,700
OK, Vin. We don't make a habit now, OK?

900
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,187
It can't happen, I'm shit broke.

901
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,540
You got a nice smile.

902
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,300
You should do it more often.

903
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,581
I'll get the laundry.

904
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,746
There you go.

905
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,381
It's a lot lighter.

906
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,349
She didn't change much this week.

907
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,386
Well... easy on my back.

908
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,830
- Thanks.
- Behave yourself, Vin.

909
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,340
He'll pay hundred dollars.

910
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,380
$100? I pay more than that
for one prescription.

911
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,860
He said this is for epilepsy,

912
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,420
for prostate flaring,

913
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,940
and to soften the shitting.

914
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,860
That should have some value.

915
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,744
For who? You?

916
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,904
We need the... I need the dough.

917
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,420
I... 500 bucks!

918
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,180
This is all high-dollar shit.

919
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,060
He said 100, Vin.

920
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,220
You take it or leave this.

921
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,422
You can't sell this to get high.

922
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,021
I'll take a hundred.

923
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,860
Oh, you'll take a hundred?

924
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,710
Stupid...

925
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,540
Hello there.

926
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,420
- Your account's closed, Mr. MacKenna.
- Yeah, I know that.

927
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,022
This withdraw is on my grandson's
account. I think I'm on it.

928
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,421
How much, sir?

929
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,980
What's the balance?

930
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,947
$2,700.

931
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,940
I'll take all that.

932
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,500
How would you like that?

933
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,623
Hundreds, please.

934
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,780
It's $2,700, Larry.

935
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,420
I want a $450 trifecta box
in the third, OK?

936
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,780
I want one, two, three:

937
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,580
Lucky Lincoln, New Dime, Sammy's Savior.

938
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,980
Thank you, sir.

939
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,580
This is gonna make it all better.

940
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,827
OK.

941
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,940
New Dime drops back to sixth,
while back on the rail,

942
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,380
Lucky Lincoln trails well behind,

943
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,660
five lengths behind the rest
of the pack.

944
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,783
You all right, hon?

945
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,071
No, I'm not.

946
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,462
You must think I'm not
a very serious person, Vinny.

947
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,660
You have no right to be here.

948
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,140
You find anything good?

949
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,300
No, some old jewelry. Not worth much.

950
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,340
That's my wife's, you son of a bitch.

951
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,871
You owe me money.

952
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,620
Come on, Vinny!

953
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,980
Why do you always
have to do things the hard way?

954
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,700
It's more interesting.

955
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,380
And a lot more painful.

956
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,346
All right, let's do.

957
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,140
Son of a bitch is crazy.

958
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,423
Don't kill him,
but bring him close to it.

959
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,386
What the... Oh!

960
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,949
What are you doing, old man?

961
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,260
He's dying, dude.

962
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,383
No, he's not. He's...

963
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,670
Don't touch nothing, let's just go.

964
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,585
Let's just go.

965
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,424
Vin?

966
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,425
Vin?

967
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,980
Vin, it's Maggie.

968
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,900
We're gonna put you in this machine,

969
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,940
and we're gonna take some tests,
and it's not gonna hurt a bit.

970
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,221
He can't understand you, Maggie.

971
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,987
OK, there he is. There he is. OK.
It's just gonna be a couple minutes.

972
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,580
Hey, there's my brave little man.

973
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,700
Is he OK? I thought he was dead.

974
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,180
He was just lying there.

975
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,580
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

976
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,300
Well, he looks like that
when he's drunk, too, so...

977
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,660
I don't even know
what you're doing anymore.

978
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,460
I know what I'm doing, and your father's
gonna have a field day with this.

979
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,180
I wouldn't be here instead of with you
if it wasn't for him,

980
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,260
- yet I'm gonna get...
- Mom. Mom. We're doing good.

981
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,140
You're working hard every day,
and we need the money.

982
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,660
It's all right.

983
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,703
OK.

984
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,142
What's wrong with him, anyway?

985
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,584
Think he's had a stroke.

986
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,900
Slowly.

987
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,540
Down, down, down, down, down.

988
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,185
Good, good, bend the knees.

989
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,587
Flat back. Good, good.

990
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,550
Bend the knees. Little bit, little bit.

991
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,740
All right, all right, good.

992
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,660
I chose Saint William of Rochester,

993
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,380
the patron saint of adopted children.

994
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,260
It's a pretty interesting story.

995
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,827
All the other saints
I looked at were all so...

996
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,900
saintly, I guess.

997
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,980
What does saintly mean to you?

998
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,540
I don't know.

999
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,140
I don't really believe in saints
and all that.

1000
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,900
I feel like Saint William
just got to be a saint

1001
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,940
'cause he was killed
by the boy he adopted.

1002
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,660
These days, people get killed
all the time,

1003
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,740
and they don't get to be a saint for it.

1004
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,942
All right, well, thanks, Oliver.

1005
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,940
Despite young Oliver's resistance,

1006
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:48,460
I do happen to believe that there are
saints all around us today.

1007
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,500
They may never be considered
as such by religion,

1008
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,580
but they are just as important
as the ones in your textbooks.

1009
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:59,580
Thus, you are going to research
someone you know, or know of,

1010
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,990
and determine if they have
the qualities fit for sainthood.

1011
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,500
Where is he? His car is here.

1012
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,020
He's in the hospital.

1013
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,140
For what?

1014
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,547
So, how do you and Vincent
know each other?

1015
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,460
I'm working for this man.

1016
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,583
Oh, doing what?

1017
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,703
Working.

1018
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,786
I'm also dancer.

1019
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,864
Wow, that... sounds exciting.

1020
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,900
Try to sound it out.

1021
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,183
Not quite.

1022
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,184
Well, you didn't lose
your sense of humor.

1023
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,700
Hey, Vincent, you've got some visitors.

1024
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,540
I stay five minutes only.

1025
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,940
Hospital is shit place.

1026
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,744
You look a lot better, Vin.

1027
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,789
Get this...

1028
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,380
dipshit out of here.

1029
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,866
What'd you say?

1030
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,540
Get...

1031
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,663
Get this...

1032
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,390
All right.

1033
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,500
How about we just
give Vin some time to do his therapy?

1034
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,020
Thank you. We'll be about an hour.

1035
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,700
Go to hell!

1036
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,540
- An hour.
- Maybe less.

1037
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,180
Why you so mean?
You could stop breathing.

1038
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,420
- Asshole.
- OK, how about we get...

1039
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,420
Hey, we're getting a snack.
Want a snack?

1040
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,146
- Yes, I'm starving.
- Let's get a snack.

1041
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,900
You know, they do think that his muscles
in his mouth will respond to therapy,

1042
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,300
so that's good.

1043
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,820
- He sounds...
- Like the retard.

1044
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,340
Well, he's stupid man anyway.

1045
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,820
So the retard is not far from.

1046
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,860
Do you have dollar?

1047
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,631
I'm starving. I ate nothing today.

1048
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,661
Yeah, I probably have... something.

1049
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,264
Maybe dollar-half is better.

1050
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,745
All right.

1051
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,420
Is that Vin's...

1052
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,100
- Baby?
- Yeah.

1053
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,780
I like to stay away
from the whole situation.

1054
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,780
It's not polite to ask a woman
if she's pregnant.

1055
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:25,340
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
that she's pregnant.

1056
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,220
Vin's, like, 90-something, Mom.
That would be inappropriate.

1057
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,420
Hey, if you hit this machine
as first candy drops,

1058
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,620
you can get two to come down.
It's good, no?

1059
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,743
Thank you.

1060
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,144
Oh, OK.

1061
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,989
Hold on second.

1062
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,102
Don't eat fast, stupid cat.

1063
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,104
I...

1064
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:07,310
I want fresh crap.

1065
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,660
Crab.

1066
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,820
Not crap.

1067
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,740
Crab.

1068
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,022
Not crap.

1069
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,820
OK.

1070
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,670
Money.

1071
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,026
No, it's a... it's a T.

1072
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,300
- Tree. Tree.
- You owe me money.

1073
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,741
- It's a tree. All right.
- Yeah, you broke my tree.

1074
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,786
- I know.
- Yeah, you broke my fence, too.

1075
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,460
OK, what, are you planting these?

1076
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,180
Here, this should be familiar.

1077
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,660
Cactus.

1078
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,300
No, prick.

1079
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,264
Big prick.

1080
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,903
Wonderful, wonderful.

1081
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,270
Daka...

1082
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,309
is beautiful.

1083
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:01,060
I know you just want special massage
or something, a dance later.

1084
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,821
Don't try charming. It doesn't work.

1085
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,660
Don't worry, OK?

1086
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,703
It's going to get better.

1087
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,191
Still there?

1088
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,949
- Wait.
- Sucker!

1089
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,741
Down the stretch they come!

1090
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,469
I'm sorry.

1091
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:04,111
Where's... all my dirt?

1092
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,546
My name's Regina.

1093
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,226
Keep clean this house.

1094
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,340
What's all that?

1095
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,500
Vegetables.

1096
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,270
Get out of that!

1097
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,748
You don't know this, vegetables?

1098
01:13:38,454 --> 01:13:40,108
I do, but...

1099
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,180
I don't eat them.

1100
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:48,620
You do now. And you pay me
for the hours now, Papa, OK?

1101
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,940
What... for?

1102
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,540
I take care of you.

1103
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,500
And we don't bump the ugly parts
no more, OK? So don't ask.

1104
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,300
You're too old for this.

1105
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,300
And I'm too fat.

1106
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,660
$15 for the hours.

1107
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,828
Plus room and food.

1108
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,463
I'll get my secret pickles.

1109
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,308
OK.

1110
01:14:11,255 --> 01:14:13,181
Who is Vincent MacKenna?

1111
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,220
- You know him?
- Yes, he's my neighbor.

1112
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,260
And he sometimes watches Oliver.

1113
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,900
Your Honor, he's my client's neighbor.

1114
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,660
He occasionally watches Oliver,
sometimes.

1115
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,350
He's your babysitter?

1116
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,620
Yeah, I mean, sort of.

1117
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,340
I pay him.

1118
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,660
Oliver, you know, goes over there
for a few hours after school

1119
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,300
when I'm still at work.

1120
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,580
He's the babysitter, Your Honor,
of sorts. A paid position.

1121
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,940
May I ask why this is relevant?

1122
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,180
Is your client aware that Mr. MacKenna

1123
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,740
takes her son to the racetrack,
and they gamble?

1124
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,227
He also takes him to a local bar.

1125
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,700
We went to the horses a few times.

1126
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,789
A few times? Was that fun?

1127
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,471
- Well, a little.
- Yeah, good.

1128
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,820
This is completely news to me.
I've never heard this before.

1129
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,500
My client is unaware of these events,
as am I,

1130
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,220
which is a big surprise right now.

1131
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,100
I'll bet there are quite a few surprises
in this folder, then.

1132
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,667
- Oh, God.
- Daka Parimova?

1133
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,988
Are you aware of her occupation?

1134
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,300
She works for Vin.

1135
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,468
She works for Vince, right?

1136
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,300
- She's a lady of the night.
- What?

1137
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,309
Do you know what that means?

1138
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,949
She works at night?

1139
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,300
She may be a prostitute.

1140
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:50,060
Your Honor, I need a few minutes to...
confer with my client.

1141
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,910
I imagine you do.

1142
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,660
I guess gambling and a racetrack
is like a math class?

1143
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,020
- You got to learn how to bet?
- The odds.

1144
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,060
The bar. Guess that could fall
under current events, right?

1145
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,262
More like social studies.

1146
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,708
It's the strip club hooker
that I can't seem to get my head around.

1147
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,031
Commerce?

1148
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,781
Biology?

1149
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,351
Just stop talking. Don't talk.

1150
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,389
Vin!

1151
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,421
Vin!

1152
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,500
Why do you people think
my people can't hear?

1153
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,260
What kind of a man takes a child
to a bar and to the racetrack?

1154
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,460
And has him hanging out
with a prostitute?

1155
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,420
What kind of mother

1156
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,820
lets her son hang out

1157
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,100
with a man l-l-l-like that?

1158
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,140
You're an asshole, Vin.

1159
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,620
50-50 custody with his asshole dad,
and I have you to thank for that.

1160
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:02,100
You have no one
but yourself to blame for that.

1161
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,143
He needs more than...

1162
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,864
a deadbeat mother.

1163
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,260
Good one, and maybe I deserve that.

1164
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,500
I don't know what I was thinking
letting him hang out with you.

1165
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,700
My sentiments exactly.

1166
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,660
Well, he's not coming over there
anymore. That's a given.

1167
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,540
I'll get you your money
for your stupid tree.

1168
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,780
There'll be some interest.

1169
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,311
Yeah, good luck with that.

1170
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,823
Oh, I'm sorry! Sorry!

1171
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,380
My reaction time is much slower
these days.

1172
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,070
Yeah, you were never fast, just stupid.

1173
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,064
You have seven new messages.

1174
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,980
Hello, Vin.
This is Ana here at Sunnyside.

1175
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,500
I'm afraid we have some bad
news regarding your wife, Sandy, sir.

1176
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,385
Please call us as soon as you get this.

1177
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,860
Vin, hello, it's Ana again at Sunnyside.

1178
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,900
We haven't heard back from you
regarding Sandy.

1179
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,626
Please call us right away.

1180
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:25,620
Vincent, we've left a few messages
for you. We haven't heard back.

1181
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,460
We really need to hear from you
about Sandy.

1182
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,583
Please call or come by
as soon as possible.

1183
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,700
Feeling OK?

1184
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,380
- It's a bit chilly.
- Yes, it is.

1185
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,420
OK.

1186
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,190
Here we go, Vin.

1187
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,305
All of Sandy's personal items
are in there.

1188
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,820
My wife, where is she?

1189
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,060
She died, Vin.

1190
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,220
I know that.

1191
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,940
Where is she?

1192
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,029
She's in there.

1193
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,980
Where?

1194
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,060
In the box.

1195
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,705
Her remains, Vin.

1196
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,420
She died a few weeks ago.

1197
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,660
We tried contacting you several times.

1198
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,540
And when we didn't hear back from you,

1199
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,260
we decided to go ahead
with your death directives.

1200
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,541
You wanted her cremated.

1201
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,220
She's in that box?

1202
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,660
Her remains are, Vin, yes.

1203
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,182
In a box inside that box.

1204
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,543
I am sorry for your loss, Vin.

1205
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,180
This place is peace.

1206
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:09,748
It... w-w-w-was.

1207
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,820
Nah, I didn't study. I never study.

1208
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,590
- OK, see you later.
- See you around, man.

1209
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,420
- All right.
- Later, Oliver.

1210
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,380
- Hey, you got a lot of homework?
- Hey.

1211
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,100
Art, some math.

1212
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,381
OK.

1213
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,660
Is she with us?

1214
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:36,140
Yeah, she's your father's idea
of safer child care.

1215
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,300
What's her name?

1216
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,980
You have a voice, you ask her.

1217
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,740
Excuse me, what's your name?

1218
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,100
Amelda.

1219
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,580
Hi, Amelda.

1220
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,900
Hola, Mr. Oliver.

1221
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,580
Is she every day?

1222
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,500
And every other weekend
when you're gonna go to your dad's.

1223
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,980
That's what it's gonna be now, bub.

1224
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,660
You're gonna get shuffled back
and forth between me and him.

1225
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,140
Well, he is my dad.

1226
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:01,260
I know he cheated on you
a bunch of times, and...

1227
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,740
that's why we left him.

1228
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,102
Really?

1229
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,220
How do you know that?

1230
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,820
You'll tell anybody who'll listen.

1231
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,620
Grandma, Aunt Judy, all the cousins.

1232
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,948
It's also your Facebook status.

1233
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,390
I know. I've been meaning
to change that.

1234
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,500
I should just say I'm single.

1235
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,190
Yeah, that's better.

1236
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,271
Hey, Vin.

1237
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,940
M-My replacement?

1238
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,660
Yeah, I guess so.

1239
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,940
I'd hate to have to report your mother
to immigration and Natur...

1240
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,551
I am a citizen.

1241
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:54,024
Mr. Oliver, one minute.

1242
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,140
What's in the box?

1243
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,308
My wife.

1244
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,220
She died?

1245
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,940
No.

1246
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,260
Sh...

1247
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,900
She shrunk herself.

1248
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,943
She's living in there now.

1249
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,151
Rent-free.

1250
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,630
Sorry, Vin, for your loss.

1251
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:18,744
Never understood...

1252
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:22,986
wh-wh-why people say that.

1253
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,220
They don't know what else to say.

1254
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,620
How about, "What was she like?

1255
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:34,269
Do you miss her?"
Or "What are you gonna do now?"

1256
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,860
Do yourself a favor.

1257
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,260
Get a life.

1258
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,906
Stop living mine.

1259
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,180
Take my word.

1260
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,020
It's not working for shit for me.

1261
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,260
That's not true.

1262
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,462
What the he...

1263
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,063
hell do you know about me?

1264
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,547
You don't know me.

1265
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,548
You're just stupid.

1266
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,781
Of course I'm stupid.

1267
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,060
Mostly for thinking

1268
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:20,424
you're more than just
a drunk, mean old man.

1269
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,861
Guess that's goodbye.

1270
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,060
You're a sad...

1271
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,149
sad man.

1272
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,629
I loved you to the moon there, Sandy.

1273
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,223
I loved you to the moon.

1274
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,020
All right, two weeks.

1275
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,260
Two weeks to
our Saints Among Us assembly.

1276
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:03,100
The grand culmination of your sizable
efforts on one great stage.

1277
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,660
Don't forget to invite your parents,
significant others, et cetera.

1278
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,460
Wives, girlfriends,
and enjoy yourselves.

1279
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:12,820
And no expletives in your presentation,
please, Ocinski.

1280
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,500
He doesn't like Ocinski,
Brother Geraghty, never has.

1281
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,144
The name's Robert, sir.

1282
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,940
He didn't tell you he was a soldier?

1283
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,380
No, sir.

1284
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,789
A sergeant major, of all things.
He's famous.

1285
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,660
But it's too expensive.

1286
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,660
I don't know how to buy this crib

1287
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,260
that looks nice
and is cheap enough. I...

1288
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,500
Oh, this one? This is good.

1289
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,060
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
this is the wrong price.

1290
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,380
I like this.

1291
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,860
No, no, no, I like this.

1292
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,860
- This is great. I love this.
- I take it.

1293
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,420
- This is fantastic.
- Can we get this?

1294
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,580
We can afford this.

1295
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,180
- Ma'am...
- This is nice.

1296
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,700
I like this. I want this.

1297
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,940
This is great.

1298
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,471
OK, I'll take it.

1299
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,180
That's the old guy?

1300
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,340
Yeah, he was in Vietnam.

1301
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,620
Did I study the states?

1302
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:20,940
It's a country.

1303
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,420
States are inside countries.

1304
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,460
"Do not place items
with string around child's neck,

1305
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,140
such as hoods strings or pacifier cords.

1306
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,820
Strings can cause strangulation."

1307
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,420
I don't want this crib.

1308
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,907
Hey, Dad.

1309
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,340
- Good day?
- Yeah.

1310
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,980
All right, seat belt, please.

1311
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,300
How long has Vin
been doing Sandy's laundry?

1312
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,980
Oh, geez, every week for eight years.

1313
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,540
That's a long time.

1314
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,260
It is a long time.

1315
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,269
He's a good guy, Vin.

1316
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,180
What's Vin like when I'm not around?

1317
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,860
He don't like people.

1318
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,700
People don't like him.

1319
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,900
Except cat and you.

1320
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,340
Why you like him?

1321
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,100
That'll be straight.

1322
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,823
Oliver, come on!

1323
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,869
Breakfast is ready!

1324
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,149
Gonna get cold!

1325
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,466
Let's go!

1326
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,940
- Hi, Mom.
- Don't look so surprised. Sit down.

1327
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,462
You need some fuel
for your big day, right? Sit.

1328
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,100
- You made all this?
- Yes, I made it all.

1329
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,300
I know how to cook.

1330
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,540
I took the day off.

1331
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,860
- Thanks.
- Well, you're welcome, bub.

1332
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,940
This giving you trouble?

1333
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,949
Come here, I'll show you the trick.

1334
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,589
You got to pop this up.

1335
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,540
OK.

1336
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:15,266
Like that, it's like magic.

1337
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,420
I love you, Mom.

1338
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,550
Me, too.

1339
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,220
Sit down.

1340
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,070
OK, coffee or juice?

1341
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,062
- Latte?
- Nice try.

1342
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:39,740
Oh! My water is broken!

1343
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,180
Call a plumber.

1344
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,825
Let's go.

1345
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,141
Get up!

1346
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,940
Hello. Sit down, children, thank you.

1347
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:03,140
Good morning. Welcome to
our Saints Among Us assembly

1348
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,940
here at St. Patrick.

1349
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,500
And the children have been working very
hard, and it'll be interesting to see

1350
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,980
which parents they have chosen
as saints.

1351
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,540
I'm sure you're all very nervous.

1352
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,621
Our first speaker is Keesha Demorcy.

1353
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,220
For my real-life saint,

1354
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,900
I picked Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

1355
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,590
- OK, OK.
- Stop anywhere! Anywhere!

1356
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,106
When will you become like man?

1357
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,060
Jesus, my manhood!

1358
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,786
Saint Nicholas of Sunnyside, everybody.

1359
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,020
All right, next up we have
Oliver Bronstein.

1360
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,220
Oliver Bronstein.

1361
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,580
Saints are human beings
we celebrate for their commitment

1362
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,740
and dedication to other human beings.

1363
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:14,340
Brother Geraghty, circa around March.

1364
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,580
This isn't the hospital.

1365
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:26,387
So now you are rocket surgeon.
Come on, get inside.

1366
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,380
For my modern day saint,

1367
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,860
I chose a man who shares
many of the same qualities

1368
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,740
as Saint William of Rochester.

1369
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,620
On the surface, one might think my saint

1370
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:38,260
is the least likely candidate
for sainthood.

1371
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,460
He's not a happy person.

1372
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,260
He doesn't like people,
and not many people like him.

1373
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:46,220
He's grumpy, angry,

1374
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,741
mad at the world,
and I'm sure full of regrets.

1375
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,860
He drinks too much, smokes.

1376
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,460
He gambles, curses, lies and cheats.

1377
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,630
And he spends a lot of time
with a lady of the night.

1378
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:03,900
- That's what you see at first glance.
- After you.

1379
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,501
If you dig deeper, you'll see
a man beyond his flaws.

1380
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,340
Mr. Vincent MacKenna was born in 1946

1381
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,020
in Sheepshead Bay,

1382
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,144
the son of first-generation
Irish immigrants.

1383
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,940
Growing up poor
on the streets of Brooklyn,

1384
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,260
Vincent learned all the things
that kids shouldn't need to know:

1385
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,860
fighting, cursing and gambling.

1386
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,860
In 1965, as a member of the
United States Army's Fifth Regiment,

1387
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,900
Vincent was among the 450 soldiers

1388
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,220
dropped into the La Drang Valley
and immediately ambushed

1389
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,020
by 2,000 enemy troops.

1390
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,860
There he heroically saved the lives
of two wounded officers

1391
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,780
pinned down by enemy fire
and carried them to safety.

1392
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,540
He was awarded the Bronze Star
for his bravery.

1393
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,420
I imagine the best way I can tell you

1394
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,260
who Mr. Vincent MacKenna is

1395
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:59,500
is to tell you what he's done for me.

1396
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,700
When me and my mom first moved here,
we knew no one,

1397
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,460
and Mr. MacKenna took me in
when he didn't have to,

1398
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,300
and most likely didn't want to.

1399
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,231
But he did it anyhow,
'cause that's what saints do.

1400
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:16,980
We visited his wife, Sandy,
of 40 years, who recently passed away.

1401
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:20,420
Vin's done her laundry every week
for the past eight years,

1402
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,380
long after she no longer recognized him.

1403
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,340
Because saints never give up.

1404
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,980
He taught me how to fight,

1405
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,060
how to stand my ground and be brave,

1406
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,180
how to speak up and be bold.

1407
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,780
Because saints fight
for themselves and others,

1408
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,780
so that they might be heard.

1409
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,540
He taught me how to gamble,
horse racing,

1410
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,620
Keno, the over and under,

1411
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,740
which is a big reason
why I'm grounded till I'm 18.

1412
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,660
But in that, I learned how to take risks

1413
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:49,940
and go for broke.

1414
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,700
Because in life,
the odds can be stacked against you.

1415
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,540
This is Vin's cat, Felix,

1416
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:58,580
who eats gourmet cat food
while Vin eats sardines.

1417
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:02,260
'Cause saints make sacrifices.

1418
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:04,620
Yes, Mr. Vincent MacKenna is flawed,

1419
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:09,220
seriously flawed, but just like
all the other saints we studied.

1420
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,420
Because after all,
saints are human beings,

1421
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,380
very human beings.

1422
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:17,300
Courage, sacrifice,
compassion, humanity.

1423
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,460
These are the markings of a saint,

1424
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,620
and what makes Mr. Vincent MacKenna
not so far removed

1425
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,580
from Saint William of Rochester.

1426
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,820
And with that, I'd like to present
my friend and babysitter,

1427
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,580
Mr. Vincent MacKenna, for sainthood,

1428
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,540
and hereby proclaim him

1429
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,710
St. Vincent of Sheepshead Bay.

1430
01:34:21,648 --> 01:34:23,382
Thank you, sir.

1431
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,831
Thank you, kid.

1432
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,225
Saint Vincent of Sheepshead Bay.

1433
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,580
All right, I got it.
I owe you money anyhow.

1434
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,191
- Thanks.
- What are you looking at?

1435
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,540
- Hard pretzels.
- That's just what I was looking at.

1436
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,420
If you do it just right,

1437
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,300
you can end up with...

1438
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,390
two... for the price of one.

1439
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,420
Pretty cool.

1440
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,180
That's pretty good, kiddo.

1441
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,420
I might have to adopt that.

1442
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,740
Mr. MacKenna, it's about that time.

1443
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,430
All right, hold your horses.

1444
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,588
Although, technically, that's stealing.

1445
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,980
Oh, it's OK, it's OK. Don't cry.

1446
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:28,820
It's OK.

1447
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,060
So what is it?

1448
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:33,260
Black, white, ugly?

1449
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,780
Get out of here.

1450
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,108
I like this baby.

1451
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,302
Do you like this baby?

1452
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,020
Yeah, so far.

1453
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:46,951
I'm so happy.

1454
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,260
I'll teach you someday.

1455
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,660
- You'll like it.
- Boys, come on.

1456
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:59,140
It's not Russian, but... Oh, sorry, cat.

1457
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,380
OK, you must eat vegetables.

1458
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,500
It's colorful.

1459
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,700
I'll say that.

1460
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,380
- I like the green beans.
- You do?

1461
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,340
Yeah, I don't think you ever get
enough spaghetti and green beans.

1462
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,300
My mom makes them out of a can.

1463
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:12,740
That's how your brain got stilted.

1464
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,860
Oh, you have stilted brain.

1465
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,300
- That's probably good.
- Like the retard.

1466
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,180
Hey, the "R" word's not cool.

1467
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,020
It's not politically correct.

1468
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,260
- Why is this?
- It's like when you say "midget."

1469
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,900
"Midget"?

1470
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,704
Why not "midget"?

1471
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,187
This food beats hunger.

1472
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,865
By a hair.

1473
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,700
Don't you want to say something?

1474
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,860
Like what?

1475
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,381
Like a blessing or a prayer?

1476
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,900
No, I'd better not.

1477
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,220
Baby is hungry.

1478
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,185
All this delicious food,
and where's yours?

1479
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:08,309
It's not fair for everyone
to have a big meal except you?

1480
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,740
Oh!

1481
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:14,220
Hey, wow, it's chill...

1482
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,945
it's getting chilly in here.

1483
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,420
<i>One of toil and blood</i>

1484
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,580
<i>When blackness was a virtue</i>

1485
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,623
<i>The road was full of mud</i>

1486
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,060
<i>Came in from the wilderness</i>

1487
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,060
<i>A creature void of form</i>

1488
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,580
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1489
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,703
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1490
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,420
<i>Pass this way again</i>

1491
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,065
<i>You can rest assured</i>

1492
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,620
<i>I'll always do my best for her</i>

1493
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,540
<i>On that I give my word</i>

1494
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,740
I smell the cigarette, asshole!

1495
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,540
<i>Fight to be won</i>

1496
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:08,740
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1497
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:10,430
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1498
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,340
<i>Not a word was spoke between us</i>

1499
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,020
<i>There was little risk involved</i>

1500
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:21,700
<i>Everything up to that point</i>

1501
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,420
<i>Had been left unresolved</i>

1502
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,620
<i>Try imagining a place</i>

1503
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:28,740
<i>Where it's always safe and warm</i>

1504
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:30,740
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1505
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,863
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1506
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,340
<i>I was burned out from exhaustion</i>

1507
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,020
<i>Buried in the hay</i>

1508
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,860
<i>Poisoned in the bushes</i>

1509
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,300
<i>And blown out on the trail</i>

1510
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,380
<i>Hunted like a crocodile</i>

1511
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:56,020
<i>Ravaged in the corn</i>

1512
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,180
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1513
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,542
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1514
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,300
<i>Suddenly I turned around</i>

1515
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,540
<i>And she was standing there</i>

1516
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,940
<i>With silver bracelets on her wrists</i>

1517
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,060
<i>And flowers in her hair</i>

1518
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,340
<i>She walked up to me so gracefully</i>

1519
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,580
<i>And took my crown of thorns</i>

1520
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,620
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1521
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:26,061
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1522
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:35,260
<i>Now there's a wall between us</i>

1523
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,300
<i>Something has been lost</i>

1524
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,900
<i>I took too much for granted</i>

1525
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,540
<i>I got my signals crossed</i>

1526
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:44,140
<i>Just to think it all began</i>

1527
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:46,980
<i>On a non-eventful morn</i>

1528
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,380
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1529
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,389
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1530
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,820
<i>Well, the deputy walks on hard nails</i>

1531
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,780
<i>And the preacher rides a mount</i>

1532
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,940
<i>But nothing really matters much</i>

1533
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,620
<i>It's doom alone that counts</i>

1534
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,420
<i>And the one-eyed undertaker</i>

1535
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,300
<i>He blows a futile horn</i>

1536
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,940
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1537
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,427
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1538
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:27,740
<i>I've heard newborn babies wailing</i>

1539
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,660
<i>Like a morning dove</i>

1540
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,700
<i>And old men with broken teeth</i>

1541
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,740
<i>Stranded without love</i>

1542
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,580
<i>Do I understand your question, man</i>

1543
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,300
<i>Is it hopeless, forlorn</i>

1544
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,820
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1545
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,546
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1546
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:52,220
<i>In a little hilltop village</i>

1547
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,420
<i>They gambled for my clothes</i>

1548
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,420
<i>I bargained for salvation</i>

1549
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,540
<i>And they gave me a lethal dose</i>

1550
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,180
<i>I offered up my innocence</i>

1551
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,220
<i>And got repaid with scorn</i>

1552
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:05,180
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1553
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,667
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1554
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,580
<i>Well, I'm living in a foreign country</i>

1555
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:20,780
<i>But I'm bound to cross the line</i>

1556
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,660
<i>Beauty walks on razor's edge</i>

1557
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,220
<i>Someday I'll make it mine</i>

1558
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,060
<i>If I could only turn back the clock</i>

1559
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,900
<i>To when God and her were born</i>

1560
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,386
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

1561
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,231
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

1561
01:41:34,305 --> 01:42:34,762
