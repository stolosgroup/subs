00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,897
Let's, uhm...
Let's not have people come in.

3
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:28,754
I'd like to do this without
anybody in here.

4
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:31,809
Could everybody split, that
doesn't have to be here. Thanks.

5
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,874
- Maybe we can keep...
- And close the door.

6
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,552
- Keep people away from the door.
- Is that good?

7
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:38,116
Yep. Thank you.

8
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:56,704
"And never have I felt so
deeply at one and the same time

9
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:04,695
so detached from myself
and so present in the world"

10
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,951
(Albert Camus)
French philosopher and writer

11
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:26,274
"For Henry"

12
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:39,168
I wasn't good in school.
I didn't care for school.

13
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:43,308
Uhm... It was nice socially,
my own experience, but

14
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:44,638
I kinda just went along...

15
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,709
I started off as a music major.

16
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,149
I was gonna be
a Rock 'n' Roll star.

17
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,750
But that didn't quite
work out.

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,730
In 1985,

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,941
during a hurricane,
hurricane Gloria,

20
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,681
I was walk... I was taking
a train into the city to work.

21
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,732
I'd gotten to work and I was on
the phone with my brother-in-law,

22
00:02:04,932 --> 00:02:07,932
who had just
started teaching,

23
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:10,013
and he said that he was
off from school.

24
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,431
Now, now,
wait a second,

25
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,233
You're off from school
for hurricane

26
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:16,244
and I'm goin' into the city
to work in an Office building?

27
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:19,334
I said: "Whoa, that's a
pretty good kick, right."

28
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:24,805
My mom was a teacher and I knew
without a shadow of a doubt

29
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:27,836
from early childhood that
the one job I would never do

30
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:29,416
was become a teacher.

31
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:33,516
Never ever I would take
toll cards on a turnpike.

32
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:37,448
I'd be a sheppard, anything,
rather than become a teacher.

33
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:41,148
I decided to become a teacher
because I wanted to do

34
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:43,088
something with my life besides
what I was doing

35
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:45,839
which was driving a truck,
for a company and,

36
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,639
I decided I wanted to do
a little bit better for myself

37
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,090
so I got into teaching
a little bit.

38
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:53,740
I went back to school
at the age of 37.

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,810
A friend of mine from college...

40
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:57,761
His aunt was the...

41
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:00,061
Principle of an all-girls
inner city school

42
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,592
in Newark, New Jersey, and
they were desperate for teachers

43
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:06,591
So, I thought "Great,
I can do this for a year,

44
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:09,943
it'll keep my father from making
me get a job at Prudential,

45
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:14,084
and then I'll figure out
what I wanna do."

46
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:19,245
Well, they called me up
asking me to go to an interview,

47
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:21,585
and I happened to get an job

48
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:23,705
in a Junior High school,
in Queens,

49
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,186
and I ended up...

50
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:30,457
starting it at my...
What's now?... my 30th year.

51
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,548
Most of the teachers here,
at one point...

52
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:41,258
...they believed...,

53
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:44,699
that they could
make a difference

54
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,500
You know, I know
how important it is to

55
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,750
have guidance and to have

56
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:59,792
someone help understand
the complexities

57
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:01,532
of the world
that we live in.

58
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:06,423
I didn't really have that
growing up.

59
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,969
I am money.

60
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,970
I change hands
like a dollar bill

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,900
that's been robbed
by a lamp

62
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,691
when a genie appeared
and cried loudly, with volume.

63
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:57,251
But the tears were
all for myself.

64
00:04:57,511 --> 00:05:00,262
And that's where it
all went wrong.

65
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,898
Hi, Lupe, Dean Vargas here.

66
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,449
I'm sick and I won't be
coming in today, all right?

67
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,490
Get to the point, Dr. Heart.
I've got a school to run.

68
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,329
The State's score have gone
down in the last three years.

69
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,261
- You're not delivering...
- Don't pretend like you don't know the game.

70
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:53,471
You earmarked my school
as the transfer dome

71
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:55,481
for the worst kids in
the district.

72
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,272
Well, kids deserve an education,
don't you agree?

73
00:05:57,282 --> 00:05:59,612
I agree you're jerking of
and wasting my time.

74
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:02,493
- Get to the point, Dr. Heart...
- We need consensus builders.

75
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:05,723
- New methodology.
- You're corporatizing the system.

76
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:08,524
No, we're cleaning house.

77
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:11,774
Our superintendent feels that
it's time your stepped down.

78
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:15,175
Babe, you got some fuckin'
nerve coming into my yard

79
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:16,775
with the heart fuckin' self.

80
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:20,276
Carol, there was a time
when you were an educator.

81
00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:23,576
You were very well respected.

82
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:27,477
Why don't you go
out on top?

83
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,959
Oi!

84
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,379
Everybody sit down
and shut up,

85
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,440
or I'll start pulling out
the referrals.

86
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,540
Sit!

87
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,070
Sit down!

88
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,801
I am starting the DVD.

89
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,611
I am starting the DVD.

90
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:20,946
- Barth or Barthes
- Barth. Mr. Barth.

91
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:22,860
Mr. Barth Henry

92
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,276
So you've taken long term
assignments at the

93
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:28,457
"Lock and McArthur"?

94
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:29,907
The Fringe.

95
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:32,338
Well, that's... That's...
where the works are.

96
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:37,039
This a month-long assignment,
until I can fill it permanently.

97
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:39,189
I asked to meet with you
because you come

98
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,390
highly recommended as the
best sub on the call sheet.

99
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,990
That's a somewhat
dubious endorsement.

100
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,190
I agree, Mr. Barth.

101
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:51,681
You'll find many of your
students functioning

102
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:53,092
well below grade level.

103
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,842
That's your task to try
and get them caught up.

104
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:58,742
Teach the Curriculum,
most importantly.

105
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,443
Understood?

106
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:17,199
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

107
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,676
I'm Mr. Barth.

108
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:21,916
Those of you who haven't
heard, this is English 11 A.

109
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:22,871
- Yes.
- Yeah.

110
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,797
Listen up, I have one rule.

111
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:26,510
Just one.

112
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,598
If you don't wish to be here

113
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:31,248
don't come.

114
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:33,098
Dude, what does that mean?

115
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,689
It's not dude, it's Mr. Barth.

116
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,309
The S is silent.

117
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:39,509
- You're fuckin' gay.
- Marcus, shut up!

118
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,279
No, you shut up!

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,530
You diet Bitch!

120
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:48,281
Hey, Marcus.

121
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,181
Guess what.

122
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:51,400
What?

123
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:52,552
You're free to leave.

124
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:54,652
- Like right now?
- Like right now.

125
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:57,602
- Hiya...
- See you later, man.

126
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,432
What's the fuck?
You want me to go to the Dean's Office?

127
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:02,853
I don't care where you go.

128
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:04,564
Everyone pull out
a sheet of paper.

129
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:06,824
I'd like to assess what your
individual writing skills are.

130
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,604
What if we got no paper?

131
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:11,305
Okay here is the situation.
You're dead.

132
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:14,255
Alright, write an brief
but detailed essay about...

133
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:16,675
Hey jackass! I asked you
a fucking question!

134
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:19,756
...about what a friend
or a parent

135
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,817
might say about you
during your funeral. OK?

136
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,987
- You have 30 minutes.
- Oh, shit...

137
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:31,438
I asked you a motherfuckin'
question, didn't I?

138
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:40,746
Anything else?

139
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,991
You'd better back the fuck up
before I fuckin' wreck your shit.

140
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:49,321
That bag,

141
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:53,871
It doesn't have any feelings.
It's empty.

142
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:57,313
I don't have any feelings
you can hurt either. OK?

143
00:09:57,713 --> 00:10:00,303
I understand you're angry.

144
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:04,064
I used to be very
angry too, OK. I get it.

145
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:06,564
You have no reason to be
angry with me, because

146
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:09,965
I am one of the few people that's
here trying to give you an opportunity.

147
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:11,584
Now I am going to ask you,

148
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:15,316
you just sit down,
and do your best,

149
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:19,316
and I'll give you a piece
of paper. How's that?

150
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:27,408
Can I get a fuckin' pen too?

151
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:31,818
Kids don't have any
attention span. They're bored.

152
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:35,819
So how are you supposed to
reel them in with classic literature

153
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:43,161
if they don't believe
that you

154
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:46,841
have something meaningful
to share.

155
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,142
Thank you.

156
00:10:56,803 --> 00:11:00,223
Why did you throw Marcus
out of class but not Jerry?

157
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,824
Well I had to make an
example out of somebody.

158
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:05,172
You know, Marcus verbally
assaulted you,

159
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,025
and that's not allowed
in my classroom.

160
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:09,985
And, what they say to me
isn't material.

161
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:12,846
What's your name?

162
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:13,966
Meredith.

163
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,956
Nice to meet you, Meredith.

164
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:20,827
So you really don't care
what the kids say to you?

165
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:23,057
Perhaps I've gotten
used to it.

166
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:24,728
I wish I could be
that strong.

167
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:28,028
It doesn't take strength,
Meredith. You gotta...

168
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:32,829
understand that unfortunately
most people lack self-awareness.

169
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:34,629
You should really keep that
in mind as you had

170
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,600
another transient of
second period.

171
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,680
You'll meet them again
at every age.

172
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:46,051
- I want to see the Principle!
- That's her, mom.

173
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,951
You're the bitch that expelled
my baby? And for what?

174
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:51,732
- Excuse me, maybe you'd like...
- Because you can't handle it?

175
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:53,262
Bitch why are you here?

176
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:56,072
You wanna be at home every day.
I don't have time for this bullshit!

177
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:58,393
- Keep your voice down!
- Why are you here?

178
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,834
Hey ma'am, calm down.
We'll go talk about this

179
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:03,383
in the Dean's Office.
- I ain't goin' nowhere with you.

180
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:05,335
Look, miss, I know
you're angry

181
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:07,935
but they won't listen to you,
you need to talk to me.

182
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:11,026
- Racist bitch, I'ma sue your ass.
- Come on, ladies.

183
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,179
This way

184
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:14,836
- Ladies
- What happened?

185
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:17,087
Bitch, if you gimme
any mo' shit in the class

186
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:21,337
and I'ma getta my niggas
fuckin' gang rape your ass!

187
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,429
- Excuse me. Are you new here?
- It's, first day.

188
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,091
Welcome. That was quite
a scene back there.

189
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:47,322
I was a little stunned.
But it's actually safe here.

190
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:50,892
- Sorry, I'm Miss Madison.
- I am Henry, Henry Barth.

191
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:16,427
Whatever is on my mind,
I say there's a feeling.

192
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,067
I'm truthful to myself.

193
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:21,538
I am young,
and I'm old.

194
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:24,108
I've been bought
and I've been sold,

195
00:13:24,228 --> 00:13:26,548
so many times.

196
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,880
I am hard to face.
I am gone.

197
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,230
I am just like you.

198
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,540
Patricia!

199
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,022
Patricia!

200
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,435
- Hello?
- Henry, it's Rita, from the hospital.

201
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,245
He's done it again, you
need to get down here.

202
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,436
Bastards, leave me alone!

203
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:11,654
Why aren't you
handling this?

204
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:12,937
I can't get him out!

205
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:16,507
- You come and get him.
- Patricia.

206
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:21,848
Thanks.

207
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,709
Grandpa, come on.
It's Henry, open the door.

208
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:27,339
Patricia!

209
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,339
No, it's Henry. It's Henry.

210
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:31,439
- Who?
- It's Henry.

211
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,960
Grandpa, please, open...
Open the door.

212
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,961
Hi, sweetheart.

213
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:44,032
I thought you were
your mom.

214
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:46,662
You're dressed okay, there...

215
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:48,462
Were you going somewhere?

216
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:50,422
Now I'm goin' to work.

217
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,733
You are tired, OK?

218
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:58,124
It's very, very late so I need
you to go to sleep, OK?

219
00:14:58,474 --> 00:15:00,765
Let's come to bed.

220
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:05,775
How're you doin', huh?

221
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:14,467
Some old people sleep
a lot before they die.

222
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:19,318
Isn't that silly?

223
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:43,772
- Everything okay?
- You shut up!

224
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:44,841
You listen

225
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,822
I know you're just some
under-educated drone

226
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,673
passing the time with
these old dying people

227
00:15:50,923 --> 00:15:54,374
But I'm paying for his assisted
living, and you're not assisting him.

228
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:58,074
I told you, take the lock
off of his bathroom door!

229
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,495
You know how he gets
at night and forgets?

230
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:04,075
So you need to be there for
him, to make him feel safe.

231
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,676
Let me be very clear here!

232
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:11,126
You stop neglecting his needs
or I'll start fucking with yours!

233
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:13,177
I will have you fired!

234
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:15,927
Then it's gonna
be your family!

235
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:17,477
Your children,

236
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,878
are gonna be at risk!

237
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,430
You got it?!

238
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:22,823
I got it.

239
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:27,379
Don't you ever make me come
down here again at this hour, OK?

240
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:19,538
Gimme the fuckin' money!

241
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:21,789
You heard me!
Gimme the fuckin' money!

242
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:24,509
Give me the fucking
money now!

243
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,689
You think I like you?
Give me the fucking money!

244
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:28,740
- You want money?
- Now!

245
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:13,298
Why are you following me?

246
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:16,658
I am not. It's late, you should
be home, not to screw men.

247
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,889
What? Are you crazy now?

248
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:20,959
- What the fuck is your deal, huh?
- Get away from me.

249
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,899
Why did you let that guy
beat the shit out of me?

250
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:27,199
Huh? You just sat there, like you
were a fuckin lemon or something.

251
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,300
Excuse me, I don't wanna
talk to you.

252
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,270
You think there's something
wrong with that?

253
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:31,200
Listen, little kid.

254
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:33,369
I don't know how old you
were when it all went wrong,

255
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,039
but this isn't
the fucking answer, OK?

256
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,151
You'll figure it out,

257
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,902
'cause you're gonna get
really old really quick.

258
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:39,402
Know that!
- Why are you so mean to me, huh?

259
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:40,922
You don't think I have feelings?

260
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:43,503
Do you?
Do you have feelings?

261
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:44,523
Listen, pal!

262
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,113
I mean, between you and me

263
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,004
you look like you've got
more problems than me.

264
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:50,904
- Oh really?
- Yeah, really!

265
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:53,404
- So come on, I'll make you better.
- What are you doing? Get off, please.

266
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,504
- Are you flirting with me?
- Nothing,

267
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:56,325
I'm just offering to hang out,
if you know what I mean.

268
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,255
- I don't wanna hang out with you.
- I don't know. You seem kinda lonely.

269
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:01,396
Maybe we go back
to your place just relax.

270
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,906
Afraid you'll like it?

271
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,207
I'm afraid you've been
fucked and thrown away

272
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:09,097
so many times
you've gotten used to it.

273
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,667
Fuck you, man!

274
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:13,658
Fuck off, queer.

275
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:16,448
Have a good night, yeah.

276
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:18,399
Yeah, yeah!
Just walk away? Hey?

277
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:21,439
Where are you going?

278
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,892
"He just fucks
their shit up, and..."

279
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:42,503
"The ladies cry for me..."

280
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,431
"At the funeral"

281
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,013
"'cause I ain’t around no more,"

282
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:49,554
"to dicks that split up..."

283
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,836
"Raw and shit..."

284
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:54,894
"And ma boys all gets faded..."

285
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:58,925
"pleasin' that skunk shit and fuck."

286
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:01,016
Toni V.

287
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,137
You know it's funny
I spend a lot of time

288
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:12,218
trying to not have to deal,
to not really commit.

289
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,298
I am a substitute teacher.

290
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:16,939
There's no real
responsibility to teach.

291
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:19,819
The responsibility is
to maintain order,

292
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:22,820
make sure nobody kills
anybody in your classroom,

293
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,280
and then they get
to the next period.

294
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,280
"She used to be a sweet girl"

295
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,370
"She never seemed
dissatisfied with her life."

296
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:30,931
"And why should she have been?"

297
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:33,731
"Her mother and I gave her
everything she needed..."

298
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,422
"So why did she
become so angry?"

299
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:39,652
"So miserable and mean
all of a sudden"

300
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,875
"We don't know."

301
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:43,133
"Frankly, it doesn't reflect on us."

302
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,413
"We were good parents"

303
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:48,974
"But still, she repaid us
for all we've done"

304
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,024
"by killing herself"

305
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:54,024
"Stupid selfish Child"

306
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:58,276
"Now she'll never
get into Princeton"

307
00:20:58,514 --> 00:21:00,356
No name.

308
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:07,107
"Hi Lupe, Dean Vargas again"

309
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:09,489
"I can't do it anymore"

310
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,519
" I... um I quit! "

311
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:22,200
Oh, if it isn't
the lovely Dr. Parker.

312
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,430
Would you like a happy pill
to help you through the day?

313
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,420
They're yummy.

314
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,900
I need you to fill in for Dean
Vargas in the second period.

315
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:33,132
I'm worried about you, Charlie.

316
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:41,433
I just, er... maybe love
watchin' you leave the room.

317
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:47,494
Mr. Seaboldt. He maintained
a sense of humor.

318
00:21:49,504 --> 00:21:53,895
I think the sense of humor
is key. I don't posses it.

319
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:55,679
I mean, I do...

320
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:58,585
in a tragic sort of way.

321
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:00,315
Whatcha doin' here, Mr. Sea?

322
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:02,487
Uhm, filling in for
Dean Vargas.

323
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:04,387
Vargas is a bitch.

324
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:07,437
Talk shit, you get
slapped like a bitch.

325
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:09,488
You're not gonna get me
no detention neither.

326
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:12,488
I'm gonna un-fuck your shit
uptight, you motherfucker!

327
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:16,939
Un-shit... No, un-fuck
your shit uptight, motherfucker.

328
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:20,639
Wow! That is,
I mean, really poetic.

329
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,039
I mean, that's truly...
What, lyrical.

330
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,700
You should take that
on the stage.

331
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,261
I mean that shit sells itself.

332
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:31,889
Umm, hey who could talk
some of my thought says

333
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:36,012
I am going to un-fuck your
shit uptight, motherfucker.

334
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,683
I'll tell you what I will do, laddy.

335
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:40,403
I'll un-fuck your shit uptight.

336
00:22:40,853 --> 00:22:44,944
And un-fuck it right uptight
up your ass, you motherfucker.

337
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:53,595
I'm going to un-fuck your shit
uptight, you motherfucker!

338
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,211
I'll tell what, um...

339
00:22:55,216 --> 00:22:57,946
Why don't you have a seat,
OK? And then I'll...

340
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,647
I'll back shortly and we'll
discuss your bright future.

341
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:02,224
Okay, my man?

342
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:04,117
I mean, my motherfucker.

343
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:07,458
Okay, Mae West?

344
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:14,785
Ellen, can I see your nipples?

345
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,662
What? No!

346
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:18,569
Wrong.

347
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,230
See I... Actually I can.

348
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,120
See, that's the whole point,
you have to wear bra to school.

349
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,101
Look Mr. Seaboldt,
I'm just being me.

350
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:28,101
I don't tell you how to dress,
so you don't tell me.

351
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:29,261
Capiche?

352
00:23:36,173 --> 00:23:37,953
Ellen, do you know
what that is?

353
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:42,074
It's a beautiful picture
of a sunset in Hawaii.

354
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:44,164
It's rather pretty, isn't it?

355
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:45,864
Now, Ellen.

356
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,685
Do you know what that is?

357
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:51,155
That's a vagina
infected with gonorrhea.

358
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:52,664
That's fucking grose.

359
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,895
Yes very. So, you see,

360
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:57,655
when you come to school
dressed like that, you give

361
00:23:57,656 --> 00:23:59,456
you give out the wrong signal.

362
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:01,157
Don't you want people
treat you with respect?

363
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:02,357
Yo! I get respect.

364
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,257
I don't give it up to
every dick in my face.

365
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:07,588
Every "dick" in your face.

366
00:24:08,718 --> 00:24:10,939
That's respectful.

367
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:16,358
Put this on.
Wear that for the rest...

368
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,410
Hey I said wear that
for the rest of the day.

369
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:21,052
Okay?

370
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,570
Can I go now?

371
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:25,421
I supposed you can, I mean.

372
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:28,442
If we're done.
Are we done?

373
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:31,622
- We're done.
- We're done.

374
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:34,033
Another student saved.

375
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:38,483
Come out of
the bathroom, grandma!

376
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:41,234
Come on Granma,
open the door.

377
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:46,275
Hi, grandpa.

378
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:49,005
Grandpa.

379
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:51,966
Grandpa.

380
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:54,208
You okay?

381
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:56,046
What is it, grandpa?

382
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:57,977
It's Henry, grandpa.

383
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:00,317
Grandpa, it's Henry.

384
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:02,876
- Who?
- Are you in pain?

385
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:06,178
No, no. I...
I pissed myself.

386
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:13,489
Come on, grandma,
open the door!

387
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:14,709
Excuse me

388
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:15,971
Excuse me

389
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,180
- Can you come in here please?
- We have a little accident?

390
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,361
- Yes
- You should... haa..

391
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:29,472
- Do you wanna? - No, no.
- See, we're taking care of it.

392
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:30,762
See? You're okay.

393
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:34,983
- You right?
- Are you doin' any writing, grandpa?

394
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:36,474
In journals?

395
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:38,511
No, my life...

396
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:43,054
My life isn't worth memoires.

397
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:45,705
It's ok, it's okay.

398
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:49,815
I didn't wanna to go
out like this.

399
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:52,986
I hate being a burden.

400
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:54,735
You're not a burden.

401
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:56,064
Okay?

402
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:58,156
You're not a burden.

403
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:03,468
Sure. You...
You like coming here, eh?

404
00:26:04,768 --> 00:26:08,069
Your mother came by today.

405
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,789
Have you spoken to her lately?

406
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:13,379
No.

407
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,070
Now, you tell her
I'm fine?

408
00:26:20,771 --> 00:26:25,482
You always say you're fine, but
I know you hide things from me.

409
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:27,872
You've always been closed off.

410
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:30,702
Ever since you were a kid.

411
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:32,549
Why is that?

412
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:37,147
Why?

413
00:26:39,024 --> 00:26:42,985
Ah, you're upset. I shouldn't
say these things to you...

414
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:46,485
- I don't mean to make you...
- You haven't upset me, grandpa.

415
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:49,576
It's that I don't wanna
talk about the past.

416
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:53,536
You and I remember it
very differently.

417
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:57,967
Get rest, O.K?
Close your eyes. I'm here.

418
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:03,488
- I am in here with you
- When you stop coming, Henry

419
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:05,408
I'll die.

420
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,909
Fuck.

421
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:51,396
You got a smoke?

422
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:54,867
No, I don't have a smoke.

423
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:57,487
Where did you go, eh?

424
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:01,828
- What are you gonna do now?
- What are you gonna do, little kid?

425
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:03,318
I don't know.

426
00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:07,879
Can you lend me ten bucks?

427
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,300
Come on, man I'm hungry.

428
00:28:22,342 --> 00:28:26,372
I may have something
to eat at my place.

429
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,030
Come in, wash your hands.

430
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:45,565
There's soap over there.

431
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:01,558
Sit down.

432
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:07,659
Really nice place you got.

433
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:19,111
Thanks.

434
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:26,582
- You got anything stronger?
- Eat your sandwich.

435
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:50,097
Hey, hold on man!

436
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:53,097
- It's a 100 bucks.
- Relax...

437
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:23,952
What?

438
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:29,513
- Have you been raped recently?
- What do you care?

439
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:33,774
I'm not sure
that I do particularly.

440
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,905
Find and put something on it.

441
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:51,397
Look, I gotta get back.

442
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:52,679
Back?

443
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:54,117
Back where?

444
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:56,147
Listen, buddy,

445
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,828
If you don't got the
money it's cool. I mean,

446
00:30:58,878 --> 00:31:00,138
I like you.

447
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,878
I'll blow you for 50?

448
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:02,928
Listen to me,

449
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,789
knock off the bullshit, okay?

450
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,360
Come in the bathroom.

451
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:28,953
It's gonna sting a little bit.

452
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:32,644
Why are you doing this?

453
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:36,341
Take a shower

454
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:39,505
- This is fresh towel.
- Thanks.

455
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,391
Go to sleep.

456
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:09,502
Hello, this is Dr. Parker

457
00:33:09,503 --> 00:33:12,901
My son's ADHD and I looked it up
online, and that's what he's got.

458
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:14,381
Now you gotta
give him a free laptop.

459
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:15,982
Mr. Kevin, your son Oliver
injured a student.

460
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:19,902
His problems are behavioral.

461
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:22,902
Hey, my kid's got a disability
and he's not learning anything,

462
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,083
and this is your fault!

463
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:25,853
Hey, hey...
What are you doing?

464
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:28,253
What is the matter with you?

465
00:33:28,254 --> 00:33:30,554
As it is, our resources emaciated.

466
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:33,575
Now, I heave real LD kids
that need my attention.

467
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:37,655
He's always mad all the time because
he's not getting the services he needs.

468
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:40,005
No Child Left Behind
promises me my rights.

469
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:45,007
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
- Mr...

470
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:28,104
Hey, what are you doing?
What is this?

471
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:36,115
What is this? Funny? Get to
class. Get to class right now.

472
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:39,866
What's the joke?
I don't get the joke. Huh?

473
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:42,366
Is this funny? Does that
look good to you?

474
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:46,267
You like hurting animals? Huh?!
Is that what you like to do?

475
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,407
Answer me! You like hurting
animals? You like this?!

476
00:34:49,408 --> 00:34:52,978
Come here. Go.
Let’s go. Come on.

477
00:34:53,088 --> 00:34:55,159
Walk

478
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,870
Mr. Raymond, the studies
have shown that kids

479
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,421
who are prone to hurting
animals at an early age

480
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:09,561
eventually fall into a
high percentage of adults

481
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:14,072
who may fail to develop even
the most basic feeling for people.

482
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:15,822
Raven.

483
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,516
How do you feel about this?

484
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:22,286
I feel...

485
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,562
Trapped.

486
00:35:24,862 --> 00:35:26,924
Like the cat.

487
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:05,222
Fuck.

488
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:07,927
Who are you? Why?

489
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:10,532
Did you pay?
Did you pay her?

490
00:36:10,572 --> 00:36:13,622
- Yeah alright, here...
- Pay her!

491
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:17,773
- Alright, here, take...
- What are you paying me for, huh?!

492
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:19,233
It wasn't in my mouth!

493
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:23,174
Get fuck out of here.
Get out of here! Fuck!

494
00:36:25,414 --> 00:36:27,514
Don't hurt me!

495
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:35,921
Here...

496
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,867
Change your sheets!

497
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,009
How do you do it kid?

498
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,200
Please don't be mad at me.

499
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,540
I am not mad at you.

500
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,441
Don't think about
leaving me.

501
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:09,122
I won't do it anymore,
I promise.

502
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:11,202
You don't need to promise me.

503
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:15,453
Okay don't promise to me.

504
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:20,125
Whatever it is, you feel
you need to do, you do it.

505
00:37:20,403 --> 00:37:21,974
But you don't do it here!

506
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,584
Okay?

507
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,644
What are you doing there?

508
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:28,595
Don't you knock?

509
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:34,206
What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?

510
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:37,518
Why don't you paint
something cheerful?

511
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:40,206
Like happy with colors.

512
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:43,052
Whadya want from me dad, besides
for me to have been born with a penis.

513
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,231
I don't work all day

514
00:37:44,232 --> 00:37:47,398
to have my night ruined
by your teen angst.

515
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:51,299
Hopefully, it might get you a full-right to
Stanford if you were some minority...

516
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:55,679
I am not goin' to support you
and your little creative habits!

517
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,730
Okay? I've had it with all
of all your little art projects

518
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,629
that are going nowhere!

519
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,161
You always know
what to say, dad.

520
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:06,160
Now, if you cleared...

521
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,452
and lost some weight

522
00:38:11,862 --> 00:38:15,123
you could attract
a nice boys, who knows.

523
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:17,721
There should be

524
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:20,744
a prerequisite,

525
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:26,885
curriculum for being an parent,
before the people attempt to.

526
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,486
Don't try this at home.

527
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:38,007
Take these.

528
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:44,788
What are those?

529
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,228
You're supposed to ask me
before you take them.

530
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:49,689
They're vitamins,

531
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:50,949
and Aspirin.

532
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,682
At some point

533
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,200
you should get an HIV test.

534
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,891
At some point.

535
00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:17,293
Why are you crying on the bus?

536
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,145
Go to sleep.

537
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:49,685
A friend of yours?

538
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:51,379
A friend.

539
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:53,440
Oh... No, no...

540
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,150
Of course he had no friends,
he was a...

541
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,990
Total asshole.

542
00:39:59,512 --> 00:40:01,141
What was his problem?

543
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:04,932
He chose a vocation that
did not choose him.

544
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:06,882
And then he spent his
whole career

545
00:40:06,982 --> 00:40:10,152
"casting pearls before swine",
He talked like that...

546
00:40:11,763 --> 00:40:13,363
The child-hater, basically.

547
00:40:13,683 --> 00:40:18,674
He tried to purge Steinbeck and
Faulkner from required reading list.

548
00:40:18,754 --> 00:40:22,395
Well, let it be said from
the safety of his sabbatical,

549
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:26,035
You can do no more harm.

550
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:27,735
How did he die?

551
00:40:28,274 --> 00:40:30,606
Who knows, and who cares.

552
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:43,037
"Hello"

553
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:45,058
"It's drudgery, this life"

554
00:40:45,548 --> 00:40:47,156
"and retention"

555
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:49,428
"suspension, expulsion"

556
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:50,989
"staff meetings"

557
00:40:51,418 --> 00:40:52,918
"The Papers cuts"

558
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,247
"The vacant parents"

559
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,759
"Their vicious kids"

560
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,730
"They’re the dreads
of the pain"

561
00:40:57,731 --> 00:40:59,641
"They spat on my soul"

562
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:02,270
"This humiliation will stop"

563
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:06,421
"Discipline must be restored,
these kids have us on the run."

564
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,551
" We're the ones on trial!"

565
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,963
" It's fucking madness! "

566
00:41:11,293 --> 00:41:13,182
"Like every child has value? "

567
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:16,023
"Is a winner and worthy of
a private education"

568
00:41:16,024 --> 00:41:19,154
"Fucking kids who have
no desires,"

569
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:20,463
"no fire..."

570
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:22,035
"No minds to be..."

571
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,019
" Assimilate "

572
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,480
What does that mean?

573
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,030
To take something in.

574
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:55,711
OK, excellent. To absorb.

575
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,967
" Ubiquitous "

576
00:41:59,828 --> 00:42:01,505
Anyone?

577
00:42:04,242 --> 00:42:05,932
Everywhere, all the time.

578
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:08,593
So what...

579
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:12,623
"ubiquitous assimilation"

580
00:42:14,204 --> 00:42:17,604
Always absorbing everything
everywhere all the time.

581
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:19,553
Well done, George.

582
00:42:20,035 --> 00:42:22,425
How are you
to imagine anything,

583
00:42:22,815 --> 00:42:25,306
if the images are always
provided for you?

584
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:29,486
Who here had read
"1984" last year?

585
00:42:29,906 --> 00:42:30,957
Good.

586
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:37,467
Anyone?

587
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:39,358
Meredith.

588
00:42:39,508 --> 00:42:42,858
Having two opposing
beliefs at once.

589
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:44,539
Believing that both are true.

590
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:46,009
Excellent.

591
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:49,030
Why do you always suck
his dick, you fuckin' kiss-ass?

592
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,740
To deliberately believe in lies

593
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,701
while knowing they're false.

594
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,282
Examples of this
in everyday life:

595
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:02,032
Oh, I,

596
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:05,883
need to be pretty
to be happy.

597
00:43:07,363 --> 00:43:09,913
I need surgery
to be pretty.

598
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:13,023
I need to be thin

599
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:14,399
Famous

600
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,866
Fashionable

601
00:43:17,134 --> 00:43:18,795
Our young men,

602
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:21,615
today,

603
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:24,215
are being told that women

604
00:43:24,216 --> 00:43:25,695
are whores;

605
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:28,016
bitches, things to be screwed,

606
00:43:30,057 --> 00:43:31,457
beaten,

607
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:33,747
shit on,

608
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:36,088
ashamed.

609
00:43:37,098 --> 00:43:39,988
This is a marketing holocaust.

610
00:43:40,608 --> 00:43:41,899
24 hours a day,

611
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:43,859
for the rest of our lives,

612
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:46,279
the powers that be

613
00:43:46,379 --> 00:43:47,360
are hard at work

614
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,100
dumbing us

615
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,470
to death.

616
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:54,946
So, to defend ourselves

617
00:43:55,671 --> 00:44:01,182
and fight against assimilating this
dullness into our thought processes,

618
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:03,212
we must learn to read

619
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:05,753
to stimulate our own imagination;

620
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,213
to cultivate

621
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:10,213
our own consciousness,

622
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,044
our own belief system.

623
00:44:13,805 --> 00:44:15,493
We all need these skills

624
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:17,335
to defend

625
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:19,815
to preserve

626
00:44:23,316 --> 00:44:25,016
our own minds.

627
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:39,759
Very carefully, it's perfect.

628
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:41,829
Great.

629
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:44,019
Let me have a look.

630
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,880
You just made your own...

631
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,171
Wow. I don't care what
they say, you're doing great.

632
00:44:53,171 --> 00:44:55,211
I had hard time with
math too. It takes time.

633
00:44:56,101 --> 00:44:58,142
Wow, that is damn cool.

634
00:45:00,062 --> 00:45:01,682
Hi guys.

635
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:03,613
Thank you for staying late,

636
00:45:04,163 --> 00:45:06,233
all 15 or 20 of you.

637
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:10,353
Today we'll be presented
with a new course work

638
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:14,373
engineered to boost
State exam performance,

639
00:45:14,374 --> 00:45:17,435
as mandated by
"No child had left behind".

640
00:45:23,496 --> 00:45:27,266
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure to be here.

641
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:30,746
I've come today with some
edifying materials

642
00:45:30,747 --> 00:45:35,007
to help your matriculating and
non matric students

643
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:38,249
to better prepare for the
upcoming State Exams this May.

644
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:39,934
Let me start by stating

645
00:45:39,939 --> 00:45:42,599
I love teachers.

646
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,830
I love what you do,

647
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,670
what you stand for.

648
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,731
You guys are the real heroes.

649
00:45:50,921 --> 00:45:53,721
Now, the one thing I've learned
in all my years in the private sector,

650
00:45:54,531 --> 00:45:55,622
is that

651
00:45:55,822 --> 00:45:59,032
real estate generates revenue

652
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:02,063
And burgeoning property values
will be this school's saving grades.

653
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:05,743
But your school's
low test scores

654
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:09,783
are bringing down the whole re-sale
value in this neighborhood

655
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:12,294
during the market already in decline.

656
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:14,925
We gotta get the scores up -

657
00:46:14,945 --> 00:46:16,965
new families in our district

658
00:46:18,685 --> 00:46:20,706
and more motivated
kids in the school.

659
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:23,145
And I am not placing any blame

660
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:26,046
Excuse me, are you here
to sell some tests material

661
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:29,387
or to air your concerns
as a property owner?

662
00:46:29,397 --> 00:46:32,438
Listen, umm... I am curious

663
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:35,448
Are you givin' away pop-corn with
this crap that you're pushing?

664
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:38,908
This faculty has spent their lives
on the boards, and now you tell us

665
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:42,400
that our careers are
about re-sale value.

666
00:46:42,404 --> 00:46:43,867
- Bullshit !
- Give him hell lady...

667
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,780
- Storm the game.
- Don't oversimplify it, ma’am.

668
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:47,348
That's a hazard you
can't afford.

669
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:48,641
This sounds like a threat.

670
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:50,190
Could you please sit down?

671
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:51,511
That's enough.
Could you please sit down?

672
00:46:51,512 --> 00:46:54,182
Can we have some
order here, please.

673
00:46:56,072 --> 00:46:57,742
Dr. Heart was right.

674
00:46:58,202 --> 00:47:00,732
- This school's the pride of the district.
- Can you get back, pal?

675
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:02,553
Could you finish your pitch,
we'd like to go home?

676
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:04,183
What's you hurry, hon?

677
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:06,974
I hear they're putting
you out to pasture...

678
00:47:07,254 --> 00:47:10,223
So enjoy running this relic
for a few more months.

679
00:47:10,224 --> 00:47:13,785
You're a fossil when
you're fucking done.

680
00:47:24,197 --> 00:47:26,597
You're dread going home?

681
00:47:27,797 --> 00:47:31,917
Frankly, I don't know what to do
with myself when I'm not in my classroom.

682
00:47:31,918 --> 00:47:35,569
So, Friday afternoons
I am afraid to go home.

683
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:38,389
Afraid of all that time alone.

684
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:41,690
Yeah.

685
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,981
My mother hates
my father passionately...

686
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:51,761
...watches a lot of TV

687
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:54,612
...the only time that I don't feel

688
00:47:54,892 --> 00:47:57,542
- I teach for selfish reasons...
- My mother was in Mac Madison

689
00:47:57,632 --> 00:47:59,212
...I need a control

690
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:01,902
I need those kids more than...

691
00:48:01,903 --> 00:48:04,142
It’s the moments in school...

692
00:48:04,143 --> 00:48:06,673
It must be like

693
00:48:06,674 --> 00:48:07,914
...best teacher I ever had...

694
00:48:13,215 --> 00:48:15,865
So what's your story?

695
00:48:16,368 --> 00:48:18,187
My story?

696
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:28,198
I'm just... I'm just taking
one thing at a time.

697
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:31,967
Why are you wasting your life, you know
something to dodge?

698
00:48:31,968 --> 00:48:34,339
I teach every day, I mean...

699
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:38,349
You don't really know me.

700
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,860
So what happened to you?

701
00:48:49,441 --> 00:48:52,052
You don't want something
more permanent?

702
00:49:09,924 --> 00:49:11,327
- Hi
- Where have you been?

703
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,255
What? I was out.

704
00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:18,356
- With a colleague.
- The boy or girl?

705
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:21,337
A woman.

706
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:26,218
You make me feel so stupid.
Why are you treating me like a kid?

707
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:29,778
Because you're a kid.

708
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:34,319
I am sorry.
I wasn't expecting this.

709
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:37,829
All you had to do was tell me
you were gonna be home later.

710
00:49:37,869 --> 00:49:39,660
Back up, alright?

711
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,380
I'm not beholden to you, okay?

712
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:49,381
I mean, you're welcome
to stay here, but

713
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:52,172
you know, you don't get to
have expectations of me, alright?

714
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:56,313
This is a temporary thing, you...
you're able to stay here, but...

715
00:49:56,513 --> 00:49:58,523
eventually you're gonna
have to go, you understand?

716
00:49:58,873 --> 00:50:00,743
- I think it is important...
- It's clear.

717
00:50:01,494 --> 00:50:03,154
I get it, you want
me to go now?

718
00:50:03,614 --> 00:50:06,844
I got better to do
than clean up the stuff.

719
00:50:10,245 --> 00:50:12,295
I can't believe you made dinner.

720
00:50:12,815 --> 00:50:14,396
With what?

721
00:50:14,896 --> 00:50:18,856
Goceries, from the goceries store.

722
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:26,238
Wow, it's really nice kid.

723
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:30,919
It's been long time since
somebody cooked me.

724
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:33,279
Thank you Erica.

725
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,128
We all have problems, we all
have things that we're dealing with.

726
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:41,166
And we all...

727
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:46,231
Take them home with us at night,

728
00:50:46,931 --> 00:50:50,032
take them to work
with us in the morning.

729
00:50:56,063 --> 00:51:04,354
I think that helplessness, that
realization, that foreboding of

730
00:51:05,454 --> 00:51:10,825
being a drift in the sea,
with no

731
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:16,876
no bowie, no safety, when you
thought you'd be the one.

732
00:51:17,947 --> 00:51:20,237
throwing the bowie.

733
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,230
Hi...

734
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,380
- Anything for dinner?
- Tell me all about it from the beginning -

735
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:47,292
- You don't care.
- Oh no...

736
00:51:47,392 --> 00:51:49,202
So untrue, love.

737
00:51:50,372 --> 00:51:52,933
You are so condescending.

738
00:51:56,943 --> 00:51:58,153
Give me a kiss.

739
00:52:00,914 --> 00:52:05,465
Come on.
We'll solve everything.

740
00:52:05,835 --> 00:52:07,405
- Come on
- Stop it.

741
00:52:15,296 --> 00:52:21,317
Do you remember when
I bought you this?

742
00:52:24,988 --> 00:52:27,248
The beautiful summer in Venice

743
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:33,319
before our travels were
resigned to reviving old passions.

744
00:52:56,723 --> 00:52:58,544
" You suck! "

745
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:00,540
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

746
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:40,231
- Grandpa, you doing any writing of your journal?
- No...

747
00:54:41,441 --> 00:54:44,032
I don't remember much.

748
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:50,802
I lost the habit. You
can't think in this place.

749
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:53,303
You can't make new memories.

750
00:55:12,557 --> 00:55:13,787
Thank you.

751
00:57:10,017 --> 00:57:11,836
- You alright?
- What?

752
00:57:12,712 --> 00:57:15,514
- You see me?
- You see me standing here?

753
00:57:15,814 --> 00:57:17,690
Yes, I see you.

754
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:24,859
Oh God, it’s so relentless.
Thank you.

755
00:57:45,593 --> 00:57:47,953
"Carol, there is no nice way
for me to do this."

756
00:57:47,993 --> 00:57:50,774
"I spoke with the Superintendent"

757
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:53,683
"He's agreed to let you
out the rest of the year "

758
00:57:53,684 --> 00:57:55,805
" It is where it is."

759
00:57:55,905 --> 00:58:01,045
"Take your pension
and go to that beautiful house of yours."

760
00:58:07,087 --> 00:58:11,386
Haven't you ever had enough.

761
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:14,497
Haven’t' you ever just wanted
to tell someone to fuck off.

762
00:58:14,498 --> 00:58:16,778
I think I am sick.

763
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:19,738
- Why?
- I crossed the line today.

764
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:23,969
I mean the whole...
the whole thing is fucked.

765
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,900
Whole thing is fuck,
is it not?

766
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:30,149
What's up, Dr. Parker?

767
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:32,791
Can we get over it?
I got shit to do.

768
00:58:35,671 --> 00:58:39,052
What are your plans after High School
since you're not going to college?

769
00:58:39,322 --> 00:58:40,782
I don't know.

770
00:58:40,992 --> 00:58:45,783
Hanging out with my boyfriend.
Do some modeling shit...

771
00:58:47,203 --> 00:58:50,103
- Be in my friend's band.
- I have your 10-week grade report

772
00:58:50,104 --> 00:58:51,034
Do you know what it says?

773
00:58:51,038 --> 00:58:52,993
Fail, Fail, Fail

774
00:58:53,224 --> 00:58:55,125
- F, F, F
- F, F, F yah.

775
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:57,775
You know what that means?
It mean you don't care.

776
00:58:57,779 --> 00:58:59,347
You're brilliant.

777
00:59:03,147 --> 00:59:05,332
Can I go now?

778
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,967
Oh god, you are a shallow
disgusting creature.

779
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:16,307
You want to know the truth?
One, you're not gonna be in a band

780
00:59:16,308 --> 00:59:19,779
or an Model Missy,
because you have no ambition.

781
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,089
With no skills, you'll be competing

782
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:24,949
with the 80% of the U.S. workforce
for a minimum wage job

783
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:26,630
which you'll work at
for the rest of your life

784
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:28,599
till you're replaced by a computer.

785
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,410
- I don't care
- Two...

786
00:59:30,411 --> 00:59:33,791
The only talent you'll ever have
is getting men to fuck you.

787
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:36,370
Your life will basically
become a carnival of pain.

788
00:59:36,371 --> 00:59:37,842
Now, when you can't stand it

789
00:59:37,843 --> 00:59:41,333
not one more day,
not one more hour,

790
00:59:42,563 --> 00:59:45,623
it will get worse,
much worse!

791
00:59:47,194 --> 00:59:52,485
Every day I come into this office and
listen to your kids shit all over yourselves!

792
00:59:53,785 --> 00:59:58,796
It's so easy to be careless. It takes
courage and character to take care.

793
00:59:59,206 --> 01:00:02,036
Not that you have any
of those qualities.

794
01:00:03,996 --> 01:00:08,117
- Get out! Just get out! Get out!
- Fuck You!!!

795
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:15,799
- I am a total burn out.
- You are not.

796
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:19,859
- I am.
- I mean I don't know how you make it through the day.

797
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:24,129
Listen, seriously why do you
think I take these pills for?

798
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,800
I mean, that's a rubber room in here.

799
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:32,111
If I didn't take these things I'd be
committing mass murder.

800
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:35,130
and I'll be helping throwing their
fucking kids out of the window.

801
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,166
Come on, you're the best.

802
01:00:38,286 --> 01:00:40,921
I'll tell you my opinion, the worst
thing about this job

803
01:00:41,863 --> 01:00:43,963
is that nobody says thank you.

804
01:00:45,634 --> 01:00:46,604
- No.
- No.

805
01:00:47,614 --> 01:00:50,014
I'm here to say thank you.

806
01:00:50,434 --> 01:00:52,175
You're doing the job,
that none of us can do.

807
01:00:52,176 --> 01:00:53,793
None of us.

808
01:00:54,905 --> 01:01:00,395
- Grace?
- Have I ever I told you that you're the only person

809
01:01:00,396 --> 01:01:02,777
I have to talk to.

810
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:13,485
- Hi Henry
- What happened?

811
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,619
They called to your house.

812
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:19,649
- Your grandfather felt some chest pains.
- Yeah?

813
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:22,450
The Doctor says he's stable.

814
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,000
He doesn't have a lot of time.

815
01:01:27,793 --> 01:01:30,039
- I am so sorry Henry
- How long...

816
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:31,211
...have you been here?

817
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:34,202
Since this morning, I didn't know
how to get a hold of you?

818
01:01:34,622 --> 01:01:37,142
I don't know where you work.

819
01:01:37,672 --> 01:01:40,353
You've been here
all day with him?

820
01:01:48,754 --> 01:01:50,985
Hi, Grandpa.

821
01:01:51,415 --> 01:01:53,715
You're still hanging
in there, I see.

822
01:01:54,785 --> 01:02:00,496
Oh, hi sweetheart. Your mother
was with me today.

823
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:03,966
Did you see her?

824
01:02:06,737 --> 01:02:11,568
- No.
- I told her I was afraid to leave you.

825
01:02:12,548 --> 01:02:15,268
...but she promised

826
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:19,820
that she'd look after you.
- Well, I'm sure she meant that.

827
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:25,071
Patricia, darling...

828
01:02:26,238 --> 01:02:29,155
You've forgiven me, haven't you?

829
01:02:38,483 --> 01:02:43,024
What do you need to be
forgiven for, daddy?

830
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:47,115
Well, those things.
You know, the things I did.

831
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:53,365
All you ever did
was take care of me.

832
01:02:54,426 --> 01:02:58,386
- Always looked after me.
- Weren't you afraid of me?

833
01:02:59,156 --> 01:03:03,187
No, daddy, not.

834
01:03:03,191 --> 01:03:07,367
I know how you get sometimes
you get little mixed up.

835
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:13,419
You feel responsible for the
things that you didn't do.

836
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:16,699
So I wasn't the one
that hurt you?

837
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:21,429
No sir, that wasn't you.

838
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,001
I hope it wasn't true.

839
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:31,422
Patricia, darling.
I've always loved you.

840
01:03:34,482 --> 01:03:44,964
Daddy, you can feel free to leave,
whenever you're ready.

841
01:03:46,845 --> 01:03:51,405
Do you know that?
That's okay.

842
01:03:52,015 --> 01:03:54,966
There is nothing to fear.

843
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:10,419
Come on.

844
01:04:10,879 --> 01:04:13,889
Let's get outta here.

845
01:04:15,569 --> 01:04:22,611
Is Patricia your mom?
What happened to her?

846
01:04:23,261 --> 01:04:24,791
She left a while ago.

847
01:04:25,749 --> 01:04:27,342
You mean she died?

848
01:04:32,112 --> 01:04:35,573
How did she die?

849
01:04:38,293 --> 01:04:42,534
My father left when I was a kid.
I don't really remember him.

850
01:04:44,354 --> 01:04:48,564
It was always the three of us,
mother and grandpa and I together

851
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:51,156
in his house.

852
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:57,487
I found her... on the floor.

853
01:05:02,157 --> 01:05:04,458
She'd taken enough pills...

854
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:13,189
and grandpa at that moment,
kinda of lost it...

855
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:14,960
* For Henry *

856
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:17,880
I sat with grandpa
on the porch, and

857
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:22,931
and we watched as they
came and took her away.

858
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:25,149
How old were you?

859
01:05:29,222 --> 01:05:32,553
Seven.

860
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,683
I don't know for sure,
but I...

861
01:05:37,884 --> 01:05:42,204
think my mother was young
when something happened.

862
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:46,885
with her and grandpa.
- Were you afraid of it?

863
01:05:47,205 --> 01:05:48,425
No.

864
01:05:49,926 --> 01:05:53,436
Did she ever say
anything to you?

865
01:05:56,607 --> 01:05:58,207
No.

866
01:05:59,207 --> 01:06:04,608
But looking back on it, I think she
protected me in her own way.

867
01:06:05,392 --> 01:06:06,647
How?

868
01:06:10,479 --> 01:06:13,700
She made me lock
my door at night.

869
01:06:40,624 --> 01:06:44,295
The park is now empty and bare,
with an abandoned chain

870
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:50,136
The jungle Jim, the slide and
swing have rusted together.

871
01:06:51,406 --> 01:06:53,977
They're all so terribly alone now.

872
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,297
Where did all the children go?

873
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:59,397
Didn't they know that
the park needed them?

874
01:07:00,658 --> 01:07:05,338
The child's intelligent heart can find 'em
in the depth of many dark places.

875
01:07:07,499 --> 01:07:10,739
I cannot find 'em, the delicate
moment of its own detachment.

876
01:07:26,552 --> 01:07:29,263
- Hi Mr. Barthes.
- Hello Meredith.

877
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,374
- How's going?
- Fine, I am alright...

878
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:37,194
I made a picture for you.

879
01:07:37,774 --> 01:07:39,064
Come here.

880
01:07:40,104 --> 01:07:42,175
- You did?
- Yeah

881
01:07:49,286 --> 01:07:54,717
Wow, it's beautiful, and it's a...
You're really talented.

882
01:07:55,547 --> 01:07:57,257
Thanks. Have you been
doing this for a long time?

883
01:07:57,258 --> 01:08:00,268
Yeah, I've been doing it
since I was a kid.

884
01:08:01,888 --> 01:08:04,439
Faceless man in an empty room.

885
01:08:04,649 --> 01:08:06,269
Is that how you see me, Meredith?

886
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,840
I don't know how I see you.

887
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:14,410
It's just how thought
of you in a situation.

888
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:18,021
Do you ever think about who
your teachers are outside?

889
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:21,011
- In real life?
- I guess so.

890
01:08:22,152 --> 01:08:25,732
- Does this place seem unreal to you?
- I watched you around the school,

891
01:08:27,222 --> 01:08:29,320
You always seem so sad

892
01:08:31,183 --> 01:08:38,684
Maybe you have a hard time with things
and you need someone to talk to

893
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,575
- Meredith
- Yes Sir

894
01:08:49,411 --> 01:08:53,617
- Do you need someone to talk to?
- Yes, will you talk to me?

895
01:08:56,107 --> 01:09:00,398
When you talk to me, when you look
at me, it's like you really see me.

896
01:09:00,948 --> 01:09:03,309
I do see you Meredith

897
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:06,569
Do you wanna go
see Dr. Parker?

898
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:09,218
Oh, come on, don't blow me
off to the guidance counselor.

899
01:09:09,219 --> 01:09:11,148
I am not, I am not...

900
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,361
What can I do?

901
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:18,520
It's like you said, we're...

902
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:22,641
There is nothing left. Nothing but
to realize how fucked up things are...

903
01:09:22,642 --> 01:09:26,343
It's not enough. I won't last.

904
01:09:27,073 --> 01:09:29,773
Listen to me. Just listen.

905
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:34,774
We're all the same.

906
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:37,325
We all feel pain.

907
01:09:37,345 --> 01:09:43,036
We all have chaos
in our lives.

908
01:09:43,886 --> 01:09:46,446
Life is very, very
confusing, I know.

909
01:09:46,846 --> 01:09:50,667
I don't have the answers,
but I know if you write it out

910
01:09:51,757 --> 01:09:54,207
It'll all be okay.

911
01:09:55,098 --> 01:09:59,378
- Mr. Barthes, do you like me?
- Of course I do.

912
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,120
Meredith, please don't.
You know I'd like to help you.

913
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,771
- Please, please.
- No, no.

914
01:10:13,871 --> 01:10:17,211
- You don't...
- You said you liked me, please...

915
01:10:18,222 --> 01:10:19,342
Please, please...

916
01:10:19,402 --> 01:10:21,961
Oh please,
don't push me away.

917
01:10:21,962 --> 01:10:26,162
Please, just hold on to me, and tell
me that everything's gonna be O.K.

918
01:10:26,163 --> 01:10:28,803
Everything is...
It is okay, please.

919
01:10:34,704 --> 01:10:39,145
- Please... no, no...
- Meredith, wait a second.

920
01:10:39,915 --> 01:10:41,966
- What's going on?
- What?

921
01:10:42,346 --> 01:10:43,886
- Meredith, Meredith
- What were you just doing?

922
01:10:44,426 --> 01:10:45,929
Meredith, I am sorry.

923
01:10:47,108 --> 01:10:48,559
- What were you doing?
- What?

924
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,077
What are you doing?

925
01:10:51,277 --> 01:10:53,488
- Excuse me?!
- You were just touching her.

926
01:10:53,758 --> 01:10:55,498
What do you... what are
you insinuating?

927
01:10:55,499 --> 01:10:58,387
It is inappropriate to be in here
alone with that young girl.

928
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:00,779
It is inappropriate?!
She needed someone to talk to.

929
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:04,209
- What do you think I'm doing, lady?
- I don't know what you're doing.

930
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,850
"Just make me close."

931
01:11:05,851 --> 01:11:08,400
What do you think I am fucking pervert?
Is that what you're insinuating?

932
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,430
She needed someone
to talk to her.

933
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:13,771
- Than why were you touching her?
- I wasn't touching her.

934
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:15,591
"It's alright my dear."

935
01:11:18,312 --> 01:11:19,842
"Patricia?"

936
01:11:20,181 --> 01:11:22,726
I'm not... not a sick old man!

937
01:11:24,143 --> 01:11:26,173
Is that what you
think of me?

938
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:29,854
Is that what you think?

939
01:11:31,044 --> 01:11:33,724
I just wanted to help her!

940
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,014
- Get out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
- What am I supposed to think?

941
01:11:43,146 --> 01:11:45,236
You're supposed to...
Fuck into a fucking judgment!

942
01:12:02,189 --> 01:12:05,576
Hello, no he's not home.

943
01:12:29,704 --> 01:12:31,754
Hello Mr. Barthes.

944
01:12:33,985 --> 01:12:39,996
Whenever you feel like you are ready
we do have some paperwork downstairs

945
01:12:40,236 --> 01:12:42,056
that we need you to
take care of.

946
01:12:47,805 --> 01:12:49,403
I am sorry.

947
01:13:34,765 --> 01:13:37,766
I wish things were different.

948
01:13:38,936 --> 01:13:46,327
I tried, you know... Fuck...
The things is... We all...

949
01:13:51,178 --> 01:13:53,928
We all have problems. We all
have things that we're dealing with.

950
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:57,968
Some days were better than others.
Some days were not so great.

951
01:13:57,969 --> 01:14:02,770
Some days we have
limited space

952
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,730
for others.

953
01:14:20,463 --> 01:14:23,293
Hey. I made breakfast.

954
01:14:24,403 --> 01:14:26,252
Want some milk?

955
01:14:28,644 --> 01:14:32,705
These kids need something else.

956
01:14:35,044 --> 01:14:37,141
They don't need me.

957
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,997
- Are you O.K?
- Yeah, I'm not hungry.

958
01:14:56,169 --> 01:15:00,400
You know, you can't
keep living on the street.

959
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:03,249
I am not. I mean, I'm staying
here with you.

960
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:06,201
You can't continue
to stay here with me.

961
01:15:06,571 --> 01:15:09,291
- I'm not good for you.
- That's not true.

962
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:13,282
You're the only family
I've ever had.

963
01:15:13,872 --> 01:15:16,092
Well, I can't be your family.

964
01:15:23,164 --> 01:15:26,214
I can't give you what you need.

965
01:15:35,276 --> 01:15:38,336
- You have to understand, you should be...
- You are good...

966
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,174
And gentle...

967
01:15:42,607 --> 01:15:44,687
You're the most kind.

968
01:15:49,768 --> 01:15:52,769
I love you Henry.

969
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,240
- Come in. -Hi.
- Hi.

970
01:16:03,411 --> 01:16:04,651
Hello there.

971
01:16:06,211 --> 01:16:10,182
- Erica...
- Don't let them take me...

972
01:16:10,282 --> 01:16:11,722
Please...

973
01:16:13,112 --> 01:16:15,203
- Noo...
- Listen, you should...

974
01:16:15,303 --> 01:16:19,113
You are all
that I have, please...

975
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:23,133
- Don't let me go.
- You should go, sorry.

976
01:16:23,134 --> 01:16:25,969
- No, no...
- No, don't do this...

977
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:27,681
- Henry! Henry!
- You should go

978
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:29,375
- Henry!
- You have to let go.

979
01:16:29,378 --> 01:16:31,451
- Henry!
- You have to...

980
01:16:32,386 --> 01:16:35,022
- Henry!
- You have to leg go now.

981
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,112
Henry!

982
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:39,627
- Her things?
- Yeah.

983
01:16:39,681 --> 01:16:42,554
- Henry! Henry!
- Come on.

984
01:16:44,328 --> 01:16:47,038
- No! No!...
- It's gonna be okay.

985
01:16:47,818 --> 01:16:49,647
Don't do this.

986
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:53,369
- You gonna be okay.
- No! No! No!

987
01:16:53,765 --> 01:16:56,419
No!...

988
01:17:45,298 --> 01:17:47,528
Well... I feel
just awful for her.

989
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,969
- For who?
- For our school.

990
01:17:51,819 --> 01:17:57,670
It may sound baroque but I've always
felt that the school had a spirit.

991
01:17:58,448 --> 01:18:02,052
It's not just a budgetful buildings,
but they're alive.

992
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,532
I just can't understand it.
Where are all the parents?

993
01:18:14,722 --> 01:18:16,258
I don't know.

994
01:18:21,914 --> 01:18:25,435
I was in my room for two
hours and saw one parent.

995
01:18:25,445 --> 01:18:27,445
Where are they?
Where is everybody?

996
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:30,446
- We don't know.
- It's uncanny.

997
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:34,316
No air raid sirens
No bombs.

998
01:18:34,546 --> 01:18:36,017
It doesn't happen that way.

999
01:18:36,547 --> 01:18:40,167
It starts in whisper,
then nothing.

1000
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:42,438
We had our music once,
didn't we?

1001
01:18:43,255 --> 01:18:44,547
Yes, we did.

1002
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:50,559
Do you remember those nights
we only had two parents at a time?

1003
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:53,220
And then there were more,
there were many more

1004
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,889
waiting in the waiting rooms.

1005
01:18:54,890 --> 01:19:00,111
And halls were full of joy and
celebration. Now, it's nothing.

1006
01:19:00,261 --> 01:19:03,951
Remembrance. The things passed.

1007
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:06,452
I actually felt quite at home.

1008
01:19:06,752 --> 01:19:08,322
There were no parents.

1009
01:19:09,062 --> 01:19:14,143
I thought how appropriate.
It was like, a moment of insight

1010
01:19:15,303 --> 01:19:19,554
the reality of the fucking
problem in the first place.

1011
01:19:24,585 --> 01:19:29,636
Some of us believe that
we can make a difference.

1012
01:19:30,706 --> 01:19:33,346
And sometimes we wake up

1013
01:19:36,277 --> 01:19:38,107
and we realize we've failed.

1014
01:19:50,069 --> 01:19:52,570
Hi it's Gretchen
calling from the Clinic,

1015
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:55,140
Erica Louis has her
test results back.

1016
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,217
Please give us a call
at your earliest convenience.

1017
01:19:58,218 --> 01:19:59,034
Thank you.

1018
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:27,283
" - You have good parents "
" - Bitch you shut up."

1019
01:20:27,284 --> 01:20:29,571
"A Mother of mine gave her..."

1020
01:20:30,071 --> 01:20:33,627
" A Diet Bitch! "
" ha ha... ha ha... ha ha"

1021
01:20:35,227 --> 01:20:37,447
" What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?"

1022
01:20:42,118 --> 01:20:44,765
" - I won't stand that, Dad! "
" - Paint something more cheerful..."

1023
01:20:44,925 --> 01:20:49,718
" We have to pay us our lives..."
" Grow like your hair, lost some weight"

1024
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:51,060
" It'll all be okay "

1025
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,429
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

1026
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:57,650
Before we take roll,

1027
01:20:57,651 --> 01:21:02,692
I want to tell you that today
will be my last day with you.

1028
01:21:03,742 --> 01:21:05,802
You're gonna have
a permanent teacher on Monday.

1029
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:08,553
- Where are you going, Mr. Barthes?
- I'll go to another school.

1030
01:21:09,983 --> 01:21:14,343
- We will miss you, man.
- Yeah?

1031
01:21:14,344 --> 01:21:17,104
All those teachers in
this place... They're dickheads.

1032
01:21:17,882 --> 01:21:20,627
Don't you get tired of
moving around all the time?

1033
01:21:20,825 --> 01:21:26,535
It's how my job works. I come
in here for a period of time,

1034
01:21:26,536 --> 01:21:28,566
so you don't have twenty
subs in and I'm outta here,

1035
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:33,577
and then, you have a
permanent teacher come in

1036
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,867
and I leave.

1037
01:21:37,638 --> 01:21:42,599
Attention to all teachers, this is an special
announcement from the Principal’s Office.

1038
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:46,819
There will an all faculty meeting
today, during nutrition"

1039
01:21:47,489 --> 01:21:50,249
Student nutrition will be extended

1040
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:53,500
a ten minutes, thank you.

1041
01:22:38,298 --> 01:22:43,829
I invited you here today
to discuss the state of things.

1042
01:22:44,349 --> 01:22:48,380
I know that there wasn't...
I know that there isn't...

1043
01:22:56,201 --> 01:22:59,892
- I am sorry...
- We all need something,

1044
01:23:00,492 --> 01:23:07,263
to distract us from the
complexity and reality.

1045
01:23:08,163 --> 01:23:11,064
More or less to think about
where that came from?

1046
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:18,465
No one wants to think about
the struggle that it takes

1047
01:23:18,495 --> 01:23:21,495
to become somebody
to get out of

1048
01:23:25,605 --> 01:23:27,440
...to get out of the...

1049
01:23:28,107 --> 01:23:30,807
the sea of pain that,
we all have to get out of.

1050
01:23:40,819 --> 01:23:42,409
- Hi Meredith.
- Hi.

1051
01:23:44,529 --> 01:23:46,560
Haven't seen you
in class lately?

1052
01:23:47,343 --> 01:23:48,868
Where have you been?

1053
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,801
- Baking.
- I see.

1054
01:23:52,971 --> 01:23:55,511
I am happy I get to see you.
Today is my last day.

1055
01:23:56,621 --> 01:23:59,282
How ironic!

1056
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:03,783
Listen, I was thinking,
I bought this for myself, but

1057
01:24:04,763 --> 01:24:09,044
maybe you could make
better use of it.

1058
01:24:20,966 --> 01:24:23,756
- I like that one the best.
- You can't have that one.

1059
01:24:24,256 --> 01:24:25,966
It's mine.

1060
01:24:27,497 --> 01:24:30,797
But, can you have this one?

1061
01:24:31,187 --> 01:24:33,688
- It's better for you anyway.
- Thanks.

1062
01:24:35,038 --> 01:24:36,678
I am sorry.

1063
01:24:38,299 --> 01:24:41,859
If I hurt you
in any way, I um...

1064
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:50,440
I know that it’s tough
right now, for you,

1065
01:24:50,441 --> 01:24:55,441
but it's not always gonna be this...
- Goodbye Mr. Barthes.

1066
01:25:00,062 --> 01:25:02,093
Goodbye Meredith.

1067
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:49,891
They say that suicide is a permanent
solution to the temporary problem.

1068
01:25:50,851 --> 01:25:52,721
I'll let you know?

1069
01:25:55,142 --> 01:25:58,662
My name is Meredith and
I wanted to kill myself.

1070
01:26:30,608 --> 01:26:32,228
Meredith!

1071
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:34,178
No!

1072
01:26:36,529 --> 01:26:38,379
Henry!

1073
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:44,150
It's gonna be O.K.
It's gonna be O.K.

1074
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:50,491
It's gonna be O.K.

1075
01:26:54,382 --> 01:27:02,683
We have such a responsibility to guide
our young so that they don't end up

1076
01:27:03,643 --> 01:27:06,304
falling apart.

1077
01:27:07,675 --> 01:27:09,564
Falling by the way side.

1078
01:27:12,871 --> 01:27:15,451
Becoming insignificant.

1079
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:39,639
I realized something today.

1080
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:47,161
I'm a non-person, Sarah.

1081
01:28:50,012 --> 01:28:56,073
You shouldn't be here.
I am not here.

1082
01:28:58,383 --> 01:29:01,073
You may see me,

1083
01:29:02,864 --> 01:29:07,865
but I'm hollow.

1084
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:45,601
Failing. We're failing.

1085
01:29:48,502 --> 01:29:55,313
Failed in a sense that we
have let everyone down.

1086
01:29:56,008 --> 01:29:57,857
Including ourselves.

1087
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:11,046
When you're walking down
the hallway, or in your classroom,

1088
01:31:11,546 --> 01:31:14,946
how many of you

1089
01:31:15,746 --> 01:31:22,018
have ever felt the weight
pressing down on you?

1090
01:31:23,628 --> 01:31:25,888
I have.

1091
01:31:29,319 --> 01:31:31,449
Everyone?

1092
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:33,580
Wow!

1093
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:37,850
Poe wrote about these
things over a 100 years ago.

1094
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:41,711
So, as we read

1095
01:31:41,961 --> 01:31:45,151
we can see that

1096
01:31:45,172 --> 01:31:48,552
"The House of Usher"
is not merely an old

1097
01:31:49,072 --> 01:31:51,983
decrepit castle in disrepair.

1098
01:31:53,313 --> 01:31:57,014
It is also a state of being.

1099
01:32:03,164 --> 01:32:07,284
"During the whole of dull,
dark and soundless day"

1100
01:32:07,519 --> 01:32:12,928
"In the autumn of that year, when the clouds
hung oppressively low in heavens,"

1101
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,813
"I had been passing alone,
on the horseback,"

1102
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:21,495
"Through the singularly
dreary tract of country;"

1103
01:32:22,357 --> 01:32:26,537
"and at length found myself as
the shades of evening dew on,"

1104
01:32:26,977 --> 01:32:30,101
"within view of the melancholy
House of Usher"

1105
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:33,781
