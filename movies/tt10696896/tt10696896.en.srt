3
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,982
Thank you
for making my Sonic your Sonic.

4
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,897
My name is McKayla.
How can I help you tonight?

5
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,857
I need a Footlong Cheese Coney
with mustard and onions,

6
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,989
large Tots
and a large Cherry Limeade.

7
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:55,218
We're on the road showing

8
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:58,743
real people the stain-fighting
power of OxiClean.

9
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:01,311
Thank you, Lord, for
this and many other blessings.

10
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:03,618
Please keep a watchful eye
over Ally.

11
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:06,011
In Jesus' name. Amen.

12
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:07,796
Do you
know how annoying that is?

13
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,841
Not to mention you could
blow out your eye that way.

14
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:44,702
- <i>Where you from?</i>
- <i>Stillwater.</i>

15
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,878
Who's the last drilling company
you worked for?

16
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:49,968
- ITA.
- Why'd you quit?

17
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,709
Operator dropped the rig.
We stacked.

18
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,711
I got laid off six months ago.

19
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:54,756
What are you doing now?

20
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,714
I work construction.

21
00:03:56,758 --> 00:04:00,065
But it's been slow
since the rig's been down.

22
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,199
I've been doing cleanup
after that tornado by Shawnee.

23
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,766
Getting after it.

24
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:16,952
Hey, Sharon.

25
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:19,041
Let me finish this page.

26
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,178
One more page.

27
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:29,312
Thank you for this food and for
all that is good in this world.

28
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:32,141
Keep Allison
in your watchful eye.

29
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:34,230
- Amen.
- Amen.

30
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,321
You get hired out yet?

31
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:40,845
Nope.

32
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,934
Had an interview this morning.

33
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,244
Got a call from your mother
a few days ago.

34
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,811
She moved to Tampa.

35
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,422
She ask for money or some shit?

36
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:53,423
No.

37
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,686
She asked about you.

38
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,341
You should call her sometime.

39
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,344
I got enough
I'm dealing with here.

40
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,827
Did you pick up
my car registration?

41
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,090
Yeah.

42
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,352
I got it at home.

43
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:11,180
Spent all morning
waiting for it.

44
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,794
Got it online.

45
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:18,666
Everything's online.

46
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,930
Can't get a real human being
if you try.

47
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:24,324
Didn't stop them
from charging me $23.

48
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,977
I'll pay it.

49
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,979
That's not what I meant.

50
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:29,677
I know.

51
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,813
<i>There's a bag of things</i>

52
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,902
<i>by the front door
for you to take.</i>

53
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:40,775
<i>And an envelope of photos
in on her desk.</i>

54
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,037
<i>Those are important.</i>

55
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:12,763
<i>Okay, you have two stopovers,</i>

56
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,983
the first in Atlanta,
the second in Frankfurt.

57
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,072
- You're at gate 22.
- Thank you.

58
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,948
I just need
your signature please.

59
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:12,301
- You are with us for two weeks?
- Yes, ma'am.

60
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,260
Thanks.

61
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:18,263
Here's your key. Room 156.

62
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,309
Thank you, ma'am.

63
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,225
Welcome back, Mr. Baker.

64
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,315
Hey.

65
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,495
<i>Oh, pardon.</i>

66
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,931
<i>Merci.</i>

67
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,087
Hey. Hey.

68
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,958
Y'all mind keeping it down?
I'm trying to sleep.

69
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:03,134
- The music.
- <i>Hein?</i>

70
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,268
No-no English.

71
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:07,574
No speak English.

72
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:08,966
Yeah, all right.

73
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,141
Hey, good night.

74
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,556
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- Baker.

75
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:01,541
<i>Salim, neuf.</i>

76
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,891
<i>Moussa, dix.</i>

77
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,633
<i>Baker, onze.</i>

78
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,038
<i>Merci.</i>

79
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:23,432
- Hey, baby girl.
- Hey, Dad.

80
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,696
You look good.

81
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,698
Thanks.

82
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,570
How was the flight?

83
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,963
Okay.

84
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,356
You doing all right?

85
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,619
- I'm okay, yeah.
- Good.

86
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,144
Good.
You got some laundry for me?

87
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,624
Yeah. Some.

88
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,365
I'll get it done.

89
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,413
They gave us
two more visiting days.

90
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:50,546
The next one's, uh, Friday,
2:00 p.m.

91
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,592
How's Gram?

92
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:53,723
She's good.

93
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,204
Still got the oxygen tank.

94
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:58,598
Still got plenty of opinions.

95
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:02,123
Miss her.

96
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,168
She bought you
everything you wanted.

97
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,648
Uh, we got you a extra pair
of socks

98
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:08,216
and, uh, good new pair
of sneakers.

99
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:11,001
Thanks.

100
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:14,178
Uh, Gram said that she was
giving you some photos for me.

101
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:16,659
Ah, shit. I forgot them.

102
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,269
Oh, just bring them next time.

103
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:20,445
No, I mean I forgot them
at home in Stillwater.

104
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,099
Sorry.

105
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:23,579
Doesn't matter.

106
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,451
I got you, uh, a Cowboys
sweatshirt at the airport.

107
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,105
They're gonna be good
this year.

108
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,543
They got this big ol' tight end
out of Guthrie.

109
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,458
Takes about three guys
to bring him down.

110
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,678
He gonna go pro for sure.

111
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,333
Cool.

112
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,205
You still working
at the library?

113
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,685
No, I quit.

114
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,645
Um, Dad, I need you
to do something.

115
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,170
I need you
to get that to Leparq,

116
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,650
make sure she reads it.

117
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,173
- Okay?
- Wh-What is it?

118
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:55,132
It's-it's a letter.
Just give it to her.

119
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,395
- Yeah, yeah.
- The-the address is on the envelope, okay?

120
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,788
Yeah, okay.

121
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:00,616
But are you good?

122
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,271
Dad, please.

123
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,142
I'll do it today.

124
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,535
I'll make sure she reads it.

125
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,276
Okay.

126
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:12,149
Mind if we pray a bit?

127
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,804
Yeah, sure, Dad.

128
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,373
Thank you, Lord,

129
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,070
for bringing us together
on this blessed day and

130
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:21,811
thank you for keeping
a watchful eye on Allison.

131
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,356
Mr. Baker.

132
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,315
I'm sorry you had to wait,
but Maître Leparq

133
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,752
is not coming back
to the office today.

134
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:51,711
I'll come back tomorrow, then.
Thank you, ma'am.

135
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,191
Mr. Baker,
she's in court all week.

136
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,540
Why don't you give me
your letter

137
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,238
and I will make sure
she gets it.

138
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,718
Can't do that.
Thank you, ma'am.

139
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,068
As you wish.

140
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,599
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- Hey.

141
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:20,609
You locked out?

142
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,264
<i>Quoi?</i>

143
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,701
Key. You got a key?

144
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,442
<i>Ah, euh, non.</i>

145
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,750
Come on, let's go get it.

146
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,537
Come on.
I'm gonna get you a new key.

147
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:45,808
Bell?

148
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,244
Bill.

149
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,419
Beal?

150
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:49,856
Closer.

151
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,248
What's your name?

152
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,424
- Hmm?
- You.

153
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:54,469
Maya.

154
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,863
Maya. Ah, that's nice.

155
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,648
<i>Ç'est quoi?</i>

156
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:02,651
It's a tattoo.

157
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:05,436
Hmm?

158
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,309
Oh, it's a eagle.

159
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:09,701
- Eagle?
- Eagle.

160
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,312
Bald eagle. America.

161
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:15,490
Yeah, and I got a skull
with a knife going through it.

162
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,710
- <i>Merci.</i>
- Thank you, ma'am.

163
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:23,628
<i>Merci.</i>

164
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,543
Thank you.

165
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:35,684
Afternoon. I'm looking for, uh,
for that person, Maître Leparq.

166
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,533
Ms. Leparq?

167
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,666
- Mr. Baker?
- Yes, ma'am.

168
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,972
I just need a few minutes
of your time.

169
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,670
Letter from my daughter.

170
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm sorry, Mr. Baker,

171
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:12,416
but I cannot honor
your daughter's request.

172
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,809
Why's that?

173
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,291
Mr. Baker, a judge
will not reopen this case

174
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:18,683
based on hearsay.

175
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,381
This is not possible.

176
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,731
Okay.

177
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:26,343
We have exhausted
every possible legal action.

178
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,519
This letter tells me
that your daughter

179
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,782
has not accepted her sentence.

180
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:31,871
And she must.

181
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,698
Do you understand?

182
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,961
Yes, ma'am.

183
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:36,701
I must go.

184
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,660
I have a full day.

185
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,662
Can I get that letter back?

186
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,882
As you wish.

187
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,753
- Thank you.
- Mr. Baker,

188
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:48,539
there's a time for hope and
there's a time for acceptance.

189
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,717
The last thing you want to give
your daughter is false hope.

190
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,937
That could make her situation
very dire.

191
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,026
Do you understand?

192
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,593
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:27,927
Hello.

194
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,581
Hey.

195
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,584
Uh, thank you for helping
my daughter Maya yesterday.

196
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:36,283
I was a little bit late
coming back.

197
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:38,589
It's, uh, you know,
we're between apartments,

198
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,592
and we don't have electricity
at our new place.

199
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:42,767
So...

200
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,813
Sorry, I...

201
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,336
I don't speak English.

202
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,470
Oh, yes.

203
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:51,602
The balcony. Yeah.

204
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:54,954
Um, well, my-my English
came back to me.

205
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,434
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry
for the loud noise.

206
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,045
It's because of
my girlfriend Nedjma.

207
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,960
She's a bad influence on me.

208
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,658
I'm, uh, Virginie.

209
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:04,789
I'm Bill.

210
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,400
Hello, Bill.

211
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,445
You're in Marseille
for vacation?

212
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,491
Uh, visiting my daughter.

213
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:11,666
It's cool.

214
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,104
Well, hopefully we're only here
for one or two more days,

215
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,802
but if you need anything,
you know, we're next door.

216
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,500
Thank you, ma'am.

217
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,589
Thank you. Bye, Bill.

Appreciate your help.

247
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,963
Please don't say anything
to anybody about this.

248
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:17,183
<i>Oui, bien sûr.</i>

249
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,890
Mr. Baker. Please, this way.

250
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,678
<i>So, how can I help you?</i>

251
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,942
Well, I want to see Mrs. Leparq
about the case.

252
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:40,119
Maître Leparq
is not available today.

253
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:45,733
There's a new lead.

254
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,517
This guy...

255
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,041
was talking at a party
about the murder.

256
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:52,174
- Mr. Baker...
- So somebody needs to talk to this teacher,

257
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,784
this guy, Patrick Okonedo.

258
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:55,743
We need to hear
what he has to say.

259
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:59,964
Mr. Baker, Maître Leparq was
very clear with you yesterday.

260
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,792
She cannot pursue this case.

261
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,795
But if you wish to pursue
a further investigation,

262
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,624
we can recommend this.

263
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:10,018
It's a list of private
detectives you can engage.

264
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,802
No, I don't want,
I don't want a detective.

265
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,804
We have worked with
the people on this list,

266
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:15,284
and they're all very capable.

267
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,199
I don't care how capable
they are. I don't want...

268
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,636
- I'm circling the names that you can...
- Stop circling that.

269
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,986
My daughter's in fucking jail.

270
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,945
I don't need some fucking list.

271
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,513
<i>Euh, ça va?</i>

272
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,124
<i>Oui, oui, ça va, oui.</i>

273
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:31,996
<i>Merci.</i>

274
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,176
As you want.

275
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,874
Fuck this.

276
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,198
<i>Merci, Sybille.</i>

277
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,938
- Hey. Mm.
- Hi.

278
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,028
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

279
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,248
Let you out a bit late today.
They shouldn't do that.

280
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,250
You know they're gonna
call you back in on time.

281
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,209
It's okay.
It happens sometimes.

282
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,211
- I did your laundry.
- Thanks.

283
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,691
Um, did you give
my letter to Leparq?

284
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,780
Yeah, of course.

285
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,305
And what'd she say?

286
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:25,049
Well, uh, she told me
what you wrote about Akim

287
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,704
- and the girl at the party.
- And what'd she say?

288
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,358
Well, she said, you know,

289
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,969
she works on
a lot of these cases...

290
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,971
Dad.

291
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:37,061
Is she gonna
investigate it or not?

292
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,107
Just tell me.

293
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,589
Yeah, she's gonna look into it.

294
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,243
Really?

295
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,246
She said that?

296
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,073
She said
she's gonna look into it?

297
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,988
That's right.

298
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,164
I told her how strongly
you felt about it.

299
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,602
Does she need me
to do anything?

300
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:59,780
No. She said she just needs
some time, and, uh...

301
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:03,262
She did say, uh, she didn't
want to make any promises.

302
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,308
She-she didn't want
to give you any false hope

303
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,831
- or nothing like that.
- No, no, no, no, no.

304
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,833
But that's-that's still great.

305
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,835
Akim exists.

306
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,402
He killed Lina.

307
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:14,795
I know.

308
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,753
I know that.

309
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,233
You have no idea how many times

310
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,191
I-I wrote and then rewrote
that letter.

311
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,410
Oh, my God.

312
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,107
Well, it worked.

313
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:24,892
Yeah.

314
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,981
Maybe God answered our prayers.

315
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,852
Thank you, Dad.

316
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,159
Thank you so much.

317
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:48,350
Excuse me, ma'am.

318
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:51,222
Bill Baker.
Called about a list.

319
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,181
One moment please.

320
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,096
<i>I don't know
how much you remember</i>

321
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,794
<i>about the case, but
Allison came here for college,</i>

322
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:00,188
<i>and that's where
she met this girl, Lina.</i>

323
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:02,408
<i>Allison and Lina were...
together,</i>

324
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:04,801
<i>and one night
they got in a big fight,</i>

325
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,803
and Allison went to a bar.

326
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,371
That's where she met
this Akim guy.

327
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:10,851
And they had some drinks.

328
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:13,332
He stole her purse, and...

329
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,377
when Allison got home,
she found Lina dead

330
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,248
and called the police.

331
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,207
And they never could find
this Akim.

332
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,775
He's the one who killed Lina.

333
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,865
What do you think?

334
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,434
Mm-hmm.

335
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,350
You speak English, right?

336
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,743
English?

337
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,702
Yes. I am.

338
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,052
Fuck.

339
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,316
Give me back the letter.

340
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,074
Mr. Baker.

341
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,251
Please.

342
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:05,166
My office.

343
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:09,083
I was in service
at the time of this case.

344
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,172
In the police.

345
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:13,479
Have you talked
to this Okonedo?

346
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,046
- The professor.
- No, sir.

347
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:20,877
I see why your lawyer
doesn't want to help.

348
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:24,185
Some kid at a party
hears gossip about a murder.

349
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,405
Maybe she remembers
this famous case.

350
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,233
Why now? It was five years ago.

351
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:33,020
That's... that's how long my
kid's been in jail, five years.

352
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,458
Does she know we are meeting?

353
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:37,894
Your kid.

354
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,374
No, sir.

355
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,426
Are you rich, Mr. Baker?

356
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,819
No, sir.

357
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,474
This is a DNA case.

358
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,302
It means two steps.

359
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:57,218
First, I look for
the young man.

360
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:59,002
That will not be easy.

361
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:02,223
People will talk.
He will try to disappear.

362
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,313
Then, if I find this Akim,

363
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:07,489
I have to get
a sample of his DNA

364
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:10,927
and use my connections
in the police to test it

365
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:13,321
against the DNA
from the crime scene.

366
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,237
How much?

367
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,899
$12,000?

368
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,814
Euros.

369
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:32,296
Thank you for your time.

370
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,299
Mr. Baker.

371
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:38,172
Do you believe
your daughter is innocent?

372
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,174
I know she is.

373
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:45,048
Then maybe it's not so much
to see her go free.

374
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,574
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

375
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:35,185
- Ask you a question, please?
- Yes, of course.

376
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:38,319
I'm just too much of a dumbass
to figure this out on my own.

377
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:39,581
I don't speak French.

378
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,975
Uh, how can I help you?

379
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,367
I'm looking for a guy,

380
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:45,413
<i>uh, who works here.</i>

381
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,605
- <i>Oui?</i>
- Sorry to interrupt.

382
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:06,434
Do you speak English?

383
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,482
I do.

384
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,441
Looking for Patrick Okonedo.

385
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,358
Have a seat please.

386
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,707
That's all right.
I'll wait outside.

387
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,623
No, no, please. Join the party.

388
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,640
It's impressive, huh?

389
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:44,080
It's the kind of office
a PhD will get you.

390
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,952
Mint tea.

391
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:50,086
I want to talk to the girl
you told Allison about

392
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,261
from the party.

393
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,524
Yes. I assumed as much.

394
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,267
To be honest, I've always felt
guilty about what happened.

395
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,269
I should've warned Allison.

396
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,184
Warned her? About what?

397
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:03,360
Well, I knew Allison and Lina
were sleeping together,

398
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:06,537
but I had no idea
Lina had moved in with her.

399
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:10,324
I try to not be cynical about
these type of relationships...

400
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,413
poor girl from the ghetto,
rich American student...

401
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,589
but then I end up
being guilty of naivete.

402
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,112
Allison grew up poor.

403
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,418
She isn't rich.

404
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,594
Educated.

405
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,466
There is a lot of resentments
towards the cultural elite.

406
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,251
But I'm sure
you're aware of that.

407
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:27,515
What about the girl
from the party?

408
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:28,777
- My student?
- Yeah.

409
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:30,692
Her name is Souad.

410
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:32,346
She's from
the outreach program,

411
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:33,608
the same one Lina and Allison

412
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,305
were involved with
when they met.

413
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,656
And she heard some guy
talking about Lina's murder?

414
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,441
This is what she told me.

415
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:42,312
Could I talk to her?

416
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,010
She'll talk to you, yes.

417
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:46,490
I'll give you her phone number.

418
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:50,669
Souad doesn't speak English
very well.

419
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,322
You will need someone
to translate.

420
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:55,108
Oh, could you do that for me?

421
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,676
No, I'd rather not.

422
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,201
I'm still running
the outreach program.

423
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,681
I cannot be associated with you.

424
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,684
Or your daughter,
after what happened.

425
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,555
Whatever my personal opinion
may be.

426
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,297
My daughter's innocent.

427
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:17,478
I wish you good luck.

428
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:31,100
Hey, Patricia,
afraid I need some help again.

429
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:34,103
I'm supposed to attend a
very special birthday tomorrow,

430
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,757
and I lost the address.

431
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,559
<i>Bonjour?</i>

432
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:56,822
Hi. It's Bill Baker.

433
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:58,780
<i>Pardon?</i>

434
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:01,783
- Bill, from the hotel.
- Ah, Bill.

435
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,393
Yeah, I was stopping by.
Sorry to...

436
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:06,788
- Uh, last floor.
- All right.

437
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,619
Hi, Bill.

438
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:13,795
Hey, Maya.

439
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,579
I got something for you.

440
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:17,581
It's a robot.

441
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,721
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry to intrude.

442
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,462
No, it's okay. Come in.

443
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,552
Um, I have some friends over.

444
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,249
Oh.

445
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:34,773
How did you find us?

446
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,775
Oh, the lady at reception
gave me your address

447
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,559
'cause there's this girl
I need to call,

448
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:41,823
but she don't speak English,
and it's kind of personal.

449
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,825
Ah, you want me to make the
call for you. Is that right?

450
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,261
Yes, ma'am, but I'll come back
another time.

451
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,133
No, it's fine.
Uh, just come in.

452
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,830
Just let me grab my phone.

453
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,484
Come.

454
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,793
Hey.

455
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,707
Bill, this is, uh,

456
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:59,406
the crème de la crme
of the Marseille theater scene.

457
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,715
<i>Ouais.</i>

458
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,632
Uh, we're doing
this, uh, mask exercise.

459
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:09,808
- All right.
- Yeah.

460
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,593
Excuse the mess.

461
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,334
This is going to be my office,
but we're still moving in.

462
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,205
Have a seat.

463
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:17,554
So, who am I calling?

464
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:19,295
Um...

465
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:21,254
the girl from the letter.

466
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:23,865
- Ah, it's about the case?
- Yes, ma'am.

467
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,606
I want to meet with her.

468
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,869
Is the lawyer not helping you?

469
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:30,872
Uh, doing it myself for now.

470
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,874
Oh. Wow.

471
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,354
Okay. Um...

472
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,185
- <i>Oui.</i>
- Um...

473
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:46,975
What a great deal,
I got this place

474
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:49,456
through this friend of mine.

475
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:53,286
I fell in love with this view,
but, uh, has a few defects.

476
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,810
Probably just
a circuit breaker.

477
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,420
I could look at it if you want.

478
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,945
- Yeah. You know how to do that?
- Yes, ma'am.

479
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:02,338
Well, that would be great.

480
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:04,471
Souad? Souad?

481
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,212
<i>Oui, bonjour. Souad?</i>

482
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,213

484
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,437
Bill Baker...

485
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,222
<i>Oh, non.</i>

486
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,705
Let me see. Let me see.

I didn't know it did that.

490
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:44,554
That-that goes on easy.
Hold on. There you go.

491
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:45,947
Looks good.

492
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:48,907
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

493
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,039
<i>Au revoir.</i>

494
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:54,608
Okay. She agrees to see you
tomorrow at 6:00.

495
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:56,566
All right.

496
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,394
Um, she was nice.

497
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,266
Bit shy.

498
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,268
So how are you gonna talk to
her if you don't speak French?

499
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:04,923
Well, that's a fair question.

500
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,968
I'll figure it out.

501
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,578
Okay.

502
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,580
Well, I could come
and translate if you need.

503
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,452
You sure?

504
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:14,584
Uh, yeah.

505
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:17,848
Yeah, Maya has art class,
so if you come here at 5:30,

506
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:19,502
then we take my car.

507
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,852
Appreciate it.

508
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,289
Uh, you show me
where that fuse box is,

509
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,507
I'll work on
that breaker for you.

510
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,292
No, it's okay.

511
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:27,684
You don't have to do that.

512
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,382
<i>Oh, non, non.</i>

513
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,776
Just give me that damn thing.
I... Come on.

514
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,478
Bill!

515
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:42,351
Bye, Bill!

516
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,485
Bye.

517
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,801
<i>I have to confess,
uh, I went online and I read</i>

518
00:32:57,845 --> 00:32:59,673
about Allison's case.

519
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:01,805
It was a big story at the time.

520
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,895
I mean, the-the press
was ferocious, no?

521
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:07,942
Y-You say "f-ferocious"?

522
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,727
- Yes, ma'am, we say that.
- Yeah?

523
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:13,382
<i>Putain.</i>

524
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:14,993
Dumbass.

525
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,777
Yeah, people...
they don't know how to drive

526
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,083
in this fucking town.

527
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:20,346
It's a crazy place, Marseille.

528
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,130
But I still prefer it to Paris.

529
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:25,394
You know, people actually
talk to each other here.

530
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,483
And plus, it's cheaper.

531
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:31,096
And why did Allison
come here for school?

532
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,575
I'm curious.

533
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,969
- Don't know.
- No?

534
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,015
Yeah, she was going
to Oklahoma State.

535
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,973
She just called me up
one day, said,

536
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,019
"I'm going to France," to here.

537
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,760
She's independent.

538
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:46,502
Yes, ma'am. Always been.

539
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:47,721
Are you close?

540
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,637
Well, you read her letter.

541
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,857
And where is her mother?

542
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,685
She passed.

543
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,035
Killed herself.

544
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,605
Allison was raised
by her grandmother mostly.

545
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:04,042
I wasn't around much.

546
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,521
Where were you?

547
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:08,785
Working oil rigs and...

548
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:10,831
being a fuckup when I wasn't.

549
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,791
It's not easy
being a single parent.

550
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:17,446
I often work at night, and
Maya, she gets really upset.

551
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,709
- What do you do?
- I'm an actress.

552
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:21,798
- Oh, on TV?
- No.

553
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,887
Theater.

554
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,541
Do you go to theater?

555
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,717
No, ma'am.

556
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,893
- Never?
- No, ma'am.

557
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,419
Okay.

558
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,774
<i>Uh, thank y'all
for talking to me.</i>

559
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,126
So, this guy that she met
at the party, Akim...

560
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:48,651
uh, anything she could
tell us about him?

561
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:58,139
She said he was quiet and nice.

562
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,619
Nice?

563
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,582
And then he told her friend
he'd stabbed a girl

564
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:08,932
and that the police
never caught him.

565
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,760
- So...
- Okay.

566
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,458
Does she know where he lives?

567
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,161
Does she know where he lives?

568
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,645
- <i>À Kalliste.</i>
- <i>Kalliste?</i>

569
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,821
She says he lives
in a different project.

570
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,605
It's called Kalliste.

571
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,141
- What's she saying?
- Nothing helpful.

572
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,623
I-I'm, uh... <i>le père.</i>

573
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:50,060
Uh, Allison.

574
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:51,975
That's my little girl.

575
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:54,021
Allison is my... <i>ma fille.</i>

576
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:56,110
You understand?

577
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:05,902
She doesn't want to help.

578
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:07,904
Can she tell me anything?

579
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,602
Wh-What does this guy
look like?

580
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,872
- Where they going?
- They're leaving.

581
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:20,787
Uh, no, no, no. Hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

582
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,181
Wait, no, no. Hold on.
Just wait. No, no.

583
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,312
- All right, all right.
- <i>Wouah, wouah, wouah! Wouah!</i>

584
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:26,923
Souad. Hey, Souad! Souad!

585
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,795
Bill, Bill, let them go, okay?
She's afraid.

586
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:30,231
Afraid of what?
I'm talking to her.

587
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,928
Yeah, but that's not
how it works here.

588
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:33,539
Well, you tell me
how it works then,

589
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:34,888
'cause nobody here's
doing shit for me.

590
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,977
I do shit for you, okay?

591
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,154
We should go. Now.

592
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,200
Okay?

593
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,854
- Yeah, all right.
- All right?

594
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,083
That's it. Kalliste.

595
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,085
That's where she says
Akim lives.

596
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,913
Well, can we go look around?

597
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:01,610
No. Not at this time.

598
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:04,222
It's not safe for us.

599
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,832
'Cause we're white?

600
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,010
'Cause we're not from there.

601
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:12,230
And there's a lot of dealing.

602
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,057
Well, I got to do something.

603
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,234
No one will talk to you,
trust me.

604
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:20,890
Bill, what if there's no Akim?

605
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,892
There is.

606
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:24,981
Okay, but they never
found this person

607
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:26,766
during the investigation.

608
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,289
My daughter's not a liar.

609
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,899
No, I didn't say she was.

610
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:31,336
It's just that everything
I read about the case...

611
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:33,599
So you're some kind
of expert now?

612
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,037
No, I'm not.

613
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:43,609
The press was against us.

614
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,699
All they cared about was

615
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:49,136
Allison was sleeping
with some Arab girl.

616
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,921
Bunch of...

617
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:53,662
fake news scumbags.

618
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:57,187
That's why you punched
that English reporter?

619
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:02,062
I was drinking then.

620
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:14,117
<i>Hey, did you
tell Gram about Leparq?</i>

621
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,989
No.

622
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:19,297
No, I didn't want to get her
hopes up until we know more.

623
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,299
She's getting on,
your grandmother.

624
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,303
Oh, I had a meeting
with the judge yesterday.

625
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,306
Oh, yeah? About what?

626
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,829
Well, I have my parole review

627
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,874
coming up
in about three months.

628
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,050
And, uh, it's the thing
where I get out of here

629
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,051
one day a month.

630
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,444
Yeah, okay.

631
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,099
- So what'd he say?
- She. She said.

632
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:42,972
Uh, you know, as long as
my behavior remained good,

633
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,452
shouldn't be a problem.

634
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:47,760
I felt like saying,
"Fuck parole.

635
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,805
My lawyer's working on getting
me out of here for good."

636
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:51,416
No, we don't know that yet,
Ally.

637
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,809
- You got to keep...
- I know, I know, I know, Dad.

638
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:56,986
I-I didn't say that.
But I wanted to.

639
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,033
And... somebody from
Leparq's office was there.

640
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,470
Oh, yeah?

641
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:05,212
Yeah. I never met her,
but I asked her

642
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:07,301
how the investigation was going.

643
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,825
What'd she tell you?

644
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,697
She said she didn't know
anything about it,

645
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,047
but she also said
she just started working there.

646
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,876
Leparq's probably
taking care of it herself.

647
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,356
It's a big case.

648
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,835
Yeah.

649
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,837
I told her I wanted
to talk to Leparq.

650
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,361
She should be
keeping us informed.

651
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,319
- You know what I mean?
- I'll talk to her.

652
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:30,933
Okay. Well...

653
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,718
I'll see you in a couple days.

654
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:34,763
Uh, Dad, do you think that
you could stay in Marseille

655
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,199
a little longer?

656
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,940
Just in case
something comes up.

657
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:40,160
Yeah, I could do that.

658
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:43,206
I'll check in on work
and stuff.

659
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,819
I-I can have Gram wire you
some money if you need.

660
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:48,777
No, no, don't do that.
I-I'll figure it out.

661
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,257
Thanks, Dad.

662
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,912
Bye.

663
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:08,231
Uh, Max.

664
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,842
<i>Salut.</i>

665
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,906
- <i>D'accord.</i>
- Ay.

666
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:18,954
Now, once the oil company
has a lease...

667
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:20,347
Give it here, M.

668
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,479
Come on.

669
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:25,308
Once that oil company
has that lease,

670
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,180
they hire a drilling company.

671
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:28,964
That's who I work for.

672
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:31,010
And then we get there,
we rig up

673
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:32,402
and we put
all that shit together.

674
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:35,449
Once we have that rig up,

675
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,190
we start making hole.

676
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,974
That's what a roughneck does.

677
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,106
We make hole.

678
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:42,500
All right, test it.

679
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:45,328
Go on, flush it.

680
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:47,026
Get it.

681
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:48,244
- Flush.
- Ah, flush.

682
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,420
- Yeah.
- <i>D'accord.</i>

683
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:52,248
Flush.

684
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,555
- <i>Ça va?</i>
- Hell yeah, <i>ça va!</i>

685
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,344
Bill, come.

686
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:02,520
Come here.

687
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:04,913
Come and see this.

688
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:06,567
Nedjma is a technical genius.

689
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,569
I'm not a genius.
I'm just younger.

690
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:13,443
- Okay...
- These are online or some shit?

691
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:15,358
These are all from
Instagram accounts

692
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,491
of Souad and her bitchy friend.

693
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,102
And these photos
are all from the party.

694
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,408
How'd y'all get them?

695
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:23,541
I set up
a false Instagram account,

696
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:26,500
followed Souad and her lovely
friend whose name is Samira,

697
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,067
and then geotagged the party

698
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,895
Souad was at
when she saw this guy.

699
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:33,246
So there's a chance
Akim is in one of these photos.

700
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:40,253
...Arab and light skin.

701
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,037
Yeah, uh, light skin,
yeah, and tall.

702
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:50,132
So we're going
to print them up,

703
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:52,047
and then you can show them
to Allison.

704
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:55,355
- No, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why?

705
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:57,400
If Akim is there, she'll know.

706
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:59,141
I don't care.

707
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:01,274
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna do it to her.

708
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:02,928
I got to protect her.

709
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,407
I don't understand.

710
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:07,410
Wh-why you're being
so stubborn about Allison?

711
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:09,325
What we should do
is go back to Souad

712
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:10,936
now we got those pictures.

713
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:13,634
Well, we stole these photos
from Instagram,

714
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:15,505
so I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

715
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,335
- Well...
- Can I say something?

716
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:20,989
<i>Ouais, vas-y.</i>

717
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:23,426
Did anyone else in Marseille
see this Akim guy

718
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,254
or just Allison?

719
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,039
Bar owner.

720
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:28,257
Where they met.

721
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:29,737
He was at the trial.

722
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:31,565
- He didn't do shit, but...
- Okay.

723
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,089
Uh, what's it called, the bar?
What's the name?

724
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,961
I don't remember
the name of it.

725
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:38,616
- It was near her apartment.
- Yeah. Okay.

726
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:39,704
- Mm.
- Mm.

727
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,332
Okay.

728
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,508
Bill, did you vote for Trump?

729
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,989
No.

730
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:06,469
<i>Ah. Voilà.</i>

731
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,733
- I didn't vote.
- What?

732
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:11,605
- Why didn't you vote?
- Got a record.

733
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,129
I was arrested.

734
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,218
They don't let you vote
when that happens.

735
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:36,586
It's there, around that corner.

736
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:42,244
Your friend, uh, Nedjma...

737
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:44,682
she mad at you for helping me?

738
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,772
Don't worry about Nedjma;
she's generally hostile.

739
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:50,209
You know, she's very protective
with me,

740
00:44:50,252 --> 00:44:51,689
but she's a good friend.

741
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:54,169
She helps me with Maya.

742
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,781
Where's Maya's father?

743
00:44:56,824 --> 00:45:00,088
Corsica, running
a nightclub on the beach.

744
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,612
He was a... a fling.

745
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:04,527
- That's how you say?
- Fling, yeah.

746
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:06,225
Yeah.

747
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:07,748
Does he visit?

748
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:10,055
He used to, but it's better
when he doesn't.

749
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:14,189
What?

750
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,192
That's where Allison lived.

751
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:20,805
Twenty-one.

752
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:24,765
That's where it happened?

753
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,375
Yeah.

754
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,602
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- <i>Bonjour.</i>

755
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:49,790
He's the new owner.

756
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:52,401
He wasn't there
when the crime happened.

757
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:54,447
Does he know where we could
find the old owner?

758
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,579
Yes, I know.

759
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:57,755
He's right there.

760
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,800
Drinking my profits.

761
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:16,382
<i>Euhm...</i>

762
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,303
He recognize anybody?

763
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:41,799
What's he saying?

764
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,296
<i>Putain.</i>

765
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,646
Okay. <i>Ç'est bon.</i> Let's go.

766
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,778
What'd he say?

767
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,345
Nothing. He's useless.

768
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:10,915
Hey.

769
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:16,311
Hey!

770
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:18,574
Hey! What happened?

771
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,881
I'm sorry. I just, uh... I can't
talk to that guy anymore.

772
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,275
He was just saying
some horrible things.

773
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:24,885
Like what?

774
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,931
Like he just wants to put
an Arab kid in jail, you know?

775
00:47:26,974 --> 00:47:28,758
He doesn't care which one.

776
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:30,804
That's it?

777
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:33,502
That's it?
What do you mean, "That's it"?

778
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:34,677
He's a racist.

779
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,375
Okay, he's a racist.

780
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:37,680
We still got to talk to him.

781
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:39,682
No. I don't talk to him, no.

782
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:41,554
Well, he might know something.

783
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:43,208
No, he doesn't know something!

784
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,471
Bill, we're not gonna send
an innocent boy to jail.

785
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:47,386
My daughter is innocent.

786
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:50,215
<i>Quoi? Oh, putain.</i> Can't believe
this conversation.

787
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:53,348
Well, then y-you live
in some fancy-ass world, honey,

788
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:55,394
'cause I work with guys
like that all the time.

789
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:57,352
No, but it doesn't matter, okay?
It's not right.

790
00:47:57,396 --> 00:47:58,788
I'm not saying it's ri...

791
00:47:58,832 --> 00:47:59,877
I'm trying to get
my little girl out of jail.

792
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,356
That's all I give a fuck about.

793
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,011
And you sound
very American right now.

794
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:06,231
Good. I am.

795
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:07,623
Yeah, and you're also
a stranger here.

796
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,234
You don't understand shit.
You know what?

797
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:36,609
Mr. Baker, one moment please.

798
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:38,002
You have a message.

799
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:41,005
She said you need more money

800
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:43,050
because Leparq
reopened the case?

801
00:48:43,094 --> 00:48:44,834
I'm dealing with it, Sharon.

802
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:46,836
- Dealing with what?
- Nothing.

803
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,491
I mean, Allison told me
to give her a letter.

804
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:52,016
I did, and now Leparq's
looking into it.

805
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:54,583
Well, i-is she looking
for Akim again?

806
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:57,282
I'm-I'm... I told you
I'm dealing with it, Sharon.

807
00:48:57,325 --> 00:49:00,024
- Who is gonna pay for this?
- Nobody's talking about money.

808
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,373
Okay?

809
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:03,375
Bill, have you been drinking?

810
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:04,724
No.

811
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,030
Listen, Sharon, I'm her father.

812
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:07,857
Oh, my God, Bill.

813
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:09,772
You're supposed to visit
and come home.

814
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:11,339
Don't mess with this.

815
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:12,950
Y-You're gonna need
to trust me on this.

816
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,516
That's it.

817
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,909
I'm gonna call Leparq.

818
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,563
No, don't do that, Sharon.

819
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:18,781
Sharon!

820
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:33,753
Dad, what is going on?

821
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:35,624
I talked to Gram, she said that
you're acting really weird.

822
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:37,452
All right, I just need you
to trust me, all right?

823
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:40,020
I need you to look
at these pictures.

824
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:41,674
Dad?

825
00:49:41,717 --> 00:49:43,632
Dad...

826
00:49:43,676 --> 00:49:44,894
are you drinking?

827
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:47,593
What? No, never.

828
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:49,029
Are you using?

829
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:51,466
Ally, I'm done with that shit.
You know that.

830
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,859
Now, come on,
look at these pictures.

831
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:54,817
Wh-What the fuck are these?!
Where's Leparq?!

832
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:56,471
- Wh-Why isn't she here?!
- Just look at the photos

833
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:58,604
and tell me if you see Akim!

834
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,999
I think he's in there.

835
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:05,045
Please, baby.

836
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:07,482
Please.

837
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,790
Please.

838
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,671
- No, I don't see him.
- Okay, all right. There's more.

839
00:50:22,715 --> 00:50:24,543
There's more.

840
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:37,991
Holy shit.

841
00:50:39,732 --> 00:50:40,863
Holy shit.

842
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:42,039
You see him? Which one?

843
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:44,084
That's him.

844
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:45,781
That's him. That's Akim.

845
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:48,523
You're sure?
That's the guy from that night?

846
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:51,439
Daddy, that's him.

847
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:57,576
<i>Kalliste?</i>

848
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,928
Yeah. Uh, <i>oui.</i> In there.

Thank you.

00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,216
Excuse me, ma'am.

Ma'am, you seen that guy before?

Akim?

854
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:34,134
- <i>Non. Non.</i>
- He lives, he lives here. No?

855
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:37,877
Ma'am, have you

856
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:43,143
Excuse me, sir.

00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:45,537
- You seen that guy before?
- <i>Non.</i>

858
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,582
How about you?
Have you seen this guy before?

859
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:48,801
<i>Nan.</i>

860
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:56,156
- Looking for him. Akim.
- No.

861
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,158
You know him? Akim?

862
00:51:58,202 --> 00:51:59,768

Y'all know this guy?

<i>Non...</i>

Akim?

869
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:32,975
<i>Non, non. Non, non, non.</i>

870
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,281
This guy?

871
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:35,282
No?

872
00:52:52,691 --> 00:52:54,649
Hey. You know that guy?

873
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:56,608
Right there? Akim?

874
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:58,175
You know him?

875
00:52:58,218 --> 00:52:59,915
This guy, Akim, he lives here?

876
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:01,656
Yeah.

877
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,180
<i>Non, non.</i>

878
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:04,746
How about... Akim?

<i>Non, non.</i>

880
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:08,750
Bye-bye, cowboy.

881
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:42,044
You speak English?

882
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,745
Hey, you know this guy?
This... His name's Akim.

883
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:48,355
He li... he lives here.

884
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:49,878
Akim?

885
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,315
The guy lives here.

886
00:53:58,104 --> 00:54:00,585
I-I speak English.
You suck my dick.

887
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:19,881
<i>Allez!</i>

888
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:34,200
- <i>Ici.</i>
- <i>Merci.</i>

889
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:39,161
Hi.

890
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:43,862
They asked me
if I knew anybody.

891
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:46,343
Are you okay?

892
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:49,694
I saw him.

893
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:51,260
I saw Akim.

894
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:53,437
In Kalliste.

895
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,221
Did you tell the police?

896
00:56:02,097 --> 00:56:04,056
That was my chance.

897
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:08,321
<i>That was my chance.</i>

898
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,315
What the fuck did you do?

899
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:48,317
I was trying to help.

900
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:50,494
Tell me exactly
what you did, Dad.

901
00:56:52,104 --> 00:56:53,322
Dad.

902
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:56,456
She wouldn't do it, Ally.

903
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,850
Leparq wouldn't
look into the case.

904
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:03,332
Oh, my God.

905
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,379
You fucking lied.

906
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:09,295
About all of it.

907
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,123
Of course you did.

908
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:13,908
I found him, Ally.

909
00:57:13,952 --> 00:57:15,344
I found Akim.

910
00:57:15,388 --> 00:57:18,913
And why didn't you
call the police?

911
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:20,219
Why?!

912
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,787
Why?!

913
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:25,485
You let him get away!

914
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,356
He's fucking gone now!

915
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,446
He's fucking gone!

916
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,798
I feel so stupid.
I feel so stupid.

917
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:38,193
You've always lied to me,
my entire life, always!

918
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:41,240
I hate myself
for ever trusting you!

919
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,466
- Ally, listen to me.
- No!

920
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:51,511
No! No.

921
00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:56,821
You are done
fucking up my life.

922
00:57:57,604 --> 00:57:59,476
Do you get that?

923
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:03,305
Do you?

924
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:05,917
Stay the fuck away from me.

925
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:27,242

Well, appreciate the honesty.

Hated everything about it.

started making hole.

- <i>Oui,</i> I make hole.
- No shit.

That's the lowest of the low.
A worm.

977
01:01:36,867 --> 01:01:38,695
<i>Non, pas un</i> worm.

978
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,609
<i>Je veux travailler</i>
<i>sur le derrick,</i> like you.

979
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:42,133
You going right to the derrick?

980
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:44,309
You got to have the want-to.

981
01:01:44,352 --> 01:01:45,832
You got the want-to?

982
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:48,139
<i>Ben, oui.</i>

983
01:01:48,182 --> 01:01:49,575
Hey.

984
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:54,841
Thank you, Lord, for this and other blessings.

985
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:56,234
Please look after Ally.

986
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:57,278
Keep a close eye on her.

987
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:59,411
We ask this in Jesus' name.

988
01:01:59,454 --> 01:02:00,586
Amen.

989
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:02,109
- Dig in.
- Dig in.

990
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:03,720
- <i>Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir, maman.</i>

991
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:05,286
- Hey.
- Hey.

992
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:14,513
- There's a burger up there if you want it.
- Thanks. Ah.

993
01:02:14,556 --> 01:02:15,688
For me?

994
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,081
Yes, ma'am.

995
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:18,430
- That's rent.
- Thank you.

996
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:23,609
Would you please
get me the ketchup?

997
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:29,223
<i>Non.</i>

998
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,705
- <i>Mais oui.</i>
- Thank you.

999
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,881
Bill, she has to do
her homework.

1000
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:38,145
I know. Hundred percent.

1001
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:39,407
Do your homework.

1002
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:43,368
- Yeah?
- Mm.

1003
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:45,326
<i>Merci.</i>

1004
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:48,329
When I see what you guys eat, I
understand why you pray before.

1005
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:52,681
- How was play practice?
- Rehearsal.

1006
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:55,293
Uh, it was shit.

1007
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:58,296
We do a lot of stage writing,
so it's messy,

1008
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:02,343
and, uh, the-the director...
he's young and provincial.

1009
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:04,476
What's stage writing?

1010
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:08,306
We don't know what we're doing,
so we make it up instead.

1011
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:09,611
Cool.

1012
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:11,831
Cool Raoul.

1013
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:16,270
Drops back,
scrambles to the middle.

1014
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:19,447
Down inside the ten,
so the clock is running,

1015
01:03:19,491 --> 01:03:20,797
clock is running.

1016
01:03:22,668 --> 01:03:24,452
Back to bed.

1017
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:25,932
I look with you?

1018
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:28,369
No way.

1019
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:29,544
Bed.

1020
01:03:29,588 --> 01:03:31,633
You're gonna get me in trouble.

1021
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:32,896
My tablet.

1022
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,854
Yeah, I'm using it.

1023
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,377
Bed, now.

1024
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,558
...fourth
quarter. Well, why not?

1025
01:04:00,662 --> 01:04:02,186
Hello?

1026
01:04:03,274 --> 01:04:04,536
Yeah, this is him.

1027
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:08,192
It's a one-day leave.

1028
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:09,671
She goes out in the morning,

1029
01:04:09,715 --> 01:04:11,456
comes back to the prison
at night.

1030
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:12,849
Then if it goes well,

1031
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:14,938
she'll get another day
the following month.

1032
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:16,983
The idea is for inmates
to acclimate

1033
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:18,855
to the outside world again.

1034
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,291
Understand?

1035
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:21,596
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1036
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,209
The judge requires a chaperone,

1037
01:04:25,252 --> 01:04:27,646
someone who is
going to vouch for her.

1038
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:30,649
Did she ask for me?

1039
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:32,869
No.

1040
01:04:32,912 --> 01:04:35,872
But you are the only option.

1041
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:37,874
Okay.
A-Allison hasn't talked to me

1042
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:39,571
for more than four months.

1043
01:04:40,572 --> 01:04:41,965
I am aware.

1044
01:04:43,662 --> 01:04:45,359
Mr. Baker,

1045
01:04:45,403 --> 01:04:47,535
do not take any initiative
this time.

1046
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:49,798
Understand?

1047
01:04:49,842 --> 01:04:51,931
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1048
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:36,758
Huh?

1049
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:38,760
Color she love.

1050
01:05:38,804 --> 01:05:40,371
Oh, her favorite color?

1051
01:05:40,414 --> 01:05:41,459
<i>Ah, oui,</i> "favorite."

1052
01:05:41,502 --> 01:05:42,764
Yeah, not sure.

1053
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,989
Hey, Maya?

1054
01:05:51,077 --> 01:05:52,644
No.

1055
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,431
I thought it was pretty.

1056
01:05:57,475 --> 01:05:58,824
Bill! Bill!

1057
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:06,484
Ah, soccer, no.
Allison likes Oklahoma State.

1058
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:08,355
She likes real football.

1059
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:09,835
This is football,
favorite foot.

1060
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:11,924
No, these guys
are a bunch of babies.

1061
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,317
Bunch of crybabies.

1062
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:20,846
All right, all right, don't
get all wound up. How much?

1063
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:27,679
<i>Maman.</i>

1064
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:34,555
<i>Euh, non.</i>

1065
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:35,948
<i>Merci, Bill.</i>

1066
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,342
- All right.
- <i>Merci, Bill.</i>

1067
01:06:39,604 --> 01:06:40,953
- <i>Oui.</i>
- <i>Bonjour, Maya.</i>

1068
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,042
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1069
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,044
Hi. You must be Bill.

1070
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:46,437
Yes, sir. Hi.

1071
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,395
Good to meet you.

1072
01:06:48,439 --> 01:06:52,356
Uh, Virginie told me
you-you are from Oklahoma.

1073
01:06:52,399 --> 01:06:53,705
That's so cool.

1074
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:56,534
Okay.

1075
01:06:56,577 --> 01:06:59,145
Renaud is
a rising star director.

1076
01:06:59,189 --> 01:07:00,842
That's me.

1077
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:02,888
Oh, you're the one
who does the stage writing?

1078
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:05,499
Yeah. You know about
stage writing?

1079
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:07,023
Great.

1080
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:09,895
Y-You know, man, I really love
working like this.

1081
01:07:09,938 --> 01:07:11,027
It's real, you know?

1082
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:14,639
Stage writing? It's truth.

1083
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:16,684
It's from life.

1084
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:19,513
Virginie been telling me
about it, right?

1085
01:07:19,557 --> 01:07:21,559
Yeah. <i>Merci, Bill.</i>

1086
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:23,778
Um, would you help me
move the table?

1087
01:07:23,822 --> 01:07:25,519
- 'Cause dinner is...
- Yeah, I got it.

1088
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:27,043
<i>Merci, Bill.</i>

1089
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:29,871
Seriously, for me,
it makes total sense.

1090
01:07:29,915 --> 01:07:31,569
People should be able
to carry guns.

1091
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:34,093
You know, but they got freedom.

1092
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:35,703
It's basic freedom.

1093
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:37,575
I would love to have a gun.

1094
01:07:40,491 --> 01:07:41,970
I'm sure you have a gun.

1095
01:07:42,014 --> 01:07:44,190
- Don't you, Bill?
- Yes, sir, I do.

1096
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:47,063
- Yes!
- No, you do not.

1097
01:07:47,106 --> 01:07:49,065
Why wouldn't I?
I got two of them.

1098
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:51,110
I got a shotgun and a Glock.

1099
01:07:51,154 --> 01:07:53,504
- <i>Oh, non, putain. C'est pas vrai.</i>
- Two guns! It's perfect!

1100
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:55,810
<i>Non, non. Arrête, arrte.</i>
It's okay. It's okay.

1101
01:07:55,854 --> 01:07:57,203
It's-it's his...

1102
01:07:57,247 --> 01:07:59,510
- His-his... his culture.
- Culture.

1103
01:07:59,553 --> 01:08:01,164
Culture is
such a broad concept, huh?

1104
01:08:02,948 --> 01:08:04,645
I'm gonna call it
a night, y'all.

1105
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:06,473
Come on, Bill. It's early.

1106
01:08:06,517 --> 01:08:08,649
- I'll put Maya to bed.
- Oh, I can do it.

1107
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:10,738
- I got it.
- Okay.

1108
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,136
You're my favorite.

1109
01:08:18,964 --> 01:08:20,444
Favorite what?

1110
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:24,056
Favorite American.

1111
01:08:29,017 --> 01:08:31,063
Sweet dreams, little girl.

1112
01:08:59,831 --> 01:09:02,094
You know
it's Sunday morning, right?

1113
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,617
Where's your friend?

1114
01:09:04,662 --> 01:09:07,186
Oh, he left early this morning.

1115
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,970
Mm.

1116
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:10,972
We had a bit too much to drink.

1117
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:12,800
Ain't no shit.

1118
01:09:16,282 --> 01:09:21,200
I was thinking, uh, I'd like
to bring Allison by the house.

1119
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:24,769
Won't it be too much for her?

1120
01:09:24,812 --> 01:09:27,163
I'd like her to see
where I live.

1121
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:29,948
If you're okay with it.

1122
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:32,037
Why wouldn't I be?

1123
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:35,214
Not everybody is.

1124
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:57,149
- Hey.
- Hey.

1125
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:00,848
This your van?

1126
01:10:00,892 --> 01:10:02,850
From work.

1127
01:10:02,894 --> 01:10:04,765
What work?

1128
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:06,158
Construction.

1129
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,247
I told you about it
in my letters.

1130
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,553
You didn't get them?

1131
01:10:09,596 --> 01:10:11,294
I did.

1132
01:10:12,904 --> 01:10:14,210
I didn't read them.

1133
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:18,910
- You want to get going?
- Yeah.

1134
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:31,836
<i>Merci.</i>

1135
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:19,884
Life is brutal.

1136
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:28,980
Can I drive?

1137
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:40,121
♪ I've been sacrificed

What are they gonna do?

1155
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,691
Arrest me?

1156
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:11,795
O.M.

You really are a local now.

1158
01:14:13,971 --> 01:14:15,320
Maya sold me on it.

1159
01:14:15,363 --> 01:14:17,061
That's her favorite team.

1160
01:14:18,105 --> 01:14:19,542
Does this kid have a father?

1161
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:21,892
He's not around.

1162
01:14:21,935 --> 01:14:23,894
Lives on a beach or some shit.

1163
01:14:23,937 --> 01:14:25,809
Groovy.

1164
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,248
So is this woman
your girlfriend?

1165
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:31,858
It's not like that.

1166
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:33,947
I just live with them.

1167
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:35,471
Like roommates.

1168
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:38,430
What does she do?

1169
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:41,955
She's sort of an actress.

1170
01:14:41,999 --> 01:14:43,522
Sort of an actress?

1171
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:46,830
She a stripper?

1172
01:14:46,873 --> 01:14:48,266
No.

1173
01:14:50,311 --> 01:14:52,270
She just don't do
TV acting or anything.

1174
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:54,533
She does theater.

1175
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:57,144
Theater.

1176
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:01,235
Have you seen her act?

1177
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,848
What am I gonna do
in a fucking theater?

1178
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:08,068
Yeah.

1179
01:15:16,163 --> 01:15:18,209
You know what's messed-up?

1180
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,518
I never had a chance
to mourn her.

1181
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:24,084
Lina.

1182
01:15:27,305 --> 01:15:30,177
It was so intense
when we first met.

1183
01:15:32,136 --> 01:15:34,051
She was so funny.

1184
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:37,533
And cool and beautiful.

1185
01:15:41,972 --> 01:15:44,191
Then she moved in,
and everything got fucked-up.

1186
01:15:45,715 --> 01:15:48,500
She started sleeping
with other people.

1187
01:15:50,197 --> 01:15:52,243
Like it didn't matter.

1188
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:58,336
Like she was just using me.

1189
01:15:59,424 --> 01:16:01,121
Or something.

1190
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:08,172
And I felt so humiliated.

1191
01:16:11,044 --> 01:16:13,438
But, you know, the really
fucked-up thing is...

1192
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:17,529
...I just want to see her.

1193
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:22,490
I just want to be with her.

1194
01:16:24,971 --> 01:16:26,364
So much.

1195
01:16:31,543 --> 01:16:33,501

1200
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,344
Thanks, Dad.
I think she knew that.

1201
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:52,608
I'm Virginie.

1202
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:54,305

1206
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,707
Get out here.

Hey, y'all.

1213
01:18:21,174 --> 01:18:22,785
- Ah, watch out. It's hot. It's hot.
- Ow, that's...

1214
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:25,396
- Yeah. Well, then take this.
- I got it.

1215
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:28,225
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1216
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:36,450
Let's pray.

1217
01:18:38,278 --> 01:18:40,063
Thank you, Lord, for this
and many other blessings.

1218
01:18:40,106 --> 01:18:42,326
Thank you for this special day
with Ally.

1219
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:45,459
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

1220
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,504
Maya?

1221
01:18:46,547 --> 01:18:48,375
Dig in.

1222
01:18:51,683 --> 01:18:53,772
- There you go.
- <i>Merci.</i>

1223
01:18:54,817 --> 01:18:56,383
Thank you.

1224
01:18:58,646 --> 01:19:00,692
So you two
really aren't having sex?

1225
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:03,347
Allison Baker.

1226
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:05,088
What? What?

1227
01:19:05,131 --> 01:19:06,872
You're so French now,
I-I thought it was okay

1228
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:09,353
to talk about sex
at the dinner table.

1229
01:19:09,396 --> 01:19:10,746
Sorry.

1230
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:13,444
Is it okay?

1231
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:14,706
The food.

1232
01:19:15,707 --> 01:19:17,317
It's honestly
the best meal I've had

1233
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:19,145
in a really long time.

1234
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:20,581
Good.

1235
01:19:21,713 --> 01:19:23,410
And, no, we don't have sex.

1236
01:19:23,454 --> 01:19:24,760
Jesus.

1237
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:28,111
<i>Oui.</i>

1238
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:34,160
So where did you
have lunch today?

1239
01:19:34,204 --> 01:19:36,684
- Pizza.
- Pizza?

1240
01:19:36,728 --> 01:19:39,600
- Chez Sauveur. It's my favorite place.
- Oh.

1241
01:19:39,644 --> 01:19:41,646
- Yeah?
- It's so good.

1242
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:46,782
And, uh, I'm curious, why did
you come to Marseille to study?

1243
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:49,306
It was far away.

1244
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,831
And completely different.

1245
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:56,400
And the pizza.

1246
01:20:00,317 --> 01:20:02,362
I like it, too.

1247
01:20:17,203 --> 01:20:18,814
Uh, oh, no.

1248
01:21:30,973 --> 01:21:32,888
He's a fuckup.

1249
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:34,933
Always has been.

1250
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:23,677
It's more beautiful
on this side of the wall.

1251
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:30,858
I like them.

1252
01:22:30,902 --> 01:22:32,469
Virginie and Maya.

1253
01:22:32,512 --> 01:22:34,732
It's good what you have.

1254
01:22:34,775 --> 01:22:36,952
I'm just trying to do it right.

1255
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,998
I'm happy for you, Dad.

1256
01:22:53,055 --> 01:22:54,360
- <i>Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.</i>

1257
01:23:00,932 --> 01:23:02,499
Hey.

1258
01:23:05,589 --> 01:23:06,982
How are you doing?

1259
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:09,810
Pretty good.

1260
01:23:09,854 --> 01:23:11,638
Yeah?

1261
01:23:11,682 --> 01:23:12,988
The day was nice?

1262
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,686
Flew by.

<i>Oh. Bonne nuit.</i>

1267
01:23:34,705 --> 01:23:36,011
Good night.

1268
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:51,852
Hello?

1269
01:23:57,945 --> 01:23:59,686
Excuse me.

1270
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:02,472
I'm Bill Baker, father of
Allison Baker, from Baumettes.

1271
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:20,533
What happened to her?

1272
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,580
What does that mean?

1273
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,778
Fuck off me.

1274
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:12,063
I don't leave you,
you don't leave me.

1275
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,935
I don't leave you,
you don't leave me.

1276
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:21,942
Is she okay?

1277
01:25:21,986 --> 01:25:23,727
She's stable.

1278
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:02,069
Hey, Bill.

1279
01:26:05,856 --> 01:26:07,640
<i>I talked to Sharon again,</i>

1280

1281
01:26:11,035 --> 01:26:12,993

Ah, Bill.

1286
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:00,737
What, did I mess it up?

1287
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,304
<i>Oui,</i> you messed it up.

<i>So, what did you think?</i>

1300
01:28:18,075 --> 01:28:19,772
What'd I think?

1301
01:28:19,816 --> 01:28:22,122
Yeah. Of the play.
What did you think?

1302

Oh, it was good, yeah.

1303
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:26,649
Yeah? What was good?

1304
01:28:27,998 --> 01:28:29,391
Well...

1305
01:28:31,001 --> 01:28:33,351
I don't fucking know.
I don't know shit about plays.

1306
01:28:33,395 --> 01:28:36,963
- Plus, it's all in French.
- Oh, come on, Bill. One thing.

1307
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:39,314
Um...

1308
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:41,316
Uh, no one stands
like real people.

1309
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:43,796
- What?
- It just looks weird.

1310
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,320
Look, it's great, I'm sure.

1311
01:28:45,363 --> 01:28:46,930
I don't... D-Don't-don't ask me.

1312
01:28:46,973 --> 01:28:48,323
- I'm a dumbass.
- No, you're not.

1313
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:51,717
And, no, it's not great, no.

1314
01:28:52,849 --> 01:28:54,024
<i>Ah, merci.</i>

1315
01:28:56,418 --> 01:28:58,333
Cheers.

1316
01:28:59,377 --> 01:29:01,858
I will say, you were...

1317
01:29:01,901 --> 01:29:03,250
really good.

1318
01:29:03,294 --> 01:29:04,774
Best thing up there.

1319
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:11,171
So, I got exciting news.

1320
01:29:12,434 --> 01:29:14,000
I got the part.

1321
01:29:14,044 --> 01:29:15,959
- On the TV show?
- Mm-hmm.

1322
01:29:16,002 --> 01:29:17,874
- Yeah, and I said I'd do it.
- No shit.

1323
01:29:17,917 --> 01:29:19,441
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1324
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:21,921
But...

1325
01:29:21,965 --> 01:29:24,315
it's more money,
but it's also more hours,

1326
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:27,013
so that means I'll have to pay
for a babysitter

1327
01:29:27,057 --> 01:29:28,841
and I'll be away more
from Maya.

1328
01:29:28,885 --> 01:29:31,191
Well, I could help
with Maya, too.

1329
01:29:31,235 --> 01:29:32,410
No, you help enough, you know?

1330
01:29:32,454 --> 01:29:33,933
You got a job. You're busy.

1331
01:29:33,977 --> 01:29:36,762
I don't care. I want to.

1332
01:29:40,287 --> 01:29:41,767
Why?

1333
01:29:42,768 --> 01:29:43,987
- Why?
- Mm.

1334
01:29:45,336 --> 01:29:47,904
I like spending time with her.

1335
01:29:48,905 --> 01:29:50,385
And with me, too?

1336
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:53,953
Yeah.

1337
01:29:53,997 --> 01:29:55,259
And you, too.

1338
01:29:56,826 --> 01:29:59,002
How much do you enjoy it?

1339
01:30:01,221 --> 01:30:02,962
A lot.

1340
01:30:03,006 --> 01:30:06,096
I would say a lot.

1341
01:30:08,272 --> 01:30:10,927
This would be
a serious change for us.

1342
01:30:11,928 --> 01:30:13,930
Guess it would.

1343
01:30:13,973 --> 01:30:16,498
You guess?

1344
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:19,239
Well, I mean, I know.

1345
01:30:19,283 --> 01:30:20,240
Oh.

1346
01:30:20,284 --> 01:30:23,809
And you know... what?

1347
01:30:23,853 --> 01:30:25,942
Ah, for fuck's sake.

1348
01:30:35,299 --> 01:30:37,257
Do you have cash?

1349
01:30:37,301 --> 01:30:39,869
Yeah. Yeah.

1350
01:30:39,912 --> 01:30:41,523
Uh, how much is it?

1351
01:30:45,831 --> 01:30:47,920
Sixty.

1352
01:30:47,964 --> 01:30:49,922
No shit?

1353
01:30:59,976 --> 01:31:02,282
- Hey.
- Hey.

1354
01:31:02,326 --> 01:31:03,806
This is your music.

1355
01:31:03,849 --> 01:31:05,460
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1356
01:31:05,503 --> 01:31:07,331
I-It's a bit sad, no?
Maybe I...

1357
01:31:07,374 --> 01:31:09,246
- Ah, hell no.
- Huh?

1358
01:31:09,289 --> 01:31:11,944
- No, it's beautiful.
- Yeah?

1359
01:31:11,988 --> 01:31:13,946
Yeah, you can dance to it.

1360
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:15,470
Really?

1361
01:31:16,514 --> 01:31:18,516
No, no, no. Come here.

1362
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,213
Come here.

1363
01:31:20,257 --> 01:31:21,867
I'll show you.

1364
01:31:21,911 --> 01:31:24,304

Oh.

01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:26,008
Wow.

1396
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:52,687
Damn, the place is heating up.

- <i>Quoi?</i>
- A lot of fans.

1398
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:56,560
Going nuts.

1399
01:34:58,867 --> 01:35:00,738
Someone should tell them
they're winning.

1400
01:35:51,267 --> 01:35:53,748
All right, let's go.

1401
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:27,782
<i>Pardon, pardon, pardon.</i>

1402
01:36:53,372 --> 01:36:54,591
Bill.

1403
01:36:56,723 --> 01:36:59,204
Oh, I think I see
a friend from work.

1404
01:36:59,248 --> 01:37:00,510
Want to see if it's him.

1405
01:37:36,241 --> 01:37:37,852
Okay, let's go get the van.

1406
01:37:37,895 --> 01:37:40,419
- Is it your friend?
- No, that wasn't him.

1407
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,510
- Hey.
- Hey.

1408
01:37:44,554 --> 01:37:46,599
- How's it going?
- Uh, good. Game just ended.

1409
01:37:46,643 --> 01:37:48,210

- Okay, take your time.
- <i>Ç'est maman?</i>

1411
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,691
- It's your night.
- Okay.

1412
01:37:51,735 --> 01:37:53,780
Uh, see you in a bit.

1413
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,291
<i>Wouah!</i>

1414
01:39:25,437 --> 01:39:26,786
Go back to sleep.

1415
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:28,963
Go on.

1416
01:39:29,006 --> 01:39:30,660
We're going home.

1417
01:39:48,591 --> 01:39:49,722
<i>Ça va.</i>

1418
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:54,031
Mr. Baker.

1419
01:39:54,075 --> 01:39:55,902
Nice to see you again.

1420
01:39:55,946 --> 01:39:56,991
You're late.

1421
01:39:57,034 --> 01:39:58,949
Oh.

1422
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,342
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1423
01:40:02,866 --> 01:40:04,694
What can I do for you,
Mr. Baker?

1424
01:40:06,522 --> 01:40:08,828
That DNA test we talked about...
I want to get it done.

1425
01:40:08,872 --> 01:40:12,354
First I will need, uh,
the DNA sample.

1426
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:27,891
Can I ask you how you got this?

1427
01:40:27,934 --> 01:40:29,893
Can you do it or not?

1428
01:40:29,936 --> 01:40:32,722
Yes, I can.

1429
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:37,596
But I am an ex-cop,
so let me tell you,

1430
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:39,859
it will be a serious mistake
to commit a crime

1431
01:40:39,903 --> 01:40:42,601
to prove your daughter innocent.

1432
01:40:42,645 --> 01:40:44,864
It will not get her out of jail.

1433
01:40:44,908 --> 01:40:46,475
And it will send you in.

1434
01:40:46,518 --> 01:40:48,868
- Do you understand?
- How fast can you do it?

1435
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:52,655
It's hard to say.

1436
01:40:52,698 --> 01:40:56,093
A week at least,
but it will cost you.

1437
01:40:56,137 --> 01:40:57,877
Here's 3,000 now.

1438
01:40:57,921 --> 01:40:59,705
I'll give you another 3,000
when you get it done,

1439
01:40:59,749 --> 01:41:01,403
but it's got to be quicker
than a week.

1440
01:41:01,446 --> 01:41:04,058
Even if it matches,
I still have to find this guy.

1441
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:05,755
No, you don't.

1442
01:41:05,798 --> 01:41:07,539
You know where he is?

1443
01:41:10,977 --> 01:41:13,980
He could still disappear
before the results come back.

1444
01:41:14,024 --> 01:41:16,809
He won't.
Call me when you get it done.

1445
01:41:31,215 --> 01:41:32,912
Come on.

1446
01:41:37,874 --> 01:41:39,441
Maya?

1447
01:41:42,618 --> 01:41:44,010
Maya?

1448
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:50,582
Hey, Maya?

1449
01:41:54,151 --> 01:41:56,066
Hey.

1450
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,633
Hey.

1451
01:41:57,676 --> 01:41:59,069
- This is quite a greeting.
- You seen Maya?

1452
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,505
- I was in the shower.
- Yeah.

1453
01:42:00,549 --> 01:42:02,116
She's playing soccer
in the courtyard.

1454
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,944
I'm sorry I'm late.

1455
01:42:04,988 --> 01:42:07,121
- Oh, that's all right.
- It...

1456
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:09,514
Don't you want to ask me
about my first day at work?

1457
01:42:09,558 --> 01:42:11,125
Uh, yeah, yeah. How'd it go?

1458
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:31,188
- Bill?
- Hmm?

1459
01:42:31,232 --> 01:42:33,495
Who is the man in the cave?

1460
01:42:36,628 --> 01:42:37,847
In the cave?

1461
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:40,719
With the tools.

1462
01:42:40,763 --> 01:42:42,808
I saw him.

1463
01:42:48,684 --> 01:42:51,730
Um, I'm gonna need your help.

1464
01:42:51,774 --> 01:42:53,819
Okay?

1465
01:42:53,863 --> 01:42:56,822
'Cause it's a secret.

1466
01:42:56,866 --> 01:42:59,564
You can't tell anyone.

1467
01:42:59,608 --> 01:43:01,000
Even your mom.

1468
01:43:01,044 --> 01:43:02,611
Okay?

1469
01:43:04,265 --> 01:43:06,180
He's a bad man.

1470
01:43:06,223 --> 01:43:08,747
He'll be gone soon.

1471
01:43:09,879 --> 01:43:11,837
It's gonna be our secret.

1472
01:43:11,881 --> 01:43:13,578
Okay?

1473
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:19,541
That's my girl.

1474
01:45:20,836 --> 01:45:22,185
Shit.

1475
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:55,349
<i>I learned
something new actually.</i>

1476
01:45:56,393 --> 01:45:58,830
It's helped me a lot.

1477
01:45:58,874 --> 01:46:01,442
It's something called
the "Mektub."

1478
01:46:01,485 --> 01:46:04,488
A nurse told me about it.

1479
01:46:04,532 --> 01:46:06,011
It's about acceptance.

1480
01:46:06,055 --> 01:46:08,362
Acceptance of what?

1481
01:46:09,406 --> 01:46:10,973
Your fate.

1482
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:15,107
It's helping me
to stop struggling so much.

1483
01:46:15,151 --> 01:46:17,414
Stop questioning everything.

1484
01:46:19,111 --> 01:46:22,376
You just embrace your fate

1485
01:46:22,419 --> 01:46:24,378
and learn to live in peace
with it.

1486
01:46:26,075 --> 01:46:28,425
It's a Muslim idea.

1487
01:46:28,469 --> 01:46:30,471
It's about...

1488
01:46:30,514 --> 01:46:33,430
letting go of all of that...

1489
01:46:35,911 --> 01:46:37,260
...shame...

1490
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:42,221
...and guilt
that pushes you down

1491
01:46:42,265 --> 01:46:44,398
and keeps you down

1492
01:46:44,441 --> 01:46:48,184
and makes you feel
so powerless.

1493
01:46:49,141 --> 01:46:51,970
And that's how I felt
for a really long time.

1494
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:57,106
Powerless and forgotten.

1495
01:46:59,325 --> 01:47:01,240
And...

1496
01:47:01,284 --> 01:47:04,243
that makes living really hard.

1497
01:47:05,244 --> 01:47:07,290
You know what I mean?

1498
01:47:10,511 --> 01:47:13,122
But you're innocent.

1499
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,865
So we got to keep fighting.

1500
01:47:16,908 --> 01:47:19,955
It doesn't matter
that I'm innocent, Dad.

1501
01:47:21,217 --> 01:47:23,262
It's not about justice.

1502
01:47:25,613 --> 01:47:28,050
It's about finding peace.

1503
01:48:06,088 --> 01:48:07,872
I don't know
what you're saying,

1504
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:09,918
but you're wasting your breath.

1505
01:48:09,961 --> 01:48:14,531
We're gonna wait for that DNA,
and then we'll know.

1506
01:48:14,575 --> 01:48:17,926
She ask me. She pay me.

1507
01:48:17,969 --> 01:48:19,362
You want more water?

1508
01:48:19,405 --> 01:48:22,496
Allison, she say,
"Go. You put Lina out."

1509
01:48:22,539 --> 01:48:23,497
- That's enough, now.
- "Money for you."

1510
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:25,368
That's enough, now.

1511
01:48:25,411 --> 01:48:27,588
She tell me take it.

1512
01:48:27,631 --> 01:48:29,154
She gave me <i>collier.</i>

1513
01:48:29,198 --> 01:48:30,286
"You take it.

1514
01:48:30,329 --> 01:48:31,983
- Money after."
- Here.

1515
01:48:32,027 --> 01:48:33,507
Drink that.

1516
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:34,899
Go on.

1517
01:48:36,031 --> 01:48:38,250
<i>Un collier.</i>
"You take it for you."

1518
01:48:38,294 --> 01:48:40,426
<i>Collier.</i> Gold.

1519
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:43,212
Like this. Like this.

1520
01:48:43,255 --> 01:48:45,519
The necklace?
I-I don't want that.

1521
01:48:45,562 --> 01:48:47,477
No!

1522
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:48,870
She gave me.

1523
01:48:48,913 --> 01:48:51,350
She say,
"Go. You put Lina out.

1524
01:48:51,394 --> 01:48:54,310
Necklace now. Money after."

1525
01:48:54,353 --> 01:48:56,007
You're not even making sense.

1526
01:48:56,051 --> 01:48:57,574
Time to shut the fuck up.

1527
01:48:57,618 --> 01:48:59,489
S-Stillwater!

1528
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:04,973
What'd you say?

1529
01:49:05,016 --> 01:49:07,105
The <i>collier.</i>

1530
01:49:07,149 --> 01:49:09,020
He say "Stillwater."

1531
01:49:10,021 --> 01:49:11,893
Gold.

1532
01:49:11,936 --> 01:49:13,938
She say...

1533
01:49:14,939 --> 01:49:18,290
"Do it. Make her go.

1534
01:49:18,334 --> 01:49:20,292
Make her go out."

1535
01:49:39,616 --> 01:49:40,617
Hey.

1536
01:49:40,661 --> 01:49:42,140
- Hey.
- Where were you?

1537
01:49:42,184 --> 01:49:44,534
I walked back from
the, uh, Baumettes.

1538
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:46,536
We have to go and see Isabelle.

1539
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,016
We'll be late
if we don't leave now.

1540
01:49:48,059 --> 01:49:51,367
Do, uh... do I have to go?

1541
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:53,064
Yes, of course.

1542
01:49:53,108 --> 01:49:54,718
I told her you were coming.

1543
01:49:54,762 --> 01:49:57,242
Hurry up, please. Maya...

1544
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,638
<i>Oui, maman.</i>

1545
01:50:01,682 --> 01:50:03,727
<i>So, Isabelle is</i>

1546
01:50:03,771 --> 01:50:06,991
<i>a sort of like godmother
for us.</i>

1547
01:50:07,035 --> 01:50:08,689
<i>Maya really loves her.</i>

1548
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:11,256
Well, you'll see.

1549
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:13,432
This is really
the other side of Marseille.

1550
01:50:18,699 --> 01:50:20,222
<i>Marraine!</i>

1551
01:50:20,265 --> 01:50:21,615
<i>Ah.</i>

1552
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:51,645
I don't
know what you're talking about.

1553
01:50:51,688 --> 01:50:54,386
The gold necklace
I gave her the day she left.

1554
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:56,214
Said "Stillwater" on it.

1555
01:50:56,258 --> 01:50:58,129
Yeah, I remember it.
What about it?

1556
01:50:58,173 --> 01:51:00,305
D-Do you remember, was
she wearing it at the trial?

1557
01:51:00,349 --> 01:51:02,351
Did she still have it on?

1558
01:51:02,394 --> 01:51:04,135
What are you getting into,
Bill?

1559
01:51:04,179 --> 01:51:07,182
Wh-When we went to get
her stuff, did you see it?

1560
01:51:07,225 --> 01:51:08,444
Oh, I don't know.

1561
01:51:08,487 --> 01:51:10,359
I don't remember. Why?

1562
01:51:10,402 --> 01:51:12,317
I'll talk to you later, Sharon.
Bye.

1563
01:51:14,406 --> 01:51:16,321
<i>Ça va?</i>

1564
01:51:16,365 --> 01:51:18,280
Yeah. Yeah, <i>ça va.</i>

1565
01:51:19,324 --> 01:51:20,674
Uh, talking to Sharon.

1566
01:51:20,717 --> 01:51:23,328
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

1567
01:51:23,372 --> 01:51:24,503
Are you?

1568
01:51:24,547 --> 01:51:26,505
What do you mean?

1569
01:51:26,549 --> 01:51:29,291
You just seem <i>distrait.</i>

1570
01:51:30,292 --> 01:51:32,555
I am. Sorry.

1571
01:51:34,122 --> 01:51:35,514
I'm happy you're here.

1572
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,343
Me, too.

1573
01:51:38,387 --> 01:51:40,650
You, too?

1574
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:42,652
Y-You're-you're happy
you're here?

1575
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:44,698
- Yeah?
- I am.

1576
01:51:45,742 --> 01:51:47,222
Really.

1577
01:51:48,745 --> 01:51:50,312
Me, too.

1578
01:51:51,792 --> 01:51:53,750
I like you, Bill Baker.

1579
01:52:03,194 --> 01:52:04,413
Okay, come.

1580
01:52:15,816 --> 01:52:17,556
<i>Mr. Dirosa,</i>

1581
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:18,862
it's Bill Baker.

1582
01:52:18,906 --> 01:52:21,343
Uh, really need that result.

1583
01:52:21,386 --> 01:52:23,824
Uh, it's kind of urgent.

1584
01:53:03,254 --> 01:53:05,126
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

1585
01:53:05,169 --> 01:53:06,301
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1586
01:53:49,997 --> 01:53:51,172
<i>Bonne journée.</i>

1587
01:53:51,215 --> 01:53:52,608
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1588
01:54:15,587 --> 01:54:17,546
You know, I used to fight
a lot at school

1589
01:54:17,589 --> 01:54:19,809
when I was a kid, too.

1590
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:22,856
But that's not good. Fight? No.

1591
01:54:26,381 --> 01:54:28,426
You sure you don't want this?

1592
01:54:29,906 --> 01:54:33,214
The man in the cave,
you will kill?

1593
01:54:33,257 --> 01:54:35,216
What? No.

1594
01:54:35,259 --> 01:54:36,826
Of course not.

1595
01:54:42,832 --> 01:54:45,879
I would never, ever do anything
to hurt you or your mother.

1596
01:54:45,922 --> 01:54:46,880
Never.

1597
01:54:50,405 --> 01:54:52,276
Because I love both of you.

1598
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,887
So much.

1599
01:54:54,931 --> 01:54:56,498
I do.

1600
01:54:59,544 --> 01:55:01,677
You just have to trust me.

1601
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:02,896
Okay?

1602
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,248
Okay.

1603
01:55:29,879 --> 01:55:32,534
Mr. Baker, a word please.

1604
01:55:32,577 --> 01:55:34,318
Police.

1605
01:55:34,362 --> 01:55:37,278
Can I see your I.D. please?

1606
01:55:37,321 --> 01:55:39,367
Your I.D., Mr. Baker.

1607
01:55:44,589 --> 01:55:45,982
Thank you.

1608
01:55:46,026 --> 01:55:47,941
Take off your cap.

1609
01:55:52,336 --> 01:55:54,556
Okay. Thank you.

1610
01:55:56,079 --> 01:55:57,776
So, Mr. Baker, my colleagues

1611
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:59,604
are gonna take
the little girl inside.

1612
01:55:59,648 --> 01:56:01,302
Okay?

1613
01:56:01,345 --> 01:56:02,781
- No, Bill.
- Okay, all right, all right, all right.

1614
01:56:02,825 --> 01:56:04,522
It's okay. It's all right.

1615
01:56:04,566 --> 01:56:05,741
- You go with her.
- No.

1616
01:56:05,784 --> 01:56:07,438
<i>Tout va bien. Tout va bien.</i>

1617
01:56:07,482 --> 01:56:08,526
It's all right.

1618
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:12,791
You're all right.

1619
01:56:12,835 --> 01:56:14,837
So, Mr. Baker, look at me.

1620
01:56:16,491 --> 01:56:18,841
Do you have a basement here?

1621
01:56:20,843 --> 01:56:22,410
Yes or no?

1622
01:56:23,889 --> 01:56:25,021
Yes, sir.

1623
01:56:25,065 --> 01:56:27,632
Okay. Give me the keys please.

1624
01:56:49,959 --> 01:56:51,004
Please.

1625
01:57:06,541 --> 01:57:08,412
Stop.

1626
01:57:27,605 --> 01:57:29,085
Stop.

1627
01:57:45,667 --> 01:57:46,929
Do you have the key?

1628
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:50,063
Mr. Baker.

1629
01:57:50,106 --> 01:57:51,760
He's got it.

1630
01:58:16,045 --> 01:58:18,743
Let's go upstairs.

1631
01:58:24,749 --> 01:58:26,534
Sit.

1632
01:58:58,914 --> 01:59:00,089
<i>Viens.</i>

1633
01:59:03,527 --> 01:59:04,833
<i>Vas-y, chérie.</i>

1634
01:59:19,848 --> 01:59:20,849
<i>Oui.</i>

1635
01:59:24,287 --> 01:59:25,984
- <i>Oui.</i>
- <i>Ah.</i>

1636
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,517
<i>Oui.</i>

1637
01:59:45,047 --> 01:59:46,222
<i>Ah.</i>

1638
02:00:16,861 --> 02:00:18,036
- <i>Non?</i>
- <i>Non.</i>

1639
02:00:19,647 --> 02:00:21,214
- <i>Oui.</i>
- <i>Mm.</i>

1640
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:13,918
Okay.

1641
02:01:40,336 --> 02:01:41,685
Virginie, I didn't mean to...

1642
02:01:41,729 --> 02:01:43,383
How did you find him?

1643
02:01:45,254 --> 02:01:47,169
Pure chance.

1644
02:01:47,212 --> 02:01:48,866
The soccer game.

1645
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:52,000
With Maya?

1646
02:01:59,399 --> 02:02:01,314
Did you ask her to lie?

1647
02:02:02,967 --> 02:02:04,665
Did you?

1648
02:02:05,796 --> 02:02:08,321
I never meant
to involve you or Maya.

1649
02:02:12,325 --> 02:02:14,022
- I know...
- You...

1650
02:02:16,024 --> 02:02:17,721
You have to leave now.

1651
02:02:21,246 --> 02:02:24,424
Okay. You pack your things,
you leave.

1652
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:39,352
May I come in?

1653
02:02:45,227 --> 02:02:46,794
Maya?

1654
02:02:52,234 --> 02:02:54,236
You don't want to talk to me?

1655
02:02:55,542 --> 02:02:57,326
All right.

1656
02:03:00,068 --> 02:03:01,765
I'm sorry.

1657
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:07,945
I'm so sorry.

1658
02:03:14,256 --> 02:03:15,431
I love you.

1659
02:03:48,159 --> 02:03:49,509
Bill.

1660
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:51,772
<i>Non.</i>

1661
02:04:45,478 --> 02:04:46,957
<i>Mr. Baker,</i>

1662
02:04:47,001 --> 02:04:49,960
I've come with some
extraordinary news.

1663
02:04:50,004 --> 02:04:52,354
The judge in your daughter's
case called me this morning.

1664
02:04:52,397 --> 02:04:54,095
New evidence has surfaced.

1665
02:04:54,138 --> 02:04:56,097
Apparently, a retired cop

1666
02:04:56,140 --> 02:04:59,317
came up with a DNA match
on the unknown sample.

1667
02:04:59,361 --> 02:05:02,320
It also matched
a sample the police collected

1668
02:05:02,364 --> 02:05:04,192
on a burglary case
four years ago,

1669
02:05:04,235 --> 02:05:06,194
after the trial.

1670
02:05:06,237 --> 02:05:07,543
Did they catch him?

1671
02:05:07,587 --> 02:05:10,024
No, not yet.

1672
02:05:10,067 --> 02:05:13,462
But all we need to prove
is sufficient doubt.

1673
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:16,160
So even if they can't
find the suspect,

1674
02:05:16,204 --> 02:05:18,336
there's a real chance
they will release Allison.

1675
02:05:19,337 --> 02:05:21,557
In fact, the judge
has already agreed

1676
02:05:21,601 --> 02:05:26,214
to reopen the investigation,
which is almost unheard of.

1677
02:05:27,258 --> 02:05:29,565
I think this could only happen
in Marseille.

1678
02:05:36,703 --> 02:05:39,227
Thank you for coming
to tell me, ma'am.

1679
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:43,013
Mr. Baker, this is
the best possible outcome

1680
02:05:43,057 --> 02:05:44,537
for your family.

1681
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:46,060
Do you understand?

1682
02:05:46,103 --> 02:05:48,018
I do.

1683
02:05:49,063 --> 02:05:50,543
Thank you, ma'am.

1684
02:06:16,090 --> 02:06:17,613
Go, Pokes!

1685
02:06:22,618 --> 02:06:24,707
I told you we were gonna
bring our girl home,

1686
02:06:24,751 --> 02:06:27,188
and that's exactly what we did.

1687
02:06:31,584 --> 02:06:33,455
Welcome home, Allison.

1688
02:06:34,717 --> 02:06:36,371
Welcome back to Oklahoma.

1689
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:39,417
<i>Welcome back to America!</i>

1690
02:07:29,424 --> 02:07:31,165
You're being antisocial?

1691
02:07:36,605 --> 02:07:38,215
You all right?

1692
02:07:44,744 --> 02:07:48,486
The day you left for Marseille,

1693
02:07:48,530 --> 02:07:51,489
Sharon and I drove you
to the airport, and...

1694
02:07:51,533 --> 02:07:54,318
when we got there,

1695
02:07:54,362 --> 02:07:57,626
I was embarrassed I didn't have
a present or nothing,

1696
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:00,629
so I went to the gift shop.

1697
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:05,286
I thought I'd get you a book
or a key chain or something.

1698
02:08:06,374 --> 02:08:08,419
Then I saw this necklace.

1699
02:08:10,334 --> 02:08:14,208
I thought it'd be like a little
piece of home to take with you.

1700
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:17,646
It was gold.

1701
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:19,561
Said "Stillwater" on it.

1702
02:08:33,662 --> 02:08:36,578
I didn't want it to happen.

1703
02:08:40,277 --> 02:08:42,540
He told me that
he would just help me

1704
02:08:42,584 --> 02:08:44,760
get her out of the apartment,
that's all.

1705
02:08:46,588 --> 02:08:49,156
I didn't want her to die.

1706
02:08:50,766 --> 02:08:52,725
I loved her.

1707
02:08:54,248 --> 02:08:56,380
I know you did.

1708
02:08:58,252 --> 02:09:00,254
You think I'm a monster?

1709
02:09:01,646 --> 02:09:02,778
You're my daughter.

1710
02:09:02,822 --> 02:09:05,781
I... I could never think that.

1711
02:09:08,697 --> 02:09:11,178
Dad, what is wrong with us?

1712
02:09:14,442 --> 02:09:17,140
I don't know, baby girl.

1713
02:09:17,184 --> 02:09:19,142
I don't know.

1714
02:09:19,186 --> 02:09:21,492
I'm sorry.

1715
02:09:21,536 --> 02:09:23,103
I'm so sorry.

1716
02:09:24,539 --> 02:09:27,150
I'm sorry.

1717
02:09:31,328 --> 02:09:32,852
Me, too.

1718
02:10:17,897 --> 02:10:21,204
♪ Take the ribbon
from my hair ♪

1719
02:10:23,772 --> 02:10:28,342
♪ Shake it loose
and let it fall ♪

02:10:30,344 --> 02:10:33,869

1721
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:39,875

1722
02:10:46,926 --> 02:10:48,753
Morning.

1723
02:10:48,797 --> 02:10:50,364
Hey.

1724
02:10:53,019 --> 02:10:55,586
Couldn't sleep.

1725
02:10:56,761 --> 02:10:59,416
Went for a walk, and...

1726
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:01,592
ended up here.

1727
02:11:04,291 --> 02:11:05,858
I'm glad you did.

1728
02:11:11,602 --> 02:11:13,343
You miss them?

1729
02:11:17,434 --> 02:11:18,958
I do.

1730
02:11:20,568 --> 02:11:21,917
Can you go back?

1731
02:11:23,963 --> 02:11:25,747
No, I can't.

1732
02:11:28,576 --> 02:11:30,491
But it was good.

1733
02:11:30,534 --> 02:11:32,406
That don't change.

1734
02:11:37,324 --> 02:11:38,891
I'm sorry.

1735
02:11:41,850 --> 02:11:43,765
Life is brutal.

1736
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:03,437
Everything looks the same here.

1737
02:12:05,787 --> 02:12:07,658
Nothing's changed.

1738
02:12:09,747 --> 02:12:11,314
Don't you think?

1739
02:12:15,318 --> 02:12:17,364
No, Ally, I don't.

1740
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:21,890
It all looks different to me.

1741
02:12:23,805 --> 02:12:26,329
I don't hardly
recognize it anymore.
