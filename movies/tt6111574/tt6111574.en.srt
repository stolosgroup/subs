00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,351
- <i>What are you eating?</i>
<i>- Guess.</i>

3
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,097
- <i>I can't guess.</i>
<i>- Bet you can.</i>

4
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,325
- <i>How can I guess?</i>
<i>- What day is it today?</i>

5
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,809
<i>Uh, it's Monday.</i>

6
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,853
<i>Oh. Sunday night's pizza night.</i>

7
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,747
<i>You're eating leftover pizza.</i>

8
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,233
<i>Hey, make Dad go pick you out a pumpkin.
It's that time of year again.</i>

9
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,734
<i>They're all over.</i>

10
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,194
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

11
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,840
<i>- Let me talk to Daddy, sweetheart.</i>
<i>- Delivery.</i>

12
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,240
<i>Daddy!</i>

13
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,117
<i>Daddy!</i>

14
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,421
- <i>Hey, Slugger.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

15
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,733
<i>- Tell me something good.</i>
<i>- Something good.</i>

16
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,637
- <i> You were right about 101.</i>
<i>- How's that?</i>

17
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,557
<i>The Russells are very white.</i>

18
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,143
<i>There goes the neighborhood.</i>

19
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,854
<i>But who moves in</i>
<i>after a one-day paint job?</i>

20
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,148
<i>Well, you said it was in good shape.</i>

21
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,194
<i>I wish you were here.</i>

22
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,864
- <i>Who does that help, saying that?</i>
<i>- I can beat myself up if I want.</i>

23
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,742
<i>Go for it.</i>
<i>It's just an audience of one.</i>

24
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>I'm not playing.</i>

25
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,621
<i>Tell me to go outside.</i>

26
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,124
<i>Why not make today</i>
<i>the day you go outside?</i>

27
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,877
So, what's the latest on the street?

28
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,088
What happened with the barking dog?

29
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,508
I thought we were going
to talk about medications.

30
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,843
We'll get there.

31
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,387
Would you like to take a seat?

32
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,848
Did it get squared away?

33
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,932
The dog?

34
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,101
Um…

35
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,104
I guess they started bringing him inside.

36
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,940
Did you end up calling 311?

37
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,150
Oh, David talked me out of it.

38
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,820
It's more of a bother for him anyway.
It's louder downstairs.

39
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,907
So, I… must have talked to somebody.

40
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,325
Peaceful resolution.

41
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,869
This is the second session
that you've done this.

42
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,454
Ask about the neighborhood?

43
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,832
Does that make you uncomfortable?

44
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,293
I just don't know what you're goin' for.

45
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,587
How's the prayer group?

46
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,799
They're getting by.

47
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,343
Do you think they know you're watching?

48
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,512
Is this really what you wanna talk about?

49
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,057
What about 101?

50
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,143
Looks like they already moved in.

51
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,645
What'd they pay?

52
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,939
Five-five. They were asking for six.

53
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,148
Who are they?

54
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,275
The Russells.

55
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,736
Alistair and Jane.
The broker says they're from Boston.

56
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,988
Where's the money from?

57
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,948
She says he's a banker.

58
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,117
But there's practically
nothing about them online.

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,493
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

60
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,203
What the fuck, Karl?

61
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,291
Curiosity is evidence
of a decreased depression pattern.

62
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,712
People who snoop on their neighbors
don't kill themselves?

63
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,256
Let's try this.

64
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,342
People who attempt suicide
lose the right to joke about it.

65
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,889
I have a review with Dr. Kenner this week.

66
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,310
Seeing as I've been unable to get you
out the front door for the last 10 months,

67
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,437
she's gonna wonder about
the source of my optimism.

68
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,189
Let's talk about the Elevan.

69
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,525
Now that you've curtailed the drinking,

70
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,569
how are you feeling
about the side effects?

71
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,032
<i>I think you're reading into it.</i>

72
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,744
<i>I've been a shrink for 15 years.</i>
<i>I know a threat when I hear one.</i>

73
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,162
<i>He's on your side, Slugger.</i>

74
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,997
<i>He's the reason you're still here.</i>

75
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,666
<i>It's not really therapy</i>
<i>if there's a knife at your back.</i>

76
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,003
<i>He comes every week, rain or shine.</i>
<i>He's been there all the way through.</i>

77
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,589
<i>No, he's getting off on controlling me.</i>

78
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,008
- <i>Really?</i>
<i>- Yes. Did you read about Elevan?</i>

79
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,384
<i>Take a look at the side effects.</i>

80
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,428
<i>I know you're not supposed to drink on it.</i>

81
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,430
<i>They always say that.</i>

82
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,849
Shit.

83
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,778
Yes?

84
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,572
<i>I live, um, across the street there.</i>

85
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,990
And?

86
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,494
<i>My mom asked me to give you this.</i>

87
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,413
I'm sorry…

88
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,332
I'm not prepared for visitors.

89
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,084
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

90
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,962
<i>Do you have any ideas about
what I should do with this?</i>

91
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,589
You can just…

92
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,468
Push the door.

93
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,807
Hi. I'm Ethan.

94
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,890
Yes.

95
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,601
Hi. Anna.

96
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm from… across the street.

97
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Yes.

98
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,443
Sorry, I know you're not having,
uh, visitors.

99
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,153
No, I'm… fine.

100
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,029
You just surprised me, that's all.

101
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,323
I'm not really a visitor so much.

102
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,034
I'm kind of, uh, more like a neighbor.

103
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,207
- I love lavender.
- Heh.

104
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,586
My mom asked me
to give it to you, like… days ago.

105
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,881
I think that I'm the one
supposed to be giving you a gift, eh…

106
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,382
Welcome to the neighborhood.

107
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,925
Mm.

108
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,725
I like cats' tongues.

109
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,479
Sorry they're not fish fingers, buddy.

110
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,730
He likes you.

111
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,689
No.

112
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,693
How do you like your new house?

113
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,278
I miss the old one.

114
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,031
But we had to leave Boston.

115
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,284
Are those your… people?

116
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,827
Family? Yes.

117
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,953
Are they home?

118
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,501
No, they don't live here. We're separated.

119
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,128
How old is she?

120
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,547
She's eight.

121
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,968
How old are you?

122
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,638
I'm gonna be 16 in six months.

123
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,722
Five months.

124
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,938
What do you do?

125
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,319
Oh, I'm a psychologist. I work with kids.

126
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,402
Really?

127
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,947
Really.

128
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,407
- That's interesting.
- Why is that interesting?

129
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:57,370
I mean, it's more interesting
than, like, working at Taco Bell.

130
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,497
Why would kids need a psychologist?

131
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,850
You really don't know why
a kid would need a psychologist?

132
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,460
No, I mean, I'm sure they do,
but I mean, like, why?

133
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,463
Like, why do the kids who see you
need a psychologist?

134
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,675
- All sorts of reasons.
- School shootings or torturing someone?

135
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,720
No, it doesn't have to be that dramatic.
Some of them are depressed,

136
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,305
some suffer from anxiety…

137
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,142
Some of them are… just having
a hard time adjusting to a new place.

138
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,362
I can see your house from my room.

139
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,866
I mean…

140
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,701
Normally.

141
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,956
Right now, I can see…

142
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,001
My dad from your house.

143
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,383
Are you okay?

144
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,635
Yeah.

145
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,680
Are you sure?

146
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,641
No, nothing, I just…

147
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,727
Hey.

148
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,566
You can talk to me.

149
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,736
I don't know anyone here.

150
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
You know me.

151
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,656
Not really.

152
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,284
Well, you could.

153
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,952
Really?

154
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,954
We-we can be friends?

155
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,082
Sure.

156
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,171
Wow. You have a lot of movies.

157
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,424
Too many. That's what my husband says.

158
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,052
I thought you said
you guys were separated.

159
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,638
He's still my husband, but you're right.

160
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,682
You're welcome to borrow anything.

161
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,144
Uh… My dad's kind of a tyrant with the TV.

162
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,479
Oh.

163
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,486
Goodbye, Punch.

164
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,696
I'm sorry I'm so allergic to you.

165
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,491
Why didn't you say something?

166
00:10:59,075 --> 00:10:59,992
Oh.

167
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,661
I don't wanna offend him.

168
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,954
He's not that sensitive.

169
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,538
Okay.

170
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,007
Okay, then.

171
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,759
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

172
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,014
See you around?

173
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,182
Yeah, see you around.

174
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:31,440
<i>…in some incredibly rustic community
where good manners are unknown…</i>

175
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,360
…or you suffer
from the common feminine delusion

176
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,195
that the mere fact of being a woman

177
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,948
exempts you from the rules
of civilized conduct.

178
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,241
Conduct.

179
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,044
Possibly both.

180
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,704
<i>Possibly.</i>
<i>But here's what I wanted to show you…</i>

181
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,390
I'm headed to Brooklyn.

182
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,277
- You need me to take care of anything?
- Right. Uh, no. Thanks, I'm good.

183
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,028
Sure? Take out the garbage?

184
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,407
- Okay. As long as you're here.
- Okay.

185
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,995
You know, David, you've been
my tenant for three months.

186
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,371
You don't have to be so formal.

187
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,665
You can just come in through
the basement stairs.

188
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,418
No, I don't wanna startle ya.

189
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,503
It's dark in here.
Do the bulbs need changing?

190
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,298
- I like it dim.
- Okay.

191
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,301
Oh, Halloween tonight.

192
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,762
How do we do it without you going outside?

193
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,722
You want me to get some candy?

194
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,307
I'm not going to give out candy.

195
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,671
I'm going to turn the lights out
and pretend I'm not home.

196
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,733
We could just get a bowl of candy
and leave it on the porch, like…

197
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,154
Any kid would take it within a minute
and then they'd take the bowl.

198
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,449
Why don't we get a bowl of apples?
'Cause kids won't take apples.

199
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,576
Then what's the point?

200
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,040
Yeah. Okay.

201
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,126
Have a nice time.

202
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,337
Sure. Happy Halloween.

203
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,133
<i>Let your mind</i>
<i>go back to your childhood.</i>

204
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,468
<i>Was it happy?</i>

205
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,471
<i>Whom did you know in your childhood?</i>

206
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,682
<i>I'm haunted but I…</i>

207
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,268
<i>I can't see by what.</i>

208
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,895
<i>It's no use.</i>

209
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,396
<i>You lived somewhere.</i>

210
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,731
<i>You had a mother.</i>

211
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,483
<i>You were loved, you had friends.</i>

212
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,566
<i>Yes.</i>

213
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,811
Get away from my house!

214
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,876
- Right there!
- Hey!

215
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,735
Get her!

216
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,422
- This is my house.
- Get her!

217
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,948
Hey.

218
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,494
You're gonna have to convince me
I don't need to call an ambulance.

219
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,121
No, don't do that.

220
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,790
Okay, you know who you are?
You know what day it is?

221
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,502
Yeah, I'm Anna. It's Halloween.

222
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,754
Okay, how many fingers?

223
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,588
Three.

224
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,051
Okay. You're all right.
You're gonna be all right. Just…

225
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,761
Breathing would be good.

226
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,639
I was headed across the street

227
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,599
when those little shits
started chucking eggs,

228
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,142
and, oof, you went down hard.

229
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,310
You're Jane Russell.

230
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,313
What makes you say that?

231
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,608
Your… your son came by.

232
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:43,984
Ethan.

233
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,195
Sit up in case you got a concussion.

234
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,365
Jesus, it's dark in here.

235
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,033
Do you faint a lot?

236
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,577
I didn't faint.

237
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,788
I mean, it's… like fainting.

238
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,666
I can't go outside.

239
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,418
Um… you didn't go outside.

240
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,421
- No, I get panic attacks.
- Who doesn't?

241
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,590
Here. Have some of this brandy, please.

242
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,717
Uh, I'm agoraphobic.

243
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,721
I can't go outside.

244
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,392
Oh! Oh.

245
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,144
- You're stuck inside this shitty house.
- Oh.

246
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,481
Oh, man. I'd hate to be stuck
inside a house this shitty.

247
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,068
Is that your husband coming home?

248
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,696
It's my tenant.

249
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,990
He lives in the basement.

250
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,619
So, um, what do you do all day?

251
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,037
I mean, do you work?

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,794
Oh, God, I'm so fucking nosy.

253
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,506
I… I should just go. Um...

254
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,466
- Do you want me to go?
- No.

255
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,218
Um…

256
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,553
No, it's…

257
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,346
It's all right. I'm fine.

258
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,598
I… counsel people.

259
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,058
You counsel people?

260
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,020
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, you're a shrink.

261
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,522
Oh! That's a twist.

262
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,191
You married?

263
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,361
- Separated.
- Ah.

264
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,196
And kids?

265
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,034
My daughter Olivia is with her father.

266
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,869
Oh, that's tough.

267
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,328
Yeah.

268
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,290
Yeah. Separated from your kid,
that's really tough.

269
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,959
I talk to them every day.

270
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,420
Yeah, it's just… It's...

271
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,965
It's not the same as them
being here, though, is it?

272
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,553
Take another drink, please.

273
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,521
- Do you wanna go outside?
- You know, I have a shrink of my own.

274
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,775
Okay. Okay. I get it. I get it.

275
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,569
All right, sorry. That sounds very wise.

276
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,653
Yeah.

277
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,948
I get it.

278
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,408
Yeah.

279
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,826
Yeah.

280
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,498
We've been trying to get me
to go outside using an umbrella.

281
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,665
Uh-huh.

282
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,960
I haven't… been able to do it yet.

283
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,378
Oh.

284
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,879
You will.

285
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,507
You will.

286
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,716
You'll figure it out.

287
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,010
Notice I'm not asking

288
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,179
- what made you this way.
- What way?

289
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,388
Agoraphobic.

290
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,391
I have anxiety. I have…

291
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,811
An anxiety disorder.

292
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,230
- Punch. Punch.
- So, um…

293
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,273
Good boy.

294
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,109
That's what all these pills are for?

295
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,235
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

296
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,779
So, what does… what does this one do?

297
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,072
This, uh, pink one.

298
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,573
Uh, that's Inderal.

299
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,617
Ah. Beta blocker.

300
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,785
How do you know that?

301
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,121
Um, 'cause it says so on the bottle.

302
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,793
Pretty sure you're not supposed to be…
taking these with alcohol.

303
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,378
Mm.

304
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,092
Thank you for the candle.

305
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,428
Ethan brought it by. Thanks.

306
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,722
Oh. Wow, okay, subject change.

307
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,141
Uh-uh.

308
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,725
I think I hurt my neck.

309
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,978
He's a nice boy.

310
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,025
- Look.
- Oh, what a cutie.

311
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,152
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

312
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,155
He's my guy. My little baby guy.

313
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:21,160
You know, when you have a kid,
you say, "He's my kid, my guy,"

314
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,495
Like he's yours, like he belongs to you.

315
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,248
- That's not really how it feels.
- You belong to them.

316
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,332
Right.

317
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,418
Right.

318
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,003
You belong to them.

319
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,088
And maybe you never belonged
to anybody before.

320
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,383
I mean, maybe, maybe you thought
you belonged to your parents.

321
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,094
You grew out of that. You certainly
didn't belong to your husband.

322
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,597
Then this kid comes along,
and he's just got you.

323
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,851
I don't have to tell you that.

324
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,071
I like your earrings.

325
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,949
Oh. Oh, thanks, yeah. A gift.

326
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,619
They're a gift from an old boyfriend.

327
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,953
Does your husband mind?

328
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,455
I doubt he knows.

329
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,501
He has trust issues.

330
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,628
Oh, why is that?

331
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,671
- Oh, I don't know.
- You don't know? Mmm.

332
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,300
No. Come on, no, no.
I don't know. I don't know.

333
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,177
- No, it's…
- Hmm.

334
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,223
Who knows
why he has them? Um…

335
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,184
He's a good guy, he's a good father.

336
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,310
He's just, you know…

337
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,938
- He's tight.
- Mm.

338
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,397
Controlling, and like…

339
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,152
I have my own issues,
but I work through them and…

340
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,528
I can handle them.

341
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,073
Maybe sometimes I have to…

342
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,617
Get in between them and I...

343
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,536
I worry about Ethan, 'cause…

344
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,747
He's sensitive.

345
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,008
Family's…

346
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,803
Complicated.

347
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,142
Why is your family complicated?

348
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,025
{\an8}- Look.
- Oh, wow! That's amazing!

349
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,486
Yeah. Jane Russell original.

350
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,282
- See how I changed the subject on you?
- I did.

351
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,534
Yeah, you don't know
who you're fooling with.

352
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,539
Hello?

353
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,708
<i>Uh, it's Alistair Russell.</i>

354
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,961
<i>We-we-we we moved in
just across the street. 101.</i>

355
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,881
Push the door.

356
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,350
I… I'm sorry to bother you.

357
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,894
I just wanted to know…

358
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:38,774
Well, I'm just curious if any of my family
has come around to see you this evening.

359
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,109
No.

360
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,198
Oh.

361
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,117
No, I... I've been alone.

362
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,539
Okay, thanks.

363
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,125
Sorry to bother you.

364
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,087
Thank your wife.

365
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,256
For the candle. Ethan brought it over.

366
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,174
Days ago.

367
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,137
Good.

368
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,975
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

369
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,227
I think there's somebody
in my house.

370
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,396
<i>What's your address, ma'am?</i>

371
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:03,483
It's 104, West 121st Street.

372
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,862
- I'm sorry.
- Whoa!

373
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,840
- It's David.
<i>- Ma'am, are you okay?</i>

374
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,949
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

375
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,701
<i>- Ma'am?</i>
- Yeah, I know him.

376
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,661
It's a false alarm. I'm sorry.

377
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,746
I... I buzzed.
I did buzz half an hour ago.

378
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,210
And I cleaned the eggs
off your front porch.

379
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,796
What are you looking for?

380
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,924
A guy across the street
asked me to help him open some boxes,

381
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,176
store some stuff.

382
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,720
I thought you might have a box cutter.

383
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,432
I didn't know you were a handyman.
I thought you were a singer-songwriter.

384
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,892
Which is why I am a handyman.

385
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,485
You know you've got mold?

386
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,861
Yeah, I do.

387
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,744
David, come back inside!

388
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,539
David?

389
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,001
Boo!

390
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,878
Shit!

391
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,176
You're gonna need a pro
to seal that roof. It's dangerous.

392
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,385
I'll call somebody.

393
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,137
You okay?

394
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,221
Yes.

395
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,016
Who were you working with
across the street?

396
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,850
Russell.

397
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,685
You know him?

398
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,439
How did he find you?

399
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,899
I put up some flyers.

400
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,965
Alistair Russell.
West 121st Street.

401
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,128
- <i>Is this a residence?</i>
- Uh, yes.

402
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,928
<i>Press one to have this number
texted to you.</i>

403
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:55,845
Oh, Jesus.

404
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,524
- <i>Uh, hello?</i>
- Ethan.

405
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,810
It's Anna, across the street.

406
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,271
<i>Hi.</i>

407
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,065
Is something going on over there?
I heard a scream.

408
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,401
<i>No, no. It's fine.</i>

409
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,529
I heard somebody scream. Was it you?

410
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,197
<i>No. </i>

411
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,324
<i>It's fine. </i>

412
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,118
Are you okay?

413
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,622
<i>He just…</i>

414
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,165
<i>It's fine.</i>

415
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,969
Ethan, do you need...

416
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,640
Hello?

417
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,268
<i>Yes, you called my number?</i>

418
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,231
Hi, this is Anna Fox
from across the street.

419
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,315
<i>Yes?</i>

420
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,235
I… heard somebody scream just now.

421
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,279
I wanted to call to check on…

422
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,572
<i>Sorry, you heard what?</i>

423
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,908
A scream. A scream.

424
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,910
Uh, a minute ago.

425
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,411
<i>A scream?</i>

426
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,790
Yeah, from your house.

427
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,126
<i>Sorry, the only people here
are me and my boy.</i>

428
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,295
<i>- And we didn't scream.</i>
- I heard…

429
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,361
<i>This is David,</i>
<i>I'm not here right now.</i>

430
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,072
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll d</i> o <i>my best to get back to you.</i>

431
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,201
David?

432
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:44,995
What's up?

433
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,414
Did you hear that scream

434
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,540
- across the street?
- No.

435
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,958
Now. Five minutes ago.

436
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,293
I was listening to music.

437
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,045
You didn't hear anybody scream?

438
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,464
I didn't hear anyone scream.

439
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,423
I'm sorry.

440
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,259
Come in here.

441
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,274
Can I get you something? Something to eat?

442
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,681
No, I'm fine.

443
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,391
Are you?

444
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,439
Ethan, what's going on over there?

445
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,150
He's not a bad guy.

446
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,236
He has a lot of stress.
It builds up in him and has to get it out.

447
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,839
- It's all right.
- It's not all right.

448
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,023
Stop saying it's all right.
It's clearly not all right.

449
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,201
I've gotta go home.
I should not have come over.

450
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,578
I'm sorry. I just…

451
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,954
No, wait.

452
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,882
- Uh…
- Shh.

453
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,382
I'm sorry.

454
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,968
It's okay.

455
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,930
Why are you so nice to me?

456
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,725
Because children need protection.

457
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,312
Sorry. The cat.

458
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,068
I want you to take my number.

459
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,946
Is your mom okay?

460
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,324
Yeah, I… I guess so.

461
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,494
I mean, she has to take his side.

462
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,620
Okay. Um…

463
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,580
All right, look.

464
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,292
Ethan?

465
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,465
Look, Ethan, um,
whatever is going on over there…

466
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,258
No matter how bad it gets…

467
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,635
This is a safe place.

468
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,930
You can always come here.

469
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,891
Always.

470
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,974
Yeah.

471
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,116
<i>You never know</i>
<i>what the right thing is to do.</i>

472
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,160
{\an8}<i>You want to call
Children's Protective Services,</i>

473
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,954
{\an8}<i>it's my word against the father's.</i>

474
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,306
- <i>Want advice?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

475
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,207
<i>Don't go look</i>
<i>into other people's houses.</i>

476
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,125
<i>Karl says curiosity is healthy.</i>

477
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,378
<i>You said he was getting off</i>
<i>on controlling you.</i>

478
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,964
<i>You said we could talk</i>
<i>whenever I wanted to.</i>

479
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,052
<i>Everything okay, Anna?</i>

480
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,135
<i>What's up?</i>

481
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,888
<i>You left a message.</i>

482
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,599
No, I don't think so.

483
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,811
<i>If I knew how to work my phone
I could play it back for you.</i>

484
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,814
<i>What are you doing?</i>

485
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,651
I'm watching David leave the house.

486
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,945
<i>Looks like fun, right?</i>

487
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,239
Looks like he's escaping.

488
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,324
<i>I'm gonna give you another number, Anna.</i>

489
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,370
<i>I don't like the idea of missing your call
while we're adjusting these new meds.</i>

490
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,394
Bitch.

491
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,151
<i>Is that why</i>
<i>you visit murder trials?</i>

492
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,234
<i>No.</i>

493
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,780
<i>I went because your case
was like my father's.</i>

494
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,325
<i>I know he didn't kill my stepmother.</i>

495
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,659
<i>I know he told the truth.</i>

496
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,583
You've been bad.

497
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,677
It's 9:50. And…

498
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,264
Thanks.

499
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,246
Don't go looking
into other people's houses, Punch.

500
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,598
<i>I'm gonna give you some shots
that'll freeze your face.</i>

501
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,601
<i>Now, just close your eyes.</i>

502
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,671
<i>It'll be all right, Vincent.</i>

503
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,863
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

504
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,657
<i>Hold your breath, cross your fingers.</i>

505
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,200
Where's my phone?

506
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,043
Where's my phone? Backtrack.

507
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,670
Backtrack, backtrack.
Keep doing it, keep doing it.

508
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,717
Where are you?

509
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,328
Give him hell, Jane.

510
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:17,115
<i>Just close your eyes.</i>
<i>I've got a fine anesthetic…</i>

511
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,955
Where's my phone?

512
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,084
David?

513
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,546
David?

514
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,941
<i>911 operator,</i>
<i>what's your emergency?</i>

515
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,443
- My neighbor, Jane, she's been stabbed.
- <i>Slow down, ma'am.</i>

516
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,070
<i>What's your name and where are you?</i>

517
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,072
I'm Anna Fox.

518
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,156
I'm Anna.

519
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,159
<i>And where are you?</i>

520
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:06,330
Um, 104, West 121st Street.

521
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,582
<i>That's 121?</i>

522
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,001
121. Yes. Yes.

523
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,836
<i>You say your neighbor was stabbed?</i>

524
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,506
He just turned out the lights.

525
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,592
<i>Where is your neighbor?</i>

526
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,219
She is across the street. And…

527
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,762
<i>- Do you have an address?</i>
- Yes.

528
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,224
104, West 124th Street.

529
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,393
<i>Wait, you said "124th Street"?</i>

530
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,146
121st Street.

531
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,399
<i>Help is on the way, ma'am.
I need you to calm down.</i>

532
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,401
- Okay.
- <i>Are you with your neighbor now?</i>

533
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,487
She is across the street. I told you that
and you are not listening to me!

534
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,781
<i>Anna! Ma'am.</i>

535
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,701
<i>Anna, did you stab your neighbor?</i>

536
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,081
Help me!

537
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,792
Help me!

538
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,461
Jane.

539
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,544
I'm coming, Jane.

540
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,757
I'm coming, Jane. I'm coming, Jane.

541
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,628
I'm coming, Jane. I'm coming, Jane.

542
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,128
I'm coming, Jane.

543
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,190
Hello.

544
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,366
Detective Little. NYPD. I was hoping
I could ask you some questions.

545
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,034
What are you doing in my house?

546
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,245
I understand you have
a tenant downstairs. He home?

547
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,371
I… I don't know.

548
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,956
- That your daughter?
- Is she here?

549
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,458
She's with her father.
What happened to Jane?

550
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,252
Hi.

551
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,254
Whoa. Uh…

552
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,339
- What is this?
- Ma'am, you all right?

553
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,842
No, why is he here?

554
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,177
Mr. Russell believes
that you made a mistake…

555
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,762
You have never met my wife.

556
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,433
She helped me one night.
We spent the evening together.

557
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,310
No, no. No, I don't think so.

558
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,438
In fact, he came here looking for her.

559
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,316
I was looking for my son, not my wife.

560
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,067
You told me no one had been here.

561
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,151
I lied.

562
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,778
We played gin.

563
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,614
- Why would you lie about that?
- Why would you lie about that?

564
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,366
I was afraid that you would punish her.

565
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,701
For playing gin?

566
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,910
It doesn't matter.

567
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,834
The point is, Dr. Fox,
that nothing's happened.

568
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:52,830
- No.
- Hmm?

569
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,248
No! I know what I saw!

570
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,376
- Nothing's happened to anyone.
- No, I was zoomed in with the camera.

571
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,937
- Did you take a picture?
- I did not!

572
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,838
She's just admitted
she's spying on our house.

573
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,733
- Mr. Russell…
- Why didn't you take a picture?

574
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,634
The important thing is,
is that everybody's okay, yeah?

575
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,805
Then where is she?

576
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,432
Where's Jane?

577
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,985
I'm sorry we haven't met.

578
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,323
I'm Jane Russell.

579
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,284
She's not Jane.

580
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,038
I promise I am.

581
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:35,956
No, you're not Jane.

582
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,958
She's not Jane. I know Jane.

583
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,168
Jane's been in my house.

584
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,378
This is absurd.

585
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,961
That's Jane Russell.

586
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:43,923
Get Ethan.

587
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,596
Are you okay, Dr. Fox?

588
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,769
Tell them.

589
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,898
You've never met my mother.

590
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,200
Well, this has been great fun.

591
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,997
See you at the block party.

592
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,214
You made a 911 call yesterday
about an intruder in your house?

593
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,799
No.

594
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,343
I mean, yes. But that was a mistake.

595
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,012
It's a criminal offense
to make false police reports.

596
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,931
Thank you, Detective.

597
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,476
Am I okay to leave you alone, Dr. Fox?

598
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,647
Look, you need anything,
you, um, you call me.

599
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,732
Day or night. Hmm?

600
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,693
I have four kids.

601
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,945
I don't sleep.

602
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,240
Be well, Dr. Fox.

603
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,484
- <i>Why didn't you take a picture?</i>
<i>- I was trying to help her.</i>

604
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,886
<i>Not record it for posterity.
Are you doubting me, too?</i>

605
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,989
- <i>I'm on your side.</i>
<i>- You don't sound like it.</i>

606
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,117
<i>- Understandable they don't believe you.</i>
<i>- Because I didn't take a picture?</i>

607
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,227
<i>Because you're not healthy.</i>
<i>And I'm not sure you're getting better.</i>

608
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,439

I'm trying to reach Alistair Russell.

Hi, Shelly.
I'm trying to reach Alistair Russell

612
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,868

<i>He doesn't work here.</i>

614
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,206
- I thought he transferred to Manhattan.
- <i>Yes, but not with us.</i>

615
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,501
Oh, he left Atkinson?

616
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,671
<i>You could try calling Boston.</i>
<i>I really don't know much about it.</i>

617

Well, it couldn't have
happened very long ago.

00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,560
<i>No, no, it's cool.</i>

644
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,271
<i>I knew her, so maybe I can help.</i>

645
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,023
Oh, um…

646
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,400
What was her job title?

647
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,820
<i>I guess she was</i>
<i>an executive assistant.</i>

648
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,573
<i>Assistant to whom?</i>

649
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,699
<i>Her boss.</i>

650
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,618
<i>Alistair Russell.</i>

651
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,287
Is he still with the company?

652
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,998
<i>What makes you say that?</i>

653
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,878
I see here I have an address.
I know he transferred to Manhattan.

654
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,671
<i>Yeah.</i>

655
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,758
I know that he moved shortly
after Miss Nazin's passing.

656
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,010
<i>If you know that,</i>
<i>then why are you asking?</i>

657
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,682
Oh, I just, um…
With files like this, we like to…

658
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,605
<i>We have questions on cause of death.
We just...</i>

659
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,436
<i>Tell you what.</i>
<i>Give me your number, let me call you back?</i>

660
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,901
<i>Yeah, that's my guy.</i>

661
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:00,656
<i>Yeah, you know, when you have a kid,
you say, "That's my kid, that's my guy,"</i>

662
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,739
<i>like he's yours…</i>

663
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,373
David?

664
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,645
David?

665
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,012
What the…

666
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,138
What are you doing?

667
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:07,889
Jesus.

668
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,434
- Um, I was looking for you.
- What is that?

669
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,855
- Are you going through my mail?
- I'm sorry.

670
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,357
- Unreal.
- I... I... I knocked.

671
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,109
I just… I needed to ask you a question.

672
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,196
Ask me what? Huh?
Here I am, what's your question?

673
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,279
Jane.

674
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,700
Have you met her?
Have you met the woman across the street?

675
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,160
- Jane?
- Jane Russell?

676
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,661
- No.
- You worked with them.

677
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,206
I worked for him. For Mr. Russell.
I never met his wife.

678
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,500
What am I, your messenger now?

679
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,168
Pick up the phone and call him!

680
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,338
Better yet, why don't you take a stroll
across the street!

681
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,421
No?

682
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,800
You seem really upset.

683
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,676
Why would that be, Anna?

684
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,345
Yes, I have a parole problem.

685
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,639
Huh? You wanna read it? Here you go.

686
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,641
- No, it was on the floor.
- I'm in violation.

687
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,477
I'm supposed to be
in Springfield, Massachusetts.

688
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,687
- Okay.
- No, not okay!

689
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,980
It was a bar fight.

690
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,857
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time

691
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,943
and I got fucking jumped and I reacted!

692
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,363
God!

693
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,327
I shouldn't have come down here.

694
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,870
Look, I'm working on it.

695
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,206
I'm going to Connecticut
to see a guy about it.

696
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,748
Okay.

697
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,543
I'm dealing with it.

698
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,048
Why don't we pretend this never happened?

699
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,767
We're cool, right?

700
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,147
Yeah.

701
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,698
Just give me a couple of days
to get on top of it.

702
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,715
David, come on, let's go!

703
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,135
Man, we need to talk about it.

704
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,319
<i>I think you know who I am.</i>

705
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,739
<i>Stop watching our house
or I'll call the police.</i>

706
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,284
<i>Stop watching our house</i>
<i>or I'll call the police.</i>

707
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,382
{\an8}Punch?

708
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,164
Punch?

709
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,264
David?

710
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,731
Punch?

711
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,868
Hey! What are you doing down here?

712
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,371
Poor guy, you've been down here all night.

713
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,624
How did you get down here?

714
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,781
I like your earrings.
Does your husband mind?

715
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,742
<i>I doubt he knows.</i>
<i>A gift from an old boyfriend.</i>

716
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,223
- <i>So now you don't wanna talk.</i>
<i>- I'm busy.</i>

717
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,807
- <i>If I can't say what I think…</i>
<i>- I'm not delusional.</i>

718
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,212
<i>Break it down. First it's the boy,</i>
<i>then tha</i> t <i>murder across the street.</i>

719
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,130
<i>Now there's another woman in Boston…</i>

720
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,424
<i>An earring, and fucking David,
who you always liked.</i>

721
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,402
- <i>You done?</i>
<i>- With you at the center…</i>

722
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,106
- <i>Don't.</i>
<i>- …On all those damn pills.</i>

723
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,056
<i>- Fuck off!</i>
<i>- There's nothing here for you,</i>

724
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,765
<i>you know it. You've got to move on.</i>

725
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,016
- <i>I can't.</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

726
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,227
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I'm just not made that way.</i>

727
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,229
<i>I wish to God I could,
believe me, but I can't.</i>

728
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,397
<i>Everyone else can move on. I can't.</i>

729
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,123
Where's your mother?

730
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,582
Stop it. Stop.

731
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,211
Ethan?

732
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,046
Why are you lying to me?

733
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,967
Can't scream at me on the street.

734
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,529
- I can't help you if you don't tell.
- You never met my mother!

735
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,971
You were lying and you know it.

736
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,140
- You're just confused.
- No, I know what I saw.

737
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,383
You don't. You're just wrong.

738
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,101
I know what I saw!

739
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,145
- You don't! You're wrong!
- We talked about you.

740
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,789
- She told me about you!
- Don't do this!

741
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,398
Why are you lying for him?

742
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,609
Ethan.

743
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,863
Why are you protecting him?

744
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,285
I can't tell you.

745
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,496
Go home!

746
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,960
You…

747
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,962
You cannot slap that boy.

748
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,340
I've put up with a lot, Mrs. Fox,
all of us have, but this…

749
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,176
<i>This</i> stops now.

750
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,179
Your relationship with Ethan,
it's inappropriate.

751
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,972
He's a young man! He's a…

752
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,683
He's a boy! He's 15-and-a-half

753
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,768
and you're a mature woman!

754
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,022
And of course, you're completely
out of your goddamn mind!

755
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,773
I'll call the police!

756
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,233
Go. Go ahead.

757
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,527
Go ahead. I'm sure they'd love
hearing from you.

758
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:21,907
A... A drunken, shut-in,
pill-popping cat lady!

759
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,159
You…

760
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,705
You're fucking with the wrong family.

761
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:35,295
Stay away from my son!

762
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,381
Please!

763
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,101
{\an8}There you are. That's your little kitty.

764
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,464
And there's her little nose.
And all the beautiful flowers.

765
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,091
It's beautiful. It's hopeful.

766
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:00,815
Hey.

767
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,817
You got something in your foot, huh?

768
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,737
You got something in there?

769
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,990
Punch, what is it? Huh?

770
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,158
It's okay.

771
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,016
You don't have any idea
who could've sent you this?

772
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,311
No, the only person
who has a key is my tenant, David.

773
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,479
Yeah, where is he?

774
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,897
I don't know.

775
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,400
- Are you having problems with David?
- No. I mean, no. I…

776
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,944
- Nothing up here.
- You see, coast is clear.

777
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,113
- Can you track the email?
- Track it?

778
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,424
- Or trace it? Whatever.
- You can't track a Gmail account.

779
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,784
- You could've sent this to yourself.
- I'm sleeping.

780
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,954
- Or you wanted to look asleep.
- I'm asleep. What the hell?

781
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,248
Dr. Fox, there is no sign…

782
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,792
That anyone has been here, okay?
Nothing is missing.

783
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,421
- Doors and windows look okay.
- Someone has been in my house.

784
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,131
I have given you proof.

785
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,425
She called my office in Boston!

786
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,678
- Did you know that? She's called my house!
- Damn it! Mr. Russell.

787
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:12,761
Why were you fired?

788
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,431
- She spies on our house!
- All right.

789
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,683
She lured my son into her home!

790
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:17,851
He is abusive.

791
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,061
She is harassing my son.
She is harassing my...

792
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,147
He hit his son. I saw him hit his son.

793
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,314
She's delusional.

794
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,692
Ethan told me, Jane told me,
I saw him do it.

795
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,278
- Um…
- <i>She</i> is Jane!

796
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,657
You are a drunk and a drug addict
and you made it all up!

797
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,452
You almost had me believing that
and then I found this.

798
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,745
What's this?

799
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,623
This is a picture that
your wife drew and signed.

800
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,043
And you call me delusional,
you motherfucker.

801
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,045
- Hey, hey!
- It's you.

802
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,214
She was here.

803
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,468
- That proves it.
- That doesn't prove anything.

804
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,970
That proves you're out of your mind.

805
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,638
What's happening?

806
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,266
Door was open.

807
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,353
- Who are you?
- I live downstairs.

808
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,315
It's my tenant. That's David.

809
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:09,277
- Got a last name, David?
- No. Just David. Like Sting.

810
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,363
It's Winters. His last name is Winters.

811
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,033
It's just Winter, actually. Singular.

812
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,993
Where were you last night, Mr. Winters?

813
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,622
In Connecticut. On a job. Why?

814
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,624
Somebody took a photo
of Dr. Fox in her sleep…

815
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,043
Around 2:00 a.m.
and then e-mailed it to her.

816
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,627
Someone broke in?

817
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,755
How do we know it was last night?

818
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,958
Can anyone confirm
you were in Connecticut last night?

819
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,426
Yeah. The lady I was with.

820
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,552
I'm gonna need her number.

821
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,640
You can call her. Her name is Elizabeth.

822
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,893
Dr. Fox says she saw a woman
assaulted in Mr. Russell's house.

823
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,312
You know anything about that?

824
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,648
- No.
- Have you ever met Mrs. Russell?

825
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,441
No.

826
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:53,112
Her earring is beside your bed
on your nightstand, that little rose.

827
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,572
Jane Russell's earring.

828
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,574
What were you doing
in your tenant's bedroom?

829
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,412
She has some serious privacy issues.

830
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,959
Well… how do you do?

831
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,129
That earring belongs to a woman I know.

832
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,090
And who is that woman?

833
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,633
Her name is Katherine.

834
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,927
She spent the night here last week.

835
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,889
You took a box cutter from me.

836
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,599
You loaned it to me.

837
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,893
Checks out. He was in Darien last night.

838
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,899
He was in prison for assault.

839
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,694
He was in prison.
He shouldn't be in New York.

840
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:36,489
He's been in her house.
He must have met her.

841
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:43,705
Her earring is beside his bed
and he borrowed a knife from me,

842
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,331
and he's been in prison.

843
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:51,004
And he was fired from his job.

844
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,756
His assistant died.

845
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,802
He threatened me.

846
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,345
In my home.

847
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,015
He beats his child.

848
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,891
I'm a child psychologist.

849
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,604
I know how to identify
a child who's in danger,

850
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,938
who's being abused.

851
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:13,610
And I saw Alistair slap Ethan
in my home yesterday.

852
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,988
Wait... W...

853
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,824
Yes, yes. Yesterday.

854
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,493
I see…

855
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,123
I see the way
that you're all looking at me.

856
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,752
I'm not crazy.

857
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,756
I'm not hallucinating.
Do I seem unreasonable?

858
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,467
I have evidence.

859
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:42,430
There was that picture
that Jane drew and she signed,

860
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,725
and there's a photograph
that somebody took of me

861
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,060
while I was sleeping.

862
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,481
Look, it doesn't matter
what you think about me,

863
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,109
if you approve of me,
if you think that I'm reliable.

864
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:59,113
There is a boy in danger in that house.

865
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,782
Just help him, please.

866
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,242
You're a father.

867
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,998
I would think that you would want
to help a child.

868
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,335
If my husband were here…

869
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,671
He would help.

870
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,465
He would believe me.

871
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,510
Dr. Fox, your family is dead.

872
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,680
I don't know how
you can live with yourself

873
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:27,684
if you let something happen to a child.

874
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,481
I'm sorry,
but your family is dead.

875
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,865
Do you like the mountains, Livy?

876
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,201
<i>They look like a giant's bed.</i>

877
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,495
Like a giant,
sleeping under a white blanket.

878
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,706
You're gonna ski in those tomorrow.

879
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,500
That one looks like a horse.

880
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,460
What would you name a horse if we got one?

881
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,337
I'd call him Vixen.

882
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,131
A vixen is a fox.

883
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,634
It's a girl fox, sweetheart.

884
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,971
What would you call
a horse, Mommy?

885
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,556
"Of course, of course."

886
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,439
It's an old TV show.

887
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,403
I can't do it this way.

888
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:21,987
Do what?

889
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,618
Do what?

890
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,330
This.

891
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,792
This happy family vacation.

892
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,046
You and I spoke in painful detail

893
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,925
and I thought that we agreed
that we would not ruin Christmas.

894
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,929
And I can't do it anymore. I can't.

895
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,308
The acting is foolish.

896
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,143
It doesn't dignify our daughter.

897
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,813
You don't care if she gets upset?

898
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,941
She should be upset. It's upsetting.

899
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,952
Well, don't blame me
if she's scarred for life.

900
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,825
I do blame you.

901
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:08,951
You're to blame.

902
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,372
The one fucking
the other person is to blame.

903
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:25,927
You wanna answer it?

904
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,226
I bet that's him.

905
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,438
I'll answer it.

906
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,523
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

907
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,864
Anna!

908
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,051
I'm sorry, but…

909
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:08,970
Your family is dead.

910
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,913
Ed? Ed!

911
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:22,709
Livy?

912
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,421
Livy?

913
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:26,839
Olivia?

914
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,675
Come on, baby.

915
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,052
I got you. Come on.

916
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,435
Olivia.

917
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,561
Olivia.

918
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,522
Wake up.

919
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,606
Wake up!

920
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,474
I talked to your doctor, Dr. Landy.

921
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,978
And you have had a hell of a time.

922
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:26,440
And I think you actually believe
that you met this lady

923
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,943
just like how you believe
you're talking to your family.

924
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:34,240
Your doctor said that your meds
can cause hallucinations.

925
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,909
Maybe that's okay by you.

926
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,746
I know it'd be okay by me.

927
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,498
- Jane Russell…
- Yeah, she, uh…

928
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,250
She checks out.

929
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,877
This lady here, from 101…

930
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,548
She is who she says she is.

931
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,633
She is Jane Russell.

932
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,303
- Now, as for what you saw that night...
- Um…

933
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,599
I'm so, so sorry.

934
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,480
Of course…

935
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,649
Your wife is who she says she is.

936
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:10,609
Of course she is.

937
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,361
Of course…

938
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,445
You are.

939
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,574
I'm really sorry that I involved you in…

940
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,534
All of this.

941
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,497
I'm so sorry
that I mixed Ethan up in this.

942
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,214
I don't… I don't know…

943
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,635
What you must think.

944
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,387
All of you.

945
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,691
I understand…

946
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,236
{\an8}If you want to recommend…

947
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,322
{\an8}Supervision.

948
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,122
I'm listening.

949
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:11,921
I've been slipping.

950
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,342
Slipping on my meds.

951
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,886
Drinking.

952
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,765
Getting into a really…

953
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,896
Dark frame of mind
and I'm not sharing that with you.

954
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,155
That's a hard thing to admit.

955
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:44,370
Well, it feels good to say.

956
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,789
And to hear.

957
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,461
I don't think that the Elevan
is good for me.

958
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,925
- No.
- Not if you're hallucinating, no.

959
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,177
I wouldn't think, no, no.

960
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,806
And there's some mania, too.

961
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:12,273
I just really needed to be
at the center of something.

962
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,278
I needed a wake-up call.

963
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,410
You got very lucky with that detective.

964
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,122
You realize how
this could've gone differently.

965
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,460
I just wanna turn it around.

966
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,883
I had no idea about David.

967
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,635
Well, that was a mess.

968
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,429
- Is he here?
- No, no.

969
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,512
He's…

970
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,266
Gonna come back this afternoon and…

971
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,144
Pick up the last of his stuff.

972
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,897
Which leaves you here alone.

973
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,985
You don't think it's paranoid
if I wanna change the locks, do you?

974
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,112
There's gonna have to be somebody here.

975
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:05,117
And then you and I are gonna go back
to three sessions a week.

976
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:07,952
Okay.

977
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,195
<i>I'm Anna Fox.</i>

978
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,824
<i>Uh, today is, um…</i>

979
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:11,702
<i>Monday. November 6th.</i>

980
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,872
<i>And I'm making this video…</i>

981
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,540
<i>Making…</i>

982
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,128
<i>I'm Anna Fox, and I'm at 104…</i>

983
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:25,382
<i>West 121st Street in Manhattan, New York.</i>

984
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,595
<i>And I am, uh, making this video…</i>

985
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:32,514
<i>As my final will and testament.</i>

986
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:37,353
Randy Turo, that's a lawyer.

987
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,104
He has a written will…

988
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,149
That Ed and I did together.

989
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:45,027
After, um…

990
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,030
Olivia was born.

991
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,283
And I'm not gonna be…

992
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:54,286
Making any, like,
super-significant changes…

993
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:57,706
Super… Super…

994
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,416
Fuck, really?

995
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:04,505
<i>The point of me doing this
is that there's no, um…</i>

996
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,091
<i>Confusion…</i>

997
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,593
<i>About, um,</i>

998
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,553
my soundness of mind.

999
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:17,643
My state of mind.

1000
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:20,896
<i>I... I...
I especially wanna make sure that, um…</i>

1001
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,649
<i>That you know that David Winters</i>

1002
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,944
<i>has absolutely
nothing to do with my death.</i>

1003
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:28,904
<i>In fact, I'm waiting for him to come…</i>

1004
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,991
<i>To come and to get his stuff…</i>

1005
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,202
<i>So that I can, um…</i>

1006
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:40,958
Go through with it.

1007
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,181
Go through with it…

1008
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,310
<i>I just wish I could be forgiven.</i>

1009
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:06,859
<i>I really…</i>

1010
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,237
<i>Wish I could just be forgiven.</i>

1011
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,243
<i>I want to go back.</i>

1012
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,581
<i>I want to do it over.</i>

1013
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,919
<i>I want to do it different.</i>

1014
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,009
<i>And I can't.</i>

1015
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,140
<i>And I can't.</i>

1016
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:45,731
I can't!

1017
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,481
<i>Punch.</i>

1018
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,775
<i>Punch. Punch.</i>

1019
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:44,748
Okay.

1020
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,086
Hello?

1021
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:00,889
Hello?

1022
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,099
Sorry.

1023
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:07,062
Tried to call. I just need to get
my umbrella and my gloves.

1024
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,480
Can you come up?

1025
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,982
Uh, just for a moment.

1026
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,275
I'm soaking wet.

1027
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,238
I had a long day
and it's not about to end soon.

1028
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,362
Please. It'll just take a minute.

1029
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,211
Thank you.

1030
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,296
For what?

1031
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,552
I wanna show you…

1032
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:39,635
A picture.

1033
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,693
The face in the wine glass.

1034
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:57,779
Yeah, I see it.

1035
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,909
That is the woman that I saw murdered.

1036
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,078
She said that her name was Jane Russell!

1037
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,669
Her name is Katie.

1038
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,713
What?

1039
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:18,008
Ethan, the son…

1040
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:20,135
She is the birth mother.

1041
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,556
You spent the night with her.

1042
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:26,725
Wednesday. One night.

1043
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:29,853
She was a total disaster.
Why do you think I bailed?

1044
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:33,106
I spent the night on a couch in Astoria
on Thursday night

1045
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,870
just so I don't have
to run into her again.

1046
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:38,153
She ran away on him
when she was eight months pregnant.

1047
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,822
Disappeared.
Alistair spent two years chasing her down…

1048
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,586
And found her in some Oregon meth commune.

1049
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,660
He took the boy, she went to prison.

1050
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,912
- See how I changed the subject on you?
- I did.

1051
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,456
You don't know who you're fooling with.

1052
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,627
They told you this?

1053
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,129
She did. She wouldn't shut up.

1054
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,675
They've been hiding from her for years.
She found out they were living in Boston.

1055
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:01,385
He's been paying her to stay away.

1056
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,471
Why did she tell me
her name is Jane Russell?

1057
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:05,597
You're Jane Russell.

1058
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,723
You're Jane Russell.

1059
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,892
What makes you say that?

1060
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:11,478
Your son came by. Ethan.

1061
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:14,898
<i>I saw her murdered.</i>

1062
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,611
Whatever you say, Anna.

1063
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,695
Yeah.

1064
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,616
I showed you… the picture.

1065
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:28,036
Yeah, looking very much alive.

1066
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,329
She's real.

1067
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,834
And I need you
to go to the police with me.

1068
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:39,297
No.

1069
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,590
No, no.

1070
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:41,674
David!

1071
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,553
You can't just run away from this!

1072
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,430
Watch me.

1073
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,223
Oh, shit! Please, David!

1074
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:50,892
Oh, shit!

1075
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:09,285
David?

1076
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:35,645
Oh, my God!

1077
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,398
You know what's so great about this?

1078
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,735
Everyone thinks
I'm in New Hampshire right now.

1079
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:45,113
They call it a wilderness program
but it's really a prison.

1080
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,407
I was supposed to go last month

1081
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,993
but they had a fire or something.

1082
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,915
We never had a chance to say goodbye.

1083
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,666
David!

1084
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,961
The trick is to run away
before you get there.

1085
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,713
What did you do? David!

1086
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:02,839
He's dead.

1087
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:04,674
You killed him.

1088
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,927
- No. What?
- It's your knife.

1089
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:10,597
Your house. Just the two of you.

1090
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,849
What did you do?

1091
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,351
He deserved it.

1092
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:17,229
He slept with my mom
and got her all pissed off.

1093
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,563
And then threw her out.

1094
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:22,901
She might have just gone away
if he'd left her alone.

1095
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,821
Then maybe none of this
would have happened.

1096
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:29,324
Don't scream, Anna.

1097
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,993
That'll just be bad for everyone.

1098
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,373
Take a deep breath.

1099
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:41,002
That's what they're always
telling me to do.

1100
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,046
Self-management coping skills.

1101
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:48,301
Good. We can breathe together.

1102
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,185
Why are you so freaked out?

1103
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,937
You're killing yourself anyway, right?

1104
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,317
No. No.

1105
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:09,030
I thought it was a really nice video.

1106
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:13,034
How did you get into my house?

1107
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:17,122
'Cause you're so vigilant about your keys.

1108
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,332
And sober. Right.

1109
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,003
I've been in here all week.

1110
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:25,672
You killed your mother.

1111
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:33,930
That bothers you, right?

1112
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:36,641
You feel for her?

1113
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:39,561
You and Katie…

1114
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:42,230
One job to do.

1115
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:45,692
One fucking thing.

1116
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:50,280
Take care of your family, right?

1117
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:52,616
Both of you.

1118
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,118
And what do you do?

1119
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:59,831
The real estate lady
who sold my dad the house,

1120
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,209
she talked about you and what happened.

1121
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,921
And I couldn't stop thinking

1122
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,174
what a perfect next person
you were for me.

1123
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,844
I knew exactly what you would like.

1124
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:17,098
Is that a talent or a skill…

1125
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:18,850
To know that…

1126
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,562
In your professional opinion?

1127
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,318
Okay, see? Now you don't like me anymore.

1128
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,321
Is that what happened in Boston…

1129
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:34,658
With you and Pam? She got sick of you?

1130
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,411
Pam liked everything I did.

1131
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,705
You don't seem very sure about it.

1132
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,791
She was just a place to start.

1133
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:45,001
I'm still figuring things out.

1134
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,545
- What does that mean?
- I don't have a pattern yet.

1135
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,464
- Pattern of?
- Of this!

1136
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,217
I have so many choices, right?

1137
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:56,137
What do I wanna be when I grow up?

1138
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:00,642
I know I like being there
when it happens, feeling it.

1139
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:07,857
Pam took about five minutes to die
after she hit the ground.

1140
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,404
If you hadn't found that picture of Katie,

1141
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,073
I was just gonna come in at the very end

1142
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,324
and say goodbye.

1143
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:19,953
You could pretend that I'm not even here.

1144
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,085
I just wanna watch you go.

1145
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:31,715
Okay.

1146
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,094
You know what, fuck it.

1147
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:38,471
You wanna watch?

1148
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:51,067
Because a world with you in it…

1149
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,154
Where you exist…

1150
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,948
Is a world of filth.

1151
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,538
No, I'm done.

1152
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:16,676
I don't wanna breathe that air.

1153
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,980
Anna!

1154
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:35,505
Anna!

1155
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,717
Stop fighting me!

1156
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:32,562
You don't even wanna live anymore!

1157
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:35,523
You haven't wanted to live
for a long time!

1158
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,702
Here we go!

1159
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:50,537
No!

1160
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:13,203
Hey.

1161
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:17,083
Hey, I was just gonna leave a message.

1162
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,380
Were you here before?

1163
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,215
Yeah. And they, um…

1164
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,301
They told me not to wake you, so…

1165
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:28,969
Are you in pain?

1166
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:31,806
I should be, right?

1167
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:35,893
Hey, just don't stay on that shit too long
'cause it feels way too good.

1168
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:40,106
David's dead?

1169
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:42,941
Yeah.

1170
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:45,820
I'm sorry.

1171
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,657
But, uh, we have the Russells in custody.

1172
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:54,329
He isn't sayin' a word, but Jane,
she won't stop talking, so…

1173
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:58,624
We have Katherine Melli's body.

1174
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,626
We found it in Fort Lee.

1175
01:29:02,545 --> 01:29:04,422
Means you were right
about everything you saw.

1176
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:08,426
And we messed up, and you're gonna get
a lot of apologies from a lot of people.

1177
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:11,304
And I just wanted
to be here to be the first.

1178
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:14,473
I'm sorry.

1179
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:17,059
Thank you.

1180
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:24,567
I saw your video.

1181
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:35,453
So, look, um, Detective Norelli,

1182
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:38,414
I hope you don't mind,
she's got Punch at her house.

1183
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:42,210
Whenever you're ready to get out of here,
she's happy to give her back...

1184
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:44,128
So, everybody's seen the video?

1185
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,840
At this point…

1186
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:51,843
No.

1187
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,223
No, no, no. Um…

1188
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:59,394
We're actually having a little trouble
locating the phone.

1189
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:04,357
Yeah, I think that somehow
the phone ended up here with you,

1190
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,985
and when I come back
and ask you about it in an hour…

1191
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:11,406
You hand it over.

1192
01:30:14,033 --> 01:30:16,536
Get rid of anything on there
that you don't want out, okay?

1193
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:20,372
Really?

1194
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,129
Look, I messed up this case
so bad already.

1195
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:28,339
I don't think one more thing
is gonna hurt me, right?

1196
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:39,308
Just be straight up with me.

1197
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:46,232
I'm not gonna have
to worry about you, right?

1198
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,282
Right.

1199
01:31:58,304 --> 01:31:59,555
I have to go now.

1200
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,609
I miss you.

1201
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,401
You ready?

1202
01:32:53,484 --> 01:32:55,486
Huh? Hmm?

1203
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:59,198
All right.

1204
01:33:00,157 --> 01:33:01,784
Okay, it won't be long.

1205
01:33:01,867 --> 01:33:05,538
Come on, come on. Come.

1206
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,456
Good boy.

1206
01:33:09,305 --> 01:34:09,876
