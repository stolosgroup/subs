2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,610
I don't know, man,
I saw it like I see you.

3
00:00:08,643 --> 00:00:10,778
It was a huge object,
like a bright light.

4
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:12,379
Stayed in the sky, not moving.

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,416
Hallelujah, and never forget,

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,586
always listen
to the voice of the Lord.

7
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:23,825
The two girls were stabbed
two hours apart,

8
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,292
and their attacker
fled the scene

9
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,661
before the police arrived.

I'm lost.

Well, it sure seems that way.

30
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,460
If you like, I could
drop you off somewhere.

31
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,262
- I'm good.
- You sure?

32
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,699
We're literally
in the middle of nowhere.

33
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,168
I'm fine, I'll walk.

34
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,772
Suit yourself, but it's
a good six or seven miles

35
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,708
to the nearest gas station.

36
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:22,376
At least it's simple.

37
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,645
Just keep going straight.

38
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:31,719

What do you do for a living?

46
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,478
Waitress. Kitts Rock.

47
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,615
I know that place,
it's a cool bar.

48
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,851
I suppose.

49
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,485
You?

50
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,022
I'm a night watchman.

51
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:45,827
The most boring job
in the universe.

52
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,796
But, you know,
it pays the bills,

53
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,997
and no one is there
to hassle me.

54
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,967
I, uh, I don't like people.

55
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,438
I know how you feel.

56
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,575
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:05,947
I'm Adam.

58
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,050
Lisa.

59
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,819
I like your accent.

60
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:13,353
Europe?

61
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,823
France.

62
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:17,925
Cute.

63
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,527
So are you here
on a holiday or...

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,630
Are you a night watchman
or a cop?

65
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:27,702
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,009
Crying is for kids and losers.

67
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,379
The asshole
who called himself my dad

68
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,582
always used to say that to me.

69
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,819
Difficult childhood?

70
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,354
Oh, you have no idea.

71
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,456
No idea.

72
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,794
Well, that's one thing
we have in common.

73
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,299
You have kids?

74
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:03,104
Today's my daughter's birthday.

75
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,973
- How old is she?
- Nine.

76
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:11,045
She would have been nine today.

77
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:17,084
Is that why you were
laying in the road?

78
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,891
I don't want to die.

79
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,795
I just want to see
my daughter again.

80
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,768
There's nothing after this.

81
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,638
We're all alone.

82
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:39,941
All the time.

83
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,951
The suspect has not yet
been formally identified,

84
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:52,553
and the police have confirmed
that the two murders

85
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:54,689
that took place this morning
are linked.

86
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,390
The suspect is a white male
with short hair.

87
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,927
He has a tattoo of a cross
on his right hand

88
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:02,163
and was last seen
driving a brown truck.

89
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,565
The bodies of the victims
were covered with terrible...

90
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:19,463
MEANDER

91
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,178
Ah.

92
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:35,923
Help!

93
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,592
Help!

94
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,063
Help!

95
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,276
Let me out!

96
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,078
Let me out!

97
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,264
Let me out!

98
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,158
Oh! No, no, no, no!

99
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,886
Fuck, what is this?
What the hell is this?

100
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,379
No, no.

101
00:12:58,412 --> 00:12:59,980
No.

102
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,204
No!

103
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,928
I can't.

104
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:55,349
I just want to go home.

105
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:44,666
Hey.

106
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:48,151
Is someone there?

107
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,003
Oh, shit. Shit!

108
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,644
Okay.

109
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:12,807
No!

110
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,980
No, no, no, no, no.

111
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,453
I can't take it anymore.

112
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:40,170
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it anymore.

113
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:47,344
I can't... I can't do it.

114
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:36,430
- Hey.
- Come here, I'm here!

115
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,534
Ah! Oh! Oh!

116
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:05,385
Okay.

117
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,580
I'm almost there.

118
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:40,447
Come here!

119
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,483
Please!

120
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:50,892
Come here!

121
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:52,894
Help me!

122
00:35:05,907 --> 00:35:07,508
Hey!

123
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:27,895
Help me, please!

124
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,936
Help me.

125
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:41,676
- Hey.
- Help!

126
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:43,210
Help.

127
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:45,479
I can't get through.

128
00:35:45,513 --> 00:35:48,683
- We're stuck.
- Help me!

129
00:35:48,716 --> 00:35:51,284
We have to stay calm
and find a solution.

130
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,854
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

131
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:56,891
I'm s... so sorry.

132
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:57,859
It's okay.

133
00:35:57,892 --> 00:35:59,493
It's not your fault.

134
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:01,194
We haven't done anything.

135
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,269
Hey! Look at me.

136
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:12,840
I haven't gone through
all this shit to give up now.

137
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:16,376
Whoever put us in here
wants us to die like rats.

138
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,713
We have to help each other.

139
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:19,747
Right?

140
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:24,786
Please help me.

141
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:27,287
What is there on your side?

142
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,923
On my side?

143
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:31,659
Nothing!

144
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:34,762
The tube! The fucking tube!

145
00:36:34,796 --> 00:36:37,330
That's what's on my side!

146
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:39,433
Just tube!

147
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:44,806
You've been here for longer
than me, right?

148
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,242
I've got to be quiet.

149
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:54,015
Shh.

150
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,586
You remember anything?

151
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:05,392
They're gonna come back.

152
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:07,360
They're gonna kill you.

153
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,764
Who?

154
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:10,965
Who is they?

155
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,036
Oh, we're gonna die,
we're gonna die!

156
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:16,504
We're gonna die!

157
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:18,005
Oh, we're gonna die!

158
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,006
We're gonna die.

159
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,942
Oh, we're gonna die!

160
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:22,977
You're gonna die!

161
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,714
You're gonna die, you bitch!

162
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:00,648
Get out, bitch!

163
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,884
Get out!

164
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,463
No!

165
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,115
Look out!

166
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:35,082
You're gonna die, you bitch!

167
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,359
My hand!

168
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:49,030
My hand!

169
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,936
You cut...

170
00:38:56,904 --> 00:38:58,706
Adam.

171
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,079
No.

172
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:10,971
Why are you doing this?

173
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:40,001
No! Arrêt!

174
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:55,200
You don't want me to die.

175
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:41,330
A diamond, a cross, a diamond.
What does it mean?

176
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:45,167
What does it mean?

177
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:00,732
What was it?

178
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:09,992
Diamond, cross, diamond.

179
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:11,952
Diamond...

180
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,243
It's her.

181
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:56,038
I know it's her.

182
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:00,702
Nina?

183
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:03,705
Nina?

184
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:51,719
Papa.

185
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:24,501
It's me. I remember that.

186
00:52:18,673 --> 00:52:20,207
Nina?

187
00:52:24,712 --> 00:52:26,313
Nina!

188
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,226
No...

189
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,080
I'm sorry.

190
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:28,625
I wasn't there.
I wasn't there for you.

191
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:10,425
Stop.

192
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:21,061
Let me go.

193
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:25,816
Let me be.

194
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,615
Let me be.

195
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:12,779
Wait.

196
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:27,711
Left, right, right, left,

197
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:30,881
left, right. They're arrows.

198
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:53,445
It's under my bracelet.

199
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,459
Won't you help me take it off?

200
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,584
It needs to work.

201
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:00,739
Right, left, right, left, left,

202
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:05,202
right. Right, left, right,
left, left, left, right.

203
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:37,526
Alright, I need to go right.

204
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:05,637
Left.

205
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,158
Right.

206
01:06:52,513 --> 01:06:56,016
Right, left, right, left, left.

207
01:06:58,143 --> 01:06:59,728
Shit.

208
01:14:35,559 --> 01:14:36,685
Mom?

209
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:44,610
Where were you?
Why did you leave me all alone?

210
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:57,039
Don't you love me anymore?

211
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:11,845
I'm so sorry.

212
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:15,307
Don't cry, mom.

213
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:19,061
We'll stay together.

214
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,105
- We'll stick together.
- Yes.

215
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,953
Forget about time, mom.
Come.

216
01:15:36,828 --> 01:15:37,955
Come with me.

217
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:43,752
Come, mom, follow me!

218
01:15:45,462 --> 01:15:48,799
- It's this way.
- No. Wait.

219
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:53,220
What's wrong, mom?

220
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:11,738
I don't want to lose you.

221
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:28,338
But you're not real.

222
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:31,425
Mom.

223
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,553
Mom!

224
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:36,805
Mom, stay with me!

225
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:44,229
Mom, stay with me!
Forget about time!

226
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:46,940
Mom! Mom!

227
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:15,427
This is my way.

228
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:18,764
That's where I need to go.

229
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:22,434
I can't come with you.

230
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:37,991
Does it mean we're never
going to see each other again?

231
01:17:56,677 --> 01:17:58,679
I'm proud of you, Lisa.

232
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:01,932
We all are.

233
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:33,172
I made it.

234
01:19:02,326 --> 01:19:03,827
"Forget about time."

235
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:10,626
I don't need you anymore.

236
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:30,229
Two, three, four.

237
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:34,691
One, two, three, four.

238
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:48,205
One, two, three...

239
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:51,750
One, two, three...

240
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:03,220
It's impossible!

241
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:12,396
One, two...

242
01:20:13,063 --> 01:20:14,606
One, two...

243
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:50,536
I did everything
you wanted me to do.

244
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:02,840
I had no chance.

245
01:22:11,723 --> 01:22:13,308
But I made it to the end.

246
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:20,357
I did it. I did it.

247
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:28,407
I did it.

248
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:09,985
Did I die?

249
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:14,239
Your body did. Many times.

250
01:25:15,574 --> 01:25:17,910
But there's nothing left to fear, now.

251
01:25:18,744 --> 01:25:20,621
You're safe, here.

252
01:25:28,795 --> 01:25:30,172
What do I have to do?

253
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:36,637
Live.

254
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:49,481
