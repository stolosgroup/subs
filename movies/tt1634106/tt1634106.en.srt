00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:02,162
<i>Go for
comms, Delta Two. Sitrep.</i>

3
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:05,700
<i>Ain't looking
good, LT. Soup sandwich in here.</i>

4
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,434
<i>Four hostages down.</i>

5
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:11,539
<i>Looks like
they interrogated them</i>

6
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:13,273
<i>and dumped the bodies here.</i>

7
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,577
<i>Echo Two, give me a sitrep.</i>

8
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,981
<i>No sign
of alpha target. Moving location.</i>

9
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:49,911
Contact, building two,
ground floor.

10
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,497
<i>Bravo Six, hold on breach.</i>

11
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,169
<i>Roger that. Breaching now.</i>

12
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,809
<i>Delta, Echo, hustle.
Double time.</i>

13
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:24,277
<i>Bravo's on location.
Goddamn it, Bravo Six,</i>

14
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,813
<i>I said, hold on breach!</i>

15
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,863
Drop your gun.

16
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:18,398
I said, drop your gun!

17
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,408
All right.

18
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,411
Take it easy.

19
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,583
What do you want?

20
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,284
Helicopter. Now!

21
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,886
<i>On location. Building two.</i>

22
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,488
And tell them to back off!

23
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,692
Alpha One, stand down.
We got this situation handled.

24
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:46,027
<i>Roger that. Holding.</i>

25
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,696
If you want a helicopter,

26
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,330
you gotta give me a phone.

27
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:54,102
- There.
- Where?

28
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,570
There.

29
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,954
<i>Bravo Six in sight.
Alpha target secure.</i>

30
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,635
Why do these flights
always feel so long?

31
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:33,608
That's what we fight for, guys.

32
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,643
Oh, man, I need to get home.

33
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:38,579
No mission too difficult,
no sacrifice too great!

34
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,480
Duty first!

35
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,417
That's it! To the hangar.

36
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:50,423
Boss, I'll take that for you.

37
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,195
You think someday...

38
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,566
just once, you could come back
in the same shape you left?

39
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,903
You don't like my scars?

40
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,975
I don't mind the scars.

41
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,545
I just don't like
the stories they tell.

42
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:23,483
You know the funny thing
about the stories they tell?

43
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,987
Is they all end the same.

44
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,955
I always come home.

45
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,192
Just saying,

46
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,127
at some point,

47
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,730
your body can't do this forever.

48
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:44,272
Are you questioning
what my body can and can't do?

49
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:51,545
Well, maybe I just need
a little reeducation.

50
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:33,254
Baby?

51
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,323
Oh, shit.

52
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,429
Gina.

53
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,601
What's your problem?

54
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,188
You all right, mate?

55
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,193
Yeah.

56
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,400
Never gets old.

57
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,337
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

58
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm the bloke
that ruined your vacation.

59
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:11,445
Name's Martin Axe.

60
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,149
So that's one for you.
Now one for me.

61
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,719
Who tipped you off
about the hostages in Mombasa?

62
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:23,457
Right, yeah.

63
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:25,259
I thought you might clam up.

64
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,761
That's why I brought
a little extra motivation.

65
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:38,105
Look who it is.

66
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:45,012
- Who's that?
- Gina.

67
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:49,950
Hey.

68
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,953
She has nothing to do with this.

69
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:55,456
Once again, then.

70
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,857
Who tipped you off?

71
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,359
I don't know, man.

72
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,295
That's not my job.
I go where they point me.

73
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,775
Can she handle all six inches?

74
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,443
Why am I asking you, eh?

75
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:20,114
Hey, look at me.

76
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,683
Look at me!

77
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:26,053
I don't... I can't answer
because I don't know.

78
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,155
If I knew, I would tell you!

79
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:30,357
I don't know!

80
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,661
You could ask me anything,
anything else,

81
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,196
but this I can't tell you
because I don't know.

82
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,406
Yeah, I believe you.

83
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:50,010
Ray. Ray. Ray.

84
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,416
- Ray.
- It's gonna be okay.

85
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,090
Bad news, baby.

86
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,560
It's not gonna be okay.

87
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,565
- No! No!
- No, no, no.

88
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,761
Oh, you're nothing.

89
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,430
You don't even exist anymore.

90
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:47,001
I swear, I will find you
and end you!

91
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,273
You should kill me now

92
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,609
because you won't have
a second chance.

93
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:56,844
I promise you.

94
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:02,950
Thanks for the advice.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

102
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,140
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
You're okay.

103
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,410
It's gonna be fine. It's okay.

104
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:38,847
Where am I?

105
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,238
Awake and cognitive.

106
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,473
This is... This is phenomenal.

107
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,644
Do I know you guys?

108
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:12,614
I don't think so.
Welcome to RST,

109
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:15,784
Rising Spirit Technologies.
I'm Dr. Emil Harting.

110
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,953
This is my facility
and my colleague, KT.

111
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,389
- Katie.
- Initials, KT.

112
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,426
Will you look at me, please?

113
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,131
Dilation looks good. No sign
of sub-macular hemorrhaging.

114
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,066
There's no redness. Very clear.

115
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,905
All right, what happened to me?
What am I doing here?

116
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,072
Tell me,
do you remember anything?

117
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,974
Anything's kind of broad,
don't you think?

118
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,811
Of course. Let's keep it simple.

119
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,313
What about your name,
rank, serial number?

120
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,248
Of course.

121
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:51,285
My name is...

122
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,926
Rank, serial number?

123
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:03,096
Yes, your body was donated
by the U.S. military.

124
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,465
My body?

125
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:07,201
It was either us
or Arlington, I'm afraid.

126
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,539
Arlington, doc?

127
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:15,510
I got some scars, but I'm not
ready for the cemetery.

128
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,512
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

129
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:19,681
but you got yourself killed.

130
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,654
Okay.

131
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:29,958
I'll play along.

132
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,927
But if I died...

133
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,496
somebody's waiting
for me to call them.

134
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,766
Somebody must be waiting
for me to come home.

135
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,769
Uh...

136
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:44,171
It's difficult for me
to tell you this. Um...

137
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,508
More difficult than
telling someone they died?

138
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,545
- Um...
- Well, the military

139
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,881
only anonymously donates
remains of soldiers

140
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:57,251
who weren't claimed by family.

141
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,588
Sorry. Sometimes you just
gotta rip off the Band-Aid.

142
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:03,490
Helps to get through the pain
a bit quicker.

143
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,362
But you don't need a history
to have a future.

144
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,397
Listen to me. You're the first

145
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:13,066
we've successfully managed
to bring back.

146
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,737
And it has worked beautifully.

147
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,506
You have been given something
that nobody else has.

148
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,876
A second chance.

149
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,748
A second chance.

150
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:34,689
Whoa. Heh.

151
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:37,057
Ain't what I was expecting.

152
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:40,895
What are we doing
all the way out here, doc?

153
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:47,835
RST focuses on rebuilding

154
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:50,572
the most important asset
in the U.S. military,

155
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:53,575
soldiers just like yourself.

156
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,578
We are explorers
on a new frontier.

157
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:59,581
We develop everything
from exoskeletal reconstruction,

158
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:02,082
which makes soldiers
faster and stronger,

159
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,118
to neural prosthetics, which
enhance the way they react.

160
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,822
But you, my friend,

161
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:10,090
you are the proof
that we are leading the way

162
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,493
in the greatest human
advancement of all time.

163
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,228
Come, I'll show you.

164
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,944
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

165
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,714
The hell, doc?

166
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:39,286
Holy shit.

167
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:46,259
Let me explain.

168
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:49,897
If you would
place your hand here, please.

169
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:52,499
Now, look at this.

170
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,372
Now, what the hell
are those things?

171
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,207
Biomechanical constructs.

172
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,876
<i>We call them "nanites."</i>

173
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,446
<i>They intuitively enhance
your biology.</i>

174
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:08,850
<i>Most notably,
they react very quickly</i>

175
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,450
<i>to catastrophic injury,</i>

176
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:12,787
<i>rebuilding damaged tissue.</i>

177
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,329
- So those are in my blood?
- They are your blood.

178
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:25,198
We had some success applying
them to single organ systems.

179
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,801
We thought it was time to try

180
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:30,605
- a full-body transfusion.
- Of course you did.

181
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:32,540
Just like our own bodies
need calories,

182
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:34,474
the nanites need
their own energy.

183
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,943
And this lab supplies that.

184
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:37,545
The more effort they make,

185
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,346
the more energy they consume.

186
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,382
- What's that glow?
- That's heat being generated

187
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:44,952
by the nanites
battling malignant cancer,

188
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:46,453
trying to save that mouse.

189
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:51,859
The mouse that just died?

190
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:54,862
Admittedly, some of the early
results were suboptimal.

191
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:57,565
Maybe we should fast-forward
to the optimal part.

192
00:19:57,699 --> 00:19:59,834
That's you.
You're the optimal part.

193
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,003
Because now we have
the ability to recharge

194
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,403
when they're running low.

195
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:08,776
Why can't I remember
anything about me?

196
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,847
Because of who you were
and what you did.

197
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,916
Sadly, everything about you
is classified.

198
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,952
And that was all in your past.
This is your future.

199
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:21,889
Listen, when I was a boy,
I was a tennis champion.

200
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:24,726
And then when I was 15,
I got cancer.

201
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,594
They took my arm
within six months.

202
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,663
Instead of dwelling
on what I'd lost,

203
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,065
I chose to focus
on who I could become.

204
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,902
And so now, when a soldier
loses his arm,

205
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,204
he gets a better one.

206
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:42,710
This is our rehab facility,

207
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:46,748
where patients come to test the
limits of their augmentations.

208
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:49,917
You've already met KT,
ex-Navy swimmer.

209
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:52,086
She was part of
a rescue deployment in Syria

210
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,588
during a chemical attack.

211
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:56,124
One laryngeal tracheal
reconstruction later

212
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,727
and she now breathes through
a clavicle-mounted respirator.

213
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,629
Makes her totally immune
to inhalants.

214
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:04,665
Tibbs here graduated

215
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,601
from Fort Benning,
top of his class.

216
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:09,670
He became one of the Army's
most successful marksmen

217
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:12,305
until an Iraqi mortar
took his sight.

218
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,176
We've since remedied that
with ocular prosthetics.

219
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:19,814
Gear-mounted camera arrays feed
directly into his optic nerves.

220
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,250
- Which means now he sees...
- Everything.

221
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,253
Welcome to the circus.

222
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,288
And finally, Jimmy Dalton,
ex-Navy SEAL.

223
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,125
Jimmy lost both his feet
to an Afghan IED,

224
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:33,293
so we engineered him a new set.

225
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,263
Part of Team Six.
Took out bin Laden.

226
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,497
You and every other Navy SEAL.

227
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,501
So we're wounded warriors.

228
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:42,069
Not wounded.

229
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:45,139
Improved. Enhanced.

230
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,909
- Sounds cool.
- Yeah.

231
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,110
Yeah.

232
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:56,416
- Where you going?
- Oh, I'm gonna go back to sleep.

233
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:59,452
Or maybe I'm just gonna wake up.

234
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,792
So, what are
we supposed to do now?

235
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:06,393
I think we just let him recover.

236
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:09,030
Jimmy, will you walk him
to his room, please?

237
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:17,905
- Wow, they spared every expense.
- When you're done with your nap,

238
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,208
we'll be downstairs
doing our jobs.

239
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,643
Yeah, I don't even know
what my job is.

240
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:25,478
You'll find out.
When you're ready,

241
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:27,248
I'll tell you everything.

242
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,815
<i>No!</i>

243
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,386
You're up late.

244
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,321
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

245
00:26:31,392 --> 00:26:33,060
You know,
if I was dead yesterday,

246
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,229
I wouldn't be able
to sleep either.

247
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:39,233
Nah, I had a nightmare.
Which doesn't make any sense.

248
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:42,336
How can you have a nightmare
if you have no memories?

249
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,238
Trust me.

250
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:50,478
Soon, you'll remember enough to
wish you could forget it again.

251
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:57,718
That was pretty amazing
in there.

252
00:26:57,852 --> 00:26:59,987
A kata underwater.

253
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:01,489
You know...

254
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:06,494
we're all damaged goods here.

255
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,496
But this is who I am now.

256
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,331
I've embraced it.

257
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:15,369
Hey, there's something
I want you to have.

258
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,676
I carry it with me all the time.

259
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,478
First time I served
on that ship,

260
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,013
I was the only woman there.

261
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:28,550
Master chief knew
that I had nobody...

262
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:33,020
so he wanted to make a point
that I belong.

263
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:44,131
I'm sure
there's someone out there

264
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:45,766
who cares about you
a great deal.

265
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,768
You just don't know it yet.

266
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:51,705
I hope so.

267
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:54,675
You look like
you could use a drink.

268
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,648
I already know what I like,
so I guess it's time for you

269
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,315
to find out what you like.

270
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:02,883
Okay, go easy on me.

271
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:11,025
To new beginnings.

272
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:24,506
- I feel like I've been...
- <i>Ray.</i>

273
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,008
Ray. Ray. Ray.

274
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:31,045
- Are you okay?
- <i>Ray.</i>

275
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:33,414
Hey.

276
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,385
Gina.

277
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,088
Name's Martin Axe.

278
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:44,124
- She has nothing to do with this.
- Who?

279
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:47,061
If I knew, I would tell you!

280
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:48,663
Look at me.

281
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:56,403
I will find you!

282
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:58,839
I need medical in here now!
Listen to me.

283
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,874
<i>Kill me now!</i>

284
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:05,412
Kill me! Because you won't get
a second chance!

285
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,349
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

286
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:11,620
Hey. It's okay.

287
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,454
- I'm sorry.
- Listen.

288
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:15,356
Whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

289
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,024
You don't understand, KT.

290
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:24,798
I know why I'm alone.

291
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:41,448
Where are you going?

292
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,458
Where are you go...?
Can he hear me?

293
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:53,728
Is the channel open?

294
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,764
Eric, open a channel.

295
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,666
And we're live.

296
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:59,466
<i>Where are you going?</i>

297
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:03,304
Doc, how are you talking to me?

298
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:06,340
You have a billion wireless
microprocessors in your brain.

299
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,342
I need you
to come back here right now.

300
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:10,512
I've got unfinished business.

301
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,915
What are you waiting for?
Go and get him.

302
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:17,918
We're your only business.
We are the only people you know.

303
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:21,155
<i>That's what you told me.
But I had a wife.</i>

304
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:22,724
And he took her from me.

305
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:26,226
What are you talking about?
Who did?

306
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,195
Martin Axe.

307
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:39,039
Eric, get me a terminal window.

308
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,147
His nanites are scanning
the global search platforms.

309
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:54,855
Wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

310
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,957
You used my tech and scraped
a criminal database.

311
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,326
That is beyond illegal.
I need you to come back now.

312
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,362
<i>This isn't about what you need.</i>

313
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,330
I'm sending Tibbs and Dalton
after you.

314
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:05,032
They won't stop me.

315
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:06,867
<i>This is not a-a-a hit job.</i>

316
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,902
<i>It's...
It's a salvage operation,</i>

317
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:11,972
and you are
a multibillion-dollar prototype.

318
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:14,743
You're my
multibillion-dollar prototype.

319
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,579
- I can't just have you...
- <i>Doc! I'm not yours.</i>

320
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:19,880
<i>Besides, I always come home.</i>

321
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,015
<i>You always come home? What?</i>

322
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,686
Look, we don't know
what you're capable of.

323
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,954
We don't even know
what you can take yet.

324
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:33,227
Time for a live-fire test.

325
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,362
Hold on. Hold on.
Let's just take a minute.

326
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:37,297
Think about this.
You don't have money.

327
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:39,634
- You don't have a passport.
- Flying private.

328
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:44,773
One second. He's...

329
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,940
- I got him at the hangar.
- The Gulfstream?

330
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:50,110
No, no, no. I mean,
do you even know how to fly?

331
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:52,814
I'll find a way.

332
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:55,282
You'll find a way?
What does that...?

333
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:22,242
<i>All clear. Time to move.</i>

334
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:24,378
<i>All right. Radio it in.</i>

335
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:25,613
<i>Let's go.</i>

336
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:27,314
<i>ETA 20 minutes.</i>

337
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,368
So how is he tracking him?

338
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:50,605
Well, it appears
he cross-referenced

339
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:53,140
every available
auto manufacturing database

340
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:57,010
with live GPS data to identify
all the cars in the area.

341
00:32:57,144 --> 00:33:01,315
And then he pinged them
one at a time, all 9000 of them.

342
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:02,650
Why?

343
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:05,753
To find the five moving
in a convoy.

344
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:47,695
- What the hell's going on?
- Team One, check ahead.

345
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:29,169
Was that on purpose?

346
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:31,539
- It's blocked.
- Really?

347
00:34:31,673 --> 00:34:33,273
Guys, was that on purpose?

348
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:37,045
Team Two, take a look.
See if we can push through.

349
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:42,784
Flour.

350
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:10,310
Team One's down.

351
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,913
What about the truck driver?

352
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,615
Driver is...

353
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,250
- He's gone.
- Dead?

354
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:19,087
No, gone. He's not here.

355
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,294
Oh, that's not good.

356
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:45,813
He's down, boss.

357
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:57,190
- Thermite. Engine's gone.
- This is not good.

358
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:59,326
All teams, full sweep.
Eyes on everything.

359
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:02,063
- See if there are more out there.
- We gotta get out of here.

360
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:04,132
Sit down. My men will handle it.

361
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,440
No, no, no, guys.
You're not listening!

362
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:14,942
I need to get
out of this car now!

363
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:17,812
First, we sweep,
then we switch cars!

364
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:33,561
Let's take their car.

365
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:36,396
Oh, man.

366
00:36:57,985 --> 00:36:58,886
Oh!

367
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,401
Wait, what's that?

368
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:26,714
Oh, man, it is him.

369
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:29,282
Shit. Come on, come on, come on.

370
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:31,886
- <i>What?</i>
- He's here!

371
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,354
They finished it,
and he's right bloody here!

372
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:37,091
<i>We all knew he wasn't
gonna let us walk away.</i>

373
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:47,068
<i>Just let the professionals
we hired handle it.</i>

374
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:50,004
Oh, sure. Small problem there.
Your guys suck!

375
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,614
<i>Check on Wigans. See
where he is with that thing.</i>

376
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:01,149
<i>Find out how much longer.</i>

377
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,817
No, no, no.
Don't hang up. Don't...

378
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,952
Oh, I'm screwed!

379
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:13,895
- You see him?
- He's in the trailer.

380
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:15,295
Fire!

381
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:26,974
Cease fire!

382
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,598
Bugger me.

383
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,903
Shh, shh. Listen.

384
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:07,474
- He can't get in, can he?
- Not a chance.

385
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,243
Shit.

386
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,111
Don't, please.

387
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:19,814
Whatever Harting told you,
it's not true.

388
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:23,084
No, wait. Don't.
You don't understand.

389
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:25,453
He's lying to you.
I can help you.

390
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,088
You're making a mistake.

391
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:30,024
- Thanks for the advice.
- No!

392
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,309
It's about time.

393
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:55,750
Jesus.

394
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:58,919
Look what they did to him.

395
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:05,393
Gotta hand it to him.
The guy does damage.

396
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:16,604
Are you okay?
How you feeling?

397
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:22,576
I just saw the man
who murdered my wife.

398
00:42:23,978 --> 00:42:26,480
Looked him dead in the eyes

399
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:28,482
and killed him.

400
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,057
It won't change a thing
because, no matter what,

401
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,893
my wife isn't coming back.

402
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,929
Makes you wonder
if it's all worth it.

403
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:43,697
Yeah, well, I'm done.

404
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:45,699
Yeah, I'm done too.

405
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:52,873
- What does that mean?
- She means we're all tired, bub.

406
00:42:53,007 --> 00:42:55,109
Gotta get you back to RST,
get you plugged in.

407
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,944
Let's go.

408
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:03,050
No one needed
to come collect me.

409
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:05,386
I told Harting I'd come back.

410
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,489
He sent us to make sure
you get back in one piece.

411
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,157
Looks like we were almost late.

412
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,945
What are you doing here, Dal...?

413
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:37,084
That's right.

414
00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:39,153
You can't talk.

415
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:41,556
Truth is...

416
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:47,128
you aren't at the wheel
of your own body.

417
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,765
We just shoved you aside
to watch

418
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:54,869
as we shut down
your motor functions.

419
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,638
Look at you.

420
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,109
So angry.

421
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:04,178
So driven.

422
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:09,551
You think you're the good guy?

423
00:44:09,683 --> 00:44:11,218
That's a goddamn joke.

424
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,559
You're an exhausting shit bird

425
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:20,327
with a revenge button
we keep pushing.

426
00:44:21,462 --> 00:44:25,766
Much as I hate babysitting you,

427
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,935
cleaning up after you,

428
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:30,838
this little moment...

429
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:34,975
this small part right here,
makes it all worthwhile.

430
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:43,050
Gina.

431
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:47,354
Sweet Gina.

432
00:44:50,592 --> 00:44:53,662
You really believe she's dead.

433
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:58,567
Every goddamn time.

434
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,835
There it is.

435
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:04,171
That look.

436
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,076
The dumbass catches on too late.

437
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,079
Well, I may be an asshole,
but you're the toy soldier.

438
00:45:12,213 --> 00:45:15,517
We wind you up,
point you at the next victim,

439
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,553
put you back in here
and then push this button.

440
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:25,826
Ready to forget?

441
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,434
Told you
I'd tell you everything.

442
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:57,484
<i>Drop your gun.</i>

443
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:37,491
<i>Delta Two. Sitrep.</i>

444
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:40,027
<i>Contact. Building two.</i>

445
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,163
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

446
00:47:51,305 --> 00:47:54,709
<i>Ain't looking good, LT.
LT. Hostages down.</i>

447
00:47:54,843 --> 00:47:58,479
<i>Delta Two. Sitrep.
Delta Two. Sitrep. Go for comms.</i>

448
00:47:58,613 --> 00:48:00,013
And initiate sequence.

449
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:04,451
<i>Go for comms, Delta Two.
Sitrep.</i>

450
00:48:04,586 --> 00:48:06,554
<i>Four hostages down.</i>

451
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:15,195
<i>Contact, building
two, ground floor.</i>

452
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,930
"I'm done too"? I'm not sure

453
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:18,932
what you're trying
to accomplish.

454
00:48:21,435 --> 00:48:25,072
Why does it matter if you're
gonna wipe his memory again?

455
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:27,876
It's not him I'm worried about.
It's you.

456
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:30,444
Everything we do here
specifically serves a purpose.

457
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:32,446
The training, the alcohol,
the nightmare.

458
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,783
- I know the script.
- Well, would you stick to it?

459
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:36,417
You know that we're compromised.

460
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:38,952
It doesn't work
if we don't check every box.

461
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:42,423
What you're doing to him
is not fair and you know it.

462
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:44,692
If you don't like it,
you're welcome to leave.

463
00:48:44,826 --> 00:48:46,960
Bullshit.
Just like your partners

464
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:50,197
when they had a problem with it?
Like Baris?

465
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:55,637
You know the moment
I walk out that door...

466
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,706
- I can't breathe.
- That's the deal you agreed to.

467
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,443
- That's the choice that you made.
- Well, he deserves to make his.

468
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,980
What he deserves
is a military funeral.

469
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:08,750
I'm sure
that's what he's gonna get.

470
00:49:08,883 --> 00:49:11,485
Jesus. You're just gonna
get rid of him?

471
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:15,489
He's a soldier.
You can't do that.

472
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:16,990
He's a dead soldier.

473
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:18,325
He's a dead soldier.

474
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:21,863
America makes new ones
every day.

475
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:25,966
Listen, I will let you in
on a little secret.

476
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,368
This is our last one, okay?

477
00:49:28,503 --> 00:49:29,871
And then we go to market

478
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:32,039
with a technology
that will redefine warfare

479
00:49:32,172 --> 00:49:34,174
for the highest bidder
and then we're done.

480
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,143
You're still gonna kill
innocent people.

481
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,615
The only thing more important

482
00:49:40,748 --> 00:49:42,817
than the weapon
that I have created

483
00:49:42,951 --> 00:49:44,919
is being the only one
who knows how.

484
00:49:45,052 --> 00:49:46,086
Do you understand?

485
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:50,725
Now, this is the point
in the script

486
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:53,761
where you reset
his bunk room, please.

487
00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:06,641
Can you bring that up?

488
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:11,044
Thanks for the advice.

489
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,478
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

490
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:47,682
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

491
00:50:49,017 --> 00:50:51,019
Goodbye, old friend.

492
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:21,649
I love this part.

493
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:28,255
Look at him.

494
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:32,994
Enjoy it while it lasts.

495
00:51:36,129 --> 00:51:38,766
He's almost done. KT's up next.

496
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:45,773
How'd you find Baris?

497
00:51:45,907 --> 00:51:48,442
Oh, Axe called his cell
while the big guy was...

498
00:51:48,576 --> 00:51:51,613
- doing what he does.
- Really?

499
00:51:51,746 --> 00:51:53,648
What story should I try next?

500
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:55,950
Should I stick
with tennis or...?

501
00:51:56,084 --> 00:51:57,652
Or cricket, maybe.

502
00:51:57,785 --> 00:52:00,555
I'm from Jersey, but if you're
asking, I got script ideas.

503
00:52:00,688 --> 00:52:01,990
- I'll pass.
- Seriously?

504
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:04,257
You've already ripped off
every movie cliché.

505
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:06,728
I think "Psycho Killer"
and a dancing lunatic

506
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:08,663
in a slaughterhouse is plenty.

507
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:11,198
No more ideas from you.

508
00:52:16,004 --> 00:52:18,271
Remember what we talked about.

509
00:52:22,977 --> 00:52:24,344
Hey, KT.

510
00:52:25,513 --> 00:52:27,782
What'd you guys talk about?

511
00:52:27,915 --> 00:52:29,851
It's none
of your business, Eric.

512
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:32,687
- Everybody knows.
- Know what else everyone knows?

513
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,454
Six inches is not a lot.

514
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:40,662
Wait, it... That's not...?
That's not...? That's not a lot?

515
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:50,705
We call them nanites.

516
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:56,309
- Those are in my blood?
- No. They are your blood.

517
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,429
Hey, uh, so...

518
00:53:49,564 --> 00:53:50,932
do you think I could get

519
00:53:51,065 --> 00:53:55,503
some kind of RST tech
installed on my body?

520
00:53:55,636 --> 00:53:58,873
Why? Is there a particular part
that needs augmentation?

521
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:00,373
Hey, Eric.

522
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:06,514
No, never mind.

523
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,017
Okay.

524
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:11,719
Let's go.

525
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:29,336
Ready?

526
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:30,805
- Ops ready.
- Comms ready.

527
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:32,807
Nanite systems ready.

528
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:36,644
Where are you going?

529
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:40,181
Doc, how are you talking to me?

530
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:43,117
Oh, my God, this guy.

531
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:47,420
You have millions of wireless
microprocessors in your brain.

532
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:51,058
- We need you to come back now.
- <i>I've got unfinished business.</i>

533
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:52,994
Such a relentless dick.

534
00:54:57,064 --> 00:55:00,735
It's because he's relentless,
he would literally die for her.

535
00:55:00,868 --> 00:55:03,004
I don't imagine you've ever
cared for anybody that much.

536
00:55:04,872 --> 00:55:06,607
Burn.

537
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:09,309
Would you please...?
Don't you have somewhere to be?

538
00:55:17,185 --> 00:55:18,719
We are your only business.

539
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:22,190
- We're the only people you know.
- <i>That's what you told me.</i>

540
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:25,793
<i>But I had a wife.
And he took her from me.</i>

541
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:28,963
What are you talking about?
Who did?

542
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:30,631
<i>Nick Baris.</i>

543
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:34,702
Okay. I can see him.

544
00:55:49,817 --> 00:55:52,520
Hey, boss. Check this out.

545
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:54,789
We traced the call
to Baris here two days ago.

546
00:55:54,922 --> 00:55:56,489
He hasn't moved since.

547
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:57,758
And security?

548
00:55:57,892 --> 00:55:59,359
I hacked their camera feeds.

549
00:55:59,492 --> 00:56:01,829
The place is a fortress.
But if he finds a way in,

550
00:56:01,963 --> 00:56:04,732
the 18 men they have
ain't gonna stop him.

551
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:06,701
Well, he wanted the tech
all to himself.

552
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:08,736
Now it's coming right for him.

553
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,404
- And what's our man found?
- Exactly what we want him to.

554
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:14,308
Let me know when he's on
final approach, okay?

555
00:56:16,978 --> 00:56:18,512
<i>Pulling up satellite feed.</i>

556
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:25,553
Acquiring surveillance target.

557
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,092
He's approaching
Baris' compound.

558
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,227
See if you can clear that up.

559
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:39,533
He's at the gate now.

560
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:41,401
- American?
- Yeah.

561
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:44,605
Are you sure it's him?

562
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:47,141
- Well, yeah, he...
- Never mind. Get Wigans.

563
00:56:47,275 --> 00:56:48,910
- Tell him to bring it.
- Got it.

564
00:56:49,043 --> 00:56:50,778
<i>Private property.</i>

565
00:56:50,912 --> 00:56:52,613
<i>I'm here to see Nick Baris.</i>

566
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:54,447
<i>Nature of your business?</i>

567
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:56,183
<i>Oh, I'm here to kill him.</i>

568
00:56:56,317 --> 00:56:58,019
- <i>Oh, shit!</i>
- <i>What the...?</i>

569
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:01,856
Whoa!

570
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:03,423
Multiple ballistic impacts.

571
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:05,425
Abdominal
nanite clusters active.

572
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:09,363
Uh, why is he down?
He only took, like, four rounds.

573
00:57:09,496 --> 00:57:10,865
Look.

574
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:13,968
Hm. He's Trojan-horsing it.

575
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:15,569
Pretty clever, actually.

576
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:25,579
Why is it always
right when the food arrives?

577
00:57:25,713 --> 00:57:27,014
Baris' office. Now.

578
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:28,582
Bring the case.

579
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:40,027
Don't look at my ass.

580
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:41,128
Don't.

581
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:44,165
Time for a better view.

582
00:57:48,235 --> 00:57:50,004
Energy level's stable, and...

583
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:52,039
- Okay, there's Baris.
- Yep.

584
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:57,311
Whoa,
someone's been stress-eating.

585
00:57:57,445 --> 00:57:59,013
We've got him
in the cellar, boss.

586
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:00,281
What took you so long?

587
00:58:00,414 --> 00:58:02,149
Just chatting about life.

588
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:08,189
Oh, shit.

589
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:11,459
- What? Who is that, Eric?
- He's a techie, just like me.

590
00:58:11,592 --> 00:58:12,793
Here she is.

591
00:58:14,428 --> 00:58:16,097
Okay, it's time.

592
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,431
So he's an IT guy.

593
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:19,266
We're not IT guys, man.

594
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,168
He's the real deal.
He's a legend.

595
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:23,037
- Yeah.
- He's the first guy to figure out

596
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,872
a stable bidirectional
neural interface.

597
00:58:25,006 --> 00:58:27,308
He's so good, I used some
of his open-source code

598
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:30,544
- in this program.
- Wait, you used open-source code

599
00:58:30,678 --> 00:58:32,646
in my billion-dollar prototype?

600
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,149
- Jesus, Eric.
- He's really smart.

601
00:58:35,282 --> 00:58:37,351
If he's so smart,
what's he doing with Baris?

602
00:58:37,485 --> 00:58:40,354
And why didn't we hire him?

603
00:58:41,689 --> 00:58:43,524
We tried.

604
00:58:43,657 --> 00:58:46,060
You're absolutely sure
that's him, yeah?

605
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:48,396
Because this little beauty
only works once,

606
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:50,498
and I don't want it...
Uh-oh.

607
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:54,702
Oh, shit!

608
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:58,005
He just put a hole in his chest
with his hand. That is...

609
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:00,074
Why didn't you leave him
at the gate?

610
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:01,742
Wigans.

611
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:03,512
It's him. Do it now.

612
00:59:03,644 --> 00:59:06,380
Now? You want me to do it now?
You should've told me that

613
00:59:06,515 --> 00:59:08,249
- five minutes ago.
- Yes, now.

614
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:12,353
I'm seeing CNS trauma.

615
00:59:12,486 --> 00:59:14,388
Left lung is collapsing.

616
00:59:15,556 --> 00:59:17,391
Heart rate's at 143.

617
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,265
Look, mate,
there's a laundry list

618
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,767
of things I have to get done.

619
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:28,602
- What is that thing?
- I don't know.

620
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:31,605
Can you find out, please?

621
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:34,742
- I have to charge it, and...
- So charge it.

622
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:37,478
Rerouting nanite power.

623
00:59:40,948 --> 00:59:42,950
Look how much this means to him.

624
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:44,585
It's remarkable, isn't it?
His...

625
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:46,921
His need to get even,
to get revenge.

626
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,025
Do it. Make it work.

627
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:54,295
- Do it now. Do it!
- Okay. Okay, okay.

628
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:57,898
- What is that, Eric?
- Just give me one second.

629
00:59:59,066 --> 01:00:00,401
That. Put that on my screen.

630
01:00:02,103 --> 01:00:04,805
When it reaches 100 percent...

631
01:00:07,675 --> 01:00:09,910
Oh, that's not good.

632
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:12,613
- That button right there.
- Which one? This one?

633
01:00:12,746 --> 01:00:14,281
Not that one. That one.

634
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:15,716
- Get out!
- It's one of the two.

635
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:17,084
Take him away!

636
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:20,321
Get out!
Put him back in his box.

637
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:21,556
Bye.

638
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:24,492
Close the door
and stand outside!

639
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:26,627
Um, guys?

640
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,864
- That thing might be an EMP.
- What?

641
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:31,932
An EMP, an electromagnetic
pulse. It'll...

642
01:00:32,066 --> 01:00:34,635
I know what an EMP is. What
the hell is it doing there?

643
01:00:39,574 --> 01:00:41,876
Shit. He planned this.
Switch me on.

644
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:43,844
I need you to get out of there.

645
01:00:45,346 --> 01:00:46,981
All right, hurry up.

646
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:48,482
Come on, come on, come on.

647
01:00:49,584 --> 01:00:50,951
I need you to get out of...

648
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:57,024
We have a prob... Can he hear me?

649
01:00:57,158 --> 01:00:59,460
- He's muting you.
- How is he muting me?

650
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:04,465
Come on, come on.
Wigans, you piece of shit!

651
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,201
If that goes off,

652
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:09,303
we're screwed.
Eric, fix this, please.

653
01:01:09,436 --> 01:01:10,938
I don't know
how he's doing this.

654
01:01:11,071 --> 01:01:12,806
Something's intercepting
our signal.

655
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:22,049
You murdered my wife.

656
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:30,525
Your wife?
What are you even talking about?

657
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:33,894
They're lying to you.
You understand?

658
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:37,932
I told you I'd find you.

659
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:43,003
Okay, that solves that.

660
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,525
Shit. Okay, we've lost picture.
Who the hell pushed that button?

661
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,535
- Now we've lost his signal.
- Come on.

662
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:15,670
- Where's the signal?
- One sec.

663
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:18,339
Switching to satellite.
Uh, what?

664
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:20,542
Can you get something
on the screen, please?

665
01:02:20,675 --> 01:02:22,409
I've got nothing
on the screen, Eric.

666
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:23,777
There's no signal.

667
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:26,013
Not a light on for miles.
Eric,

668
01:02:26,146 --> 01:02:27,047
I have nothing!

669
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:34,589
<i>Husband.</i>

670
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:35,823
- Ray.
- <i>Hello?</i>

671
01:02:35,956 --> 01:02:38,459
- Hello? You still with me?
- Wake up.

672
01:02:41,563 --> 01:02:43,598
Ray. No!

673
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:46,934
Okay, perhaps
a bit more voltage, then.

674
01:02:50,037 --> 01:02:52,239
Now, believe me,
this is going to hurt you

675
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:54,808
a lot more than it's gonna...
Ah, whatever.

676
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:07,921
No, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm a friendly.

677
01:03:08,055 --> 01:03:09,591
I'm a friendly.
I'm on your side.

678
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:11,392
I'm on your side. Yeah.

679
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:13,093
Yeah. Look.

680
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:15,062
Look at me letting you go.

681
01:03:15,195 --> 01:03:17,264
Look at that. Freedom.

682
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,938
And Wigans said,
"Let there be light,"

683
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:27,642
and there was light.
Look at that.

684
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:30,911
Whoo! Still warm.

685
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:33,147
Who the hell are you?

686
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,718
Mm! Goodness gracious,
how rude of me.

687
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:38,285
The name's Wilfred Wigans.

688
01:03:38,419 --> 01:03:40,854
I know.
Bit of a superhero-type name.

689
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:43,290
Heh, heh. And I suppose
my superpower could be...

690
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:45,459
...coding.

691
01:03:45,593 --> 01:03:46,960
You work for Baris?

692
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:49,731
Oh, yeah, no.

693
01:03:49,863 --> 01:03:51,899
Listen, define "work for."

694
01:03:52,032 --> 01:03:55,402
It's more like
indentured servitude, heh.

695
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:57,572
I've been looking
for a way out of here.

696
01:03:57,706 --> 01:03:59,708
I really have.
And I tried up there.

697
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,375
There's a guy
with a gun up there.

698
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:02,910
I'm sure you killed him,
right?

699
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:06,046
You're like a knight
in shining armor. Yeah.

700
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:09,283
Except for you don't really wear
any armor, now, do you?

701
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:13,053
You sort of, like, let yourself
get shot, like, a lot.

702
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:16,390
Because that's tough to watch,
actually. It's rough stuff.

703
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:19,527
Particularly the part
where they walked up to you

704
01:04:19,661 --> 01:04:21,629
and, boom, clipped you
right in your head,

705
01:04:21,763 --> 01:04:24,699
and then your brains
just, pfft...

706
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:27,901
all over the floor.
Wicked, man. Wicked.

707
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:30,204
I feel like I died.

708
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:32,574
My apologies.
I am terribly sorry about that.

709
01:04:32,707 --> 01:04:35,075
You know, Baris wanted me
to take you out,

710
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:36,745
but I had plans of my own.

711
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:40,114
I waited until you did your...

712
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:42,883
business, which you
most certainly did.

713
01:04:43,016 --> 01:04:45,285
Now I'm done
with that bloody piece of shit

714
01:04:45,419 --> 01:04:48,021
telling me what to do
and how to do it.

715
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:52,393
<i>You all right?</i>

716
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:56,196
Thanks for the advice.

717
01:04:58,733 --> 01:04:59,868
Are you all right?

718
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,035
I saw my wife in a dream.

719
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:06,039
Well, good.

720
01:05:06,173 --> 01:05:09,042
I saw her murdered
right in front of me.

721
01:05:09,176 --> 01:05:12,246
Each time, the murderer was...

722
01:05:12,379 --> 01:05:13,882
a different person.

723
01:05:16,851 --> 01:05:18,285
Holy shit.

724
01:05:18,419 --> 01:05:20,522
So that's how they did it.

725
01:05:22,055 --> 01:05:22,956
Did what?

726
01:05:27,194 --> 01:05:28,596
Okay, okay, um...

727
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:30,931
I heard them talking.

728
01:05:31,064 --> 01:05:34,368
There have been these rumors
of a hired killer wiping out

729
01:05:34,502 --> 01:05:36,203
every defector of RST.

730
01:05:36,336 --> 01:05:38,472
Baris worked for RST?

731
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:40,642
Well, they all did.

732
01:05:40,775 --> 01:05:44,445
And no one could figure out why
each kill was like a vendetta.

733
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:47,014
You know, like it was
really, really personal.

734
01:05:47,147 --> 01:05:49,082
They filled my head
with nightmares

735
01:05:49,216 --> 01:05:51,485
and sent me
on a suicide mission.

736
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:53,153
Yeah, it certainly seems
that way.

737
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:57,157
I mean, they've been
clearly manipulating you.

738
01:05:57,291 --> 01:06:00,127
It's likely
that what you think is real...

739
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,863
sometimes ain't.

740
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,668
Harting just used me.

741
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:10,672
Just lied to my face
over and over again.

742
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:13,340
Yeah. He seems to be
remarkably convincing.

743
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:15,777
Told me my wife...

744
01:06:20,047 --> 01:06:21,315
Gina.

745
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:24,485
I never even looked for her.

746
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:28,656
But what if...?

747
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:32,459
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look,

748
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:34,662
they're not gonna
just let you walk away.

749
01:06:34,796 --> 01:06:36,965
They'll come for you.
They'll come for me too.

750
01:06:37,097 --> 01:06:40,467
- I'm looking forward to it.
- I'm not.

751
01:06:40,602 --> 01:06:42,804
Why do you think I went
biblical and brought you back?

752
01:06:42,937 --> 01:06:44,037
Think I'm running around,

753
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,340
resurrecting people
from the dead?

754
01:06:46,473 --> 01:06:47,909
If they plug you back in,

755
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:49,677
it's going to be me in your head

756
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:51,913
killing that lovely wife
of yours.

757
01:06:52,045 --> 01:06:54,381
And I've seen what you've done
to those people.

758
01:06:57,117 --> 01:06:59,486
Just gonna walk away
from me, innit?

759
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:05,827
My God, what are you...?
What are you doing?

760
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:15,235
You could figure out
how these work.

761
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:16,871
So just reverse engineer

762
01:07:17,005 --> 01:07:18,573
the work
of dozens of scientists,

763
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:21,375
billions of dollars
and a decade of genetic coding?

764
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:23,545
Well, that's your superpower.

765
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,247
I mean, yeah,
I'll be done by dinner,

766
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,851
so it's not a big deal.

767
01:07:29,984 --> 01:07:32,720
That is absolutely amazing.

768
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:34,822
You know,
I've heard the stories,

769
01:07:34,956 --> 01:07:37,859
but your entire system
is completely programmable.

770
01:07:37,992 --> 01:07:40,895
A program
they no longer control.

771
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:45,132
It's my army now.

772
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:48,101
And your job
to keep it that way.

773
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:54,042
Okay. I believe the words
you were searching for were:

774
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:55,977
"Thank you, Wigans.

775
01:07:56,109 --> 01:07:57,946
Thank you for resurrecting me
from the dead."

776
01:07:58,078 --> 01:08:00,447
Wait.
I've got something for you.

777
01:08:00,582 --> 01:08:03,751
It should be right here
in my trusty lead-lined fridge.

778
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:06,554
Oh, I am so clever.
I don't want that.

779
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:09,289
Right. Oh, here it is. Bingo.

780
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:14,596
No! No! Not that one.
That won't work.

781
01:08:14,729 --> 01:08:17,732
Trust me. Here, follow me.
And take this.

782
01:08:17,865 --> 01:08:20,200
I don't need it. The nanites
will connect me to the Web.

783
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:22,770
No, the nanites will connect you
to an RST server.

784
01:08:22,904 --> 01:08:25,073
They can track you that way,
fill your head with bullshit.

785
01:08:25,205 --> 01:08:27,075
You don't want that.
Here, take it.

786
01:08:27,207 --> 01:08:29,744
It'll connect you
directly to a satellite.

787
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:32,647
Vintage. No electronic parts.

788
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,381
Thank you, Wigans.

789
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:04,045
We've got movement.

790
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:07,949
Is it him?

791
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:09,383
I mean, it has to be.

792
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:11,151
We still have no connection?

793
01:09:11,284 --> 01:09:13,286
The network's
still not responding.

794
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,823
Okay, well, get
Tibbs and Dalton there now.

795
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,096
<i>You guys are a go.</i>

796
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:23,965
- Let's roll.
- <i>We've only got</i>

797
01:09:24,098 --> 01:09:26,299
<i>satellite tracking on him,
so reel him in fast</i>

798
01:09:26,433 --> 01:09:28,201
<i>before we lose visual.</i>

799
01:09:29,737 --> 01:09:33,808
- Now, remember, he's one of us.
- He was.

800
01:09:33,941 --> 01:09:35,208
Now he's a problem.

801
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:41,348
Relax.

802
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:44,184
Now we finally get
to use all this shit.

803
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:17,451
Ray?

804
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:20,722
Gina.

805
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:25,425
What are you doing here? Hm?

806
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,828
Hey.

807
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:28,495
Heh, you'll never believe

808
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:30,765
- what I just went through.
- Well, knowing you,

809
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:33,601
it's classified, huh? Heh.

810
01:10:33,735 --> 01:10:35,203
This has been crazy.

811
01:10:35,335 --> 01:10:37,672
I mean...

812
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:39,272
I can't even...

813
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:41,876
That doesn't matter.

814
01:10:44,746 --> 01:10:46,246
Because I'm home.

815
01:10:47,715 --> 01:10:48,616
Home?

816
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,321
Yeah.

817
01:10:55,857 --> 01:10:57,125
I came back home.

818
01:10:58,291 --> 01:11:00,293
Ray, come on.

819
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:01,996
I've moved on.

820
01:11:03,631 --> 01:11:06,433
Moved on?
What are you talking about?

821
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:08,169
We settled this.

822
01:11:08,301 --> 01:11:10,403
Ray, are you okay?

823
01:11:10,538 --> 01:11:12,439
What...? I mean, what's going on?

824
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:16,443
I came home
as I promised, didn't I?

825
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:18,311
I always come home.

826
01:11:18,445 --> 01:11:21,582
Yes, I know, but I didn't
want you to come home.

827
01:11:21,716 --> 01:11:24,051
I wanted you to stay home.

828
01:11:24,185 --> 01:11:25,720
- Remember?
- Mommy.

829
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:31,424
Daisy.

830
01:11:32,727 --> 01:11:34,262
Daisy, go back inside, darling.

831
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:44,471
Ray, I have a family now.

832
01:11:47,809 --> 01:11:51,179
When's the last time you saw me?

833
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:55,049
I don't know.
It's been a long time.

834
01:11:55,183 --> 01:11:57,118
When was it, Gina?

835
01:11:58,451 --> 01:11:59,687
Five years ago.

836
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:01,956
Five years?

837
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:05,893
- Mommy.
- One... One minute.

838
01:12:06,027 --> 01:12:08,296
- Are you okay, Ray? Can I...?
- Mommy, come and play.

839
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:10,531
One... Can I call someone?

840
01:12:10,665 --> 01:12:12,567
- Mommy!
- Ray...

841
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,969
Daisy, go and play
with your brother. Good girl.

842
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:16,904
Go find Daddy.

843
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:31,484
<i>You think someday
you could come back</i>

844
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:33,554
<i>in the same shape you left?</i>

845
01:12:35,923 --> 01:12:37,525
<i>They all end the same.</i>

846
01:12:37,658 --> 01:12:39,861
- <i>Ray.</i>
- <i>I always come home.</i>

847
01:12:39,994 --> 01:12:41,629
<i>Ray.</i>

848
01:12:59,914 --> 01:13:02,283
How's that shit
feel, old man, huh?

849
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,305
Tibbs! Get a tracker on him!

850
01:13:24,437 --> 01:13:25,472
Coming up.

851
01:13:37,752 --> 01:13:39,086
Eyes are in the sky.

852
01:13:48,162 --> 01:13:49,697
There he is.

853
01:13:51,365 --> 01:13:52,366
On my way.

854
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:11,585
Tibbs! I can't see him!

855
01:14:14,255 --> 01:14:16,624
<i>On the run, two blocks west.</i>

856
01:14:49,724 --> 01:14:52,126
- Hey, whoa, whoa, mate! Hey.
- Get back!

857
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:53,361
Hey!

858
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:05,306
- You're kidding me!
- Aah!

859
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:06,374
What the...?

860
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:20,221
<i>I've still got him.
Head south.</i>

861
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:21,489
<i>South?</i>

862
01:15:21,622 --> 01:15:23,724
- Jesus, man, right or left?
- Left.

863
01:15:24,959 --> 01:15:26,427
<i>Left again. Move, move!</i>

864
01:15:26,594 --> 01:15:28,062
<i>You'll get him at the corner.</i>

865
01:15:36,037 --> 01:15:37,304
Dalton, look out!

866
01:15:37,438 --> 01:15:38,672
Come on! Stop!

867
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:50,184
Bloody hell, mate. You okay?

868
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:53,254
I'm not sure you should be
getting up. Maybe we can...

869
01:15:56,957 --> 01:15:58,192
Shit.

870
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:15,910
Tagged him. Jackknives are in.

871
01:16:16,043 --> 01:16:17,311
Connection's reestablishing.

872
01:16:17,445 --> 01:16:21,649
You'll have signal
in three, two, one.

873
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:23,417
All right, shut him down.

874
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:28,722
Done.

875
01:16:28,856 --> 01:16:30,191
Power systems online.

876
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:32,093
Full control established.

877
01:16:32,226 --> 01:16:33,894
All right. Where are you going?

878
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:36,363
- You know where.
- No chance. I need you on Wigans.

879
01:16:36,497 --> 01:16:38,632
- Wigans?
- He clearly knows too much.

880
01:16:38,766 --> 01:16:40,868
- I need him out of the picture.
- No.

881
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:43,237
You get your hands dirty
this time.

882
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:58,786
You'll remember
that I don't need to ask you.

883
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:01,422
I do it out of respect.

884
01:17:05,092 --> 01:17:07,161
And that respect needs
to be reciprocated.

885
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:18,672
Good girl.

886
01:17:38,926 --> 01:17:41,695
<i>Wigans has
been holed up at the Monteverde.</i>

887
01:17:41,829 --> 01:17:45,166
<i>He's ordered $812
of room service</i>

888
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:48,335
<i>and has watched 17 hours</i>
<i>of something called</i> Ladies...

889
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:50,738
- Not helpful, Eric.
- <i>Sorry, yeah. Okay.</i>

890
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:53,073
<i>He's got
a six-man security detail,</i>

891
01:17:53,207 --> 01:17:55,376
<i>four in the cars
and two escorting him</i>

892
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,344
<i>out the back entrance.</i>

893
01:18:10,424 --> 01:18:12,493
Excuse me.
Do you have a lighter?

894
01:18:12,627 --> 01:18:15,129
Sir,
we should really get you in the car.

895
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:18,399
A gentleman abides.

896
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:20,301
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

897
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,243
The name's Wigans.

898
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,581
Wilfred...

899
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:36,750
Yeah.

900
01:18:39,486 --> 01:18:41,656
It's not good for you.

901
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,563
Garrison.

902
01:19:21,696 --> 01:19:23,297
Garrison.

903
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:26,934
You.

904
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,838
What is this place?

905
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:33,240
This is a neural space,

906
01:19:33,374 --> 01:19:36,076
where we can talk in private.

907
01:19:37,378 --> 01:19:39,146
Let me make this easier.

908
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,316
This is all for you.

909
01:20:18,085 --> 01:20:19,420
You used me.

910
01:20:20,555 --> 01:20:21,488
You made me kill.

911
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:22,923
I didn't make you kill, Ray.

912
01:20:23,057 --> 01:20:24,491
You've always done that.

913
01:20:24,626 --> 01:20:27,161
I just cleared the path.
I freed you to be your best.

914
01:20:27,294 --> 01:20:29,531
- My best?!
- Yes.

915
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:31,932
By making me watch them
kill my wife

916
01:20:32,066 --> 01:20:34,168
over and over and over again?

917
01:20:34,301 --> 01:20:38,606
Revenge is what makes
a man like you exceptional, Ray.

918
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,675
You know nothing
about men like me!

919
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:42,677
You sure about that?

920
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:47,314
You chose war because
you love it. That's who you are.

921
01:20:47,448 --> 01:20:49,383
You don't know what I love.

922
01:20:50,752 --> 01:20:53,454
Or why I did what I did.

923
01:20:53,588 --> 01:20:56,990
People like you break people
like me into pieces.

924
01:20:57,124 --> 01:20:58,859
And you put us
into these little boxes

925
01:20:58,992 --> 01:21:01,395
so you can understand us
and you can control us.

926
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:02,831
But you can't control us.

927
01:21:02,963 --> 01:21:04,666
People like boxes, Ray.

928
01:21:04,799 --> 01:21:06,634
They need structure.
They need guidance.

929
01:21:06,768 --> 01:21:08,636
That's just a reality.

930
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:12,039
Says the man who puts
the shadows on the wall.

931
01:21:14,274 --> 01:21:17,010
There's nothing left
for you out there.

932
01:21:17,144 --> 01:21:21,048
Nothing. In here, you get to be
the best version of yourself.

933
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:23,083
You rescue the hostage.

934
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:26,086
You get to spend the night
with a woman who loves you.

935
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,589
And you wake up in the morning

936
01:21:27,722 --> 01:21:29,858
with a new body
and a defined purpose.

937
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:31,693
What more could you ask for?

938
01:21:31,826 --> 01:21:33,728
Your best version of me!

939
01:21:33,862 --> 01:21:35,630
Not mine!

940
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:40,200
Don't you get it?

941
01:21:41,703 --> 01:21:44,271
Life is about
not knowing what's coming.

942
01:21:44,405 --> 01:21:47,040
What, like when
it's taken away from you?

943
01:21:47,174 --> 01:21:49,577
Not knowing when it's gonna be
taken away from you,

944
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:51,278
is that what you mean, Ray?

945
01:21:54,348 --> 01:21:56,483
You did this to me.

946
01:21:56,618 --> 01:21:59,086
You made me.

947
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:01,723
But you can't
control me forever.

948
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,826
I will find you,
and I will end...

949
01:22:06,694 --> 01:22:07,595
No, you won't.

950
01:22:24,445 --> 01:22:26,648
Just in time to say goodbye.

951
01:22:30,919 --> 01:22:32,486
He's back?

952
01:22:33,588 --> 01:22:35,155
For the time being.

953
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:37,224
Harting's pulling the nanites?

954
01:22:40,294 --> 01:22:42,129
On the table now.

955
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:57,444
Show's about to start.

956
01:23:08,288 --> 01:23:09,256
Wigans got away.

957
01:23:09,389 --> 01:23:11,593
- What?
- He knew I was coming.

958
01:23:11,726 --> 01:23:14,596
Eric was sloppy
tracking him down.

959
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,800
Okay, stop the extraction.

960
01:23:18,933 --> 01:23:22,504
Prep the sim. Rebuild
the target package for Wigans.

961
01:23:29,042 --> 01:23:31,011
- One more run.
- Again?

962
01:23:32,547 --> 01:23:34,381
Yes, again.

963
01:23:34,516 --> 01:23:36,651
I wouldn't have
to send him after Wigans

964
01:23:36,784 --> 01:23:38,385
if you had done your job.

965
01:23:45,527 --> 01:23:47,094
Do it quickly.

966
01:23:54,669 --> 01:23:57,404
Okay, start the sequence.
We'll alter it real-time.

967
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:05,947
<i>No sign
of alpha target. Moving location.</i>

968
01:24:27,635 --> 01:24:30,203
Okay. That should do it.

969
01:24:30,337 --> 01:24:31,873
It's not my best work, but...

970
01:24:32,006 --> 01:24:33,875
Is it ever?

971
01:24:42,584 --> 01:24:43,518
Ray?

972
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:48,590
He's peaking way too early.
Why is that?

973
01:24:48,723 --> 01:24:52,192
Whoa, whoa, whoa. His vitals
are all over the place.

974
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:55,262
Pull... Pull that up.

975
01:24:55,395 --> 01:24:57,765
Why is this happening?

976
01:24:57,899 --> 01:24:59,466
Someone's altering the sim.

977
01:24:59,601 --> 01:25:01,736
Well, who is altering it?!

978
01:25:04,939 --> 01:25:07,207
KT.

979
01:25:07,341 --> 01:25:09,242
Call Tibbs and Dalton
to command.

980
01:25:09,376 --> 01:25:10,979
Armed. And fix that sim!

981
01:25:16,249 --> 01:25:18,620
All right, I got this,
I got this. Come on.

982
01:25:21,089 --> 01:25:22,489
I know you.

983
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:25,026
KT.

984
01:25:26,794 --> 01:25:28,663
KT, open the door.

985
01:25:28,796 --> 01:25:32,533
KT, what are you doing here?

986
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:35,268
What I should have done
a long time ago.

987
01:25:45,278 --> 01:25:48,315
I'm in. I'm in.

988
01:25:49,684 --> 01:25:51,786
Son of a virgin.

989
01:25:53,253 --> 01:25:54,522
Okay.

990
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:05,667
Heh, you thought you could lock
old Wigans out of his own code?

991
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:17,912
- Wait. Wait, what?
- What the hell is happening?

992
01:26:18,046 --> 01:26:19,013
No, no, no.

993
01:26:20,982 --> 01:26:23,417
How...? How is she doing this?

994
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:28,321
What? Ha!

995
01:26:28,455 --> 01:26:30,390
- I said, drop your gun!
- You got this.

996
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,564
Okay, my son, if you're gonna
come for the king,

997
01:26:36,698 --> 01:26:39,801
you'd best not miss.

998
01:26:39,934 --> 01:26:41,903
KT! Open this goddamn door!

999
01:26:42,036 --> 01:26:45,006
That should do it.

1000
01:26:52,345 --> 01:26:54,582
Um, okay.

1001
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:04,324
Oh, Jesus.

1002
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:21,175
Oh, Jesus.

1003
01:27:22,342 --> 01:27:23,443
Twenty quid he just said,

1004
01:27:23,578 --> 01:27:26,914
"Oh, Jesus." Twenty quid...

1005
01:27:27,048 --> 01:27:29,751
I need real friends!
Or a therapist.

1006
01:27:39,227 --> 01:27:40,327
Why are you doing this?

1007
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:43,064
Because he deserves the truth.

1008
01:27:43,197 --> 01:27:46,234
The truth is, nobody wants
to make real decisions anymore.

1009
01:27:50,772 --> 01:27:53,340
They just wanna
feel like they have.

1010
01:27:55,943 --> 01:27:57,745
Goodbye, KT.

1011
01:27:59,147 --> 01:28:01,481
Like I would let you
do that again.

1012
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:19,133
<i>KT's gone rogue.
Garrison is awake and offline.</i>

1013
01:28:19,267 --> 01:28:21,702
<i>Find him and shut him down.
Kill him if you have to.</i>

1014
01:29:01,676 --> 01:29:03,311
Headed to the 74th floor.

1015
01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:07,181
<i>Morning, sunshine. Remember me?</i>

1016
01:29:07,315 --> 01:29:08,649
Wigans.

1017
01:29:08,783 --> 01:29:10,350
"No, it is I,

1018
01:29:10,483 --> 01:29:12,186
King Jaffe Joffer,
ruler of Zamunda."

1019
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:13,855
Of course it's Wigans.

1020
01:29:13,988 --> 01:29:15,890
Who else would it be?
Listen, mate, uh...

1021
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:18,626
I'm sending you coordinates
to my van.

1022
01:29:18,759 --> 01:29:21,394
I realize that sounded
a lot creepier than I meant it.

1023
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:23,231
I've got unfinished business.

1024
01:29:23,363 --> 01:29:25,533
Oh, great.

1025
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:28,803
- Wait. Come again.
- <i>Wigans, where's Garrison?</i>

1026
01:29:28,936 --> 01:29:31,471
Uh, I don't know. Apparently,
doing whatever he wants.

1027
01:29:31,606 --> 01:29:35,076
<i>It's about time. Phase two.
Coming up on the server room.</i>

1028
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:37,078
Okay, there you are.

1029
01:29:38,846 --> 01:29:40,447
Which means it's time for me

1030
01:29:40,581 --> 01:29:43,017
to walk you through
a low-level data erase.

1031
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:46,520
Now, obviously, I've got about
1000 years of coding experience.

1032
01:29:46,654 --> 01:29:49,257
<i>I'm literally a genius.
You're so very welcome.</i>

1033
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:52,059
So it is vital you do exactly
what it is I tell you.

1034
01:29:52,193 --> 01:29:54,362
<i>Step one.
Find the sysop terminal.</i>

1035
01:29:54,528 --> 01:29:56,429
<i>It should be somewhere near...</i>

1036
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:42,276
Step 36.
This one is absolutely vital.

1037
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:44,477
Type control, command...

1038
01:30:48,182 --> 01:30:49,083
What the...?

1039
01:30:53,254 --> 01:30:55,222
I thought I'd do it
the old-fashioned way.

1040
01:30:55,356 --> 01:30:56,891
Oh, really?

1041
01:30:57,024 --> 01:31:00,895
It's good to know literally
no one is listening to me.

1042
01:31:01,028 --> 01:31:02,830
Why didn't I think of that?

1043
01:31:02,964 --> 01:31:05,566
Control, command,
"burn the building down."

1044
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,901
Kobe!

1045
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,527
Yeah.

1046
01:31:33,661 --> 01:31:35,663
That one was my idea.

1047
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:26,380
Right behind you. Dropping in!

1048
01:32:53,074 --> 01:32:55,076
On my way. Keep him busy!

1049
01:33:01,849 --> 01:33:03,084
Let it go, Tibbs.

1050
01:33:03,217 --> 01:33:05,419
I'll be on you in three, two...

1051
01:33:05,554 --> 01:33:07,121
Get clear!

1052
01:33:15,129 --> 01:33:17,198
Let's see him survive that.

1053
01:33:21,902 --> 01:33:25,639
Oh, goddamn it.
This guy just won't fucking die.

1054
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:40,988
Hang on, Tibbs!

1055
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:45,326
No!

1056
01:34:16,924 --> 01:34:19,059
Dalton!
What are you doing? Help me!

1057
01:34:20,494 --> 01:34:21,729
Dalton!

1058
01:34:26,433 --> 01:34:28,302
I did say hang on!

1059
01:35:27,728 --> 01:35:29,763
No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, shit.

1060
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:35,503
- Oh, that's not good.
- <i>What the hell was that?</i>

1061
01:35:35,637 --> 01:35:37,838
- It felt like a bomb went off.
- Oh, bloody hell.

1062
01:35:37,972 --> 01:35:41,108
Yeah. It's a... It's a problem.

1063
01:35:41,242 --> 01:35:44,713
Go. Go, go, go. Come on.
Start the car. We're leaving.

1064
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:47,915
Harting!

1065
01:35:51,018 --> 01:35:52,453
Goddamn it.

1066
01:35:57,925 --> 01:35:59,628
Talk to me, Wigans.
Where's Garrison?

1067
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,397
Uh, hang on. Ground floor,
east side, headed for Harting.

1068
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,801
You just don't get it, do you?

1069
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:09,436
I can rebuild all of this.

1070
01:36:12,574 --> 01:36:15,142
And I am the only one
who can rebuild you.

1071
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:18,812
You cannot survive without me.

1072
01:36:41,835 --> 01:36:43,270
Okay, fine.

1073
01:36:51,979 --> 01:36:54,081
Holy shit. Oh, no.

1074
01:36:54,214 --> 01:36:56,850
Bloody hell. Um, um, um, mate?

1075
01:36:56,984 --> 01:36:58,753
What are you doing?
You have to stop.

1076
01:37:12,966 --> 01:37:14,935
KT, he's almost down to nothing.

1077
01:37:15,069 --> 01:37:17,772
- That's impossible.
- <i>He's overclocking the nanites.</i>

1078
01:37:17,905 --> 01:37:21,643
If he doesn't stop, I won't
be able to bring him back.

1079
01:37:21,776 --> 01:37:23,177
Shit!

1080
01:37:39,627 --> 01:37:41,495
Don't make me do this.

1081
01:37:58,145 --> 01:38:00,682
I told you I'd find you.

1082
01:38:04,652 --> 01:38:07,622
Oh, man. He's done.

1083
01:38:07,756 --> 01:38:09,356
It's over, KT.

1084
01:38:12,359 --> 01:38:13,595
Yes, you did.

1085
01:38:13,728 --> 01:38:15,730
But all that's now left
is Ray Garrison.

1086
01:38:16,997 --> 01:38:18,432
And that's enough.

1087
01:38:40,454 --> 01:38:41,723
<i>How much longer, Wigans?</i>

1088
01:38:41,856 --> 01:38:43,490
<i>Don't, don't, don't rush me.</i>

1089
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:46,059
- <i>Is this going to work?</i>
- <i>It always works.</i>

1090
01:38:46,193 --> 01:38:47,829
<i>Well, it did last time.
All right,</i>

1091
01:38:47,961 --> 01:38:50,598
<i>A over B reattached.
There we go.</i>

1092
01:38:50,732 --> 01:38:52,966
<i>Should you be eating
while you're doing that?</i>

1093
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,068
<i>Yeah. There we go.</i>

1094
01:38:55,202 --> 01:38:57,070
<i>It's okay. It's okay.
We've got you.</i>

1095
01:38:58,573 --> 01:39:00,441
Are you all right?

1096
01:39:01,543 --> 01:39:02,777
Are you with me?

1097
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:07,214
Take it easy.

1098
01:39:07,347 --> 01:39:09,116
Where am I?

1099
01:39:11,218 --> 01:39:12,386
Relax.

1100
01:39:13,555 --> 01:39:16,123
Relax. Take it easy.

1101
01:39:17,559 --> 01:39:20,294
No car batteries this time.

1102
01:39:22,664 --> 01:39:25,098
It's good to see you, man.
How you feeling?

1103
01:39:35,944 --> 01:39:37,946
It's good to see you, Wigans.

1104
01:39:42,817 --> 01:39:44,786
You don't know
how glad I am to hear that.

1105
01:39:44,919 --> 01:39:47,488
I wasn't sure
you'd remember anything.

1106
01:39:47,622 --> 01:39:49,858
I thought you'd wake up
like a gorilla in a cage

1107
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:53,628
and rip me apart.
That is absolutely fantastic.

1108
01:39:53,761 --> 01:39:55,630
But what you probably
don't remember

1109
01:39:55,763 --> 01:39:57,397
is that I also made
some adjustments

1110
01:39:57,532 --> 01:39:59,466
to increase your stamina.

1111
01:39:59,601 --> 01:40:02,504
You know, your stamina?
I don't know why I done that.

1112
01:40:02,637 --> 01:40:05,507
But what I mean is, you don't
gotta keep refilling the tank.

1113
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,342
Not at all.
Get what I mean?

1114
01:40:08,475 --> 01:40:10,545
If you were a three before,
you're now an 18.

1115
01:40:10,678 --> 01:40:12,179
Heh, and I done that.

1116
01:40:12,312 --> 01:40:15,182
Well, we did.

1117
01:40:15,315 --> 01:40:16,718
We.

1118
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:19,721
We.

1119
01:40:21,823 --> 01:40:25,760
Um, he's awake,
and he remembers everything.

1120
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:27,662
Hopefully not
everything-everything.

1121
01:40:27,795 --> 01:40:31,064
You know, because if you recall,
KT, how we found him,

1122
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:33,433
his face was smooshed up
against his own...

1123
01:40:36,838 --> 01:40:38,606
Thank you, Wigans.

1124
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:39,741
Yeah.

1125
01:40:42,911 --> 01:40:44,378
You're welcome.

1126
01:40:53,688 --> 01:40:56,256
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1127
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:59,059
- It's like a dream.
- It is.

1128
01:41:09,069 --> 01:41:11,039
- Ray, I...
- Don't.

1129
01:41:11,171 --> 01:41:12,439
You don't have to.

1130
01:41:14,008 --> 01:41:16,176
Who we were, what we did?

1131
01:41:17,377 --> 01:41:19,881
That was the past.

1132
01:41:20,014 --> 01:41:23,952
You know, Harting was wrong
about a lot of it, but, uh...

1133
01:41:24,084 --> 01:41:25,620
he did get one thing right.

1134
01:41:27,755 --> 01:41:30,758
Who we were doesn't have
to define who we're gonna be.

1135
01:41:32,392 --> 01:41:34,896
We can choose. We all can.

1136
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:20,173
So where to now?

1137
01:42:20,307 --> 01:42:21,709
I have no idea.

1138
01:42:24,112 --> 01:42:25,113
Perfect.

1139
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:32,854
<i>A little too
perfect, if you ask me.</i>

1140
01:42:32,987 --> 01:42:34,822
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1141
01:42:34,956 --> 01:42:37,692
<i>Ride into the sunset? Are we
sure this ain't all a simu...?</i>

1142
01:42:39,896 --> 01:42:44,896
