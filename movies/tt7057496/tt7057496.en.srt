A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

3
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:50,132
<i>-You don't remember?
-I have no recollection of it whatsoever.</i>

4
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:53,969
<i>You don't remember at all.</i>

5
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:58,557
<i>Kill him.</i>

6
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:08,776
My gosh.

7
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:13,238
You're covered in sweat.
Are you okay, Jin-seok?

8
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:16,825
-Mom.
-Yes, Jin-seok.

9
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,953
Jin-seok, it looks like
you had a nightmare.

10
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:20,913
Dad.

11
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:23,999
I told you to go to bed early last night.

12
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,668
I said you need to be fully rested
for the early morning move.

13
00:01:27,377 --> 00:01:28,212
Yu-seok.

14
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,799
He went on about how excited he is
about moving to the new house

15
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,383
and couldn't fall asleep all night.

16
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:36,637
We're almost there.

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,472
Dad, what shall we have for lunch today?

18
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:41,642
It's our moving day,
so we must eat <i>jajangmyeon</i>.

19
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,102
Right. <i>Jajangmyeon</i>, it is.

20
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:56,365
ONE HEART MOVING COMPANY

21
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:05,541
<i>I'm seeing our new home
for the first time.</i>

22
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,001
<i>I've never seen it before,</i>

23
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,713
<i>but for some reason,
it doesn't feel unfamiliar,</i>

24
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:16,426
<i>as if I've seen this house
sometime in the past,</i>

25
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,638
<i>standing right here like this.</i>

26
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:21,223
<i>That's how I feel.</i>

27
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:23,350
What do you think? Do you like it?

28
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:29,565
I'm asking what you think of it.
Is it just like how you imagined?

29
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,574
<i>My brother was always
at the top of his class</i>

30
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:40,409
<i>since elementary school.</i>

31
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,830
<i>He's a smart guy who graduated
from the top elite university.</i>

32
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:49,877
<i>He has shown talent in every area
since he was young.</i>

33
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:54,840
<i>His competitive nature</i>

34
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,759
<i>and good reflexes made him excel
at every sport.</i>

35
00:02:58,927 --> 00:02:59,928
Hey!

36
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:02,431
<i>And he even has deft hands.</i>

37
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:05,976
<i>We rarely have to call a handyman
because he can fix most things.</i>

38
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,688
<i>-He neither drinks nor smokes.</i>
-It's fixed!

39
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:12,357
<i>He has great manners
and never says any vulgar words.</i>

40
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,068
<i>He's logical, yet fun and eloquent
at the same time.</i>

41
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:19,197
<i>Everyone admired and envied him.</i>

42
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:23,660
<i>I'm a fan of him too, of course.</i>

43
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,622
<i>No, I deeply admire him.</i>

44
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,336
<i>All the stress from studying gives me
a nervous breakdown from time to time,</i>

45
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:35,505
<i>and he's the only thing in my life
that I can brag about</i>

46
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,799
<i>and be proud of.</i>

47
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:38,717
Yu-seok.

48
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:41,303
Yes. Give it to me, Mom.

49
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,266
<i>A year ago,</i>

50
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,645
<i>he injured his left leg in a car accident,</i>

51
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,064
<i>but to me and my family,</i>

52
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,150
<i>he's still a perfect hero.</i>

53
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,404
-Watch the doorsill.
-Where should we put this?

54
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,198
Oh, this.
At the center of the living room.

55
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:03,325
-Okay.
-This way, please.

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,328
You see the pillar over there?

57
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:08,914
-Please put it by the pillar.
-Sure.

58
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,333
All right. One, two.

59
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,211
-Please be careful with it.
-Okay.

60
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,091
Where would you like this?

61
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,594
Oh, there are books in that box, right?
You can give it to me.

62
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:27,724
Okay...

63
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:42,614
-Hey, drink some water first.
-Bring some water.

64
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:46,868
Yu-seok.

65
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:49,121
I thought you were getting your own room.

66
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:51,206
Oh, I guess you haven't heard about it.

67
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:54,835
The previous owner left his stuff
in the small room upstairs.

68
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:59,506
Does that mean
we'll never be able to use that room?

69
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,049
No, I don't think so.

70
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:03,677
I heard that he practically begged Dad.

71
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,096
Dad obviously couldn't say no
because he's tenderhearted.

72
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:07,889
I'm sure he'll empty it out soon.

73
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,686
It looks like you hate the idea
of sharing a room with me.

74
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,646
Yes, I do.

75
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:17,316
I knew it. I could totally tell.

76
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,777
I was kidding. I was just curious.

77
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,529
Yu-seok.

78
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:26,366
-Yes, Mom.
-Can you come down and help me?

79
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:29,453
Oh man.

80
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:32,205
-Dumbass
-Gosh!

81
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,916
I told you not to hit my head.
It kills brain cells!

82
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:36,501
It doesn't!

83
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,842
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

84
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:45,177
Where should I put this?

85
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:49,014
-Oh, that... Just by the bed, please.
-Sure.

86
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,227
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

87
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:57,230
Oh man.

88
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,275
-Thank you.
-No worries. It's our house anyway.

89
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,323
By the way, is the guy who just went
downstairs your older brother?

90
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,158
Yes. Why do you ask?

91
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:10,827
He's your older brother?

92
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,165
I know. We don't look alike, do we?

93
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:18,126
How old is he?

94
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,586
-Why do you ask?
-Excuse me.

95
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:22,714
Someone is looking for you in the kitchen.

96
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,049
Oh, okay.

97
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:30,639
Oh god.

98
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,184
Jeez.

99
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,354
Oh, boy. I'm exhausted.

100
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,692
There you go. Jin-seok.

101
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,028
What do you think of the house?
Do you like it?

102
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:47,030
I already told you that I do, Mom.

103
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:48,824
Really? Do you really like it?

104
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:51,993
-Well...
-Goodness. He loves it,

105
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:54,037
except for having to share a room with me.

106
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,457
-Gosh, seriously.
-It won't be for long.

107
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,168
The previous owner said
that he'll get his stuff in a month.

108
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:03,004
Gosh. Don't worry, Dad.
Yu-seok was just kidding.

109
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,799
Earlier, you said yes
without even a second's hesitation.

110
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:07,843
What? When?

111
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:11,221
It will be good.
When you're stuck while studying,

112
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:13,390
you can ask Yu-seok right away.

113
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,727
Oh, Dad. What kind of things
did the previous owner leave in the room?

114
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,814
I'm not sure. They're probably just things
that he used before.

115
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:23,358
Like what? Do you have any idea?

116
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:26,236
Well, I'm saying this just in case.

117
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:28,238
You guys absolutely cannot go
into that room.

118
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:31,366
He kept telling me
not to go into the room.

119
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:36,079
Jin-seok. You're taking
your medication every day, right?

120
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,707
Yes, of course. I never forget to take it.

121
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:47,466
What was that sound?

122
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:50,510
What sound?

123
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:52,220
I just heard something from upstairs.

124
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,889
It sounded like something heavy falling.

125
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,515
Wasn't it thunder?

126
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,267
No, it wasn't.

127
00:07:58,435 --> 00:07:59,811
Isn't that where the small room is?

128
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,731
Yes, that room is right above here.

129
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,941
Wasn't it thunder though?

130
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:06,735
If it was....

131
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:11,823
-See? It must have been thunder.
-Yes.

132
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:13,825
I guess.

133
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:17,078
It's supposed to rain a lot
until tomorrow morning.

134
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,916
Thank goodness the rain didn't start
until after our move.

135
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,667
That is true.

136
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:25,795
-Gosh, that would've been so stressful.
-Totally.

137
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,701
Don't worry too much.

138
00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,079
About what?

139
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:02,499
You'll definitely pass the exam this year.

140
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,878
Don't you think
that this house gives off good vibes?

141
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:14,636
Oh god.

142
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,138
I should go to sleep now.

143
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:56,446
<i>You guys absolutely cannot go
into that room.</i>

144
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,172
-Yu-seok.
-What are you doing here?

145
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:17,133
Hey, I keep hearing strange sounds
coming from this room.

146
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,637
-Strange sounds?
-Yes, that's right.

147
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:31,189
-You hear it too, right?
-I don't hear anything.

148
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:33,650
You don't hear it?

149
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:42,409
I definitely heard it.
I really heard it a few minutes ago.

150
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:44,911
You just don't want to study, right?

151
00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:46,162
No, that's not why.

152
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:48,123
I totally heard weird sounds
a few minutes ago.

153
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:49,207
All right, I heard you.

154
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,543
You need to get some fresh air
when that happens.

155
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:54,170
What? It's pouring outside.
Where are we going?

156
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:55,839
We can take an umbrella.

157
00:11:57,632 --> 00:12:00,510
The lady next door told me that
from the top of the hill over there...

158
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,766
Look at the rain pouring down.

159
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:10,854
Yu-seok.

160
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:12,772
Yes.

161
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:15,733
Thanks.

162
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,446
For what?

163
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,739
-I just wanted to say it.
-Dude.

164
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,616
Don't be silly.

165
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,001
Hello?

166
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:35,670
Yes, Dad.

167
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,798
Yes, we just came out for a walk.

168
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:41,843
Right.

169
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:43,261
That thing?

170
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,017
Okay, I'll head back home now
to find it for you.

171
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,102
All right.

172
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,938
-Was it Dad?
-Yes.

173
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:56,983
He asked me for a document a while ago.
He wants to take a look at it now.

174
00:12:58,234 --> 00:13:00,528
I'll be right back.
Wait here for a few minutes.

175
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,781
-It's okay. I'll go with you.
-No, it won't even take ten minutes.

176
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:07,160
-Wait just a few minutes, okay?
-All right, then.

177
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:53,248
Who are you guys?

178
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,814
Get him!

179
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,032
Yu-seok!

180
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:30,034
-Take him.
-Oh my god.

181
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:33,454
Yu-seok!

182
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,921
Yu-seok!

183
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:56,603
07JO8911

184
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:58,521
It's "07JO8911."

185
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:02,191
It's "07JO8911."

186
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:10,909
Jin-seok.

187
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,286
What happened to you?

188
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:15,622
They took him. Yu-seok...

189
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,332
Yu-seok has been abducted.

190
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:19,959
-Hey, Jin-seok.
-Jin-seok!

191
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:22,337
Hey.

192
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,256
-Jin-seok, wake up. Jin-seok.
-Hey.

193
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,364
<i>Kill him.</i>

194
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:56,079
Jin-seok, are you all right?

195
00:15:58,539 --> 00:15:59,749
Mom.

196
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,543
Yes, it's me. Are you okay?

197
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:08,424
Yu-seok... What happened to Yu-seok?

198
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:11,469
He's not back yet.
We haven't heard anything from him.

199
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:12,637
Oh, no.

200
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,055
-Did you call the police?
-Yes.

201
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:17,475
Detectives will be here soon. They want
to hear about what happened from you.

202
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,691
Okay.

203
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:29,320
Do you remember any of those men's faces?

204
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:32,156
No.

205
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:36,035
It was raining. It was also dark,
and I was too flustered

206
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:38,413
to see their faces clearly.

207
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:43,126
But like I told you,
I did see the license plate number.

208
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,586
It was "07JO8911," a black van.

209
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:49,799
This is so frustrating.
That license plate number doesn't exist.

210
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,428
That can't be. I'm sure of it.
It was "07JO8911."

211
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:56,097
No black van in the country...

212
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,891
I mean, there is no vehicle
with such a license plate number.

213
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:01,936
That's impossible, Detective.
I clearly saw "07JO8911."

214
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,732
No, that number doesn't exist.
We even tried looking up similar numbers,

215
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,692
but we didn't find any black van.

216
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:14,532
If you saw it in pouring rain
when it was dark,

217
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:16,576
it's possible that you read it wrong.

218
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:22,457
We heard that you're currently
on anti-anxiety medication.

219
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:24,167
I told you that I'm sure of it.

220
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,294
I said, "07JO8911." It was a black van!

221
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:27,670
Jin-seok.

222
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:29,630
That's enough for today.

223
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:32,425
My son isn't physically well.

224
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,677
I think it was too much
for him to take in.

225
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:36,763
Okay. We'll wrap up for today, then.

226
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:39,766
<i>Then,</i>

227
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,644
<i>the torturous waiting game began.</i>

228
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:55,364
<i>One day.</i>

229
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:57,408
<i>Two days.</i>

230
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:00,995
<i>Then a week.</i>

231
00:18:03,873 --> 00:18:04,749
<i>Ten days went by.</i>

232
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,751
<i>While two weeks passed by,</i>

233
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,212
<i>the police gradually became numb
from the boredom.</i>

234
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:12,381
<i>The number they became,</i>

235
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:14,967
<i>the more anxious my parents and I grew.</i>

236
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,425
<i>Kill him.</i>

237
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:02,181
<i>And every night,
I saw that man in my dream.</i>

238
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,602
<i>He looked familiar for some reason,
but I had no idea who he was.</i>

239
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,898
<i>All I knew was the fact that he seemed
extremely agonized in my dreams.</i>

240
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:44,927
<i>In the morning</i>

241
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,432
<i>of exactly the 19th day
after Yu-seok was abducted,</i>

242
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:52,184
<i>he came back.</i>

243
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:00,109
<i>However,</i>

244
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:03,821
<i>he had no recollection
of what had happened</i>

245
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:05,573
<i>in the past 19 days.</i>

246
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:11,871
Is there anything specific you remember...

247
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:14,498
<i>The doctor said that it's caused
by dissociative amnesia.</i>

248
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,876
<i>Yu-seok</i>

249
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:18,794
<i>had completely wiped out
the painful memories</i>

250
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:21,255
<i>from that day.</i>

251
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:23,382
<i>The doctor also said</i>

252
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,472
-<i>that the only thing we can do is wait.</i>
-Was there a physical shock on the head?

253
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:37,354
Yu-seok, are you asleep?

254
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:40,900
No.

255
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:44,904
We were really worried about you.

256
00:22:47,782 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm sorry.

257
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:53,537
Don't be. I'm more sorry.

258
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:57,958
Sweet dreams.

259
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:04,090
Thanks. You too.

260
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:28,757
I made kimchi stew, so just heat it up.
Don't order <i>jajangmyeon</i>! From Mom

261
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:52,573
Jin-seok, what are you doing there?

262
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:54,241
Hey, Yu-seok.

263
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:57,912
Nothing. Did you have a good sleep?

264
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,790
I'm hungry. Let's eat something.

265
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:08,672
It's so good.

266
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:13,594
<i>Jajangmyeon</i> is the best.
What Korean doesn't love <i>jajangmyeon</i>?

267
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:23,854
Oh, hey. Where did you go last night?

268
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,857
Last night? Who?

269
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:32,947
You. You stepped out last night.

270
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:36,784
No, I didn't.

271
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:42,373
You did. I heard you leaving
and even heard the gate.

272
00:25:48,295 --> 00:25:49,713
You had a dream, didn't you?

273
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:52,800
It looked like
you were dreaming last night.

274
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:57,680
Was it a dream?

275
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:00,599
I should go. I'd better get going now.

276
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:01,642
-You're done?
-Yes.

277
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:04,561
I have to go now,
so clean this up for me, okay?

278
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:06,522
Gosh, seriously. All right.

279
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,357
-See you later.
-Have a good day.

280
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,407
Yu-seok.

281
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:18,450
Yes.

282
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:20,619
What happened to your leg?

283
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:24,748
What do you mean?

284
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:26,750
What's up with the limp in your right leg?

285
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,299
-Was that how I walked?
-Yes, just now.

286
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:42,308
Hey, I really have to get going.

287
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:44,059
Stop joking around, okay?

288
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:02,244
Which option is most suitable for B?

289
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:15,174
-Hey, have a seat.
-Hi, Dad.

290
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:18,761
Jin-seok, don't eat meat only.
You need to eat vegetables, too.

291
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:20,304
I must eat braised short ribs first.

292
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,765
-This first.
-You have to eat everything.

293
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:23,932
I'm home.

294
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:25,684
-Come join us.
-Hey, you.

295
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,896
-You haven't eaten yet, right?
-No, I haven't. I'm starving.

296
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:31,440
-Is it braised short ribs?
-Yes. It's delicious.

297
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:37,738
Jeez.

298
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:38,864
Did you have a good sleep?

299
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:40,199
I wasn't sleeping.

300
00:27:40,282 --> 00:27:42,117
-You totally were.
-No, I wasn't.

301
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:46,372
I should go to bed now.

302
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,379
Just lie down and sleep if you're sleepy.
Why are you sleeping at your desk?

303
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:54,630
Just go to bed.

304
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:57,007
I wasn't sleeping.
I was thinking about something.

305
00:27:58,717 --> 00:27:59,593
Good night.

306
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:33,705
Hello.

307
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:35,791
-Sir, please follow that taxi.
-Sorry?

308
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:38,001
-That one. Hurry up. We can't lose it.
-Okay.

309
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:54,286
Boss is here. Come out, guys.

310
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:29,947
Hello, Boss.

311
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,365
You, go inside.

312
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:33,992
You fucking morons.

313
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:37,496
You guys won't
take care of things properly?

314
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:38,914
We're sorry, Boss.

315
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:42,209
-How many places?
-Two.

316
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:46,922
Fuck. I'm already losing my mind
because things got complicated enough.

317
00:32:47,923 --> 00:32:49,591
It's possible that you read it wrong.

318
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:52,010
We didn't find any black van.

319
00:32:52,094 --> 00:32:53,178
Got it, Boss.

320
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,765
Is handling government jerks
that hard for you guys?

321
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:00,686
One more thing.

322
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:08,879
What the fuck?

323
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:12,299
Why did you have to come here
and complicate things even more?

324
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:14,843
Well, it's...

325
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:16,720
I didn't mean to.

326
00:34:17,012 --> 00:34:18,972
Jeez, are you a dimwit or what?

327
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:22,809
Our boss has been putting so much
work into you. Must you do this?

328
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,729
Well... It looks like
there is some misunderstanding here.

329
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,277
-That rat...
-Get him!

330
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:35,906
Fuck!

331
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:39,159
Hey!

332
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:41,787
Hey!

333
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,704
Stop!

334
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:44,081
Hey!

335
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:56,760
Get him!

336
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:07,020
Damn it.

337
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:37,759
-Where did he go?
-Fuck. We're screwed.

338
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:39,761
I saw him going this way.

339
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:42,889
That prick doesn't even know this area.
He won't be able to go far.

340
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,354
Hey.

341
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,981
Check if he went that way.

342
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:52,357
I'll go this way.

343
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:56,630
Hey, did you stay up all night?

344
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,426
What's wrong?

345
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,140
-What?
-Why are you so startled?

346
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:09,059
Did something happen?

347
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:12,687
No.

348
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:15,482
Nothing... Nothing happened.

349
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:18,652
Hey, Jin-seok.

350
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:31,706
Jin-seok.

351
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,834
What's going on?

352
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:37,629
Are you okay, Jin-seok?

353
00:37:38,797 --> 00:37:39,631
Jin-seok.

354
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:41,508
Hey, can you...

355
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:45,470
Jin-seok, open this for a second.

356
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:49,432
Please? Hey, open the door.

357
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:51,101
Get lost!

358
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:56,481
All right. I'll leave you alone.

359
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:59,276
But just tell me why you're being
like this all of a sudden.

360
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:01,152
Last night...

361
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,822
I followed you out.

362
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,491
You followed me? To where? Where did I go?

363
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:10,328
You know that I fell asleep
as soon as I got home.

364
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:11,621
I saw everything.

365
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,583
Tell me. Who are those guys?
They aren't detectives, right?

366
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:19,379
Who? What are you talking about?
Which detectives?

367
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:21,339
Those men who chased me last night!

368
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:29,681
Jin-seok. By any chance, are you...

369
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:33,727
-If you're having weird dreams again...
-Shut up!

370
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:36,813
Dreams?

371
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:38,440
It wasn't a dream.

372
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,275
I remember everything so vividly.

373
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:42,986
You thought I was asleep, didn't you?

374
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:46,531
I was asleep until I heard the sound
from the mechanical pencil.

375
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:49,284
What mechanical pencil?

376
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:52,037
You kept clicking it and made the lead
fall right in front of my eyes!

377
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:57,500
Where is my brother?

378
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:02,297
What have you done to Yu-seok?

379
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:06,301
Answer me!

380
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,139
-Let go!
-Put that down.

381
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:54,557
Let go!

382
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:58,228
-Just a second.
-Let go of me.

383
00:39:58,812 --> 00:40:00,688
-Wait. Calm down, please.
-Let go.

384
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:02,565
-Please...
-Let go of me, you prick!

385
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,567
-Let go, you son of a...
-Jin-seok, calm down.

386
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:06,611
Calm down, please.

387
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:08,655
-Let go of me!
-Please calm down.

388
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,407
-Let go!
-Please...

389
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:12,617
Jin-seok. Please calm down, okay?

390
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,787
-Don't you dare try to pull a trick on me!
-Jin-seok, calm down!

391
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:19,833
I'm telling you the truth.
I really didn't go anywhere last night.

392
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:21,292
Then what were the things I saw?

393
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:23,878
Who were those guys,
and what did they do to me?

394
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:25,880
Please calm down. Hear me out, okay?

395
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:28,425
Jin-seok. None of that happened, okay?

396
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,220
From the pencil to the taxi you took,
and those men that chased you.

397
00:40:32,303 --> 00:40:35,098
None of that actually happened.

398
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,436
Then what about the things
that I remember?

399
00:40:39,978 --> 00:40:42,272
I remember everything so clearly.
How will you explain that?

400
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:44,816
Jin-seok, your medication.

401
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:49,404
Did you take your medication yesterday?
Answer me.

402
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:55,702
Jin-seok, what are you doing there?

403
00:40:57,787 --> 00:40:58,997
Nothing.

404
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:07,755
You didn't take it, did you?

405
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:32,655
Yu-seok.

406
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:40,788
I'm sorry.

407
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:46,336
Mom will be home soon.
Try to get some rest.

408
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:49,672
Okay.

409
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:27,794
Hello?

410
00:42:46,771 --> 00:42:48,022
I'm on my way now, so just wait.

411
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,824
The taxi you took
and those men that chased you.

412
00:42:58,241 --> 00:43:00,743
None of that actually happened.

413
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:04,998
I've never told him about taking a taxi.

414
00:43:09,377 --> 00:43:11,713
Jin-seok, I'm back.

415
00:43:13,006 --> 00:43:13,840
Mom.

416
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,718
Yes.

417
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:19,929
What's up?

418
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,434
Well...

419
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:27,270
About Yu-seok...

420
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:31,608
Did that...

421
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:36,821
Did that really happen?

422
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:39,782
Yes. It actually happened. I'm sure of it.

423
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:42,452
I should talk to Dad about it.

424
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:44,746
No, Mom. Don't tell Dad yet.

425
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,624
-We should tell him...
-No. Listen to me, Mom.

426
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:51,002
If he steps out again tonight,

427
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:53,838
we should wake Dad up
and follow him together.

428
00:44:01,095 --> 00:44:02,096
Yu-seok...

429
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:07,310
You're saying
Yu-seok really did that, right?

430
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,482
That guy isn't Yu-seok.

431
00:46:17,231 --> 00:46:18,441
Why didn't you pick up earlier?

432
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:20,568
Get back soon. We have a big problem.

433
00:46:22,862 --> 00:46:25,156
I think that punk has figured it out.

434
00:46:29,744 --> 00:46:30,578
Yes.

435
00:46:32,747 --> 00:46:33,581
Right.

436
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:37,293
That's right.

437
00:46:40,129 --> 00:46:40,963
Yes.

438
00:46:49,013 --> 00:46:52,517
He clearly told me
that you aren't his brother.

439
00:46:54,727 --> 00:46:58,814
He also told me everything he saw
when he followed you last night.

440
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:03,486
He said that your legs were fine
and that the detectives were fake.

441
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:06,531
Then he said he woke up at home
after being chased for a while.

442
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:08,491
He clearly told me so.

443
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:12,537
Yes, I'm telling you.
He definitely told me...

444
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:19,168
Yes.

445
00:47:20,086 --> 00:47:20,920
Right.

446
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,215
Yes, I know.

447
00:47:26,884 --> 00:47:27,802
That's true.

448
00:47:31,055 --> 00:47:32,223
So, what I'm saying is...

449
00:47:40,773 --> 00:47:41,899
Is someone there?

450
00:47:44,902 --> 00:47:46,112
Is that you, Jin-seok?

451
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:54,704
Is anyone there?

452
00:48:07,258 --> 00:48:09,594
No, I definitely heard something.

453
00:48:10,761 --> 00:48:12,305
You think he might have come downstairs?

454
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:15,600
He's sound asleep upstairs right now.

455
00:48:17,184 --> 00:48:19,437
I saw it with my own two eyes
a little while ago.

456
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,897
All right. I'll check his room.

457
00:49:37,264 --> 00:49:40,851
Mr. Park, what's taking you so long?

458
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:50,778
Do you even know what's happening now?
Get back here immediately.

459
00:49:51,278 --> 00:49:52,613
Mr. Choi is on his way back too.

460
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:08,939
Are you just waking up now?

461
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,374
You're covered in sweat.

462
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:30,461
Totally covered.

463
00:51:57,071 --> 00:51:59,281
You need to hurry. Get back immediately.

464
00:52:01,367 --> 00:52:04,495
My cover has been blown, too.

465
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:47,329
Jin-seok, are you going somewhere?

466
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:51,125
Dad.

467
00:52:53,043 --> 00:52:54,670
Where are you going?

468
00:53:01,051 --> 00:53:02,678
I'm stepping out to see a friend.

469
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:05,598
I see.

470
00:53:07,558 --> 00:53:09,476
-Yes.
-Which friend?

471
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,442
Which friend are you meeting?

472
00:53:18,777 --> 00:53:20,696
You probably don't know him.
I'll be back shortly.

473
00:53:22,072 --> 00:53:23,157
Jin-seok.

474
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:27,703
You absolutely can't leave.

475
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:37,755
Let's go inside.

476
00:53:39,256 --> 00:53:40,883
Let's talk inside.

477
00:53:42,801 --> 00:53:44,762
I said we should go inside.

478
00:53:46,931 --> 00:53:47,973
Get him!

479
00:53:49,516 --> 00:53:51,143
Don't let that bastard get away!

480
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:47,866
-What's happening?
-Please help me.

481
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,744
-Help me, please!
-What's the matter with this man?

482
00:54:50,828 --> 00:54:51,662
Shit.

483
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:58,377
-Stop bullshitting.
-You said it yourself earlier.

484
00:54:58,669 --> 00:55:00,963
Guys, take turns. I'll ask some questions.
First, your name.

485
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:03,173
I'm Je-hyeong Yeon.

486
00:55:03,257 --> 00:55:04,967
Mr. Je-hyeong Yeon.

487
00:55:07,678 --> 00:55:10,639
All right. I'll try to summarize
what you told us.

488
00:55:11,265 --> 00:55:12,099
In short,

489
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:15,978
some people have been confining you
for over a month,

490
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:18,647
and you just escaped.

491
00:55:19,231 --> 00:55:20,315
Yes, that's right.

492
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:23,527
You were confined
in the two-story house over there,

493
00:55:24,611 --> 00:55:27,573
and those people have been fooling you,
pretending to be your family.

494
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:29,033
Yes, that's correct.

495
00:55:29,408 --> 00:55:32,661
In other words, you thought
that they were your family,

496
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:33,620
your birth family.

497
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:36,331
Yes. I did, but...

498
00:55:36,915 --> 00:55:38,709
-Well...
-Why did you believe them?

499
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:42,337
Just pretending to be your family
shouldn't be enough to actually fool you.

500
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:44,965
I really can't understand it, either.

501
00:55:45,215 --> 00:55:46,050
Why...

502
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:49,053
Why did I believe their lies? I can't...

503
00:55:49,136 --> 00:55:50,596
All right.

504
00:55:51,263 --> 00:55:53,557
-Did you find him in the system?
-Yes, sir.

505
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:55,184
We already confirmed his identity.

506
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:58,353
Then you should've brought it to me
right away. What were you waiting for?

507
00:55:58,437 --> 00:55:59,772
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Give it to me.

508
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:02,649
Is there anything notable?

509
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:08,197
Your social security number is
770427-1665177.

510
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:10,741
-Right?
-Yes, that's me.

511
00:56:10,908 --> 00:56:13,911
No missing person report
and no criminal record.

512
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:15,788
There isn't really anything here.

513
00:56:16,997 --> 00:56:20,209
If you were born in 1977,
that means you're 41 now.

514
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:22,753
Pardon?

515
00:56:23,587 --> 00:56:24,755
I'm 21.

516
00:56:25,964 --> 00:56:27,424
Goodness. Look.

517
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:30,552
How can you be 21 this year
when you were born in 1977?

518
00:56:31,136 --> 00:56:34,223
It's 1997, so I am 21 years old.

519
00:56:39,645 --> 00:56:40,479
Mister.

520
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:44,149
Take a good look at the calendar
over there and repeat after me.

521
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,446
This year is 2017.

522
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:00,249
Oh god.

523
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:04,169
You obviously have a problem,
a serious problem.

524
00:57:17,474 --> 00:57:20,978
Oh, hey. Turn on the TV.
The news must be on now.

525
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:22,020
Yes, sir.

526
00:57:23,397 --> 00:57:26,316
<i>The President's visit to the United States
was formally to discuss</i>

527
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,861
<i>the two countries' relationship
as well as other issues at hand,</i>

528
00:57:28,944 --> 00:57:32,030
<i>but it's said that
he received royal treatment.</i>

529
00:57:32,322 --> 00:57:35,409
<i>President Trump opened the banquet hall,
which is unprecedented,</i>

530
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:37,327
<i>and he also showed President Moon</i>

531
00:57:37,703 --> 00:57:39,913
{\an8}<i>around some of the private areas
at the White House.</i>

532
00:57:39,997 --> 00:57:42,374
{\an8}<i>Reporter Yeong-tae Jeong,
who is there now, will tell us more.</i>

533
00:57:42,749 --> 00:57:44,376
<i>The United States Armed Forces Honor Guard</i>

534
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:47,087
<i>lined up at the south entrance
of the White House.</i>

535
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:49,256
<i>Such treatment is only given
to state guests.</i>

536
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:53,886
<i>Although they hadn't discussed
what they would be wearing,</i>

537
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:56,013
<i>both presidents were clad
in navy suits and...</i>

538
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:15,259
Come out!

539
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:17,052
Let's talk.

540
01:00:44,431 --> 01:00:47,142
What... What happened here?

541
01:00:50,187 --> 01:00:51,688
Our plan failed once again.

542
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:15,295
Who are you guys?

543
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,340
That's all you want to know?

544
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:22,386
I bet there are a ton of other things
you're dying to know.

545
01:01:23,428 --> 01:01:26,473
Tell me. What have you guys done to me?

546
01:01:38,443 --> 01:01:40,445
It was 20 years ago.

547
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:44,241
On December 20, 1997,

548
01:01:45,784 --> 01:01:50,038
a family was killed in their home
located in the outskirts of Seoul.

549
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:52,874
In this very room.

550
01:01:57,337 --> 01:01:58,797
<i>You guys are working so hard.</i>

551
01:02:01,758 --> 01:02:03,385
-What happened?
-Hey.

552
01:02:04,386 --> 01:02:05,220
Jeez.

553
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:09,057
<i>It was a case where a mom and her daughter
were brutally murdered</i>

554
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:10,600
<i>with a sharp weapon in the same room.</i>

555
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:12,227
Nothing Was Stolen

556
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:14,896
{\an8}FORENSICS

557
01:02:17,232 --> 01:02:19,192
{\an8}The Police Don't Seem
Determined to Solve the Case

558
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:20,360
{\an8}The Case Remains a Mystery

559
01:02:20,444 --> 01:02:22,612
{\an8}<i>The case generated
nationwide rage and interest,</i>

560
01:02:23,238 --> 01:02:26,491
<i>and even a special investigation team
was created to tackle it.</i>

561
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:28,118
{\an8}Where Is the Killer?

562
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:30,829
<i>However, the police failed
in their attempt to catch the killer.</i>

563
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:32,330
SEARCHING FOR ANY WITNESSES

564
01:02:33,582 --> 01:02:35,584
<i>Year after year passed.</i>

565
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,880
<i>As time went by like that,</i>

566
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,758
<i>people gradually started to forget
about the case.</i>

567
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,763
<i>They completely forgot about it
after the statute of limitations expired,</i>

568
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:53,018
<i>but the victims' family could not
put it behind them.</i>

569
01:02:56,313 --> 01:02:59,274
<i>They hired people
to investigate the case again.</i>

570
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:01,193
SEONGSHIN-DONG MURDER REPORT

571
01:03:01,276 --> 01:03:03,653
<i>Month after month passed by.</i>

572
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:05,739
<i>The seasons changed too.</i>

573
01:03:06,823 --> 01:03:09,284
<i>On one spring day
after four years have passed,</i>

574
01:03:13,914 --> 01:03:15,916
<i>they finally tracked down the killer.</i>

575
01:03:17,584 --> 01:03:18,418
Why did you do that?

576
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:22,464
You didn't even know them.

577
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:25,592
I have no recollection of it whatsoever.

578
01:03:26,259 --> 01:03:27,427
You don't remember at all?

579
01:03:28,011 --> 01:03:28,887
That's right.

580
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:43,193
Kill him.

581
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:53,370
<i>So? Are you saying that I'm the killer?</i>

582
01:03:53,453 --> 01:03:54,287
<i>Yes.</i>

583
01:03:55,038 --> 01:03:55,872
You are.

584
01:03:56,248 --> 01:03:57,082
No.

585
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,543
That's impossible.

586
01:04:01,628 --> 01:04:05,048
I don't know about other things,
but I know that I never killed anyone.

587
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:08,552
You, fucking prick, kept denying it
after we caught you.

588
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:12,514
<i>We knew for a fact
that you were the killer,</i>

589
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:16,560
<i>but we thought that you seemed sincere
as we kept on observing you.</i>

590
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:19,437
<i>People get gut feelings, you know.</i>

591
01:04:20,856 --> 01:04:22,607
<i>It didn't look like you were lying.</i>

592
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,820
<i>The victims' family got extremely confused
when they found out about it.</i>

593
01:04:27,946 --> 01:04:29,823
<i>The situation was unfolding
in an absurd manner.</i>

594
01:04:30,615 --> 01:04:34,244
<i>They finally found the man
who ruined their family and their lives.</i>

595
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:38,081
<i>They were ready to get their revenge,
but he didn't remember a thing.</i>

596
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:41,167
<i>He didn't know why he did it,</i>

597
01:04:41,418 --> 01:04:43,795
<i>whether he did it alone or not,</i>

598
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:45,797
<i>or if someone had ordered him
to kill the victims.</i>

599
01:04:47,424 --> 01:04:50,635
<i>He had no memory of what happened,
so they couldn't go ahead and kill him.</i>

600
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:55,056
<i>Hence, we recruited another expert.</i>

601
01:04:55,682 --> 01:04:58,602
<i>He used to work as a forensic hypnosis
investigation expert in the police.</i>

602
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:01,062
I'm Seong-dae Park.

603
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:04,482
Let's say that this line represents
Jin-seok Song's life so far.

604
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:07,277
Let's divide it into his childhood,
teenage years,

605
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:10,822
his 20s, 30s, and 40s.

606
01:05:13,491 --> 01:05:15,035
Why can't you open it?

607
01:05:15,118 --> 01:05:16,286
I can't open it.

608
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:20,874
Around this time, he experienced
the most distressing event in his life,

609
01:05:20,957 --> 01:05:23,668
<i>and he erased all memories
associated with it from his mind.</i>

610
01:05:23,835 --> 01:05:25,211
You still need to try.

611
01:05:25,712 --> 01:05:27,964
<i>In order to bring back
the erased memories,</i>

612
01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:30,300
<i>we tried all sorts of things
including hypnotherapy,</i>

613
01:05:30,675 --> 01:05:33,178
but the psychological resistance
is way too strong.

614
01:05:33,303 --> 01:05:35,055
That's why the method is not working.

615
01:05:36,473 --> 01:05:37,891
<i>Our hunch was right.</i>

616
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:41,019
<i>You actually had no memory
of what happened.</i>

617
01:05:42,896 --> 01:05:44,648
<i>Dissociative amnesia.</i>

618
01:05:46,274 --> 01:05:48,234
<i>The memories were so traumatic</i>

619
01:05:49,486 --> 01:05:53,573
<i>that you blocked them out yourself,
you fucking bastard.</i>

620
01:05:54,157 --> 01:05:54,991
One thing we can try

621
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:58,203
is turning the clock back to right before
he got involved in the incident.

622
01:05:58,703 --> 01:06:01,539
In other words, before he experienced
the traumatic event.

623
01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:04,834
You mean, going back to the time
when that prick was happy?

624
01:06:04,918 --> 01:06:07,837
Exactly. Before May 6, 1997.

625
01:06:09,005 --> 01:06:12,342
And this is a sleep inducer
called Barbital.

626
01:06:12,676 --> 01:06:14,010
We should put him on this first.

627
01:06:14,094 --> 01:06:15,971
Mr. Choi, I'm more than honored

628
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:19,724
that you wanted to meet
with this old madam.

629
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:26,648
You told me before
that you used to pursue acting.

630
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:30,610
<i>You'll be able to understand it easily
if you think of it as of a role play.</i>

631
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:33,405
We'll hypnotize him

632
01:06:34,114 --> 01:06:36,950
and tell him
that he's traveling in a train.

633
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:40,787
He'll encounter tunnels
during the train ride.

634
01:06:41,287 --> 01:06:44,499
We'll tell him
that he'll go back a year in time

635
01:06:44,582 --> 01:06:47,919
into his past when he was happy
each time he passes through a tunnel.

636
01:06:49,045 --> 01:06:52,257
So, how will we do this?

637
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:56,511
All right.
You're entering the first tunnel now.

638
01:06:57,387 --> 01:07:01,349
And you just got out of the tunnel.

639
01:07:01,933 --> 01:07:03,393
What year are you in now?

640
01:07:07,397 --> 01:07:08,898
What year is it now?

641
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:18,199
I'll ask once again.

642
01:07:18,992 --> 01:07:20,577
What year are you in now?

643
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:34,924
It's...

644
01:07:36,134 --> 01:07:37,260
the...

645
01:07:38,428 --> 01:07:40,472
year 1997.

646
01:07:48,271 --> 01:07:50,315
How old are you now?

647
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:52,901
I'm 21.

648
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:55,070
Good.

649
01:07:55,779 --> 01:07:57,989
Where are you now?

650
01:07:59,282 --> 01:08:00,241
In the car.

651
01:08:01,117 --> 01:08:02,410
<i>Inside a car?</i>

652
01:08:03,036 --> 01:08:05,121
Whom are you with,
and where are you going?

653
01:08:07,665 --> 01:08:09,042
<i>I'm with my mom,</i>

654
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:10,877
<i>dad,</i>

655
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:13,671
<i>and brother.</i>

656
01:08:14,172 --> 01:08:16,883
<i>We're moving to our new home.</i>

657
01:08:17,467 --> 01:08:20,553
What are you doing in the car
at the moment?

658
01:08:20,887 --> 01:08:24,432
<i>I'm sleeping
with my head on my mom's shoulder.</i>

659
01:08:25,558 --> 01:08:27,519
Stay sound asleep like that for now.

660
01:08:28,061 --> 01:08:32,941
You'll wake up
when I tell you that it's time to wake up.

661
01:08:34,526 --> 01:08:35,485
Okay.

662
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:38,279
<i>And even after you wake up,</i>

663
01:08:38,363 --> 01:08:41,658
<i>you'll still be a 21-year-old</i>

664
01:08:42,575 --> 01:08:45,495
<i>living in 1997.</i>

665
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:49,624
<i>The people inside the car with you</i>

666
01:08:51,251 --> 01:08:52,210
<i>are your dad,</i>

667
01:08:53,753 --> 01:08:54,671
<i>your mom,</i>

668
01:08:55,463 --> 01:08:58,007
<i>and your brother, okay?</i>

669
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:01,803
All right.

670
01:09:02,512 --> 01:09:04,013
You'll wake up

671
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,516
on the count of three.

672
01:09:07,934 --> 01:09:09,269
One,

673
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:11,938
two,

674
01:09:13,231 --> 01:09:14,065
three.

675
01:09:18,611 --> 01:09:19,445
My gosh.

676
01:09:20,446 --> 01:09:21,823
You're covered in sweat.

677
01:09:21,906 --> 01:09:23,700
Are you okay, Jin-seok?

678
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:25,994
Mom.

679
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:27,787
Yes, Jin-seok.

680
01:09:29,581 --> 01:09:31,916
<i>I bet he thought the new home
feels familiar for some reason.</i>

681
01:09:33,293 --> 01:09:36,129
<i>I mean, the killer was standing
in front of the house</i>

682
01:09:36,212 --> 01:09:38,047
<i>where he committed murder 20 years ago.</i>

683
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:42,093
<i>It was only natural
that the house felt familiar to you.</i>

684
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:43,052
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

685
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:45,471
Is the guy who just went downstairs
your older brother?

686
01:09:45,555 --> 01:09:49,767
-We don't look alike, do we?
-How old is he?

687
01:09:51,311 --> 01:09:52,645
-Why do you ask?
-Excuse me.

688
01:09:58,234 --> 01:09:59,277
What was that sound?

689
01:10:02,655 --> 01:10:03,823
Wasn't it thunder though?

690
01:10:03,907 --> 01:10:06,075
Gosh, that would've been so stressful.

691
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:07,785
Totally.

692
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:12,081
Fuck, we're screwed.

693
01:10:20,006 --> 01:10:20,924
All right, I heard you.

694
01:10:21,007 --> 01:10:23,259
You need to get some fresh air
when that happens. Let's go.

695
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:27,138
-What? It's pouring...
<i>-There could've been a few small issues,</i>

696
01:10:27,222 --> 01:10:29,557
<i>but everything was going
according to our plan, more or less.</i>

697
01:10:32,936 --> 01:10:35,688
<i>We plan to revive the killer's memories
from that rainy night.</i>

698
01:10:36,856 --> 01:10:39,275
<i>We reconstructed the murder scene
to the last detail as well.</i>

699
01:10:42,362 --> 01:10:45,365
<i>Even the music that was playing
at the time of the murder 20 years ago</i>

700
01:10:45,448 --> 01:10:47,492
<i>was ready to be played again.</i>

701
01:10:48,826 --> 01:10:51,037
MR. PARK

702
01:10:54,123 --> 01:10:54,958
Yes, Dad.

703
01:10:56,584 --> 01:10:57,543
Was it Dad?

704
01:10:58,503 --> 01:10:59,671
Wait just a few minutes, okay?

705
01:10:59,754 --> 01:11:02,590
<i>The only thing we had left to do
was making the killer</i>

706
01:11:02,674 --> 01:11:04,509
<i>enter the exact same situation
as that night,</i>

707
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:09,639
<i>but something totally unexpected happened.</i>

708
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:11,641
We're the police.

709
01:11:12,809 --> 01:11:14,686
You're under arrest for assault and fraud.

710
01:11:14,852 --> 01:11:17,939
<i>Those fucking cops happened to
track me down right at that moment.</i>

711
01:11:18,106 --> 01:11:19,357
Yu-seok!

712
01:11:19,607 --> 01:11:20,858
<i>Me getting arrested</i>

713
01:11:20,942 --> 01:11:23,820
-They took him.
<i>-almost ruined our entire plan,</i>

714
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,364
-Yu-seok has been abducted.
<i>-but thankfully,</i>

715
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:29,492
<i>you totally got the wrong idea
about the situation.</i>

716
01:11:29,617 --> 01:11:30,994
Jin-seok, what on earth happened...

717
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:36,624
-What is going on?
-He got abducted?

718
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:37,959
Try calling Mr. Choi right away.

719
01:11:39,544 --> 01:11:40,503
What is happening?

720
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:45,258
<i>Then I finally got released after bribing
and pulling all the strings</i>

721
01:11:45,341 --> 01:11:46,634
<i>we could pull for 19 days.</i>

722
01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:50,179
<i>I was going to start reworking the plan
as soon as I got back, but...</i>

723
01:11:52,223 --> 01:11:54,267
<i>Fuck. It just wouldn't rain.</i>

724
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:56,060
TODAY
MOSTLY SUNNY

725
01:11:56,185 --> 01:11:58,313
<i>We couldn't start anything without rain.</i>

726
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:01,316
<i>During the few days
we were waiting for rain,</i>

727
01:12:01,482 --> 01:12:03,860
<i>-the hypnosis started to wear off,</i>
-One more thing.

728
01:12:03,943 --> 01:12:06,612
<i>-so you became suspicious.</i>
-That prick followed me here.

729
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:12,702
He said that your legs were fine
and that the detectives were fake.

730
01:12:12,785 --> 01:12:15,038
<i>The suspicion kept growing</i>

731
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:18,458
<i>and eventually brought us here.</i>

732
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:26,924
Do you understand now?

733
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:31,721
Why we did what we did
and why you ended up like this?

734
01:12:35,683 --> 01:12:36,517
What's the matter?

735
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:40,063
Do you think I'm lying or what?

736
01:12:40,855 --> 01:12:41,689
No.

737
01:12:43,524 --> 01:12:46,152
I'm sure all of it is true
except for one thing.

738
01:12:46,694 --> 01:12:47,528
What thing?

739
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:50,198
It wasn't me.

740
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:53,242
I never killed anyone.

741
01:12:53,326 --> 01:12:55,078
You piece of trash.

742
01:12:57,288 --> 01:12:59,082
You killed two people,

743
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:01,334
and you'll die soon too.

744
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:04,170
In the most painful way there is.
You got that?

745
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:05,922
No.

746
01:13:07,757 --> 01:13:09,967
I won't die.

747
01:13:15,556 --> 01:13:16,432
Son of a bitch!

748
01:13:23,564 --> 01:13:25,274
That fucking son of a bitch.

749
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:27,485
Turn around.

750
01:13:29,737 --> 01:13:30,947
I said, turn the car around!

751
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:38,204
Where is he? Where did that prick go?

752
01:13:44,419 --> 01:13:45,670
Faster!

753
01:13:46,462 --> 01:13:47,338
Go faster.

754
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,641
There. He's over there.

755
01:14:03,062 --> 01:14:04,730
Hey!

756
01:14:09,026 --> 01:14:09,986
Stop right there!

757
01:14:14,031 --> 01:14:15,158
What the fuck?

758
01:14:16,659 --> 01:14:18,035
Hey, move your car right now.

759
01:14:21,998 --> 01:14:23,875
Go!

760
01:14:40,057 --> 01:14:41,267
Hurry up!

761
01:14:47,356 --> 01:14:48,232
Fuck.

762
01:14:51,194 --> 01:14:52,069
Shit.

763
01:14:54,572 --> 01:14:55,406
You piece of...

764
01:16:42,597 --> 01:16:43,431
Sir!

765
01:16:45,016 --> 01:16:47,268
Are you okay? Gosh...

766
01:16:52,189 --> 01:16:54,900
This is 911, right?
There has been an accident.

767
01:16:55,735 --> 01:16:56,819
A car accident.

768
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:01,699
Yes, a man just jumped out
into the road out of nowhere. This is...

769
01:17:09,957 --> 01:17:13,961
-He's breathing now. His BP is 80 over 60.
-Epinephrine 8mcg, dopamine 10mcg!

770
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,088
Are you all right?

771
01:17:18,507 --> 01:17:19,717
Do you know where you are now?

772
01:17:38,694 --> 01:17:41,614
{\an8}MAY 1997

773
01:17:54,335 --> 01:17:55,169
Jin-seok!

774
01:17:56,629 --> 01:17:57,463
Jin-seok!

775
01:18:00,508 --> 01:18:02,385
-Yes, Yu-seok!
-The car is fixed now!

776
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:07,431
Jin-seok! We'll leave now. Hurry back!

777
01:18:08,683 --> 01:18:10,309
All right, Mom. I'm coming!

778
01:18:12,228 --> 01:18:15,189
Dad, do you remember
my childhood friend, Jin-san?

779
01:18:15,272 --> 01:18:17,274
Yes, didn't his parents own
a fried chicken place?

780
01:18:17,358 --> 01:18:19,527
-That's right.
-Yes, how is he doing?

781
01:18:19,777 --> 01:18:20,945
He's getting married soon.

782
01:18:21,028 --> 01:18:22,655
-Really? Are you serious?
-Yes.

783
01:18:26,075 --> 01:18:28,411
Jin-seok, you must be tired.

784
01:18:28,744 --> 01:18:30,037
You should lean on me.

785
01:18:31,163 --> 01:18:33,541
He and his girlfriend must have been
together for a long time.

786
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:37,002
-She's actually pregnant now.
-Seriously?

787
01:18:37,086 --> 01:18:37,920
Yes.

788
01:18:41,048 --> 01:18:42,258
Are you seeing anyone now?

789
01:18:42,425 --> 01:18:43,259
No, I'm not.

790
01:18:44,635 --> 01:18:46,095
I should focus on studying, you know.

791
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,606
{\an8}SIX MONTHS LATER

792
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:59,817
{\an8}<i>My fellow citizens,</i>

794

PRESIDENT'S SPEECH ON THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

796
01:19:07,575 --> 01:19:10,494
<i>The economic crisis that began
in the countries of Southeast Asia,</i>

797
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:16,125
<i>combined with our economy's
structural problems,</i>

798
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:18,878
<i>is deepening the urgent sense of crisis.</i>

799
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:22,006
<i>Due to the economic development</i>

800
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:24,508
<i>we achieved in the last three decades,</i>

801
01:19:25,301 --> 01:19:28,137
<i>all countries in the world envied
our stable economy...</i>

802
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:38,773
FAST CASH LOANS

803
01:19:41,192 --> 01:19:42,276
No, we can't hire you.

804
01:19:42,359 --> 01:19:43,986
Sir, please help me just this once.

805
01:19:44,695 --> 01:19:45,654
Please. I beg you.

806
01:19:48,324 --> 01:19:49,158
Fuck off.

807
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:52,411
I only have a high school diploma.
Yes, I went to a general high school.

808
01:19:52,495 --> 01:19:54,497
I'm really sorry to ask you this,
but would I be able

809
01:19:54,705 --> 01:19:58,125
to get paid for a few months up-front?

810
01:20:07,718 --> 01:20:10,012
I'm a hard-working 21-year-old guy.

811
01:20:11,722 --> 01:20:14,975
My beloved brother is very ill
at the moment.

812
01:20:19,188 --> 01:20:23,692
If you trust me and pay me up-front,
I'll be sure to repay your kindness.

813
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:36,288
Doctor.

814
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:42,962
You lost both of your parents
in that accident,

815
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:46,841
and your brother has been bedridden
for over half a year.

816
01:20:49,134 --> 01:20:52,096
I don't even know
what to say to you as his doctor.

817
01:20:54,306 --> 01:20:56,308
I'm really sorry
to have to say this to you,

818
01:20:57,726 --> 01:20:59,520
but we can't let it drag on any longer.

819
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:02,982
He must undergo surgery
as soon as possible.

820
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:06,277
That's the only way we can save his life.

821
01:21:09,196 --> 01:21:10,030
Right.

822
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:21,584
<i>Come to your senses, will you?</i>

823
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:23,752
Do you even know how scary it can be?

824
01:21:25,254 --> 01:21:28,382
The surgery itself isn't done by doctors
in illegal organ trade.

825
01:21:29,174 --> 01:21:30,843
Those who sell their organs
don't live long.

826
01:21:30,926 --> 01:21:32,344
Many die during the surgery as well.

827
01:21:33,053 --> 01:21:36,223
I understand your situation,
but just give up already.

828
01:21:36,765 --> 01:21:38,392
I mean, the country is going downhill.

829
01:21:38,475 --> 01:21:41,645
<i>You should just give up everything
and hang in there at times like this.</i>

830
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:48,444
NEW MESSAGE

831
01:21:52,865 --> 01:21:55,034
BLUE BEARD HAS INVITED YOU
TO A CHAT ROOM. ACCEPT?

832
01:21:55,117 --> 01:21:56,744
The Moonlight Man entered the chat room.

833
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:00,456
Did you really mean what you wrote
on the job seekers' board?

834
01:22:05,085 --> 01:22:07,838
{\an8}Yes, I really meant it. I'll do my best,
no matter what the job is.

835
01:22:07,922 --> 01:22:10,507
Even the part
about willingly giving your soul?

836
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:12,885
That part?

837
01:22:15,137 --> 01:22:16,764
{\an8}Why are you asking such a question?

838
01:22:17,473 --> 01:22:19,558
Why are you asking such a question?

839
01:22:19,642 --> 01:22:21,268
Because you need money,

840
01:22:21,352 --> 01:22:23,604
and I need your desperation.

841
01:22:26,523 --> 01:22:29,068
How much do you want?

842
01:22:33,447 --> 01:22:36,116
{\an8}Would you be able to tell me
a little bit about the job?

843
01:22:39,995 --> 01:22:43,123
You'll get paid for killing someone...

844
01:22:44,708 --> 01:22:47,503
You'll get paid for killing someone...

845
01:22:50,339 --> 01:22:51,840
You'll get paid for killing someone....

846
01:22:51,924 --> 01:22:54,802
I'll give you some time to think about it.
You have until noon tomorrow.

847
01:22:54,885 --> 01:22:57,638
Message me your phone number
if you decide to accept my offer.

848
01:23:02,309 --> 01:23:05,020
Don't forget. You'll lose the opportunity
after noon tomorrow.

849
01:23:05,104 --> 01:23:06,146
{\an8}Blue Beard left the room.

850
01:23:15,656 --> 01:23:17,157
Tell me now. There is no one else here.

851
01:23:17,241 --> 01:23:18,784
-Gosh, seriously. I'm also...
-So-yeong!

852
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:29,003
DO YOU WANT TO SEND THIS MESSAGE?

853
01:23:36,301 --> 01:23:38,095
DO YOU WANT TO SEND THIS MESSAGE?

854
01:23:38,178 --> 01:23:39,179
YES

855
01:23:55,487 --> 01:23:56,321
Hello?

856
01:23:57,448 --> 01:23:58,449
<i>Write down</i>

857
01:23:58,949 --> 01:24:01,660
<i>the address I'm going to give you now.</i>

858
01:24:04,455 --> 01:24:10,753
<i>It's 425-23 Seongshin-dong
Seongseo-gu, Seoul.</i>

859
01:24:17,342 --> 01:24:19,261
<i>There will be three people in the house.</i>

860
01:24:20,471 --> 01:24:22,639
<i>A woman and two kids.</i>

861
01:24:25,267 --> 01:24:27,061
<i>Do not touch the kids.</i>

862
01:24:27,895 --> 01:24:29,021
<i>Just get rid of the woman.</i>

863
01:24:30,773 --> 01:24:31,648
<i>Don't forget.</i>

864
01:24:32,816 --> 01:24:35,277
<i>Only get rid of the woman.</i>

865
01:25:25,702 --> 01:25:27,621
Oh. Is it you, honey?

866
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:31,375
Honey.

867
01:25:34,419 --> 01:25:35,254
Honey?

868
01:25:45,389 --> 01:25:48,058
Don't... Please don't scream.

869
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:49,726
I'll just leave.

870
01:25:51,812 --> 01:25:52,729
Please don't scream.

871
01:25:59,945 --> 01:26:01,155
I'm sorry.

872
01:26:01,864 --> 01:26:03,365
I must have lost my mind for a moment.

873
01:26:04,408 --> 01:26:05,409
-I'm really sorry.
-Mom.

874
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:07,035
Is Dad home?

875
01:26:13,876 --> 01:26:15,502
-No, he's...
-Don't scream.

876
01:26:16,336 --> 01:26:17,838
I told you not to scream!

877
01:26:18,964 --> 01:26:19,798
Please don't scream.

878
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,175
No!

879
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,467
Don't scream, please.

880
01:26:26,597 --> 01:26:27,431
Wait.

881
01:26:33,979 --> 01:26:35,689
Please stop screaming.

882
01:26:36,064 --> 01:26:37,274
I'll leave now.

883
01:26:39,276 --> 01:26:41,778
Stop screaming, please!

884
01:27:38,168 --> 01:27:40,921
I... I told you...

885
01:27:41,838 --> 01:27:44,174
I told you to stop screaming...

886
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:47,427
I'm sorry.

887
01:27:50,681 --> 01:27:52,683
This is why I told you to stop screaming!

888
01:27:53,225 --> 01:27:56,645
I told you! I told you to stop screaming!

889
01:27:57,145 --> 01:27:58,188
Chan-mi!

890
01:28:00,607 --> 01:28:02,234
Stop screaming!

891
01:29:27,944 --> 01:29:28,862
Mister.

892
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,583
Mister, who are you?

893
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,712
Where did my mom go?

894
01:30:00,143 --> 01:30:04,064
If you do as I say,

895
01:30:05,482 --> 01:30:09,986
I'll bring your mom and sister
home for you.

896
01:30:10,737 --> 01:30:11,571
Really?

897
01:30:14,783 --> 01:30:18,078
Go to your room and cover yourself
with a blanket.

898
01:30:19,412 --> 01:30:20,747
Then count from one to one hundred

899
01:30:21,998 --> 01:30:23,500
ten times, okay? Ten times.

900
01:30:24,084 --> 01:30:24,918
You got that, right?

901
01:30:26,336 --> 01:30:27,170
Yes.

902
01:30:39,975 --> 01:30:44,271
One, two, three,

903
01:30:45,147 --> 01:30:49,526
four, five, six...

904
01:31:00,412 --> 01:31:01,246
Hello?

905
01:31:01,872 --> 01:31:02,914
<i>Write down</i>

906
01:31:03,248 --> 01:31:06,084
the address I'm going to give you now.

907
01:31:07,335 --> 01:31:11,756
It's 425-23 Seongshin-dong
Seongseo-gu, Seoul.

908
01:31:13,049 --> 01:31:14,885
<i>There will be three people in the house.</i>

909
01:31:16,136 --> 01:31:18,096
<i>A woman and two kids.</i>

910
01:31:19,306 --> 01:31:21,224
<i>Do not touch the kids.</i>

911
01:31:22,058 --> 01:31:23,185
<i>Only get rid of the woman.</i>

912
01:31:24,102 --> 01:31:27,898
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred.

913
01:31:28,773 --> 01:31:29,774
One,

914
01:31:30,233 --> 01:31:32,944
<i>two, three,</i>

915
01:31:33,486 --> 01:31:38,116
<i>four, five, six...</i>

916
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,376
Hello?

917
01:31:49,377 --> 01:31:50,712
<i>Dad.</i>

918
01:31:51,087 --> 01:31:53,215
Seong-uk, what's wrong?

919
01:31:54,257 --> 01:31:57,010
Dad, I listened to that man

920
01:31:57,969 --> 01:32:01,348
and counted from one to one hundred
ten times,

921
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:05,393
but both Mom and Chan-mi
are collapsed and bleeding on the floor.

922
01:32:05,477 --> 01:32:06,937
What happened to Chan-mi?

923
01:32:07,646 --> 01:32:09,064
She's not breathing.

924
01:32:09,689 --> 01:32:11,483
Okay, I'll be home shortly.

925
01:32:26,248 --> 01:32:28,959
Doctor, why did you do such a thing?

926
01:32:31,336 --> 01:32:32,379
They're your family.

927
01:32:33,505 --> 01:32:35,131
The sacrifice of my wife

928
01:32:36,508 --> 01:32:38,760
could've prevented my family
from ending up on the streets.

929
01:32:41,012 --> 01:32:42,597
With the insurance payout...

930
01:32:43,932 --> 01:32:46,142
You can't do something like that
to your family, Doctor...

931
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,562
You accepted my offer
in order to save your brother's life.

932
01:32:49,646 --> 01:32:51,606
I did it for my kids.

933
01:32:53,149 --> 01:32:53,984
But...

934
01:32:54,734 --> 01:32:56,111
But you ruined everything.

935
01:32:57,946 --> 01:33:01,616
My daughter is dead now.
Your brother will die soon as well.

936
01:33:04,286 --> 01:33:07,747
So you should die too!

937
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:10,166
Wait, Doctor...

938
01:33:11,876 --> 01:33:13,128
Die.

939
01:33:17,632 --> 01:33:19,301
Why did it have to be me?

940
01:33:20,468 --> 01:33:21,386
No reason.

941
01:33:22,137 --> 01:33:23,555
Just die!

942
01:33:34,357 --> 01:33:36,359
No. Please, no.

943
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:38,737
No!

944
01:34:38,671 --> 01:34:40,757
People don't die easily, right?

945
01:34:51,309 --> 01:34:52,602
All of this must be hard for you.

946
01:34:59,651 --> 01:35:00,902
I'm exhausted, too.

947
01:35:03,738 --> 01:35:04,739
I'll end your misery.

948
01:35:21,798 --> 01:35:23,800
Where is the victims' family?

949
01:35:24,717 --> 01:35:25,552
Why do you ask?

950
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:31,349
Please make sure you tell them

951
01:35:33,435 --> 01:35:36,438
that I'm truly sorry.

952
01:35:49,284 --> 01:35:50,660
You must have regained your memory.

953
01:35:59,878 --> 01:36:00,879
Why did you do it?

954
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:04,007
Why did you kill
that woman and her daughter?

955
01:36:09,637 --> 01:36:11,055
Someone put you up to it, right?

956
01:36:17,187 --> 01:36:18,062
By any chance,

957
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:20,690
did the woman's husband hire you to do it?

958
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:27,739
I recently received
a piece of information.

959
01:36:29,699 --> 01:36:32,744
Apparently, he signed up
for a bunch of insurance policies for her

960
01:36:34,162 --> 01:36:36,414
a month before the incident took place.

961
01:36:39,751 --> 01:36:40,960
Did he put you up to it?

962
01:36:42,378 --> 01:36:43,421
For the insurance payout?

963
01:36:49,177 --> 01:36:53,348
The victims' family wants
to know the truth.

964
01:36:56,309 --> 01:36:59,229
Remember that boy
you didn't kill that night?

965
01:36:59,812 --> 01:37:00,647
That little kid.

966
01:37:03,733 --> 01:37:07,445
You should tell him the truth
and beg for forgiveness.

967
01:37:09,822 --> 01:37:11,491
You told me
that you would bring my mom home

968
01:37:11,574 --> 01:37:14,202
if I counted from one to one hundred
ten times.

969
01:37:18,164 --> 01:37:20,083
Do you know how my life changed
after that day?

970
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:23,378
My relatives took all the money

971
01:37:23,461 --> 01:37:25,004
and abandoned me at an orphanage.

972
01:37:26,881 --> 01:37:29,884
Fuck. I cried every night and told myself

973
01:37:31,261 --> 01:37:32,595
that I'll be sure to catch the man

974
01:37:35,181 --> 01:37:38,184
who killed my entire family when I grow up

975
01:37:39,852 --> 01:37:42,021
and that I'll get back at him
no matter what.

976
01:37:43,231 --> 01:37:47,485
Fuck, that night...
Why didn't you kill that kid too?

977
01:37:50,071 --> 01:37:53,032
You should've just killed that kid too,
you fucking son of a bitch!

978
01:37:56,494 --> 01:37:57,328
I'm sorry...

979
01:38:01,082 --> 01:38:01,916
Sorry.

980
01:38:03,543 --> 01:38:04,377
I'm sorry.

981
01:38:07,714 --> 01:38:08,548
I'm really sorry.

982
01:38:10,925 --> 01:38:11,759
I'm sorry...

983
01:38:13,469 --> 01:38:14,721
Fuck!

984
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:24,230
Now, tell me.

985
01:38:27,734 --> 01:38:29,569
Did her husband make you do it?

986
01:38:31,487 --> 01:38:32,322
Answer me!

987
01:38:32,989 --> 01:38:35,199
I'm asking you if my dad made you do it!

988
01:38:43,791 --> 01:38:44,626
No.

989
01:38:46,586 --> 01:38:47,754
I did it alone.

990
01:38:50,715 --> 01:38:51,633
All of it.

991
01:38:53,551 --> 01:38:54,469
It was all me.

992
01:39:01,517 --> 01:39:03,436
What the fuck?

993
01:39:06,773 --> 01:39:08,274
I knew it.

994
01:39:12,737 --> 01:39:15,365
The fact that her husband signed up
for a bunch of insurance policies

995
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:19,327
must have been just a coincidence.

996
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,204
Right? Fuck. Am I right?

997
01:39:33,716 --> 01:39:34,550
What the fuck?

998
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:40,598
Do you seriously expect me
to believe that?

999
01:40:02,036 --> 01:40:03,037
I wish you the best.

1000
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:55,673
Excuse me, sir.

1001
01:40:56,466 --> 01:40:58,509
That's a dead end.

1002
01:40:58,593 --> 01:41:00,762
You need to come this way
to get to the elevator.

1003
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:50,079
FORGOTTEN

1004
01:42:52,164 --> 01:42:53,291
<i>Jin-seok!</i>

1005
01:42:53,958 --> 01:42:55,334
<i>The car is fixed now!</i>

1006
01:42:56,043 --> 01:42:59,797
Jin-seok! We'll leave now. Hurry back!

1007
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:02,341
All right, Mom. I'm coming!

1008
01:43:10,766 --> 01:43:11,642
Hi.

1009
01:43:12,727 --> 01:43:13,728
How old are you?

1010
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:17,023
You're five?

1011
01:43:21,694 --> 01:43:23,905
It's okay. It's all yours.

1012
01:43:25,489 --> 01:43:27,867
Seong-uk! Seong-uk Choi!

1013
01:43:28,534 --> 01:43:29,785
Mom!

1014
01:43:35,791 --> 01:43:36,626
Let's go.

1015
01:43:37,335 --> 01:43:38,544
What did you talk to him about?

1016
01:43:39,837 --> 01:43:40,671
Did you have fun?

1017
01:43:41,756 --> 01:43:43,049
Shall we go to an amusement park?

1018
01:43:43,174 --> 01:43:45,468
Seong-uk, say yes. Let's go.
Come on! Give me a high five.

1019
01:43:49,972 --> 01:43:51,015
-Did that hurt?
-Let's go.

1020
01:43:51,432 --> 01:43:52,642
What ride do you want to go on?

1021
01:48:35,174 --> 01:48:37,384
