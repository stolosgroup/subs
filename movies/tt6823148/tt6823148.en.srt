2
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,510
Greetings to you, O my sister.

3
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,850
Do you want to sing a song to her?

4
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,190
<i>O, you...</i>

5
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,520
<i>...Enlightened...</i>

6
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,790
Who are you?
What are you doing?

7
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,120
We are going to the convent of Pescia,
where our daughter will take the veil.

8
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,540
They have money, Captain.

9
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,950
To pay her dowry to the convent.

10
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,460
I pay in bills of exchange,
not in Écus.

11
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,510
You must have something.

12
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,770
Give us back that chain!
It belongs to my mother.

13
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,600
She has more balls than you!

14
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,860
The Blessed Virgin will punish you.

15
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,650
What do you know about that?

16
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,980
She does whatever I ask of her.

17
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,070
Fuck her...
the Virgin.

18
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,490
Do you hear it?

19
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,040
It's the voice of the Virgin.
She shows that she's heard me.

20
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,670
Shit!

21
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,170
Take it!

22
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,710
She'll have a good time with you,
the Virgin.

23
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,380
Let's go!

24
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,400
Hello, Lord Carlini.

25
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,860
If you would like to follow me.

26
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,790
Wait here.

27
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,170
The Theatines are grateful,
for you are bringing a bride to Jesus.

28
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,510
Benedetta will be very happy with us.

29
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,550
I bring oranges, apples
and wine in large quantities.

30
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,430
For 25 years
you will receive the same.

31
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,760
Every year.

32
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,770
That is very generous of you,
Lord Carlini.

33
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,230
What about the dowry?

34
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,030
When my little Benedetta was born,
she almost died.

35
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,780
But God miraculously saved her.
So I promised to give her to him.

36
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,910
A very moving story.
I've heard a lot like that.

37
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,200
And every time, it touches me.

38
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,590
But every year, hundreds
of girls want to serve God.

39
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,300
This year's postulants ...
And I can only take three.

40
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,470
I appreciate the challenges
you face,

41
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,850
I will give you 50 gold crowns.

42
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,180
In addition to the fruit and wine,
which don't count for nothing.

43
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,560
Outside of here, a wife's dowry
is at least 150 crowns.

44
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,740
Is a bride of Christ
worth less than 100?

45
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,530
Let's cut the pear in half: 75.

46
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,700
You are not going to quibble
like a Jew for 25 crowns.

47
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,950
After all, Giulano,
she is your darling daughter.

48
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,080
Understood.

49
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,750
- 100 ecus.
- We don't trade horses.

50
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,260
Your word is enough for me.
And your bill of exchange.

51
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,020
She's too tall.

52
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,440
- They are so beautiful.
- Take off your dress!

53
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,780
- What is that?
- It was from my mother.

54
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,740
To pray to the Blessed Virgin.

55
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,200
We have our own Virgin
at the convent.

56
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,410
It is to her that you will pray.

57
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,670
- But she's mine!
- Hurry.

58
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,790
The dress now.

59
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,720
It itches, it's horrible.

60
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,800
It's on purpose.

61
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,810
Your body is your worst enemy.

62
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,560
You better
not feel too good in it.

63
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,480
When I was
a little older than you

64
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,150
I lost two inches of flesh
under a drunkard's knife.

65
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,870
This wooden finger,
I care more about than the nine others.

66
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,040
If I could, I would replace
every part of my body

67
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,750
until it is just a block of wood

68
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,670
in which
the name of God would be carved.

69
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,500
Like on a gravestone?

70
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,340
You are intelligent.

71
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,600
But it can be dangerous,
my little one.

72
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,560
And not just for others.

73
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,900
Benedetta, it's over here.

74
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,370
Give it to me.

75
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,830
Here is your cell.

76
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,170
Tomorrow you put this on.

77
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,970
Beloved Mary,

78
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,220
you are my mother now.

79
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,180
Please help me.
I feel so lonely.

80
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,230
I don't know
if you can hear me where I am.

81
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,950
Benedetta!

82
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,370
Are you hurt?

83
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,790
Raise the statue!

84
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,840
- Did you touch the statue?
- No.

85
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,010
- She fell on me.
- What were you doing there?

86
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,810
I wanted to pray to the virgin.

87
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,600
Can you stand on your legs?

88
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
Yes.

89
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,820
It is a miracle
that she wasn't crushed.

90
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,280
All right, go to bed
and bring Benedetta back to bed.

91
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,450
Well.

92
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,960
My mother!

93
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,380
Could it be
a real miracle?

94
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,590
Let's avoid big words.

95
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,380
Miracles are springing up
like mushrooms.

96
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,180
But they're not worth
the trouble they pose.

97
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,180
I didn't really believe it.

98
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,570
I have longed to see my son;
the Lord Jesus.

99
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,320
I wanted to be
in the presence of his body again.

100
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,150
And God...

101
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,490
in his infinite gentleness,

102
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,330
sent me an angel,
who proclaimed that night:

103
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,540
"You will ascend to your son
in glory."

104
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,040
For your presence here, my brothers,

105
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,880
I prayed fervently.

106
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,210
Noble lady, full of grace

107
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,590
and wisdom,

108
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,010
you are our reward.

109
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,930
I will now take my place
on this bed prepared for me.

110
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,620
Benedetta!

111
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,290
Come!

112
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,790
You are my wife.

113
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,630
Come to me!

114
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,890
I'm coming, Lord, I'm coming.

115
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,300
Come to me!

116
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,690
Benedetta, your feet!

117
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,130
This feast is offered to us
by our generous guest,

118
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,630
Giulano Carlini.

119
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,800
Let's drink to his health.

120
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,300
Let us have a thought
for our bishop of Milan

121
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,100
who passed away
last week.

122
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,140
I heard
it was the plague.

123
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,980
Indeed.

124
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
The bishop was a good man.

125
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,360
But I think his cathedra
made his head spin.

126
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,660
If it is the will of God,

127
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,660
his seat will be better occupied
by your grace.

128
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,290
Oh no.
No, and it is very sad.

129
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,750
Yet I paid court to the Vatican
with the impudence of a whore,

130
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,300
but I am not
a prominent enough character.

131
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,140
It would be amazing if the Pope could
locate Pescia on a map.

132
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,970
We just have to hope for
a cartographic miracle.

133
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,650
What were you doing with your feet?

134
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,780
You were supposed to be dead.

135
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,610
I saw Jesus.

136
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,280
He came to me.

137
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,290
I am his wife, am I not?

138
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,670
Yes. Yes of course.

139
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,630
Open the door!

140
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Open.

141
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,800
He will kill me, help me!

142
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,800
Open! Please!

143
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,390
Take me!
No, he's approaching!

144
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,940
- Please help me.
- Hooker!

145
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,820
You will not escape me.
You are mine, little whore!

146
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,280
I want to be with you!
Please!

147
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,950
Come!

148
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,160
- Are you looking for a fight?
- You are in a convent!

149
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,620
I love Jesus.

150
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,790
- Accept me.
- I'm her father.

151
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,540
- She's mine.
- Let me stay here.

152
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,010
But ... a convent is not
a place of charity, dear child.

153
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,720
You have to pay to get in here.
Do you have money?

154
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
No.

155
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,800
- That's enough now!
- No!

156
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,390
Let go of me!

157
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,100
I want to serve God!

158
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,350
Mother, help her.

159
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,610
- We will pay her dowry!
- Am I going to pay for a stranger?

160
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,190
I will pray for you all my life,
sir.

161
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,230
Magnificent!

162
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,910
Lord Carlini, the rich
do not enter the kingdom of God.

163
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,450
Jesus said so.

164
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,370
And you, reverend mother,
you are doing everything

165
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,160
to get me in.

166
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,170
OK.

167
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,380
Gift for you, Benedetta.

168
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,920
What?
My daughter is mine.

169
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,760
- I won't give her to you for nothing.
- I'll give you ten dinari.

170
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,100
Twenty. And the price of a dog
to replace that bitch.

171
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,420
Here you go.

172
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,790
This is delicious.

173
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,000
Here, catch.

174
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,300
Lather yourself well.

175
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,510
What's your name?

176
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,520
- Sister Benedetta, how about you?
- Bartolomea.

177
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,390
- Bartolomea what?
- Bartolomea period.

178
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,520
- Is it a rule to wash properly?
- A clean body for a clean soul.

179
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,820
I rub as hard as I can.

180
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,990
Damn, my soap.
Where is it?

181
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,570
I almost fell.

182
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,160
Is there water left for me to rinse off?

183
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,460
Sister Benedetta?

184
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,420
Your nightgown is on the table.

185
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,350
Sister Benedetta?

186
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,560
I need to shit.
Where is it?

187
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,900
Follow me.

188
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,320
Real toilet seats?

189
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,030
- Where did you do it before?
- Well outside, with the animals.

190
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,380
Oh, that feels good!
It's relieving!

191
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,930
Hush! We can't
talk so loud.

192
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,970
That is allowed, I hope.

193
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,560
Wait a minute.

194
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,820
Sorry, who did that to you?

195
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,660
My father.

196
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,830
Why?

197
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,500
My mother died of the plague,
so my father took me as his wife.

198
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,590
I told him I didn't want to,
but he didn't give a shit.

199
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,590
- Like a woman, for everything?
- Yes, everything.

200
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,640
My brothers also did the same
when the old man wasn't looking.

201
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,690
This morning, I tried to stab him
with scissors.

202
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,900
He didn't like it, he was going to murder me.
So I ran away.

203
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,070
It's not an advantage to be beautiful.

204
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,950
If I looked like a goat,
he would do the same.

205
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,830
Do you think I'm beautiful?

206
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,290
Don't you know that?

207
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,960
No.
We didn't have a mirror at home.

208
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,630
You are beautiful.

209
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,920
Maybe you could see your reflection
in my eyes.

210
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,600
- I don't see anything.
- You have to move closer.

211
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,600
So, do you see yourself?

212
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,610
What are you two doing there?

213
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,410
She didn't know
where the latrines were.

214
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,830
Who is she?

215
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,540
Christina.
The daughter of the Reverend Mother.

216
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,420
Does she always spy like that
for her mother?

217
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,660
Holy Mother, Bartolomea
wants me to show her the example,

218
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,240
but I am not worthy
to teach her.

219
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,450
God has placed
this young girl in your path.

220
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,710
Doesn't she need love
and advice?

221
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,090
Yes, but it must be
directed with an iron fist ...

222
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,670
that I do not have.

223
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,170
God will guide you.

224
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,410
Help!
Jesus!

225
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,010
- What did those beasts want?
- To kill you.

226
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:10,050
They are demons trying
to pull us away from each other.

227
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,050
But they are stupid.

228
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,020
Neither life nor death
can separate us.

229
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,780
Stay with me.

230
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,820
Yes, sweet Jesus.

231
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,450
I will stay with you.

232
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,330
Speak, my sister.

233
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,500
My father...

234
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,210
I saw Jesus.

235
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,840
- In a dream?
- No.

236
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,680
In the flesh.
As I see you in front of me.

237
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,100
How did you feel?

238
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,150
- Afraid.
- So that was a false view.

239
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,690
When Christ manifests himself,
we are filled with joy.

240
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,950
How do you know
what is right or wrong?

241
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,120
Through suffering.

242
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,040
It is the only way
to know Christ.

243
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,080
I know God wants
us to suffer, but ...

244
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,710
- ... that scares me.
- It's natural.

245
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,720
The ways of God
are often terrifying.

246
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,550
Fools say:

247
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,970
"I am not afraid of him,
for I know he is all goodness."

248
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,720
Have they never seen
a surgeon at work?

249
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,400
So we must rejoice
in our misfortunes?

250
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,770
Pray for it.

251
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,980
I absolve you.

252
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,760
The spools are ruined.
Do you know how much they're worth?

253
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,130
- What a fool!
- You ran into me.

254
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,390
- I beg your pardon?
- It's your fault.

255
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,010
Stop lying.

256
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,350
I saw you.

257
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,440
- Get those spools out of the cauldron.
- The water is still boiling.

258
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,650
Get them out of there and quickly,
or we'll send you back to your father.

259
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,470
And the rest?

260
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,720
- You want me to do it again?
- The spools are getting destroyed.

261
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,560
- Stop it!
- Who cares!

262
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,900
What's happening here ?

263
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,150
Bartolomea burned her hand.

264
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,200
- Everyone back to work!
- Sister Petra,

265
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,700
- she has to go to the infirmary.
- Ben, take her.

266
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,130
One of your sisters
damaged spools of silk

267
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,470
and you have taken it upon yourself
to give her punishment.

268
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,550
No, reverend mother.

269
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
No?

270
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,220
I didn't want to punish her,
but to hurt her.

271
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,190
Did you want to inflict pain
on one of your sisters on purpose?

272
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,400
Yes, deliberately.

273
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,610
Wasn't it out of malignancy?

274
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,610
If you say
it's out of malignity, it's true.

275
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,030
Don't you know
your feelings?

276
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,660
It seems not.

277
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,970
Bartolomea did something
that made you angry?

278
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,550
No.

279
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,100
- Do you hate her for a reason?
- No!

280
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,890
Do you have affection for her?

281
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,280
I have ... compassion, yes.
For all her suffering.

282
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,820
Including the
ones you inflict on her?

283
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,700
Yes, my dad says they
guide us to God

284
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,620
and make us stronger.

285
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,120
Our own suffering.

286
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,830
Not those of others.

287
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,420
You have shown too much zeal.
No bread for a week

288
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,050
and you will change
Sister Jacopa's sheets for 15 days.

289
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,470
- You may leave.
- Okay, reverend mother.

290
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,410
- My sister, I'm supposed to help you.
- Stay where you are.

291
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,000
Suffering is my job,
I'm proud of it.

292
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,790
Pride is a sin.

293
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,130
Everyone has the right to a sin.

294
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,220
Which is yours ?

295
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,260
I have never sinned.

296
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,810
But I know I could.

297
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,390
Sure.

298
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,810
Help me.

299
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,520
My sin...

300
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,110
is being born Jewish.

301
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,240
Sister Petra was a whore.

302
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,530
She was sold in the latrines
of Florence and nobody cared.

303
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,040
But my father had
a circumcised cock.

304
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,250
That was the unforgivable sin.

305
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,010
You just found out about
my secret lover.

306
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,390
You call that love?

307
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,810
God will speak to you
in many languages.

308
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,030
If your heart is brave enough
to open up to it.

309
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,350
Step aside!

310
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,430
Let the Abbess pass.

311
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,100
It hurts!

312
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,230
I'm being tortured!

313
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,900
Hold her leg.
Careful.

314
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,240
It'll be OK.

315
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,500
Tie her up.

316
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,420
Go get the doctors.

317
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,980
- How is she doing?
- She drank poppy juice.

318
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,190
- She's sleeping.
- What was wrong?

319
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,770
I didn't find anything abnormal.

320
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,900
- Yet she is in great pain.
- She screamed for hours without stopping.

321
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,860
There is black bile
in her urine.

322
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,370
This is common.

323
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,620
And if it starts again?

324
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,290
I'll leave you some poppy juice.

325
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,870
Twenty dinari.

326
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,730
Why are you so cruel?

327
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,330
You want to be with me?

328
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,880
Me, I want to be with you.

329
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,340
Jesus!

330
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,220
Oh thank you, my sweet Jesus.

331
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,310
Benedetta,

332
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,560
- I'll heal your wound.
- You are not Jesus.

333
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,350
I am Jesus.

334
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,730
You are my wife.

335
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,940
No!
It's not true!

336
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,320
Give yourself to me!

337
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,990
Bitch!
I'll cut you to pieces!

338
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,030
Here.

339
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,250
You are going to have
a cellmate.

340
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,550
Thank you.

341
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,770
Benedetta.

342
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,810
Are you feeling better?

343
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,650
I feel as God pleases
that I feel.

344
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,360
I have decided to put
someone by your side.

345
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,900
She will stay with you
day and night, take care of you,

346
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,660
will pray with you.

347
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,200
Will give you
your medicine if needed.

348
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,450
I'm sorry to be a burden.

349
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,370
We'll see if that helps.

350
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,590
Bartolomea was the only one who
volunteered for this task.

351
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,180
I hope there is something
providential in this choice.

352
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,310
Perhaps a lesson in forgiveness.

353
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,270
Why are you here?

354
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
To torment me?

355
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,150
What have I done
that makes you think so?

356
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,040
How do you put
anything in there?

357
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,930
That is the dress I was wearing when I
got here.

358
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
And this?

359
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,820
It was my mother's.

360
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,040
She gave it to me
when I was little.

361
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,920
So we're going to put it ... there.

362
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,020
I have been deceived by the devil.

363
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,020
He made me hurt you.

364
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,650
But you came back.

365
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,450
Did you get out of bed yet?

366
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,660
I try to make myself useful.

367
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,870
The Reverend Mother asked me for
help with the accounts.

368
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,500
What is that?

369
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,540
Numbers.

370
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,340
I don't know them.

371
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,840
I could teach you.

372
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,340
Ah... I'm not good
at learning, myself.

373
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,100
All warm and cosy!

374
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,220
Anything else?

375
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,270
No thanks.
I have to go to bed.

376
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,660
Can't I just have a look?

377
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,370
We are not allowed
to be naked in front of others.

378
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,790
Really?

379
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,560
I saw you!

380
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,020
It was a joke.

381
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,900
You are the only one who
finds them funny, your jokes.

382
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,730
Possibly.

383
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,950
I saw your breasts.

384
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,670
I saw them.

385
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,150
Benedetta...

386
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,030
Benedetta!

387
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,460
Do you want to suffer to show
your love for me?

388
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,470
Remove your clothes.

389
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,470
We are forbidden to be naked
in the presence of another.

390
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,350
Where I am,

391
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,770
there can be no shame.

392
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,690
Do what I say.

393
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,690
Yes, Lord.

394
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,270
I obey.

395
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,870
Come to me.

396
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,430
Remove everything that separates us.

397
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,110
Put your hands on mine.

398
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,710
Oh, the pain.

399
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,760
Oh my God.
Oh my God, that hurts!

400
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,970
It's too much!
I can't take it anymore.

401
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,200
Help me.

402
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,530
Help me. Help me.

403
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,780
It was Jesus who did this to me.

404
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,950
Last night.

405
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,280
He did this to me.

406
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,870
And there too.

407
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,870
The stigmata!

408
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,230
Were you praying
when it happened?

409
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,110
I was in my bed.
Asleep.

410
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,700
That's when it happened.

411
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,410
Saint Francis was in prayer
when he received the stigmata.

412
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,410
Catherine of Siena too.

413
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,040
Neither was sleeping.

414
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,710
I was sleeping.

415
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,500
- Jesus made me these marks.
- It was Jesus. I saw it.

416
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,000
Ah! You saw it?

417
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,470
I heard him speak.

418
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,380
What did he say?

419
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,890
I do not remember.

420
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:51,940
I thought the word of God
would make a bigger impression on you.

421
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,480
Take Sister Benedetta
to my room.

422
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,300
Can you open the screen?

423
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,060
I clean her wounds,
but they start to bleed again.

424
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,970
They are very deep.

425
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,440
Look.

426
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,320
Her feet are in the same condition.

427
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,660
- And her side?
- Worse.

428
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,370
How is it possible ?

429
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,870
I don't know.
I've never seen this before.

430
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,710
What can we do?

431
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,330
Keep them clean.

432
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,040
Change the dressings
every two hours.

433
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,710
Take off her wimple.

434
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,720
No blood.

435
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,100
I'm in pain.

436
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,770
When they placed
the crown of thorns on him,

437
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,730
Jesus' forehead bled.

438
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,280
I see nothing.

439
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,530
Dress her wounds.

440
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,200
And tight.

441
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,700
Do you have any doubts?

442
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,620
The girl was in bed.

443
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,630
No miracle happens
in a bed, trust me.

444
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,550
So, what am I writing?

445
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:47,630
The lack of signs on her head
is disturbing.

446
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,010
In all documented cases
of stigmata,

447
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,480
they refer to marks left
by the crown of thorns.

448
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,350
But God is not bound
by any written law.

449
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,860
Do we agree?

450
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,650
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my child?

451
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,030
- Can I go?
- But of course.

452
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,410
Would you like a glass of wine?

453
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,000
With pleasure.

454
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,580
Leave me, I need to pray.

455
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,260
Do you think I am too hasty
in believing in this miracle?

456
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,480
My dear provost, I
don't think you believe it at all.

457
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,270
Am I that cynical?

458
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,560
Maybe.

459
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,940
Unless I myself have
a vision.

460
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,650
It's possible.

461
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,910
A vision of Saint Francis
perhaps.

462
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:56,250
Assisi was an insignificant village.
Today, pilgrims flock there.

463
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,670
And fill its two basilicas.

464
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:02,540
Administered by a bishop,
not by a provost.

465
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,590
Ah Jesus, what's happening to me?

466
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,900
<i>Blasphemy!</i>

467
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,020
<i>Know, O sinners,</i>

468
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,230
<i>that when the plague hits
every corner of the country,</i>

469
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,610
<i>Pescia was spared
by the grace alone</i>

470
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,780
<i>of My wife.</i>

471
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,410
<i>You harass, torment</i>

472
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,620
<i>and persecute the
one who protected you.</i>

473
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,840
- What did you see?
- She fell.

474
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,680
A timely miracle.

475
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:02,100
Your Grace, all of this has gone too far.
We really have to...

476
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,860
Do you want to wreak
havoc on us?

477
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,820
You have heard the words spoken.

478
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,820
- I heard words.
- Are you mocking me?

479
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,990
These words, disturbing as
they are, are those of God.

480
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,080
I feel it deep in my soul.

481
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,500
This miracle
is the glory of the Théatines,

482
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,210
how can you not see it?

483
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,960
I see it, your Grace.

484
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,720
You play the docile one...

485
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,140
but you will stab me
as soon as my back is turned.

486
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,550
Well...

487
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,770
we will see if God gives us
everything we want.

488
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,610
Praise be to Benedetta.

489
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,820
Saint Benedetta.

490
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,330
People believe
that Benedetta is a saint.

491
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,700
But we know
it doesn't make sense.

492
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,540
Really?

493
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,540
You were amazed
at the absence of a wound on her forehead

494
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,090
and suddenly she breaks a glass
and a wound appears.

495
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,380
Did you see her?
Were you there?

496
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,350
- No.
- So you don't know anything.

497
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,770
I didn't see anything...

498
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,940
- but I know.
- But how do you know?

499
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,940
God showed it to you?

500
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,400
Did you have a vision too?

501
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,120
Why are you defending her?

502
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,510
We do not always understand
the instruments of God.

503
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,010
Maybe he put Benedetta
in a trance and it's in this state

504
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,930
that she hurt herself.

505
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,980
Or God
sent us a crazy woman...

506
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,900
who spouts nonsense
to serve his purposes.

507
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,950
I want you to give me your heart.

508
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,450
But won't I die
without my heart?

509
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,960
You will live.
Do you love me?

510
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,710
How can I love you without my heart?

511
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,880
I'll give you a new one.
Mine.

512
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,090
Bartolomea.

513
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:47,310
- What's the matter?
- Jesus gave me a new heart.

514
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,770
It's so big!

515
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,650
Too big for my chest.

516
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,320
Feel it!

517
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,450
Feel how big it is.

518
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,010
Yes! I can feel it... Yes.

519
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,060
- What's the matter?
- Benedetta had a nightmare.

520
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,690
Everything's fine.

521
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,440
Good night.

522
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,980
Go to bed.

523
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,750
A wonderful thing has happened to us.

524
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,380
Jesus Christ chose
our blessed sister,

525
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,630
Benedetta.

526
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,760
We have seen her wounds,

527
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,760
they are those of Jesus!

528
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,560
Praise be to God!

529
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,480
PRAISE BE GOD!

530
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,480
Jesus chose her.

531
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,980
And that's why we,

532
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,520
invested by the powers
of his Church,

533
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,400
choose Benedetta as abbess

534
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,320
of the Theatines Convent.

535
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:09,330
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

536
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,120
- AMEN.
- Amen.

537
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,410
Let us pray, Lord God!

538
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,170
It's impossible.

539
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,800
Sister Christina,
what's wrong with you?

540
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,640
With all due respect,
father,

541
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,850
it's up to us,

542
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,770
we, the sisters of this convent,

543
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,070
to choose a new Abbess.

544
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,610
- To us alone.
- It was Jesus who chose.

545
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,610
Your Lord and Master.

546
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,030
It is God's will.

547
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,990
But who decides
what the will of God is?

548
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,120
Isn't it us sisters ...

549
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,450
Christina !

550
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:54,870
Get out.

551
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,290
Now.

552
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,140
The matter is finished.

553
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:19,270
I ask the Reverend Mother
to relinquish her duties.

554
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,080
Sister Benedetta,

555
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,580
come forward.

556
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:27,130
- Say it again, I like it.
- Your Majesty.

557
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,810
It bounces.

558
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,400
- It's my bed.
- It's soft.

559
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,530
And it's all for us.

560
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:08,090
Sister Jacopa has fallen!
She can't move!

561
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,140
She won't make it through the day.

562
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,400
Reverend Mother,
I will stay with her.

563
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,030
Sure.

564
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,030
But if she doesn't give up the ghost before
Vespers, you leave her bedside.

565
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,200
This will be my first Mass,
as an Abbess

566
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,950
and Jesus told me
that you must be present.

567
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,830
Fine, Reverend Mother.

568
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,920
I will stay with Sister Jacopa
until dawn, if I have to.

569
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,750
Perfect.

570
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,590
Jesus didn't tell me anything about you.

571
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,020
Mud is thrown in your face
and you say nothing.

572
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,020
Those are the rules of the game.

573
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,560
In the end,
everyone wins.

574
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:11,360
The provost will have his episcopate
and the Théatines will benefit from it.

575
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,740
It that important ?

576
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,320
It may be vain and unnecessary,
but I have devoted my life to it.

577
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,250
I had a life to give,
I chose this convent and ...

578
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,290
perhaps he chose me.

579
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,920
- But my mother, you can't ...
- Call me "Sister Felicita".

580
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,010
But people need to know.
What is happening here is blasphemy.

581
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,600
Those who matter already know that.

582
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,770
If they don't denounce Benedetta,

583
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,730
it is because they do not want
it to be denounced.

584
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,900
If you do, they will destroy you.

585
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,730
You will be alone.

586
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,280
I won't defend you.

587
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:00,120
It's time for Vespers,
Sister Felicita.

588
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,370
Lies...

589
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,910
My father,

590
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,210
I want to confess.

591
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:33,380
- At this hour?
- You have to, father.

592
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:37,340
You have refused to bow down
before God, do you repent?

593
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:40,590
The Lord taught me
never to lie.

594
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,260
This is what leads me
to repentance.

595
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,660
Speak. Renew the bonds
that unite you with the living Lord.

596
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:15,210
Regarding Sister Benedetta,
I must tell you that ...

597
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,090
Your Reverend Mother?

598
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,590
Yes.

599
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,630
Yes, I'm talking about the Reverend Mother.

600
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,720
She's a false prophetess.

601
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,600
Her miracle was fake.
She created her stigmata.

602
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:32,600
You are in confession.
Do you want to blame others?

603
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:35,440
I blame myself... of being silent.

604
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:36,900
Out of cowardice.

605
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,200
Do you have any proof?

606
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,870
The stigmata ... on her head.

607
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,790
She used
a piece of glass

608
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,660
to cut her forehead
and make it bleed.

609
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,710
Did you witness it?

610
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,880
Yes.

611
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:14,100
The three.

612
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,440
This is a ...?

613
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,650
- Four.
- Yes go ahead.

614
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,950
No no, you press too hard.

615
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,580
Let's start over.

616
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,370
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

617
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:37,960
Go on.

618
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,030
Come.

619
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,620
Come.

620
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,390
Do you want to see them?

621
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,350
Show me.

622
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,200
Go deeeper.

623
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,870
Deeper!

624
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,950
Ah, I can't.

625
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,210
My hand is too big.

626
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:06,880
Do you want to taste?

627
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,780
Oh my God.

628
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,030
My God.

629
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:45,210
No...

630
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,920
No! No!

631
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,920
- Oh no.
- Yes, you can.

632
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,840
Come on, cum now!

633
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,420
Come on!

634
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,310
It just won't stop!

635
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,940
Oh sweet Jesus...

636
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:29,750
You want more?

637
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:31,520
Today's reading
is taken from Leviticus.

638
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,070
But before we start,

639
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,610
I will address some questions

640
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,820
that trouble the hearts of our sisters.

641
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,450
Sister Christina.

642
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:45,410
If there is something
that concerns you,

643
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,750
you have a duty to express it.

644
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,460
Do you want me ... to
talk now?

645
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,840
- Here?
- Where else?

646
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,800
Pour out your heart.
Get up, speak!

647
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,730
Come on, talk!

648
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,610
Our Mother Superior...

649
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,700
deceives us

650
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,570
and lies to us.

651
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,290
Dear sister, explain yourself.

652
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:31,710
Do you have any complaints
regarding our Reverend Mother?

653
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,000
I just know that ...

654
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,170
That...

655
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,710
What do you know, my sister?

656
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,720
Benedetta deceives us.

657
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,180
She inflicted
the marks on her forehead.

658
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,980
When she fell

659
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,560
she broke glass
and wounded herself with it.

660
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:55,730
I saw it.

661
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,150
My dear sister, what are you saying?

662
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,110
I'm sure that the other signs
appeared in the same way.

663
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,780
Sister Christina,

664
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,160
you have seen

665
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,490
our Reverend Mother cut herself
with a shard of glass?

666
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,830
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

667
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,960
And I reported it to the Abbess.

668
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,470
What did you tell him?

669
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:26,010
What I saw.

670
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:28,720
What Sister Benedetta did.

671
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,390
You are aware

672
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,980
that false testimony
is a mortal sin?

673
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,150
I am not lying.

674
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:46,160
Sister Felicita,

675
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:47,990
come forward.

676
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:06,550
Did Sister Christina tell you

677
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,680
about having seen Sister Benedetta

678
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,350
inflict injuries on her forehead?

679
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:15,350
She had serious doubts.

680
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,350
But did she see her do it?

681
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,770
She did not tell me that
she witnessed it directly ...

682
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:25,280
Directly ... Did
she witness it or not?

683
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:30,700
No.

684
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,910
She did not witness it.

685
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,250
You lied to us!

686
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,300
<i>She doesn't believe in me!</i>

687
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:47,880
<i>It is Satan who possesses her.</i>

688
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,840
<i>She must be punished.</i>

689
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:53,220
<i>The flogging!
She must flog herself!</i>

690
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:56,390
The devil must be driven
from your body!

691
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,940
Strip yourself!

692
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:16,830
Free yourself from the demon.

693
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,040
Strike yourself, my dear sister.

694
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,950
Finally!

695
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,960
The rain has stopped.

696
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,170
I have a gift for you.

697
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,640
It'll go further than my fingers.
You want to try?

698
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,900
It's a bit rough.

699
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,740
Oh yeah.
I'll take care of it.

700
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,660
Take that off.

701
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:47,540
- It made you happy, right?
- What made me happy?

702
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:50,090
Seeing Christina whipping herself.
I saw you.

703
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,840
Ah... No that's not true.

704
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,260
It was after.

705
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,430
I thought about you.

706
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,310
How it would be with you.

707
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:13,070
Shall we try it?

708
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,580
Very smooth.

709
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,010
- Ah!
- Does it hurt?

710
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,550
No, it feels good.

711
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,880
Is there a fire?

712
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:34,190
- Is it a star?
- A comet.

713
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:09,810
The comet is above
our convent.

714
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:13,270
- What does it mean?
- It's a warning from God.

715
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,900
Something terrible is
going to happen.

716
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,820
Christina, don't!

717
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,100
Christina!

718
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,620
Christina! Christina!

719
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,650
What did you do?

720
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,400
What did you do?

721
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:40,320
You silly little girl,
what did you do?

722
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,160
I'm going to lay my hands on her

723
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,530
and intercede for the salvation of her soul.

724
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,950
Intercede? Don't touch her!

725
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,910
We have to!

726
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:55,540
The soul of a suicide goes straight to hell,
but I can intervene.

727
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:58,380
Take your hands off!
Go away!

728
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,880
One word from me and Jesus will reach
out to save her from the flames.

729
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:05,550
You're the one who'll be roasting in hell!

730
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,510
Stop!

731
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,770
Stop!

732
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:16,770
Lying bitch!
Whore!

733
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:20,340
She gave me an order.

734
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,710
- She's no longer our abbess but ...
- Where did she go?

735
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,260
To Florence.

736
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:36,850
Sister Felicita is gone.

737
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,020
She is on her way to Florence.

738
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,980
To do what?

739
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,490
To talk to the nuncio, I guess.

740
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:50,820
What does she want to tell him?

741
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:56,750
What are you afraid she'll say to him?

742
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,000
All of it.

743
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,500
What do you mean by that?

744
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,590
That my miracles are not real?

745
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,720
I'm not talking about that.

746
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,430
That...

747
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,690
I cut myself
with a tiny piece of glass?

748
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:23,730
That's what you did, no?

749
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:26,780
Right?

750
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:29,320
I don't know.

751
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,330
I don't know how God
makes things happen.

752
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:37,000
I know he is doing
his will through me.

753
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,170
It's not just my flesh.

754
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,590
It's his too.

755
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,880
Stop it!
You disgust me.

756
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,270
That's what you're afraid of.

757
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:05,110
What Sister Felicita
could tell about us,

758
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:06,440
what we do.

759
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:15,740
Do you think we should be ashamed of this?

760
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:23,420
Shame does not exist under
the protection of God's love.

761
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,090
The love of God?

762
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,340
You only love yourself.

763
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:36,560
- Come closer, then.
- No!

764
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,900
Just your breasts.

765
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:49,030
Please.

766
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,430
Sweet Jesus, no!

767
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:17,970
Don't ask me that, please!

768
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:20,350
Benedetta?

769
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:40,160
The sisters must dig a grave.

770
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,180
Where's Teresa?

771
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:47,810
At the hospital. She won't survive,
Your Excellency.

772
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,650
Probably not, no.

773
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,940
It's been three since Sunday,
but I'm not afraid.

774
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,070
Maybe
because you are too full of life.

775
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:02,830
A few more weeks
and he'll be here. I already have milk.

776
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,540
That's enough.

777
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,840
Would you like to add anything?

778
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:22,050
I told you everything.
It's in your hands now.

779
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:29,060
Extraordinary charges
require extraordinary evidence.

780
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:31,350
I only told the truth.

781
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,770
You can doubt
my motives,

782
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:35,440
but come to Pescia

783
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,650
and you will see for yourself.

784
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,740
If you want to take an honest look.

785
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,080
If there is devilry in Pescia,
I'll know how to unmask it.

786
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:56,460
If this sister is guilty
of the blasphemy of which you accuse her,

787
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:58,340
she will go to the stake.

788
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,550
But if your testimony is false ...

789
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:05,010
What are we going to do with you?

790
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:07,060
Who can saY?

791
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,640
Oh yes...

792
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:14,400
Me.

793
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:26,160
Our Lord!

794
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,410
Jesus!

795
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,890
Lord, have mercy!

796
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,810
Jesus!

797
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,900
Have mercy on us!

798
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:21,590
It is a sign of the Judgment of God!

799
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,510
"The third angel sounded
his trumpet

800
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,010
"and
a star that burned like a torch fell from heaven.

801
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:31,430
"Its pestilence will poison a
third of the waters."

802
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,480
It's the plague!
It is the instrument to punish us!

803
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,610
The plague will befall Pescia!

804
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:53,830
No...

805
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,150
Thank you Lord.

806
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:24,610
Thank you!

807
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,910
Do not be afraid.

808
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,330
The comet is the sign
that the Lord is protecting us.

809
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,080
The plague will not affect Pescia.

810
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:42,710
Jesus promised me, his bride,

811
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,880
that this city would be spared!

812
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:47,090
Lord Jesus, protect us!

813
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:50,720
Protect our city!

814
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:53,010
Thank you, Lord Jesus!

815
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:57,980
O sweet Jesus,

816
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:01,020
we know you are here with us.

817
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:02,980
Thank you, my God.

818
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:15,580
Close the city gates.
Don't let anyone through.

819
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:22,250
It is the will of the Lord.
Close the doors now.

820
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,480
My sister?

821
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:47,190
What's going on?

822
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:49,400
I don't know.

823
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:50,990
Benedetta!

824
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:53,370
Benedetta!

825
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,290
Is the grave for you?

826
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:04,590
Answer me.

827
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,290
A letter!

828
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:42,000
It fell from the sky!
The end is near!

829
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:45,000
Ring the bell!

830
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:48,000
It is written.
Read it!

831
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:50,050
It's a letter from God!

832
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:03,520
Nuncio!
Give me absolution.

833
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,190
Your Excellency, I am dying.

834
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,360
Don't let me die like this.

835
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:12,070
Ask the
priest of your parish for absolution .

836
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,490
It's me.
It is I, the priest of the parish.

837
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:21,620
To the left!

838
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:23,830
I got it!

839
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,640
Open the doors for the nuncio!

840
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:40,970
The doors remain closed.

841
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,980
No one comes in, no one leaves.

842
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,110
I am the nuncio of Florence.
Open those doors!

843
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:49,860
For the Pope, it would be the same.
We do not open.

844
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:52,530
You are under my authority,
that of the Church!

845
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:55,910
Here we are
under the authority of Jesus himself!

846
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:58,030
The doors remain closed.

847
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:07,130
Your excellence.

848
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,630
I am the provost of Pescia.

849
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:13,630
Alfonso Giglioli,
representative of the Pope,

850
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,630
I must speak to the abbess
of the Theatines convent.

851
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,930
I regret
to inform you:

852
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:21,720
the Most Holy Benedetta
died this afternoon.

853
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:27,230
We are sorry that you have
that you have made the journey.

854
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:30,480
I will celebrate the funeral mass.
Lead me to her.

855
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:31,860
Let's go!

856
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,610
The plague must remain
outside our walls.

857
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:40,530
Anyone who wants to enter
must be examined by our doctors.

858
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:43,700
- Even you, Excellency.
- It is God who sends us.

859
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:46,160
You are not
going to stop us.

860
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,330
We're coming in!

861
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:07,310
Make way, move along!

862
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,900
Step aside!

863
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,480
Open the door.

864
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,240
It is an honor to welcome
your Excellency.

865
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:41,220
- Did you put on a show?
- No, Your Excellency.

866
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,550
Before she died,
our mother told us

867
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,640
how God wanted
to celebrate her ascension.

868
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:50,140
- Another of her visions?
- Yes, that's exactly it.

869
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:52,940
Her coffin was to be carried
by nine novices

870
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:54,770
dressed as angels.

871
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:02,160
Who was that?

872
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,970
The skin is intact.

873
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,970
No sign of the plague.

874
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:28,390
- Did she receive the last rites?
- No, her death was too sudden.

875
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,520
I will administer them to her.

876
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:32,650
Make the preparations.

877
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:35,310
So, are you happy?

878
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:38,150
I never wanted
her to die.

879
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,530
Not so fast, anyway.

880
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:57,040
Through this holy anointing

881
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,310
Jesus, hold me.

882
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:13,060
Don't let me go!

883
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:16,060
I want to stay with you.

884
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:29,540
I was in heaven,
in perfect peace.

885
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,120
But I was torn from it

886
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:35,330
like a baby from its mother's womb.
I was sent back...

887
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:39,380
Jesus brought me back here to Earth.

888
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:41,670
For what reason, my mother?

889
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:46,260
I have seen the souls of those
who will soon die.

890
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:52,680
I have seen all your souls
and I have shed torrents of tears.

891
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:56,940
You saw mine too,
I suppose?

892
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,610
Jesus sent me back here

893
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:03,820
to save you from the plague
and what awaits you afterwards.

894
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,360
The eternal flames of hell.

895
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:09,580
Don't worry about
the flames of hell, my mother.

896
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:13,700
It is the flames of this world
that will consume you.

897
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:16,710
The Black Death approaches Pescia.

898
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:18,880
It watches, sharpening it's scythe.

899
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,300
I saw the bloated bodies,
the blood.

900
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:23,840
Rich and poor, women and children.

901
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:26,970
And Jesus, too, was there.

902
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,470
He said as long as I live, so do
you.

903
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:34,020
You are accused of blasphemy,

904
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:37,350
of heresy and bestiality.

905
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:40,730
Your trial will begin tomorrow.

906
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:08,590
We haven't found anything,
Your Excellency.

907
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,890
Have you searched everything?
Ripped open the mattresses? The cushions?

908
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:15,060
Yes, your Excellency.
Nothing.

909
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:18,890
It's this big.

910
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:22,060
It has to be there somewhere.
Keep looking.

911
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:25,360
What are you going to tell them?

912
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,570
The truth, what else?

913
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,910
You can also tell them something else.

914
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,880
Novice Bartolomea, stand up.

915
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,250
Stand up!

916
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,090
Well.

917
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:54,680
Sister Felicita, now tell us
what you saw.

918
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:58,310
I have no words
to describe these acts.

919
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,690
Do your best.

920
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:06,530
I saw this girl
in carnal embraces

921
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:09,240
with the mother superior, Benedetta.

922
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:11,910
Can you be more specific?

923
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:15,950
They used each other,

924
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:18,910
each in turn,

925
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:21,580
like a man with a woman.

926
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:25,590
And how were you able to
witness these acts?

927
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:30,670
Through a peephole that I myself drilled
in the wall of my old bedroom.

928
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,970
And that is not a mortal sin?

929
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,800
Spying on her superior?

930
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:37,890
Today, we do not judge
the former abbess.

931
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,850
How do you know
if this woman's statements

932
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:43,650
are not dictated by jealousy?
Or spite?

933
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:47,320
Sister Felicita's testimony
is only the beginning, not the end.

934
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:50,150
Bartolomea,

935
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,410
What do you have to say
to Sister Felicita's accusation?

936
01:37:53,570 --> 01:37:55,280
Is she telling the truth?

937
01:37:56,330 --> 01:37:58,240
- I don't understand.
- Sorry?

938
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:01,040
I don't even understand
what she's saying.

939
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:04,830
Did you look
lustfully at Abbess Benedetta?

940
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,880
From one woman to another,
it is impossible.

941
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:11,090
Apparently, this convent
widens the horizon of the possible.

942
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,680
Bartolomea,

943
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:18,260
have you, yes or no, looked at
the abbess Benedetta with lust?

944
01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:23,810
With love.

945
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:29,360
All I feel for Mother
Benedetta is love.

946
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:32,700
The same that I feel
for all my sisters.

947
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:35,360
But you didn't express it,
this love,

948
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:38,280
to your other sisters
the same way, right?

949
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:39,660
No!

950
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:42,250
Sister Felicita,

951
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:46,040
by what means,
the novice Bartolomea

952
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:49,750
did she express her love
for the Mother Superior?

953
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:55,590
She used a wooden statuette

954
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,930
of the Blessed Virgin

955
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,430
to penetrate

956
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,470
Benedetta's genitals
and make her orgasm.

957
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:06,690
A wicked crime.

958
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:10,440
It is a sacrilegious inversion
of the natural order.

959
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:14,700
An abomination that deserves
the ultimate punishment:

960
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:16,320
the pyre.

961
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:19,070
It's not true.
It's not true.

962
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:26,710
You can still save your soul,
my child,

963
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:28,960
if you confess.

964
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:37,840
I have nothing to confess,
Your Excellency.

965
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:51,820
If you know,
why do you want me to confess?

966
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:54,110
Your confession will lessen your sin.

967
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,320
You can still spare yourself the stake
and Benedetta too.

968
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,260
No.

969
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:26,020
Undress her.

970
01:40:56,670 --> 01:41:00,050
You can save your soul if you talk.

971
01:41:03,050 --> 01:41:04,350
OK.

972
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:12,520
I confess.
I had horrible thoughts!

973
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:16,360
Sister Juliana, I hate her!
I wanted her to die.

974
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:17,780
Let me go!

975
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,870
My child,

976
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:27,540
that is not what
we want to hear.

977
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:44,470
The "Pear of Anguish".

978
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:50,680
Have you ever seen
something like this?

979
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,820
Joan of Arc was
a courageous warrior ...

980
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,980
her enemies recognized it.

981
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,530
Yet she confessed her sins

982
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:05,410
when she was shown
the instruments of torture.

983
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:10,540
No need to pretend
you're braver than Joan of Arc.

984
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:14,670
No need to pretend
anything for that matter.

985
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:16,920
I have already confessed.

986
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:20,340
I told you I wanted to kill
Sister Juliana.

987
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:22,470
I am guilty of murder.

988
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:26,050
Have mercy.

989
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,240
I confessed!

990
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:50,540
We don't know each other yet,
you and me,

991
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,580
but we're in the same boat.

992
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:55,500
The journey can be long,

993
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,420
it can be short.

994
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,090
Let us pray to God to light our way.

995
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,420
No no no!

996
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:58,230
Come in!

997
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:11,830
What do you think love is?

998
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:18,710
I think that...

999
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:21,380
it is not feeling alone.

1000
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:24,760
It is...

1001
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,340
a warmth there.

1002
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,260
Do you have sore feet?

1003
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:46,400
Are you, an abbess,
washing my feet?

1004
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:51,910
As a novice, I washed them
more often than I had to.

1005
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,500
Have you never touched a man?

1006
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:59,960
- No.
- Why?

1007
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:03,790
Because you are insensitive
to a woman's natural desires.

1008
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,380
I only desire for God.

1009
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:19,890
Are you trying to seduce me?

1010
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,480
Where did you learn
these whore's skills?

1011
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,860
I don't know much about whore's skills.

1012
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:28,360
And I won't ask
you how you know anything about them.

1013
01:45:45,210 --> 01:45:48,010
To play with me
is to play with fire.

1014
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:50,420
Literally.

1015
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:52,220
I am not afraid.

1016
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:54,050
Sure.

1017
01:45:55,180 --> 01:45:57,890
You advance dressed
in the armor of light.

1018
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:01,230
Love is the only armor
I need.

1019
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:04,100
The love of Christ,
is that what you mean?

1020
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:05,980
Or the love of Bartolomea?

1021
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:09,820
Bartolomea's too.

1022
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:12,360
So Jesus must share?

1023
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,660
It is with joy that he shares everything.

1024
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:20,000
With all of humanity.

1025
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:23,920
The warmth you mentioned ...
there.

1026
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:27,170
It is not love
for all of humanity.

1027
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,500
It is something special.

1028
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,880
Bartolomea is the individual.

1029
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:35,760
And through her,
I reach universal love.

1030
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:41,020
The universal reaches you through
a small piece of wood?

1031
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:58,580
Stay where you are!

1032
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:00,160
Bartolomea...

1033
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,370
I told them
you had deceived me.

1034
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:06,630
That you forced me to sin.

1035
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:10,380
Lies from your mouth.

1036
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:12,510
I don't want to suffer for you anymore!

1037
01:47:12,670 --> 01:47:13,840
Go to hell!

1038
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:16,470
Are you ready to confess
now?

1039
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:28,360
There it is,
the proof you're looking for.

1040
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:46,330
Here is your love, Benedetta.

1041
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:54,380
<i>Blasphemy!</i>

1042
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:55,840
<i>Blasphemy!</i>

1043
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,590
<i>You're making fun</i>

1044
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,930
<i>of My wife as they made fun
of Me on the cross!</i>

1045
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:02,260
<i>Sacrilege!</i>

1046
01:48:02,430 --> 01:48:04,350
<i>You have all been judged!</i>

1047
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,520
<i>You, Alfonso Giglioli,</i>

1048
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:08,770
<i>you have been judged.</i>

1049
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:11,190
<i>And you will pay for your blasphemy</i>

1050
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,730
<i>with your blood,
black pus and blisters!</i>

1051
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:47,560
- When did that happen?
- An hour ago.

1052
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:49,060
Not a word.

1053
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:51,730
Move her into the basement.
Place a guard.

1054
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,020
No one should go in or out.

1055
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:56,480
And burn everything she touched.

1056
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:31,520
Keep your head up.

1057
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:36,270
There is one thing I learned from working
as a prostitute.

1058
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,820
The humiliation
leaves no mark.

1059
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,400
Thief!

1060
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:21,990
Get her!

1061
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:31,200
Pescia will not let the
one who protected her from the plague burn.

1062
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:35,960
The people have nothing to say,
the Church decides. Sign.

1063
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:39,340
Nuncio, the child was promised to God
from birth ...

1064
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:43,590
My father! Consider
your work finished.

1065
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:47,350
I have pity for her.
And love.

1066
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:51,350
But pity and love
have nothing to do with duty.

1067
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,940
The sentence ... is irrevocable.

1068
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:17,830
Excellence?

1069
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:19,340
Yes.

1070
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:22,210
Our sister Benedetta has a request.

1071
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:25,470
She would like to be allowed
to pray with Sister Felicita

1072
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:27,930
and to beg her forgiveness.

1073
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:31,310
She would also like

1074
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:33,680
to be carried to the square

1075
01:51:33,850 --> 01:51:37,650
on the back of a donkey, as Christ
entered Jerusalem.

1076
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:43,650
For the donkey, it's no of course.

1077
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:47,410
But I will allow her to put on
her little charade with sister Felicita.

1078
01:51:47,570 --> 01:51:51,200
We all have to play our part
to the end, right?

1079
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:53,870
Right.

1080
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:06,090
You can go.

1081
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:21,610
Are you happy
that I'm dying?

1082
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:26,150
I have come to tell you
what Jesus revealed to me:

1083
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:31,030
your daughter is waiting for you
with him.

1084
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:33,080
I don't believe a word of it.

1085
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,210
But she's not in hell.
There's always that.

1086
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:45,760
You gave your life to God
without ever believing in him.

1087
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:51,050
Now he should be
your comfort and your salvation.

1088
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:53,930
But you are alone
in the face of the terror of death.

1089
01:52:57,430 --> 01:53:00,350
God never spoke to me
like he speaks to you.

1090
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,320
He's talking to you right now.

1091
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,690
He speaks to you through pain.

1092
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:13,410
So he talks a lot.

1093
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:18,750
But I don't understand
what he wants to tell me.

1094
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:25,000
What is it?

1095
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:27,760
What is he telling you?

1096
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:30,510
Do you think I know that?

1097
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:33,430
Maybe, yes.

1098
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:37,020
Yes, you know that.

1099
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,140
Yes.

1100
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:45,610
Please tell me.

1101
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,740
Tell me...

1102
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:53,570
Tell me.

1103
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:08,590
Benedetta!

1104
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,930
Benedetta!
Benedetta!

1105
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:13,890
Forgive me!

1106
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:16,720
Benedetta!

1107
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:18,600
Benedetta, look at me!

1108
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:21,270
Forgive me!
Please.

1109
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:23,730
Tell me you don't hate me.

1110
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:27,770
It's fine.
I had to be betrayed.

1111
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,570
Death to the nonce!

1112
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,090
Set her free!

1113
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:04,770
Let me go!

1114
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:14,570
I grant you the mercy
of strangulation.

1115
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:16,950
You will not suffer
in the flames.

1116
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,910
But you have to make a confession.

1117
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:24,500
Renounce your vanity!

1118
01:55:25,290 --> 01:55:26,620
Confess!

1119
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:34,800
I will confess.

1120
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:40,260
Speak!

1121
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:51,070
Poor town of Pescia,

1122
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,860
I couldn't save you.

1123
01:55:55,610 --> 01:55:57,910
I could not
make you renounce evil.

1124
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,670
<i>You have betrayed My love!</i>

1125
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:15,470
<i>None of you will be spared!</i>

1126
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:17,590
<i>Death will blow through this town</i>

1127
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,680
<i>like a wind that mows down
everything in its path.</i>

1128
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:26,810
<i>See!</i>

1129
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:30,810
<i>The Angel of Death stretched out his hands.</i>

1130
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:33,940
<i>Death is here!</i>

1131
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:36,860
<i>It's already walking among you!</i>

1132
01:56:39,110 --> 01:56:40,990
<i>Angel of Death!</i>

1133
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:43,120
<i>Show your face!</i>

1134
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:59,930
He's the one who did this to me!

1135
01:57:00,090 --> 01:57:01,640
The nuncio!

1136
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,890
It was he
who brought the plague to Pescia!

1137
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:07,020
On you!

1138
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:09,600
- On your children!
- Enough!

1139
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:12,150
To the stake!

1140
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:14,110
Bring her to the stake!

1141
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:16,110
- To the stake!
- No!

1142
01:57:28,290 --> 01:57:30,160
No!
If she dies,

1143
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:32,130
we will all be cursed!

1144
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:33,580
It's the nuncio!

1145
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:36,460
It was the nuncio who brought death!

1146
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:39,340
It is the nuncio that must be burned!

1147
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:52,190
Die!

1148
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,260
Untie it!

1149
01:58:37,570 --> 01:58:38,570
Run away!

1150
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:53,580
Take the kiss of peace!

1151
01:59:00,510 --> 01:59:01,760
Get him!

1152
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:24,610
Benedetta!

1153
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:37,000
Benedetta!

1154
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:40,500
Benedetta!

1155
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:13,410
Do you want me to pray
for the salvation of your soul?

1156
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:17,710
When you died,

1157
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:20,500
did you see the other side?

1158
02:00:20,670 --> 02:00:23,000
Jesus showed me
the where every soul will go,

1159
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:24,960
past, present and future.

1160
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:27,220
And me,

1161
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:30,340
did you see me
in heaven or hell?

1162
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,390
In Paradise.

1163
02:00:38,730 --> 02:00:41,190
You have lied to the end.

1164
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:19,160
- What are you doing?
- I have to go back.

1165
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:25,750
But there's nothing more there.

1166
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:30,380
- Why are you going back?
- The convent is my home.

1167
02:02:30,550 --> 02:02:33,930
- I swore to spend my life there.
- It's all in the past.

1168
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:36,680
Not for me.

1169
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:42,060
We can go anywhere we want now.

1170
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:44,440
- You think so?
- Yes, anywhere!

1171
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,900
To Rome, Venice, Spain...

1172
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:49,190
And how would we eat?

1173
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:52,070
Would we steal?
Would we sell ourselves?

1174
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:58,240
There are worse things.
At least you would be alive.

1175
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:02,910
If you go back there,
they'll put you back on the stake.

1176
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:05,960
They won't burn me.

1177
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:08,630
Go on!
I will be protected.

1178
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,920
By who?
Your husband, Jesus?

1179
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:15,550
You still don't believe in me?

1180
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,890
- After everything you've seen?
- Looked.

1181
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:27,610
But I already explained it to you.
When God ...

1182
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:29,940
There is nobody, we are alone!

1183
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:32,860
You can admit it,
these are stories. Say it!

1184
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:36,910
Say it.

1185
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,040
If you care about me, say it.

1186
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:49,880
Say it!

1187
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:53,710
- Why, it's horrible!
- Because I don't want you to die.

1188
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:59,850
The people who were there for you yesterday
will throw you into the fire.

1189
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:07,270
You're right.

1190
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:12,020
They will tie me to the stake.

1191
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:13,780
They will set it on fire.

1192
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:18,110
The flames will lick me
but not burn me.

1193
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:21,030
God won't let them.

1194
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:24,160
And all will see it.

1195
02:04:24,330 --> 02:04:27,410
No one will be able to doubt,
ever again. Yourself...

1196
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:30,170
you will no longer doubt
or fear anything.

1197
02:04:30,330 --> 02:04:32,290
And that will be my gift to you.

1198
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,340
You're crazy...
You're crazy.

1199
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:42,350
You are just a child, Bartolomea.

1200
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:44,350
It's part of your charm.

1201
02:04:53,110 --> 02:04:54,480
Go away!

1202
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:56,820
Go away then!

1203
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:59,950
Go to hell!

1204
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:03,450
Let them burn you!

1205
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:07,540
Go away!

1206
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:37,680
The martyrdom was denied to sister Benedetta Carlini.

1207
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:42,880
She lived to be seventy years old,
cloistered in the convent of the Theatines.

1208
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:52,240
She could attend mass, and on occasion,
have dinner with her sisters, but seated on the floor.

1209
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:59,330
The plague that ravaged the country
totally spared the town of Pescia.

1209
02:06:00,305 --> 02:07:00,644
